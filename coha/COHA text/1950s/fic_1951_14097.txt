March 1937 . Granite and iron ! The corridor of an ancient Russian prison , buried deep underground . To the left , set into a soaring , Byzantine arch , is a thick iron portcullis . Beyond it , visible through the bars , a steep flight of stone steps curves up out of sight . To the right , a tier of cells forms an ominous column of sweating granite , towering up to vanish in the shadows above . A GUARD with rifle and bayonet paces the corridor . He halts as the iron portcullis slides up to the clangor of chains , revealing an OFFICER and a prisoner . The prisoner , N. S. RUBASHOV , is a short , stocky , smooth-shaven , bespectacled man in his early fifties . His head is large beyond the proportions of his body , and characterized by an expanse of forehead . His eyes are set far apart and Mongoloid in cast . He carries himself very erect and with fierce authority . The GUARD opens the door of a cell , throws a switch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner is pushed inside . The door clangs behind him . The heavy metallic sound of bolts being closed and a key turned . The prisoner surveys his cell slowly : a solid , windowless cubicle with an iron bed and a straw mattress , nothing else . There is no day here , no night ; it is a timeless dank grave for the living corpse . He reaches into his pocket automatically for cigarettes , then he remembers , turns to the judas hole and observes the eye of the GUARD staring at him . RUBASHOV Comrade guard ! He turns his empty pockets inside out.They 've taken away my cigarettes , too ! Can you get me a cigarette ? p. 3 GUARD harshly:It 's late , go to bed . RUBASHOV I 've been dragged out of a sickbed . I have a fever . I need some cigarettes . GUARD mutters:Your mother ! Turns out the light in the cell , leaving the prisoner lit only by the light streaming through the judas hole . The GUARD goes out . RUBASHOV rubs his inflamed cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes off his coat , slowly , painfully ; throws it on the cot , murmurs to himself:So , it 's come . You 're to die , Rubashov . Well , the old guard is gone ! He sits on the bed ; rolls up his coat for a pillow , murmuring to himself.For golden lads and girls all must as chimney sweepers come to dust . He takes off his spectacles , places them on the floor , and lies back , staring grimly at the ceiling.Yes . The old guard is gone . He sighs again , repeats mechanically.For golden lads and girls all must A ticking sound is heard . Three ticks , then a pause , then three more ticks . He sits up , listening as chimney sweepers The ticking becomes louder . He picks up his spectacles , rises , glances at the judas hole to make certain he is not being observed , places his ear to one wall , taps on it with his spectacles , listens , then tries another wall . Returning to the wall left , he listens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering taps become louder . He repeats the series , placing his ear to the wall ; the taps now come in a different series , louder , rapid , more excited.Easy ! Slow . Slow . He taps slowly , deliberately . The answering taps slow down.That 's better . He counts the taps , 5-3 , W ; 2-3 , H ; 3-5 , O. " Who ? " The prisoner smiles and addresses himself softly to the wall.Direct enough , are n't you , Comrade ? The lights come up in the adjoining cell , the wall dissolves , the prisoner in 402 appears . He is verminous , caked with filth , his hair matted , his old Tsarist uniform in rags , but he has somehow preserved his monocle and the tatters of an old illusion . He strokes his moustache and swaggers about as if he were still a perfumed dandy . p. 4 402 as he taps on the wall , his lips unconsciously form the words and utter them . In their communications by tapping , all the prisoners unconsciously voice the messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as RUBASHOV shakes his head but does n't answer . Taps again.Is it day or night outside ? RUBASHOV glances again at the judas hole , taps:Four A.M. 402 taps : What day ? RUBASHOV taps:Tuesday. 402 taps:Month ? RUBASHOV taps:March 402 taps:Year ? RUBASHOV taps:1937. 402 taps:The weather ? RUBASHOV taps:Snowing. 402 to himself:Snow . Taps.Who are you ? RUBASHOV to himself:Well , why not ? He taps.Nicolai Semonovitch Rubashov. p. 5 402 straightens up with a cry:Rubashov ? He bursts into wild , ugly laughter . He taps.The wolves are devouring each other ! Crosses over to the opposite wall . Taps three times , and listens , his ear to the wall . The cell above lights up and the occupant rises painfully from his cot . He is a young man , thin , with a white ghostlike face , bruises and burns on it , and a split lip . He crosses with effort to the wall , taps three times , then listens as 402 taps.New prisoner . Rubashov. 302 taps:Nicolai Rubashov ? 402 laughing hoarsely as he taps:N . S. Rubashov . Ex-Commissar of the People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Army , Bearer of the Order of the Red Banner . Pass it along . 302 crouches , stunned , cries out suddenly:Oh ! Father , Father , what have I done ? He crosses to the opposite wall , taps three times . An answering tap is heard . The cell above lights up ; 202 , a peasant , with insane eyes , puts his head to the floor as 302 taps . 302 taps:N . S. Rubashov arrested . Pass it along . p. 6 202 Rubashov ? Well , well ! Crosses to other wall , taps.N . S. Rubashov arrested . Pass it along . The tiers of cells darken and vanish , leaving only RUBASHOV visible , leaning against the wall , staring into space . The taps echo and reecho throughout the prison , to the whispering accompaniment : " N. S. Rubashov arrested ! N. S. Rubashov arrested ! " The whispers grow into the roar of a mighty throng calling out , " Rubashov ! Rubashov ! " RUBASHOV 's voice is heard , young and triumphant , addressing the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , and sailors of the Revolution . The great , terrible , and joyful day has arrived ! The crowd roars . RUBASHOV , listening to the past , head bowed , paces his cell slowly.Eight months ago the chariot of the blood-stained and mire-bespattered Romanov monarchy was tilted over at one blow . The oceanic roar of the crowd.The gray , stuttering Provisional Government of bourgeois democracy which followed was already dead and only waiting for the broom of History to sweep its putrid corpse into the sewer . In the name of the Revolutionary Committee , I now declare the Provisional Government overthrown . The roar swells.Power to the Soviets ! Land to the peasants ! Bread to the hungry ! Peace to all the peoples ! The victorious shouts of " Rubashov ! Rubashov ! " mount to a crescendo , fade away and die , leaving only the blanketed stillness of the cell and RUBASHOV listening to his memories . Three taps from 402 's wall arouse him . He responds , ear to the wall . The wall dissolves , revealing 402. p. 7 402 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Taps.Who are you ? 402 taps:None of your damned business . RUBASHOV taps:As you like . 402 taps:Long live His Majesty , the Tsar ! RUBASHOV So that 's it . Taps.I thought you birds extinct . 402 beats out the rhythm with his shoe:Long live the Tsar ! RUBASHOV grins sardonically , taps:Amen ! Amen ! 402 taps:Swine ! RUBASHOV amused , taps out:Did n't quite understand . 402 in a frenzy , hammers out:Dirty swine RUBASHOV taps:Not interested in your family tree . 402 fury suddenly passes , taps out slowly:Why have you been locked up ? p. 8 RUBASHOV taps : I do n't know . Pause . 402 taps:Anything happened ? Big ? Assassination ? War ? RUBASHOV taps: No . Can you lend me tobacco ? 402 taps:For you ? I 'd be castrated first . RUBASHOV taps:Good idea . 402 walks away , lies down on his cot . The lights fade out on him . RUBASHOV paces his cell , counting out the steps:1-2-3-4-5- and a half He wheels back.1-2-3-4 Strange ghostly voices are dimly heard.It starts . So soon . The vague outlines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other ghostly faces appear in space.Yes , you sailors of Kronstadt  --  I shall pay . And you nameless ones . The face of a little hunchback appears , smoking a pipe and smiling.And Comrade Luigi . Some plates appear dancing in space  --  then a big moonface of a man , juggling them , grinning.And Pablo . The luminous face of a young woman appears in space . A striking face ; large , soft brown eyes ; dark hair ; white skin.And Luba . The voices and faces fade away.My debts will be paid  --  my debts will be paid . The young woman materializes . The cell becomes the office of the Commissar of the Iron Works . Huge graphs hang on the walls . Through the window , a vista of factory chimneys and the skeletons of incompleted building may be seen . The young woman is bent over her notebook , taking down dictation . RUBASHOV walks up and down , dictating . In the pauses , she raises her head , and her soft , round eyes follow his wanderings through the room . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She wears a white peasant blouse , embroidered with little flowers at the high neck . Her body is generously formed and voluptuous. p. 9 RUBASHOV dictates : " To meet the Five-Year Plan we must step up our tempo . A twelve-hour day if necessary . Tempo ! Tempo ! " The girl tosses her head as she writes , and her dangling earrings attract his attention . He frowns . Her head buried in her notebook , she does not observe this . " The Unions will dismiss workers who come late and deprive all laggards of their food cards " She quickly reaches down to scratch her ankle , and he notices she is wearing high-heeled slippers . He frowns again . " In the building of a new , hitherto undreamt-of Communist state , we must be guided by one rule , dash , the end justifies the means , period . Relentlessly , exclamation point . " The girl bobs her head , the earrings sway . He suddenly growls:Why do you wear those earrings ? And those high heels ? With a peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? LUBA Loshenko . RUBASHOV Loshenko ? LUBA Yes , Comrade Commissar . Luba Loshenko . Her voice is low and hoarse , but gentle . RUBASHOV And how long have you been working here ? LUBA For you , Comrade Commissar ? p. 10 RUBASHOV growls:Yes , for me . Of course , for me . LUBA Three weeks . RUBASHOV Three ? Really ? Well , Comrade Loshenko , do n't dress up like a ceremonial elephant in the office ! LUBA Yes , Comrade Commissar , I 'm sorry . RUBASHOV You were n't wearing those earrings yesterday ? LUBA No , Comrade Commissar , I was n't . RUBASHOV Then what are you getting dressed up for now ? What 's the occasion ? This is an office . We 've work to do . Ridiculous . Where was I ? LUBA glances at her notebook : " The end justifies the means , period . Relentlessly , exclamation point . " RUBASHOV Mm ! He picks up some papers from the desk , glances at them . " You liberals sitting on a cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at her ; she is watching him but quickly turns back to her notebook.You  --  you 've really very pretty little ears . Why do you ruin them with those survivals of barbaric culture ? She plucks off the earrings.That 's better . And do n't look so frightened . I 'm not going to eat you . What do you people in the office think I am ? An ogre ? I do n't eat little children . p. 11 LUBA looks at him: I 'm not frightened . RUBASHOV You 're not ? LUBA No . RUBASHOV surprised:Humph ! Good ! Good ! Where was I ? LUBA scans her notebook : " Sitting on a cloud , dangling your feet in the air . " RUBASHOV Ah ! She looks up at him and smiles . In spite of himself , he returns her smile.Yes Then soberly again . " You liberals are wrong . " He begins to pace . " And those who are wrong will pay ! " The image of the girl fades ; the office vanishes , and he is back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay my debt to you , above all . Three taps are heard from 402 's wall . He turns to the wall , fiercely.But not you . I owe you nothing . How many of your people have I killed ? No matter . You taught us to hate . Three taps from 402 . You stood over us with the knout and the hangman . Three taps from 402 . Your police made us fear this world , your priests the next , you poured melted lead down our throats , you massacred us in Moscow , you slit the bellies of our partisans in Siberia and stuffed them with grain . No ! Crossing to the wall.You ? I owe no debt to you . Three taps from 402 . RUBASHOV places his ear to the wall , taps curtly.What do you want ? p. 12 402 appears , tapping:I 'm sending tobacco . RUBASHOV after a long pause , taps:Thanks . Sighs , murmurs to the wall.Do I owe you a debt too ? We at least acted in the name of humanity . Mm . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , cynically.What is this , Rubashov ? A breath of religious madness ? A feverish chill shakes him . He puts on his coat . 402 rattles his door , peers through the judas hole , calls:Guard ! Guard ! The GUARD is heard shuffling across the corridor . GUARD through the bars of the judas hole:What do you want ? 402 Could you take this tobacco to cell 400 ? GUARD No. 402 I 'll give you a hundred rubles . GUARD I 'll give you my butt in your face . 402 walks away:For two rubles he 'd cut his mother 's throat . GUARD returns to the judas hole , menacingly:What did you say ? p. 13 402 cringes , whining:Nothing ! I said nothing . The GUARD shuffles off . 402 crosses to wall , taps.You 're in for it . RUBASHOV on sudden impulse goes to the iron door of his cell , bangs on it , shouting:Guard ! Guard ! The GUARD is heard approaching down the corridor . GUARD Quiet ! You 're waking everyone . His shadow appears in the judas hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . GUARD cackles:Oh , sure . RUBASHOV At once ! GUARD Who do you think you are ? RUBASHOV Read your Party history . GUARD I know who you are . RUBASHOV Then do n't ask idiotic questions . GUARD You 're Number 400 , in solitary , and you 're probably going to be taken down in the cellar and shot . Now do n't give me any more trouble or you 'll get a butt in your face . RUBASHOV You try it and we 'll see who 'll be shot . The GUARD hesitates . RUBASHOV again hammers on the door . p. 14 GUARD You 're waking everyone . Stop that or I 'll report you . RUBASHOV Do so ! Report me ! At once ! GUARD I will . He goes . RUBASHOV continues to hammer on the cell door . The lights come up in the cell tier , bringing the other prisoners into vision . They have been listening to this exchange through the judas hole . 302 turns from the door and seats himself on his cot . Slowly , painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on his cot , responds , and listens . 302 taps:Outside ? 402 taps:It 's morning , four A.M. , Tuesday . March . Snowing . 302 taps:Send Rubashov my greetings . 402 taps:Who shall I say ? 302 taps:Just say an old friend . 402 crosses to Rubashov , summons him with a tap . RUBASHOV rises and listens at the wall as 402 taps:302 sends greetings . RUBASHOV taps : What 's his name ? p. 15 402 taps:Wo n't say . Just old friend . He was tortured last week . RUBASHOV taps: Why ? 402 taps:Political divergencies . RUBASHOV taps : Your kind ? 402 taps: No , your kind . RUBASHOV taps:How many prisoners here ? 402 taps:Thousands . Come and go . RUBASHOV taps : Your kind ? 402 taps: No . Yours . I 'm extinct . Ha ! Ha ! RUBASHOV taps:Ha ! Ha ! Footsteps approaching ring out in the corridor . He taps quickly.Someone 's coming . 402 vanishes . RUBASHOV throws himself on the cot . A huge young man in an officer 's uniform enters . His shaven head , his deep-set , expressionless eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death's-head . His stiff uniform creaks , as do his boots . The officer who arrested RUBASHOV and the GUARD are visible in the doorway . The young man enters the cell , which becomes smaller through his presence . His name is GLETKIN. p. 16 GLETKIN fixes RUBASHOV with a cold stare:Were you the one banging on the door ? He looks about.This cell needs cleaning . To RUBASHOV.You know the regulations ? He glances behind the door , turns to the GUARD.He has no mop . Get him a mop ! The GUARD hurries off . RUBASHOV Are you the commandant here ? GLETKIN No . Why were you banging on the door ? RUBASHOV Why am I under arrest ? Why have I been dragged out of a sickbed ? Why have I been brought here ? GLETKIN If you wish to argue with me you 'll have to stand up . RUBASHOV If you 're not the commandant , I have n't the slightest desire to argue with you or even to speak to you for that matter . GLETKIN Then do n't bang on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be applied . Turns to the ARRESTING OFFICER.When was the prisoner brought in ? ARRESTING OFFICER Ten minutes ago . GLETKIN glances at his watch , sternly:His arrest was ordered for three A.M. sharp . What happened ? p. 17 ARRESTING OFFICER The car broke down . GLETKIN That 's inexcusable . It 's the commandant 's new car , and it was in perfect condition . This looks very suspicious . He takes out a notebook and writes in it.Send the driver up to my office at once ! RUBASHOV It 's not his fault . It was n't sabotage . GLETKIN writes , without glancing up:How do you know it was n't ? RUBASHOV Make allowances . GLETKIN For what ? RUBASHOV Our roads . GLETKIN puts away the notebook and measures RUBASHOV impersonally:What 's the matter with our roads ? RUBASHOV They 're primitive cow paths . GLETKIN Very critical , are n't we ? I suppose the roads in the bourgeois countries are better ? RUBASHOV looks at GLETKIN , smiles cynically:Young man , have you ever been outside of our country ? GLETKIN No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to hear any fairy tales . RUBASHOV Fairy tales ? Sits up.Have you read any of my books or articles ? p. 18 GLETKIN In the Komsomol Youth I read your political-education pamphlets . In their time I found them useful . RUBASHOV How flattering ! And did you find any fairy tales in them ? GLETKIN That was fifteen years ago . Pause.Do n't think that gives you any privileges now ! The GUARD appears , flapping a dirty rag . GLETKIN takes it , throws it at RUBASHOV 's feet.When the morning bugle blows , you will clean up your cell . You know the rules . You 've been in prison before ? RUBASHOV Yes . Many of them . But this is my first experience under my own people . He rubs his inflamed jaw . GLETKIN Do you wish to go on sick call ? RUBASHOV No , thanks . I know prison doctors . GLETKIN Then you 're not really sick ? RUBASHOV I have an abscess . It 'll burst itself . GLETKIN without irony:Have you any more requests ? RUBASHOV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stop wasting my time ! GLETKIN Your time has run out , Rubashov ! He starts to go , pulling the door behind him . p. 19 RUBASHOV murmurs in French : Plus un singe monte GLETKIN reenters quickly:Speak in your own tongue ! Are you so gone you ca n't even think any longer except in a filthy , foreign language ? RUBASHOV sharply , with military authority:Young man , there 's nothing wrong with the French language as such . Now , tell them I 'm here and let 's have a little Bolshevik discipline ! GLETKIN stiffens , studies RUBASHOV coldly , turns and goes , slamming the iron door . The jangle of the key in the lock ; his footsteps as he marches off down the corridor . Suddenly RUBASHOV bounds to the door . He shouts through the judas hole.And get me some cigarettes ! Damn you ! Rubs his inflamed cheek , ruefully . To himself.Now , why did you do that , Rubashov ? What does this young man think of you ? " Worn-out old intellectual ! Self-appointed Messiah ! Dares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There you go again , Rubashov  --  the old disease . Paces.4 5 . Revolutionaries should n't see through other people 's eyes . Or should they ? How can you change the world if you identify yourself with everybody ? How else can you change it ? Paces.3 4 . He pauses , frowning , searching his memory.What is it about this young man ? Something ? Paces.3 4 . Why do I recall a religious painting ? A Piet , a dead Christ in Mary 's arms ? Of course  --  Germany . The Museum , Leipzig , 1933 . Slowly the prison becomes a museum in Germany . A large painting of the Piet materializes . An S.S. OFFICER in black uniform and swastika armband is staring at the Piet . His face , though different from GLETKIN 'S in features , has the same , cold , fanatical expression . RUBASHOV , catalogue in hand , walks slowly down , studying a row of invisible paintings front ; then he crosses over , studies the Piet . The S.S. OFFICER glances at him with hard , searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive face , sunken cheeks , enters , looks alternately at the catalogue he is holding and the paintings in space . He halts next to RUBASHOV , squinting to make out the title . p. 20 RICHARD softly , reading : Christ Crowned with Thorns . RUBASHOV turns , front , nods:Titian . RICHARD to RUBASHOV:What page is it in your catalogue , please ? RUBASHOV without looking at him , hands over his catalogue . MAN glances at it , looks about hurriedly , returns it , whispers hoarsely.Be very careful . They 're everywhere . RUBASHOV I know . You 're late , Comrade Richard . RICHARD I went a roundabout way . RUBASHOV Give me your report . RICHARD It 's bad . RUBASHOV Give it to me . RICHARD Since the Reichstag fire , they 've turned the tables on us . It 's a massacre . All Germany is a shambles . Two weeks ago we had six hundred and twelve cells here  --  today there are fifty-two left . The Party is a thousand-headed mass of bleeding flesh . Two of my group jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest ! His lips start to tremble ; his entire body is suddenly convulsed . RUBASHOV sharply:Control yourself ! Glances about.You 're one of the leaders here . If you go on this way , what can we expect of the other comrades ? p. 21 RICHARD controls himself with an effort:I 'm sorry . RUBASHOV For a man who has written such heroic plays of the proletariat , this is surprising . RICHARD This is a bad moment for me . My wife , Comrade Truda , was arrested two days ago . The Storm Troopers took her and I have n't heard since . RUBASHOV Where were you at the time ? RICHARD Across the street , on a roof . His voice becomes shrill as he begins to lose control again . A stutter creeps into his speech.I w-w-watched them take her away . RUBASHOV glances around to see if they are observed , motions Richard to the bench under the Piet:Sit down . They both sit on the bench.We have a big job here . We have to pull the Party together . We have to stiffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD We carry on , Comrade . We work day and night . We distribute literature in the factories and house to house . RUBASHOV I 've seen some of these pamphlets . Who wrote them ? RICHARD I did . RUBASHOV You did ? p. 22 RICHARD Yes . Why ? RUBASHOV They 're not quite satisfactory , Comrade Richard . RICHARD In what respect ? RUBASHOV A bit off the line . We sense a certain sympathy with the Liberals and the Social Democrats . RICHARD The Storm Troopers are The stammer again creeps into his speech.Sl sl slaughtering them , too , like animals in the street . RUBASHOV Let them ! How does that affect us ? In that respect the Nazis are clearing the way for us by wiping out this trash and saving us the trouble . RICHARD Trash ? RUBASHOV The Liberals are our most treacherous enemies . Historically , they have always betrayed us . RICHARD But that 's inhuman , man . You comrades back there act as if nothing had happened here . Try and understand ! We 're living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call ourselves " dead men on ho holiday . " RUBASHOV The party leadership here carries a great responsibility , and those who go soft now are betraying it . You 're playing into the enemies ' hands ! RICHARD I ? p. 23 RUBASHOV Yes , Comrade Richard , you . RICHARD What is this ? I supposed Truda betrayed the Party , too ? RUBASHOV If you go on this way Suddenly , urgently.Speak quietly , and do n't turn your head to the door ! A tall young man in the uniform of a Storm Trooper has entered the room with a girl , and they stand nearby , studying their catalogues and the pictures . The S.S. OFFICER whispers to the girl . She titters . RUBASHOV rises . In a low calm voice.Go on talking . RICHARD rises , glances at his catalogue , talking rapidly:Roger van der Weyden , the elder , 1400 to 1464 . He 's probably van Eyck 's most famous pupil . RUBASHOV His figures are somewhat angular . RICHARD Yes , but look at the heads . There 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again the stammer.Compare h h him with the other masters ; you 'll see his coloring is softer and l l lighter . His eyes stray to the S.S. OFFICER in panic and hatred . RUBASHOV Did you stammer as a child ? Sharply.Do n't look over there ! p. 24 RICHARD looks away quickly:S sometimes . RUBASHOV Breathe slowly and deeply several times . RICHARD obeys . The GIRL with the STORM TROOPER giggles shrilly , and the pair move slowly toward the exit . In passing , they both turn their heads toward RICHARD and RUBASHOV . The STORM TROOPER says something to the girl . She replies in a low voice . They leave , the girl 's giggling audible as their foot-steps recede . RICHARD softly , to himself:Truda used to laugh at my stutter . She had a funny little laugh . RUBASHOV motioning RICHARD to reseat himself:You must give me your promise to write only according to the lines laid down by the Comintern . RICHARD sitting:Understand one thing , Comrade : Some of my colleagues write easily . I do n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel in here . I have no choice  --  I write what I must , because I must . Even if I 'm wrong , I must write what I believe . That 's how we arrive at the truth . RUBASHOV We have already arrived at the truth . Objective truth . And with us , Art is its weapon . I 'm amazed at you , Comrade Richard . You 're seeking the truth for the sake of your own ego ! What kind of delusion is this ? The individual is nothing ! The Party is everything ! And its policy as laid down by the Comintern must be like a block of polished granite . One conflicting idea is dangerous . Not one crack in its surface is to be tolerated . Nothing ! Not a mustard seed must be allowed to sprout in it and split our solidarity ! The " me , " the " I , " is a grammatical fiction . He takes out his watch , glances at it.My time is up . He puts his watch back in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the line . We will send you further instructions . p. 25 RICHARD rises: I do n't think I can do it . RUBASHOV Why not ? RICHARD I do n't believe in their policy . RUBASHOV Against our enemies , we 're implacable ! RICHARD That means ? RUBASHOV You know what it means . RICHARD You 'd t turn me over to the Nazis ? RUBASHOV Those who are not with us are against us . RICHARD Then what 's the difference between us and them ? Our people here are going over to them by the tens of thousands . It 's an easy step . Too easy . A pause . He speaks almost inaudibly.Who can say what your Revolution once meant to me ? The end of all injustice . Paradise ! And my Truda now lies bleeding in some S.S. cellar . She may be dead even now . Yes . In my heart  --  I know she 's dead . RUBASHOV buttons his coat:We 'll have to break this off now . We 'd better go separately . You leave first , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are none . There 's nothing more to be said . p. 26 RICHARD And that 's all ? RUBASHOV Yes , that 's all ! Walks off into the shadows . RICHARD groans:Christ ! RICHARD , the Piet , and the Museum vanish , leaving RUBASHOV alone , pacing his cell . A tap from 402 brings him across to 402 's wall . RUBASHOV taps three times . 402 becomes visible , tapping:I 've a very important question . RUBASHOV taps : What ? 402 taps:Promise answer ? RUBASHOV taps : Your question ? 402 taps:When did you last sleep with a woman ? RUBASHOV groans , after a long pause , laughs sardonically:Now what would you like ? Taps.Three weeks ago . 402 taps:Tell me about it . RUBASHOV Ach ! Turns away . 402 taps:Tell me ! Tell me ! What were her breasts like ? p. 27 RUBASHOV to the wall:I suppose I have to humor you . He taps.Snowy , fitting into champagne glasses . Murmurs to the wall.Is that your style ? 402 taps:Go on . Details . Her thighs . RUBASHOV taps:Thighs like wild mares . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ! More ! RUBASHOV taps:That 's all . You idiot  --  I 'm teasing you . 402 taps:Go on , go on . Details , please . Suddenly the joke goes stale . RUBASHOV 's face clouds as a haunting memory rises to torment him . Soft strains of distant music are heard . His hand brushes his face as if to wipe away the memory . RUBASHOV taps: No more . 402 taps:Go on , please . Please ! RUBASHOV to himself:No more . No more . He lies down on his cot , throws his coat over him , brooding . The music rises . p. 28 402 taps:Please ! On his knees , pleading . Please ! Moans and taps . Please ! He buries his head in his cot , pleading inaudibly as the lights fade out on him . The lights in RUBASHOV 's cell dim . The music swells to the strains of a piano recording of Beethoven 's " Appassionata . " As the lights come up , the cell dissolves and becomes LUBA LOSHENKO 's bedroom . RUBASHOV 's cot becomes part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , LUBA , clad only in her chemise , sits smoking , dreamily staring into space , listening to the music that is coming from a small gramophone on the table nearby . LUBA So tomorrow I 'll have a new boss . RUBASHOV Yes . LUBA I 'll hate him . RUBASHOV No . He 'll be all right . They listen in silence . He smiles , musing.This music is dangerous . LUBA You 'll be gone long ? RUBASHOV I do n't know . LUBA I 'll miss you terribly . She hums the melody of the music . RUBASHOV taking out a cigarette:Get me a match , will you , Luba ? p. 29 LUBA smiles , rises , walks to the table , picks up some matches , crosses to him , swaying to the music:I love this . It always makes me feel like crying . She lights his cigarette . RUBASHOV smiling:Do you enjoy that ? LUBA Crying ? She blows out the match , laughs.Sometimes . RUBASHOV Our racial weakness . LUBA What ? RUBASHOV Tears and mysticism LUBA You mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUBA I believe in it . RUBASHOV I know you do . LUBA Petty bourgeois ? RUBASHOV Yes , Luba , you are . He looks at her fondly , leans over , pulls her to him , kisses her throat . The music rises.This music is dangerous . They listen in silence awhile . She goes to the gramophone and winds it . She leans against the wall near RUBASHOV . LUBA When I was a little girl in the Pioneer Youth I would start crying at the most unexpected moments . p. 30 RUBASHOV You ? In the Pioneer Youth ? You , Luba ? LUBA You 're surprised ? I was n't in very long . I was n't good material . RUBASHOV smiles.I would cry suddenly for no reason at all . RUBASHOV But there was a reason ? LUBA I do n't know . She smokes for a moment.Yes , I do . Our primer books made little Pavelik such a hero . All of us children wanted to turn our mothers and fathers over to the G.P.U . to be shot . RUBASHOV Was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . But I would picture myself doing it any-way and becoming a great national hero like Pavelik . Then I would burst out crying . I loved my parents very much . Of course , no one knew why I was crying . So I was expelled , and my political career ended at the age of nine ! RUBASHOV smiles . LUBA hums the melody.My father loved this . He and mother used to play it over and over and over . RUBASHOV Where are they now ? LUBA They died in the famine after the Revolution . My father was a doctor . RUBASHOV Have you any family left ? p. 31 LUBA One brother . He 's a doctor , too . He 's married . My sister-in-law is very nice . She 's a Polish woman an artist . LUBA picks up a small painting , crosses to RUBASHOV , kneels at his side.She painted this picture . It 's their baby . A little boy . Two years old . Is n't he fat ? RUBASHOV studies it:Yes , he is fat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get married , Luba , and have some fat babies of your own ? Is n't there a young man at the office ? LUBA Yes . RUBASHOV I thought so . And he wants to marry you ? LUBA rests her cheek on his knee , lovingly caresses his hand:Yes , he does . RUBASHOV Well ? LUBA No ! RUBASHOV Why not ? LUBA I do n't love him . RUBASHOV Mm , I see , I see . A pause . LUBA suddenly:You can do anything you wish with me . RUBASHOV studies her:Why did you say that ? LUBA shrugs her shoulders.You do n't reproach me ? p. 32 LUBA Oh , no , no , no ! Why should I ? The music swells and fills the room . RUBASHOV This music is dangerous . When you listen to this and you realize human beings can create such beauty , you want to pat them on the head . That 's bad . They 'll only bite your hand off . LUBA takes his hand , and kisses it:Like this ? RUBASHOV gently:Luba , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LUBA I do n't expect anything more . Did I give you the impression I expected anything more ? RUBASHOV No . You 've been very kind , Luba , and sweet . Pause.I may be gone a long time . I may never see you again . LUBA Where are you going ? RUBASHOV hands her the painting:Wherever the Party sends me . LUBA rises: I understand . I 'm not asking anything . Only , wherever you go , I 'll be thinking of you . I 'll be with you in my mind always ! RUBASHOV snuffs out cigarette:But this is exactly what I do n't want . p. 33 LUBA turns toward him:You do n't ? RUBASHOV No , Luba , no ! LUBA quietly:Oh ! She crosses slowly to the gramophone . Suddenly , the phantasmagoria of LUBA and the bedroom vanishes as the lights are switched on in the cell . The jangle of the key in the lock . The door flies open . A young GUARD enters . GUARD All right ! Get up . Come with me . RUBASHOV Are you taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do as you 're told . RUBASHOV Very well . Rises.All the posters show our young people smiling . He puts on his overcoat.Have you ever smiled ? GUARD humorlessly:Yes . RUBASHOV Wonderful ! When ? On what occasion , short of an execution ? The GUARD grimly motions him out . They go . The light is switched off in his cell , as the lights come up on the prison tier . 402 crosses to 302 's wall and taps: They 've taken him up . p. 34 302 taps:So soon ? 402 taps:Pass it on . 302 taps: They 've taken Rubashov up . Pass it on . 202 taps : I hope they give him a bad time . 302 taps:Oh , no ! He was friend of the people . 202 taps:Yes . His eyes bulge wildly as he addresses an imaginary group about him.They 're all friends of the people . Did n't they free us ? Look at us . Free as birds ! Everything 's all right , Comrades . The land belongs to us ! But the bread belongs to them . The rivers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ours , but not the wood ! That 's for them . Everything 's for them . He crosses , taps.They 've taken Rubashov up ! Pass it on ! The taps echo and reecho throughout the prison : " Rubashov taken up , " " Rubashov taken up . " The lights dim and the prisoners in the honeycomb of cells vanish behind the scrim , leaving only a huge pillar of granite and iron shrouded in shadows . The lights come up on an office in the prison . A barred window reveals dawn , and snow falling , outside . The bayonet of a guard cuts back and forth across the window like a metronome . On the wall , over the desk , is a portrait of The Leader seen vaguely in shadow . The rest of the wall is empty except for faded patches where other pictures have been hung and removed . Seated at the desk , smoking a long Kremlin cigarette , is a middle-aged man in officer 's uniform . He is rough , heavy-set , jowly , graying at the temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is grimly examining some papers , carelessly dribbling cigarette ashes over his jacket . There is a knock at the door . The officer , IVANOFF , calls out , " Come in . " The GUARD enters with RUBASHOV. p. 35 IVANOFF gruffly , to the GUARD:Shut the door . Exit the GUARD . IVANOFF rises , shakes his head at RUBASHOV , laughs , then familiarly:Kolya ! RUBASHOV Well ! IVANOFF Surprised ? RUBASHOV Nothing surprises me any more . IVANOFF laughs , opens a drawer , takes out a box of cigarettes , limps across the room to him.Are you the commandant here ? IVANOFF shaking his head: I 'm your investigator . RUBASHOV That makes it difficult . IVANOFF Not at all . Not if we 're intelligent which we are . Offers him the box of cigarettes.Cigarette ? RUBASHOV pauses . RUBASHOV Have hostilities begun yet ? IVANOFF Why ? RUBASHOV You know the etiquette . IVANOFF Take one ! Forces the box into his hand.Put them in your pocket , keep them . RUBASHOV All right . He takes a cigarette , and puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude . p. 36 IVANOFF Why so aggressive ? RUBASHOV Did I arrest you ? Or did you people arrest me ? IVANOFF You people ? Shakes his head , lights his own cigarette.What 's happened to you , Kolya ? What a falling-off is here ! Sighs.Ekh ! Ekh ! RUBASHOV Why have I been arrested ? IVANOFF gives RUBASHOV a match , genially:Later . Sit down . Light your cigarette . Relax . He limps to the door , closes the judas hole , and locks it . RUBASHOV sits down. I saw you last three years ago . RUBASHOV smoking his cigarette with relish:Where ? IVANOFF Moscow . As he talks , he crosses up to the window and pulls the chain , letting down the iron shutters.You were speaking . You 'd just escaped from the German prison . They gave you a bad time , did n't they ? They did n't dull your edge , though . Crosses back to RUBASHOV.Good speech , plenty of bite . I was proud of my old General . RUBASHOV Why did n't you come backstage ? IVANOFF You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drily:Mm , a fine assortment of opportunists , bureaucrats , and variegated pimps . IVANOFF grins , shakes his head , hobbles to his desk . RUBASHOV points to his leg.Your leg 's very good . I had n't even noticed . IVANOFF nods , smiles , sits on the desk , tapping his leg:Automatic joints , rustless chromium plating . I can swim , ride , drive a car , dance , make love . You see how right you were ? And how stupid I was . RUBASHOV You were young and emotional , that 's all . Tell me , Sascha , does the amputated foot still itch ? IVANOFF laughs:The big toe . In rainy weather . RUBASHOV smoking:Curious . IVANOFF lowers his lids , squints at RUBASHOV , blows a smoke ring:Not at all . Does n't your recent amputation itch ? RUBASHOV Mine ? IVANOFF calmly , blowing smoke rings:When did you cut yourself off from the Party ? How long have you been a member of the organized opposition ? RUBASHOV throws his cigarette away , grinds it out under his foot:The unofficial part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him:Do n't be so aggressive , Nicolai ! RUBASHOV takes off his glasses , rubs his eyes:I 'm tired , and I 'm sick , and I do n't care to play any games with you . Why have I been arrested ? IVANOFF cynically , crossing back to his desk chair:Supposing you tell me why . RUBASHOV bounds to his feet , furious:Stop this nonsense now ! Who do you think you 're dealing with ? What are the charges against me ? IVANOFF shrugs his shoulders , leans back in his chair:What difference does that make ? RUBASHOV I demand that you either read the charges  --  or dismiss me at once ! IVANOFF blows a smoke ring:Let 's be sensible , shall we ? Legal subtleties are all right for others , but for the likes of you and myself ? He taps his cigarette ash off into the tray.Why put on an act ? When did you ever trouble about formal charges ? At Kronstadt ? He rises , confronts RUBASHOV.After all  --  remember  --  I served under you . I know you . p. 39 RUBASHOV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't win battles with rose water and silk gloves . IVANOFF Not our kind of battles , no ! RUBASHOV heatedly:A bloodless revolution is a contradiction in terms . Illegality and violence are like dynamite in the hands of a true revolutionary  --  weapons of the class struggle . IVANOFF Agreed . RUBASHOV But you people have used the weapons of the Revolution to strangulate the Revolution ! You 've turned the Terror againstthe people . You 've begun the bloodbath of the Thermidor . He controls himself , speaks quietly.And that 's something quite different , my one-time friend and comrade . Sits . IVANOFF Damn it , Kolya , I 'd hate to see you shot . RUBASHOV polishing his glasses , smiles sarcastically:Very touching of you . And exactly why do you people wish to shoot me ? IVANOFF flares up : " You people ! " Again . What the hell 's happened to you ? It used to be " we . " RUBASHOV on his feet again:Yes , it used to be . But who is the " we " today ? He points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his machine ? Who is the " we " ? Tell me. p. 40 IVANOFF The people , the masses RUBASHOV Leave the masses out . You do n't understand them any more . Probably I do n't either . Once we worked with them . We knew them . We made history with them . We were part of them . For one little minute we started them on what promised to be a new run of dignity for man . But that 's gone ! Dead ! And buried . There they are . He indicates the faded patches of wallpaper.Faded patches on the wall . The old guard . Our old comrades . Where are they ? Slaughtered ! Your pockmarked leader has picked us off one by one till no one 's left except a few broken-down men like myself , and a few careerist prostitutes like you ! IVANOFF And when did you arrive at this morbid conclusion ? RUBASHOV I did n't arrive at it . It was thrust on me . IVANOFF When ? On what occasion would you say ? RUBASHOV On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I looked about for my old friends , when all I could find of them were those  --  Again he waves his spectacles at the telltale patches .  --  faded patches on every wall in every house in the land . IVANOFF nods his head , murmurs reasonably:Mm , hm ! I see . That 's logical . And that , of course , was when you The telephone rings . IVANOFF picks up the receiver , barks.I 'm busy . Hangs up.When you joined the organized opposition p. 41 RUBASHOV slowly , deliberately:You know as well as I do , I never joined the organized opposition . IVANOFF Kolya ! Please ! We both grew up in the tradition . RUBASHOV sharply:I never joined the opposition . IVANOFF Why not ? You mean you sat by with your arms folded ? You thought we were leading the Revolution to destruction and you did nothing ? Shakes his head . RUBASHOV Perhaps I was too old and used up . IVANOFF sits back again , clucks with good-natured disbelief:Ekh , ekh , ekh ! RUBASHOV shrugging his shoulders:Believe what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the proofs . RUBASHOV Proofs of what ? Sabotage ? IVANOFF That , of course . RUBASHOV Of course . IVANOFF If that were all . RUBASHOV There 's more ? IVANOFF nods:And worse . Rises.Attempted murder . p. 42 RUBASHOV Ah ! And who am I supposed to have attempted to murder ? IVANOFF Not personally . You instigated the act . Naturally . RUBASHOV Naturally . IVANOFF I told you we have proofs . Picks up a sheaf of typewritten pages and waves them under his nose . RUBASHOV For instance ? IVANOFF Confessions . RUBASHOV Whose ? IVANOFF For one , the man who was to do the killing . RUBASHOV Congratulations . And who was it I instigated to murder whom ? IVANOFF Indiscreet question . RUBASHOV May I read the confession ? RUBASHOV reaches out for the papers . IVANOFF smiles , draws them out of his reach.May I be confronted with the man ? IVANOFF smiles again , shakes his head.Who the hell would I want to murder ? IVANOFF You 've been sitting there for ten minutes telling me . He opens a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to murder is the Leader . He slams the drawer shut.Our Leader . p. 43 RUBASHOV takes off his glasses , leans forward , speaks deliberately , between his teeth:Do you really believe this nonsense ? He studies IVANOFF.Or are you only pretending to be an idiot ? He suddenly laughs knowingly.You do n't believe it . IVANOFF sits slowly , adjusting his prosthetic leg:Put yourself in my place . Our positions could very easily be reversed . Ask yourself that question  --  and you have the answer . IVANOFF rubs his thigh at the amputation line , stares moodily at the false leg.I was always so proud of my body . Then to wake , to find a stump in a wire cage . I can smell that hospital room . I can see it as if it were happening now : you sitting there by my bed , soothing , reasoning , scolding , and I crying because they had just amputated my leg . He turns to RUBASHOV.Remember how I begged you to lend me your pistol ? Remember how you argued with me for three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romanticism ? He rises , his voice suddenly harsh.Today the positions are reversed . Now it 's you who want to throw yourself into the abyss . Well , I 'm not going to let you . Then we 'll be quits . RUBASHOV putting on his glasses , studies IVANOFF for a second , with an ironic smile:You want to save me ? You 've a damned curious way of doing it . I am unimpressed by your bogus sentimentality . You 've already tricked me into talking my head off my shoulders . Let it go at that ! p. 44 IVANOFF beams:I had to make you explode now , or you 'd have exploded at the wrong time . Have n't you even noticed ? Gestures about the room.No stenographer ! He crosses back to his desk , opens a drawer.You 're behaving like an infant . A romantic infant . Now you know what we 're going to do ? Extracts a dossier from the drawer . RUBASHOV grimly:No , what are we going to do ? IVANOFF We are going to concoct a nice little confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUBASHOV nods his head in amused comprehension:So that 's it ? There 's to be a public trial ? And I 'm to make a nice little confession ? IVANOFF Let me finish . RUBASHOV biting out each word:That is to say , I 'm to transform myself into a grinning chimpanzee in a zoo ? I 'm to beat my breast and spit at myself in a mirror , so the People can laugh and say , " The Old Guard  --  how ridiculous ! " I 'm to pick at my own excrement and put it in my own mouth , so the People can say , " The Old Guard  --  how disgusting ! " No , Sascha , no ! You 've got the wrong man . p. 45 IVANOFF drawling with exaggerated patience:Let me finish . The patience vanishes . He shouts at RUBASHOV.Which are we to save ? Your dignity or your head ? He controls his impatience , begins to talk rapidly , thinking out the plan in his own mind , as he paces to and fro.You make this confession now . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloc . You give us their names . ( They 've all been shot by now , anyway , so nothing 's lost . ) However , when you learned of their terroristic plans , you were shocked . You broke off with them . You see ? RUBASHOV Yes , I see . IVANOFF Your case then goes to public trial . We refute the murder charge completely . Even so , you 'll get twenty years . But in two , perhaps three years , a reprieve . In five years you 'll be back in the ring again . And that is all that matters . He stops and nods cheerfully at RUBASHOV . RUBASHOV No , I 'm sorry . IVANOFF his smile fades , he lights a fresh cigarette , speaks slowly , drily:Then your case will be taken out of my hands . You 'll be tried in secret session administratively . You know what that means ? RUBASHOV Yes . The rubber ball in my mouth , the bullet in the back of the neck . p. 46 IVANOFF shakes out the match , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically . You just disappear into thin air . As far as your followers are concerned , no demonstrations . How can they ? Perhaps you 're off on a mission ? Perhaps you 've run away ? Hidden somewhere ? Suspicious , of course . But what does that matter ? N. S. Rubashov has vanished . Pf ! Quietly ! Forever ! That 's your alternative . The phone rings . IVANOFF picks up the receiver.Look here , I 'm What ? Oh ! Yes ? Yes . I see . I 'll investigate at once . He hangs up , turns to RUBASHOV , chuckles , and nods his head.You fox ! Oh , you old fox ! He picks up the phone , presses a button . An answering voice responds.Gletkin ? Ivanoff . Come to my office at once ! The Rubashov arrest . You bungled it , that 's what . Yes . At once ! He hangs up . Turns again to RUBASHOV.Very adroit . RUBASHOV Really ? What have I done now ? IVANOFF You 've no idea ? RUBASHOV I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You overestimate them . GLETKIN enters , crosses above the desk , salutes stiffly . IVANOFF returns the salute . IVANOFF I have just received a phone call from the prosecutor 's office . Your men were instructed to arrest Citizen Rubashov as quietly as possible . What the hell went wrong ? p. 47 GLETKIN I 'm interrogating the arresting officers now . The prisoner refused them entrance and barricaded his door against them . IVANOFF So they shot off the lock ? RUBASHOV with mock indignation:Woke up the whole neighborhood . GLETKIN not glancing at him:There was no alternative . RUBASHOV over his shoulder to GLETKIN:There were five alternatives . You need some lessons in elementary tactics . Stung , GLETKIN turns toward RUBASHOV . IVANOFF quickly , commanding:Go on ! GLETKIN Then he refused to accompany them on his feet . They were forced to pick him up and carry him out bodily , screaming like a woman . RUBASHOV Wrong ! Roaring like a bear . A wounded bear . And they tore my pants . GLETKIN stands there , straight as a ramrod , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions were to treat him with care . You will see that the prisoner gets cigarettes and medical attention . RUBASHOV Not unless you furnish an outside physician . I know these prison doctors . p. 48 GLETKIN That is against regulations . IVANOFF to RUBASHOV:We 'll see what can be done . To GLETKIN.Wait out-side . Exit GLETKIN.You 'll be given every consideration . Pencil and paper , if you wish RUBASHOV Many thanks , but it wo n't work . I 've had my bellyful of this farce . He rises.Kindly have me taken to my cell . IVANOFF As you like . He picks up the phone , presses a button , and barks.Guard ! He hangs up. I did n't expect you to confess at once . Take your time . You have plenty of time . Think it over . When you are ready to confess , send me a note . The men stare at each other . IVANOFF smiles.You will . I 'm sure you will . RUBASHOV Never , Sascha . Never . That 's final ! The door is opened . The GUARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world in our era . Do n't you want to be here to see it ? RUBASHOV glances at IVANOFF , then turns and goes off with the GUARD . As soon as RUBASHOV leaves , IVANOFF drops his monumental calm , rises and calls out irritably , " Gletkin ! " As GLETKIN enters , IVANOFF speaks quickly and harshly , hobbling up and down nervously . p. 49 IVANOFF By now all Moscow knows . Make a full report . Send the arresting officers over to Headquarters . Indicates the chair.Sit down . GLETKIN sits.Now , look here ! I want it clearly understood . This is no ordinary prisoner . We ca n't afford any more bungling . When you handle this man you dance on eggs ! The political and historical importance of these trials is enormous . And N. S. Rubashov is the key figure . We must have his confession . Those are our orders . From the top . GLETKIN Then why not turn him over to me ? I 'll bring you his confession in three days . IVANOFF Thanks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in pieces ? Wonderful . No , your harsh methods wo n't work here . Not with this man . Lights a fresh cigarette , calms down.He 'll confess . There 's enough of the old Bolshevik left in him . He 'll confess . You 're to leave him in peace . I do n't want him disturbed . He 's to have paper , pencils , cigarettes , extra rations GLETKIN Why ? IVANOFF To accelerate the processes of thought . He has to work this out alone . Taps his head.In here . GLETKIN This approach , in my opinion , is all wrong . p. 50 IVANOFF looks at GLETKIN with veiled amusement:You do n't like him ? You had a little trouble with him a few minutes ago , did n't you ? GLETKIN That has nothing to do with it . IVANOFF Old Rubashov can still spit a sword ! What 'd he do ? Cut you up the middle ? GLETKIN coldly:His personality has nothing to do with it . I hope I 'm a better Party member than that . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IVANOFF Very commendable . GLETKIN Only , since this confession is so important to the Party , I consider your method wrong . This wo n't get you results . I know how to handle these old-timers . They 're all rotten at the core . They 're all infected with the Western leprosy . If you want a confession , turn him over to me . IVANOFF You young people amuse me . You know everything , do n't you ? The Nazis captured this man , broke his leg , smashed his jaw , killed him , and brought him to life again  --  I do n't know how many times  --  but they could n't extract one admission out of him . And finally , he escaped . And you 're going to break him for me in three days ? Musing.No ! If he confesses , it wo n't be out of cowardice . To GLETKIN.Your methods wo n't work with him . He 's made out of a material , the more you hammer it , the tougher it gets . p. 51 GLETKIN I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . The human nervous system at best can only stand so much  --  and when they have these bourgeois flaws in them , a little pressure  --  in the right places  --  and they split like rotten logs . IVANOFF laughs softly , shakes his head: I 'd hate to fall into your hands . GLETKIN It 's my experience that every human nervous system has a breaking point under pain . It 's only necessary to find the lever , the special pain IVANOFF abruptly and harshly:That 'll do ! GLETKIN rises stiffly:You asked me . IVANOFF pause : Comrade Gletkin , in the early days  --  He goes to his desk , opens a drawer , takes out a bottle and several glasses . He fills the glasses , pushes one over to GLETKIN.  --  before you were born , we started the Revolution with the illusion that some day we were going to abolish prisons and substitute flower gardens . Ekh , ekh ! Maybe , someday . He tosses off his drink . GLETKIN Why are you all so cynical ? IVANOFF Cynical ? Turns and surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather not , if you do n't mind . IVANOFF I do mind . Explain it . GLETKIN picks up the glass , drains it:I notice you older men always talk as if only the past were glorious or some distant future . But we 're already far ahead of any other country , here and now ! As for the past , we have to crush it . The quicker , the better . IVANOFF I see . He sits , shaking his head , amused.In your eyes , then , Iam the cynic ? GLETKIN Yes . I think so . He crosses to the table , sets down the glass , abruptly . IVANOFF Well , that may be . As for Rubashov , my instructions remain . He 's to have time for reflection . He 's to be left alone , and he will become his own torturer . GLETKIN I do n't agree . IVANOFF He 'll confess . He catches the expression in GLETKIN 's face , then sharply.You 're to leave him alone ! That 's an order . GLETKIN As you command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , and marches out as if on parade . IVANOFF curls his lip in disgust , pours himself a stiff drink , sighs heavily , and drinks as the scene fades out . The lights come up on all the cells . RUBASHOV is seated on his cot , smoking , wrapped in thought . The other prisoners are passing communications down the grapevine . p. 53 202 taps:All the prisoners ask Rubashov not to confess . Die in silence . 302 taps:Prisoners ask Rubashov not to confess . Die in silence . 402 crosses to RUBASHOV 's wall and signals . RUBASHOV raises his head , pauses , slowly rises , glances at the judas hole , then crosses to the wall , responds to the signal . 402 taps:Prisoners ask you not to give in . Do n't let them make you go on trial . RUBASHOV pause , then taps:How was 302 tortured ? 402 taps:Steam . RUBASHOV , grimly , puffs at his lit cigarette till it glows , blows off the ashes , presses the live coal into the back of his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue wisps of smoke that curl up from his burning flesh . Finally , he grinds out the cigarette , tosses it away . 402 taps again:You 'll die in silence ? You 'll die in silence ? RUBASHOV taps wearily:I will . Tell them . I will . 402 taps:My respects . You 're a man ! He crosses , taps on 302 's wall.Rubashov will die in silence . Pass it on . p. 54 302 taps:Rubashov will die in silence . Pass it on . The news is tapped through the prison and a murmur like a wind rises and falls : " Rubashov will die in silence Rubashov will die in silence " The lights fade , and the prisoners in the tier vanish . RUBASHOV staring at the scorched hand , crosses to his cot , sits , nods his head , and murmurs:As chimney sweepers come to dust to dust to dust The lights fade on him. @x RUBASHOV 'S cell , five weeks later . At rise : Darkness . Bars of light from the judas hole illumine RUBASHOV 'S feverish face . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He breathes heavily , moaning and tossing about fitfully on his cot . Ghostly images hover over and around him ; ghostly voices whisper hollowly : " Rubashov ! Rubashov ! " Echoes of the past  --  RICHARD 's voice calling : " Christ crowned with thorns ! , " LUBA 's voice , rich and low , " You can do anything you want with me . " The nameless ones appear and disappear , whispering , " Rubashov , Rubashov . " RUBASHOV dreaming , raises his head , his eyes shut , and cries out:Death is no mystery to us . There 's nothing exalted about it . It 's the logical solution to political divergencies . His head falls back again , turning from side to side , moaning . The lights come up in the corridor . A sound of heels on a stone floor . GLETKIN enters from a door right , coming up from the execution cellar ; he is followed by a young fellow officer . They move toward RUBASHOV 's cell , talking inaudibly . IVANOFF enters through the gate , glimpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gletkin ! " GLETKIN halts , turns to face IVANOFF . IVANOFF hobbles down to GLETKIN , scrutinizing him suspiciously:What are you up to ? p. 56 GLETKIN very correct:I do n't understand you , Comrade . IVANOFF No , I 'm sure you do n't . Have you been at my prisoner ? GLETKIN Been at him ? IVANOFF irritably:Laid your hands on him . You understand that , do n't you ? GLETKIN I have n't seen Citizen Rubashov for five weeks . However , I am informed , in the line of duty , his fever is worse . I suggest it would be advisable I bring him to the prison doctor . IVANOFF blows a smoke ring , then slowly , measuring his words:Keep away from him . And keep that prison doctor away from him . Sharply.My orders still stand . GLETKIN Very well , Comrade . They 'll be obeyed . IVANOFF , snorts , blows smoke into his face , then turns and limps off . They watch him go . The YOUNG OFFICER turns to GLETKIN , who has taken out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivanoff 's nerves are wearing thin . GLETKIN I 'm afraid this prisoner is proving stubborn . I told them when they brought him in that I could break him . p. 57 YOUNG OFFICER Easily . GLETKIN Comrade Ivanoff wants to use psychological methods only . YOUNG OFFICER scornfully:These old bookworms of the Revolution ! GLETKIN Tonight I 'm using psychological methods . Closes his notebook , puts it away. I 'll break this prisoner . YOUNG OFFICER Against orders ? GLETKIN No . I wo n't so much as go near his cell . But  --  Glances at his watch .  --  inside an hour he 'll be ready to confess . YOUNG OFFICER How ? GLETKIN enigmatically:It 'll be very interesting . RUBASHOV wakes , sits up with a sudden start , listening . The lights in the tier of cells come up . 402 sits up abruptly , wakening suddenly , also listens , frozen . 302 and 202 also awaken suddenly and listen to the ominous stillness . The lights fade on GLETKIN and the YOUNG OFFICER . The prisoners rise , one by one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once in a while , one of them will pause , listen , and then continue to pace . RUBASHOV rises , wipes the perspiration from his face with the sleeve of his coat , listens , then crosses to 402 's wall , taps , waits , and 402 responds . p. 58 RUBASHOV taps:Did I wake you ? 402 taps: No . RUBASHOV taps:Something 's happening . 402 taps: You feel it too ? RUBASHOV taps : What ? 402 taps: Do n't know . Something . How 's your fever ? RUBASHOV taps:Not good . 402 taps:Try to sleep . Overhead , 302 taps signal.Wait ! Crosses over to 302 's segment of wall , and answers the signal . 302 taps:Who is Bogrov ? 402 taps: Do n't know . Returns , taps.Who is Bogrov ? RUBASHOV taps:Mischa Bogrov ? 402 taps: No first name . RUBASHOV taps : I know a Mischa Bogrov . Why ? p. 59 402 taps:Name tapped through . RUBASHOV taps:He arrested ? 402 taps: Do n't know . Name Bogrov . That is all . RUBASHOV taps : What connection ? 402 taps: Do n't know . RUBASHOV to himself:Curious . The lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . RUBASHOV alone , thinking , smiles , murmurs:Mischa . He sits on his cot , shaking his head.Mischa ! A chorus of men singing is faintly heard . It grows louder . The bronze glow of a flickering campfire . Russian soldiers and marines of the Revolution , in conglomerate uniforms , half-military , half-civilian , laden with assorted weapons , dangling stick grenades and daggers , are gathered around the fire , smoking , warming their hands , singing . GENERAL RUBASHOV , his face shining with reflected firelight , shakes his head and beats out the tune , as a big , snub-nosed , sandy-haired marine with thick shoulders and an enchanting smile sings out in a mellow , ringing voice . p. 60 BOGROV " In the dawn 's light , faintly gleamingStand the ancient Kremlin walls ; And the land , no longer dreaming , Now awakes as morning calls.Though the winds are coldly blowing , Streets begin to hum with noise ; And the sun with splendor glowingGreets the land with all its joys.We 'll shout aloud for we are proud ; Our power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dear Moscow 's land . " The marine punctuates the finish by tossing his hat in the air . The others applaud and shout : " Bravo Mischa ! Bravo Mischa Bogrov ! " BOGROV laughs , crosses to RUBASHOV , unhooks from his belt a curved , elaborately chased , silver-handled dagger:Kolya RUBASHOV Yes , Mischa ? BOGROV presenting the dagger to him:Here , I want you to have this . To remember me . RUBASHOV laughs:You may need it , yourself . BOGROV shakes his head , grins . There is something of the good-natured , ingenuous child in this big man:No . The Civil War is over . No more killing . Now we go home . We build a new life . He extends the gift again.Please , take it . p. 61 RUBASHOV accepts it:All right , Mischa . Thank you . Now , I have something for you . Can you guess ? BOGROV thinks hard , frowning , then his eyes open wide:Kolya , is it Am I They 're ? RUBASHOV beaming , nods:Tomorrow you 'll be a member of the Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Party ! RUBASHOV You 've earned it . You fought well for the Revolution . BOGROV I 'm ignorant , Kolya ; I 'm just a stupid peasant and I do n't know enough yet  --  but I 'd die for the Revolution . RUBASHOV We know that . Now you must learn the meaning of it . You must go to school . You must study , Mischa . BOGROV I will , I will . You 'll see , you 'll be very proud of me . Wherever I am , every year on this day , I 'll send you a letter and I 'll sign it " Your Comrade , Faithful to the Grave . " The soldiers call for more song , " Come on , Mischa . More ! " For you , I sing this just for you , Kolya . BOGROV sings in a rich voice the chorus of " Red Moscow " : " We 'll shout aloud for we are proud , Our power is invincible.We 'll ne'er disband , we 'll always standTogether for dear Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men singing with him fade away , as do their voices , leaving RUBASHOV alone in his dank , silent , gray cell , nodding and humming the tune quietly to himself . Lights come up on 402 , who is tapping on RUBASHOV 's wall . RUBASHOV crosses to the wall , responds . p. 62 402 taps : What day ? RUBASHOV taps:Lost track . 402 taps : What you doing ? RUBASHOV taps:Dreaming. 402 taps:Sleeping ? RUBASHOV taps:Waking. 402 taps:Bad . What dreams ? RUBASHOV taps:My life . 402 taps: You wo n't confess ? RUBASHOV taps : I told you no. 402 taps:Die in silence is best . Pause . RUBASHOV to himself , sardonically:Yes . Die in silence ! Fade into darkness ! Easily said . Die in silence ! Vanish without a word ! Easily said . 402 taps:Walking ? RUBASHOV taps:Yes. p. 63 402 taps:Careful of blisters . Walking dreams bad for feet . I walked twelve hours in cell once . Wore out shoes . He laughs hoarsely.Did n't mind . He licks his lips , rolls his eyes , and moans voluptuously.Mm ! I was dreaming women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : After hot bath , well soaped all over , slippery . Ha ! Ha ! His laughter is tinctured with agony and madness.Ha ! Ha ! He stops , listens . The want of a response from RUBASHOV makes him suddenly angry.What 's matter ? You did n't laugh . Joke ! RUBASHOV shrugs his shoulders , taps:Ha ha ! 402 bursts into laughter again , taps:Ha ha ! Funny , ha ! RUBASHOV taps:Funny. 402 taps:How many women you love ? Pause.How many ? RUBASHOV taps:None. 402 taps: Why not ? RUBASHOV taps:My work . No time . 402 taps: You and Revolution . Some love affair ! Do n't you fellows have sex ? p. 64 RUBASHOV taps:Oh , yes . 402 taps : What you use it for ? Write in snow ? Ha ! Ha ! He doubles up with laughter , plucking at the lean flesh on his arms and thighs.Good joke ? RUBASHOV taps:Not good . 402 soured , taps: No sense humor . No wonder . Your women are half men ! Your women have moustaches . You killed the beauty of our women . Son of bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drily , taps:Repeating yourself . 402 taps:Confess . Never in love ? Once ? RUBASHOV taps: No . Never . He sighs heavily , frowns , thinking . 402 vanishes . A gray-haired man , HRUTSCH , materializes , sighing heavily and clutching his breast over the heart . HRUTSCH laughs timidly:It 's nothing . My heart skips about a bit . The cell fades away . HRUTSCH is standing at the desk in the office of the Commissariat of the Iron Works . The vista outside the window reveals the now-completed factory buildings . HRUTSCH is obviously frightened and nervous . p. 65 HRUTSCH squeezes his speech out in short spasmodic gasps:Yes , the files are ready for you , and of course you 'll want to see the charts . He turns to the darkness . LUBA LOSHENKO materializes , standing there with the charts in her hand , staring at RUBASHOV with large , luminous eyes and parted lips . She hands the charts to HRUTSCH , but her eyes never leave RUBASHOV.Ah , here we are . Now , anything you want explained , our secretary here knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Comrade Loshenko ? Hands the charts to RUBASHOV . RUBASHOV leaning heavily on a cane , steps forward . He walks with a slight limp:Yes . How have you been , Comrade Loshenko ? LUBA Very well , thank you , Comrade Rubashov . Welcome back home . HRUTSCH Many changes since you 've been gone . The factories are completed . RUBASHOV depositing the charts on the desk:You have n't filled your quota . Iron is off 23 percent , steel 38 percent . HRUTSCH Yes , yes , the sabotage is a problem . He sighs , clutches his heart . He laughs apologetically , indicating his heart.Every once in awhile it just starts hammering I should complain  --  look at him . The stories you could tell , Comrade Rubashov ? Those Nazis ! What they did to you ! And he escapes , comes home , and right to work . Wonderful spirit . Wonderful . What an example to us ! He laughs feebly , pants , holding his heart.Of course , as for us filling the new quota , mechanically it ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the orders . HRUTSCH again the fear rises , he essays a feeble smile:Well , if those are the orders , it will just have to be done , wo n't it ? RUBASHOV Yes . I 'll send for you . He dismisses him . HRUTSCH goes quickly . RUBASHOV turns . He looks at LUBA in silence , smiles . LUBA I wondered if I 'd ever see you again . RUBASHOV It was a question whether anyone would . LUBA I know . My prayers were answered . I prayed for you . RUBASHOV To which god ? LUBA I did . I prayed . RUBASHOV The same little bourgeoise , Luba . Are you married yet ? LUBA No . RUBASHOV Why not ? LUBA shrugs her shoulders.Any babies ? LUBA No . LUBA laughs.You 've no idea of the excitement here when we read that you were alive and home . We saw a picture of you when you arrived at Moscow , and our Leader had his arm around you . I was so proud . There is an embarrassed pause . p. 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor man , it 's not his fault . RUBASHOV Whose fault is it ? LUBA No one 's . The men are overworked , and She stops herself abruptly . RUBASHOV Go on . LUBA shakes her head:That 's all . Who am I to tell you ? RUBASHOV Go on ! Go on ! LUBA a sudden outpouring:They 're frightened . Last week more than forty workers were taken away by the G.P.U . RUBASHOV Well , we have to have discipline . Socialism is n't going to drop down on us from your nice , neat heaven . LUBA Yes , but the machines do n't know that . The machines break down , too . RUBASHOV Why ? LUBA The same reason . They 're overworked . RUBASHOV sighs:Problems . He puts the charts away , turns to her.Tell me about yourself . Any lovers ? p. 68 LUBA seriously:No . RUBASHOV teasing her:No ? Why not ? Put on those old earrings and find yourself a lover . LUBA I thought you were dead , and I did n't want to go on living . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world without knowing you were somewhere in it . RUBASHOV Come here . LUBA goes to him . He puts his arms around her and kisses her . LUBA begins to tremble and cry:I thought you were dead . I thought the Nazis had killed you . RUBASHOV burying his face in her hair:I 'm hard to kill . LUBA But they hurt you so . Your poor legs  --  they broke them ? RUBASHOV The pieces grow together . LUBA Was it awful ? RUBASHOV I forget . Holds her at arm 's length , studies her face.It 's good to see you again , Luba . LUBA Do you mean that ? RUBASHOV impersonally:Yes . He turns from her , picks up the charts.I have some dictation . Get your pad and pencil . And call in Hrutsch . I 'm afraid we 're going to have to get rid of that milksop . Crossing away from her into the shadows . p. 69 LUBA very quietly:Yes , Comrade Commissar . The memory scene fades . RUBASHOV , alone , leaning against the stone wall , sighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 402 appears , taps:Sad ! RUBASHOV taps : What ? 402 taps: You ! Never in love . To die without ever being in love . Sad ! A chill seizes RUBASHOV ; he groans , puts his hand to his swollen cheek , and shivers . RUBASHOV taps:Good night . 402 taps : What 's wrong ? RUBASHOV taps:My fever 's back . 402 taps:Again ? Maybe you should try the prison doctor ? RUBASHOV taps: No , thanks . 402 taps: Do n't blame you . A butcher ! They both turn from the wall , pace a few steps , and simultaneously freeze , listening , listening as if the silence itself contained some unheard and unholy sound . p. 70 RUBASHOV crosses to 402 , taps : What 's that ? 402 taps: You felt it again ? RUBASHOV taps:In the air 402 taps:Yes The lights fade on 402 . RUBASHOV wipes his feverish brow with the back of his sleeve and slowly paces to and fro , to himself:What if the Leader is right ? In spite of everything . In spite of the dirt and blood and lies . Suppose the Leader is right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continues to pace.Suppose the true foundations of the future are being built here ? History has always been an inhumane and unscrupulous builder , mixing its mortar of lies and blood and filth . He shivers again , pulls his coat tighter.Well , what of it , Rubashov ? Be logical . Have n't you always lived under the compulsion of working things out to their final conclusions ? He accelerates his pacing , counting the steps.1 2 3 4 5 and a half ; 1 2 3 4 5 and a half . He stops abruptly , as a thought strikes him.Yes . Yes . A sound of distant laughter . Slowly , the figures of some dockworkers materialize , sitting at a small iron table in a pub on the waterfront on the Marseilles docks . They are eating bread and cheese and drinking wine , talking loudly and laughing good-naturedly . A big , stocky man wearing a sailor 's sweater and stocking cap is seated next to a little hunchback who wears a sailor 's cap and a seaman 's pea jacket . Next to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is juggling some apples , and the others are watching and roaring with laughter . On the wall over the table is a militant poster demanding sanctions against Mussolini for his rape of Ethiopia . Benito 's caricature dominates the scene : the jutting jaw , the pop eyes , the little fez on the shaved dome . RUBASHOV , accompanied by ALBERT , a sharp-featured , young French intellectual , with long expressive hands , which are forever gesturing , and a mincing , epicene manner , approaches the table . The little hunchback sees them and rises . p. 71 ALBERT waving to him:Comrade Luigi , head of the Dockworkers ' Union . This is the comrade from Moscow . LUIGI smiles and extends his hand:We 're honored . We 're honored . He shakes RUBASHOV 's hand vigorously.Please sit down . He motions to the big dockworker.Comrade Pablo , business manager of the union . PABLO shakes hands:How do you like the job we 're doing here ? RUBASHOV You 've the strongest dockworkers ' union in Europe . PABLO Nothing 'll get by us . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our secretary . ANDRE Comrade . They shake hands . RUBASHOV and ALBERT sit . PABLO Those Italian ships out there will rot before we call off this strike . LUIGI Drink ? RUBASHOV Coffee , black . ALBERT A double fine . PABLO calls , off:One coffee , black . One double fine . p. 72 VOICE off:Coming . PABLO pointing off , shouts a warning to LUIGI:Luigi , look !  --  Here comes that cat again . ANDRE Meow ! Meow ! LUIGI jumping to his feet in panic , growls at the unseen cat:Get out ! Fft  --  out ! He throws a spoon across the floor . The cat obviously flees . ANDR and PABLO collapse in their chairs , holding their sides , filling the caf with booming laughter . LUIGI looks at them , shakes his head , laughs sheepishly . PABLO to RUBASHOV:Luigi do n't like cats . ANDRE But they love him . They come to him like to a bowl of cream . LUIGI They got no reason to . The three laugh . LUIGI 's laughter becomes a racking cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . They are silent until he leaves . ANDRE When Luigi escaped from Italy , he lived by killing cats . PABLO And selling their skins . LUIGI I had no papers . I could n't get a job . RUBASHOV You 're Italian ? p. 73 LUIGI I 'm a man without a country . He spits at Benito 's caricature.Three years ago I escaped . Benito was after me . I got here into France . No passport . The French police arrest me . Take me at night to the Belgian border . " We catch you here again , God help you ! " In Belgium the Belgian police arrest me . " No passport ? " Take me to the French border . Kick me back here into France . Six times back and forth . Luigi , the human football . He grimaces . His two comrades laugh appreciatively.A man without a country . They laugh louder and slap him on the back . He laughs.Well , I can laugh now , too , thanks to Pablo . I meet him in jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union . I 'm alive again , I belong . PABLO leans across the table confidentially to RUBASHOV:If you need any passports , I have a man will make you anything . A real artist . RUBASHOV nods:Thanks . I 'll remember that . ALBERT half rises , significantly:The comrade from Moscow has a message for us . LUIGI For us ? They all lean forward , intent . RUBASHOV In connection with this strike . p. 74 PABLO Ah ! The strike ? Do n't worry . Nothing 'll get by us . LUIGI Sh , Pablo ! To RUBASHOV.Your message ? RUBASHOV As you know , our strength in the Soviet Union is the strength of the revolutionary movement all over the world . PABLO hits the table with his fist:You can count on us ! LUIGI Sh , Pablo ! To RUBASHOV.The strike ? RUBASHOV The Italian shipyards are completing two destroyers and a cruiser for us . ALBERT For the Motherland of the Revolution ! RUBASHOV The Italian Government has informed Moscow if we want these ships this strike must be called off at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strike ? The dockworkers look at each other , stunned , bewildered . LUIGI But Moscow called on the world for sanctions ! ALBERT The comrade from over there has explained this is in the interest of the defense of the Motherland of the Revolution . p. 75 PABLO angrily:But the Fascists are taking on supplies to make war . ANDRE To kill Ethopian workers ! LUIGI To make slaves of them . ALBERT Comrades , sentimentality gets us nowhere . LUIGI gesticulates with his dirty handkerchief:But this is n't right ; we ca n't do this ! It is n't fair , it is n't just , it is n't RUBASHOV quickly , sharply:It is n't according to the rules laid down by the Marquis of Queensberry ? No , it is n't . But revolutions are n't won by " fair play " morality . That 's fine in the lulls of history , but in the crises , there is only one rule : The end justifies the means . LUIGI No , there are principles ; the whole world looks to you back there for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing at the scarlet stains on LUIGI 's handkerchief:You see ? Blood . He spits blood . Benito gave him that . And took two brothers in exchange . If you knew LUIGI That does n't matter . PABLO This is just scabbing. p. 76 ANDRE I vote to continue the strike . PABLO Strike . LUIGI Strike . The meeting is closed . He stands up . RUBASHOV rises quickly , decisively:No , it is n't ! I 'm in authority now . We have a job to be done here and it will be done . ALBERT In spite of agents provocateurs . PABLO reaches over , grabs ALBERT by the lapels of his coat , and shakes him . LUIGI rises:No , Pablo , stop that ! Stop ! PABLO releases ALBERT . LUIGI addresses ALBERT.Provocateurs ? For who , in God 's name ? ALBERT furious , his voice shrill:For the Fascists . PABLO Because we wo n't load their ships ? You hear , Comrades . That 's a joke  --  a rotten joke , is n't it ? LUIGI softly:No , it 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a joke . He looks up at the caricature of Mussolini.The joke is Benito brought me into socialism , me and my two brothers . We lived in Forli , 1911 . Italy was starting a war with Tripoli . There was a big anti-war meeting , banners , posters . Benito took the platform . Benito , the humble socialist , in a dirty black suit and a bow tie . He imitates the crowd . " Bravo , Benito ! " He mimics the gestures and facial expressions of Mussolini . " Fellow workers , militarism is our enemy ! We hate war ! " He becomes the crowd . " Bravo , Benito ! " Again he is Mussolini . " We do n't want iron discipline , we do n't want colonial adventures ! We want bread and schools and freedom . " " Bravo , Benito ! " He angrily admonishes the invisible crowd . " Do n't applaud me ! Do n't follow me . I hate fetishism . Follow my words ! " Softly , nodding to himself.Benito . He leans on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brothers and I. Ten years later he gives my brothers the castor-oil treatment . To some that sounds like a joke , too . You know what happens when a quart of castor oil is poured down your throat ? It tears your intestines to pieces , like you put them in a butcher 's grinder , to little pieces . Two brothers I had . Not like me . Well-formed , beautiful , like Michelangelo carved them out of Carrara marble  --  one a David and one a Moses . I , the ugly one , I escaped . Softly , tenderly.Two brothers I had and now  --  Fiercely .  --  Mother of God , I 'm a Fascist ! He coughs convulsively into his handkerchief.Back where I started with Benito . He spits at the caricature of Mussolini . p. 77 PABLO fervently:I swear to God it 's all true . ANDRE Luigi 's not a Fascist ! ALBERT rises , gesticulating with the long slender hands:Now , Comrades , you 're thinking mechanistically . Dialectically , the fact is that , whoever does not serve the long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore , even though he may think himself subjectively an anti-Fascist , he is in fact objectively a Fascist PABLO ironically seizes some dishes , tosses them into the air , juggles them , catches them , then proffers them to ALBERT with an ironic bow:Here ! You do it better than I. RUBASHOV rising:The ships are to be unloaded tomorrow . LUIGI Over my dead body . PABLO And mine . ANDRE And mine . RUBASHOV You can tear up your cards ! Silence.The meeting is adjourned . Indicating the phone.Albert . ALBERT nods , crosses to the phone , picks it up . LUIGI to the others:Come . The three men leave , LUIGI coughing as he does . p. 78 ALBERT at phone:Andr , Pablo , Luigi . Yes . Publish their pictures in tomorrow 's press . Front page . Agents provocateurs . Any Party member who even talks to them will be dismissed at once . RUBASHOV Their passports ! ALBERT Ah , of course . On phone.Also notify the French police their papers here are forged . Arrange for their immediate arrest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Now little Luigi is really a man without a country ! RUBASHOV stonily:Yes . ALBERT laughs . RUBASHOV turns a withering look of revulsion on him , and then , unable to endure it , shouts at him. What the hell are you laughing at ? What 's so funny ? ALBERT 's laughter dies in his throat . He looks pained and puzzled . With an exclamation of disgust , RUBASHOV walks away . The scene fades . RUBASHOV is back in his cell , pacing nervously . RUBASHOV Yes . We lived under the compulsion of working things out to their final conclusions . I thought and acted as I had to ; I destroyed people I was fond of ; I gave power to others I disliked . Well  --  History put you in that position , Rubashov . What else could you do ? But I 've exhausted the credit she gave me . Was I right ? Was I wrong ? I do n't know . The fact is , Rubashov , you no longer believe in your infallibility . That 's why you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replies . The lights come up on 402. p. 79 402 taps:Knew something was happening . RUBASHOV taps : : Explain . 402 taps:Executions . RUBASHOV to himself:Executions ? Taps.Who ? 402 taps: Do n't know . RUBASHOV taps : What time ? 402 taps:Soon . Pass it on . RUBASHOV goes to another wall of his cell , taps , receives an answering click , then he taps out the message:Executions soon . Pass it on . To himself , pacing.Perhaps this time it is you , Rubashov . Well , so long as they do it quickly . He stops , rubs his swollen cheek thoughtfully.But is that right ? You can still save yourself . One word  --  " Confess . " Fiercely.What does it matter what you say or what you sign ? Is n't the important thing to go on ? Is n't that all that matters ?  --  To go on ? An agonized look appears on his face , as an unbidden memory rises . Faint strains of music . LUBA 's voice humming the melody of the " Appassionata . " The prison vanishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright Sunday afternoon . The sun is pouring through the window , flooding the room with golden warmth . LUBA , kneeling , is snipping sprays of apple blossoms from a large bough spread out on a cloth laid on the floor . She is pruning the twigs preparatory to arranging them in a vase on the table . She hums happily . RUBASHOV enters , stands , watching her . She turns . p. 80 LUBA Oh ! I did n't hear you come in . She rises , goes to him , holding out the flowers as an offering . RUBASHOV touches them:Beautiful ! Where did you get them ? LUBA I took a long walk this morning in the country . They were lying on the ground . The branch had broken off an old apple tree . LUBA notices that RUBASHOV 's face is strained and lined with fatigue.You look tired . RUBASHOV I am . I 've been walking too . LUBA Not in the country ? RUBASHOV No . LUBA crosses to the table , arranges the flowers in the vase:If you want to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flowers , she opens a drawer , takes out a bar of chocolate , and hands it to him.Yesterday was my lucky day . RUBASHOV Chocolate ? LUBA triumphantly:Two bars . I ate one . They were the last in the store . I stood in line three hours . I had to battle for them , but I won . RUBASHOV softly , under the strain of some deep emotion:Thank you . p. 81 LUBA kneels , cutting more sprays off the branch , reminiscing:We had some apple trees at home . On Sundays we 'd help Father prune them . There was one huge old tree so gnarled and full of bumps . We had a special affection for that tree . Tch , the pains Father took to save it . We called it his " patient . " Rises with the blooms.One spring morning he took us out to look at the " patient . " It was blossom time . The other apple trees did n't have many blossoms that year  --  but the " patient " You 've never seen so many blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tree was all covered with blooms like snow . Then Father said , " I 'm going to lose my patient . " RUBASHOV Why 'd he say that ? LUBA An apple tree puts out its most beautiful bloom just before it dies . RUBASHOV I did n't know that . LUBA It 's true . The next year the " patient " was gone . RUBASHOV Oh ! LUBA When I 'm working at the factory , everything seems matter-of-fact ; but whenever I go out to the country , the world suddenly becomes full of mystery . LUBA looks at RUBASHOV . He sits slowly , a strained expression on his face.What is it ? What 's wrong ? p. 82 RUBASHOV shakes his head:Troubles . LUBA At the factory ? RUBASHOV tastes the chocolate:There , too . All over . Upheavals . He glances at the chocolate evasively.This chocolate is made of soya beans . Tastes almost like real chocolate . He sighs , pauses.Luba LUBA Yes ? RUBASHOV carefully places the chocolate on the table , speaks softly , deliberately:Orders came in late yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moscow . LUBA 's hand , lifting a spray of blossoms to the vase , freezes in mid-air.You 're to leave tonight . LUBA Tonight ? RUBASHOV evading her glance:Those are the orders . There 's a train at ten o'clock . LUBA trying desperately to control her mounting terror:Why am I being sent back there ? RUBASHOV They 're investigating the files and production records . LUBA How long will I be gone ? p. 83 RUBASHOV I do n't know that , Luba . LUBA Why did n't you tell me last night ? RUBASHOV I wanted to find out what it is about . LUBA But I 've so much work at the office to clean up . So many RUBASHOV rises:It 's hurried , I know . But that 's the way the Bureau does things . LUBA What have I done wrong ? RUBASHOV Nothing . LUBA Has my work been unsatisfactory ? RUBASHOV It 's been excellent . LUBA the terror in her voice now:Then why am I being sent back ? RUBASHOV patiently , soothingly:I told you , they 're examining the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else will take on my job here ? RUBASHOV Only while you 're gone . LUBA turns to RUBASHOV , childishly:I do n't want to go . RUBASHOV You have to , Luba. p. 84 LUBA crossing to RUBASHOV , pleading:Ca n't you help me ? RUBASHOV You understand , I have enemies . It would look bad for you , if I interceded . LUBA For me ? RUBASHOV For both of us . As if I wanted to conceal something . LUBA her love and her fear for him taking precedent , she studies him:You 're not in any trouble ? RUBASHOV No . LUBA You 're sure ? RUBASHOV Yes . There is a long pause . LUBA very simply and directly:They 're not going to arrest me ? RUBASHOV Of course not . LUBA I 'm frightened . She sits , looks about helplessly , a trapped animal . RUBASHOV goes to her , places his hands soothingly on her shoulders:There 's no need to be . If they should interrogate you , tell them the truth . You have nothing to fear . Just tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of panic explode , and she cries out. I 'm not going to Moscow . I just wo n't go . p. 85 RUBASHOV quickly , trying to control the panic:Then it would look as if you had done something wrong , would n't it ? LUBA turns to RUBASHOV , hysterically:But I have n't , I have n't . RUBASHOV I know that , Luba . LUBA her hysteria mounting , her body trembling , her voice becoming shrill:Oh God ! I want to run away . I want to hide ! I want to run away . RUBASHOV grips her arms tightly:Nothing 's going to happen to you . Understand ? There are no charges against you . Nothing 's going to happen . Nothing , nothing ! He holds her tight and kisses her . She clings to him with all her strength , wildly , passionately returning his embrace . Then she goes limp , withdraws , looks at him , smiles sadly , shakes her head . LUBA I 'm sorry . I 'm stupid . She turns to gather up the flowers from the floor. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . LUBA The tickets ? And my travel warrant ? RUBASHOV plucks them out of his pocket and hands them to her . She takes them quietly . She rises , and , tonelessly.I 'll have to pack now . p. 86 RUBASHOV Yes . I 'll go . LUBA Not yet . RUBASHOV It would be best for both of us , at this time . LUBA Yes , I suppose so . She looks at the bouquet of blossoms in her hands.Would n't it be wonderful if we could just say " No " to them ? If we could come and go as we wished , all of us ? RUBASHOV But we ca n't , Luba . That would be anarchy . We have n't the right . He crosses into the shadows . LUBA almost inaudibly:No . Of course not . We have n't the right . LUBA , flowers , room , and sunlight , all fade away , leaving RUBASHOV alone in his dank cell , talking to himself . RUBASHOV And have I the right to say " No " ? Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk out , to die out of mere tiredness , personal disgust , and vanity ? Have I this right ? The lights come up in the other cells . The prisoners , ears to the wall , are listening for the news . 202 has just received a message . He crosses to 302 's wall . 202 taps: They 're reading death sentence to him now . Pass it on . He shuttles back to the other post to listen . p. 87 302 crosses , taps on 402 's wall:They 're reading death sentence to him now . Pass it on . Shuttles back to listen . 402 taps: They 're reading death sentence now . Pass it on . RUBASHOV taps:Who is he ? But 402 has crossed back to listen to the next messsage . RUBASHOV crosses to the rear wall , taps.They 're reading death sentence to him now . Pass it on . RUBASHOV crosses back to 402 's wall to listen . 202 crosses to wall , taps to 302:They are bringing him , screaming and hitting out . Pass it on . 202 returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taps to 402:They are bringing him , screaming and hitting out . Pass it on . 302 returns to his other post . 402 taps to RUBASHOV:They are bringing him , screaming and hitting out . Pass it on . RUBASHOV taps , urgently:Who is he ? But 402 has gone back to the opposite wall to listen for more news . RUBASHOV shuffles over to the rear wall and taps.They are bringing him , screaming and hitting out . Pass it on . Then he moves back to 402 's wall and taps insistently.Who is he ? 402 crosses to RUBASHOV 's wall , listening . RUBASHOV , very clearly.What 's his name ? p. 88 402 taps:Mischa Bogrov . RUBASHOV suddenly becomes faint , wipes the sweat from his forehead and for a moment braces himself against the wall , walks slowly to the rear wall and leans heavily against it as he taps through:Mischa Bogrov , former sailor on Battleship Potemkin , Commander of the Baltic Fleet , bearer of Order of Red Banner , led to execution ! Pass it on . 202 taps:Now ! He crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 302 taps:Now ! He crosses to the door and starts drumming on the iron surface . 402 taps:Now ! He crosses to the door and starts drumming on the iron surface . RUBASHOV taps:Now ! Drags himself across the cell and starts drumming on the door 's iron surface . The prison becomes vibrant with the low beat of subdued drumming . The men in the cells who form the acoustic chain stand behind their doors like a guard of honor in the dark , create a deceptive resemblance to the muffled solemn sound of the roll of drums , carried by the wind from the distance . At the far end of the corridor , the grinding of iron doors becomes louder . A bunch of keys jangle . The iron door is shut again . The drumming rises to a steady , muffled crescendo . Sliding and squealing sounds approach quickly , a moaning and whimpering like the whimpering of a child is heard . Shadowy figures enter the field of vision . Two dimly lit figures , both in uniform , drag between them a third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs slack and yet with doll-like stiffness in their grasp , stretched out its full length , face turned to the ground , belly arched downwards , the legs trailing after , the shoes scraping on the toes . Whitish strands of hair hang over the face , the mouth is open . As they turn the corner of the corridor and open the trapdoor to the cellar , we see that this tortured , mangled face is BOGROV 's . GLETKIN now appears , whispers in his ear . BOGROV straightens up , looks about , flings off his captors for a moment , and moans out some vowels . p. 89 BOGROV Oo a ah ; Oo a ah ! Then , with a mighty effort , he articulates the word and bellows out.Rubashov ! Rubashov ! RUBASHOV pounds on his door like a madman , screaming:Mischa ! Mischa ! The other prisoners accelerate their drumming . BOGROV is dragged through the cellar door ; it clangs shut , and we can hear his voice as he is being dragged down to the execution cellar , growing fainter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the drumming dies down , the other prisoners vanish , a deep terrible silence settles on the prison . RUBASHOV stands in the middle of his cell , clutching his stomach to prevent himself from vomiting . He staggers to his cot , collapses on it , and is enveloped by complete darkness . There is a long silence . From somewhere above a prisoner cries out , " Arise , ye wretched of the earth ! " The electric light in RUBASHOV 's cell is suddenly turned on . IVANOFF is standing next to his bed with a bottle of brandy and a glass . RUBASHOV , his eyes glazed , is staring , unseeing , into space . IVANOFF You feel all right ? RUBASHOV It 's hot ! Open the window ! He looks up at IVANOFF.Who are you ? p. 90 IVANOFF Would you like some brandy ? RUBASHOV 's eyes follow him , dull , uncomprehending . IVANOFF pours a drink , extends it to RUBASHOV . Sits next to him.Drink this . IVANOFF holds the glass , feeding the drink to RUBASHOV . RUBASHOV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? IVANOFF No . I only came to visit you . He places the bottle and the glass on the floor. I think you 're ill . Are you in pain ? RUBASHOV No . IVANOFF Your cheek is swollen . I think you 've a fever . RUBASHOV Give me a cigarette . IVANOFF gives him a cigarette , lights it for him . RUBASHOV inhales the smoke deeply , hungrily . After a few moments of this , his eyes come into focus , his breathing becomes a little more regular , and he looks at IVANOFF , who is patiently blowing smoke rings.What time is it ? IVANOFF Two-thirty A.M. RUBASHOV How long have I been here ? IVANOFF Five weeks tomorrow . RUBASHOV examines IVANOFF . He is beginning to think quite clearly now:What are you doing here ? p. 91 IVANOFF I want to talk to you . Some more brandy ? Picks up the bottle . RUBASHOV the iron creeping into his voice:No , thank you . IVANOFF Lie down . Rest ! RUBASHOV sits up , spits out:You pimp ! Get out of here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You disgust me  --  you and your filthy tricks . IVANOFF Tricks ? Pours a drink . RUBASHOV raging:You drag him by my cell  --  Bogrov  --  or what you 've left of him , and when my bowels are split open , a savior appears with a bottle of brandy . You think I can be taken in by a cheap trick like that ? You think you can wheedle a confession out of me with a bottle of brandy ? IVANOFF smiles and shows his gold teeth:You really believe that I have such a primitive mind ? RUBASHOV Take your whorish mind the hell out of here ! It stinks ! It 's choking me . IVANOFF drinks:Very well . I 'll go if you want me to . RUBASHOV You can not begin to understand how you disgust me . All of you . p. 92 IVANOFF But first , you listen to me for one second . RUBASHOV shouts:I do n't want to hear any more IVANOFF outshouts him: I 'm afraid you 'll have to ! Pauses , gently.Now listen logically and calmly , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been shot ! There is a long silence as RUBASHOV absorbs this news , then  --  RUBASHOV low , strangulated:Good ! IVANOFF He was also tortured for several days . RUBASHOV That was obvious . IVANOFF It was meant to be . But not by me . Sits next to RUBASHOV , placing the bottle on the floor. I 'm going to put my life in your hands , Kolya . RUBASHOV looks at him.If you mention what I tell you , to anyone , I am done for . This filthy trick , as you call it , was arranged by my young colleague , Gletkin , against my instructions . I would never make this mistake , not out of concern for you , but because it 's bad psychology . You 've recently been suffering humanitarian scruples ? A scene with Bogrov could only intensify them . Obvious ? Only a fool like Gletkin makes such mistakes . He 's been urging me to use his methods on you too ! p. 93 RUBASHOV You can torture me ; it will get you no results . IVANOFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle.You do n't know Gletkin . He fills the glass , studies it. He 's something new in the world  --  the Neanderthal Man ! He came after the flood . He had no umbilical cord to the past . He was born without a navel . He does n't approve of us old apes in general , and of youin particular . He shakes his head at RUBASHOV.It seems the other day you showed him your behind . He did n't like that . Ominously.He wants to lay his big hands on you . RUBASHOV I 'm quite prepared to die . IVANOFF But I 'm not prepared to let you die . Your martyrdom , Kolya , will consist of not being allowed to become a martyr . That 's not why you 're here . We need you , and we need you logical , because when you 've thought the whole thing out clearly , then , but only then , will you make your confession . Am I right ? RUBASHOV Go away , it 's no use . IVANOFF Do you believe that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose so . p. 94 IVANOFF Then why do you want me to go ? He bends forward , pushing his face into RUBASHOV 's , mockingly.Because you are afraid of me , because my way of reasoning is your way and you 're afraid of the echoes in your own head . RUBASHOV impatiently:I 've had enough of this reasoning . We 've been running amok with it for thirty years . Enough . IVANOFF Get thee behind me , Satan . Rises , goes to the door , peers out the judas hole , turns back.In the old days temptation was carnal . It took the form of little naked women running around shaking their things in your face . Today it 's cerebral . It takes the form of naked reason pushing facts in your face . Values change . He drinks . RUBASHOV Why was Bogrov tortured ? IVANOFF He was stubborn like you . RUBASHOV Did you hear him whimpering ? IVANOFF No . I did n't hear it . But I 've heard and seen others . He wheels on RUBASHOV , stabbing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you , my General ! He hobbles to RUBASHOV , face thrust forward , accusingly.What of it ? A conscience is as unsuited to a revolutionary as a double chin . Since when did N. S. Rubashov develop this bourgeois conscience ? Hm ? When ? Pause.Shall I tell you ? The day , the hour , the minute ? Nine months , two weeks ago  --  at 3:10 A.M.  --  when your little secretary , Luba Loshenko , was shot ! He sits next to RUBASHOV.You were sleeping with her , were n't you ? Now she 's dead . So you 're making the world a metaphysical brothel for your emotions . What have the shape of Luba Loshenko 's breasts or Bogrov 's whimperings to do with the new world we 're creating ? p. 95 RUBASHOV Bogrov 's dead , she 's dead . You can afford a little pity . IVANOFF I have many vices  --  I drink , for a time , as you know , I took drugs ; but so far I 've avoided the vice of pity . One drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass.The great temptation ! To renounce violence , to make peace with ourselves hm ? He drinks.I prefer my synthetic ecstasy in a glass . You get over it in the morning . RUBASHOV after a long silence , shakes his head , murmurs sadly:Our golden dream ! Then savagely.What a stinking mess we 've made of it . IVANOFF setting down the glass , articulates carefully:Have we ? He lights a fresh cigarette.We 've taken the land from the landlords . He blows a smoke ring.We 've freed them from industrial exploitation . He blows another.For the first time in history a revolution is functional . RUBASHOV Functional ? He jumps to his feet , furious.So functional in taking the land , in one year , we let five million farmers and their families die of starvation ! Deliberately . So functional  --  He begins to pace up and down .  --  in freeing the people from industrial exploitation , we sent ten million of them to forced labor under worse conditions than galley slaves . He plucks off his spectacles nervously and waves them at IVANOFF.So functional , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one argument  --  Death !  --  whether it 's a matter of submarines , manure , or the party line in Indochina . Death ! He replaces his spectacles and glares at IVANOFF. p. 96 IVANOFF rises , belligerently:That woman has really given you softening of the brain ! What of the millions who die of starvation in China and India , of tuberculosis in rice fields , cotton plantations ? RUBASHOV In negatives we agree . Where has it led us ? IVANOFF Well , where ? RUBASHOV Our standard of living is lower than the most backward country in Europe . Labor conditions are harder ; discipline 's more inhuman . Our country is run by the police . Again he plucks off the glasses for emphasis.We 've torn the living skin off our people and left them standing with bare tissues , muscles and nerves quivering . IVANOFF Well , and what of it ? With warmth and conviction.Do n't you find that wonderful ? Has anything more wonderful ever happened in history ? We 're tearing the old skin off mankind and giving it a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak nerves , but there was a time it filled you with enthusiasm . RUBASHOV I know . IVANOFF Look at the pamphlets put out by the antivivisectionists . When you read how some poor cur who has just had his liver cut out , whines and licks his tormentor 's hand , it breaks your heart . But if we listened to these sentimentalists , we 'd have no cures for typhus , cholera , diphtheria p. 97 RUBASHOV I know , I know , I know . He turns away , sits , moodily . IVANOFF following him , persistently:Of course you do . Better than I. And you still insist on being a martyr ? He waits for an answer . Finally he throws up his hands and growls in disgust.All right . Have it your way . He picks up the bottle and glass.If you must throw yourself into the dustbin of history , I ca n't stop you . Go . Let Gletkin have you . You 're his . He turns to the door , pauses , turns back . His voice becomes soft.Only tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with death ? It stinks ! Why do you want to die ? RUBASHOV hoarsely:I do n't want to die . No one does . IVANOFF You act as if you do . RUBASHOV It 's a fake . He clutches his throat.From here up , I 'm resigned . From here down , I 'm frightened . IVANOFF Yet I offer you your life . RUBASHOV On what terms ? IVANOFF The only terms that matter . To go on being useful . He places the bottle on the floor and fumbles in his pocket . p. 98 RUBASHOV To act the fool in public trial ? No , thanks . The terms are too high . IVANOFF taking out an official communication , pushes it under RUBASHOV 's nose:Here 's a confidential report I received today . RUBASHOV takes it , glances at it.Read between the lines . RUBASHOV drily:I need no instructions , thank you . Studies the document . IVANOFF What do you see ? RUBASHOV War ! It 's coming . IVANOFF How soon ? RUBASHOV Depends on how we play our cards . Perhaps years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , Kolya ; the next gives us the world . Or does it ? RUBASHOV It could , if IVANOFF If ? Good ! He sits next to him.There 's a breach in the Party , in the whole country ; the people are restless , dissatisfied ; our economy is in pieces . The breach must be mended first ; and you , and those who think like you , must mend it ! RUBASHOV Hence the trials ! Hands him back the document , contemptuously.They 're better than the opera or the theatre . p. 99 IVANOFF The goal , Kolya . It 's coming . Nearer . Listen . You can hear it on the wind . And when that day comes RUBASHOV The Gletkins take over . IVANOFF They 're brutes . They do n't count . RUBASHOV plucking off his spectacles and glaring at IVANOFF:Who made them brutes ? We did ! Their Byzantine leader worship is frightening . Their cultivated ignorance is disgusting . IVANOFF Would they have been any use to us any other way ? RUBASHOV You 'd trust our revolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck to save you ? It 's your brain I want to save . When the day comes , your brain will be needed . We 'll get rid of them . You 'll be needed more than ever ! RUBASHOV studies him , replaces his spectacles , shakes his head:If I thought that IVANOFF strongly:Think it ! Think it ! He watches RUBASHOV wrestle with the thought , then leans forward , and softly.What other choice have you ? To become a Christian martyr ? For the Western democracies ? RUBASHOV rises , angrily:What are you talking about , " the Western democracies " ? What have I to do with those decadent humanists  --  those phantoms of religion and superstition ? p. 100 IVANOFF pressing his point , sharpening his irony:Do you want their liberal press , that hated your guts while you were alive , to sanctify you after your death ? RUBASHOV The liberal press ? Those puking jackals of holy property ? What have I to do with them ? I 'd rather be two feet of manure in a Russian field . He nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll put you in a stained-glass window . Saint Rubashov  --  the martyr for the Western world ! Is that what you want ? RUBASHOV looks at him , looks away , ponders , replaces the spectacles , sighs . For a long time he stands there , head bowed , wrapped in thought . IVANOFF watches him patiently . RUBASHOV finally , wearily:I 'll think it over . IVANOFF triumphantly picks up his bottle , rises , and going to the judas hole , calls:Guard ! He turns back to RUBASHOV , beaming.You old warhorse . You 've had an attack of nerves . The GUARD opens door.But that 's over now . Go to bed . Get some sleep . You 'll need a clear head tomorrow when we make up your statement . p. 101 RUBASHOV frowning:I said I 'll think it over . IVANOFF nods , laughs:Good night , Kolya . RUBASHOV Good night , Sascha . IVANOFF goes . RUBASHOV stands , thinking , thinking . In the corridor , IVANOFF sees GLETKIN , leaning against the wall , watching RUBASHOV 's cell . IVANOFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tonight ? Pause . He blows a smoke ring.It 's all right . He 'll confess . But I had to sweat blood to repair the damage you did . You are all still suffering from personal feelings . In his place you 'd be even more stubborn . GLETKIN I have some backbone , which he has n't . IVANOFF But you 're an idiot ! For that answer alone , you ought to be shot before he is ! He blows a cloud of cigarette smoke directly into GLETKIN 's face , shows his gold teeth in a grin of utter disdain , and hobbles off down the corridor . GLETKIN stands there as if he were made of stone , the face completely without expression , then he raises his hand and waves aside the fumes of smoke with a sudden , quick gesture. @x RUBASHOV 's cell ; several days later . At rise : RUBASHOV seated on the cot , his shoes off , his coat thrown over his shoulders , a pad of blank paper on his knee , is writing intently , completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page , writes rapidly . Alongside him is a stack of completed pages . The tensions and the fever appear to have abated . As he writes , three taps are heard from 402 's wall . He ignores them . Three more taps . Then three more . He glances up , annoyed , but continues to work . The taps now flow from 402 's wall rapidly and insistently in a staccato stream . With an exclamation of annoyance , RUBASHOV tears off the page he has just completed , lays it carefully on the pile next to him , rises , and , crossing to the wall , taps . The lights come up on 402. 402 taps : I tried to talk to you all day . Why did n't you answer ? RUBASHOV taps : I 've been busy . 402 taps:How ? RUBASHOV taps:Writing. 402 taps : What ? RUBASHOV taps:A new theory . p. 103 402 taps : What about ? RUBASHOV smiling ironically , taps:The immaturity of the masses . The historical necessity for dictatorship . 402 taps:Repeat ! RUBASHOV taps:Never mind . 402 taps : What 's happened ? RUBASHOV taps : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUBASHOV taps : I am confessing . 402 pauses:stunned by this volte-face , then angrily , taps : I 'd rather hang . RUBASHOV cynically , taps:Each in his own way . 402 taps slowly:I thought you an exception . Have you no honor ? RUBASHOV taps:Our ideas of honor differ . 402 taps:Honor is to live and die for your beliefs . p. 104 RUBASHOV taps : I am living for mine . 402 taps louder and more sharply:Honor is decency . RUBASHOV taps slowly , calmly:What is decency ? 402 very excited , taps:Something your kind will never understand . RUBASHOV taps:We have replaced decency by reason . 402 taps : What reason ? RUBASHOV taps:Pure reason . 402 taps: You 're pure son of bitch . RUBASHOV amused , chuckles and taps:Flattery does not impress me. 402 taps : I 'll never talk to you again . The scene is interrupted by a jangling sound . The door of RUBASHOV 's cell is thrown open . A YOUNG OFFICER enters . YOUNG OFFICER Put on your shoes ! RUBASHOV Well ! It 's about time ! Crosses to the cot , sits , and proceeds to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivanoff for several days . p. 105 YOUNG OFFICER Put on your shoes , and come with me . RUBASHOV You might have timed it a little more considerately . But I suppose you Neanderthal men only come out after midnight . YOUNG OFFICER Do n't talk so much . Just put on your shoes and hurry up . RUBASHOV looks at the OFFICER , smiles , shakes his head as he ties the laces:Brutes ! He rises , the OFFICER motions him out with a jerk of the head . RUBASHOV goes , remarking over his shoulder.But then you would n't be any use to us if you were n't , would you ? Exit . The OFFICER frowns , follows him out . The lights in the cell dim out . 402 watching at the judas hole:Son of a bitch ! He crosses up to 302 's wall , taps . The lights come up in the tier above . 302 is pacing . He stops at the sound of tapping , crosses , and listens . 402 taps:Rubashov is a filthy coward . 302 taps: You 're wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is mistaken p. 106 302 taps : What 's he done ? 402 taps:He 's saving his skin . He 's confessing . They 've taken him up now . 302 taps:Oh , my God ! Pray for me. 402 taps:For you ? 302 taps:Yes , for me . He crosses , taps on 202 's wall . The lights come up on 202 , who responds and listens . 302 taps.Rubashov confessing . Pass it on . 202 groans , crosses to opposite wall , taps:Rubashov confessing . Pass it on The tappings multiply and the murmur " Rubashov confessing , Rubashov confessing " echoes back and forth through the prison . The cells dim out slowly as the lights come up on IVANOFF 's office . Seated at the desk , his chair wheeled around , his back to us , is a man in uniform , apparently IVANOFF . RUBASHOV enters , accompanied by the GUARD . There is a faint ironic smile on RUBASHOV 's lips as he enters . The man seated at the desk swings his chair round to face RUBASHOV . It 's not IVANOFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stony-faced . The smile on RUBASHOV 's lips vanishes , he pauses in his stride , looks about quickly . Near GLETKIN a grim-lipped young woman , obviously a secretary , sits , sharpening her pencils . p. 107 GLETKIN rises , waves the GUARD out:Shut the door ! The GUARD goes , shutting the door behind him . GLETKIN turns to a heavy floor lamp nearby and switches it on . There is a humming sound , and a fierce , white light strikes RUBASHOV full in the eyes . He jerks his face away as if he 'd been struck , then turns back to face GLETKIN , squinting and shielding his eyes with his hand . GLETKIN sits , picks up some official documents.We will proceed with your examination . You wish to make a full confession ? RUBASHOV takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes:Yes . To Commissar Ivanoff . Not to you . GLETKIN You will make your confession to me , here and now , or this investigation is closed , and you will be sentenced at once . Those are my orders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet GLETKIN 's gaze , but the harsh light blinds him . He removes his glasses again.You have your choice . Which is it ? RUBASHOV avoiding the light:I am ready to make a statement . GLETKIN Sit there . RUBASHOV On one condition . He turns to GLETKIN firmly , even though he has to almost shut his eyes.Turn off that dazzle-light ! Save these devices for gangsters. p. 108 GLETKIN calmly:You 're in no position to make conditions . The fact is you are charged with being the worst kind of " gangster . " RUBASHOV controls his anger:Exactly what are these charges ? Please read them to me . Up till now this has n't been done . GLETKIN Very well . Sit here ! RUBASHOV sits in the chair upon which the dazzle-light has been trained . GLETKIN reads the official statement in a rapid monotone . " Enemy of the people , Nicolai Semonovitch Rubashov , you are charged with being a counterrevolutionary in the pay of hostile , foreign governments ; of having , at the instigation of their agents , committed such acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military power of the U.S.S.R. You are also charged with having incited an accomplice to attempt the assassination of the Leader of the Party , i.e. , you are charged with crimes covered by Articles 58-1A ; 58-2 ; 58-7 ; 58-9 ; and 58-11 of the Criminal Code . " He drops the official papers and looks up.You 've heard the charges ? You plead guilty ? RUBASHOV turns to face him , shielding his eyes with his hand:I plead guilty to having fallen out of step with historical necessity . I plead guilty to bourgeois sentimentality . I plead guilty to having wanted an immediate alleviation of the Terror , and extension of freedom to the masses . The secretary , who is writing this in shorthand , smiles contemptuously . RUBASHOV glances at her. Do n't be cynical , young woman To GLETKIN.I now realize fully that the regime is right and I am wrong . The times demand a tightening of the dictatorship ; any sentimental aberrations at the present moment in history could become suicide . In this sense can you call me a counterrevolutionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the accusation I have nothing to do . I deny them categorically . p. 109 GLETKIN Have you finished ? RUBASHOV I deny that I , Rubashov , ever plotted against my country . I deny that I am in the pay of a foreign government . I deny any act of sabotage . I deny ever having taken the least part in any act of terror against the Leader of the Party . To the stenographer , quietly.Have you all that , young woman ? GLETKIN Have you finished ? RUBASHOV I have finished . GLETKIN Wipe your lips then . They 're slimy with lies . Lies ! Lies ! Vomit ! He snatches a thick dossier off the desk , and cracks RUBASHOV across the face with it.The statement you have just made is vomit . Enough nobility ! Enough posturing ! Enough strutting ! What we demand of you is not high talk , but a full confession of your real crimes ! RUBASHOV his hand to his face , breathing hard , biting back the indignation , fighting for control:I can not confess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the desk:Oh , no , that you can not . The GUARD enters , bringing in 302 , whose eyes at once fix on GLETKIN , and who moves and talks like a sleepwalker . There is something in his manner of the helpless child , desperately eager to be " good " and to please . GLETKIN dismisses the GUARD with a nod , then points to a spot on the floor.Step over here . Immediately , 302 nods and shuffles over to stand correctly as designated . GLETKIN crosses above the desk . To RUBASHOV.Do you know this person ? Pause . Harshly.You will please pay attention ! Do you know this person ? p. 110 RUBASHOV The light 's in my eyes . GLETKIN softly:Stand up ! RUBASHOV hesitates . GLETKIN roars.Stand up ! RUBASHOV rises.Step over there ! He points to 302 . RUBASHOV walks up closer.Do you recognize him now ? RUBASHOV shielding his eyes from the blinding light , scrutinizes 302 , then shakes his head:No . GLETKIN You 've never met him before ? RUBASHOV hesitates:Mm No . GLETKIN You hesitated . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GLETKIN Your memory was once proverbial in the Party . A long pause.You refuse to answer ? RUBASHOV I do not refuse to answer . I simply do not place him . GLETKIN Good . Sit down . RUBASHOV sits . GLETKIN turns to 302 . Help Citizen Rubashov 's memory . Where did you last meet him ? 302 Citizen Rubashov instigated me to murder the Leader of the Party by poison p. 111 GLETKIN irritably:I did n't ask you that . I asked you where you last met him . RUBASHOV smiles grimly , and mutters:Wrong lever . GLETKIN turns on him , snaps:What ? RUBASHOV The automatic barrel organ played the wrong tune . GLETKIN ominously:I warn you . Remember where you are . We want none of your so-called wit . Nods to 302. 302 I met Citizen Rubashov in Brussels . GLETKIN Can you remember the date ? 302 Distinctly . It was on the 17th anniversary of the Revolution . At his apartment ! RUBASHOV studying 302 , suddenly puts his hand to his forehead:Yes , of course . The date is correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLETKIN You admit you knew him then ? You met him on the day and occasion aforementioned ? RUBASHOV his eyes glued to the terrible spectacle of 302 's mangled , ghostlike mask:I 've just told you that . If you 'd informed me at once that he was the son of my unfortunate friend , Professor Kieffer , I 'd have identified him sooner . p. 112 GLETKIN turns to 302:How did this meeting come about ? 302 After the reception at the Legation my father took me up to Citizen Rubashov 's apartment . GLETKIN nods:Go on . 302 He and my father had n't seen each other for years . They talked about the early days of the Revolution . GLETKIN They were drinking ? 302 Yes . They drank and talked . A faraway look and a gentle smile illumine his face at the memory.In the last few years I 've never seen my father in such a good mood . GLETKIN quietly:That was three months before the discovery of your father 's counterrevolutionary crimes and his execution ! 302 darts a glance at him , licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to GLETKIN on a sudden impulse , but , blinded by the light , he shuts his eyes and turns slowly away , taking off his spectacles and wiping them on his sleeve . The secretary 's pencil scratches on the paper and stops . After a long pause 302 regains himself . 302 Yes . GLETKIN Proceed ! Repeat their conversation . Only essentials . p. 113 302 He said GLETKIN Rubashov ? 302 Yes . Rubashov said , since the Boss sat on the Party with his broad posterior , the air underneath was no longer breathable . He said they must hold tight and wait the hour . GLETKIN What did he mean by that ? " Wait the hour " ? 302 The hour in which the Leader would be eliminated . RUBASHOV smiles . GLETKIN These reminiscences seem to amuse you . RUBASHOV Two old friends get a little drunk , talk carelessly , and you make a conspiracy . GLETKIN So Rubashov spoke of the hour in which the Leader of the Party would be eliminated ? How eliminated ? 302 My father said someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubashov ? 302 Laughed . He said the Boss had made the Party bureaucracy his puppets . He said the Boss could only be removed by force . RUBASHOV By this I meant political action . GLETKIN As opposed to what ? RUBASHOV Individual terrorism . p. 114 GLETKIN In other words , you preferred civil war ? RUBASHOV No , mass action . GLETKIN Which leads to civil war . Is that the distinction on which you place so much value ? RUBASHOV loses patience , shouting:I can not think straight with that damned light in my eyes . GLETKIN outshouts him: I ca n't change the lighting in this room to suit you . To 302 , quietly.So Rubashov said they had to use violence ? 302 nods.And his wild talk , plus the alcohol he 'd fed you , inflamed you ? 302 after a pause:I did n't drink , but he  --  yes , he made a deep impression on me . GLETKIN And later that evening he outlined his plan for you to murder the Leader ? 302 is silent . He blinks into the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hears only the lamp humming.Would you like your , memory refreshed ? 302 quivers as though struck by a whip:It did n't happen that evening , but next morning . RUBASHOV to GLETKIN:I believe the defendant has the right to ask questions . p. 115 GLETKIN fiercely:You have no rights here ! He leans forward to make some notations , and after a brief pause , without looking up.Go ahead ! Ask your questions . RUBASHOV rises , steps toward 302 , very gently:Now , Joseph , if I remember correctly , your father received the Order of Lenin the day after the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the Revolution . 302 whispers:Yes . RUBASHOV gently:So that is correct . If I again remember rightly , Joseph , you were with him at the time he received it . 302 nods.And as I recall it , the Order was presented at Moscow . Right , Joseph ? 302 nods . RUBASHOV pauses , turns to GLETKIN.Professor Kieffer took a midnight plane , and young Kieffer went with him . This alleged instigation to murder never took place , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , high in the clouds . The secretary 's pencil comes to a sudden standstill . She turns to GLETKIN. 302 , his face twisting with bewilderment and fear , also looks to GLETKIN . GLETKIN calmly:Have you any more questions ? p. 116 RUBASHOV That is all for the present . Sits . GLETKIN Now , Joseph  --  Rises , assumes RUBASHOV 's gentleness , even exaggerates it , crosses to 302.  --  did you leave with your father ? Or did you , in fact , join him later after your rendezvous with Rubashov ? 302 almost a sob of relief:After ! I joined my father later . GLETKIN In time to be with him for the presentation ? 302 Yes . Yes . GLETKIN nods , turns to RUBASHOV:Have you any more questions ? RUBASHOV No . GLETKIN turns to 302:You may go . 302 Thank you GLETKIN calls:Guard ! A uniformed GUARD enters and leads 302 out . At the door 302 turns his head once more to RUBASHOV . RUBASHOV meets 302 's imploring glance for a second , then turns away . Exit 302 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? p. 117 GLETKIN who has walked away , the full diameter of the room , turns , bellowing:What can be done to you ! And , with incredible speed for such a huge man , he hurls himself across the room , grabs RUBASHOV by the throat , and pulls him to his feet.We have many ways of making a man tell the truth . RUBASHOV quickly:Very well , what do you want me to sign ? GLETKIN relaxes his grip.If you torture me , I will sign anything you place before me . I will say anything you wish me to say at once . But tomorrow I will recant . At the public trial I 'll stand up in open court and I 'll cry out for all the world to hear , " They are drowning the Revolution in blood . Tyranny is afoot . She strides over our dead bodies . " You 've become quite pale . It would end your career , would n't it ? You hold me by the throat , young man , but I hold you by the throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make this so personal ? RUBASHOV Death , even in an impersonal cause , is a personal matter . Death and promotions . Sits . GLETKIN I am here only to serve the Party . I am nothing . He sits at the desk , gathering up his papers.The personal element in this case has been removed along with your friend Ivanoff. p. 118 RUBASHOV his face clouding , apprehensively:Removed ? GLETKIN There 'll be no partial confessions ; there 'll be no bargains . We promise you nothing . RUBASHOV What 's happened to Ivanoff ? GLETKIN Enemy of the people Ivanoff was executed early this morning . RUBASHOV after a long pause , nods to himself , murmurs:I see . Looks up at GLETKIN.Why ? Was it because of me ? GLETKIN Perhaps . RUBASHOV Perhaps he thought I was innocent . GLETKIN Then he should n't have conducted your investigation . RUBASHOV sighs heavily , murmurs:Go , Sascha . Go , in peace ! GLETKIN He was corrupt , like so many of your old guard , and his counterrevolutionary action in your examination RUBASHOV jumps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant young ass ! What the hell do you know about the Revolution or the old guard ? When you were peeing in your diapers , we were working and fighting and studying and writing one thing : Revolution ! Revolution ! Half our lives we lived like moles  --  underground ; we rotted away in every prison in Europe ; we knew poverty , we knew persecution , we knew starvation , but every living second we dreamed and built the Revolution with our blood and our bones ! And now you have the gall to sit there and  --  He waves his hand to the faded patches on the wall .  --  spit at these , the heroes of your boyhood ? Are you insane ? Do you really believe that we have all suddenly become venal and corrupt ? p. 119 GLETKIN leans forward , rising slowly , his face apoplectic:Quiet ! You washed-out , disgusting , rotten old man ! You did n't make the Revolution  --  the Revolution made you . You adventurers rode along , scum on the flood of the people 's uprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Leader ! He used you , because he had to use whatever was at hand , but he knew you were defective . That 's why our Leader has taken such pains with us . We have learned to recognize your defectiveness by the smell of you . You were needed for awhile , like the white-collared intelligentsia after the Revolution . But a new generation is at the helm now and your day is over . Understand ! There 'll be no bargains ! You , we offer nothing ! You are going to die ! The only question is whether you 'll die uselessly , or whether you will confess and perform a last service for the Party . But die you will , you understand ? RUBASHOV stares at him . Something dies ; something of the will , and the battle , and the spirit go out of RUBASHOV forever . He suddenly becomes a very tired , sick old man . He nods , whispers hoarsely:I understand . GLETKIN harshly , triumphant:Then let 's have no more arrogance . He pushes a button , picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as RUBASHOV slowly sits the scene vanishes . The lights come up on the tier of cells . We see 402 and the wraithlike 302 . They are eating their meager supper of black bread and cabbage soup . p. 120 302 taps to 402:Is Rubashov back yet ? 402 taps:No. 302 taps:How long ? 402 taps: They 've had him upstairs  --  it must be ten hours now . 302 taps : I wonder are they torturing him now . 402 taps: Why should they ? He 's confessed . 302 taps: They want more than that from him . 402 taps : What more is there ? 302 taps:There 's more . I hope he understood . I think he did . I looked into his eyes before I left . He seemed to understand . My father used to talk so well of him . Suddenly overcome , to himself. Oh , my father , my father ! 402 taps:Eat your supper . The lights fade and the prisoners vanish . The lights come up again , revealing the office . A new INTERROGATOR and SECRETARY have replaced GLETKIN and the YOUNG WOMAN . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple-faced , is standing over RUBASHOV , hammering away at him . On the verge of fainting from fatigue , white-faced as the ghosts that haunt him , RUBASHOV exerts every ounce of willpower to resist the fanatical onslaught . The SECRETARY is also washed out with fatigue , his hair in disarray , his tie loosened . p. 121 INTERROGATOR bellowing:Is this true ? Answer yes or no ! RUBASHOV I ca n't INTERROGATOR Yes or no ! RUBASHOV Partially INTERROGATOR harshly:Yes or no ! Yes or no ! RUBASHOV wearily:Yes . Yes . INTERROGATOR grunts:Yes . Good . Returns to the chair at the desk , seats himself.And now we return to the Kieffer episode . Picks up the documents.You admit this conversation with Professor Kieffer ? Pause . He glances up ; RUBASHOV 's eyes have closed ; his head , fallen , rests on his chest . The INTERROGATOR shouts.You will pay attention ! RUBASHOV opens his eyes , raises his head:What ? INTERROGATOR Do n't you feel well ? RUBASHOV I 'm all right . INTERROGATOR with quiet threat:Would you like me to call in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stand up ! RUBASHOV pulls himself to his feet.Straight ! Head up ! Hands at your sides ! At attention ! RUBASHOV obeys.Perhaps that will keep you awake . You admit this conversation ? Pause.Yes or no ! RUBASHOV There were conversations . INTERROGATOR I did n't ask you about conversations , I ask you about this one . RUBASHOV In Hegel 's philosophy , every yes has a no and every no has a yes . INTERROGATOR You 're not here as a philosopher , you 're here as a criminal . You 'd better not talk about Hegel 's philosophy . It 'd be better first of all for Hegel . Do you admit this conversation ? Yes or no . RUBASHOV Yes . The door opens , GLETKIN and his SECRETARY enter briskly . They are fresh and rested . She has changed her dress . GLETKIN carries an armful of books , with slips inserted . INTERROGATOR Yes . Good . RUBASHOV But I deny your conclusions . GLETKIN interrupting:That is to say you admit everything except the logical consequence of your admissions ? He nods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GLETKIN 's SECRETARY occupies the chair and proceeds to make notes . p. 123 INTERROGATOR Stop this crude lying ! RUBASHOV I 'm not lying , young man . GLETKIN crosses to the desk:You 've been here for ten hours poisoning the air with your Jesuit tactics . What do you expect to gain by this ? RUBASHOV Gain ? Nothing . GLETKIN touches the INTERROGATOR , who nods , rises:Then admit your crimes and get it over with ! RUBASHOV Admit to crimes I did n't commit ? Even Danton in the French Revolution was allowed to defend himself . INTERROGATOR now up out of the chair:And what happened to the French Revolution ? GLETKIN sliding into the seat , leaning across the desk , without interrupting the interrogation . The effect is of a well-oiled machine:Powdered pigtails declaiming about personal honor ! All that mattered to Danton and Company was to go with a swan song . Is that what you want ? The INTERROGATOR and the male SECRETARY exit , stretching , yawning wearily . RUBASHOV I certainly do n't want to go howling like a wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or harm to the Cause , that does n't matter ? RUBASHOV My whole life has but a single purpose : to serve the Cause . GLETKIN There 's only one way you can serve it now . A full confession in open court . A voluntary confession of all these crimes . RUBASHOV sways , leans on the desk to support himself:I 've pleaded guilty to a false and harmful policy . Is n't that enough ? GLETKIN Our country today is the bastion of the new era . Everything depends on our keeping the bastion intact , keeping the country solidly united . RUBASHOV How does it unite the country ? How does it serve the Party that her members have to grovel in the dust ? The name N. S. Rubashov is a piece of Party history . By dragging me in the mud you besmirch the Revolution . I  --  GLETKIN I , I , me , me , I ! He picks up one of the books , opening it to a marked page.Do you recognize this book ? RUBASHOV puts on his glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus his vision as he peers at the book:Yes . GLETKIN Who wrote it ? p. 125 RUBASHOV I did . GLETKIN reads from the page : " With us the objective result is everything . With us objective good faith is of no interest . Those who prove wrong will pay ! " You said that ? RUBASHOV his body sags again:Yes . GLETKIN Well , you are wrong . The ghostlike image of RICHARD appears , pointing a finger at RUBASHOV . RUBASHOV staring into space , nods:Yes . GLETKIN And you will pay . The phantom of RICHARD vanishes . RUBASHOV I am paying . GLETKIN With your life ! RUBASHOV My life has been the Party . My life would be worthless unless I could go on working for it . His knees buckle , he sways , about to collapse . GLETKIN Sit down ! RUBASHOV sinks to the chair.There 's only one way you can serve the Party now . As an example to the masses . He opens another book , reading from it . " For the masses , what is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black as pitch . " You wrote that ? p. 126 RUBASHOV Yes . GLETKIN Even if we let you go on living  --  as you say  --  what would you have to live for ? RUBASHOV to himself:Nothing . A man without a country . The ghostly image of LUIGI appears , smiling , gesticulating.Like little Luigi . GLETKIN Who ? LUIGI 's phantom vanishes . RUBASHOV shakes his head:Never mind . GLETKIN You admit your guilt ? RUBASHOV In thought . GLETKIN In thought ? Holds up a book.And this ? RUBASHOV Yes . Mine too . GLETKIN reads : " The consequences of our thinking will be felt unto the seventh generation . Hence a wrong thought from us is more criminal than a wrong deed from others . " You wrote that ? RUBASHOV Yes . I wrote it . GLETKIN Then , when you say you are not guilty , are n't you thinking mechanistically , Citizen Rubashov ? ALBERT 's image appears . He is waving his hands with the ridiculously exaggerated gestures . PABLO 's image appears , juggling plates . RUBASHOV laughs softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phantoms of PABLO and ALBERT vanish . RUBASHOV startled , looks up:Was I laughing ? GLETKIN Yes . RUBASHOV passes his hand over his forehead:I was n't conscious of it . GLETKIN Do you usually do things you 're not conscious of ? RUBASHOV No . Not often . GLETKIN These acts of sabotage , for example . RUBASHOV I deny them . GLETKIN Perhaps you committed them unconsciously . RUBASHOV I did n't commit them at all . GLETKIN These factories had great losses . RUBASHOV Yes . GLETKIN Sabotage is a weapon of the class struggle . RUBASHOV Yes . But I did n't employ it . GLETKIN You 've advocated its use again and again ? RUBASHOV Yes . But I did n't employ it here . GLETKIN Did n't you ? Pause . He looks through the papers.The case of the woman Luba Loshenko . She was your secretary ? Correct ? p. 128 RUBASHOV Yes . GLETKIN And you were sleeping with her . RUBASHOV straightens up.Correct ? Silence.Shall I give you the place , dates , conversations ? He waves the dossier.They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . GLETKIN Speak up ! RUBASHOV loudly:Yes . I admit the relationship . GLETKIN You admit it ? RUBASHOV I said yes . GLETKIN She was tried and shot for sabotage , correct ? RUBASHOV wildly:She was innocent . GLETKIN Innocent ? He rises . RUBASHOV Yes . GLETKIN She had no political motives ? Is that what you mean ? RUBASHOV Precisely . GLETKIN Precisely . She was an ordinary young woman , infatuated  --  blindly , stupidly , the slave and tool of one man who , however , did have considerable political motives  --  you ! p. 129 RUBASHOV What motives ? GLETKIN You hated the Revolution , and you taught her to hate us . RUBASHOV desperately:That 's not true . She was innocent . GLETKIN Why did n't you say so at the time ? RUBASHOV You know as well as I there was n't anything I could do to save her . GLETKIN So you did nothing ? RUBASHOV Nothing . GLETKIN You were silent . RUBASHOV I was silent . GLETKIN To save your own neck ! RUBASHOV To go on working . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to save your own neck . And this silence of yours was finally responsible for her execution . Correct ? RUBASHOV So I was informed . GLETKIN For your further information , I was one of her interrogators . RUBASHOV raises his head:You ? GLETKIN thumbs through the transcript:I have here a transcript of her interrogation . I think it might interest you . Ninth day . Tenth day . Yes , here we have it . This Loshenko woman was surprising . These thin delicate ones sometimes really stand up . Listen ! He reads . " Interrogator : Under whose orders ? Loshensko : No one 's " LUBA 's image appears in space , bowed , drenched with pain . She shakes her head slowly , moving her lips silently at first , then her trembling voice becomes barely audible , grows stronger , finally topping and supplanting GLETKIN 's voice . GLETKIN continues to read from the transcript . p. 130 LUBA No one 's . I 've told you a hundred times there were no orders . GLETKIN Stop lying . LUBA No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God ! I 'm so tired . GLETKIN I want the truth . LUBA I 've told you the truth , over and over and over and over . I 'm so tired , I ca n't GLETKIN Who gave you these instructions ? LUBA No one . GLETKIN You sabotaged without instructions ? LUBA No , no , no . You 're twisting my words . GLETKIN That 's what you said . LUBA I did n't say that ! I said I did n't do these things and no one asked me to . GLETKIN We 've all the proofs . LUBA What are you trying to make me say ? GLETKIN Stop shielding Rubashov ! LUBA I 'm not shielding anyone . GLETKIN You 're shielding Rubashov . LUBA A man like that does n't need shielding . A man like that p. 131 GLETKIN You were sleeping with him , were n't you ? LUBA I loved him . GLETKIN You loved him ? LUBA Yes . GLETKIN You 'd do anything he asked you ? LUBA He would n't ask me to commit crimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! GLETKIN He 's made a fool of you . LUBA No ! GLETKIN And now when you need him , where is he ? Where is he ? LUBA Oh , God , God , make them leave me alone ! GLETKIN God is dead , Luba Loshenko ! God is dead . LUBA What do you want of me ? GLETKIN Rubashov 's making you responsible for his guilt . LUBA He 's not . GLETKIN Use your head ! He 's refused to testify for you . LUBA I do n't believe that . GLETKIN Here are the proofs ! Look , look ! LUBA I do n't want to look . p. 132 GLETKIN He was asked to testify and he 's refused . LUBA I do n't believe that . I do n't believe you I do n't believe you . RUBASHOV staring into space , murmurs:I had no choice , Luba . Do n't you see ? I had no choice . I could n't have saved you . It was only a trap to destroy my usefulness . The SECRETARY rises , leans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried ! I went everywhere  --  to my friends in high places . They said no , nothing will help . GLETKIN reads on:Save yourself ! This is your last chance , Luba Loshenko ! You admit these acts of sabotage . LUBA I ca n't admit them because there were n't any . There was no sabotage . There were only tired men and sick men and frightened men . GLETKIN slaps his hand as he reads:You stupid bitch ! LUBA 's IMAGE recoils as if she 'd been struck.All right ! Then you 'll be shot in the back of your neck ! LUBA What are you doing to us ? What are you doing to us ? We 're not stones , we 're not machines ! We 're human beings . We feel , we think , we see , we dream , we 're a part of God . Why have you done this to us ? You say God is dead , but you 've made your own god out of darkness , out of misery and lies and pain ! Why ? Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up unsteadily , staring into space , calls out:This was not the way it was to be . GLETKIN glances quickly at RUBASHOV who is no longer aware of his surroundings , nods to the SECRETARY . She rises and leans closer to RUBASHOV , taking down his words . LUBA You 've made a prison out of our wonderful country  --  a prison . RUBASHOV We wanted to build a new and better world . LUBA You 've put chains on our people . Chains . In their hearts , inside their skulls . Why ? Why ? RUBASHOV I do n't understand why , myself . Our principles were right . LUBA Our people are more miserable than before the Revolution . RUBASHOV We dignosed the disease , but wherever we applied the healing knife LUBA Our people are covered with sores . RUBASHOV Our will was pure . We should have been loved by the people LUBA They hate you . RUBASHOV Why ? Why are we so hated ? We brought truth . LUBA In your mouths everything becomes a lie . p. 134 RUBASHOV We brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUBASHOV I sang of hope . LUBA Your tongues stammer and bark . RUBASHOV Yes , yes , and every premise of unimpeachable truth has led me to this final weird and ghostly game . Why ? Why ? LUBA Kolya ! Kolya , darling ! Wherever you are She vanishes and only her voice is heard crying " Kolya ! Kolya ! " RUBASHOV Luba ! Luba ! What have I done ? What have I done ? He whispers.Guilty , guilty , guilty ! Then , very simply.I 'm going to faint . He slides gently and quietly out of the chair and falls to the floor . GLETKIN rings for his colleague , snaps his fingers at his SECRETARY:The ammonia ! The SECRETARY rushes across to the table , opens a drawer , takes out a bottle of ammonia and hands it to him . GLETKIN , on one knee , slaps RUBASHOV 's face and administers the restorative . The door is thrown open and the other INTERROGATOR enters . GLETKIN nods , indicating RUBASHOV 's crumpled body:We 've got him . We 've got the lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUBASHOV.Stand him up ! The other INTERROGATOR lifts RUBASHOV to his feet and holds him there , limp as a rag doll . GLETKIN waves the ammonia bottle under his nose until he responds , then , putting one huge hand gently on his shoulder , speaks softly , caressingly.You have n't eaten your food today , Comrade Rubashov . Would you like some hot soup ? p. 135 RUBASHOV murmurs:Sleep . I must sleep . GLETKIN You understand , Comrade Rubashov , what the Party expects of you . RUBASHOV Yes . GLETKIN This is the last service you can perform for the Party . RUBASHOV I must sleep . Sleep . GLETKIN Very well . To GUARD.Take him back to his cell . To RUBASHOV , gently.I 'll see that you are not disturbed . RUBASHOV like a child , eagerly:Thank you , Comrade Gletkin . The GUARD takes RUBASHOV out . GLETKIN to the INTERROGATOR:In exactly twenty minutes wake him up and bring him back here . I 'll interrogate him till midnight , you take him till five A.M. , and I 'll take him again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  that 's the lever . Work it around in his belly . Keep returning to it . It 's simply a question of time now . The INTERROGATOR nods , feels his aching back , and goes , yawning . GLETKIN snaps off the dazzle-light . SECRETARY Congratulations , Comrade Gletkin. p. 136 GLETKIN sits down to his desk , stretches his legs , pleased:It 's just a matter of constitution . The scene fades out . The lights come up . The Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. This scene is another memory in the mind of the brooding RUBASHOV after the event has occurred . The PRESIDENT , bathed in a hot white light , is seated at a long , covered table , three judges to his left , three to his right . The rest are shadowy figures . PRESIDENT Comrade Judges , you have heard the evidence against Citizen Rubashov . Comrade Procurateur of the U.S.S.R. has summed up for the prosecution . Accused Rubashov step forward . RUBASHOV appears in the white light before the judge 's bench . The GUARD brings on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his last plea . RUBASHOV bending a little , speaking into the microphone , in a dead voice:Citizen Judges . Covered with shame , trampled in the dust , about to die  --  let me serve my final purpose . Let my horrible story demonstrate how the slightest deflection from the Party line must inevitably drag one down into counter-revolutionary banditry . If I ask myself today : " For what am I dying ? " I am confronted by absolute nothingness . Therefore , on the threshold of my final hour , I bend my knees to my country and to my people . The political masquerade is over . We were dead long before the Public Prosecutor demanded our heads . With this my task is ended . I have paid my debts . To ask for mercy would be derision . You must hate me , and you must kill me ! I have nothing more to say . He stands with lowered head . The GUARD removes the microphone . p. 137 PRESIDENT I will announce the sentence of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collegium of the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. sentences N. S. Rubashov to the supreme penalty  --  to be shot , with the confiscation of all his personal property " His voice trails off . The lights fade . The court vanishes . Only RUBASHOV remains , sitting in his cell , wrapped in meditation , his head between his hands , his brow furrowed , his face old and gray , as if all the blood had been drained out of him . An insistent tapping . 402 comes into view , tapping three times , waiting , and gently repeating the code . RUBASHOV coming out of his reverie , rises feebly , crosses unsteadily to the wall , taps:Yes ? 402 taps : I thought 302 behaved quite well . He went like a brave man . RUBASHOV taps:Yes. 402 taps: You still have about ten minutes . What are you doing ? RUBASHOV taps : I 'm thinking . 402 taps:Thinking 's bad . You wo n't show the white feather ! We know you 're a man . A man . Pause.Do you still remember " Breasts fit champagne glasses " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RUBASHOV listens for a sound from the corridor . 402 senses his thoughts.Do n't listen . I 'll tell you in time when they are coming . Pause.What would you do if you were pardoned ? p. 138 RUBASHOV thinks , taps : I 'd study astronomy . 402 taps:Ha ! Ha ! Me too , perhaps . But they say other stars are perhaps also inhabited . That would spoil it . Pause.May I give you some advice ? RUBASHOV taps:Yes. 402 taps:But do n't take it wrong . Technical suggestion of an old soldier . Empty your bladder . Is always better in such case . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . Ha ! Ha ! RUBASHOV smiles , taps:Thanks . Pause . 402 taps: Why astronomy ? RUBASHOV taps:As a boy I loved to watch the stars . I wanted to solve the riddle of the universe . 402 taps: Why ? Talk to me . RUBASHOV to himself:Recently I read they have discovered the Universe is finite . Forty years pass and I read that . If the Public Prosecutor has asked , " Defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have been able to answer . Perhaps there is my real guilt . p. 139 402 taps:It 's too late to worry about guilt . RUBASHOV taps:How can I die till I find out what I 'm dying for ? Pause , taps.Sorry ! Tell me , what are your prospects ? 402 taps slowly:Eighteen years more . Not quite . Only six thousand five hundred thirty days . Pause.Think of it . Another six thousand five hundred thirty days without a woman . I envy you , really . My brain is turning to water . I have returned to the habits of my childhood . I loathe myself ! RUBASHOV to the wall:Oh , you poor , poor devil ! To the entire prison , to all Russia.All of you ! My hundred and eighty million fellow prisoners , what have I done to you ? What have I created ? If History is all calculation , Rubashov , give me the sum of a hundred and eighty million nightmares . Quickly calculate me the pressure of a hundred and eighty million cravings . Where in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very beginning you forgot what you were searching for ? Footsteps ring out in the corridor . 402 taps: They 're coming . The footsteps grow louder.What a shame . We were having such a pleasant talk . p. 140 RUBASHOV taps: You 've helped me a lot . Thanks . 402 taps:Farewell . I envy you , I envy you . The door of RUBASHOV 's cell is thrown open with a clang . GLETKIN enters . GLETKIN Enemy of the People Nicolai Semonovitch Rubashov , before you are executed , have you any last wish ? A long pause . RUBASHOV One . He tries to catch GLETKIN 's eyes.If I could only make you understand where in the very beginning we failed . GLETKIN These are your last words . Do n't waste them . RUBASHOV passionately:You do n't build a Paradise out of concrete . My son GLETKIN quickly , distastefully:I am not your son . RUBASHOV after a long pause , sadly:Yes , you are . That 's the horror . He shakes his head , bitterly.The means have become the end ; and darkness has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RUBASHOV To die . GLETKIN motions him to walk . RUBASHOV moves slowly out of the cell ; GLETKIN takes out his pistol , cocks it , and follows . The GUARD opens the gate to the cellar , a shaft of light coming up catches them . 402 begins to drum on the door . From all over the prison comes the hollow muffled drumming , which mounts higher and higher as RUBASHOV and GLETKIN descend , and the iron gate clangs behind them . The drumming reaches a climax as the CURTAIN falls slowly .
