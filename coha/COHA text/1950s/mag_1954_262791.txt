In the dangerous underground struggle against the Nazis in World War II , a patriotic Norwegian cop named Asbjoern Brhyn worked with and came to like a tall , pale young Communist named Asbjoern Sunde . Sunde ran the Red underground mercilessly and effectively , never flinching at robbery , murders or bombings . He had already served his Communist apprenticeship as a courier in the Comintern maritime service and as a volunteer in the Spanish civil war . After the war , Communist Sunde became something of a hero for his underground activities , and his memoirs , Men in Darkness , became a bestseller . Then , inevitably , the two Asbjoerns drifted apart . <P> One day last month , B. S. Meshchevitinov , the Soviet Union 's young cultural attache in Norway , jammed his belongings into grips and caught the overnight express to Stockholm . He got away just in time . The next day , Inspector Asbjoern Brhyn of the Norwegian security police announced that Meshchevitinov had been Russian contact for the biggest spy ring ever unearthed in Norway . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine to isolated and regular rendezvous near the capital . There he had been met by a tall , pale man who supplied the Russian with a complete file of Norway 's secret military publication , the license numbers of its secret-police cars , lists of military equipment arriving from the U.S. , and quantities of phony passports for use by other Red agents . <P> Russia 's liaison man got away , but last week all twelve Norwegians in the spy ring were in jail awaiting trial . Heading them all , said Inspector Brhyn , was his old comrade in the underground , Asbjoern Sunde . Old Comrade Sunde , hard as nails , said only : " I 'm not talking at all . You have to prove everything . "
