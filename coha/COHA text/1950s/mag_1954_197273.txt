The Roseland State Ballroom in Bos ton 's Back Bay , just down the street from Symphony Hall , was jumping last week . <P> It was jumping higher than Bostomans had seen in a long while . Cause : the mambo a dance named ( some claim ) from a slang word used by Cuban sugar cane workers meaning " shake it . " The Boston crowd ( 1,140 Paid admissions ) was shaking it with glee . So were the bright-sleeved musicians on the band stand and their round-faced , sleepy-eyed leader Perez Prado , self-confessed inventor of the mambo . In his dress suit and stiff shirt Prado never even blinked at the deafening brass screeches that threatened to shatter the red neon tubes framing the ceiling . Only 50-odd couples actually danced and of them only a hard core of eight couples were in full mambo frenzy . Easily the champs of the evening were a shapely blonde Boston housewife named Adele Winters and her dark-haired part ner They did dizzy mambo variations known as chases , double turns , rolls , shine breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have been jolted by a high-voltage wire , hips writhing , arms swinging . Exhausted , Adele turned to light a cigarette , but the music shrieked louder , her partner yelled Come on ! , " and she stepped back into the beat as if she had never stopped . <P> On the sidelines stood her shirtsleeved young husband . Truck Driver Pete Win ters . " I 've been trying to learn it , sighed , " but I ca n't seem to . " <P> Comes the Evolution . Such scenes can be found almost any night of the week across the U.S. But most people still feel like Pete Winters , and nobody is quite sure just what the mambo is . It combines the subtle trickery of the Latin with the simplicity of a society-band beat . It takes the basic pulse away from the percussion section and gives it to the saxes , and features a socking four-beat rhythm ( often whacked out on a cowbell ) . Said one Boston onlooker : " It 's more graceful than jitterbugging , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . It 's greater than the Charleston , greater than swing . <P> According to one theory , mambo is an inevitable phase of cultural evolution , a resounding response to a major need Explains Darwin-minded Reporter Ed Wallace in the New York World-Telegram and Sun : " The rumba broke up the crowd of doleful listeners who had begun to accumulate like barnacles around the bandstand ; it got people back on the dance floor . ' The rumba came along just as dancers were becoming listeners . Then , when the kick of the rumba was beginning to wane , along came the mambo and eeuugghh ! we 're gone again . " <P> Mambo syncopations were ticking in Cuban Bandleader Prado 's head as long ago as 1942. and he wrote them into arrangements for local bands . Six years later in Mexico , he formed his own band , and the mambo beat began to catch on . Prado 's flair for the wild style-something like that of Stan Kenton 's modernist crew - sold him with the jazz buffs and his insistent rhythm with the dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical and semitropical countries ( Philippines President Ramon Magsaysay called it a " national calamity " ) before it seeped into the U.S. YANKS DIG THAT MAMBO BEAT , Variety 's front page announced last June . It ran like quicksilver through the brassier ballrooms , and even rolled into such tony spots as Manhattan s Waldorf-Astoria.
