The wage theories of big-league baseball players have always been as uncomplicated as the appetite of Oliver Twist . What they want is more . What they will get , announced Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick last week , is exactly that . For the privilege of broadcasting the next five years All-Star and World Series games on radio and television , NBC has promised to pay a whopping $16,250,000 . And , since 60% of the profits is already earmarked for the nine-year-old Annuity and Insurance Plan , retirement benefits for retired baseballers may soon jump to $300 , perhaps as high as $500 , a month . Today , men with ten years service in the majors can look forward to $100 . <P> Artist &; Asset . Such promise of security has not long been a part of the game . In a solemn and scholarly study published this week ( The Baseball Player ; Public Affairs Press ; $3.75 ) , the University of Alabama 's Economics Professor Paul M. <P> Gregory does his academic best to analyze the major-leaguer , to understand him both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The measure of Professor Gregory 's success is that his hero remains a baseball player , a big man playing a boy 's game , an economic pawn hemmed in by a code of law that is " like an old lady 's will amended by a maze of codicils . " <P> For all his criticism of the code-with its reserve clause , its waiver rule , its draft , which all hamper the individual 's bargaining power-Professor Gregory feels that baseball would die without it . " As a sport , " he says , " baseball , like the Army , must be authoritarian , with a definite chain of command . " That players have improved their status so steadily is a tribute to their stubborn pursuit of the dollar and the support of their fans , which has given baseball " a significance quite out of proportion to its size . " <P> Gift of Gab . Time was when pro ballplayers were " tobacco-chewing rowdies " who ran out their brief careers with little to show for their days on the diamond . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first big-league team of all , only Shortstop George Wright went on to become a successful businessman ( Wright &; Ditson , sporting goods ) . The rest stayed only a pitch or two ahead of the bill collectors . One died in a San Fran cisco poorhouse ; sentimental fans saved another from a pauper 's grave . Growing prestige , says Professor Gregory , has opened a new world of post-retirement opportunities for the once-forgotten ballplayer . So many of them have turned to radio and television sportscasting* that the good professor concludes : " Old players never die , they just gab away . " <P> To the ballplayers ' credit , they have also slowly learned to gab in their own behalf while still in uniform . Though they have never really joined organized labor-four separate unions have flopped , and they have never managed a successful strike-each team has its player representative . If trivial requests have failed ( one Philadelphia muscleman thought dugout benches needed foam-rubber cushions ) , earnest efforts to improve conditions have built the pension system and boosted minimum salaries to $6,000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
