The best news stories do n't end when they are written and read . At the least , they are conversation-starters ; at most , the stories themselves provide the impetus for a new chain of events . Here are some recent examples that grew out of stories in TIME : <P> Last September , Dr. Woodson W. Fishback of Southern Illinois University began to train school board members for the responsibilities of their jobs , and TIME reported his activities on Jan. 26 . <P> His project , said TIME , " was beginning to look like a small significant landmark in U.S. education . " <P> Ever since the story appeared , the " landmark " has been looming larger . Dr. Fishback has heard from people in 25 states and Alaska , most of them wanting more information and help in getting similar projects started in their own communities .

A hospital administration consultant in Indiana thought Fishback 's methods could be extended to hospital boards ; a Texas social worker suggested it might be used for public welfare boards ; and an Illinois minister asked : " How about setting up a board like that for my church ? " Wrote one abashed board member : " Having been on the school board for about 20 years , I believe it is high time to know more about the job one is supposed to do conscientiously . " <P> When Paramount Pictures ' production head , Don Hartman , first told Songwriter Irving Berlin that Rosemary Clooney was to be cast in the top feminine role of White Christmas , Berlin , believing the part should have been filled by an established movie star , gave only dubious assent . But recently Hartman heard from Berlin , calling excitedly from Miami Beach . Said Berlin : " I thought you ought to know I 'm very glad we have her in our picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the expectations you had for her and that she 's already taking on stature and importance . " Then the composer explained his change of heart : " I have a copy of TIME here , and I 'm very excited by the cover and article on Rosemary Clooney TIME , Feb. 23 . " <P> The Tucson , Ariz .
