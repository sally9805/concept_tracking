BATTLE OF INDOCHINA Victory Is Where You Make It <P> Said General Jean Gilles : " We only pray they will attack us . " The commander of Nasan waved his hand around the encircled battlefield : the dusty mile-long airstrip and the score of 500-ft. hills around it . Every hill and every valley was a network of barbed wire and dug-in strong points ; with its 12,000 French troops , air-supplied by a constant shuttle of planes , Nasan was like a military anthill . French officers likened it to the classic French position at Verdun , the great turning-point battle of World War I. <P> No Enemy . Three times the Viet Minh Communists attacked and retreated , leaving 3,000 dead on the wire . The French , whose strategy is based on the principle that the Viet Minh can not take heavy losses , were jubilant . On Christmas Eve the French broke out a force of 5,000 men to the southeast , linked up with Viet Nam paratroopers dropped near the Black River . Instead of meeting expected opposition , the French found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman : " Nasan is no longer besieged . . . We have recovered the initiative in the Thai country . " As the French saw it , the battle of Nasan was a resounding local victory . <P> But Communist General Giap was not wasting time licking his Nasan wounds . Part of his forces had pulled out for a three-week rest north of the Hanoi delta , while others 1 ) captured Dien Bien airport and garrison , 65 miles west of Nasan ; 2 ) ambushed a detachment of Moroccans retreating from Laichau and then encircled the old Thai capital ; 3 ) forced the French to abandon Phong Tho , 35 miles north of Laichau ; 4 ) moved south to the borders of Laos . Giap 's most serious effort was a two-division attack ( 20,000 men ) on the flooded area around Phat Diem , only 62 miles south of Hanoi . The French replied by moving in . three mobile groups ( each comparable to a U.S. regimental combat team ) , supported by French navy units . In a wide encircling movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bamboo-screened village . <P> Got You . Foreign Legionnaires led the attack but were forced to retreat across the paddies under withering machine-gun and mortar fire . In their second attack , the legionnaires got in among them with bayonets and grenades . The fight went on behind the cactus hedges and straw huts , with fanatical young Communists in brown homespun clothing shouting " La dai " ( Come and get us ) . The legionnaires got them . On the river , naval units sank six barges full of Viet Minh soldiers and equipment . Four-star General Raoul Sa-lan , who has been consistently chipper , even on the eve of past setbacks , boasted : " The future of our military actions is now secured . "
