Tourists visiting Niagara Falls will see something besides water and mist this summer . Last week work began on the biggest international hydroelectric project in history : a $157 million construction job which will divert part of the Niagara River 's water around the falls , shoot it through a 5-mile tunnel bored in solid rock 300 feet below the heart of Niagara Falls , Ont. , and into a giant penstock to create 600,000 h.p. of electricity for fast-growing southern Ontario . The project , not to be confused with the much-debated St. Lawrence seaway , was approved in a treaty signed between the U.S. and Canada last year .
