" At the time of making a picture , " says Painter Hans Hofmann , 71 , " I want not to know what I 'm doing ; a picture should be made with feeling , not with knowing . . . A shape can be sad or gay , a line delirious . " <P> Hofmann 's latest paintings , sad , gay and delirious , were on display last week in a Manhattan gallery . Drunken trapezoids in blinding reds and blues lurched against whirling , multicolored backgrounds . Blobs of oil streaked across canvases like Technicolor comets , leaving woozy hexagons and rectangles in their wake . <P> Hofmann likes bare canvas . To him it is " a perfect expression of 100% volume . " But he rips into the plain white with a bull-like energy . One slashing stroke or bright blob deserves another . Each changes the nature of the canvas , and therefore the strategy of attack . Hofmann describes the process as creating " push and pull on the picture surf ace . " He insists it is no child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rhythmic sense . " <P> More &; more modern painters and critics agree with Hofmann , revere him as the dean of a fast-growing school of U.S. abstractionists . Such leading lights of the school as Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell snub nature , keep their eyes on the canvas and paint nothings like fury . <P> Hofmann himself still gets a lot of his ideas from the things he sees around him . But he admits that his most ambitious works are mainly creations of his own imagination . " Canvases from nature I produce very fast , " says Hofmann . " Ones from the imagination take a long time .
