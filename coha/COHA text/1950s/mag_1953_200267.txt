On a bulletin board at northern Idaho 's 69-year-old Morning Mine , one of the biggest U.S. lead and zinc producers , appeared a mournful notice : " Due to increased costs of labor and supplies , diminishing ore reserves and low metal prices , the Morning Mine will be closed permanently . . . " <P> The closing , which threw some 250 miners out of work , was the latest casualty in the industry . In the lead and zinc areas of Utah , Missouri , Kansas and Oklahoma , mining communities are turning into ghost towns . Such companies as American Zinc , Lead and Smelting Co. were laying off refinery employees by the hundreds . Mining employment , which averaged 21,000 in 1947 , is down to 14,000 and still dropping ; production of lead is off almost 20% from last year , and the output of zinc ( usually found with lead ) has dropped still further . <P> Paradoxically , the mining slump has come at a time when U.S. industry is using zinc at a record rate ( an estimated 1,100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade below the 1950 peak of 1,200,000 tons . But U.S. mines have not benefited ; low-priced imports , up sharply in the last few years , exceed U.S. production ( see chart ) . - <P> Much of the foreign competition was spurred by the U.S. Government itself , which gave long-term contracts to producers abroad to insure a big enough supply for the Korean war.and the rearmament program . As foreign mines stepped up production and defense demands tapered , prices started down . Lead has dropped from 19 a Ib. in the spring of 1952 to 13 ; zinc has fallen even more sharply , from 19 t010 . At current low prices , U.S. mines simply can not compete with foreign producers . Up to 70% of U.S. mine costs are in labor , at an average $16 a day . In North Africa and South America , mine labor gets $1.50 to $2 a day ; in Mexico , from 85 to $4 . With such an advantage , foreign producers have little trouble leaping the modest U.S. tariff wall of less than a penny a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold hearings to see what can be done about the slump . Most of the mine owners want a higher tariff . They argue that lead and zinc mining are essential to U.S. defense , that in time of war foreign supplies might be cut off . But that is not a strong argument , since more than 75% of zinc and 50% of lead imports come from Canada and Mexico . In any case , the Tariff Commission can only boost the tariff by about a cent a Ib. ; what the miners want is a sliding scale that would push tariffs up as prices fall , something that only Congress can enact . <P> Congress has already rejected one such measure . But the industry is in such a critical state now that Congress will have to make a more basic decision : whether the nation 's lead and zinc mining industry is more-or less-essential than the Administration 's goal of lower tariffs and freer trade .
