TO get the complete story of General Thomas Dresser White required that TIME talk at length to the Air Force generals who make plans and decisions for White 's global striking force . But fast-moving airmen are not always easy to corner . The Washington Bureau 's Edwin Rees was lucky enough to catch White on the ground , persuaded Mrs. White to order him home early from his office one afternoon , interviewed the general over the bowl of oyster stew that Mrs. White had prepared for him . The Los Angeles Bureau 's John Koffend flew to SAC headquarters in Omaha to talk with SAC Commander Thomas S. Power , discovered that Power had just flown in from Washington , was set to fly out to Europe , was too busy to see him .
