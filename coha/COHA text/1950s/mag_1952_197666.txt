Parisian news photographers , Montparnasse salesgirls and , above all , thousands of confident , confiding children agreed as one that benevolent old Adrien Claude was the best Father Christmas that Paris had ever seen . His flowing white beard and the kindness that danced in his twinkling blue eyes were as genuine as those of the legendary Christmas saint himself . When Adrien made his appearance last year in the toy department of one of the biggest department stores on the Left Bank , children left the firm grip of parental hands with a shout of joy to clamber into his lap , pull his beard and whisper their hopes into his ear .

He went up to his chilly garret apartment , put his cat outside the door , sealed the windows tight and put his shoes by the fireplace , where all good French children put their shoes on Christmas Eve , hoping they will be filled by Father Christmas .
