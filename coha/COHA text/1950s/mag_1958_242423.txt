For five of the most furious , fantastic days and nights in New York 's political history , Democratic leaders in Buffalo fought , shoved , shouted and wept-and came perilously close to kicking away their campaign before it even got started . With Governor Averell Harriman an uncontested shoo-in for renomination , the brawl came on the nomination of a candidate for the U.S. Senate . The ultimate nominee : New York County 's five-term District Attorney Frank Hogan , 56 . The real winner in the party fracas : New York County 's Tammany Hall Boss Carmine De Sapio , after a polished display of professional power politics . The clear loser : Averell Harriman , after a surprisingly amateurish performance . <P> Remarkably , in his attempt to dictate the senatorial nomination , Harriman was licked before he began-and almost everybody knew it but Ave . His inability to grasp the political facts of life kept the convention fight raging for days in hotel corridors , suites and lobbies . The log of one of the wildest of all New York political conventions : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four fellow New York City borough bosses arrived in Buffalo with their minds made up . Their Senate candidate was soft , savvy D.A . Hogan , a Roman Catholic ( for ticket-balancing purposes ) and a pro 's pro . Indeed , De Sapio had been making approving sounds about Hogan ever since March . Among his main reasons : Hogan is far from being one of the A.D.A.-type liberals who , De Sapio thinks , have long been getting more political plums than their vote production is worth . And , as opposed to a liberal darling , a Hogan on the next New York delegation to a national convention would make it easier for De Sapio to deal with Southerners for whatever he can get . <P> Averell Harriman felt just the opposite . Himself a dedicated liberal , Harriman also felt beholden to New York 's Liberal Party for the 264,000 votes that it gave him in his 11,000 win in 1954 . The Liberal Party 's candidate , and Harriman 's , was onetime ( 1950-53 ) Air Force Secretary Thomas K. Finletter , able lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the polls . <P> The Convention-Eve Scramble . On convention eve , Averell Harriman declared a " free and open convention , " added ( with complete truth ) : " It is a fiction that I am going to dominate the convention . " At the same time , realizing that De Sapio &; Co. could not be persuaded to accept Finletter , Harriman switched his major effort to Thomas Murray , onetime Atomic Energy commissioner , and generally classified as a little less to the Democratic left than Tom Finletter . <P> Carmine De Sapio and the borough bosses already controlled about 600 votes , with only 572 needed to nominate their candidate . That being so , they would have none of Tom Murray . But De Sapio was willing to try to avoid an open , party-fracturing break with Harriman . Efforts to find a compromise candidate inevitably turned to New York City 's Mayor Robert Wagner , popular in the city and upstate with both the liberal amateurs and the professionals .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
