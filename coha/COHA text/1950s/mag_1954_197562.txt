STATE and local political organizations generally work harder to elect a governor than a Congressman , and for good reason . A governor can dispense far more patronage , let more contracts and do more favors than can any U.S. Congressman or Senator , a fact that leads to the philosophy : " Protect the barn-the hell with the com fields . " In last week 's elections the Democratic Party did much better than the G.O.P in protecting the barn . The Democrats elected governors in seven states that had been controlled by the G.O.P. : Pennsylvania , New York , Minnesota , Connecticut , Colorado , Arizona and New Mexico ( they had taken Maine two months before ) . <P> The reasons for the stronger Democratic showing on governors than on Senators were mostly local or personal . One national factor was that Eisenhower 's popularity is even less transferable to G.O.P. candidates for governorships than for Congress . Voters who saw a certain element of logic in the President 's appeal for a Republican Congress saw no reason why Ike needed Republican governors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact that they controlled a majority of governorships . <P> In addition to New York 's Harriman and Pennsylvania 's Leader ( see Pennsylvania ) , some notable victories were : <P> In Connecticut , 44-year-old Abraham A. Ribicoff upset Republican Governor John Lodge by a margin of only 2,800 votes of some 936,000 cast . Democrat Ribicoff , who will be the first Jewish governor in New England history , was elected to the Connecticut house of representatives in 1938 . He was elected to Congress in 1948 , re-elected in 1950 . In 1952 he tried for the U.S. Senate , was a victim of the Eisenhower landslide . In this year 's campaign , Ribicoff said " Nowhere except in the Democratic Party could a boy named Abe Ribicoff be nominated for governor in this state . " In a TV appearance the week before the election , Ribicoff made an American Dream speech in which he recalled how , as a boy , he would " walk through fields heavy with the smell of summer growth , lie under a tree and dream . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrity , could aspire to any position in American life and reach any heights regardless of race , creed or color . " This appeal had its effect . More effective , perhaps , was the fact that Lodge had angered some powerful G.O.P. county leaders . <P> In Minnesota , Democratic-Farmer-Labor Candidate Orville Freeman was elected governor in 1954 by being Senator Hubert Humphrey 's campaign manager in 1948 . Since his election , Humphrey has built a large and loyal following . This year Freeman swept in on Humphrey 's coattails , beating Republican Incumbent C. Elmer Anderson by 42,000 votes . Freeman , an eager young liberal , is only 36 . During the 1952 Democratic National Convention , Freeman fought hard and noisily to throw out the Virginia , South Carolina and Louisiana delegations over the party-loyalty resolution . Televiewers will remember him as an excited young man who stood atop his chair sputtering " point of order , point of order , " while Sam Rayburn gaveled him down .                @ @ @ @ @
