THE INCREDIBLE KRUPPS ( 308 pp. ) - Norbert Muhlen-Holt ( $5 ) . <P> Cusins : What on earth is the true faith of an Armorer ? <P> Undershaft : To give arms to all men who offer an honest price for them , without respect of persons or principles : to aristocrat and republican , to Nihilist and Tsar , to Capitalist and Socialist . . . all faiths , all follies , all causes and all crimes. - Bernard Shaw 's Major Barbara <P> During the Thirty Years ' War , a Krupp sold guns to Protestant and Catholic alike , and from that day to the end of World War II the family was rarely false to the Shavian armorer 's creed . The blood-and-iron saga of Kruppdom , including its rise from the ashes of World Wars I and II , is an intrinsically fascinating story . Unfortunately the drama is often dulled by German-born Author Norbert Muhlen 's drab style . But he livens his chronicle with a series of personality sketches of the lonely , driven eccentrics who lorded it over the steelworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at love . <P> Alchemistic Search . The initial secret of the Krupp success was failure . The founder of modern Kruppdom , Friedrich , was a turn-of-the-19th-century dreamer , prophetically dedicated to an industrialized Germany . He spent his life in a quasi-alchemistic search for " the secret of casting steel , " processed more irony than iron in his foundry , the Forge of Good Hope , and died at 39 of dropsy and despair . His son Alfred was later to find and filch the sought-for secret from British forgemasters while posing as a frivolous visiting baron , Herr Schropp . After he set the Essen smokestacks belching , Alfred devoted seven years to casting a cannon in steel instead of the traditional bronze ; the weapon later pulverized the French in the six-month war of 1870 . <P> As befitted a king of cannonry , Alfred built a palace ( the Villa Huegel ) , a monstrous Victorian pile of 160 rooms . To avoid drafts , the windows were permanently sealed . Alfred 's own den was built over the stables , as he believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Generalregulativ , a book of rules that established the Fuehrerprinzip at Krupp 's a good half century before der Fuehrer . Alfred dictated his workers ' lives down to prescribing their off-duty shoes ( wooden clogs ) . His wife took 25 years of the same niggling , then fled . When he died , Alfred left behind him more than 30,000 interoffice memos . <P> Senile Ghost . Alfred 's son Fritz was a pudgy , gourmandizing sybarite , who fattened Kruppdom by gobbling up coal and iron mines and the shipyards at Kiel . But his chief bequest was " the Capri scandal . " There , in a Tiberian grotto , guarded by boys garbed as Franciscan friars , he staged Black Masses and homosexual orgies . When his wife protested , he had her locked up as insane . Just when the whole affair broke in the German press , Fritz suffered a fatal stroke and was eulogized by Kaiser Wilhelm II in a state funeral .                    @
