No man can serve two masters . <P> - Matthew 6:24 <P> The Communist party has long since been exposed as a secret conspiracy whose followers can not give loyalty to any other master . In 1952 nobody should therefore deny the right of a newspaper to fire an employee who is a Communist . The American Newspaper Guild ; having fought hard to fire Communists from its own paid jobs , could scarcely deny it . Nevertheless , last week the Guild found itself upholding the fantastic claim that a newspaper publisher has no right ( let alone duty ) to rid himself of Communist writers . <P> In Los Angeles , an impartial arbitrator had just decided that the fuzzily liberal tabloid Daily News had acted properly in firing Rewriteman Vern Partlow , and in refusing to rehire Movie Reviewer Darr Smith . Both men had been named by former Communists testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee as their onetime fellow members . Both men had refused to say under oath if they were , or had been Communists . The News 's Executive Editor Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a rehiring list . <P> But News President Robert Smith soon made it plain that he was as concerned with a practical fear of possible " business " boycotts as he was with moral principles . Conceding that Partlow was an able employee who had never " slanted " his copy . Smith &; aides promised Partlow his job back if only he would swear that the charges were not true . <P> Then the Guild brought the weird charge that the dismissals violated its contract with the News because no " sufficient cause " was given for dismissal . It also cited a state labor clause forbidding dismissal for " political beliefs . " Arbitrator Paul A. Dodd , dean of Letters and Science at U.C.L.A. , ruled that nobody had proved Partlow or Smith a Communist , and that anyway , that was not the issue . Dodd got to the heart of the matter : " A newspaper has . . . a quasi-public responsibility . . . In view of our nation 's struggle today against the forces of Communism throughout the world , all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready to stand up and answer the Communist charges . . . The management of a newspaper has a right to expect its employees who are so accused to answer these charges . . . This both men refused to do . " <P> In spite of the obvious fairness of Dodd 's decision , the Los Angeles Guild stuck to its anachronistic view that because the national Guild 's constitution ( written in 1933 ) specifically forbids any discrimination for political beliefs in admitting members , the Guild must therefore defend members fired for political reasons . President Smith might have done better to stand on a clear-cut principle , rather than the argument that Communists damage the paper " businesswise. "
