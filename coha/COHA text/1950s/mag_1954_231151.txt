If ever the nation gets a chance to hear he voice of the U.S. public-school teacher , it seldom hears it so clearly as when the powerful ( 561,708 members ) National Education Association holds its annual convention . Last week , as some 20,000 teachers and administrators wound up their N.E.A. convention business in Manhattan , they did so with the well-earned satisfaction of having given the country a piece of their mind . <P> In sessions at Madison Square Garden and in meetings at midtown hotels , they talked about everything from juvenile delinquency to audio-visual aids . They elected a sprightly new president-Miss Waurine Walker of the Texas Education Agency-heard such notables as Mayor Robert Wagner and U.N . Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold . But for the most part , the effect of the convention was to remind the public once again that it was far from performing its proper duty towards the public schools . <P> Increase Expected . The physical condition of U.S. schools , reported N.E.A. 's Executive Secretary William Carr , is " steadily worsening . " There is a shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of overcrowding has reached such proportions that " a million children will be on half-day next year . . . <P> And the end , " continued Carr , " is not yet . <P> We must expect an increase of about one and a quarter million children each year for the next decade . This calls for a new classroom every 15 minutes , day and night , for 365 days a year . . . Thousands of children go to school day after day in unsuitable and dangerous buildings , are taught by underpaid and undertrained teachers on half-time shifts . " If all that were not enough , said Superintendent Martin Essex of Lakewood , Ohio , teachers are being frightened into a " sterile education . " After questioning 522 other superintendents for a special report , Essex found a growing fear of such subjects as religion , sex education , Communism , " socialized " medicine and UNESCO . " The American teacher has voluntarily censored herself . This is out of fear of reprisals . . . It 's not bad to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Retreat Denied . Rightly or wrongly , a group of N.E.A. 's teachers also made it obvio that they had little patience with such critics as Historian Arthur ( Educational Wastelands Bestor and Albert ( Quackery in the Public Schools Lynd . <P> In one convention session , John K. Norton of Columbia 's Teachers College apparently spoke for the majority when he lashed back at those who believe that the " new education " is leading the nation into an intellectual retreat . " I make no apology , " said he , " for bringing interest into educational method ... I also offer no apology for the belief that modern education should have purposes which take account of social as well as individual needs . " Having stated their complaints , the teachers proceeded to state some positions . <P> Among the convention 's major resolutions : Federal aid to the various states to raise teachers ' salaries . <P> A record salary scale of $4,000 for beginners with a bachelor 's degree , at least $9,000 for experienced ( over 15 years ) teachers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court 's decision to outlaw segregation in the public schools .
