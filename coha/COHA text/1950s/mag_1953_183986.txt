To one of his pupils in his Paris school , Pierre Larousse was a " small , dumpy man , his beard unkempt , his eyes sparkling-an introverted , sinister plodder strongly suspected of subversive ideas . " But subversive or not , Pierre Larousse had one idea for which France has long been grateful . " I want , " he announced in 1863 , " to teach everyone everything . " <P> Last week , 78 years after his death , old Pierre was still teaching . The great publishing house he founded had just put out a supplement to its six-volume Larousse du XXe Sicle , and by doing so , it had brought up to date France 's foremost dictionary-encyclopedia . Today the Larousse books are the final popular arbiters for French words : nine out of ten Frenchmen know them , and eight out of ten families own either the one-volume Petit Larousse ( 1,800 pages , 70,000 words and articles ) , the two-volume Nouveau Larousse Universel ( 2,176 pages , 138,423 words and articles ) , or the definitive dictionary itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , with the new supplement , scholars and plain citizens could find out what has happened to their language-and their world-since 1933 . <P> " Follow Me ! " In his own day , Pierre Larousse spent a lifetime preparing for his dictionary . The crotchety son of a hotelkeeper in Toucy , he moved to the Paris Latin Quarter just so he could study . Each morning for eight years , he would emerge from his dingy room , make a tour of lectures at the Sorbonne , the Collge de France , the Observatory , and then , after 6 , retire to the library to study some more . After a stint of teaching , he began writing textbooks on Latin , Greek , and French grammar , finally hit upon the idea of a dictionary-encyclopedia . Crouched behind his desk , he worked 16 hours a day , in 1865 issued his first 40-page weekly installment . " Subscribe , " said he . " or do not subscribe . Speak of me or do not speak of me .

He criticized the Roman Catholic Church ( which promptly put his work on the Index ) , denounced the Emperor Napoleon III ( " France . . . owes him an epitaph that could only be this : Napoleon the Last ! " ) , refused to admit that General Bonaparte had ever become an emperor at all . As far as Larousse was concerned , Bonaparte should have dropped dead " at the Chateau de St. Cloud , near Paris , the 18th Brumaire , Year VIII* of the French Republic , one and indivisible . " " Que Vous Etes Swing ! " Today Larousse no longer goes in for such acerbity , but in its own way , it still manages to mirror the changing spirit of France . Under angoisse ( anxiety ) , the new supplement quite naturally includes a discussion of existentialism ; under galit ( equality ) , it notes that the " preamble of the French Constitution of 1946 completes this principle . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Duel in the Sun " ) and Charles Chaplin , " the most authentic genius of the cinema .
