txt For the person seeking some gleam of light in the President 's gloomy budget figures for 1952 and 1953 , at least a meed of encouragement might be found in the fact that these figures represent the " bookkeeping " budget rather than the so-called " cash budget , " and that the latter offers a slightly more hopeful picture . The bookkeeping budget is an itemized estimate of the financial requirements of all branches of the Government for the ensuing year , together with an estimate of expected receipts . The cash budget includes all current cash payments to , and receipts from , the public . It is the sum , in other words , of all current cash transactions . Since the cash budget includes accumulated trust funds as spendable income it is , in our opinion , completely unsuited to the long-term purpose of budget reporting . However , for any given period it is useful as a check on the bookkeeping budget , especially from the standpoint of inflation . While the regular budget shows an estimated deficit for 1952 of $8.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by only $4 billions . Actually , it is proposed to let the Government 's cash balance run down by more than $3 billions , so the Treasury will have to resort to borrowing only in the amount of about $600 millions . But the Treasury can not reduce its working balance every year , so the 1953 prospect is a good deal less bright , even under this , the most favorable , method of measuring the deficit . With all due respect to the cash budget , conservative policy dictates that the Administration and the legislative branch keep their sights at all times on the regular budget . Those members of Congress are to be applauded , therefore , who have expressed their determination to challenge the " tightness " of the President 's 1953 budget , which contemplates ' the spending of the record peacetime sum of $85.4 billions . It is not to be defeatist , however , to recognize the fact that , big as the 1953 budget is , the task of whittling down the rate of spending at this juncture presents a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only seventy-four members of the House were on hand when the reading of the budget message began on Monday it may be necessary to build a strong fire under many of our legislators if any important results are to be hoped for . The importance of the return of the budget deficit lies in the fact that it introduces a new element of inflation into a situation which was already highly inflationary potentially . It therefore underscores the need for a re-examination of the nation 's inflation defense all along the line . In the light of our experience since Korea it is profitable to point out some of the typical holes that have been torn in these defenses by those who are supposed to lead the nation in the war on inflation . The President in the course of the last few days has embraced ( 1 ) the concept of stiff supports for farm prices , and ( 2 ) so-called " productivity " wage increases , both of which are thoroughly inflationary in their implications . The ( Second ) Wage Stabilization Board has been retreating slowly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clauses , productivity raises and fringe benefits , and up to now has shown little evidence of any intention to make a stand against the steady demands for higher wages . The President 's Council of Economic Advisers continues to support the Treasury in the latter 's inflationary demand for artificially low interest rates . ' 1- , ? reluctance of the members of Con- gress to place the nation 's fight against inflation above the demands of their constituents was painfully illustrated last summer in the insurrection against the Defense Production Act , typically exemplified by the Capehart Amendment to the price control regulations . A. more recent illustration was furnished by a demand by a leading Senator that the exemption of farm commodities from controls be liberalized by raising the " parity " test to " 110 per cent of parity . " At a time when the war against inflation requires the use of every available weapon it is hardly an exaggeration to say that proposals of the type mentioned come under the general head of , sabotage . It is equally obvious that so long as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of emotional energy to concentrate too greatly on the question of whether or not the budget is in balance .
