U.S. poetry was fizzing when Harriet Monroe of Chicago started Poetry magazine in 1912 . By opening her pages to some of the best young fizzers , she got some " firsts " to be proud of : T. S. Eliot 's Prufrock , Carl Sandburg 's Chicago , early verse by Ezra Pound , Wallace Stevens , Edna St. Vincent Millay . <P> The magazine became a haven for published and unpublished poets , regardless of poetic school . They could always pick up encouragement and , if necessary , a meal . And for 24 years , like an encouraging schoolteacher , Editor Monroe sat waiting for fresh geniuses to blow in . Her office was rarely dull ; nobody was much surprised when Vachel Lindsay appeared one day with a poem about King Solomon 's 400 wives , and led Editor Monroe through an improvised dance while he chanted it . <P> Poetry 's circulation has never risen much over 4,000 , and the magazine has never paid its own way . The editors have been able to solve this problem by buttonholing well-to-do well-wishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen Stevenson , ex-wife of Adlai Stevenson , herself an occasional contributor to Poetry . But over the years , editors have been confronted with another problem even graver : somewhere along the line , U.S. poetry ceased to fizz . <P> This week Poetry celebrates its 40th anniversary with an oversize , 95-page issue . Editor-Poet Karl Shapiro wrote his best contributors , asking for gems . Though the issue shines with famous names in contemporary poetry-W . H. Auden , E. E. Cummings , Marianne Moore , Wallace Stevens , William Carlos Williams-most of the gems are made of paste . <P> <P> Auden 's poem is probably the best of the lot : a description of " a plain without a feature , " where masses of men march to the command of a dictator and nobody knows " Of any world where promises were kept/Or one could weep because another wept . " But even this poem is all too predictable to anyone familiar with Auden 's work . Still more predictable are Marianne Moore spinning fine verbal webs , Wallace Stevens in a suavely elegiac mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the younger poets , most are earnestly prosy , weary beyond their years , and cautiously derivative . <P> Critics discussing the plight of poetry in the U.S. are prone to speak of the impatience of readers jaded by too much news and too much entertainment , of the callous indifference of editors , and of the fact that a lot of people who jump on modern poetry as obscure would also have trouble with Milton . Perhaps so . But a hard look at Poetry suggests that it is not only the philistinism of the public that is to blame . Poets can get away with many things , but not with dullness.
