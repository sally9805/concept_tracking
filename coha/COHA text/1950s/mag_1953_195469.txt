Has the " postwar period " ended at last ? Economically speaking , yes . <P> " The world economic situation has changed very radically , almost reversed itself , " World Bank President Eugene R. Black reported to the U.N . Economic and Social Council last week . " The postwar backlog of demand for goods and services in the industrialized countries has been in large part satisfied . And the critical shortages which plagued efforts to rebuild and expand industrial capacity have generally been overcome . Although inflationary pressures persist , inflation has to some extent subsided . . . " <P> <P> In the early days of the World Bank , the U.S. supplied virtually all the goods and money for reconstruction and development projects . Now Canada and Western Europe are providing equipment for new development projects , the proportion of nondollar loans made by the Bank is increasing , and the Bank has nearly $300 million in nondollar currencies available for future loans .                    @
