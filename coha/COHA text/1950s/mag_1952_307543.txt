THE FOLKS AT HOME ( 275 pp. ) - Margaret Halsey-Simon &; Schuster ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Margaret Halsey was 28 when her best-selling assault on the British way of life , With Malice Toward Some ( TIME , Aug. 28 , 1938 ) , swept her into realization of " the American Dream-the sudden , juicy , delicious , enthralling , entrancing , exhilarating acquisition of money . " " Between Sunday night and Monday morning " she became a well-to-do celebrity , all set to hurl herself into the " national pastime " of " having things nice . " " I had people in to dinner , and I had a maid to cook the dinner ... I got a divorce , which is standard . I went to a psychoanalyst-which is standard , too . " In a few more years , said her friends , Margaret would be safe in Hollywood 's bosom , having things nicer than ever . <P> The friends were wrong . Author Halsey was not ( as she herself well knew ) a professional writer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . While the lucky lucre trickled from her purse , her typewriter stood shrouded and mute . Melted soon were the impeccable makeup , the eye shadow and mascara of " gracious living . " Today Author Halsey is happily remarried and the mother of a four-year-old daughter . She is , by her own description , a middle-class mamma who " wears cotton shirts and blue jeans to everything but weddings , christenings and funerals . " She turns a deaf ear to the clang of falling shekels . Being well-to-do has convinced her that The Dream is pure nightmare . <P> Her new book is a dissertation on this theme . It wears much of the smooth make-up that made Malice a bestseller , with the difference that it reveals underneath a very agitated face . It is 100% American in that it is written with a high ideal in the right hand and a wisecrack in the left-each serving as something of an apology for the other . It is inspired by deep emotions which often result in intellectual pratfalls . <P> The average American , Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nation 's moral traditions , the American is still taught as a child " the Judeo-Christian ethic " of " yieldingness , generosity , sympathy , altruism , tenderness . " Then the morally instructed child grows into a businessman to whom " aggression , competitiveness and skepticism " are represented as the only ways of " being on the ball " and " going places . " During working hours , the businessman plays to the hilt the role of the " smooth operator . " Evenings and weekends , he attempts to revert to the honest , kindly role of principled Christian and loving father . <P> The result , says Author Halsey , is spiritual and psychological confusion . Aggressiveness " can not be eluded merely by putting on a hat and walking away . " When the businessman leaves his office , he takes with him a sinister self that has no place to go . At worst , he becomes savage and cynical ; at best , he swells the ranks of those who " smoke too much , eat too much , drink too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sleeping pills and drive too fast . "
