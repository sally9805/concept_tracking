The Metropolitan Opera faced an exhausting week . It began when the stagehands , who have worked for more than a year without a contract , failed to turn up for a rehearsal of Bellini 's Norma . Members of the office staff sweated over heavy props and managed to get some of the proper lights running . <P> Grimy and tieless , General Manager Rudolf Bing practiced with the heavy gold curtain , nearly clipped a couple of principal singers with a fast curtain at the end of Act I. The show , he panted , would go on that night without scenery if necessary . But before curtain time , the stagehands returned , and the evening 's opera , a well-tried Tannhuser , went smoothly . <P> Soprano Gamut . Next night came the company 's first Norma in nine years . Written in 1831 , Norma was one of the last of the bel canto operas , designed chiefly for vocal acrobatics . The scene is Gaul of the Druids ' day . Norma is a high priestess who has broken her vow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that he really loves a younger priestess . Much of the melody is limp as a drink of water and the harmonies have the simple severity of Stonehenge , but fastidious fans love it . <P> So do sopranos ; the name role has been tackled by the world 's top prima donnas from Giuditta Pasta ( who created it ) to Jenny Lind , Lilli Lehmann and Rosa Ponselle . Norma is on stage-and singing-for almost two hours , or long enough to satisfy the heartiest spotlight appetite . She ranges the emotional gamut from mother love to infanticide . Best of all , the part is almost impossible to sing , and few of today 's voices can both spin the intricate tracery of its high coloratura and belt out the chesty low tones . <P> <P> Celtic Brnnhilde . The Met 's Zinka Milanov is one of the few . Possessed of a voice unsurpassed nowadays for sheer beauty and warmth , Yugoslav Soprano Milanov has a controlling interest in the company 's dramatic Italian leads , i.e. , in Ada , Trovatore , Forza del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole season of preparation for the part , she appeared on stage looking something like a Celtic Brnnhilde . <P> Her first number was the opera 's famed Casta Diva ( Stainless Goddess ) , which , while not Norma 's most difficult number , is hardly a piece to warm up on . She threaded her way carefully but spiritedly through the opera 's complicated cadenzas with a generous use of her pearly pianissimo , came dramatically and vocally into her own in the second and third acts and at the end , despite signs of weariness ( she began to sing sharp ) , won a personal ovation . Most thrilling moments : her soaring duets with Mezzo-Soprano Fedora Barbieri . <P> When it was all over , Diva Milanov retired to her dressing room to munch an apple and then greet 100 or so admirers in relays of five . By 1 a.m. she was exhausted , but happily planning four more Normas in what is left of the season .                  @ @ @
