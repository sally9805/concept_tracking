On March 9 , 1953 , Mrs. Clarice Covert , an American citizen who had accompanied her U.S. Air Force husband on his assignment to Britain , told a psychiatrist that she was " just going to explode . " Next day she exploded : she hacked Master Sergeant Edward Covert to death with an ax as he lay sleeping in their Heyfort home . <P> Under a previous agreement with the U.S. applying to crimes by civilians with the U.S. Armed Forces , Britain had waived its right to try Clarice Covert in its civil courts . She was sentenced to life imprisonment by a U.S. Air Force court-martial which acted under a section in the 1950 Uniform Code of Military Justice giving jurisdiction to military tribunals over " all persons serving with , employed by or accompanying " the U.S. Armed Forces overseas . Last week in Washington , Federal District Judge Edward A. Tamm declared that section of the Uniform Code to be unconstitutional and ordered Mrs. Covert set free . <P> Legal Sanctuary ? Judge Tamm made his ruling on the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nov. 21 ) , in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that ex-servicemen can not be tried by court-martial for crimes committed while in the armed forces . If the military thus has no jurisdiction over civilians who were at one time in the service , said Judge Tamm , then the military obviously has no jurisdiction over " persons who were civilians all the time . " <P> Judge Tamm acknowledged the fact that his ruling , if upheld by higher courts , would cause major problems for the armed forces . It surely would . There are more than 265,000 dependents overseas with American servicemen , along with nearly 142,000 civilian employees of the armed forces . All these would seem to be placed in a sort of legal sanctuary by Judge Tamm 's projection of the Toth decision . The U.S. Bureau of Prisons estimates that the Tamm ruling could free at least 50 persons who , like Mrs. Covert , were civilians overseas with the armed forces and therefore beyond the reach of the U.S. civil courts at the time they committed their crimes .

Smith . <P> The Hand of the Thief ? As Government lawyers sat down last week to figure out their appeal from the Tamm decision and to consider the ruling 's possible effects , they developed more questions than answers . Among them : If U.S. military courts can not try civilians abroad , who can ? The U.S. may give back to the foreign countries which have surrendered it by treaty , jurisdiction over American civilians with its armed forces . But would such revision meet American standards of justice ? For example , should an American national be forced to stand trial before a French Communist judge ? Or should a U.S. citizen receive punishment under Islamic law ( in Saudi Arabia , the penalty for thievery is the hand of the thief ) ?
