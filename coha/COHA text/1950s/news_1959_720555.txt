txt James R. Hoffa stood by his convicted associates in the Teamsters Union under three hours of questioning by Senate ' investigators today . Apparently more confident than ever , the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters affirmed in loud voice the right of his union to elect anyone it pleased and to spend dues money for the defense of officers accused of crimes . He declared an uncompromising fight against " class legisla , tion " that would bar felons from union office . Employers with criminal records can sit across the bargaining table from teamsters , and men have walked out of jail and have been elected to Congress , he said . Mr. Hoffa showed less deference than ever to Robert F. Kennedy , chief , counsel of the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field . He showed not much more to Mr. Kennedy 's brother , Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of *Massachusetts , who accused him of putting out " a wholly inaccurate " analysis of the Kennedy labor reform bill that the Senate approved last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel , " I am not here to be ridiculed . " He accused Mr. Kennedy of taking a . Hof fa quotation out of context for headline-making purposes . The younger Mr. Kennedy and Edward Bennett Williams , the teamsters ' counsel , once personal friends , got into a verbal slugging match , which the chairman , Senator John L. ' McClellan , Democrat of Arkansas , terminated after a few sentences . Mr. Kennedy , referring to a statement made in Federal District Court by Mr. Williams , said , " This was a fraud on the court . " " Just a minute , " Mr. Williams interrupted . " When you start whipping around the word fraud I want to talk to . you about it . I want you to withdraw , Mr. Kennedy , that a fraud was perpetrated on the court . " Mr. McClellan tried to soften the impact of Mr. Kennedy 's remark , but Mr. Williams declared , " There 's no such thing as a good-faith fraud on the court . " The chairman said that it was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good faith and the court could still be the victim of fraud if the , lawyer 's source of information had knowingly given him false information . Mr. Williams thereupon did not press his demand for a retraction but said his source had been under a false impression and that when the inaccuracy was discovered the court was so informed . Use of Funds Debated The Kennedy-Williams argument dealt with the case of Glenn Smith and H. L. Boling , president and secretary-treasurer of a Chattanooga local- of the teamsters , who were involved hi the use of local union funds to get indictments quashed in a Tennessee court . Hoffa testified that he understood that Smith , who has an extensive criminal record , was on leave . This turned out to be correct , committee investigators testified , but Hoffa overlooked , or forgot , that he had written letters to Smith and Boling last August suspending them as officers of the local . Smith is on a six months ' , leave , starting last December , with pay in advance , and Bol ing is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the team- ' stern international office did not contain copies of the Hoffa letters telling Smith and Boling they were suspended . He obtained copies from the ? courtappointed monitors of the teamsters , he said . Pressed on Suspension ' The committee counsel then tried to find what Hoffa was going to do to make his suspension stick and to recover the salary paid to Smith during his leave . Hoffa explained that a board of eight members , headed by John T. O'Brien , an international vice president , had held a hearing on this case in Chattanooga but was withholding its recommendation until court actions involving Smith were resolved . Mr. Williams said that when he told the Federal court here in November that Smith and Boling had been suspended , all teamsters ' officials at the international level understood that to be the fact . " How they Smith and Boling circumvented the international I do not know , " the union counsel added . Hoffa , pressed for an answer on what he intended to do about enforcing the suspension and recovering money paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find why his suspension orders were not obeyed and that both men would be suspended until the eight-man investigating panel reported . Mr. Kennedy raised the same point about Sam Goldstein , who is drawing $20,800 a year in salary and expenses from a New York local though he is in Rikers Island Prison for bribery . Hoffa said the Goldstein case had not been brought to his attention , although Goldstein wars convicted in 1957 , pleaded guilty to another charge and has been in prison for more than three months . Mr. Kennedy then raised the Associated Pse.s Wirephoto James R. Hoffa testifying yesterday in Washington point that Mr. Hoffa had appointed his own commission to help him clean up the teamsters . One of the commission members is George H. Bender , former Republican Senator from Ohio , who was in the crowded hearing room earlier in the afternoon . A committee accountant , Carmine S. Bellino , testified that Mr. Bender has drawn $58,636 in salary and expenses from the teamsters since last August . Mr. Hoffa said the Bender commission was " inactive " now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the newspaper had been paying a local teamster official as a truck driver though he did little or no work . The union official disagreed . Charles R. Obermeyer , business manager of the Detroit Times , said that Joseph Prebenda showed up on Saturday night but was carried on the payroll regularly because " we want to avoid any trouble . " Mr. Obermeyer said the arrangement was terminated two days ago . He said Mr. Prebenda , secretary-treasurer of Local 372 , had been a Detroit Times employe since 1921 . He is 53 . Mr. Prebenda was the first of the pro-Hoffa teamster officials in this series of hearings to testify freely . He explained that the contract provided for a driver and a. jumper on each delivery truck . His brother is the jumper member of the team and often performer both functions , he said . Cites ' Same ' Work Dally But Mr. Prebenda insisted he did some work every day , such as " counting the money , making ' out the route slips , " - and similar chores . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was unable to say how much . He receives a union salary of $270 a week and $50 expenses . A committee investigator testified that the newspaper paid Mr. Prebenda $36,022 in wages in the last five years . Additional payments for a truck totaled $12,701 in that period . Mr. Prebenda said he had loaned Mr. Hoffa $2,000 about six years ago , and received no security or evidence of the loan , and had not been repaid . Through three New York witnesses , the committee sought to answer what Mr. Kennedy said was a common question : Why do n't the members get rid of undesirable officers ? Edward McCormick of the Bronx and Michael Clements of Brooklyn said a slate of candidates opposed to John Mc- , Namara , secretary-treasurer ofl teamsters ' Local 808 , won a ma- jority of seats on the union 's executive board last December . But , he said , they were not allowed to make motions and said he had no money to pay Mr. Clements as a business agent , the post to which he bad been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said it had recommended a run-off election in the case of 's disputed election , but that for the first time in the association 's history a recommendation had I not been followed . , whose extortion conviction recently was reversed . invoked the Fifth Amendment as a protection against possible self-incrimination . Similar pleas were entered by-John O'Rourke , chairman of the New York Joint Council of Teamsters , and William Presser , chairman of the Ohio Council of Teamsters.
