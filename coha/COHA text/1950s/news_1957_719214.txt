txt Burdette Hurls 7-Hit Shutoutin7th Game for His 3d Victory By JOHN DREBINGER Milwaukee , which less than five years ago did n't even boast a major league club , bestrides the baseball universe today . Manager Fred Haney 's Braves , playing inspired ball behind another brilliant pitching effort by their tireless Lew Burdette , ' smothered the supposedly invincible Yankees , 5 to 0 , in the seventh and deciding world series game at the Stadium yesterday . The victory , generously cheered by a gathering of 61 , - 207 as Burdette gained his third mound triumph of the classic , gave the National Leaguers the series , 4 games to 3 . It brought to Milwaukee a world championship in its first crack at the title . Inversely , it wound up a damaging campaign for New York . In little more than a month Old Gotham had lost two ball clubs , the Dodgers and Giants . Yesterday it was shorn of the world series crown it had held , with one or another of its three entries , since 1949 . Takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the third inning yesterday gave the Milwaukeans a stranglehold they never relinquished . There just was n't a thing the inexhaustible baseball brain of Casey Stengel could do about it . Haney , a one-time pint-sized infielder who was appearing in a world series for the first time , had Stengel licked from the start of the game . A costly error by Tony Kubek , rookie star of the Bombers during the earlier stages of the series , opened the gates for the Braves in the third . Before the inning was over , Don Larsen , Casey 's starting pitcher , had been put to rout . The big fellow , hero of last year 's epic perfect game against the Dodgers , had been carefully groomed for this one . But he could n't weather the punishment he took from both sides . Eddie Mathews unloaded a two-run two-bagger . Bobby Shantz replaced Larsen , but the Braves rolled on . Hank Aaron // and Wes Covington singled . Before the little Yankee southpaw could stem the tide , four runs were in and the American Leaguers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by way of giving his team additional security , Del Crandall , Burdette 's catcher , dropped a home run into the left-field stand in the eighth . But that shot was not needed . For by then one Selva Lewis Burdette Jr. , 30-year-old righthander and one-time farm hand in the Yankee chain , was putting the finishing touches to one of the most astounding exhibitions of sustained pitching mastery in ' more than a half-century of world series competition . Burdette vanquished the Yankees in the second game , 4 to 2 , last Thursday in New York . Last Monday in Milwaukee he shut them out , 1 to 0 , in the fifth game to put the Braves in front . Yesterday , with his second dazzling shutout after only two days of rest , he completed a stretch of twentyfour scoreless innings . In the twenty-seven innings of his three complete games he allowed only two runs . Only one hurler , perhaps the greatest of all , topped this . In 1905 , the immortal ' Christy Mathewson rolled up twentyseven innings of scoreless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** Winners Burdette yesterday became the seventh pitcher to gain three victories in a world series . The last was Harry Brecheen in 1946 . But the Cardinal southpaw gained one in a relief role . Four , besides Burdette , posted three complete-game victories . They were Mathewson , Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1910 , Babe Adams of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1909 and Stanley Coveleskie of Ithe Cleveland . Indians in 1920 . The only other pitcher to win three games was Urban Faber of the Chicago White Sox in 1917 . But in one of his triumphs he was removed for a relief hurler . For Milwaukee , of course , yesterday easily was the day of days . That metropolis , home of the brew , the Braves and the finest of cheeses , doubtless will remain in a daze for some time to come . Milwaukee entered the National League officially on March 18 , .1953 , when Owner Lou Perini moved his Braves from Boston . It was the first franchise shift in the senior league in more than half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athletics moved from Philadelphia to Kansas City , the Browns from St. Louis to Baltimore , where they became the Orioles , and next year will see the New York Giants playing in San Francisco and the Brooklyn Dodgers in Los Angeles . Four seasons of frustration followed the shift to Milwaukee . The Braves , despite a tremendous improvement from their sixth-place finish in Boston . were second in 1953 , third in 1954 , and second again the next two years . The 1956 season was the most bitter disappointment , for Haney 's men let the pennant slip away in the last few days . Sixth Yankee Setback For New York , defeat perhaps was not too difficult to take . Seventeen times in the past have the Yankees brought the title here . This was only their sixth series setback . For Stengel the defeat was only his second in his nine seasons as manager of the Bombers . He has been the winner six times . He fought hard to save this one . In desperation he even returned Mickey Mantle to action in a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shoulder injury after the fourth game and almost everyone thought he had made his last appearance save for a possible role as pinch-hitter . But there he was , out in center field , playing the entire game . He singled for one of the seven hits permitted by Burdette . Even Bill Skowron , out since the first game with a lame back , got into it in the closing innings . The Braves , on the other hand , played without their wounded . Red Schoendienst , crippled in the fifth game with a groin injury% remained on the sidelines . Warren Spahn sat it out in the bullpen . The ace lefty was to have hurled this game but had to be sidetracked because of a mild influenza attack on Wednesday . The incredible Burdette , however , needed no help once the Yankees let the game fall apart in the third inning . Larsen had just retired his mound adversary , Burdette , on a foul back of third for the first out in the fateful inning when Bob Hazle , a rookie outfielder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came a play that doubtless will remain seared in Stengel 's amazing memory through many a wintry night . Peg to Second Wide For the player who gummed it up had been the apple of Casey 's eye all season  --  the brilliant and versatile Kubek . Tony had started the series last week at third , then switched to left field and center when Mantle went out of action . With Mantle back in center , Tony was on third again and that 's where all the trouble started . Johnny Logan slammed a grounder at Kubek . It looked like a sure-fire double play . But Tony 's peg to second was wide . It pulled Jerry Coleman off the bag and there was no out there . Desperately , Jerry fired the ball to first in an effort to get at least one man . But Logan beat the throw and the Braves , instead of having been retired , had two on with one out . It reminded one of what Uncle Wilbert Robinson of early Brooklyn baseball vintage , once described as the " phantom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-bagger down the right-field foul line . Before the ball could be brought back to the infield both Hazle and Logan had scored . That was all for the crestfallen Larsen . Shantz went in . Aaron , one of the Braves ' top hitters in the series , punched a single into center and Mathews scored . Covington singled to left , sending Hank to third . Then when the Yanks failed to complete a double play by way of second base on Frank Torre 's grounder to Coleman , Aaron streaked home with the fourth tally . After that nothing really mattered as Burdette kept firing his bewildering assortment of screwballs , sliders. and sinkers . So perfect was his control he walked only one batter , and that was intentional . It came after Hank Bauer had opened the Yankee first inning by belting Burdette 's first pitch for a double . This gave Hank the distinction of having connected In fourteen consecutive games for a world series record . Bauer had hit in each of the seven games in last October 's classic . He topped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Schulte of the Cubs fifty years ago and Harry Hooper of the Red Sox of 1915 , 1916 and 1918 . To add luster to the record was the fact that the Yanks ' ex-Marine had compiled his mark in only two series . However , nothing else came ' of this blow even though there was a slight mix-up by the Braves on the next play . Enos Slaughter grounded to Burdette . This hung up Bauer between second and third . But the Brave inner defense did n't play well and Hank scrambled back to second . However , the situation still was saved for Milwaukee since by then Slaughter had ambled down to second and so was an easy out . Mantle , taking his first turn at bat since the tenth inning of the fourth game , then went out on a grounder to the mound . Yogi Berra was intentionally passed and Gil ended the inning with an infield pop-up . Following the four-run third , Art Ditmar and Tom Sturdivant held the Braves scoreless for two innings apiece and Tommy Byrne did well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two out and the bases empty , Byrne was guilty of one errant pitch . Crandall lifted it into the leftfield seats , the ball just going beyond Slaughter 's frantic reach . After the Yanks ' brief firstinning splurge , they did n't get a man on base until Coleman singled in the fifth . In the sixth the Bombers made another bid , which did n't get started until two were out . Here Mantle singled and Mathews fumbled Berra 's grounder . But then grounded to Mathews , who this time froze to the ball . Game to the end , the Bombers made a despairing effort to break through Burdette in the last of the ninth . With one away , singled . After Kubek flied out , Coleman outgalloped an infield tap for his second hit . Byrne then smashed a hard grounder over second base . It threatened to ruin Burdette 's shutout . But Felix Mantilla , again substituting at second for Schoendienst , threw himself headlong at the ball and blocked its path . It was a hit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a run . Skowron banged a sharp one-hopper down the third-base line . Mathews scooped it up , stepped on third and the series was over . A record attendance of 394 , - 712 was set for a seven-game series . This topped the former mark of 389,763 set by the Yankees and Dodgers in 1947 . The total receipts , exclusive of revenues from radio and television , reached $2,475,978 , also a record . But perhaps its greatest record was the bringing of the first world championship to Wha t could well develop into the most fanatic baseball center in me nation . At least it has given the newcomers , Los Angeles and San Francisco , something to ' shoot at . On March 15 , 1953 , when the prospect of Milwaukee getting the Braves ' franchise was still a rumor , a crowd of 15,000 , unmindful of wind and snow , gathered at Milwaukee 's Municipal . Stadium . They undoubtedly dreamed of the day when perhaps they might win a pennant and world series . Last night in that sizzling midwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braves ' team made history . That was when the " Miracle Braves " came out of the National League cellar on July 4 to win the pennant and then down the then formidable Athletics four straight in the world series . But that was out of Boston . Thirtynine years later Boston was to give up on the Braves . Now Milwaukee rules the roost . It will be many a year before they 'll forget the pitching of Lew Burdette.
