txt The Eisenhower Adminis , tration Inistled out a housing bill which Housing Administrator Albert Cole declared ' would " provide an . important stimulus to an upturn in the economy . " The measure , which Mr. : Cole said would be introduced in Congress today , was deemed a move by the White House to take the play , away from the Democrats ' housing bill . The Senate Banking Committee hopes to approve today a bill by Sen. Sparkman ( D. , Ala. ) , calling for a multi-billion - dollar program . Committee  --  aides freely labeled the Sparkman bill an , " anti-recession " measure . Under the prodding of Senate Majority Leader Johnson ( D. , Texas ) , the Sparkman bill has been assigned top priority .. Mr. Cole is slated to appear before the Banking Committe ' today . The Administration 's measure would : Start a six-year , $1,350,000,000 program for alum clearence and redevelopment under which the burden would gradually- be switched from the Government . Guarantee Private Loans Introduce a new ? program authorizing the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million to rehabilitate non-residential areas , " particularly declining downtown areas ; " Raise maximum Federal Housing Administration Mortgage Insurance on single family homes to $30,000 from the present $20,000 , and apply ? the upper limit also to cooperative housing , urban renewal sales housing , and military housing for essential civilian workers ; Boost the limit on mortgage* the Federal National Mortgage Association can buy to $20 , - 000 from the present $15,000 ; Let Fannie Mae quit buying special assist . ance mortgages , such as cooperative and military housing , at par ; Allow F.H.A. to insure mortgages for privately-financed rental projects built to relocate families displaced by urban renewal , highway construction or other Governmental action as well as those financed by public or non-profit institutions as at present ; Called for a " new program " to give further aid to colleges and other educational institutions to build student centers and other related facilities and housing for schools of nursing ? despite the fact Mr. Eisenhower in his budget called for the elimination of loans for student unions ; ? Give Federal guarantees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the present 2% interest rate limit oft housing loans to colleges and figure it on a formula based on the- yield on Government bonds comparable to college housing bonds ; Extend authority for military housing a year past the June , 1959 , expiration date and allow an interest ceiling of 5% on such mortgages instead of the present 4% ; and seek authority for F.H.A. to put a OM interest ceiling on mortgages for rental and multi-family salestype cooperative housing , instead of the preseit 4%% ; call for the elimination of discount controls ? on F.H.A-intfured loans ; permit F.H.A. to increase its outstanding insurance authority , now at about $25 billion , by $3 billion in any one year over the next five ; and authorize an additional $90 million to Fannie Mae for the buying of : mortgages for urban renewal and housing for elderly people . However , the bill did not contain a proposal . frequently referred to in recent , months by Mr. Cole and F.H.A. Commissioner Norm. = Mason , for the Government to insure the top 25% of the unpaid balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under this new plan , the lender would be able to set the interest rates , would do much of the processing of the mortgage application , but would take a share in any loss , no matter how small . The aim would be to prompt lenders to make bigger loans than they now make , with moderate down payments and help eliminate the necessity for second mortgages . The six-year program of Federal assistance for urban renewal , or slum clearance , would spread 31,350,000,000 of Government grants among states and cities at a decreasing rate . The Federal Government now makes loans and grants to help cities clear or prevent slums . Under the grants , the local authorities put up for each $2 Uncle Sam supplies . Beginning July 1 , 1959. however , the Federal Government 's participation would be cut to 60% , then 55% in fiscal 1961 and 50% from fiscal 1962 through 1964 . Ten-Year Loans Under the new urban renewal program , private loans would be made to local agencies for a 10-year period , but only after the completion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this : The local agencies would complete the project under temporary financing . These bonds would gradually be paid off by the revenue from the redeveloped property . The Government would guarantee repayment of these loans , but no more than $150 million of such guarantees could be outstanding at one time . Administration officials figure the Government guarantee will help local agencies get the temporary financing . The measure would raise the present $20,000 limit on F.H.A. insurance for mortgages on single and two-family homes to $30,000 . The limit would also go to $30,000 for  --  three-family homes , on which the present F.H.A. insurance ceiling is $27,000 . In addition , the bill raises the F.H.A. limit to $12,000 from $10,000 on low-cost private housing to relocate families displaced by urban renewal projects or other Governmental action . As in the President 's budget , the measure asks for another $200 million in direct college loan authorization , raising the total to more than $1.1 billion from $925 million . The Government would guarantee the taxable bonds of educational institutions issued to pay off these loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service on the bonds will be met and the lenders would be induced to take a more active part in this market .
