100And this late and somehow secret meal had been the best time of the day , the really intimate time when he and Persis talked quietly and enjoyed each other . Always then the night seemed to him to open like a flower , to give back the lost sense of time which all the affairs of the day interrupted . As long as the lights were on , it held a great sweetness . He loved to see Persis like this , a soft white cashmere shawl flung across one shoulder and her face without make-up touching in the extreme simplicity of its lines , an ageing , a wise face full of the purity of youth , and her eyes so deep and clear . How much they had laughed together ! How much they had had to say to each other , always ! Often it was one o'clock before he put the glasses back on the tray and turned out the light . What followed was his affair , not hers . In the dark on many nights he had lain awake till dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow , the perfect tranquillity of her breathing , her infinite remoteness . And worse , on the nights when , having clasped her in his arms , he knew that she was not there , had never been there for him . With an effort , Alan got up . It was time now , before his thoughts carried him any deeper into that misery and that fire , to go down to the room where he had not been for four days and nights . Very softly he went down the stairs , down through the intensely still house , surrounded by the intensely still night . I might be a ghost , he thought , half-amused , or a burglar for that matter . He opened the shut door and walked over to the windowswithout looking back . There he stood for some minutes , watching the halo of light around the street lamp and the thickfallingsnow , and one light high up in the house opposite . Then he drew the curtains and felt his way to the table between the 101beds . The light sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making every object fearfully distinct . Persis ' white shawl lay across the foot of the bed . His pajamas and slippers were laid out and his own bed turned down . From where he sat , he looked at the back of the silver frame which held Chabrier 's face . At least it would not haunt him again . He took it in his hands and looked at it one last time , startled by the resemblance to Francis as he had looked at the other end of the dining room table , smiling across at Alan . It was the face of a man both full of clarity and full of tension , with a deep line almost like a wound between the two eyebrows and it looked out with piercing intensity as if to say , " I 'm alive , not dead , believe me . " Or as if to say , " Even if I never finished my work , my life , I am here , not to be forgotten . " Tomorrow , Alan thought , I shall give this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes on the usual chair , his watch on the night-table . He noticed that there was phenobarbital by the bed and remembered saying so to Sukey long ago . It would be wise , no doubt , to take one . Insteadhe lay with the light on , his arms under his head , wide awake , as if he were waiting for someone and would not sleep before she came  --  came in from a party , perhaps , a party where he had refused to go preferring to work , came in all shining with the evening air , tossing her little fur cape on the bed , coming to kiss him and tease him and tell him all about it , to ask how his evening 's work had gone , to be charmingly malicious about the people she had just left , or more often to tell him , " I am worried about so and so , Alan . He 's working too hard , " or " Nancy is drinking too much . There must be something wrong. p 102I must ask her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do . " Or , with a delighted mischievous smile , " That old Mr. Bowers is a shocking flirt . You should have been there , darling , to protect me from his not very subtle advances . " Or " Alan , what do you think about treason ? How does the Pound prize compare with the stupid business about Gieseking ? Are we right to absolve art from political responsibility ? We talked about it for hours . I think we Americans are more savage , being less involved . The French are crowding the theatres to see De Montherlant 's plays  --  is that lack of moral values , or magnanimity or just curiosity ? " He was alone , but she was there , would always be there , he knew now . The dead do not die and one 's feeling for them never changes . Only the living change and die in oneself . So he began to understand about Chabrier and Chabrier 's power . Now in the last few days , by dying , Persis had separated him forever from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who act as pure entities beyond will or good and evil , for Persis had done all she could do to keep Alan 's feeling for his mother intact , admiring her vitality , praising her love for him , careful that Mrs. Bradford should often be included in their dinners or informal parties , always charming to her . But in dying she could not conceal the truth as she had when she was alive , putting a screen of words between him and it . And it was strange to come to admit as he did now , that he had in the deepest sense , not lost Persis , but had lost his mother . There is nothing better as a preservative he thought than a completely selfish life . Had his mother ever for a moment entertainedthe idea of guilt , blamed herself , even questioned her own motives ? Her delightfully smooth pink and white facep 103had never , it seemed , been furrowed and ploughed up by life . But Alan deliberately turned away from these thoughts , bitter thoughts . There was no point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient gesture , he turned off the light , but not before he had said to himself , " Whatever happens I am not going to live with her . " At first he had wanted to run away , leave this house , leave Persis ' clothes hanging in the cupboards , her books in the bookshelves , leave them all and never look back , become a wanderer on the earth if necessary , but never come back here , above all never again sleep in this empty room . But that was four days ago and in four days , he had grown old and very tired and in four days he had realized that he would always find Persis here , here and nowhere else . Instead of wishing to leave , he now felt that nothing on earth would ever make him leave , unless he should be forced to , unless Francis married . For how many nights had he lain like this in the dark , wide awake , in the last ten years ? Outside the snow fell , the silence fell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had remained to keep Persis and him apart was gone forever  --  that insurmountable wall of his passion for her . Now that she was dead , he possessed her at last , because he was free . Peace and love flowed in and soon Alan slept. p 107FRANCIS STOOD on the bridge , looking down at the olivecoloredSeine , then lifted his head as if to remind himself of what he could n't yet believe  --  this space all around him , these great perspectives , the soft gold of the Invalides Dome against the veiled blue sky , the immense square of the Concorde , and then turning back , his eye drawn down the green aisle of plane trees to the ancient island where the square towers of Notre Dame rose and stated the Eternal theme . It was as if for years he had n't known how to breathe and now he could breathe . He was not a tourist but a man come home from long exile , recognizing the powers in and all around him not as magical or strange , but his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green , all soft and shining , gently horizontal after the perpendicular Americancities . The evening before , at his arrival , it had been veiled in a hyacinthine light , damp that never became rain , but stayed suspended over lavender streets , and he had had the sensation of dreaming , of walking in sleep through what was remembered and strange , familiar and fresh . He had sat for a long time in ap 108bistro across the river from Notre Dame , drinking brandy , trying to sort out all the sensations . From there he had phoned Madame Bernard ; now he was on his way to see her . It was four o'clock in the afternoon on the tenth of June . His examinations were passed . He was through with all that , through with studying , through with the long suspense since December when everything focussed to a distant point , to the day and the hour when he would stand in this place , alone and free . But cities , like hearts , are haunted by human faces . The distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person was Solange Bernard . For the last months he had lived on her letters . He felt now that he knew her well , but his image of her was still a child 's image , and so he was afraid . He had been walking for an hour , unable to stay in his room , unable to concentrate , and yet held in a suspense so vivid that he thought he would never forget a single face he had met on his walk , nor a single shadow of a single tree , nor the wind blowingthe spray from the fountains in the Concorde , nor the massed clouds , the play of the sky for which the whole city seemed at times only a stage-set designed by genius . All his anxieties and troubles of the last months had been washed away one by one on the long dull sea-days when he had walked round the deck with Saul , hardly speaking . There on the boat he had been haunted by Ann 's face when they had said good-bye ; had imagined he was tearing up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her now . He had worried about Alan . He had worried about himself and what he was really coming for , had tried to prepare for disappointmentlike a man who has just bet his whole fortune on a horse and is sure suddenly that it wo n't win. p 109But Saul had almost persuaded him that all these doubts and fears were just the reaction to the strain of exams and of leaving . And it did seem that at some place in the middle of the Atlantic his mind turned from facing toward Boston and faced the other way . It was not a deliberate act , but an unconsciouschange brought on by the empty days , sleep , boredomand the steady throb of the motors that carried him to France . Now Saul had gone on to London for three weeks and would come to Paris later . They planned to find a flat and , if they could afford it , to hire a car , but all of this Francisfelt to be unreal , as nothing was real except Solange Bernard in whose single person he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself . Was this too great a burden to lay on one human being ? Can one expect so much , demand so much and receive more than a crumb ? Francis , looking down again at the water , so quiet it hardly seemed possible that it flowed , had an impulse not to go , to put it off another day , not to risk everything yet . For , he thought , whatever she may be , whatever happens , I am not prepared . And then he turned away from the questions and the great open perspectives and made his way into the familiar narrow streets where human dwellings rather than sky must provide the answers . Number eighteen Rue de 1'Universite was a vast door opening into a courtyard . The concierge directed him to the stairs at the opposite side and he glanced up once nervously at the windows on the second floor . Was he being watched ? Was he early ? Late ? He was filled with embarrassment , wonderedsuddenly if he would be able to speak French , wondered in perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110she would be disappointed : she would be looking for a person worthy of his father and his mother . But by then he was at the door . The bell tinkled very far off but he could hear no sound inside . When the door finally opened he was met by a fat Breughelesque servant who beamed and told him he was expected . At the end of the long dark hall he heard laughter , first a man 's deep loud laugh and then a lighter one , harsh and light . As if he were breaking open a world , Francis opened the door . At first he hardly saw her , confused by a roar of welcome from the old man who embraced him on both cheeks and shouted , " Francis ! Well , here he is , the prodigal child  --  let me look at you ! " and held him fast in two surprisingly strong hands and stared at him with laughing black eyes , his mouth open like an ogre 's , then turned to the woman lying on a chaise longue by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes . " " My poor dear , you will think us quite mad . Come here and kiss me and let me introduce you properly to Jean-Marie Fontanes , your father 's dear friend and mine . " Francis found himself kissing a cheek he had not yet looked at , aware of a smell of perfume , of a small brown hand cuffed in lace , clasping his warmly , and then of the room itself , rather dark , old-fashioned , he thought  --  formal , too . He found himselfsitting between them , commented upon , admired , teased ( " He 's terribly serious , Solange " ) until he had only one desire , to escape . He had never imagined that there might be a third at this meeting , especially such an overwhelming third as this old man . He must be someone important , Francis thought , trying to remember what his mother must have said about a personcalled Fontanes . " But you have n't even looked at me ! " The voice from the chaise longue accused him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used to being looked at . She expects to be looked at , in fact she demandsto be looked at , which is not a very subtle way of gettingpeoples ' attention , you know , Solange . " In the glance they exchanged of perfect intimacy , Francis had the opportunity at last to lift his eyes . The first thing he thought , with the cruelty of youth , was : she 's older than I imagined . The second thing was : she 's not beautiful at all . And the third was : what an extraordinary face . Her eyes looked brilliant blue for she had on a soft blue dress ; her nose , a sharp and delicate beak , a little too definite for beauty ; and her mouth , mischievous , subtle , changing every instant and showing very white almost wolfish teeth . All this sharpness , brilliance was casqued in quite gray hair . Francis thought , she 's like a gray fox , a little gray fox who 's always managed to escape the hunters and even laughed at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had foreseen . Here was no statue of poised beauty , no quiet shrine where he might find understanding and compassion . Here was a living human being , almost painfully alive . His glance , these thoughts , took a few seconds , but evidentlysomething in his expression changed , for Solange pounced on him ( this suddenness , this daring frankness he suddenly remembered ) , " Yes , you are young for your age and I am old for mine , little Francis . But we must try to fling a bridge across all the years , just the same , eh ? "  --  III  --  p 112Ever since he had come into this room he had felt attacked , prodded and now he lifted his head and looked at her full in the face with irritation . " In America we are taught not to make personal remarks and I am , after all , half American  --  you just bewilder me , both of you , " he said , smiling now because they looked so contrite , so surprised . " Solange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Francis with a complete change of tone . " Now , Francis , let 's be serious . Boston must be a very serious place . What is it like to come home after all these years ? " " It 's home , " Francis answered , " that 's all . " He could hardly tell these two strangers more than that . He was not going to pour himself out at their feet as they seemed to expect . But after tea was brought in and delicious little cakes , he found himself after all talking a great deal , describing the ferociousold maid who ran his pension , telling them about Saul , and finally about his own vague ideas about his future . Whatever his first glance at Solange had intimated , like a premonition , was now dissolved and forgotten as he relaxed ; by the time Fontanes rose to go , she had become , or so it seemed , an old friend . Almost he felt at ease here . " Now I 've found you , " Fontanes stood with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye , " I am going to hang onto you . You had better come and have dinner with me tomorrow night . Next week I 'm beginning a new play and sha n't have much time . All right ? That 's decided ? " Then he took Francis ' chin in his hand as if he had been a small boy and said , " It 's good that you 've come . We need you here , little one . " p 113 " What an extraordinary man ! " Francis turned to Solange as the door shut behind the elephantine figure . " Who is he ? " But even as he asked the obvious question and listened to Solange 's answer , the transition was as complete as when an aeroplane bumps along the earth on landing . At last they were alone . " Where to begin ? Fontanes was your father 's best friend . They were fellow officers in the ' 14 war , Fontanes in some sort of ground job and your father of course as an aviator . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Francis wandered about the room , picked up a silver snuffboxon a little table , opened it , shut it , put it back absently , then stopped by the desk to look at a row of photographs , his back to Solange . " The theatre director  --  you must have heard his name ! He is one of the pioneers of theatre in France . . . " Was he listening ? Apparently not , for Francis , taking a silver frame in his hands , sat down and said , " My mother . My mother as she was when you used to come to see us in the Rue de Vaugirard . She was beautiful , was n't she ? " " Beautiful , I do n't know . She was herself , something more than beauty  --  do n't you think beauty is rather overrated , in people , I mean ? " " I do n't know much about it . " The tone was so bitter that Solange smiled , " My dear , you sound like a man disappointed in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francis answered . " Ah ? " She caught his eye , looked at him half seriously , half mockingly , " You are a child . " p 114 " Yes , " said Francis as if he were confessing to a murder , had crossed half the world to confess to this woman that he was a murderer , " I am . " " Have some more tea , " she suggested irrelevantly . " You see , " Francis said frowning , with the effort , " I was always at war with my mother . I did n't know it until she died but now I see it . And it was a very absorbing war . There was hardly room for anything else . Now I only want peace . " " Why were you at war with her ? " Solange asked gently . " Because  --  because I suppose I wanted her to admit  --  to ad-mit ... " " That she loved you , yes . " Solange nodded her head as if she were thinking aloud . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What miserable creatures we are , even the best of us . What mistakes we make . How we hurt each other . . . " She lifted her face and looked out of the window as if she were saying a private prayer . " Always when you came it meant that I was sent upstairs , sent away , and even all those Jules Verne books and chocolates hardly made up for that , " he said wanting to bring her back from her thoughts toward him . " No , no more tea , thank you . I was frightfully jealous . Now when Fontanes left , it seemed strange that I could feel this relief to be with you , you who alwaysuntil now have been  --  well , what ?  --  1 suppose , a threat . " He laughed . " Well , now here we are . " " Yes , here we are . It is strange , Francis , you know . I shall have to get used to you little by little . " " Yes , " he frowned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very deliberately he got up and set the silver frame back on the desk. p 115 " I was expecting you . I 've been expecting you all these months , " she protested . " And now I 'm not here ? " he asked with an acute sense of his lack of everything she might admire . " I had not expected someone so alarming , " she hunted for each word , " savage  --  afraid . Why are you so afraid , Francis ? It is n't like your letters . " " Oh , letters , " he said brusquely , " you 're not like your letterseither . " " There , you see , that 's what I mean . Of course you are disappointed , but why say it so brutally , in such a tone of voice ? " she asked softly and almost impersonally . " It 's rather rude . " " But you 're alarming , too , " Francis said almost angrily , " I  --  I 'm not used to being talked to like this or talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconcerting . " He got up and walked up and down restlessly . He felt like picking up the little silver box and flinging it down on the floor . " Come here , " she commanded , " we are both being very foolish . Come and sit down on the end of my chair  --  there "  --  she pulled him down  --  " Now that 's better . I 've been clumsy . I felt I knew you so well we could just plunge in and be old friends . It was stupid of me . " But having granted so much , she attacked again , " But of course you ca n't have peace , not yet . You 've got to live , Francis . Good Heavens , how old are you to be talking of peace ? " " Twenty-six . " " Twenty-six , " she murmured , but whatever she thought she kept to herself this time . " Now , " she said firmly , " first of all we must plan about theatres and things . It 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , Claudel 's Partage du Midi , for instance . That you and I must see . " " Lesson number one ? " he asked ironically . " If you like , yes . " Francis had come to learn but he resented a little being put at once in the position of a pupil . Standing on the bridge on his way here he had been rather pleased with himself and the world . Now he felt like a cat whose fur has been rubbed the wrong way , ruffled and on edge . He got up rather clumsily and said he must be going . Now he wanted to escape , to get off by himself , to find his own Paris , to get away from those slightly mocking eyes that looked at him quizzically , critically . " I 've frightened you away , wild creature that you are . How like your father . He was such a sudden man and people often thought him rude . But he was also a dedicated man , he was always running away to work , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , but now he remembered his father . " He used to take me for walks in the Luxembourg Gardens . And then when we got there he would forget all about me , and begin to walk much too fast , not saying a word sometimes for half an hour . And then he would stop suddenly and make me look at a tree as if I had never seen one before . He would pick a leaf and show me how it was formed , make me feel the trunk with my hands . I loved him , but sometimes I got tired of always being taught something . I wanted to talk to him about my things . He was n't very human , was he ? " Francis asked , standing at the end of the chaise longue , looking down at Solange . " I think your mother made him human , and that was why he loved her . Tell me , Francis , before you go , " she said , taking p 117his hand absent-mindedly and looking at it , " what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question he had expected but it was a hard questionto answer ; his hand stiffened in hers so that he found he was clasping it . Startled , he withdrew , sat down again with the strange sensation that his hand had gone numb or been left behind in her small dry warm one , as if without meaning to , he had given a part of his physical self away . He was so disturbedthat he did n't answer for a moment and Solange went on , " Your mother wrote me when she married , wrote of his kindness and the great work he 's doing  --  a history of China , is n't it ? But he never seemed quite real to me . " " I think Alan is a very good person , " Francis said then . " Good ? What does that mean exactly ? " " Well , maybe that 's not the word , " Francis lit a cigarette , forgetting to offer her one and leaned forward intently . " Maybe I mean , pure . And it 's curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , the Near East , knows Europe well  --  but there is something in him that has remained absolutely itself , untouched  --  how can I say it ? You see , when he married my mother I think it was the first time he had ever really loved any-one . " " A man of fifty ? " " That shocks you , does it ? " Francis looked up and smiled . " No , it seems strange  --  " " Yes , I suppose it does . " " And you and he get on well , then ? In some way you are alike ... " " Heavens , no ! You see Alan is enormously gentle and understanding , " he said unconscious of the humor , or the self-p 118criticism implied , " I never knew him really . I just ignored him until Mother 's death . Since then we 've become friends . I 'm trying to persuade him to come over this summer . He needs to be distracted , to get away from his devil of a mother . " Solange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " " It seems to be a biological necessity , " Francis answered , laughing outright , a loud boyish laugh . " Oh , you do n't know how good it is to be here , to be able to talk like this . I feel as if I 'd been in a strait jacket for years . It will take me awhile to get used to this , to move about freely . Solange , " he said turning to her with simple conviction , " you do n't know , you ca n't know what it is to live among people who have no juice . And they 're all so terribly good , " he ended , " all except me . I have become a monster really . I 'm only half-human . You 've observed that , no doubt ? " he challenged her . " Perhaps , " but she refused to make a judgment , " you are a lot of things and people all at once and not one person yet  --  that 's my guess . But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she looked down , for the first time shy  --  " that it 's lovely to have you here , lovely that you 've come . Since Andre died I 've been a desert . But for Fontanes I should have died . " " Remote , withdrawn she seemed now as the moon , and at this moment of her drawing near to him with words , Francis felt that he could never reach her , that it was not for him to make this mysterious desert flower , though he wished devoutly that he could . He was silent . " Fontanes is a terrible friend , really , terrible and wonderful . He demands so much  --  you 'll see . He just wo n't listen to defeatism . He 'll fight you back into the front line inch by inch , if you try to run away . He can be cruel , can Fontanes . Well "  --  shep 119turned on Francis suddenly  --  " there is a man I would call pure , pure fire . " " Can fire be pure ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers or chemists not for poor women to answer . What do you think yourself , " she demanded , " you who have never been in love ? " " I think it has something to do with detachment . Mother was like that , you know . She helped people . She demanded a great deal too . " " Yes , " Solange sighed , " your mother was an angel . " The silence which had been in the air for the last half hour fell . Francis did n't dare move , did n't dare look at her . And all the time the silence kept growing like a balloon , softly growing and getting larger and larger until before it could burst , he got up and said , " Now I really must go . " When Solange lifted her head , he had gone . She saw him walk quickly across the court without looking up at the window . But once out of sight , Francis stopped , stood in the street without knowing where to turn . It was quite beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing his lost look offered to help him on his way . Only then he turned to the right and walked toward the Luxembourg Gardens . Once he stopped to look curiously at his right hand . Once he stopped for several minutes before a bookseller 's window , but he could not have named one title he had seen when he turned away . His mind was blazing and yet he had no thoughts . He was empty and full at the same time . He heard his own words repeated senselessly , " I have never been in love . I have never been in love . " And he ached with lone-liness. p 120SOLANGE HAD BEEN SO absorbed in trying to encompass and understand Francis that she had n't thought of herself in relation to him at all . In a way he was frightening , this young man with his shy piercing glance and his stubborn mouth , his air of passionatedisdain . Would she be able to help him ? At the moment she felt tired and old . And she was glad to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things by herself . Under her facade of charm and gaiety , Solange hid a deep melancholy , hidden from everyone but Fontanes . He knew that after her husband 's death she had been near to suicide for months . He had beaten her out of it , forced her to take a job reading manuscripts for Gallimard where he knew one of the editors . He had refused to pity her , had challenged her at every point of weakness . When he saw the traces of tears  --  for at one time she had fits of weeping which came on her like seizures in the Metro or walking in the street  --  when he found her weeping , Fontanes swore at her , even shook her physically like a child , would have none of it . His very simplicity acted like a tonic . It was impossible to fight Fon-p 121tanes , one had to give in , give in to being saved , to being pushed back into life . And , she thought gratefully , Fontanes will help this boy . He will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle facade , the little defensive attitudes  --  Oh , that air with which Francis had said , " I have never been in love " ! Was it true ? Or was that too a defense ? For a second he had looked disarmed , at a loss , and hating her for forcing him into a corner . Well , she had not meant to . And now she wondered if there were not some young girls to whom she might introduce him . He was certainly an excellent match and she thought it would please Persis if he married a French girl . Yes , that was it ! Solange felt relieved at the very idea , so relieved that she was startled . Was it really that she did n't like him  --  this puritanical young man who asked so much , with his violence , his self-pity , his self-absorption ? Thinking these harsh thoughts , she was taken aback when a messenger arrived with a spray of yellow orchids . The card said simply Francis Chabrier . She was touched . She was going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray dress . But the aptness of it , a flower arriving at just the right moment startled her . She had not expected this sort of thing from Francis at all . And she was embarrassed by Eugenie 's exclamations , as she held the delicate spray in her thick red hand . " Madame will be beautiful this evening . " " Hardly , Eugenie , " Solange answered crisply , " one ca n't hope for that at my age . " " The young man has been charmed . " " Do n't talk nonsense , Eugenie , " Solange was in no mood to respond to this sort of thing . But Eugenie shook her wise old head and smiled a secret p 123street and out onto a Boulevard which he did n't recognize . He bought the Figaro and sat down in the nearest cafe to eat a ham sandwich and drink a glass of beer . He found himself examining every face that went by as if he could penetrate to the roots of an existence in a few seconds . How alive they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so entirely different one from another ! A boy and a girl , deep in conversation , went by arm in arm . The boy had on an orange shirt open at the throat and thick fair hair that hung down over his forehead , small blue eyes and a rather silly moustache . The girl was bare-legged in sandals , her hair cut short , and Francis was struck by the happiness in her face . She looked at him absent-mindedly , but meeting her eyes gave him a slight shock . And when she smiled , not at him , he gathered this smile like a present . Was it hunger that made everything so vivid ? He sat on for more than half an hour , smoking , reading the paper or pretending to read it , but chiefly filled with an immense unreasoning happiness which made him long to give someone a present . He wanted to talk and laugh and to be forced somehow to define the ideas which bubbled up inside him at every instant . On an impulse he crossed the boulevard finally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all sorts of things to write down almost at once . Armed with a map and his notebook , he felt like an explorer . The first thing he saw as he sauntered along in the sun , was a barrow pushed by four men with something very white , dazzlinglywhite upon it ; as they came nearer the white object proved to be a huge plaster statue of a woman naked to the waist , sitting cross-legged with a baby in her arms  --  no doubt on the way to a foundry to be cast . The plaster was so fresh it looked as if it had 124never been touched by a human hand and the whole figure like a secret truth shouted in the streets . The men in their dirty pants held together by string seemed like dwarfs or creatures in purgatorybound to drag Beauty along forever for all to see . Francis stood still and watched them go past , entranced . In America , he thought , the large white object would have turned out to be a Frigidaire . He laughed with pleasure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridges , he stopped again to take in the full expanse of sky , to see what was being played today in that theatre of clouds . But today the sky was perfectly , uninterruptedly , blue . There on his left was the absurd arrogant gesture of the Eiffel Tower , the grown-up Meccano toy . This too was Paris , this and Beauty carried naked through the streets , this and the dank smell of the river , and Mademoiselle Violette , the incongruously named old maid who ran his pension with the fiercest economy and considered toilet paper a superfluous luxury . The leaves of the trees along the Seine were perfectly still , folded one upon another like painted leaves , except that Francis felt they were breathing quietly . In their very stillness they were alive , intensely alive against the formal stone balustrade of the Tuileries . Then , wishing to be as close to the still olive-green water as possible , he walked down the stone steps to the Quais themselves . Far above him Paris went about its business , the taxis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces and museums , the golden dome of Les Invalides , the fountains of the Concorde stating and restating their silent music . He was very much aware of all this , but at the same time he was now in another world . He saw the remains of a little campfire , and here and there a stone arch boarded up , a pile of sand and bricks as if long ago some work had been begun and forgotten . He passed ap 125knot of ragged-looking men who watched him with hostility , forcing him to walk faster and disappear in the shadow of a bridge . Now he was approaching the Ile de la cite . But still he kept his eyes on the life around him . There , lying quite unselfconsciouslyside by side on a burlap sack , a couple were reading , as absorbed in literature as any bourgeois couple under a red eiderdown in some run-down hotel on the upper level . Further on two women laughed uproariously as they tugged a great sack of rubbish to hide somewhere . These destitute people evidently had here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the upper world of taxis and fountains and cafes and hotel rooms . They did not envy him , they disliked him . Thinking about all this , wishing he could penetrate into this river world , sleep on the stones , bake potatoes in the warm ashes of a fire , and above all share their enormous jokes , Francis did not realize that he was just under Notre Dame . He looked up and met it full in the face , standing high over him at the top of a very steep stone wall entirely covered by green vines . More than ever from here it looked like an immense ship come to port , anchored in the heart of the city , looked tremendously high and great as he did not remember ever thinking when he stood on the upper levels . It was majesty itself . And this , he knew suddenly , is the third level of Paris , the level that soars above the buses and people , the eternal level which makes an immensely worldly city also a holy city . Francis sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took the time to look at it all quietly and at length , till from the whole first impression he began to be aware of the many details , above all of the delicate spire which really soared , he thought , as the Eiffel Tower , so much higher in fact , never could. p 126When he got up to go , he laid his almost full package of cigarettes down as an offering to the gods of the place . The warm light was beginning to flow away from the stone like a falling tide , and Francis thought he had better remember just how to get to the Rond-Point where he was to meet Fontanes for dinner . But first he walked slowly round the great ship , moored in stone , supported by the taut bows of the buttresses so that , he saw now , the spire was made possible by the coming togetherof many strains in balance , springing like an arrow . And there at its base as he came nearer , the three angels his father had pointed out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking quite sedately down the steep angle of the roof , one with a trumpet in his hand . It seemed extraordinary that they should still be there , should have been there all this time , suspended in light and air . If Francis was an explorer , he stood now on a certain height , this height of memory and experience which made it possible for him to look back as well as forward . He was , after all , free now of some things . How bored he had been by those paternal walks on Sundays , listening , half-listening to all his father 's wisdom ! Now he knew that he would never be bored again in just that way . His eyes were open . It had taken a great many years to open them , but as he looked up a last time at Notre Dame he knew that he could look and look and never come to the end of seeing. p 127FONTANES was standing outside the restaurant with a bulging brief case under his arm , his huge black hat at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street , running the half block that separated them . " Well , that 's good , " he said , taking Francis ' arm , " you are five minutes early . " " But you looked as if you had been waiting  --  I 'm sorry . " " I am always ten minutes early . That 's the theatre . It teaches one a rigid sense of time . But as long as you are a five-minutes - early person we shall get on very well . It 's the ten-minute-late people who ruin my meals and give me indigestion . " When they were settled on a bench inside , while Fontanes took out his glasses to read the menu , Francis had a chance to look at him . Now that he was frowning , for this business of the menu was obviously a serious matter , he looked quite formidable . Everything in the face was cut in large shapes , the huge nose , the mobile mouth which looked like an ogre 's mouth when he laughed , the jutting eyebrows and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so massive that one could not tell that he was bald . He gave the impression of a giant though he was not really very tall , but he dominated by the sheer power of his head . Readingthe menu , murmuring certain magic words tentatively " la raie au beurre noire , " " le filet mignon champignons , " " cote de mouton vert pre " he looked like a prophet , Francis thought , or , more curiously , like a clown of genius . The waiter now suffered an inquisition about each item and after some five minutes of discussion Fontanes gave the order , and added with a flourish , " a carafe of my wine , Charles . You know , " he confided to Francis , turning toward him with a broad smile , " I have a vineyard near Bordeaux . That 's why I brought you here to this only passable restaurant , so we could drink my own wine . You see , they have it here . And it 's not a bad wine , not bad at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break as if he were still praising his wine , Fontanes put an arm round Francis ' shoulders and said , " Dear heart , what it is to have you here ! Can you defend yourself ? " he said severely , " for we 'll devour you if not . You will have to be savage . " Francis smiled , " I 'm rather good at that . " " Like your father . " Fontanes looked at him half-humourously and laughed . " No , I think you on the contrary would rather like to be devoured . Only then you must be careful whom you allow to devour you . It 's a serious matter . I , for instance , am perfectly safe . I 'll devour your time and your energy , but I 'll leave that little soul you guard so jealously perfectly free . " It was Francis ' turn to laugh . " And what if I do n't have any little soul ? " " A monster , eh ? " Fontanes teased , pouring out the wine and p 129tasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said hopefully . " And now , to Francis Adams Chabrier ! " He lifted his glass and drank , then set it down hard . " But what in the devil is that Adams ' doing there in the middle of your name . It 's disconcerting . " " Very , " Francis agreed , laughing again . " You are not going to have an easy time getting the pieces of your name into harmony . But it will be interesting . I shall be very interested in the result . " " So shall I . . . " and Francis added lightly , " but for the present I think I shall be just Francis Chabrier , if you do n't mind . " " You are glad to be here , really glad , deep down inside you ? Yes , " said Fontanes , his eyes reading Francis ' face with a curious bold glance , " I think you are . Tell me what you 've been doing all day . Tell me everything in great detail . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time ? " Fontanes lifted his eyebrows . For someonetwenty-six who pretended to be educated not to have read Bergson was amazing . " Oh , of course I had some vague idea what it was all about , " Francis said , blushing . " I suppose you read Sartre instead , eh ? It would be hard for you to imagine the effect Bergson had on the Paris of my youth and your father 's . It turned our world upside-down , inside-out , it came to us like a religious revelation , almost . It became a key like all the real keys which once discovered one can not imagine ever having done without . Poetry , the novel , even music were not the same afterwards . We ourselves were not the same . " " You knew Bergson , I suppose ? " By sight . I met him once or twice , yes  --  so , you are readingp 130Bergson , " Fontanes said , half tenderly , half mockingly . " Not a bad idea for your first day back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hors d'oeuvres and told Charles to take them away and bring them pate maison instead . " Have another glass of wine , " he said apologetically . " You see , the trouble is that the Patron 's wife is ill . No one comes here any more for she was the cook . And it 's sad , sad for the old man . I 'm afraid he is having a hard time . So that 's why I come here . How is the Patron , Charles ? " he asked when the pate was laid before them . The waiter shook his head and pursed his lips , " Ah , Monsieur  --  youknow  --  things are not too good . The Patron had a great shock when Madame was taken to the hospital . He is not the same . " " Neither is the pate , " Fontanes said brusquely as if perhaps he was afraid of being too moved . " No , Monsieur , I regret  --  " " All right , Charles . " And Charles withdrew . " Now , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me where you had lunch , what you had and what you have been doing since . " Fontanes was distressed by the ham sandwich and the glass of beer . " Well , you are an Adams Chabrier after all , " he roared . " A ham sandwich for lunch . How do you expect to live on that ? Is it money ? " he asked , taking out his wallet in real concern . Francis was touched . " No , no , I have plenty of money . Only it was three o'clock and I was too excited really to be hungry or bother with a restaurant . " " Well , all right , only never do it again , " Fontanes said severely. p 131And so Francis found himself describing his walk in great detail , almost eloquently . Fontanes listened in silence and then pushed the pate away half-finished and began to make designs with his knife on the tablecloth . Francis wondered if he had been listening . Or had been bored , but after all , he had asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that a cigarette between courses would seem to Fontanes even worse than a ham sandwich for lunch . Already he was a little flushed by the wine , warm and slightly hallucinated so that now he would have liked to talk about Solange only he did n't dare . " You are a different person from yesterday afternoon , " Fontanesannounced suddenly , " and nothing you have told me explainswhy . " " Have I turned green or something ? " He could see now that Fontanes was a dangerous friend , because he saw too much , too quickly , and perhaps this was what he meant about devouring people . It was lucky that the soup arrived just then and Fontanes ' face cleared . " Now , you do n't get soup like that in Boston , I 'll wager . " " Well , you know , Mother learned to cook in France . " " Oh yes , of course , your mother , " Fontanes had to admit , visibly disappointed . " Still , it 's excellent soup . " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis watched him with fascination . He was rather like an elephant really , only much more impatient than elephants are credited with being . But if one were inside an elephant as Bergson would point out , what looks like patience from a human outsider measuring it against human patiencep 132might be the wildest impulse taking several years to achieve momentum . Francis smiled to himself . " Now you look like your father  --  that was just his secret smile , when he would wander off somewhere alone in the middle of a conversation . " " I was thinking , " Francis said , aware of the incongruity and enjoying it to the full , " about the impulses of elephants and their conception of time . " Fontanes threw back his head and laughed the rich loud laugh Francis would come to associate always with him , a laugh which included the universe , it seemed , so gigantic it was . " But that is just like your father ! It 's exactly the sort of thing he was always saying  --  elephants  --  why elephants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soup from his chin . " I do n't know ... " " Well , now , what has happened to you since yesterday ? " Francis dived into his steak hungrily and wondered what on earth to answer . Was he so different ? " I do n't know , " he said after a moment , " I seem to have developed a vast appetite for almost everything . I think it 's Paris . I feel liberated . " He was being entirely honest , because he had no idea himself what was happening to him , what had in a sense already happened to him . " And how long do you plan to stay , Francis ? A year ? Two years ? " " I do n't know . I know nothing . I 'm just what Gide calls available . ' I 'll have to see what happens . But you know , I shall have to decide what I 'm to do , what I 'm to be , sometime , " he ended . " So I expect I shall go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who quoted Gide , had never read Bergson , did n't know what he wanted outp 133of life and at the same time seemed extremely definite , almost theatrically definite about everything . There is something , Fontanesdecided , that I do n't know . I do not have the key . " You do n't think I should go back ? " Francis asked after a short silence . " I must say , it fills me with dread . " " I can understand that . But you know , Francis , what I think  --  whatever you do , it must be something where your total self is engaged , can come into play . There 's no point in choosing to be one thing or another , choosing mechanically  --  you are French and American , Adams and Chabrier , after all . There is no escapingthat and so what you must do is discover a way of being both at the same time , of using all that . It 's all very well to talk about being available , but it 's dangerous  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eye Francis severely , " you may fall into the heresy of Gide . " Francis was puzzled . " You mean , heresy against the church . " " No , no of course not , " Fontanes growled , " heresy against life itself . Availability is all very well , the prerogative of poets and lovers , but it 's pretty cheap without responsibility , eh ? To whom , to what in the long run are you responsible ? That is the question , it seems to me . " Francis smiled . " I 'm irresponsible , that 's evident , " he said without resentment . " While you are here , " said Fontanes almost crossly , " you had better learn something about yourself , as well as about Paris . " " I fully intend to . " Francis was a little irritated by Fontanes now , probing to the heart of matters he preferred to conceal , even perhaps from himself . He had not , he thought , run away from Boston , from Aunt Alison and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " responsibility . " p 134For the first time since he had arrived in Paris he felt the cloud of his own confusion and doubt settling down on him , that atmosphere of disguised conflict in which he had lived for so long . " Well , well , " Fontanes put an arm round him gently , " I 'm a violent old man , but I must tell you that , unlike a great many people today , I believe in America . I think you are the only hope for civilization . That 's all , " he ended as if they had talked seriously long enough , " and now we must have some coffee . Is the coffee drinkable , Charles ? " He talked then about his new play , about which he was very excited , as he had discovered the author , a young Belgian , and had high hopes of him . He described the devil of a time he had had raising the money for the production . He had sold a painting of Vuillard 's to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said with a slightly guilty expression like a woman who has sold a jewel , " it is worth it . " All during the dinner Francis had held down the longing to speak of Solange , to hear Fontanes talk about Solange . Now while Fontanes waited for his bill , in the silence of the cigarettes the compulsion became too strong to resist . " I am going to see Claudel 's play with Madame Bernard , " he said suddenly . And he was aware that calling her Madame Bernardto Fontanes was in itself a slight deception . In the second after he had spoken it dawned on him that he was involved more than he admitted to himself . Was all this new aliveness and excitement that he felt , the beauty of the trees , the sense of Paris itself , his sudden longing to be human , human enough to share in the life of those tramps under the bridges , all this nothing but what is known in New England as " a personal emotion " ? Recog-p 135nition flashed through him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is very good for Solange that you are here this summer , " Fontanes said seriously . " You see , for her your mother 's death just when she had been looking forward so happily to seeing her , was a final blow after too many others . You will bring her somethingof the future , you know , something to look forward to . I have been worried about her . " " She seems so alive , so gay  --  I do n't know  --  " Francis stumbled on the words  --  " radiant . " " Yes , yes , " Fontanes interrupted impatiently , " that is the way she seems , but all that light has its deep shadows , you know . And sometimes the shadows come too close . We are all ill , here in France , since the war  --  the last war bled France nearly to death . But this was worse , this war poisoned the very sources . " SuddenlyFontanes ' own face looked old . Francis noticed the deep wrinkles , the sagging throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . And he was silent , because he was ashamed to speak , he who had suffered nothing , knew almost nothing , had spent the war chiefly bored almost to tears , imprisoned in a uniformand a routine without meaning since he had never got into the fight . " And for those of us who believed , who in our own way , resisted  --  you know , of course that Solange worked for a secret press  --  but Francis had not known this descent into party politicsof the most violent kind has been even worse . You come here and feel the beauty of Paris , " Fontanes went on wagging his finger accusingly at Francis , " but for us Paris stinks . Go and walk through the Rue St. Honore . Look at the faces . Look at the people in the big American cars . It will make you vomit . " p 136 " New York is just as bad , worse maybe , " Francis said appalledat the flood of bitterness . " But New York was never Paris . New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monuments . Here only the dead are pure . " And Fontanes whose changes of mood could be violent seemed now to have forgotten to whom he was talking , seemed in a hurry to go , nursing his rage . " Tell the Patron to come back , " Fontanes said to Charles . " Tell him things are not the same here and he is needed , " he admonished Charles . " And you , Francis , " he said at the door as if he were Napoleon giving orders to a general , " go and see Solange . Cheer her up . If you must have a responsibility , there 's one for you . " Francis watched him hail a taxi and get into it , and stood for several minutes on the pavement , thinking of all he had heard . It 's not possible that Solange needs me , he thought . There was a whole night and half a day ahead before he would see her . Alreadybehind the real figure an intangible figure , the figure of his imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who is perhaps not there at all , the person the lover creates out of his own need and to his own dimension. p 137FOR THE NEXT WEEK or so Francis lived this new vivid life of wandering about Paris , reading philosophy and exploring Solange whom he saw nearly every day . They went to the Orangerie to see a special show of mediaeval German art ; they went to the theatre and got into a long argument about the Claudel play which Francis hated ( it was an atmosphere to which he had no key , this atmosphere of passion ) . So Solange gave him the Soulier de Satin as an antidote and teased him about sacred and profane love . They sat in the Cafe des Deux Magots , drinking chocolate , making malicious comments about the Americansall around them , and watching the light slowly change on the face of the old church ; they sat in the Luxembourg Gardens under the cool green umbrella of a chestnut ; every day had its special flavor and every day was a holiday . Perhaps , Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontanes is right and I am being useful in distracting her , so he even felt justified for all this joy , that it was not stolen but given , and that he was giving instead of taking , himself . Meanwhile his notebook becamefull of her comments which he studied as if he were study-p 138ing a map . He had to discover her on his own for she told him very little and avoided anything personal . But once she had said , " Only really passionate people know anything about detachment " ( they were talking of his mother ) " because they are forced to learn it or to die ; no one comes willingly to detachment . " They were sitting in the Tuilleries Gardens in the small patch of shade afforded by a huge stone urn on a pedestal . It was a hot day and Francis remembered the expanse of dazzling sand and the pool where the children sailed their boats . He rememberedtwo young men half lying in chairs , their shirts open at the neck looking drunk with sunlight . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this talk , felt a hunger for darkness and silence , for something he could n't define , obliteration . Solange sat beside him in a pink dress , in a large black hat . She looked very charming . But she had gone on talking , inexorably , while a part of him refused to listen . He thought he would never forget the light , the air , the pink tobacco plants which seemed rather incongruous and floppy in the formal parterre behind them , and yet he could n't remember just what she had said . It was strange . For he imagined afterwards that what she said must have been a key and now he would never find it . What he would remember forever and ever was a pink dress , a black hat , a woman whom , in a flashing instant of wild anger , he would have liked to strangle into silence . He had never touched her since she took his hand so absentmindedlythat first day . And in fact he went out of his way not to take her arm when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when they were together he was acutely conscious of every part of himself , his feet , his hands , his neck ; this made him clumsy . When he shaved in the morning hep 139looked at himself with immense distaste . His mouth seemed small and pinched and his nose too big . It was as if he had no face as yet and looked out of himself as animals look out of their faces like spirits caught and wishing to get out . He was beginning to find it difficult to concentrate ; he no longer felt like reading . There was a heat wave which did n't help . And once Solange said sharply , " You are n't listening , Francis ! " It was true that his attention wandered from her words to her throat , to her amazing subtle mouth , to her clear eyes which he had thought were blue , but he knew now to be gray , piercingly clear , devastating in their clarity . Solange herself refused to admit what was happening . She pushed aside the mounting tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . " I 'm taking you to Madame Clermont 's , " she said . " It might amuse you to see that Paris  --  you know , the Avenue Foch , all rather grand . Would it amuse you ? " she had asked almost tenderly , lowering her eyes before his insistent gaze . " I think it 's time we saw someone besides ourselves  --  otherwiseyou will cease to listen to what I say , become bored  --  and , " she added with malice , " I shall become bored too . " Then she left him to go to work , left him in the Luxembourg Gardens where they had taken refuge in the shade , left him to think how dusty and dry the leaves looked , how parched the flowers , now that she was gone . The next day he waited for her in the salon , on a wave of rising excitement . Partly he was excited and a little nervous at being launched into society . But he waited for her to come in as if he were a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress . What would she wear ? How would she look ? p 140Was the red and white camellia he had brought and asked Eugenie to take in to her , suitable ? Francis wandered restlessly about this room which had become so familiar , as he always did , a little as if he were trying to find here some lost object which he half remembered . Often , as he did now , he went over to the desk and looked at the row of photographs , his mother 's serene face looking out seriously from the silver frame , Fontanes in profile looking like someone dead a long time ago and nothing like himself , and the bland secretive face of Andre , her husband , to whom he had taken an intense dislike , and who looked on the contrary , very much alive , smiling an ironic smile which Francis took irrationallyas a personal comment . When Solange spoke of her husband as she often did , prefacing a sentence by " Andre used to say , " or " When Andre and I were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hear . " You are not interested in Andre at all , " she had said rather crossly only the other day . " No , " Francis said shortly . And she had lifted her eyebrows and changed the subject . Solange had tactfully changed her dress so that she would be able to wear the flower , and that was what made her late , so when she came in she was in a hurry and said , almost brusquely , " Tell me , does it look all right ? " " Perfect , " he said laconically after one swift glance at her . " Come along then , I want to get there early so that I can introduce you properly to Louise Clermont  --  you ' know , she adored your father . She is very anxious to meet you . " " She 'll be disappointed , I expect . " Francis felt cross . He was upset because in the one glance he had given Solange , unaccountablybrilliant and distant in her black suit , in her absurd fashion-p 141able hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the society they were about to enter , standing between them . She herself , for once , seemed not quite at her ease . She talked very fast when they had captured a taxi and were safely on their way and talked about things which irritated him , for instance the fact that althoughshe had had this suit entirely remade it still was not right , about an argument she had had that morning with an editor , and all the time he was half listening , he looked at her gloved hands and would have liked to pull off the gloves . Her face for the moment was just a worldly face , but hands never conceal anything . There she was , enveloped like a mummy , he thought bitterly , in all the multiple bandages of the world while he himselfmight as well have been stark naked so ill-armed did he feel . The taxi swung round the Arc de Triomphe and Francis looked out , taken by surprise as he always would be by the height of the arch , by the sheer grandeur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the echo of trumpets and drums , the inexplicable sadness of parades , all that the French mean when they use their word , " La Gloire , " with its tragic overtones of the eleventh hour at the Marne , of De Gaulle 's first broadcast , or of the small plaques which Francis had noticed all over Paris , sometimes with a faded bunch of violets or roses beside them , noting that here a Resistant fell during the liberation . They turned down into the splendor of trees , the broad sandy paths of the Avenue Foch and stopped , much too soon he thought , for he had been enjoying himself . Solange paid for the taxi because he had been absent-minded as usual . She gave his arm a friendly squeeze , " Here we are , Francis . Are you nervous ? You have n't listened to a word I 've said for the last few minutes . " " I 'm sorry . But you know , I have to get used to Paris . Itp 142takes me by surprise  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a moment they stood under the trees and looked down the long perspective to the soft blur of St. Cloud . Then it was really time to go in . The elevator crept slowly up five stories . There was just room for two ; to be suddenly and for purely mechanical reasons standing so close to Solange , without being able to move , suspended in the air , helpless , made her nearness seem intolerable . Francis was immensely relieved to come in out of the dark into the large sunny drawing room , to be swept into the embrace of Louise Clermont , an old woman in her eighties who led him triumphantly around the room to introduce him to an Ambassador , a Countess and several other ladies . With the last of these , who looked like a brilliant-eyed almost human monkey , and wore a great many jewels , he found himself cornered by a tray of champagne glasses . Solange was at the other end of the room now , talking to the Ambassador . She did not catch his eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked on a small strawberry tart and , without having said a word to the woman at his side , suddenly disappeared onto the balcony through the French windows . For the moment he was safe . He took a deep breath and saw where he was , the magic of this balcony floating in the air high over the soft green mounds of the chestnut trees . To the right he could catch just a glimpse of the Arc de Triomphe and to the left the long velvety sweep down to the Bois and further off the unattainable paradise which St. Cloud seems to be from here . " So you 've run away , " the cracked old voice teased . " But you ca n't run away . You have got to come back with me and be polite . Do you know , " she said , delighted with him it seemed , " that isp 143exactly what your father did the first time he came here , more than twenty years ago . I had to bring him back and plant him in front of Valery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very kind and I am very rude , " Francis said humbly , because he liked this old woman immensely . " But I forgive you , because it 's lovely , my balcony , is n't it ? It 's my treasure , this view . It keeps me alive and it makes me wise , too , that is what is amazing . " " I think Paris makes everyone wise , " Francis said , and he laughed suddenly with happiness . " Even I feel wise here . " " No , you are too young , " she said as if she were unwilling to give him all the presents at once , " I am eighty-three and so I have a right to be wise . But you perhaps only have the right to be foolish  --  or mad . How mad are you ? " she asked pointedly . " Completely , " Francis said seriously . " Oh , that 's very good . That 's all right . Then you had better come back in . You might fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balcony , drying her hair , " she said maliciously . And Francis did not have time to point out that it was broad daylightso he could hardly fall in love with the moon . But he was glad to follow her , to find his hand clasped rather roughly in her ringed fingers and to be brought back . " He is quite mad , so he assures me , " she announced to the room at large , " but I think quite safe  --  and very charming . Now , first , you must talk to this man . His name which you will forget no doubt is Descharnes , but you will not forget him . Monsieur Descharnes adores the memory of your father . There , I 'll leave you two together , " she said with a satisfied gleam in her eyes , and made her way to the other end of the room to greet a group of newly arrived guests. p 144 " You are in Paris for some time ? " M. Descharnes asked politely . Francis noticed his very thin face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bones , his pale blue eyes , his rather large ears which gave him a look of perpetual surprise . He was dressed impeccably , no doubt by an English tailor , and looked as if he washed his hands every half hour . All these things Francis noticed while he explained that he did n't know how long he would stay , that for the moment he was simply taking a vacationafter his exams and that later on he would decide about the winter . " So  --  you are marvelously , fantastically free , " M. Descharnes answered . " And you are young . And you are American . Is n't this to be as near to a god as a human being can hope to come ? I envy you , Monsieur . " It was hard to tell whether in the pale blue eyes there was a shadow of a smile . " The question is , how long will you be able to keep this divine freedom , how long will you be able to stand out against it all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Solange . She must have gone into the other room , for he did n't see her . He began , while they talked of freedom so glibly , to feel a wild impatience , to wish to go in search of her at once . But he controlled himself and lit a cigarette . " All what ? " M. Descharnes asked , obviously enjoying himself , " well , to begin with , all this  --  this delightful prison of social relations , social obligations . " " I doubt if I ever get into that prison , " Francis said ironically . " Ah , that 's what we all begin by saying , and then we find ourselves coming back to certain rooms , at certain times , because , for instance we know we shall find a certain person there , and this process extends itself gradually to two or three people , and p 145becomes a net , at first a very delicate net , but one morning we wake up and find we are no longer free . The little blue book is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Frances said , amused , for none of this had the slightest relation to any reality he knew or would ever know . " Or else  --  " M. Descharnes smilingly continued , " on the contrary , the little blue book contains only one name , and then you may be sure we are less free than ever before . " Solange appeared in the doorway between the two rooms and Francis , lighting up suddenly , made her a sign to join them , but she turned the other way , toward the monkey he had abandoned and greeted her effusively . Had this been deliberate ? M. Descharnes was speaking less lightly now . " Eventually every choice we make diminishes our freedom until , perhaps in spite of ourselves , we find that the future is already designed , and the very freedom we imagined we had , cast a long and definite shadow which was some sort of inescapable responsibility . That , as you recognize , was one of your father 's ideas , " he said looking intently at Francis now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices are still to be made  --  be careful , " he said , halfmockingly , " it 's dangerous to be a god . Gods too cast long shadows . " But why did she turn away ? Francis was asking himself while he half listened and now he did n't dare even look at her , under the clear gaze of these blue eyes , of this curiously charming but very perspicacious man . " Did my father cast a long shadow ? " he asked , refusing to answer for himself . And in fact what was troubling was that he sensed that they all talked to him in a way as if they were talkingp 146to his father , to someone they knew very well . But he did not have that advantage . He not only had not known their fathers , he had not known his own  --  or himself . In fact he knew nothing . An idiot would have been closer to the truth than a god . " Very long , " M. Descharnes said seriously , " I have been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't come to the end of them yet . " Francis was drinking another glass of champagne . While he listened , for these things were important and . he was really listeningnow , he wondered how many of the people in this room remembered his father . " You see , " he said after a moment , " I was too young when he died , to know anything about him . " " I 'll tell you a curious thing about Pierre Chabrier , " M. Descharnes went on , " he was only happy in action . He hated to think . All the last years I felt he was like a tiger in a cage pacing back and forth in his mind , trying to find the way out . That is why this idea of freedom haunted him  --  " But just then , and as Francis , deeply stirred , would have probed farther , Madame Clermont pounced again . " Do n't take him away , " M. Descharnes said , " I have just begun to get his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged off to the corner where Solange , Madame Beauregard ( that was the monkey 's name ) , and a Monsieur Tangere were talking apparently about Sartre . Solange refused to catch his eye and since this was suddenly all that Francis wanted in the world , he paid no attention to what was going on . He fell into a complete silence . " Does he ever speak ? " Madame Beauregard turned to Solange , with an air of amusement . " Just now when we were p 147introduced , he stood beside me for five minutes and did not say one word . Then he fled . " Francis hated her with a savage hatred . " Perhaps if you ask him a direct question . . . " Solange smiled , cruelly , Francis thought . " But then it will have to be such an important question , after such an important silence , " the monkey said , her jewels glittering and her eyes glittering all at once , as if she had discovered a new and amusing game . They treat me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " You see , I am an idiot , Madame , " he said very quietly . " An idiot , " she giggled suddenly , " but he has wit ! He 's charming . " Francis looked desperately at Solange . " I 'm afraid we must be going , Madame , " he said addressing her in an icy voice . For a second she hesitated , and he thought she would say , " Not at all , it 's early . " But she turned to the monkey quite coolly and said , " He 's right . Alas , we are due somewhere else . You will have to ask him that all-important question some other time . " He was saved . She had saved him . Francis blushed to the roots of his hair with gratitude . They stood by the elevator , having made their polite farewellsto Madame Clermont . They stood , silent , listening to the slow glide of the ropes and waited and waited as the elevator crept up the five stories toward them . They got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very carefully Solange put on her gloves . Only when they were standing in the street , at the very place where they had stopped happily on their way in , did shep 148say gently , " Why do you have to be so rude , Francis ? You really are difficult . " And now the tide of emotion , of tension that had been rising in him through all these days suddenly pulled him forward , far beyond where he intended to be , forced him to say , " Because I get so angry with you , with myself  --  because  --  I love you , do n't you see ? And I ca n't stand it any longer . " It was the wrong thing to say , the wrong moment to say it . Francis now felt emptied of everything , hopeless , lost . " Do n't talk nonsense , " she said sharply , angrily . " You , you . . . " His hand clasped her gloved one , so hard his own hurt . " Solange  --  " He forced her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , only amazed , now , frightened to look for a second at his , whose whole being had become a consuming question . " But you 're mad , Francis . " And then as he dropped her hand and ran off into the street , " where are you going ? " " Taking you home , " he called back . She watched him run across the street to catch a taxi going in the wrong direction . Should she refuse to go with him , in this wild mood ? But suddenly she was trembling so much that she was glad to get into the taxi and sit down , as far in her corner as possible , entirely withdrawn . This time neither of them looked out and after what seemed a very long time , she said in her usual voice , " I am going to forget what you just said , Francis . And you must forget it . You must , " she underlined the last word almost harshly . " Now you 're talking nonsense . One does n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded . Suddenly he felt full of power , a god , M. Descharnes said , and Francis , who for the first time in his life knew exactly what he wanted , felt like ap 149god . His anger , his uncertainty , his tension , his nervousness had all fallen away . He was there , in his whole self and he knew that she could n't deny him . " Certainly not , " she said coldly . " Why should I take them off ? " " As you please , " Francis smiled in his corner of the taxi . At this moment of extreme danger , he did n't even know he was in danger . He felt , for the first time in his life , perfectly safe . But Solange knew and she was afraid . She was afraid of herselfbecause she was troubled and had to admit that she was . Francis in the last two weeks had displaced a great deal of atmosphere , had managed to invade her days and even her nights , in a way she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt happier than she had for years , watching his closed face open little by little , watching him blaze up and grow , change before her eyes . She had been devoutly grateful for all he had brought her of youth , that fierce intensity , even the rudeness which she had grown to love as it was part of him , the suddenness , the honesty , the torment . She had felt a tenderness well up insideher which she imagined to be not personal but a tenderness for life itself and everything that must grow and change in order to live . More , she had imagined that she was useful . Now , in one second he had smashed these illusions . Now , she thought bitterly , I shall only hurt him and wither all the young green shoots  --  even if . . . but here she spoke again in order not to think . " You told me once that you had never been in love , Francis . Was that true ? " " Of course it was true , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly now , without the slightest hesitation as if it already belonged to him , always had belonged to him . Yes , indeed he had grown up . In the last few momentsp 150he had become a man , and as a man a formidable antagonist . Solange felt a sharp pain just under her heart . No , she thought , desperately  --  no -- Only he was in an entirely different sphere now . He turned a shining face toward her and said gently , " Look at the trees , Solange , they are all on fire . " " My dear , " she smiled , in spite of herself , " you may be on fire  --  I must believe you since you say so  --  but I can assure you that nothing else is , not the trees "  --  and now she forced herself to add  --  " not me . " She was relieved to see that they were nearly home . Once they were out of the taxi , the spell would be broken . She would escape . She would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face like hands and she shrank from them , for it was not a caress , this look , it was an attack and she answered it in the only way she could , by turning her head and looking him straight in the eye , but withholdingeverything from this look so that it was a perfect blank . " There , little Francis , " she said , smiling , " you see , you have made a mistake . I 'm sorry . " The taxi swerved into the Rue de l'Universite and for a second she lost her balance and leaned against him , and was annoyed with herself for withdrawing as violently as if she felt a physical repulsion . " And now you must leave me here . Shall I see you tomorrow ? " " I expect so , " Francis said . " Come to lunch , then . We might go and see some pictures . " " We might . " While Francis ' back was turned as he paid the taxi , she fled . It was an ignominious flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empty when she went in . She sat down with her hat still on as if she were in someone else 's house and looked around , but if she had hoped to find some friendly ghosts here she had been wrong . All she found was a desolation of emptiness , and the half-smoked cigarettebutt Francis had left in the ashtray . There was now an enmity , she felt , between her living body and all the things in this room . She was no longer at home here , nor safe , even here . For this room was filled with the past and she had in the last half hour been forced to take an immense leap into the present , a present she had imagined no longer existed for her , would never exist again . She was deeply shaken . It was not a question , she saw now of right nor wrong , but of what merely was possibleor not possible . From now on she would be the hunted fox , keeping a few steps ahead of the hounds , perhaps but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage she got up and went into the kitchen , " I 'm going out , Eugenie . Never mind about supper , " she said coldly as if poor Eugenie were in some way at fault . And that , she thought , bitterly , is what this madnessp 152does  --  drives me out into the street to eat in a strange cafe and hurt Eugenie 's feelings . It was ridiculous , stupid . And , she thought , I 'll have none of it . I 'll go away . Yes  --  the immense vista of freedom opened before her , the sudden realization that no one could force her to stay here . But at the first corner , she saw Francis drinking a pernod and , as if nothing had happened , reading the paper . His smile , as she drew nearer , ran to meet her without a shadow of doubt or fear and touched her like an embrace . She sank down beside him , without a word , and ordered a coffee . " You 're cold , " he said , surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you go out without a coat at this hour ? " he said severely as if she were a child . " You 've upset me , Francis ! " It was a bleak admission . But he accepted it as if it had been the one saving word he had waited for all his life . " Darling , " he said , " do n't be upset . Do n't worry and be anxious . Be happy , for my sake if not for your own . Ca n't you imagine what this is to me ? This being alive suddenly after all these years ? Of being free after all the years in prison ? Do n't feel you have to give me anything , if you ca n't  --  " ( Oh these lovers ' gifts which are always taken back , she thought , for from now on his very presence would be a demand and he would not be able to help it . ) " I feel marvelous , " he said so loudly that the couple at the next table turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next table are listening . " " What do I care ? I 'd just as soon climb the obelisk in the Concorde with a megaphone and shout , Listen ! I 'm in love ! I 'm in love ! Poor people , you have no idea what it is like . But I know . " He was laughing now himself. p 153 " Do n't , Francis , do n't  --  " she begged . " I ca n't bear it . " He watched her sip her coffee ; in the midst of the unresolvedtension between them , he felt only an immense peace . He was quite content to sit here beside her forever and to watch her sip coffee . " Let me keep this happiness a little while . It 's so new , " he said gently . She would go on protesting , but from the moment she saw him so unexpectedly in the cafe , she had known that there was no longer a decision to be made . Life had made it . Still , she must protest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be said first . " I 'm a desert , Francis . I 'm not what you think  --  " " Well , let me walk beside you in your desert , that 's all I ask . " " You 're too young , " she said because it seemed kinder to them both than to say , " I 'm too old . " But that , perhaps was the truth . She observed him now , gone down into himself , as if he had n't heard what she said , entranced . Finally as if there had been no silence , no interval between her remark and his answer , he lifted his head . " Yes , I 'm young , but I know about the desert . I have been there for years . I have always been there until now . That 's what you do n't understand . Oh Solange , do n't try to be detached "  --  and she knew that the sardonic emphasis on the word " detached " came from real suffering , from his mother  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My dear , come with you  --  where ? " She knew that her voice was saying something else than the words and that her voice was saying , " Anywhere , I 'll go with you to the end ofp 154this journey , " but she could n't help her voice , the creature of her body . She was already transported into regions where reasonhas no place , wrapped in the mysteries no one will ever understand . " To all the places you know and which I do n't know where people can love each other in peace . Oh , I need peace so much , " he ended and she knew that it was true and that for a little while at least she could give him peace . " What a beggar I am ! " he said and it was wrenched out of him , bitterly . " Do n't say anything , " he begged . " Just be quiet . " She looked at him , fully and deeply , allowed him to feel his way down into the depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis saw the spirit of the woman shiver there , for a second , and took possession . He was full of awe . So this was love , this opening deep deep down , this gift of something one did not know one had in one 's possession , this obliteration of the self in another self . And all this had happened in a few seconds , sitting in an ordinary cafe on an ordinary evening . The people at the next table did n't even know it had happened . But he would never be the same again. p 155T E NEXT DAY they did after all go to see pictures and what had been a threat when Solange said it and had meant we shall go to see pictures and be sensible , now became something entirelydifferent , became we shall go to see pictures together because every familiar painting in the Louvre must be seen again now , because it has become something entirely different , because we ourselves are not the same people we were yesterday . They walked arm in arm , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk down the long formal galleriesin a dream , stopping here and there and especially beforethe Chardins , the Pieter der Hoochs , and the Vermeer because such ecstasy needs simple objects to rest on , a loaf of bread , a fish on a plate . Every now and then Francis looked at Solange , just to be sure it was true , to receive again the slight shock , the tingle of something like fear as he realized again that he had entered into a universe he had not known existed and which was his to love , cherish , learn by heart . But this was not to be talked about , only felt . They talked instead about what they looked at , drawing each other 's attention to some detail , p 156sometimes laughing suddenly when in their state of mastery of all around them they concluded that a certain painting was absolutely false or ludicrous . Occasionally they disagreed . " Darling , " said Solange after half an hour of this sort of looking , " I shall have to sit down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already for a past , to the same two chairs under the stone urn where they had sat a few days before . " I did n't know when we sat here before , " Francis said happily , lighting a cigarette and passing it to her like a present . " Oh , the things I did n't know , " he laughed . And then , " My love , my love , how did I ever find you ? " The pink tobacco plants behind them waved back and forth hysterically in a sudden gust of wind . Clouds they had n't noticedcovered the sun and Solange shivered . The bubble of happiness she had held so lightly in her hands , burst and she was filled with forebodings . She turned to him , and saw he was still there , smiling his secret smile , his brilliant wilful reality takingall this for granted already . Whom would he marry ? What had she stolen in one night from a young girl  --  some young girl she would never know , perhaps waiting in America ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him and asked herself . " Why is it always slightly suspicious ? Why do we turn it round and round looking for the flaw ? " " But you are happy ? " Francis asked , disturbed by this change of her mood as if she were reflecting the sky . " You have no regrets ? " " No , dear heart . " For a while at least , she thought , let us believe we are angels even if we have to become monsters to ourselves later . So they sat hand in hand until large drops ofp 157rain forced them to run out to the street and climb into a taxi . " Do you know where we 're going ? " Francis asked . " No , do you ? " She was out of breath from running so fast . " We are going to Notre Dame . " So do all true lovers wish to bring their love to the highest and holiest place for a blessing . Solange recognized his impulse and was grateful . It was a strange poignant pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had known for years , known and almost forgotten . She had come here with Jacques twenty years ago , Jacques , the cruel , the devastating , the Jacques of those days when she knew Persis , Jacques of whom she had never breathed a word to Francis . Had her moment of fear in the Tuileries just now been a reminder from the ghost of Jacques ( as if she needed reminding ! ) that passion is a poison and always someone dies of it , someone is cruelly hurt ? But Francis at that moment took her hand and kissed it , each finger and then the palm and she felt the sweetness in him flowing into her like a balm . Why look back or forward ? Why question ? If only I could kneel and really pray , Francis thought when they had pushed open the leather door and stood in the silence . Why ca n't I ? When his mother died his whole existence had seemed in question . Nothing had any reality and yet he had felt no such hunger for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his love , of his passion , in the first newness of himself , already unappeasable hungers were planted . Solange had wandered off down the right aisle and he followed her . Then they sat for a short time before the strangely worldly Virgin , each locked in his thoughts. p 158Francis had felt impelled to come here as if he had a burdenor an offering to lay at the altar , as if perhaps being conscious of the full power and glory of his own body he wished to give thanks . But now that he was here , sitting uncomfortablyon the low chair , it was not after all possible to make his offering , to lay down his burden , simply as he had laid his head on Solange 's shoulder last night . He was unable to kneel , unable to give up a parcel of his own consciousness of himself and of this woman who sat beside him suddenly a stranger as strange as the Virgin holding the Child on her flowing hip . He was a modern man dressed in a gray suit , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole earth as his possession , the mountains and rivers , the soft hills and valleys of her unimaginablebeauty as he had been last night . Now he felt small , diminished , afraid of this silence which seemed to have parted him from Solange , not brought them together solemnly in the presence of God , as he had intended . She looked distant , wrapped in her solitude . So he whispered , " Come , let 's go home , " and very quickly almost as if they were running away from the candles and the incense , they walked out . It was raining hard , one of those sudden harsh rains that fall out of the sky without a warning . There was no taxi in sight on the whole wet square . And where should they go ? At the Rue de 1'Universite Eugenie would be there ( thank Heavens she slept at the end of a long hall and Francis had dressed and gone out before she woke , at six o'clock that morning ) . Could he face Mademoiselle Tonnerre as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Solange to face her inquisitiveblack eyes , her malice ? Where , where could he take his love now ? And she was saying , p 159 " Take me back , Francis . I must do some work . And you must go and find your own little peace until suppertime . That is what 's wise , " she said firmly , sensing by the pressure of his arm what very different ideas he had at the moment . But now she felt exhausted , and she needed to be by herself . " Do n't be wise , not yet , " he pleaded . " It 's so lonely in the rain . Or let me bring my books over to your place and read  --  I 'll promise to be quiet . " They were still standing in the doorway . Time flowed past like the rain . Had they been here a few moments ? An hour ? " All right . " What else could she say ? When he found a taxi and they rattled off on their way first to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'Universite , she sat withdrawnin her corner , leaning her head against the cold leather seat , her eyes closed . Now she was back in the human dwellings again she realized that though her desert had been terrible it had had the advantage at least of freedom . Whole areas were blocked off now . Almost , she felt she was in a prison . Francis sensed the distance and was unaware that he had himself created it by his demand to come and share her peace . He became very tense , watching her for some sign , some explanation . Was she thinking of Andre ? The idea made him sit bolt upright and stare out of the window where he still saw her face frozen as if the image were photographed on his retina . The delicate slightly taut line of her chin and throat haunted him . Perhaps he had fallen in love , had desired her physically the first time she had turned her head away from him and looked out of the window . He remembered she had been sayinghow glad she was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desert . And he had known in that instant that 160she was not to be possessed , that some part of her would always escape him , that there was too much behind her , too many faces he did n't know , too many other  --  " Come along , here we are , " he said harshly , gathering the books together . " You run while I pay this man , or you 'll get wet . " She was talking to Eugenie when he finally rang the bell . " Monsieur will have his tea in the drawing room , Eugenie . Will you bring me mine in the bedroom ? I must do some work . " So , he was banished . Francis was filled with rage , with amazement . What had happened ? What had he done ? Already , Solange thought bitterly , I am withering the green shoots , but I ca n't help it . He will have to learn what is and is not possible . I must be allowed to be myself . But the very fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a wall between them , made it impossible for her to be herself . She lay down on the bed with a pile of pillows behind her , cigarettes , an ashtray , and the pile of manuscripts she must read , and sighed . Everything was the same as usual except , she thought ironically , the pillow is rather crumpled . Eventually , she supposed , Eugenie would have to know . It was a disturbing thought . The telephone rang . Absent-mindedly she picked up the receiver . It was a shock to hear Fontanes ' rather loud rasping voice ( he always shouted on the phone as if he imagined he would n't be heard ) . She felt guilty all of a sudden , as if she had betrayed him . " How 's the play going ? " she asked , knowing that he would try to read her voice , her mood and afraid of just that . " Terribly . I got into an awful rage with that little Le Monnier  --  he 's so conceited . Of course it did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhinoceros  --  and eventually he will bep 161perfect in the part when I have managed to enrage him , " Fontanes laughed . " You sound just like yourself , " she laughed too . " And why not ? And how are you , my little blessing ? Workingtoo hard I expect ? When do I see you ? " " When you like  --  this evening for dinner , for instance . " She was amazed at the relief she felt at the idea of not having dinner with Francis . " I 'll come and get you at seven . Look as beautiful as possible . How is our little Francis ? I 've tried to get him three times on the phone . He is never in . " " He 's here at the moment , reading in the salon . " " And where are you ? " " Working on my bed . " " What strange ideas you have of entertaining people ! " " No , it is they who have strange ideas of entertaining me . " " You are cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other end of the phone . " Am I ? " and with that , and an " au revoir until tonight , " she hung up . She half regretted her decision now . She had just made things difficult for herself and for Francis , more difficult than they needed to be and she saw with perfect clarity that they would be difficult , remembering the tone of Fontanes ' voice that first day when he said , " Boston must be a very serious place . " Francis would throw himself complete , whole , with all his demands , needs , questions , doubts into the next weeks or months . He would , she foresaw , analyze , deepen , extract the subtlest meanings from every moment they would have together . For , she knew already , she divined that he was thatp 162most redoubtable of lovers , the mystic , who would try to make a religion of love . This was his father speaking through him clearly . He did not have an ounce of his mother 's saving grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's so young , she reminded herself . How many times would she have to remind herself of this fact ? For she saw she would have to be detached . She must be wise , since he could not . When the sharp knock came at the door and Francis appeared , smiling rather shyly , with the teatray , she was glad to be faced with a human reality instead of her tormented thoughts . " Ca n't I have tea with you ? " he said . " Eugenie agrees with me that it is very cruel to make me have my tea alone . . . " In a single look at his face she saw that he had been suffering  --  already . " Of course , darling , come in and sit down . " Shyly he glanced around this room in the daylight while happiness flowed through him like a liquor . He poured out the tea , rather awkwardly . He sat on the end of the bed , sipping his with a spoon like a child , looking up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile as well as the tea . How Persis must have adored him , she thought  --  and yet she too had made him suffer , had withered the green shoots . " What are you thinking about ? " he asked gently . Her face , which he studied like a foreign language , kept teaching him new words . This word was tenderness , but he did not recognize it . He thought she looked sad and wondered why . " I was thinking about your mother , how she must have loved you when you came and drank tea on her bed . " He froze and answered stiffly , " I never did . " He sensed the danger , the transposition to another key of what had been lastp 163night great and fierce , the tremendous opening to a place where they were more or less than human . He did not want her tenderness , not yet . He pushed it aside violently . " Do n't think about my mother , " he said harshly . " Darling , why not ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a child any more . I grew up last night . I became at last something other than her son  --  do n't you see ? " His eyes were black . In that instant the bridge , the physical bridge which had been down now for hours was set up again between them , the steely tension . Sitting across from each other on the bed , they were actually locked in each other 's arms . " It will never be the same . Every time will be different , " he said with triumph in his voice , " worlds within worlds within worlds . I want the night ! " he cried out , and then in an altered voice , " Do we have to wait ? " " Yes , " Solange said , deliberately breaking the tension between them . " And darling , " she went on ruthlessly , " you must n't be cross , but I 'm having dinner with Fontanes . He called just now . " " Oh " and then after a moment 's pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and went to the window to stare out at the sad courtyard , the balconies opposite , the pot of geraniumsin a tin can on a window sill . " I suppose , " he said carefully , " that you will have to tell Fontanes  --  " " About us ? Of course not . " Francis chuckled , " Fontanes told me that freedom withoutresponsibility was immoral and he told me to take care of you , so there . Let Solange be your responsibility , ' he said . " p 164 " He did ? " They exchanged a look of heavenly complicity , and the moment of danger was past . " Why ? Would he be furious ? " Francis said , coming over to sit beside her where he could take her hand , turn it over and look at it . " No  --  I do n't know  --  perhaps ... " " I suppose he 's in love with you himself , " said Francis with the happy arrogance of the accepted toward the rejected . " Heavens no . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves me , yes , as I love him . But it 's not this , " she said , bending over to kiss the hand that held hers . " And what 's this ? " Francis asked , on the flood of his happiness , because now he wanted words as well as everything else , and did not yet know how dangerous words are . " This ? " she said lightly , " is madness of course . " But at the moment it was not madness . They sat side by side on the bed and hand in hand and knew that love was also there , flowing between them , and that it was not madness , and that it was good . Again Francis felt in the depths of himself that he must find some way of giving back all this , giving it back to what ? To life perhaps . Whenever they were at peace like this  --  for so he had felt when he woke up and looked at her early in the morning , asleep , turned away from him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best is the communication of goodness and so implies responsibility . At present his only responsibility was to her and so he did the one difficult thing he could imagine and got up . " I 'm going to let you work , " he said , " so you wo n't be crosswith me later . I 'm going to leave you . But I 'll come back . " " You 're an angel and I love you , " she said lifting her facep 165to be kissed . Why had she been afraid ? What was there to fear ? Francis was not Jacques . Francis would not need to hurt her to prove his power . Suddenly she felt the tears rush to her eyes . " Bless you , " she said as he turned at the door to see her once more . Of course she did n't work . She lay for an hour on her bed , half awake , half dreaming and it seemed to her now too that the night was far off , a long journey . And she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't wear the dark red rose sent by messenger a half hour later . She put it in a glass by the bed . It was difficult enough to make up her mouth and she did it three times , as if to hide the vulnerable curve . " But my face has n't changed after all , " she told herself , grateful that she looked quite forty-five , quite hard and clear from the outside at least . Francis was relieved to be alone for a few hours , free , and he felt a need to go and look at the river again , to see what was happening out of doors , to the trees and the light . Every hour , he knew , was bringing him something and at the same time taking something away , since his love changed every hour and so it was necessary to have time to think , to realize each thing as it happened to him . His whole relationship to his mother had shifted as a kaleidoscope shifts , for one thing . And when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man of whom he had never thought as a physical being like himself . He could conceive of how violent action might be like this , a consuming hunger and release . His father must have felt like this about flying  --  yes , he thought happily , I am beginning to understand you , Father . He looked at his mother now with a man 's eyes , his father 's eyes , Alan 's eyes . I suppose , he thought , p 166that there are many kinds of love ; it made him immeasurably happy to realize how much he had to learn , and to think that before he died he would give and receive love in many shapes and forms . Just now it appeared to him suddenly in the way the wind moved through the leaves of the plane trees along the Seine , how it took one tree after another and gently shifted all the poise and the pattern , and made it flow . Later in his walk he saw it again in the V-shaped ripple that spread from the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it broke softly against the stone embankment . Everything he looked at had a message and he thought with amazement of all he had missed ; for the message had always been there only until now he had not known the language nor how to read. p 167To CELEBRATE Saul 's arrival from London Solange was giving a dinner party for him and Fontanes ; there was something gala about this meeting between Francis ' dear friend and her own . It seemed altogether a happy occasion , for Francis too , for he had been a little afraid that when Saul came there would be a subtle change in the magic circle he and Solange had drawn round themselves . But actually he was learning that there is a very special pleasure in seeing someone one loves with others present , of sharing a private secret . He stood at the mantelpiece looking at the room and at Solange who lay on the chaise longue in a pale green evening dress with long sleeves which Francis had never seen . Each time she wore something new , it changed her into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every dress , in every mood . " All you need is a unicorn , " he said out of his contemplationof her . " What are you talking about , Francis ? " she asked , charmed to see him like this , charmed by his slightly formal air , lean-p 168ing on her mantelpiece in his dark blue suit , playing the host for this evening . " The lady of the tapestries who was someone 's only desire . . . " Where in the whole world is there anything as beautiful as your throat , he thought ? " Darling , " she said half laughing , " you really must n't look at me like that . It frightens me . " She could feel her heart beating absurdly where his eyes had rested . Lately she had found their love a real miracle . She had rested on it . She had never imagined that a love affair and especially this love affair ( since she was inside it ) could be happy . But she knew that it could n't last , must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became almost too poignant . It was immensely tiring , as if they were living on air or fire . " It 's time they came , " she said sitting up . " Yes , but it 's lovely just waiting here . . . . " He looked around the dear room into which he had stepped long ago to endure her probing questions and finally to raise his eyes to her face . It had been another world , long ago when he was young and unhappy and knew nothing . When the bell rang sharply , they both jumped , unprepared suddenly to meet the friendly eyes . Francis ran to the door to open it himself , filled with excitement and joy at this meetingof all he held dearest in the world . After the introductions , . when they were seated , and the comfortable silence had arrived and Francis passed the Dubonnetwith a serious and responsible air , Fontanes beamed and , including them all in a look , said , " It 's nice to be here , among friends . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel human again  --  " p 169Everything that had been missing in Boston after Persis died is here , Saul thought gratefully : the warmth of Fontanes ' greeting at the door when he realized who Saul was , the inquiringaffectionate glance Solange gave him and above all Francis ' own air of being at peace with himself and the world . His thoughts were interrupted by one of Fontanes ' sallies . " So , Saul , you are in love  --  " " Am I ? " Saul laughed . " I 'm glad to hear it . " " Of course you are . All Americans fall in love with Paris . It 's the coup de foudre . Can you deny it ? " he teased . " No , I sha n't try . " " He just lives at the Bibliotheque Nationale , " Francis said . " I can hardly get him out long enough to go exploring . " " Well , I 'm not in love with the Bibliotheque Nationale , " Saul said , " though it 's great fun trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Job . " " And you have that patience ? Extraordinary character  --  a patient American ! Not like this one here , " he said giving Francis ' shoulder a pat , " this one who wants to turn the world and himself upside down in the first few hours . " " And who does , " Solange said gaily with a tender glance at Francis . " And who does ! " " I suppose you 've swallowed Bergson whole and are on the lookout for another whale  --  did you find Bergson digestible ? " So they talked , and what they said did not have very great importance to any of them , but the fact that they were here togetherseemed to have an importance . Much later when they had had dinner and sat on at the table finishing a second bottle of champagne , Fontanes , his fierce eyes grown tender , began to talk to the boys seriouslyp 170about America . Saul realized that he had almost unconsciously assumed the self-deprecatory air that intelligent Americans assumeamong Europeans , as if he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost ashamed of his humilitywhen Fontanes said gently , " You see , I love the Americans . I always have . It 's not like England , complete in itself , sealed to outsiders . No , the Americanis just man . " " Perhaps , " Francis said , " but not the Bostonian Ameri-can . " " But that 's just a tiny little corner , " Saul answered quickly . From this small rather dark dining room where the glasses sparkled against the purple velvet curtains , he saw in a new perspective the immense plains of wheat , the isolated bare farms , the rather touching poverty everywhere in spite of television sets and big cars , and every secretary with a mink coat . He realized how deeply he loved his country , and even perhaps Detroit , big and brawling and brassy with young power . They had turned to listen to him , sensing the flare of emotion in his quick answer , waiting for what he would say next . " No , what I feel is the immense possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inward growing , I mean , all the civilizing if you will . It 's exciting to be in on that . To know that you are responsible  --  " and then , embarrassed by their close attention , Saul smiled . " I never knew I felt like that before . It must be the champagne . " " Americans have everything except souls . " Francis was lit up with excitement , looking across at Solange now and then with a leap of joy inside him so violent , he could hardlyp 171contain himself , so now he felt he must talk wildly , exaggerate everything so as to conceal the one thing which could not be exaggerated . But really , Francis , " Solange asked , enjoying the argument , " you ca n't talk about a country as if it were a person  --  or lump Americans together  --  is n't it only that a very few peopleexist in the world anywhere whose souls ' , whose inner life , whatever you want to call it , really come into play , emerge , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked turning to Fontanes . " Certainly I would say so . Of course we have betrayed it a million times since Chartres was built , and even then people were betraying it . How restful it must be to live in a countrywhich is still just making its soul not in a country where it is a matter of digging down under layers of filth , centuries of disgusting selfishness and lack of faith . " Out of such anger and self-disgust France has grown to be what it is , Saul thought , enviously  --  out of such passion  --  and that is what I miss in America . " No , " Francis broke in , " I think it 's not a matter of countries  --  atleast we know that now  --  but my whole generation is the dispossessed . We start with nothing , whether we 're French , German or American . Fontanes can growl about faith because he knows what faith is , faith in France for instance . We never had it . The young Frenchman of our age , Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are pretty cynical about the great American dream . We know too much , that 's the trouble , and it 's dangerous to know so much when you have no faith . We do n't even believe in the goodness of human nature any morep 172  --  after the German camps . Most of us have no religion . What is there left ? " " Personal relations , " Solange said promptly . " Yes , " Saul interrupted , " but surely good personal relationsneed a frame , a frame of manners at worst , of belief and standards at best . Where is our frame ? " " There is nothing we can take for granted , " Francis said , " do n't you see ? " Solange and Fontanes exchanged a glance of understanding , of compassion . " Take Gide  --  " Francis went on , " I suppose the root of everything for him was being a Protestant in France , was in breaking away from that frame . We are in the opposite position of searching for a frame , desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , we are looking for something that will force us to be responsible . Communism , Catholicism provide it , provide that frame  --  I do n't see anything else that does . What we all want , of course , is a religion . We want to be possessed , " he ended savagely , looking down and not at any of the people at the table , as if he were engaged in some bitter battle with himself . " And as it is , we do n't even possess ourselves . We are nothing . " " Champagne is a dangerous drink , " Fontanes said after a moment , because they all felt the empty space around them and were afraid . " We 'll go into the other room . " Solange got up . " Eugenie must be dying to clear the table and get to bed . " She slipped an arm through Saul 's and led him out , so he had a chance to say , " It 's so good for Francis to be able to talk like this . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must express it all  --  it 's wonderful that you are here , " he said gently . " You are wise , Saul , " she said warmly . " How are you so wise ? " " No , " he shook his head , " it 's just that I do n't expect so much . Francis makes great demands on life , on himself . " " And on everyone else , " she said with a smile . " You talked about responsibility the other night , " Francis said turning to Fontanes , when they were back in the salon and Solange had stretched out on the chaise longue . " But to whom are we responsible ? Why ? " he asked . Fontanes lit a cigar and smoked in silence for a moment . He looked majestically rooted and sure of himself , like a great tree . " I think we are responsible quite simply to everyone we meet , even by accident on the street , that we are wholly responsibleto each other , in every exchange , even the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Francis , but if it were universally accepted , we should have a fairly decent world , it seems to me . " For once Fontanes had laid away all his mannerisms . It was quite clear that he was expressingin words the essence of his own life , so the words seemed real , the first real words to be spoken . " No wonder my father loved you so much . " Francis looked up to catch not Fontanes ' eye but Solange 's because he was moved . " No wonder he envied you . " Fontanes puffed his cigar , ashamed of the tears in his eyes . I am getting old , he thought , my skin is getting so thin that everything touches me . That is getting old . " Tell me , " Francis went on out of his silent exchangep 174with Solange , " was n't Pierre Chabrier a man who felt alive only in danger ? M. Descharnes at that party said that he hated to think , that he had to force himself to work  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driven to it . It possessed him , as you would say , so it ca n't have been entirely hateful . It was a hunger too  --  " " Like the hunger of an unbeliever like me for God . " Francisfrowned . " How is one to know what is real in oneself ? " " Ah , but the conflict is the reality , " Solange interrupted quickly . " Do n't you see , without it your father would have been an ordinary philosopher , not what he was at all . " " Of course , " Fontanes said conclusively . " What is your conflict ? " Francis challenged him with a smile . And then they all laughed because it was so evident that Fontanes lived in a perpetual state of war with himself and with everyone else on almost every subject . " I 'll tell you a secret , " Fontanes said almost shamefacedly , when the laughter had subsided , " my real conflict is the theatre . Come down to a rehearsal and you 'll see it played out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saul asked eagerly . " Of course . Why not ? " They talked for a while about the theatre , about the plays they had seen and then Solange , who had been thinking all this while , had to go back to say , " About your father , Francis . I must just say this . I believe it was a question of responsibility  --  your word , Fontanes  --  Pierre thought the danger was that men of action are apt to be irresponsible and thinkers incapable of action . He wanted  --  his hunger , if you will , was  --  to make a p 175synthesis and in that I suppose he could have been called an existentialist . " " He wanted to give it back to life , that excitement , that sense of wholeness . " Francis stood up , carried to his feet by this break-through toward understanding . " I felt it in his relation to me always . There was so much in him that he had no way of giving  --  it was that  --  " They all sensed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment fighting an angel or a devil they could n't see . It was true , Francis was in the midst of a struggle , was on the brink of finding something out which he desperately needed to know . The conversation of the evening had brought it sharply into focus , what Fontanessaid about the American being just man , for instance . And all the last days and nights , especially after making love , he had been pursued by the idea that he must find some way of using the love , the power , the awareness which he suddenly held in his hands . " And you , Francis , " Fontanes asked as if he could read Francis ' thoughts , " how are you going to give it all back , you , the dispossessed ? " " Well  --  " Francis sat down again  --  " the dispossessed are not looking for glory , I can tell you that . My father had a great hunger for glory , I understand that now . He wanted to possess man himself . That was his hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis laughed as if he were amazed at himself . " It sounds ridiculous after all this . But I think I want to be a teacher . " The last was said very quietly and with great conviction . " You see , " he went on turning to Fontanes as he might have turned to his father , " what we have left is human relations , as Solange said. p 176And just because it 's all we have , they have to be so good . How shall I say ? It seems to me that in America our human relationsare poor , undeveloped . We do n't ask enough of each other , do we , Saul ? We 're afraid . " Saul leaned forward . " You have to be something to ask anything . We hardly know yet what we are . " " I want to be as close to the roots of life as I can be , as close to reality in the deepest sense as is possible , never to forget humanbeings , not theories of human beings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Francis pulled his ear halfhumorouslylike a clown . It was to hide his joy , his immense joy at having at last come out to the place where he could see the meaning of his life . Solange got up and laid a hand on his shoulder . " It is a real celebration tonight , dear Francis . " " It takes the Americans to make us feel young again , eh Solange ? " Fontanes said reaching for her other hand . " I have n't had such a conversation for years . " " I thought it was because we were in France , " said Saul , smiling his slow smile. p 177FRANCIS CAME BACK to Solange much later , long after twelve , when he had said goodnight to Saul at the door of his room , slipped in with the key she had given him and tapped softly at her door . He came back with all of himself , with all his power and love close to the surface , and this deep new joy , and he did not guess yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , had opened the door into his real life , had brought him through to the place where he must in the end go on without her . But Solange knew . It was a strange night for them both . In the dark , in the very closeness of the embrace , Francis sensed that she was detachingherself from him , and because he sensed this , for the first time he was driven to use sex as a weapon . The serpent is always there ( Solange knew it well ) but he had not yet bitten . Their love-making had been until now pure of poison , the poison of possession , the poison which drives a lover to ask more and more , to demand of sexual passion the one thing it can not give , the communication of one person to another , the real deep meeting . Over and over again Francis reached out to Solange and p 178forced her to come to him , but by the end of the night they had gone far beyond the place where the sexual act is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhaustingbattle which no one wins , which no one can possibly win . And this , if Solange and Francis could have had a child , or come through at the end to the place where a life together begins , might have had its own meaning . But as it was , when the dawn came , they lay apart , empty and exhausted as if love itself had been poured out and was finished . When they woke at nine , they hardly dared to look at each other for fear of what they might see . And it was strange that it was on this morning that the fates had chosen that Solange be forced to admit the affair to Eugenie . She decided that they would have breakfast in the salon on trays . There , in another room , in the normal sunlight , they might find their way back to themselves . Eugenie showed no surprise , which was a blessing . No doubt she had suspected all this for some time . But Solange dreaded the time when they would be alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , as if she had won a prize in a lottery , and not , as she felt , that she had lost something irrevocably . The whole extraordinary devastating night which seemed now like a journey in itself , had passed almost without words . Now , as they sat opposite each other , wounded , words came into play again . " Well , little Francis , " Solange said , deliberately putting the distance , the years between them , " how does it feel to wake up knowing what you want to be , to do ? " p 179Francis stared at her as if he had never seen her before , with an almost hostile look . He drank his coffee down in one gulp and lit a cigarette . " What happened last night ? " he asked her . " Something happened . I think it was my fault . " His tone was icy cold and she imagined for a second that he hated her , but then she knew it was not that . It was shame . It was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said carefully , " perhaps we went beyond the limits . " " It was like rage , " he said almost to himself . " Yes . " He looked at her with a sudden frightful pity which had nothing to do with love  --  at the dark circles under her eyes , at her pure throat in the loose wrapper she wore , at her hands and strong delicate wrists . And he felt a deep shame as if he had done something monstrous . Before he had always felt as if they were both flowering in the night and the morning had held a particular sane and simple happiness . He had wanted constantly to catch her eye , to exchange a half-amused half-tender glance like a confession , to say over and over , " I love you . " Now he hardly dared meet her eyes . " I have a great deal to learn , " he said humbly . " You must forgive me . " Until now it had seemed to him that every night brought its new revelation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of a new mystery with each union . Now for the first time he was aware of the tragic undercurrent of all passion that can lead nowhere but back into itself , that can not in the end be used , be translated back into life , a shared life where love will open again all the doors that this raging desire to possess and to be possessed has closed. p 181 " M. Descharnes said I was a god because I was an American and perfectly free and did n't know what I wanted to do , " Francis smiled suddenly , " but he did n't know . " " What are you going to do today ? " Solange asked . " I think it would be nice to go to St. Cloud and walk around , look at the trees . Why do n't you go back and read or work at your place and have lunch with Saul and then come back for me about four ? We 'll pull ourselves together and everything will look different by four o'clock , you 'll see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , Solange said kindly , " You had better tell Saul about us , sometime . I think we can trust Saul . " But when Francis had left and Solange sat , very straight at her desk , writing letters , she no longer felt kind . She realized that she wished above all that he would go away . She dreaded the next weeks . It was not lack of love now , but fear of the future . Until last night they had been friends as well as lovers ,  --  this was what had made her happy all the last days . Now since last night they were at war , however much tenderness might try to conceal this fact . Oh , there would be moments , even hours of truce , but the fire Francis had seen burning the trees was burning too fiercely and already the blackened branches were beginning to show . The only hope was in withdrawal , gradual withdrawal to some safer region . But this would involve suffering , especially for him . And she could not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it drove her to work and to forget . And yet even when she was hard at work , his voice came back to her , she could hear him saying with such conviction , " It was death taking you from me , " and she had not contradicted him . But in her heartp 182she knew that it was life , not death , which was parting them inexorably  --  and so soon . By afternoon the sky had clouded over , but having decided to go to St. Cloud they were carried by a kind of inertia into going , even if it rained . Solange wore an old raincoat and took an umbrella . They decided to be extravagant and to take a taxi for once , all the long way past the factories along the Seine and over the bridge , to climb the hill and leave them at last far above the city , in this great formal garden . The atmosphere of the day was their own atmosphere , subdued , gentle , making no demands . They hardly spoke . And when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , having left the panorama of Faris behind them , Solange invented a game . " How many trees can you name in French , Francis ? " " I think almost all  --  you see , I used to come here with my father once or twice a year on Sunday afternoons . " And as they walked , he amused himself at the way the chain of names remadeitself in his mind , a litany of trees . Later they stood at the center of several paths , looking down the high leafy walls , the perspective which always moved Francis strangely like music , perhaps because this was a thing never seen in America , requiring centuries to come into its perfect form , requiring care and forethought carried on for many generations . " But why is it so sad here ? " he asked slipping an arm through hers for the first time . " Because you are sad , my friend , " she answered , taking his hand and clasping it into hers . It was icy cold . " Tell me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p 183tell me everything , about your parents , your school , " he asked as if this was one way of finding her again . But it was strange how as she talked , he felt lonelier and lonelier , jealous of all the places , people she had known before she knew him , driven on by curiosity to wound himself again and again on all these things they could never share , dreading even her sudden laughter as she told him how she used to climb down the fire escape at her school and run wildly through the streets at night , just to escape , just to be free . They were walking now across a little wood and came to a clearing where a woman was teaching a group of twenty or thirty small children to play one of the immemorial games which are handed down from generation to generation like the clipped avenues of trees . This game had a song which the children sang in their high reedy voices , interrupting themselves to indulge in spasms of giggles when the time came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearing arm in arm . It was beginning to rain . Solange and Francis stood in the shelter of the trees and watched without speaking , smiling , but at the same time filled with sadness . Yes , why was it all so sad , this summer afternoon with the rain coming , and the grand old park all around them ? Francis shook himself deliberately out of this mood , for he was afraid of it , as if he were sinking into wild tears or , worse , some savage irritation against the passive beautiful woman beside him , with her rather vague smile . " There is something lovely , " he said , to say something , " about formal places , open to the public , about ordinary people wandering about framed by the gardens of palaces never planned for their enjoyment . I 'm glad we came , " he said almost defiantly. p 184But actually he felt lost here , lost everywhere , feeling his way like a blind man . And so hungry for some gesture from her of real tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help me . " " Are you going to be able to afford a car , you and Saul ? " she asked having been following her own thoughts , as they moved on , " you really should see some of France , you know . " They walked quickly now as if something was finished , as if there were nothing more here for them , driven on and away by the children and their innocent game upon which they had made no comment to each other . " We 're getting a car next week . I think we may go down to Chartres and the Touraine for a few days , " Francis said shortly . He had restrained the impulse to turn on her and ask bitterly , " That 's what you want now , is n't it ? To get rid of me , to have me go away ? " His tiredness was so extreme that he stumbled . It was the tiredness which a pilgrim feels at the beginning of his pilgrimage  --  forthe only place where Francis could imagine laying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , was , he thought , on her breast , this woman who walked beside him and was not there . And in the taxi he said , because again he thought of Alan with a sharp sense of recognition , of something like fellowship , " I think Alan may be coming over after all . You know , I 've been writing him steadily to tell him that he must . Only he is in the middle of a crucial chapter and wo n't make up his mind to leave till it is done . He talks now of perhaps getting over by mid-July for three weeks . " " Ah , " she sighed , " I would like to meet Alan . " Immediately Francis was sorry that he had spoken . For he saw with extreme clarity that everything now would be a threat , p 185even Alan , to whom Solange would no doubt talk . When Solange slipped an arm through his amicably , he drew away . He would have liked to scream , " Do n't touch me . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head fell to her shoulder as if the force of gravity itself pulled him down and all his virility was gone , was falling , just so that he could lay his head on her shoulder like an exhausted child . Very gently she caressed his cheek , and he knew by the very delicacy of the caress that as deeply as he was moved , so deeply was she withdrawn . " Hunger , " he said in a strange throttled voice . It was the only word he could find. p 186AFTER THAT WALK Francis ' life changed . It was no longer possible for him and Solange to talk . Every path they chose ended in a barrier or a large sign saying " Detour " . Every current ended in a short circuit . They were glad when Saul was there because they were afraid of being alone together . Solange had decreedthat for the time being at least they should have a pause and he was not to come to the apartment any more at night . Francis had accepted this decision as wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were alone together she resisted by closing herself up , refusing to catch his eye . It was cruel but she could not help it . Francis ' intensity , his brusqueness which had amused her at first , then charmed her and finally conquered her , now irritated her profoundly . In her heart she knew very well that when one begins to want to change a person it means that one has ceased to love them . But still the flowers came , the messages , Francis ' voice a little blurred on the phone , veiled in anxiety , demanding her love and her caring , calling her out of herself , trying to break her will , which was not even will but compulsion. p 187During these days she turned more and more to Saul who had become the only bridge between them , whose presence was almost a necessity , Saul who seemed so poised , so wise , so completein himself . But above all she longed for them both to get off and to leave her alone . She imagined that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to a real communion by letter . There were hours when she longed with an almost physical longing for Persis , when the need to talk to someone , to justify herself , to be reassured was overwhelming . At night she lay awake rehearsing her whole life which seemed to her now a failure  --  at least wherever she had loved most , she had failed , except with Andre at the end . But that was because then tenderness itself became a passion . How had she been able to forget him , even for a night ? The cruelly misshapen body which had come back to her from the German camps . She saw vividly the thick knobs of his knees and elbows , the wrists , the fearful nakedness because it was a nakedness not even of flesh but of bone . After he died she had refused ever to think of this terrifying weakness because it would have been a betrayal of the man himself . But now ridden by guilt , she could think of nothing else . She could hardly see his clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis hated so much had been taken years before and was of a different person . The person who had come back to her after the war was her secret , and their love itself a secret , the sweetness , the poignant sweetness and radiance of the last months when they had sat for long hours in the garden of the clinic where he was , reading poetry , hardly talking , holding hands , amused and amazed by the simplest things , the flight of a bird close to them or the shadow of a leaf . It had had the 188taste of eternity : That was what she had wanted to tell Persis and no one else . Not Fontanes who had wept so bitterly the first time he saw Andre and who would never speak of him after he died because he cared too much . But Persis . Persis would have listened , would have understood . And Andre would say to her now , " Be gentle . Be kind . Do all you can to help . " Oh why why , do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that brings the furies to the window ? Is it because at such times we forget God or love another human being as only God can be loved ? Who punishes and why ? These were the questions she asked herself through the long nights . But seeing the Solange of every day , dressed if anything with greater care , wearing a flower he had sent her , always smilingand teasing him , never yielding to a moment of real kindness , how was Francis to know of the torment she was in ? How was he to read , when all he knew was that he was being shut out ? It was rather like being ill and having hours of respite from pain . And if he managed to get through an hour without thinking of her , he felt it a triumph . He made himself work , wrote letters to America about a teaching job ; he took over the business of renting a car for their trip to Chartres ; he tried to read seriously again , but his magic power of concentration was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate love never entirely hid it . These days were a truce . " When we come back from Chartres . . . " Francis told himself as if some miracle would happen in the interval . But when the bell rang at half past nine on the evening beforeSaul and Francis were to set out , Solange who was fortunatelynot in bed , but reading in the salon , a cup of tea besidep 189her , knew at once what had happened . She had known that the storm must break sooner or later , now that nothing was natural or sane between her and Francis . Very deliberately she closed her book , looked once round the peace of the room , the big white peonies standing on her desk , breathed in its familiar silence as if to arm herself , and went to the door . " Come in , Francis , " she said coldly . " Come and have some tea . " He sat down , heavily in the chair opposite her and waited while she went to get another cup , hardly aware it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact was that he was so charged with revolt and anguish that even if he had looked at her , which he deliberately did not do , he would not have seen her . She had in the last days ceased to be a person at all , she was simply the point where all his pain converged and became intolerable , a magnet of pain . " Well ? " she asked when the silence had gone on long enough . He started violently as if woken out of sleep . " Did I say some-thing ? " " No , you 've said nothing , that 's just it . Is it good , the tea ? " she asked as one might speak to a sick child . " Very good , thank you . " Now he was here , for he had stood for more than ten minutes at the door , without the courage to ring the bell , now he had finally arrived , it was becoming more and more difficult to speak . All the speeches , the violent accusing speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , had left him . He only wanted to lie down beside her and say nothing and go to sleep . Solange had been prepared for a scene , would have almost welcomed it as a chance to get things clear , once and for all . But p 190the man who sat opposite her sipping his tea very carefully as if he were afraid of dropping the cup , this man who had not lifted his head since he came in , who sat in front of her like a heavy weight she must somehow lift and send to bed , this stranger she had once loved , now frightened her . When finally he raised his eyes all she could see was the wound ; she was appalled at what she had done . Quickly she spoke , quickly to bind the wound with whatever she could lay her hands on whether it made any sense or not , " My dear , I think we are both exaggerating a little . Are n't we ? " " Are we ? " he asked with intense bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrasion , and Solange felt this and resented it . She felt hemmed in . " Please be sensible , Francis . " His tragic look seemed to her almost indecent . " You 're quite a sadist are n't you , in your charming way ? " he said putting his cup down on the tray and getting up . For a moment she imagined that he was going to do something violent . But instead he took out the inevitable cigarette and lit it . " I ca n't talk to you in this mood , " she said quietly . " You know very well that is n't true . " She was afraid of the anger she felt rising in her , the anger that rises up when someone is hurt in spite of anything we can do , when someone makes himself our victim of his own will . But now he sat down beside her and took her two hands in his and held them very hard , so hard that it hurt , but she said nothing . " Let me stay here tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to lean forward , his head in his hands . " Very well , " she said after a moment , " but first let me try to tell you a few things , Francis . " p 191So great was his relief that in a little while he would be able at last to lie beside her that he hardly listened to what followed . It is possible that in hell one of the torments is a total lack of communication . People talk to each other and do not hear what is said , but only hear themselves talking . So Solange said what she needed to say and he heard what he needed to hear and these were at opposite poles in reality . " I am forty-five , " she said to herself , " and you are twentysix . That means that my past is almost twice as long as yours , and your future is more than twice as long as mine . This is one terrible difference . " " It 's why I love you , do n't you see ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I ca n't be with you as you want me to be . There 's no real meeting because in reality we are moving in opposite directions . It 's so strange , but in the last days I have felt the past opening more and more vividly . I 've remembered things I thought I had wholly forgotten  --  and this you have done , and yet every one of these intense memories blurs the present just a little , so in a sense the more deeply you move me  --  and you must know , little Francis , that I have been deeply moved  --  the farther I go away from you . Oh dear , " she wrung her hands nervously , " I am not saying what I mean . It is too complicated for words . But do n't you see , when I hurt you , that too drives me away  --  " she ended , helplessly . " It 's too much . It 's too great a weight . I have n't that kind of love to give any more . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent you as I did that night . . . " But what penetrated in all this was the one sentence , " you must know you have moved me deeply . " Much later perhaps he would hear the rest when someone else opened in him the buried truths . Now his physical suspense was too great . The present wasp 192too imminent , his whole being tensed towards one thing and one only . He lifted her off the chaise longue in his arms and carried her to the bedroom . She was not prepared for this , and when he had laid her on the bed , she turned her mouth away . " No , " she said , " no , you have n't been listening , " and then as if to soften the blow , she said matter-of-factly , " Your pajamas are hanging in the bathroom . You get undressed first . " Later he lay with his head on her shoulder , quite still , wide awake , trying to touch the peace he had imagined all these days would be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and rest his heavy head where it rested now . But there was no peace for either of them , only words whirlingin their heads , disconnected from the powerful heartbeat each sensed through the other like a machine out of control that goes too fast . Very quietly , as a nurse , as a mother she drew him to her finally . But she had broken the fierce tide in him and now their love-making was only the binding up of wounds , the giving of sleep to a child . If she had not resisted him at the moment of his pure fire , if she could have given her love to him then , all might have been well . They might have come through to the tenderness they both needed so much from the other . As it was , the great wave broke in tears instead of love . Francis fought the sobs in his chest as if each rib were cracking , rending sobs as purely physical as sex itself , and finally the awful shamelesstears . Even while he cried , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall of her pity , the wall of his impotence . Now he could never take her again without the memory of these tears between them like a curse . " My darling , do n't  --  do n't  --  " she murmured , " I ca n't bear it . " p 193 " I 'm so sorry "  --  his teeth were chattering  --  " I ca n't help it . " Finally she brought him a glass of red wine and made him drink it . They sat beside each other in the bed , sipping from the same glass . " What was it , Francis ? Why ? " she said when the dawn finally came and they had found no sleep . " I do n't know . Do n't ask me , " he said . But what good was pride now ? He was stripped down to nothing , to a child , or a monster since he was not a child . In his heart he knew and she knew through the masks of tenderness that whatever they still had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flowing out of real communion had been violated twice , once by her refusal of him , again by his breakdown . They slept in each other 's arms , but they were strangers now. p 194JUST BECAUSE he was so tired , numb with tiredness , everything seemed extraordinarily vivid to Francis when he and Saul set out for Chartres the next morning . They started early and there were hardly any cars on the road . It was a still hot day wearing a faint blue haze , and Saul , who was driving , slowed down often to look at a house or a tree , or in Versailles at the immense flight of stone steps which seems to mount straight to the sky . When they passed a grove of poplars set out in straight lines , the light trembling like raindrops on the leaves , he said , " What I shall miss most when we go back is the trees . . . " " And the old stones , Saul . Do you realize how angular and sharp everything is in America by comparison  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had just been cut  --  " So they talked and looked and rejoiced in this new freedom of having a car . Paris already seemed far away . For Francis the relieffrom tension , even these few miles of space between him and Solange , acted like a beneficent drug . He relaxed . And as he relaxed he began to remember . He saw in his mind 's eye the salonp 195where he and Solange sat the night before , drinking tea , saw it in perspective , the Louis fourteenth chairs , the little silver box , the big bunch of white peonies on the piano , all this atmosphere of quiet elegance , of repose , and in the center of it Solange herself whom he looked at as if she were reflected in a mirror , one step removedfrom reality . From this brief distance already she was becoming a myth and it was not to be believed that he had ever held her in his arms . Now that it was too late he overflowed with love and homage . He imagined that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser and calmer and more worthy . Lost in the paths of the imagination , he really believed this and so found peace . In a little over an hour they came out into the plains of the Beauce , the rich pattern of fields unbroken to the sky , open to the wind so the green rippled now and then and flowed in gentle waves . Some of the fields were shot through with daisies and poppies and bachelors ' buttons and looked like stained glass , or the blue-green was interrupted by a square of bright yellow mustard . All this was shining , rich and peaceful . They hardly expected to see suddenly rising above it , alone , the two amazing spires of the cathedral , like magic spears of some heavenly wheat themselves . Then they agreed that it was time to stop and breathe the air , to stand with their feet on the earth for their first look at Chartres . " I guess a cathedral is the only thing that could stand over a field of wheat and surpass it . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the grain elevators are rather grand . It 's not the same thing , of course , but they are splendid , you know . " " But surely , Saul , you do n't feel compelled to get closer top 196them . They 're static . They 're not magnets . Look at those spires , they 're magnets . " Francis was uplifted by his joy . " Yes , " Saul said reflectively , " and they 've been magnets for such a very long time . That 's what 's moving . We 're two out of so many , for so many centuries . It makes one feel part of an endless pilgrimage  --  " he ended , looking up rather shyly to see how Francis would take this . " I 'm glad we 're together , " Francis said , " it 's nice , is n't it ? " and he gave Saul 's arm a fraternal squeeze . And then as if everything that touched him deeply must include his love , Francis said , " Sunlight  --  wind  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one want ? I think it 's finished with Solange , " he said getting into the car . " Oh , " Saul drove on slowly . " In one sense finished . I 've really been like a thief trying to steal or borrow someone else 's life , something already made . But it 's not my life is it , Saul ? " he said , turning to his friend . " It 's too easy . " " It does n't seem to have been exactly easy , " Saul answered with a smile , and then with a slight thrust , " You 're such a romantic , Francis . It all has to be so important . " " It 's my life . That 's important  --  at least to me , " Francis answeredquickly . " Do you ever think about Ann ? " Saul asked , because drivingin a car it is possible to ask certain things one could n't ask anywhere else . The spires had disappeared behind a grove of trees . They were alone again . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Francis said briefly . He did not like to think about Ann . It made him uncomfortable. p 197 " Ann is not complicated , subtle , difficult , and twenty years older than you , " Saul said , keeping his eyes on the road . " Ann is like sunlight , " Francis said , but at the instant he said it , he remembered her pinched masklike face the day of their disastrous walk , the thin snow falling , the meagre air everything had . And in a flash he realized that something of what Solange had done to him , without meaning to , he had done to Ann . " What more do you want ? As you yourself said just now , " Saul pursued pitilessly . " I suppose I want the moon . I do n't want Ann . " He was annoyed with Saul for bringing this up just now . He looked out at the old rich country all around them and thought , This is what I want . Beside Solange Ann seemed like a child . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the secret , the strange things , all that gaiety rooted in sadness , all that beauty haunted by eternity just because it could not last . " I suppose I am a romantic  --  Solange says so too  --  but is that a crime ? " " Not necessarily . It depends on what you do with it . " " My dear man , one does what one can , " Francis said moodily . " One does n't choose to fall in love . It happens . " " Yes , but one might also say , it happens because of certain choices one has made or not made , " Saul said . At this moment the spires came into view again and they were silent . Now one could see clearly the plain denuded spear and its Gothic sister . Francis was glad to become absorbed in less personal thoughts . Already his peace of the morning , his lucid peace was troubled . Already he was eager for reassurance , for some word from Solange  --  she had promised to write . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they were drawing near to the town and the cathedral stood over houses not wheat fields , and then disappeared as they began to climb the narrow streets . When at last they came out into the square and the small magnetshad become huge triumphant fingers pointing to the sky , when they had stood craning their necks , when they had parked the car , they instinctively made their way inside , hardly stopping to look at the grave stone saints that greeted them at the door . They hurried in , not prepared , full of curiosity , and separated at once . The immense height , the glass flowering and blazing above his head , the stillness , this huge shell which was filled every day and night with the presence of God made Francis sit down , at first hardly daring to look around him , as if it were sacrilege to stare rather than to feel . Human will , even the will to understand a piece of architecture , at first seemed to have no place here . Francis put his head in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only prayer he knew . Saul , less vulnerable , more learned , for he had studied the cathedral in photographs , walked slowly around in an ecstasy of recognition , it was all so much more beautiful than he knew , and yet all familiar . The windows were as unlike the colored reproductionsas a living face is unlike a photograph . Here the light becamemusic , sounding through the stone like music , repeating itself in long shafts that laid their flowing carpets on the floor . Saul made no prayers but he was filled to the brim with joy . How Persis would have loved this , he thought , and wondered how many times if ever she had come here . This reminded him to look for Francis , whom he found exactly where he had left him , sitting quite still , lost apparently in his own thoughts. p 199Then they walked all around the cathedral , once together , without saying a word . For the first time since the evening at Solange 's when he had suddenly known what it was he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given him , that his feet rested on a firm foundation . Here where so many others had found the strength to rededicate themselves to God , after his single and rather mechanically repeated prayer which he made in deference to the place , Francis had felt a new certainty about his vocation . Nothing but the essential person could stand here , or kneel here if he had the strength to kneel . And if Francis prayed at all in the true sense of the word it was his half murmured " Help me to be more human . " He did not that first time see Chartres at all , but he was penetrated by the spirit of the place . Even in their slow walk round , he really saw nothing . But he felt everything . It was strange to come out into the sunlight , to the disgusting smell of gas from the exhaust of an old car , to people talking in what seemed like loud voices , to life not stripped down to its essence , but clothed again in its complicated rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Saul said as they got back into the car to look for a hotel . " I wish she knew what I am going to be , " Francis said . For the first time since the funeral he saw her clearly as she had been the last days , free from all his own feeling about her , free to be herself for him , and apart from him , as if a cloud had been dispersedbetween them . " She was such a teacher herself , " Saul said , " I guess that 's where you get it from . She taught me everything , I sometimes think , just by being what she was . " " I 'm nothing yet , " Francis said , " but in there just now , I p 200thought I knew what I can be . What I want is to make a bridge between all this and what it means , all the old riches , even Solange perhaps , and what we have in America , not to be one thing or the other , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a choice , but to be what I am , part of both and so perhaps able to make a bridge . We need all this so much , do n't we Saul ? " he said looking out tenderly at the base of the spire which he could just see from the car . They had stayed where they were , deep in this conversation . " Yes  --  and it does n't need us , " Saul said . " That 's the point is n't it ? Even about Solange . It 's all finished here , and we 're beginners . On the whole I 'd rather be a beginner , you know . " " I would too . It 's harder , " Francis said quickly . " You old Puritan , " Saul laughed and with that they drove down the hill again to look for a hotel . For the next days they spent hours buying reproductions , books about Chartres , studying the cathedral together , then going off in the car for picnics in the fields , happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had found the first day . Such collisions happen only once . A beam of sunlight fell across the page of manuscript Solange was reading and dazzled her eyes . All morning she had held off the thoughts that pressed at the back of her consciousness , she had forced herself to work . But the beam of sunlight bringing another dimension to the flat printed page made her stop reading . She lifted her eyes and looked out at the court which the conciergehad just sloshed down with water and which now reflected the sky in pools of blue . She pushed open the window and smelled the fresh summer air . It was going to be a fine day. p 201But she could not enjoy it , she was too sad . Ever since Francis had left , she had been warding off this sense of oppression , and now it was there . It was useless to go on reading . Her mind regis-teredthe words but not the meaning and the thoughts burstthrough , the thoughts she must face sooner or later . For once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of the pigeonholes and opened her pen . She had promised to write and now she must do it . She must try to find the words , to tell him  --  what ? Nothing but the precise truth would do , the rational truth . The time for allowing sense or feeling to show the way was past . But even as she formulated one sentence after another and cast it aside , she realized that there was no pinning down such things in words . Her feeling about Francis was confused , multiple , every statement could have been followed by its opposite . And at the bottom of it all lay a fierce resentment . She had built up a small reserve of peace and joy in the last three years . She had managed to remake something of a life , after all . Now all this had been thrown open as if it had no value , thrown open , invaded and sacked . Oh , it was all very well for Francis , he was at the stage in life when he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor force which would drive him to think , which would light up his whole world and where even disaster in the end would only be grist to his mill . He is so masculine , she thought , bitterly . Does he have any idea , I wonder , how different love is to a woman , what a price women pay for love , rooted as it is deep inside them , not a mere release of excess energy , but something to be contained , received , and always involving human responsibility ? She did not want to be responsible for Francis . She resented being responsible . She resented the demands he made upon her , resented being forced to give more than she had to give. p 202No , it was quite impossible to write him the kind of letter he expected . And hating herself for what she knew would be anything but balm she wrote quickly and without stopping . Only people who are foolishly brave or simply foolish dare to write real letters . The risk is too great . Only the inexperienced believethat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too wise to be able to write to Francis simply from her heart and Francis was much too inexperienced to read between the lines . He weighed each word as if it were an immortal substance , the exact equivalent of Solange 's feeling . As such , it seemed to him incredibly cruel , a deliberate blow . " Dear Francis , " he read , " you have been gone two days and life begins to have its normal proportions again . I have been getting through a load of manuscripts , and as usual wondering how there can be so many bad writers , so many people who go through the labor of writing and yet have nothing to say . I ca n't help resentingtoo the influence of American literature on ours at this moment . Have we been so nourished on violence and hatred in the last years that we can not taste any more the discreet , the reserved , above all the expression of anything except violence and filth ? It 's almost as if writers had to vomit out in their books what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human nature is a mixture but surely it is time we stopped isolating all the elements of brutality and impotence ? What do you think ? It seems to me that we have talked very little , you and I. Fontanes says to tell you he expects you to be back for the dress rehearsal of his play , as you are probably the only person alive who will see what he sees in it ! He has grown very fond of you , you know . That is all the news . It is a lovely day here and I imagine you and Saul ( you must look up Peguy 's poem on the Pilgrimage to Chartres , by the way ) wandering round the dear old town and going into the cathedral at all hours , to see how it changes in all the lights . Do n't be sad . I hate it when you are sad . Be happy and know that I am yours , with much affection , Solange. " p 203Unfortunately Saul had gone off by himself to study certain things in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had waited for it with a rising impatience that became like an obsession , hanging round the desk whenever a mail was due , ashamed of his eagerness , filled with love , and a humble sense of inadequacy , wanting to pour over Solange the little source of goodness and patience which he had found in himself the last days  --  and now , there was nothing in him but a black rage . The image his imagination had been so busy building of her , which had almost concealed the real person , was shattered . This , then , was the real person , incapable of generosity or understanding , " a bitch , " he said aloud , with satisfaction . His anger was a protection against the hurt , the awful hurt in this letter . Am I mad ? he asked himself . Did I dream all the rest ? He remembered her sleeping face , so beautiful in sleep , in the early morning and the wild tenderness he felt when he looked at it . And then he rememberd his tears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could she ? " With much affection , " " Be happy , " they were stabbing words . Without a moment 's hesitation because his only deep need was to be in communication with her , on any level , and quickly Francis began to write . " Dear Solange , " he wrote , the words tumbling off the pen , " You can imagine the joy with which I saw your handwriting at last . But this letter sounds so far away , so unlike you , I am staggered . What does a word like " happy " mean ? How can you expect me to be happy now ? Or for a long time to come ? How can you use such a word unless you use it only as a weapon and to wound ? It 's just now that I need your love . I know that something irreparable happened that last night , but do n't you see , just becauseof that , I need some reassurance , some word that comes fromp 204your heart ? It 's all very well to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I come back , pleasant **25;4825;TOOLONG  --  I can just imagine them . I may be a fool and a child but I am not absolutely without feeling . I love you . I am willing to do almost anything , even to go away , but not for nothing , for a few cold little words . Do all our nights and days and the trees on fire end in your " affection " ? Please believe me , yours faithfully  --  Francis . " Without rereading it , Francis closed the envelope and tore out to the post office . There was no voice inside him to say " Wait " , to say " be careful . You ca n't do this sort of thing to love which is always and at every moment of the day and night endangered , in peril . " He did not know . He imagined that one can write letters as one talks , walking up and down in a room , where what remains is a stream of emotion , and not a series of imprinted hieroglyphs which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of the intellect . If he did not tell the truth to Solange , to whom could it ever be told ? Pride between lovers seemed to him irrelevant . And he was delighted when the letter was safely posted. p 205FAN CIS WAS GLAD that he would see Solange for the first time with other people , at the dress rehearsal of Fontanes ' play , that he would see her with Fontanes whose presence always seemed beneficent , for she had n't answered his letter . Saul and he were both eager to get back now . They felt they had been away a long time and Paris seemed like home . Just once they stopped in the open fields to take a last look at the cathedral . Then Francis raced the car forward  --  how had he been able to stay away six long days ? " I suppose in a way work is a drug , " Saul said when they were almost there , driving along the Seine past the Renault factory . " Holidays are dangerous because they show one exactly where one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrow in the library again . " " You 've been depressed , have n't you ? " Francis asked , for Saul had been rather silent for the last days , but he so rarely wanted to talk about himself , Francis had hesitated to probe . " Yes , " Saul said with a shy laugh , " I suppose you might call it depressed . The real trouble is that I like it too well here  --  I never want to go back . It worries me. " p 206 " I would n't worry yet , " Francis said in a fatherly tone of voice , " after all , you may feel differently at the end of the year . Meanwhile for heaven 's sake enjoy yourself and do n't acquire an adopted New England conscience . " " I 'll try . . . " but Saul could never express in words his loneliness , his sense of isolation . He would never be able to go back to his own roots , such as they were , to the country club fake Tudor house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that he was intellectually justified in making a complete break , but he was frightened of the vacuum . What he really most wanted was the sort of life Francis had been given by the gods , all that the house on Mt . Vernon Street meant . " The trouble is that when one is n't working , everything becomes a question without an answer . Do you think it 's , an Americanweakness that we get so scared when we have five minutes ' leisure ? " Francis asked . " I do n't think so really , " he answered himself as Saul was silent , " I think it 's natural to want to be useful , to be part of something . Otherwise what 's it all for ? " And then as if there were some connection , " this business with Solange for instance  --  the expense of spirit in a waste of shame  --  why ? " " You wo n't regret all that in the end , " Saul said , glad to think of someone else 's problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I suppose so . At the expense of someone else . Oh Saul , " he said angrily , filled with self-disgust , " I 'm so tired of being inadequate , of always hurting people . What 's wrong with me ? You never do . " " I 'm so much more passive . I expect so much less . I think it takes a long time to balance your fierce kind of energies . But you 'll be a good teacher , Francis , I 'm sure of that . " " How can you be ? I 'm just a mess . " p 207 " Very few teachers have your intensity ; very few care as much , ask your kind of questions , admit their conflict as honestly as you do . You 'll never be just an intellectual , " he said with an ironic reference to himself , " you 'll always be digging . We could have done with some teachers like you , Francis , you must admit . " He chuckled . " God , how bored I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bore the kids even if you do scare them almost to death ! " Then they laughed and spent the next half hour till they drove up to the pension , remembering the horrors of school , and feeling suddenly emancipated , grown up , in the midst of life . Francis was almost sorry as the pressure of the evening began to make itself felt , the ordeal before him , what it would be like to be plunged back into the atmosphere of Solange . He felt himself with every hour dragged down into the subterranean caves of his conflict . Would it ever be over ? They pushed their way through the crowd in the lobby a good ten minutes before curtain time . Solange was sitting alone , framed by the empty seats one on each side of her . She looked unfamiliarin a new rather extreme hat . " Hello , Solange . " Francis was filled with a sudden quietness of having arrived , of having found her there , waiting , this power she had still of making the whirling kaleidoscope of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as tangibly as her small gloved hand pressed his politely in greeting . " You 're in good time . Fontanes will be pleased . " She spoke quickly , a little nervously perhaps , pointing out to Saul various celebrities around them . She hardly turned to Francis . " You have a new hat , " he said accusingly . " Yes , do you like it ? " She smiled as she turned to show it offp 208but it was an impersonal smile , the smile of a model in a hat . " I suppose so . But what happened to the black hat ? " He wanted her always to stay as he remembered her . This new hat with its inference of the lapse of time , disturbed him . " Oh , that was a spring hat . It 's summer now . I wore the other much too long really . " It was absurd to mind so much , and yet this new hat seemed to him ominous as if it were the symbol of an inward change , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her . " You mean you 'll never wear it again ? " he asked , in spite of himself , in a tone of great anxiety . And Solange laughed and turned to Saul , to say quite lightly and casually , " Francis is so intense about everything , even a hat . " The words stabbed and Francis was grateful when the lights went down and he could sit beside her in the dark and observe her face as if now that she did n't know she was seen , it might have some message for him . But the only message was his own love which came back to him as if he had never known it before , like a marvelous illness making everything extraordinarily brilliant . They had to stand around quite a while after the theatre was emptied and all the big cars had rolled away and the knots of people and their loud voices had dispersed . They stood in the empty lobby and waited for Fontanes . Saul had valiantly borne the brunt of the conversation and he and Solange were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one actor 's performance . " It 's a shallow performance , " she said bitingly . " He 's one of those actors who can express everything , so there 's no tension anymore . It just pours out , superficial  --  a monkey , in fact . " Francis did not like her in this mood . She seemed to himp 209suddenly French , even the timbre of her voice light and dry , French in a way he had never used the word before , in a derogatorysense . Not once in these long hours had he met her eyes . But Fontanes was upon them now , and they were carried off on the stream of his affection . " What did you think of it , Francis , dear boy ? " he said seizing Francis in his hands and facinghim with a bold inquiring glance so he could not escape . " God , he is serious  --  was it as bad as all that ? " Finally they were seated in the back room of a little restaurantnear Les Halles where Fontanes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , had had to hear all about the children and the Patron 's varicose veins , and now devoured an omelette while the others drank burgundy and onion soup . Francisforced himself then to say what he thought of the play . He felt that he was being judged by Solange this evening so he becamein spite of himself an actor , overplaying his part , overemphasizingeach point as he tore the second act to pieces and overpraised one of the actors . He knew he had made a fool of himself when at last he subsided into silence . " Bravo ! " Fontanes said , laughing with joy . " The boy can talk , eh Solange , when he once begins . Hear , hear ! Unfortunately , " he smiled slyly , " I think you are dead wrong , but never mind . You are five times as intelligent as the critics , so I shall be lucky if I escape with my skin , " he said , suddenly moody again . " The author has gone off with Claire l'Ambre , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ) . " Poor boy , the claws of the tigress are in him now , and I could do nothing . It 's terrible to be young , " he said turning to Francis . " What hell ! Thank God , I 'm too old to be disturbed by your angelically disdainful air , Solange , " he said , enjoying himself hugely . " You did n't like myp 210play , did you ? You thought , The old fool has allowed his enthusiasmto run away with him again , for the five thousandth time , but that is the way the good , the beautiful things come about , through the five thousand chances one takes  --  you wait and see ! My little Belgian will write a good play someday , a play that will make his fortune  --  and someone else 's too  --  because an old fool believed in the beginning , " and his eyes blazed . " My dear , my dear , " said Solange , lifting her glass to him , and smiling mischievously , " as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , " said Fontanes , equally mischievously , " luckily I did n't know or I could n't have made my little speech . " Then he laughed a rather rough harsh laugh , full of pleasure . " What actors we all are , even little Francis here . I would never have believed it . " " But Francis is a ham actor , " said Solange in her mischievous mood , biting as a fox bites for she felt his eyes , the eyes of the hunter on her , asking a question she could n't answer . " Do n't , " Saul said quietly . " There , you see , Solange , " Fontanes said severely , " we have gone too far for these delicate American skins . But they are real friends . They defend each other like Roland and Oliver . I like that . And I must say that Francis is not a ham actor , not at all , " he ended , gathering them together in his gigantic smile , forcing the peace , his peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility . As a matter of fact , Francis was in a daze . The excitement of seeing Solange again , the play itself , and now the wine and all this talk made him feel confused , half angry , half sad , wanting only to get away . When they were out on the street he heard Saul say quite firmly , p 211 " Francis will take you home , Solange . " He even found a taxi and opened the door for them . " No , I want to walk a bit and clear my head . " He slammed the door shut with a sense of triumph . Now if only Francis will be calm , he thought , if only he will . " What is this play you are directing ? " Fontanes asked him . " Come along , I 'll walk with you . I 'm too excited to sleep . You really should n't order people around like that , " he said half smilingin the dark , " they may not like it . " " I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed now at his courage . " Only I think it had to be done . " " Yes , all right . Do n't tell me , " Fontanes said suddenly . To certain things he was so sensitive , this powerful old man who could roar like a bull , that he could not speak of them . He was too fond of Solange not to see that she had behaved strangely all evening , and not perhaps quite kindly , and he minded . They walked on in silence , a little apart , until Fontanes , as if he were forgiving them both , slipped an arm through Saul 's and said quite softly and tenderly , " You see , Solange has suffered too much , too much for one person . Sometimes suffering makes people hard . She has seen too much  --  this second war , her husband who came back from the infernal camps like a ghost , worse , like a living man who has died and still lives . Oh Saul "  --  the bitterness rose up again and choked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been done to human beings by human beings ! How shall we ever be able to live , to love ever again ? I brought Solange back to life . I insisted that she live , but I sometimes wonder what for  --  she has many masks , has Solange , but under them all , there is a frightfulemptiness . Have you seen it ? " " No , " Saul answered . " I hardly know her . " " Francis has seen it , " Fontanes said sadly . " It 's rather life p 212the Medusa , you see , " he went on walking a little faster and pantingslightly as if he were making an effort , a physical effort to speak , " if you see it , it freezes your soul and here in Europe we have all seen it . Only you Americans have not  --  " And then squeezing Saul 's arm till it hurt , he went on , " You 're both too pure for this old world , too young , too vulnerable . You will be hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish heart full of compassion . . . " After that , they walked on in silence . " I could bellow my rage and despair into the night , " Fontanes said , but the voice he said it in was tired , tired and old . And Saul knew that he was near to tears . Another sort of silence bore , Francis and Solange through the empty city streets , an interminable journey to them both . Small talk was impossible , and Solange was quite determined not to say anything of importance . Once she pulled her gloved hand away from Francis ' open eager one . Once she said , " Ah , the Tuileries , we 're nearly there . " " It was good in Chartres , " Francis said humbly , " I thought a great deal  --  about us . Forgive me for my letter , " he said , but he knew that he was putting offerings before a goddess of stone . " There 's no forgiving or not forgiving , " she said quietly . " But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " Yes . " And that was all . When they came to 18 Rue de l'Universite , she hurried in with hardly a good-bye , leaving Francis to pay the taxi , and to stand alone in the dark street , his heart like an empty pocket. p 213v WAS NOT the letter and Solange knew it was n't . Without being able to help it , she solicited violence from him : her withdrawalwas a violence . Why then ? Where was the flaw ? For Solange , in spite of all she said , being a woman , would never blame passion for her own failures . She blamed herself bitterly for being unable to serve this passion well , so young , so violent , so immeasurably greater than anything she had now to give it . For I am a desert , she reminded herself , as she undressed , very slowly , flinging her clothes as if they did n't belong to her wherever they might fall in this mood of self-hatred . She knew that to serve passion well , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a poison , and wholly destructive , the heart itself must open to the core . This is what the implacable goddess asks , this and no less , no substitute of tenderness , none of the more subtle shades of love , but simply the Absolute . Once , when she had found Francis sitting in the cafe and had opened her eyes to his deep searching look , she had felt it possible to give what she had imagined she had no longer in her possession , a whole heart , without questions , a self made whole again by his love . Though even then , so longp 214ago , she had been afraid , she had wanted to run away  --  No , no , she said to herself turning and turning as she tried to go to sleep and forget , love does n't fail , it is we who fail , riddled with weakness and fear . And in her case , persistent demanding memories which would never leave her wholly free . All this she saw clearly when she was alone , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze up , become implacable , say things she did n't mean , because when he was there her own conflict became unbearable . She was torn in two . His very presence had become an impossible demand , his suffering an accusation . Worse , she came back always to Persis , to the fact that she was responsible to Persis for all this . And what would Persis say now , with her clear eyes ? But even she had not loved Francis well enough . Too much and too little , waking in him a hunger which she wondered now if anyone would ever be able to nourish . If so , she thought , with a flash of real insight , it would be someone with no memories or with memories which he could share , above all someone young , someone whose existence would not always be years and lives apart from his , someone with whom he could use all the rich parts of himself which he could never bring into play with her , real responsibility , fatherliness , and sharingof simple things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-respecting quality . In that long night in which Solange forced herself to face it all , there were hours of tears , the tears of parting , when she knew how deeply in spite of all her revolt he had entered into her , what secret fibres of her being he had taken into his possession . She buried her face in the pillow as if to shut out his dark tense face , so complex and mysterious when in repose , so simple and young when he smiled p 215And when the dawn came she had passed forever one frontier . She knew that she would never love anyone again in this way ; this part of her life as a woman was finished . It is a harsh frontier for any woman to pass , and Solange 's face bore the marks of the harshness when she got up the next morning . She looked at her face with a horror of growing old , of all the years to come , of the loneliness . And it was not for her to see , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her face had grown beautiful in the night , as if the soul were a little closer to the surface than it had ever been , and looked out quietly from her tired eyes . She had made her peace with herself , but to make peace with Francis , to try to help him out onto his real path without her , that would be more difficult , so difficult that she trembled and she was not prepared for Fontanes ' phone call at a little after nine . " Did you make your peace with Francis ? " he asked cheerfully . " My dear , that is really not your business , " she answered , suddenly angry . It was rather like having to face an Old TestamentProphet right after breakfast . It was n't fair . " Of course it 's my business . Pierre 's son will always be my business , and you are my business too , so ? " " So , leave me alone , Fontanes . I wo n't be scolded so early in the morning . Good-bye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked to have the temperament which can relieve itself in a tantrum . If I were Francis now , she thought , half laughing at herself , I would throw this tray on the floor , and that would be that . Instead she called the pension . " May I speak to Monsieur Chabrier ? " " Monsieur Chabrier is out . " p 216 " Oh  --  " her voice must have showed its surprise , or perhaps fear , for the woman at the other end of the wire , added , " He has gone to meet his stepfather at Le Bourget . " So Alan was arriving today . It was like an answer to a prayer . For she could never never talk to Fontanes about all this , he would simply get into a rage and say things they would both regret . But Alan , surely Alan would understand and help . Alan would have been touched if he could have imagined that three people were waiting for him as eagerly as if he were a guardian angel flying in that warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sick . It had been a rough trip . But he was touched to see Francis and Saul waving at him at the other side of the Customs ' . " This is wonderful , " he said and Francis realized what a change had taken place in their relations without his even havingbeen aware of it , for he was just purely happy to see Alan 's familiar rather shy bewildered look . Only , he looks old , he thought , terribly old all of a sudden . " We have a car , you know , " Saul said proudly . " This way , sir . It 's not very grand , but I think we can all three fit in . " " I have n't much baggage . I can only stay three weeks . " " But you 've escaped  --  it 's marvelous . " Francis slipped an arm through his while the porter arranged the bags in the back . " Did you finish the rough draft of the book ? " " More or less . " Francis plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , in a way , to be home again , and only showed some reserve when Alan said that Ann had driven him to the Boston Airport , " so I have been well taken care of at both ends . " They left him at the France et Choiseul where he had stayedp 217years ago , he said , " before I even knew your mother existed , Francis . " " It must have taken some courage for him to come here , " Saul said when they were on their way back to the pension . " It wo n't be easy for him , meeting all your mother 's old friends . " " I know . But I think he 's beyond all that . He will be glad to see the people who loved my mother not as she was loved in Boston , but passionately  --  as Solange loved her . " Francis would have liked to be somewhere alone with Alan , to have him all to himself , almost to be back in the house on Mt . Vernon Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision when Alan met Solange . It was disturbing . And without explaining what he meant , he added , " I never foresee anything . " Saul laughed , " And I always foresee everything , that 's the difference between us . " It was arranged that they all meet again at Solange 's at five . Francis took care to be there fifteen minutes early . " I 'm sorry I was cross , Francis , " Solange had been measuring these words all day for their exact weight , their exact honesty , " let 's be friends , " and she offered her hand . " Of course , " Francis looked away without taking her hand . And then , as if he had really been thinking of something else , " I hope you like Alan . I was terribly glad to see him . But he looks old . You must n't expect too much  --  he 's aged a lot since Mother died , " he said as if he wanted to protect Alan from her gaze , to shelter him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . But then he broke through with his real self as he always would do , " Oh Solange , what days these are , what strange days . . . " p 218 " Yes , my poor friend , " she said gently , sitting down on the chaise longue , but without stretching out as if she too were waiting for the long-expected entrance of Alan , and with impatience . " Is it never going to change , Solange , darling ? " He sat down beside her , taking one of her hands in his with such insistenttenderness that she had to pull hers away , in spite of herself , as if it were a plant trying to root itself and she must not allow it to make roots . " It has changed , dear Francis , it has changed . We go on from here , " she said gently . " Where from here ? Where ? " he asked , getting up and walking up and down as if the room were not large enough to containhim . But just then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer it , Francis . There they are . " Alan came in with his wonderful air of control and calm and kissed her hand , " How very glad I am to meet you at last , Madame . " " And I you  --  dear Saul , sit down , " she commanded . " Francis will get us something to drink . We 've talked so much of you and your coming , that I began to think it could never hap-pen . " " I can assure you , that I thought so too . But suddenly I decided and now I know how right it was . What a Parisian room this is , " Alan said , smiling with pleasure , as if he recognized everything . " It 's a long way from Boston , is n't it Saul ? " " Yes , " said Saul , " except for one room in Boston . " " Persis ' drawing room always had the feel of Paris about it , " Alan explained as Francis came back with the glasses on a tray. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed round the glasses , as if this were a slightly formal occasion . " I think we drink to your mother , Francis , " Solange said looking toward Francis with a smile that was meant for him alone . But in turning her head to find him she met Alan 's glance for just a second . It was a glance which said plainly , We understandeach other . They drank in silence and set their glasses down . For a moment , each of the people in the room in his way felt at peace . It was as if in that moment Persis had passed through the room with her absent-minded air , to look for a book , or to re-arrange the flowers on the mantelpiece , not the dead Persis , but the very living one their memories recreated . None of them alone could have achieved this recreation , but it was because they were together and their feeling communicated itself , one to another , that it happened . " She must always have felt at home here , " Saul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Solange said putting her head a little on one side and glancing up at the photograph on the desk , " but I think she was not one of the Americans who becomes more French than the French . She brought us something all her own ; she stayed herself . That is why we loved her . " Because the atmosphere was right at last , Solange felt able to say what she had never said even to Francis , and she turned to Alan to say it now , " You see , that is why we needed so much to see her  --  after the war . It was foolish , but for a time I felt everything depended on her coming back , life itself , " she said with a shy little laugh as if she were ashamed of confessing so much . " Yes , " Alan said gently , " I know ... " p 220 " A great many people felt as you do about my mother , " Francis said almost coldly , as if to infer that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , " Solange said quickly , " of course . Do you know why ? " she asked them all three . This was the atmosphere which should have been created at the luncheon after the funeral , the dear comfort of speaking of the dead , of rehearsing their virtues , of sharing one 's feeling about them , Saul thought . And it was he who answered , " I think she was really attentive to other people . It sounds so little , " he went on apologetically , " but it 's really rather rare . We are all so busy paying attention to ourselves , but Mrs. Bradford paid attention in an extraordinary way , without becoming involved , that was what was amazing . She was all there for every one of us  --  and yet  --  " " I suppose you are going to say she was detached , " Francis said bitterly . " I am so tired of that word . " He alone stood out , refused to be included in their communion , and Saul felt sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was a deep sigh , " she was wonderfully detached . " " At the end , perhaps , " Solange said quickly , " not when she was young , like Francis here . " " Was n't she ? " Francis asked eagerly . " No one ever told me that . " " Of course not . She used to nearly kill herself playing the piano , practising for Monsieur Cortot  --  if you call that detached . " " But that 's not people , " Saul said . " Even about people , " Solange said quietly , but she did not go on . She did not want to bring Pierre Chabrier 's name into this. p 221 " I think she was never quite detached about you , Francis , " she said , glad of a way out , which was also the truth . " Surely no one can be quite detached when they love , " Saul said quickly . He was afraid now . He was afraid because he sensed how many perils there were for them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive back into a room , it was to bring all the love and all the pain back too . And he was not thinking of himself now . " She was after all , very human . She was n't a saint , thank heavens . " The conviction with which he ended , broke the spell and Alan chuckled . " I wish I had known my mother , " Francis said simply . " I never knew her . She was always a mystery to me . " " Perhaps you were always a mystery to her , " Solange said gently , and she would have liked to take his hand and caress it in some angelic way which would not hurt but only heal . Francis , feeling the change in her tone , looked at her shyly and then looked away . His heart turned over inside him . Alan had been for the last half hour expanding very gently as if he had been wearing clothes a little too tight for him . It was for this he had come , to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh strait jacket of Boston . " Francis is a mystery even to himself , " he said out of this mood of quiet happiness , without malice . " You can imagine what it meant to us all to have him come , " Solange said warmly , " and Saul , too . We have all felt so much younger lately , " and then as if she thought they had had enough of sentiment for one afternoon , Solange changed the subject deliberately , and began to ask Alan questions about his stay , to suggest things he must see , the exhibition at the Orangerie for instance. p 222 " The Impressionists , yes , I must certainly wander in and see that , " Alan said with his Bostonian discretion . " So rich , so alive  --  in spite of all the horrors we have been through . It 's rather wonderful to see that those paintings have not been touched . They just shine softly . " Francis watched as Alan and Solange talked , watched with fascination , for he sensed that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , a whole lifetime of experience . Their edges were worn smooth , and he envied Alan his urbanity , his calm attentive air which concealed so much . Shall I ever be able to behave like that , learn to come into a room with that air of being at ease at once ? That wonderful shining kindness ? Shall I ever not be young ? he thought desperately . It was easier finally to go and leave them to have dinner alone , than to stay and watch . Especially as he carried away with him the remembrance of Solange 's sudden kindness , of her affection as if it were a good augury for the walk they planned for the next afternoon . For some reason when Saul and Francis had left , Solange laughed and Alan moved over to a chair near the chaise longue where she now stretched out , relaxed . " They 're terribly young . " " Well , " Alan said chuckling , " you 've tamed wild Francis . He has learned some manners here , I 'm glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more seriously . And then as he saw the change in her expression , " I hope he has n't been a nuisance  --  or bored you . . . " " Francis is too dynamic to be a bore , " she said quickly . " He disconcerted me at first , I must confess . He 's so sudden and violent . What I like is that he believes in his own life ; he has some curious belief in himself which is in the long run convincingp 223in himself not selfishly but for what he can do in the world , you know . What do you think about this idea he has about teaching , Alan ?  --  may I call you Alan ? It seems that we are old friends . . . " She is very charming , Alan was thinking , and better than that , she has feeling , but it is a pity that Francis is in love with her . " I 'm delighted that he has made a decision . " And then he added , with a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " He wo n't be a bore anyway , " she answered , so happy at last to be able to talk to someone about him that she could hardly stop . " And I think he has a genius for friendship . His friendship with Saul seems to me quite rare , on both sides . Fontanes  --  Oh , of course you do n't know Fontanes but he is an old friend of mine and of the Chabriers  --  he talks about them as Roland and Oliver , " and she laughed . " He has a heroic conception of Francis , dear Fontanes . You know he always believes his friends are geniuses . " Alan poured himself another Dubonnet . " May I ? " and then spoke rather thoughtfully and slowly , " You know , I have always felt about Francis that he was perhaps a genius , but if so a genius with no talent , a sort of comet on the loose . He has tremendous power , but so far it has all been used up fighting himself . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is very good at that . " " It must be hard for you , " Alan said gently , " all this  --  " but he did n't finish the sentence , afraid of having said too much . " Hard for me , why ? " Solange sat up and faced him almost boldly . She had wanted to talk about Francis , about everything , but now she was afraid. p 224 " You must forgive me , " Alan said quietly , " but ever since I came into this room I have had the strange sensation that I knew a great deal about you , partly because of course Persis spoke of you , partly , I do n't know , a very real sympathy . But , " he got up to go , " I think I have said a little too much and now I must be going . " " No , stay , " Solange commanded . " I 've wanted to talk to you for so long . Do n't go yet . Please . " And when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've hurt Francis and I shall go on hurting him . " " Probably , " Alan said quietly , " but someone had to hurt him to bring him alive . In the end he will be grateful to you , as I 'm sure Persis would be . " " Do you think so , really ? " she asked , amazed . For the first time she saw a gleam of light in the jungle in which she had been lost . " You see , that 's what I thought at first , but I had not measured the years , the war  --  you see , Alan , I never shall quite live again . That 's what I did n't know . " It was extraordinary to be sitting here talking to a perfect stranger in this way , but Solange was too relieved to stop to analyze or think what she was doing . She trusted Alan . She trusted him because of Persis , and now in the last half hour because of himself is what Persis told me when I married her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I regret anything ? " he asked almost violently for such a self-contained man . " Ah , but you were both older , wiser  --  Francis is so violently self-enthralled , " she said . " I sometimes think I hardly exist as a person to him . I 've become a myth , a projection of all sorts ofp 225hungers and needs in him . He does n't see me , " she said , " he does n't hear what I say . He does n't know what I am . " " He ca n't  --  not yet , " Alan said quickly , " Give him time . Wait , my dear  --  " " And perhaps , " she said half to herself , " I have n't told him enough , " thinking of Andre again , of all Francis did n't know , of all she could n't tell him , perhaps ever , because he did not want to hear . " We do what we can , " Alan said gently . " But I have thought sometimes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal when his mother died . That was his second great wound . The first was her second marriage , " he said impersonally , " but he was too young then . " " And I am the third ? " she asked with a wan smile . " It 's not easy to see the young suffer  --  and yet , " Alan said , " where would we be without our suffering ? What would we know , you and I , if we know anything at all ? I would n't worry , " he said changing his tone , and becoming rather matter of fact , " Francis will be all right . " " I do care , you know , " she said quietly . " Of course , " Alan got up and went over to the desk where Francis had stood so often , to pick up the photograph of Persis and look at it for some moments in silence . " And so did she , " he said gravely , " and so did she . " " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved sigh . " You know for days and days and nights the furies have been at the window . " " Do n't be too sure they 've gone , " Alan said with a chuckle . " They 're extraordinarily faithful females , the furies . I know . " p 226FRANCIS did not know what he hoped for , except to be included , not to be excluded from Solange 's inner world any more , a world which he associated so closely with Paris and all its beauties , that it seemed as if everything he had looked at with such joy was also now closed to him . It had become a huge empty city , full of strangers and where he was a stranger too . The river , the trees , the great open squares were no longer his possession and even his room at the pension was so filled with his own suffering waiting to pounce when he opened the door , that he hated to stay there longer than necessary . He thought now sometimes of America as a sick person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Alison 's apartment strewn with political pamphlets ; he thought , in spite of himself , of Ann , who after a period of silence had begun to write him long letters which he stuffed in his pockets and forgot , and then suddenly discovered and read avidly , and he sometimes asked himself if he would not see her with wholly new eyes when he got back , now that he was himself a different , a so much more physically sensitive being . But at a certainp 227point his imagination met a blank wall here . Then he stopped walking and ordered a brandy , and once he bought an Americannews magazine to see what was happening in the States , but he was so revolted by the style , the apt sneer , the slick condescensionof the magazine that he found he could n't read it . He realized that this is what he would have to fight when he began teaching , this demand for information in easy doses , this unconscious disregard of all values , these ready-made receipts for the well-informed . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy to think that he would soon be entering a battle . He felt suddenly as if he must hurry and get to work after all the wasted years . And yet he knew too that he would not be able to leave unless he could make his peace with Solange , unless he could feel accepted and not wholly rejected . The afternoon before when Alan had been there , he had had a moment of wild hope . She seemed kinder suddenly , almost as she had been at the beginning . This , he knew , had been made possible by Alan 's presence . In a flash of a second after Saul and he had left he had seen what jealousy might be , how much worse than anything he had until now had to face in relation to her . For the first time since he and Saul were in Paris they went to a night club and got very drunk . Now in the early afternoon after a morning of fruitless walking around in circles , seeing nothing , a little dizzy with his hangover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What must be controlled was the irrational leap of joy whenever he was going to see her , this eagerness for her face , for her eyes , for her hands as if a glance would nourish him , a handclaspmake all well . He knew now that this was not so . He knewp 228it with his mind , knew that almost at once he would become tense with suffering , as he faced the wall she had set up between them , would be filled with rage and a desire to hurt her , to break through . And this was what he must control  --  the impulse to exaggerate , to underline , to try to crash through by violence , even the violence of words . Solange too was invoking all her good angels and they met each other rather meekly , but always with the swift glance which asked , " What is he like today ? " or , " What does she really think of me and will she be kind ? " Nothing was safe or sure any more . " Let 's wander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an old friend . " Let 's go out and wander about Paris , along the Seine perhaps  --  is it going to rain ? " she asked as he helped her into a light coat . He was relieved that she did not look too beautiful , but a little tired like a pencil drawing , delicate but not dazzling . " Yes , let 's wander  --  " he answered . They walked arm in arm , forcing other people off the sidewalk , resting in these moments of peace , like athletes before a contest . They talked of Alan and of Saul , while Francis saw with delight that his Paris had come back to him , and that walkinglike this with Solange everything had again the intensity of a dream , the vegetable store he had stopped to look at so long ago , a crucifix in an antique shop , the narrow perspective of the street itself , straight and bland against a powerful sky of dark clouds , a street full of human beings again . They stopped to play with a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they felt like children escaped from school . The lapse in tension , the lapse in suffering seemed like a reprieve . When they came out to the Seine , the wind was tearingp 229through the trees , turning the leaves inside out , and even the river was ruffled . " What a sky ! " Francis said as if he were eating the wind . " I should have brought my umbrella . " " If it rains we 'll go into a cafe and sit there for hours drinking coffee and brandy , " Francis said happily . But as they walked along , the wind fell suddenly . Until now it had blown the words out of their mouths . Until now they had been absorbed rather happily in the physical effort of walking against the powerful fluid element . Now the silence , the stillnessfelt strange . " Ouf , " said Solange , " that 's a relief . I hate wind . " " Do you ? I love it  --  " " Ah , but you do n't have hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful cropped head which was like a small cap of fur , she thought , and which she always wanted to touch  --  and then rearranged hers and put on her soft felt beret again . They had stopped for this operation . Francis took her elbow very gently and forced her to look at him . For now the time had come when he must be reassured , when he could not wait another minute . " My love  --  " " Your sad love , " she said ironically . But it was enough . A crumb of love is enough , now , he thought without shame . If she only knew . And they walked on , without talking , glad not to talk . Every step they took together was healing , every moment of silence brought them closer one to another . As they approached Notre Dame the sun broke through and lit up the spire like a spotlight and they stopped to lean on the p 230parapet of a bridge and watch the great clouds moving over , remembering the day when they had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowed  --  when it was not a matter of crumbs , but oceans . " It has been a long journey , Solange , " Francis said gravely . But though it was a statement and not a question , she was sorry that he had spoken . Sensing his eyes as she had felt them once before like hands on her cheekbones , on her eyelids , Solange drew away from him . The wall was there again . She could have cried out , " I ca n't help it , do n't you see ? I ca n't help it . " But the reserved closed mouth , the withdrawn eyes told him nothing . The brilliant sunlight splashing down on the cathedral , turning the river blue for a moment , seemed a mockery . A little further ahead there was a small crowd gathered on the bridge looking down at something below , and they walked on fast , glad of something to look at now , outside themselves . It was not possible any more to walk arm in arm . " Perhaps someone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that would draw a crowd all right . " Now they were at the bridge , they turned in eagerly to see what was happening . Just below them in the underworld where Francis had walked with his joy in his hands , where he had left a package of cigarettes  --  how long ago ?  --  there on the stone pavementby the river two women were locked in a frightful embrace , the embrace of rage like two beasts . A circle of men , cigarettes hanging out of their mouths like the audience at a cockfight , hands in pockets , stood and watched , some of them smiling , and even here high up on the bridge they could hear the curses . The woman on top picked up the other woman 's head by the hair and banged it down on the stone , not once , but five or six times as ifp 231she were going to kill her antagonist there and then while the men smoked and stood at ease , their hands in their pockets . Francis froze to the marrow . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings stripped down to nothing but bestial need to destroy and punish , that it was fascinating . He did not look at Solange . He dragged her away without a word . They ran across the bridge as if they were running away from some terrible danger , as if they were pursued , but they could not run away from that devastating image . " I feel quite sick . " Solange sank down on a bench behind the cathedral . " Give me a cigarette . " " I should have done something , " Francis said , with bitter shame . All the images of the camps , of the atrocities human beings have perpetrated on each other in our time were with them now . And just like this , Francis thought , Germans must have run away when violence was done , because they could not face it . It seemed as if something had been done to his own body . He felt violated , because this image of passionate hatred came dangerously close to being an image of passionate love . Solange sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , to conceal it even from herself . But she would have liked to get away from Francis , from everyone , to hide , not to be seen like this  --  above all not to see . " Francis , go and find a taxi  --  we 'll go home and have some tea , " she said calmly . " That was rather a shock , I must say . " The furies are never very far away , that was what Alan had said . She looked up at the flying buttresses and the lovely spire , the beauty no human ugliness could touch , the image of consolation and purity , but it all seemed false , a facade built to hide the horrible truth , which is that the beast is always therep 232just under the surface , however we may sublimate or romanticize . We are all guilty , she thought , all of us . And perhaps it is better to be reminded of it . Why did this have to happen today , Francis thought , bitterly , why did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked himself , not even disturbed by the distance between him and the woman who sat thinking her own thoughts in the other corner of the taxi , because the distance was so absolute . It was as tangible as if a sword had come down out of the sky and cut them apart . " My poor Francis , " she said when they were finally sitting in the familiar room , drinking tea , " you look shaken . " " Not exactly , " he said , " I feel guilty and dirty , I do n't understand why . " Solange sighed and lifted her chin in the gesture he rememberedalways with tenderness , and looked off out of the window at the piece of cloudy sky . " None of us can stand very much reality , " she said lightly , " we have weak stomachs , Francis , we who pretend to be sensitive . " " It does n't seem real , " he said frowning , " it seems like a nightmare . And yet one was involved  --  in spite of oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so horrible . I saw myself there "  --  he put down his cup and sat with his hands on his knees  --  " yes , that was it , " he said , clasping his hands and looking at them as if he had never seen them before . " We are not angels , my poor Francis , " she said , and then with an unconscious glance at the photograph of Persis on the desk ,  --  most of us.  --  " We are monsters , " he said filled with self-loathing , above all loathing of his body which at one time he had brought as if it 233were an offering , with all its powers and glories , to Notre Dame . And then , putting his head in his hands , he said , " Oh , Solange , if we could only be more human , if we only could  --  " It 's easier perhaps to be an angel , " she said gently . " What is difficult is to be this curious mixture of fire and earth and air and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said looking at her with a look so humblethat she lowered her eyes before it , " but I ca n't be . I 'm just torn in pieces , " he said getting up quickly because he felt he would begin to cry if he stayed there a moment longer and that was impossible . Suddenly the door which had been locked inside her opened . She got up and went to him , took his two hands in hers and said simply , " I 'm with you , Francis . You 're not alone in this . I 'm torn in pieces , too  --  every day ... " For a moment they stood , resting in each other 's arms , holdingeach other 's solid human weight as if it were the lightest burden in the world and not the heaviest . And then it was finished . " You 'll be all right , Francis . We both shall . Only it will take time . It 's true that it has been a long journey . " p 234ALL THROUGH this extraordinary summer Francis had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality one might call it , which he was quite incapable as yet of living . So what was bearable when he had stood close to Solange in those few seconds of real communion become quite unbearable when he got back to his room alone and faced the fact that that moment of arrival had also been the moment of final parting as far as their love was concerned . There would be no going back ever again . The flash of misery burned through him and it was a welcomeinterruption to be called to the phone by Fontanes . " It 's such a fine day , let 's get out of Paris into the country . " He had been to Brussels to give a lecture and was just back , it seemed . When Francis walked into the tiny crowded office , where he had never been , Fontanes was talking on the phone , so he had a chance to look around . It was an amazing little cubbyholeup a steep flight of steps at the back of a small courtyard and it was filled to bursting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one desk , letters and tele-p 235grams were all mixed up with drawings and lithographs ; on another , piles of plays , with notes sticking out of them , autographedbooks , and everywhere cracked boxes of notes and files , often hanging open with all their orderly confusion visible  --  orderly because Fontanes always seemed to be able to lay his hand on anything he had to find . " But , old man , it 's simply not possible . You must believe me  --  no . . . no . . . " Francis felt Fontanes weakening in his decision , for it was obviously more impossible for him to say no than to do the impossible thing he was being asked . " Oh , very well . You can count on me , but it 's a terrible bore and I 'm furious , goodbye , " he said angrily . " There , I 'm ready . " But before they actually left , Fontanes had called a hospital to see how an old friend was getting on who had been operated on that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aires , Boston and London , and scribbled a note to someone in Paris , and stuffed a batch of mail into his pockets to read later . " It 's time we got away , " he said when they were safely in the car , " I could see that I was going to get caught , cornered and then I should have been in for it . Oh my dear , forgive me , there is one thing I must still do . Stop at a florist . No , not that one , he collaborated  --  further on  --  there  --  " and Fontanes extricated his huge body from the little car with a groan , and disappeared into the florist where Francis watched him choosing flowers with the absolute concentration he gave to everything , shaking his head at the carnations , sniffing the roses with his enormous nose , and finally pointing in triumph to a bunch of pale blue larkspur , all the time keeping up a running commentary so the girl in the shop was convulsed with laughter when he left. p 236 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that . It 's the wife of one of my actors  --  she 's terribly depressed . Of course her husband is a cad , but that is not my fault , " he said angrily . " Your mornings must be rather like God 's , " Francis teased . " Can you really afford to go away even for an hour ? Wo n't the whole world collapse ? " Fontanes laughed and then looked suddenly mournful as he took out a cigar and puffed at it for a moment in silence . " There is too much suffering in the world , Francis . At times it becomes a shade unbearable . Then one must send flowers and telegrams and letters  --  I really send them all to myself , you know , to encouragemyself . That 's the truth , " he said as if he were rather surprised and had just discovered it . " I do n't doubt it . " " Listen , old man , you do n't have to drive like a lunatic just because everyone else in Paris does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic as they crossed the Place de la Concorde , but now he slowed down with a grin . " That 's better . Remember you have a very old frail passenger with you this morning , who may die at any moment , of fright . That would be embarrassing to say the least . And now , " said Fontanes with his usual absence of transition from the light to the serious , " what is all this with Solange ? You look like a ghost . She is cross and impossible on the phone . Nobody tells me anythingand I am enormously curious , " he said settling back to puff his cigar as if he expected the truth and nothing less than the truth to be laid before him like a pack of cards . " Nobody tells you anything because it 's none of your business , " Francis said shortly. p 237 " Ah ! I see  --  " Fontanes was silent for some minutes . " By the way , where are we going ? " " I thought to Rambouillet  --  maybe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , delighted to change the subject . " What a lovely day ! " " I am not devoting my morning to weather reports , " Fontanessaid firmly . " How long has this been going on ? " " Well , we 've had three good days , I think , " Francis answered wickedly . " How was the weather in Brussels ? " " Listen , my dear boy . I am seventy-three years old . My facultiesare unimpaired and even if I were blind and deaf I could have seen that you and Solange were having a love affair . So do n't be a fool and tell me why in heaven 's name you chose her out of all the women in the world ? You were bound to make each other unhappy . It was a frightful mistake and I am very cross with you both . At least Solange should have had more sense . " This was not the fake anger which Fontanes put on like a clown 's dress when he was feeling happy . Francis sensed that he was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I doubt , you should know better than to ask such questions , " Francis said unwilling to be serious as long as possible . He was afraid of Fontanes . " I do n't like it , " Fontanes said brusquely . " Why not ? " Francis challenged . " I expect you 'll learn a lot , " Fontanes granted a little grimly . " But all this romantic rubbish about suffering helping people , that 's what I dislike . Suffering withers and diminishes and destroys . Solange has had enough of it , too much . As for youp 238what you need is a little simple pleasure and joy . No , it 's all wrong , " Fontanes said as if he were giving a judgment in court . " We 're becoming a race of masochists and sadists  --  where is the joy gone ? " " It 's gone all right , " Francis conceded . " But as for Solange , do n't worry about that any more . It 's finished between me and Solange . " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently , putting a hand on Francis 's knee . " You see , Solange needs friends , we all need friends , " he said soberly . " Yes , " Francis said drily , " I suppose so . " " If you 'd seen her husband when he came back from the camps , you 'd know . She 's been through too much . That 's what I mean about suffering . It kills . You never saw the real Solange , she hides it so carefully . You saw someone you half invented , some marvelous creature of the imagination . She is very good at playing that game . But she knows , and that is why I do n't under-stand . " " You see I love her , " Francis said , " I love her too much . " " You do n't know what the word means , " Fontanes answered savagely . " You love yourself , because you are young . You love what you want for yourself . If you loved Solange you would have become her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty . " It 's better that I tell you the truth , Francis . And that is the truth . " " I know it is , " Francis said , frozen inside his face . " Very well , " said Fontanes inexorably , " then you must go away . You must find your joy , Francis  --  No , do n't be furious  --  I know that sounds cruel . Take all this with you and learn from it and use it . As long as you stay here , you will just worry it , worry yourself and Solange and make things worse . " p 239 " Have you talked to Solange ? " Francis said accusingly . " Of course not . Solange would never speak of such a thing to me . But I was there , you remember , the night when you first spoke of teaching , when you found your joy . And then I saw it go  --  Oh , that New England face of yours that thinks it can concealeverything and conceals nothing ! " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . " We never arrived anywhere . . . " he said helplessly . " Because there was nowhere for you to arrive , as you know very well , Francis . Did it ever occur to you that if Solange had really loved you , you would have broken her heart ? You 're at the beginning of your life , Francis  --  do n't you see ? " His tone now was all impatience , irritation , as if he were unaware of the implications in what he said , that " if Solange had ever loved you " that rang on in Francis 's mind . " You do n't know , " he said sharply , " you only guess . " " No , I do n't know , " Fontanes answered equally sharply , " but when I see two exceptional people , suffering uselessly , stupidly and making each other suffer , it enrages me . " He puffed violently at his cigar and threw it out of the window . " Evidently . " " There 's too much real suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this is n't real ? " Francis accelerated up to 70 out of sheer rage . " Real the way poetry is , the way music is , perhaps , on thatlevel of your imagination , yes , I 'm sure it is real enough . Butit is n't your real life , Francis , that 's what I mean . Any more thanit is Solange 's  --  you must admit that . . . " he almost implored . " You talk as if all this were something one decided rationally , p 241ready  --  what peace ! That 's what we all need , peace , sanity , everydaythings  --  " he said with the conviction of one who obviously has never fished and never had any peace . " I 'll never have any of that , " Francis said bitterly . " Nonsense ! You 'll marry and have five children . You 'll becomefearfully domestic and drive around Europe in a huge open car forcing your children to absorb culture . Your passion will be your vegetable garden , " and Fontanes leaned back his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defiance . " All right , " Francis laughed too , it was so incongruous , and yet somewhere inside him he recognized that scene . He knew that he wanted a home , children , a wife , long peaceful years . He knew but he would n't admit it . " It 's all very well for you to talk , but what about you ? That is n't the way you 've lived , is it ? " Suddenly Fontanes was serious . He laid a hand gently on Francis ' knee . " You see , I could n't , my dear . My wife died when we had been married just five years . When I was your age it was all finished for me . There could n't be anyone else . " And then his abnormal sensitivity told him that in some way this purity seemed to Francis like an attack and Fontanes went on , " So I had to make a passion of friendship , had to become a great meddler in other people 's affairs , a clown , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to be different for you , Francis . It 's all very well , this sort of life  --  and mind you , the theatre is a wife for me , in a way  --  but one gets lonely , " he admitted . " It 's better not to grow old alone . " " Solange , " Francis murmured , his eyes suddenly full of tears . " No , it 's not going to be easy for her either . And later , much later , she 'll need you Francis . She 'll need you as a friend . Don'tp 242forget that in these difficult days , maybe years . In the end , if you really care , if you really love , it wo n't be wasted , believe me . " They had reached the forest and Francis turned in to a dirt road , glad to go more slowly , to breathe in the green fragrance , to be among the healing old trees again . He was silent , having much to think about . Much later he said humbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love might be . " But now they were all enclosed in the green perspectives , they did not talk any more . Fontanes walked ahead , pointing out things that interested him with his stick , a fungus on the end of a fallen trunk , the brilliant green of the moss , and in a small glade a host of foxglove . And Francis followed , listening and accepting it all like a child . If he had come to Europe partly in search of his father , it seemed now that he had found him , the father a real father is too shy ever to be. p 243NOTHING WAS FINISHED ; nothing was easier than it had been . The hot summer days opened one after another like heavyheadedroses too heavy for their stems , but Alan out of the wisdom of his heart arranged the days as a prince ruling a small country might arrange them , hired a big car , carried them off to Amiens to see the cathedral , took them to the ballet and the few plays still on , and himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation , always delicate and subtle , infected them all . And in this atmosphere of summer pleasure , of friendship , of laughter and picnics and late evening suppers , Solange and Francis saw each other more peacefully , as if some sharpness of anguish and anxiety were smoothed down . For Alan 's sake they were gay and they discovered that a gaiety which at first had been put on like a mask became a real gaiety . To Francis it seemed like a difficult but entrancing dance and that if he ever stopped dancinghis heart would break , but as long as he could follow the intricate steps , he was curiously happy , catching Solange 's eye now and then , exchanging a smile , lying awake at night remembering , remembering  --  nothing was finished . But the great linesp 244were drawn . There was no going back now . And he knew that in these short months he had really come into his own and this was a last coming of age party , after which he would put away his dancingslippers and begin his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by so fast , it was frightening . He had been offered a temporary job in a small college in Iowa and had accepted it . He would go back with Alan and spend a month getting ready . All this was decided . There was nothing more to do now but make his farewells to every tree and every bridge , to the river and to Notre Dame , to the cafes where he had sat alone or with Solange or with Saul , to the beautiful soft light in the late evenings when the whole city seemed bathed in radiance , to the moon and the stars which would never look the same again , to Solange , to Solange , to Solange . Francis was enclosed in a brilliant solitariness , wearing a golden armor of resolution . Long before the last day , the last night came , he had gone . The actual parting was strangely formal , the final step in the dance when the partners curtsey and bow and the lights are turned off . It was Solange , left alone in her salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fontanes had insisted on going to the airport with Saul to see them off ) , who sat with her hands abandoned in her lap and wept while the . petals of the roses Francis had brought the day before fell one by one , each with a soft heavy plop , as if they too knew that summer was gone forever . But by the time Fontanes came back , she was hard at work . " My poor friend , you look exhausted . Eugenie will make us a cup of coffee , " she said briskly , hoping that by now herp 245face showed no sign of those tears she had wept so selfishly for herself . " I 'm too old , " he said with a grimace , sitting down heavily . " It 's hard to say good-bye when one is old . " And then , as he took out a cigar and cut off the end with a brusque gesture , " I love that boy . He 's human , more human than we are with our hard old hearts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontanes , really ? " " I embarrassed him by weeping at the airport , " Fontaneschuckled . " To a New Englander , you know , it must have seemedquite mad . Oh dear , " and he chuckled again , " silly old fool . " " They 'll come back , Fontanes . The new world will comeback to the old  --  the old nurse  --  " she said ironically . " I wish I could live to be a hundred , " Fontanes said dreamily , " to see  --  " " The Americans grow up ? " But Fontanes was hardly listening to what she said . " What a dear kind man that Alan Bradford is , " he said puffing at his cigar . But Solange did n't answer . At the moment it seemed to her quite unbearable that life must so often take so much away from those with the greatest gifts , Alan whom Persis had never loved as he needed to be loved , Francis  --  how little we are able to give each other for all we feel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got up and went out to tell Eugenie to bring coffee in at once. p 249FRANCIS SANK almost at once into an apathy of waiting . His head ached . The roar of the motors made conversation impossibleand the plane journey , instead of seeming shorter than the way over on the boat , became with every hour interminably long . He slept fitfully , dreaming crowded tiring dreams in which all the images of the last months got mixed up and could n't be sorted out . Once he turned to Alan , reading a French novel beside him , and shouted , " Department of utter confusion . " At dawn they saw the sunrise over a thick bank of clouds and had breakfast somewhere or other on the ground ; places approached by plane have no reality . They are just suddenly there , and as suddenly not there . It appeared that in two hours they would be landing . Alan treated him kindly as one treats an invalid and did n't try to talk . And Francis was grateful not to be alone just yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great stillness , lie down on the bed in his room and begin to feel . Begin to suffer . For the time being he was grateful to do neither , just to be a body transportedwith unnatural speed from one world to another . Andp 250in the air , in the huge throbbing monster , no world was tangible . He did not have to think or try to make an adjustment . He would just be planted down in two hours in the middle of  --  what ? What would it be  --  America ? Boston ? His job ? Himself ? Ann ? He turned away from her name as if it made him feel rather ill even to imagine Ann just now . The last few moments were taken up with fastening the landingbelt and swallowing to keep his ears from hurting . Suddenly a great round piece of earth swung dizzily into view , houses and a flash of river tilted up at them dangerously , then flowed away , as the plane straightened out to circle the field and come in . Francis resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrously inappropriate to be thrown down like this into the middle of life again , unprepared , slightly sick-feeling , his bones tired , his head muzzy . I ca n't do it , he thought , as if his will had any power here . It 's quite impossible . But just then they hit the land with a terrific hard bump . The hideous low lands around the airport flowed past and they taxied in . Before there was time to appreciate the stillness and relief from vibration , they had to struggle to their feet and get out . " Of course , " Francis said , pushing into a wall of solid heat as he reached the door , " it 's August . " " August with a vengeance . " Alan was panting slightly when they were finally through the Customs and sitting in the taxi . Now the hot damp air , filled with dust , blew in but did not dry the film of sweat on their faces . Francis looked out and could n't believe that there could be such ugliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutters , filth everywhere and the smell of train smoke . Had it always been like this ? " Has this been going on long ? " Alan asked the driver and p 251Francis smiled at the double meaning that question had for him . " Ai n't you seen the papers ? We 've beat the record . Two straight weeks never below ninety . It 's crazy . . . " They gulped down the hot stale wind in the tunnel and then began to thread their way through the narrow streets of downtownBoston . No sky now . Just buildings , heavy hot stone walls holding the heat in like the walls of an oven . The driver 's shirt clung to his back . Even the elms on Beacon Hill looked wilted , shriveled brown here and there , and more like feather dusters than ever . The house stood in full sun , hurting their eyes as they looked up at the blind windows . Heat bounced off the facade and hit them like a blow . Inside it smelled stale . Alan and Francis separated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis thought , Eventually I shall be here . I 'm not yet , so I do n't know what it will be like . Later they sat in Alan 's study , having torn dust-covers off the chairs and made a human island here , bringing up ice from the kitchen to drink tall glasses of iced water . It was too hot for a real drink . Francis had on some dungarees and no shirt or shoes . There was a smell of old tobacco and dust everywhere . It was clearly a house in which no woman had lived for a long time , stale and desolate . " We 'll have to get out of here , " Alan said . " The maids wo n't be back for another week . Mother expects me at Mt . Desert as a matter of fact . What are you thinking of doing ? " " I'Il be all right , " Francis said without conviction . " I 'll go to the movies , " he added bitterly , " read Life and Time , eat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , the car . That meantp 252one sort of escape , escape from the house . He could drive off , find a beach and go for a swim . Some one of the people battling inside him could do this . Another might write a letter . " There 's the job , " Alan said , " I expect you 'll have to do some work at Widener  --  that should be cool anyway . " " Yes , " Francis said , " do you suppose there 's a map around ? I 'd like to find out where I 'm going . " But neither of them moved . They felt stranded . The house might have been a desert island . " I do n't suppose anyone 's in town , " Alan said meditatively ; he meant Ann . " Nope , guess not . " " Maybe that 's just as well . It 'll take you a while , you know , to get adjusted . I 've only been away three weeks but I feel like Rip Van Winkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so ugly ? I think I had forgotten . " " I think I 'll go down and play some music , " Francis said . If there was a refuge here at all , it would be in the drawing room . " Come down when you feel like eating , Alan . We 'll go someplace cool . " The American language fitted him again like the dungarees . He tasted the words as if they were food and suddenly liked the taste . He stripped the dust-cover off his mother 's chair and sat down , reached mechanically to the box on the table beside him and by a miracle found an old package of Luckies there . Then he got up and put on a Mozart concerto , lay down on the cool floor and listened . He did n't listen well because his head was still whirling , but at least the music opened a door into a more constructive kind of thinking or feeling . This room of his mother 's was restful just because it did not suggest France or America , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ap 253way of life that included the two warring parts of Francis and made a synthesis . His eyes rested absent-mindedly on the shelves of paper-backed books . Montaigne , they read ; Pascal ; Bergson  --  this last brought him to his feet . But he sat down again , compelled by the music to be still and to listen . Later he could explore this library . Just because he was very tired and in a state of shock , he was extremely wide awake and aware , listening to more than Mozart , listening in the way a poet listens just before the poem begins to arrive , a lucid passivity that at any moment will turn into an intense kind of inward action . So now , carried along on the suave poignant music , Francis felt pieces of his life come into focus like the lines of a poem . He measured for the first time consciously the distance he had come since the day of his mother 's funeral , compared his revolt , his cold lost self of that time with the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense not of parting but of arrival that had carried him through their goodbyes . Work , for Francis , had been outside his real life , and now suddenly he realized that it would be the root of everything . His head was full of ideas  --  could he start his classes out with Montaigne ? Find some way of building up a course that would be an inward experience as well as the exploration of a language ? What a lot he would have to do before the middle of September ! The rage of learning which often possesses teachers , but rarely students , took hold of him . But still he lay on the floor and waited and listened while the intricate pattern wove itself in and out , that thread that time can not break . And Francis knew and was grateful that all this was happening to him here in this room not because of any strength in himself , but because at last , being free , he could accept all the human gifts. p 254What was held in this room was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , was his both to receive and to give . He felt a wild excitement when he thought of standing up before those twenty or thirty human faces , those boys and girls to whom , he now knew , he had everything to say , and from whom he also imagined he would have much to learn . While the last record played , Alan came in and sat down in Persis ' chair , very quietly . And when it was over , they stayed in the silence for some minutes until Francis , unable to contain himselfany longer , sprang to his feet and said , " Alan , it 's wildly exciting to be alive ! " " Well , well , " Alan said , looking with admiration at the glistening expression of Francis ' whole body as he stood and stretched and yawned . " You seem to have been rather busy down here . " " I do n't know , " Francis said . " It 's strange being back of course , but here in this room everything seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what she was  --  what I 've been thinking is these things have nothing to do with times or places , with countries , but they have to do with people . One can be a person anywhere , Alan , do n't you think ? " " It would seem fairly obvious , " Alan grinned . " Do n't laugh at me . I know I 'm just finding out what you 've always known . It 's true Boston looks terribly ugly and there 's enough to hate all around us to keep us in a fighting frame of mind , but the thing I 've been seeing , Alan , is that we can change it . You see , it 's ours  --  mine , perhaps I should say . I love this country the way you can only love something imperfect  --  well , I suppose the way people love their children . One is involved . Inp 255Europe I was at home , as I 'll never be here , but I was not in-volved . " " Not involved ? " Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  I suppose I was  --  but I was not responsible , that was it , was n't it , Alan ? " " Perhaps ... " " They all felt responsible for me , I think . But I could n't be responsible for them . I just took and took from them and had nothing to give . Here I have something to give . I have something to be which is all my own , which no one can take from me . The relief of it , Alan ! " And then , as if he were already responsible for Alan , Francis ' tone changed and he said , " Come on , I 'm inviting you to lunch at the Ritz . Boy , wo n't a glass of milk taste good ! " " A glass of milk at the Ritz ? " And they both laughed . But as they were going down the stairs , when Francis had changed , he said , " By God , Aunt Susan is not going to have this house . I want it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to come back here . " He had not even thought of Ann , yet. p 256BUT WHEN ALAN had left the next day to go to Mt . Desert and Francis was alone in the house , and knew that he must begin to work in earnest and not just have grand ideas about work , as the long hot day began , and he felt the reaction to the journey and his sleepless night , he did think of Ann . She was at Bar Harbor just a few miles from Alan and Alan would surely be seeing her . In her last letter she had said , " Come back , Francis . We are just the same , even if you are not . You must come up and have a swim before you leave for the job . I want to hear everything . " And much as he wanted to see her and to tell her , he knew she was the one person he could not tell . Only when he thought of Ann did some of his old atmosphere of conflict come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote to Saul , a long letter all about himself , full of the future , hardly mentioning the past . He brought in bottles of milk and cereal and settled in to work for the day . But work did not come easily , after all . There were so many questions  --  he knew so little what it would be like in the little college which he had found on the map . What if they had ap 259 " Teaching ? " Aunt Alison asked , unable to hide her amazement . " Yes , anything queer about it ? " Francis asked . " Sit down , dear , and drink some tea . I 'm quite exhausted by so many surprises in five minutes  --  " and she pushed her hair back with a tired gesture  --  " this heat . " " You should be in Maine , " Francis said . " Well , there 's a lot to do getting ready for our winter battles in the legislature  --  and with everyone else away I thought I 'd better stick around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Alison that Francis smiled . " I wish you 'd surprise me sometime by doing something outrageouslyselfish and luxurious . Do come and stay at the house , " Francis said , " I might even learn to cook if you did , or at least empty the ashtrays  --  it 's amazing how messy one lonely man can make a house in twenty-four hours . " " Are you sure it would n't be me who emptied the ashtrays ? " " Quite sure , " Francis said with his new masterful air , " I want you to come . For my sake , " he added cleverly , " if not for your own . It 's damned lonely . " And he caught her expression , looking at him , half amazed , half amused . He would have liked to hug her but it was too hot . " It 's wonderful of you to be here , " he said , stretching out his legs comfortably and sipping the cool drink . " Alan had to go to his mother 's , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? " Aunt Alison asked out of her contemplation of him . " Yes  --  no . . . " Francis hesitated , " I do n't know yet . Luckily , I have to work like a beaver to get this course ready in a month . " p 260 " And it 's what you want ? " she asked , " what you really want  --  this job ? Coming home ? " " Yes , " Francis said , without comment . " You 've grown up Francis . " She had reached her conclusion now . " In just two months or a little more . I never will understand about people , " she said humbly , " but I can see that that 's what has happened and I 'm awfully glad about the job . I think you 'll be a wonderful teacher ? " " Why ? " Francis asked to tease her . " Well , " Aunt Alison 's honest face looked troubled , " maybe because you do n't seem like one or a person who would wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ended , smiling , " and that 's a good thing . " And then she added , " They 'll tease you about your Boston accent , you know  --  out there . " " I expect so . That wo n't matter if I can get them interested in the subject , get them mad and thinking  --  even if they hate me , it wo n't matter , " he said thoughtfully . " The trouble with my education , " he went on , " is that I never got really bitten by anything . It was all on the surface . And the trouble in Paris was , you see , that I got so filled up with things , all sorts of things , and there was no way to use it all . I suppose I 'll have to go back now and then just to get filled up again , but I know now that it 's here I have to live and work . I used to be awfully pretentious , do n't you think , Aunt Alison ? About being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a jumble . " Perhaps , a little . " " Go ahead , I can take it . " But before she could go on , he said , " I 'm glad I am , though . Unadulterated Boston  --  forgive me , Aunt Alison  --  might be too much of a good thing . " Then they both laughed. p 261 " And yet , " Francis said thoughtfully , " I suppose one is never really at home except where one 's anger lies . I never got angry in France , with the French , the way I get angry here  --  the way they get angry . " He was thinking of Fontanes . " What about Saul ? " Aunt Alison asked . " Oh Saul 's staying over . He can do his work there  --  he 's burrowed his way into the Bibliotheque Nationale and I expect he 'll be there for years and years . Saul 's a real student . It does n't matter where he is  --  though I think he 'll always be happier over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I can . He had to break away so completely from his family , from his background . He can make his roots anywhere now . " " I thought that 's what you wanted to do . . . " She could n't get used to this new Francis . He surprised her every minute . " I ? " Francis laughed , " I was really looking for my family . I was just the opposite . " " And did you find it ? " " I found a father , " Francis said quietly , " I guess that 's what I needed most . " " Ann will be awfully glad to hear all this , " Aunt Alison said without thinking . " What has Ann got to do with it ? " Suddenly Francis was on edge again . His sense of mastery quite gone . Why did everyone always bring Ann up ? But of course he knew very well why . " Oh , never mind , " he said getting up . " I suppose I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my fond farewells to Mrs. Bradford and all the tribe . " " It might be a good idea , " Aunt Alison said quietly . " Damn it , " Francis said , " nothing 's ever all settled , is it ? You get one thing settled and then another pops up before you catchp 262your breath . I ran away from Paris , " he said half defiantly . " I had to . " " Yes , so I gathered . You know , I did n't really think you 'd grown up in two months just by going to the Louvre . " " Is it written all over me ? " Francis asked half laughing , " as if I had had the smallpox ? " " It must have been hard to leave , " she said gently . " It would have been harder to stay . " " Yes , I suppose so , " said Aunt Alison as if she knew all about it . It was faintly disconcerting to be so well understood having explained nothing . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told me she hoped to God you were having a love affair in Paris . " There was some malice in the statement which Alison did n't bother to conceal . " She did ? " Francis sat down again . " Whatever made her say that ? " Alison was suddenly impatient . " You 've grown up , Francis , but you still have a lot to learn . " " Yes , Aunt Alison , " Francis said like a small boy who answers what is expected of him , but understands not at all . And with that they began to make plans about moving Aunt Alison over to the house . She would go back to her apartment and work every morning , she said . It was impossible for Alison to say how sweet , how unexpected this fellowship with her nephew was . And Francis , with a surplus of love and energy , enjoyed himself taking care of her , even brought her breakfast up one morning , but Aunt Alison could n't change her habits of austerity in a night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen , messing about with the cooking and laughing at how often the steak burned or the water boiled over because neitherp 263of them could manage to pay attention at the right time . Francis got the car out and once they took a picnic to the Ipswich beach and lay on the sand all afternoon . Fontanes ' letters began to come , every three or four days , short notes in which exclamation points and dashes conveyed his concern . He was sending over piles of books , he said . He said that Solange had gone away to Brittany for a month ; that he had dinner with Saul who looked tired and was working much too hard ( " Oh , you Americans ! Why are you so pursued by time ? You have time and do n't even know it . " ) And always these letters ended , half-laughing , half-serious with references to the job Francis had on his hands . " Do n't forget to civilize the barbarians , young barbarian . " After a week or so they were answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a snort , needling him , pouring faith into him , asking the best of him . And Francis worked as he had never worked before , found himselfsweating with excitement , was amazed at how many ideas he had about education , just from having been more or less educatedhimself . He was determined to plant the class down in front of something and make them dig to get it . He was never never going to deliver a lecture . And often in the middle of a sentence he would pause and lift his head , wondering what " they " would be like , his first class . " You 're going to expect too much , " Aunt Alison said when he talked about his plans , " but there 's no harm in that , as long as you do n't give in . " Francis looked up then with a vivid smile , " I shall enjoy the fight , " he said , " that 's why I came home . " It was above all a time of beginnings , of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when usually life is as still as a still p 264pond , a time when both Francis and his aunt were preparing themselves for battle . But there was a faint suspense in the air , too , because they both knew that eventually he would have to go to Maine and face the family and Ann . Aunt Alison tactfully refrainedfrom mentioning Ann . Instead she got Francis to talk about Solange , to tell her all he could . Perhaps there was a judgment in the clear gray eyes that listened so well but if so , Aunt Alison never spoke it aloud . When one loves people wholly as she loved Francis it is hard to accept that they must be hurt to grow . And without even being aware of it , he pleaded his side of the affair . She could not guess how violent and difficult , how demanding he had become in those few short weeks of his passion . But in his heart , Francis knew it , and constantly pushed to the back of his consciousness the sense of failure . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected it , though he wrote a dozen letters a week and tore them up . In the end he knew there was nothing to say to her yet . He would only be able to write to her when he was free , when he could accept the summer as past . Meanwhile the very continuity of his feeling pushed him on into his work , kept him going at an accelerated pace . He slept badly on those hot nights . Sometimes Alison heard him creep down the stairs after midnight and go out to walk along the river , so she guessed . He alwayscame back within an hour , though at first she had been anxious . And the next morning he was wide awake at seven and ready to make the breakfast while she was still trying to pull herself up into another of the heavy still days . " I 'm about ready to stop , " he said after two weeks . " I think I 'll make a break and-go to Maine tomorrow . " p 265 " Would you like me to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approach . " No , " Francis grinned , " you see too damn much , Aunt Alison . I 'm afraid I 'll be self-conscious enough as it is . " To celebrate the last night , he took her to the movies . Now it seemed to them both that these two weeks of peaceful companionshiphad gone by too fast . It was the end of something . And Francis , as he waved good-bye , thought that Aunt Alison looked very frail and old suddenly . He hated to leave her . But when he was out of the Boston traffic and on the post road , he felt elated at being alone in the car , able to drive fast . Everything on the familiar road looked new and splendid  --  the roadstands piled with squashes and pumpkins and bottles of cider , the red of the scrubby sumac trees , and the occasional flash of crimson or gold in the maples , even the salt marshes looked like a strange country which he had never seen before , and of which he was taking possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , as a white farm with two elms in front of it came into view and then vanished . It 's nothing much really. p 266SHE WENT NORTH the temperature dropped . Next morningafter spending a night in a tourist camp , Francis put on a sweater . The change in temperature was such a relief that he felt like a released balloon , ate an enormous breakfast and breathed in the smell of salt air and pine with extravagant pleasure . Forever and ever summer had meant rocks and icy dark blue ocean , pine trees , blueberry bushes hot in the sun , the feel of heavy oars in the palm of his . hands , or a tennis racquet . And Ann . Here whatever the winter had been , they always met , inventedtheir own games , were tree-people or Indians , later were kept busy making plans to " escape " the others , to go off with a Shaw play to read and discuss , and some hard-boiled eggs and bread and butter in a paper bag . They had various secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually took them so long to find the place that they never seemed to have much time when they got there . They were bitten by mosquitos , or there was a cold fog and they shivered . Why then were these all happy memories , the only really happy ones of his childhood ? On the wave of all this , without stopping to think , Francisp 267drove up the winding hill road through scrubby trees to Ann 's house , an old-fashioned white house surrounded by screened-in porches , where the work of " cutting a view " was never ending  --  and this was one of the tasks Ann and Francis ran away to escape . When the car stopped with a screech on the gravel , Francis could hear the familiar sound of someone chopping just below him . In a second he was crashing down through the leaves , calling , " Ann ! " " Francis ! Listen darling , for heaven 's sake help me get this horrible tree down . Then we can talk . But father insists that it 's this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mind ? " She was so absorbed in the work that she had hardly stopped to look at him . Tall , brown , her fair hair cut short for the summer , she looked wonderfully well , Francis thought , as he silently took the ax from her . " It 's rather mean , poor Francis , when you 're just back , " she said standing off , a little breathless , while Francis went to work . " I forgot about ax-handles , " he said . " Just now I was remembering the feel of oars and a tennis racquet . But I 'd forgotten axhandles . " For some reason it amused him very much . He laughed aloud , swinging the ax too far and almost dropping it . " Hey , look out ! " " All right , I 'll concentrate . " How well she remembered that fierce look he had when he was trying to do something he found difficult . Francis always went at everything with too much energy and too little skill . But after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a very big tree and after ten minutes of whackingat it , it suddenly toppled over , so much lighter than one expected , and crashed through the trees. p 268Francis sat down rubbing the palm of his hand . Ann , leaning against a tree , lit a cigarette . " It smells good here , " he said , leaning back on his elbows . " I 'd forgotten how good it smells . " Now that he was here , so simply here , they both took the fact for granted . They were enclosed in the familiar green world , the smell of dead leaves and mushrooms , the damp woodsy smell . The past flowed through the present like a peaceable river . Ann slipped down beside him . " I never thought you 'd come back , " she said quietly . " I thought France would be it . " " What ? " Francis turned to face her clear wide-open eyes , blue as the sea hidden by the trees , unwavering before his quick shy glance . For now it was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever it is you 've always been looking for . I suppose , a person , " she said matter-of-factly . " It was too queer going on and on never falling in love , you know . " " It was stupid of me , " he said . He felt ruffled and disarmed , a little on the defensive . He was annoyed with Ann for being so calm . At the same time he realized that it was a great relief to be talking to someone who looked on him as an equal , not from some great height , or across an abyss of time and experience , but straight from where she stood and he stood in life . The absence of tension was so vivid that he felt almost shaken by it . And after a moment , he lay down flat on his back , his arms under his head , looking at the sky through the irregular patterns of the leaves . He looked at them very differently from the way he had looked at the leaves in Paris , for here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst open and speak , but everything was just itself , as hep 269remembered it , in the fullness of time . On a fallen log not very far from his head a large frilled orange fungus stood out . " I learned a lot in Paris , about myself , I mean , " he said out of the silence which had been neither long nor short , but like the rocks and leaves , its necessary self . " So much happened in such a short time , Ann , I was almost too alive to live . It became nothing but pain , failure . . . " he hesitated . " And revelation ? " she asked gravely . " In a way , yes . Yes , it surely was that . How did you know ? " He sat up to face her again , to try to read her face , herself , she who seemed to him now to have become so transparent that she was hardly there , so honest that she was a little more than human . Ann laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what Alan has told me . " " You can believe anything Alan says , " Francis said , without a shade of irritation . " How you 've changed ! " " Have I ? " " A year ago you would have been furious at anyone saying anything about you . You would have made a scene . " She laughed . " I rather enjoyed your scenes , did you ? " " I expect I did , " Francis laughed too , and then winced , rememberinghow he had battered against Solange 's walls in vain . " I 'm sorry it was such hell , Francis . It should have been happy  --  perhaps not happy , exactly , but gay and delicate and warm like Mozart . " She stopped as if she had gone too far . " No , it was not like that . Solange  --  " he stopped , unable to go on . Here was the abyss . Here was the moment he had dreaded all the last weeks , the real crisis . He could n't go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , " he forced himself to say , as if hep 270were by some immense effort pulling himself up out of a whirlpool . " You used always to blame other people for things that went wrong , do you remember , Francis ? " Ann said gently . " Did I ? " he was startled . " You were never quite honest . " " I 'm not honest now , " he said harshly . " I 've never known anyone who was except you . " " It 's a dangerous trait . It scares most people . " He was surprised by the sadness in her voice . " Let 's go down to the sea , " Francis said . " I have n't really seen it yet . " He got up , restlessly , and lit a cigarette . Things were happening to him which he had not foreseen , which he was in no sense ready for , which horrified him . He felt as if he had no shell at all . Everything here touched him too closely . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he realized now that it was a different part of the river , or that in some curious way the past itself had changed because of what had happened to him in France . The emphasis had shifted . It was true that there was peace in it , but peace meant something different now . What he had taken for granted had suddenly become infinitelydesirable , and at the same time impossible . Solange who had opened the door for him into his real life , now stood between him and it . The fact of his feeling for her , of her existence , of Ann 's knowledge of both , was there , would be there always . He led the way , running down through the wood , as if he were running away from Ann . They were both breathless when they came out onto the road . Here they could walk side by side . " Alan was afraid that America would seem ugly , too ugly to bear  --  I must say the drive in from the airport was pretty grim ; p 271and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gropingfor a transition from the private world where they had been , to this public road where they walked side by side , " but all the way down here I kept looking and looking at everything . It 's not beautiful exactly , but it 's home , Ann . You do n't know what a relief it is to have finally proved that to myself . It makes all the difference . I think it 's because I know what I can do here , now . Always before I 've been outside looking on and I think I pretended to be French just to evade the real issue . " " But you are partly French . It 's true that you are , " Ann protested . " That 's not an evasion . " " Everyone American is something else too . That 's part of being American . The difference is that most people bury that other part and I want to keep it alive , but keep it alive by using it over here . Oh Ann , how beautifully right it all seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hour of elation in Boston had come back to him . " All right , but do n't run . I ca n't keep up with you , " Ann said cheerfully . " Of course everyone imagined you would do something brilliant and extraordinary , you know Francis  --  I think they 're a bit miffed that you 've turned out to be so normal . " She was smiling mischievously at him . " And unimportant ? " he asked with a shade of contempt in his voice . " Maybe . " " They 're another generation , Ann . I 've been thinking a great deal about all this . They went out for being stars , you know . One had to do something big in the world . And then it was still possible . We want something different , something simpler . I think that 's a good thing . Maybe it 's the beginning of being civilized , p 272Lots of bright boys are leaving New York to go and live in the country and bring up families . The values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , you know . She knew that livingwas the important thing , living and being useful . She wanted people to be themselves . " " And Solange ? " Ann asked , deliberately taking the leap and this time for her own sake , not for his . " Solange wanted that too , Ann , " Francis said gravely . " She made it possible for all this to happen , for me to come out into what I can be , but she always knew that she was doing it not for herself , and I did n't know it . I had to try to keep breaking her down , because I was so in love , because I was so much younger , because . . . " he hesitated , and then went on in a low voice , " passion like that shuts everything but itself out . It has to end badly , painfully . She knew that . She said at the very end , It 's been a long journey , ' and she meant  --  I see it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , for both of us . " Ann was silent . " It leaves you kind of out on a limb , " she said just as they turned off to the rocks , to the sea . " Yes , " Francis said honestly , " it does . " Ann climbed down to the rocks , swiftly on her sure dancing feet and stood very close to the water , her back to him . The wind blew her dress back . Francis did not look at the sea . He looked at her , until he could not see her any more through the inexplicablesavage tears. p 273THAT EVENING the whole family gathered on Mrs. Bradford 's porch for cocktails to welcome Francis home . He was glad to see them all together , to get it all over , so to speak , at one go . This was very different from Ann 's casual , simple taking him for granted , putting him to work chopping down a tree . This was running the gauntlet of all their conjectures about him , having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who might have been going off forever , back again before the summer was even over . He might , indeed , never have been away . Francis , conscious of what he had to meet , had dressed for the occasion , had put on as much protective coloring as possible . He had on immaculate white flannels , a shirt and tie , and a blazer he unearthed over at Aunt Sukey 's . The cupboard in his bedroom was full of old sneakers , dungarees  --  and , by good luck , this dark blue blazer left over from the summer before , as well as his tennis racquet which he was very glad to find . He had hardly seen the Thorndikes who came in from a sail while he was dressing , and he slipped out to walk over to Mrs. Bradford 's , calling out to the house in general , " See you later . " So now at ap 274little after six he walked up the path alone so silently on his rubber-soled shoes that they did not see him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , had taken them in as completely as the eye of a camera taking a snapshot in the few seconds of his approach . Aunt Sukey was sitting on the porch steps in a low-cut white cotton dress that exhibited her bronzed arms and shoulders to great effect . Her head was thrown back and she was laughing at something her husband had just said as he leaned over with the big silver shaker to pour her cocktail . John Thorndike was standing against the pillar opposite her and Alan and his mother sat in two wicker armchairs near the edge of the porch . For some reason ' the group made Francis think of family portraits he had seen of the early days of photography . They were carefully posed to look casual , a summer picture . " You look very charming , all of you , " Francis said , amused at their not having noticed him , amused at their startled and selfconsciousbreaking up of the picture , as if they almost resented his taking them like this , by surprise . " Heavens , Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I saw him , " said Mrs. Bradford , " but I did n't wish to spoil the picture . You were taking our picture , were n't you , Fran-cis ? " " Yes , I was , how did you guess ? " " Because you had the photographer 's expression , as if people were objects . I 'm glad you find us charming , " she said lifting her chin with a slightly defiant air . " It was a family portrait , only I miss Aunt Alison , " Francis said and then shook hands with his Uncle Samuel , with John and Alan , reaching Mrs. Bradford last . He kissed her on onep 275cheek and then , forgetting where he was , stooped to kiss the other and bumped into her head . " I was giving you a French kiss , by mistake , " he said and laughed with genuine amusement . " Please forgive me . " " How charmingly effusive of you , Francis , " Mrs. Bradford said rubbing her forehead where he had bumped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still amused and did not hide it . Then , as he accepted a cocktail gratefully from his uncle , Francis turned to Sukey , sat down one step below her and said , " Aunt Sukey has more chic than any woman I saw in Paris . " " Goodness , " Aunt Sukey said , but she was awfully pleased , " how Paris must have deteriorated since the war . " " That was one thing the photographer thought , " he said . " What else did he think ? " John asked , rather glumly . " We 're a dull lot , as a matter of fact . " " Good photographers keep their thoughts to themselves , " Alan said quietly . Francis , feeling the alliance strong between him and Alan , glanced up and almost winked . " You held the pose beautifully , but what I was really thinking , " Francis said , amazed that it could be the truth , " was that I am awfully glad to be home . " " Hear , hear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Paris , " Aunt Sukey commanded , " and stop being polite . Was it all you thought it would be ? " " Yes , " Francis said , without comment , " it was . " " And yet you 're glad to be home  --  well , that 's very nice of you , Francis , " Mrs. Bradford conceded . " I ca n't say as much for Alan . He 's pining already to get away , are n't you , Alan ? " She turned her icy blue gaze on her son and waited for the arrow to land. p 276 " It takes a while to settle down again , " he said amiably and evasively . " But I expect I shall . " " Francis seems very settled , " Mrs. Bradford said . " He 's only passing through on his way to the West , after all , " John said . " He knows he can get away . " " It 's only for a year , you know , " Francis said , " I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " he said vaguely . " Yes , " Sukey broke in eagerly , " there 's the house . What about the house , Francis ? Something will have to be decided . I do n't expect Alan wants to keep it on alone . " " I want him to stay if he wants to . I think I shall be living there myself . The continuity seems a good idea , " he explained a little stiffly , " I mean , if I can , I 'd like to carry on where my mother left off . " " You have changed , " Aunt Sukey said , lifting her eyebrows . " I thought you could n't wait to shake the dust of Boston from your feet . You 're not going to turn into a proper Bostonian , after all , Francis  --  what a disillusion ! " Francis laughed . " I might try to be one . I fear I should n't succeed . " " I want to know about Paris , " Uncle Samuel said . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few minutes . " Did you go to any night clubs ? Is it still gay Paree ? " " I guess so , " Francis answered kindly , " I did n't see much of that Paris . I spent an awful lot of time just reading and wandering around looking at things . It seemed enough just to be there , really . " He wanted to tell them , but he was n't sure they were interested . Samuel poured more drinks and for a while the conversationdrifted and they relaxed . Francis looked out at the sea , dark blue now as the light went , with a clear light band at the 277horizon . He felt detached and at the same time part of everything . He took them all for granted now . He did not have to fight them any longer . It gave him a feeling of peaceful power . John and he planned a game of tennis for the next morning . There would be a picnic on the rocks over at Aunt Sukey 's . The murmur of voices rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay too much attention . There were so many summer evenings held in this one evening ; it seemed a distillation of them all . Of course Mrs. Bradford eventually broke the peace by asking , " You 've seen Ann , I suppose ? " " Yes , I spent the morning chopping trees over there , " Francissaid as casually as possible . But his heart gave a queer leap like a fish who feels the line . " Ann was convinced that you would never come back , " Aunt Sukey said , looking at Francis with a special attentiveness . But it was not an unkind look . It seemed that for this evening they too had laid down their arms and were glad to have him home , to be together in this place of good memories . " Well , " Francis rubbed his forehead , " I did n't know myself . I had to find out a lot of things . But I did n't see how I could be useful in France , really live there . I would always have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really a European , you know : " He smiled a slightly disdainful smile . " I did n't have anything to offer them , you see . " " And you feel then that you have a lot to offer us ? " Mrs. Bradford asked sweetly . Francis flushed and felt something of the old anger rise in him for the first time . " You know what I mean , " he turned to Alan . " It sounds arrogant , Mrs. Bradford , but I think what I have here is being still close to France . Civilization  --  or what Ip 278mean by civilization  --  still flows that way , from Europe to us . Oh dear , " Francis said , bogging down . Now he had begun he found that he did n't know exactly what he meant . He felt baffled by their polite attention , their sceptical kind glances . " Just what do you mean by civilization , Francis ? " Alan asked . He was afraid now for Francis , afraid the bloom of his new faith and certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't want it to happen yet . " I knew you 'd ask that , " Francis flashed a smile at him . " You make me feel as if I were passing an exam . But I 'll try to answer , " he said thoughtfully , " because I want to know , myself . I suppose it 's something about certain human values being more important than knowledge or success or money or social position or any of the things we still believe in like fetishes , that it 's day-to-day living , what goes into each moment that counts , and how rich one 's capacity for experience is . Most of us Americans seem flat as if there were one dimension missing like primitive painting . It shows in our faces , flat faces , " he said bitterly . " I think we 're all scared to death of living , really . We 're always making up games so we wo n't have to do it . " It was amazing to be talking like this in the presence of Mrs. Bradford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a second , Francis regretted bitterly having given so much of himself away , so clumsily . It was nearly dark now and suddenly quite cold . " I expect you lived in Paris , all right , " John said with unexpectedenvy . It broke the spell and they all laughed . " We 'll have to go in , " Mrs. Bradford said getting up , " or I 'll have rheumatism tomorrow . You 're young , Francis . And you know a lot but you do n't know about rheumatism yet , " and top 279his surprise beckoned Francis to help her up . " There , " she said , leaning a hand rather heavily on his arm , " I think we 're rather proud of Francis , are n't we , Alan ? " " I think we are , " Alan said quietly . It was the first time in many months that he was able to feel fond of his mother . " So now let 's go in to dinner and drink his health . We 're having champagne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle West . " " I bet it 's a dry town , " Uncle Samuel said . " That would be a joke . " p 280IT WAS not quite like anything else in the world , Francis thought , this gathering of Sears and lobsters , of Thorndikes and clams , of Cabots and seaweed , of Endicotts and corn in the ear for the big yearly clambake on the rocks near the Thorndikes ' . The preparations were heroic and began early in the morning when he and John went down to a pebbly beach and struggled for hours in icy water to drag up bushels of slippery shining seaweed that tangled round their rubber boots , slid out of their arms and behaved as perversely as only inanimate objects can . Francis slipped and fell twice and was soaked to the skin , but he was enjoying himself hugely . John and he communicated by grunts and groans and occasional laughs and felt a great sense of triumph when they had loaded their plunder into the back of the station wagon . It was a perfect day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire welcome , just windy enough to dot the dark blue of the ocean with white frills of foam , but the sun was warm and there would be sheltered places on the rocks , where the frailer members of the party could sit . Uncle Sam meanwhile had been working away at the fire with the hired man for help ; Auntp 281Susan was making the ice cream herself . They were all having fun in their particular tribal way and Francis was glad to be part of the tribe , for once . It had occurred to him before that his family were at their best down here in Maine . " Is n't this fun ? " Francis bubbled over in his enthusiasm . " I wonder why , " John said cautiously , " we all nearly kill ourselves getting ready for it . Rather childish really  --  " " Nonsense , " Francis rebuked him , " you know very well that all this mucking about leads in the end , when the last clam is consumed , to a discussion on Honesty or The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny people we are ! " John noted the " we " but made no comment . As a matter of fact Francis had been excited all day . He had n't seen Ann since that first good talk  --  she was always out sailing , it seemed . But in his mind 's eye he held the image of her standing on the rocks , straight and gold . For the first time he had felt the wildness in her , which was partly the child wildness he knew when they ran off together by themselves to the woods , and partly a grown-up wildness , something free and open , and rather grand , something that spent itself without calculating , that moved about in life with a beautiful unself-conscious thrust . He no longer took Ann for granted . He speculated about her . What had her summer been like ? John and he changed and hurried down to the rocks to help Uncle Sam with the fire , to bring stuff down from the house . By noon the guests had begun to arrive while the heaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clams and corn ; the air was full of sea fragrance . Everyone was dressed in his most cherished old clothes , carrying rugs and , in some cases , folding chairs , and everyone had to say what a perfect dayp 282they had , and to breathe in the mixture of pine and salt and clam and seaweed as if it were an intoxicant . This was the last big shindig of the summer , an immemorial tradition , filled with nostalgiaand parting ; soon these people in their old sweaters and dungarees would be scattered in banks and colleges , so the light did seem particularly beautiful , the sun already stained from gold to a deep rose . It was already autumn light and the sea already an autumn sea , dark blue with an air of containing whales  --  soon the people would not be here any more . Francis sat down unobtrusively and watched the gathering of the clan , setting them in perspective against the immensity around and above them . He was waiting for Ann . But as he waited , lifted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also how precarious this ragged human gathering looked close to those cruel immensities , how frail and gay . Voices out here sounded brilliant and a little lonely like the voices of the gulls . Only Mrs. Bradford looked indestructible , firmly planted in her canvas chair and not willing to be done for in any way . He was sorry to have to get up and help pass out plates , as he had wanted to be able to watch Ann arrive , to have the whole picture of her coming , to run to meet her and to tell her  --  what ? How glad he was that she was there , alive and glowing ? To thank her for being herself just now , just today , now he was a stranger come home ? The waves , poured in and broke on the rocks one after another , but still Ann did not come . Now Uncle Sam was standing like Old Triton with a pitchfork and the great , the crucial moment had arrived . Everyone watched him at this rite and he performed it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're starving , Sam ! Do hurry  --  " But Oh , wait for Ann , Francis wanted to say , as the snakyp 283piles of seaweed were tossed off the fork and the glorious pink lobsters revealed , and everyone sighed with anticipation . " Has everyone got nutcrackers or rocks or some proper instrument ? " Uncle Sam asked like the starter of a race . And at last Ann , her father and mother and two young men poured down from the clifflike rocks and hallooed . " Come on down . There may be a few scraps left ! " Uncle Sam called cheerily . " Are we late ? " Ann leaped , ahead of the others , as light and sure as an Indian , and almost fell into Francis ' arms . She was out of breath , a little startled perhaps to see him there , thrusting a plate into her hands , impatient and commanding . " I thought you 'd never come . Who are those horrible young men you have in tow ? " " Oh you remember Bob  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other one is Andrew , a physicist , terribly learned . He scares me , " she confided , and then with a mischievous glance at Francis who was frowning at them , " but he 's a wonderful dancer . " Francis thought Andrew was helping Ann 's mother down the rocks in a rather filial way . He looked suspiciously at Ann , but did n't have a chance to say anything more as Mrs. Bradford said , " Come over here , Ann . I want to talk to you . " She never raised her voice , but it carried , Francis sometimes thought , to the remotest corners of the earth . Ann gave Mrs. Bradford her plate while Francis went to fetch another , feeling extremely disgruntled . " Francis looks depressed , " Mrs. Bradford said wickedly . " Does he ? " Ann said in an offhand way , " I thought he p 284seemed very cheerful . " But when she glanced up to find Francis , he was standing with the full plate in his hand as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor ! " she called and met his startled glance . " You 'd make a very poor waiter , Francis . " " What have I forgotten ? " he asked nervously , " Oh yes  --  the corn , " and he disappeared again , looking flustered . When he came back he found that Ann had moved over to where Bob , Andrew and John were sitting some distance away on a round flat rock . It was always like this at first , everyone doingas he pleased , and that was what was nice . A gang of the men , Francis noticed , had gone off by themselves ; their harsh happy laughter cut across the discreet murmur from Mrs. Bradford 's corner , and Francis remembered how annoyed his mother had been by this New England habit of dividing the sexes . " Barbarous , " she called it . Almost imperceptibly in the last half hour Francis had become an observer and not a participant ; his old critical isolated self was back again . He sat down alone , to eat ravenously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was haunted by the voices from Ann 's rock , her own so clear and cool sounding like a flute among the boys ' voices . Finally he got up , collecting some cans of beer as an excuse to crash in , " Hey ! What about some beer ! " But he felt as if the perfectly free gaiety of their group changed with his arrival . After all , they had all the summer pleasures they had shared in common , and all the summer jokes . He made himself busy opening cans , trying to assume the protective coloring of the place . But he knew very well that he was supercharged by his morning excitement and now all the confusion of his feelings . He was not one of them , careless and happy as gods. p 285He felt that Ann was making an effort to include him when she asked , " What were you thinking about all by yourself , Christopher Columbus ? " Francis colored , " I do n't know  --  nothing , I guess ... " " No long , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be looking across to France  --  " " Hell no , " Francis said abruptly . Above all he did not want to be reminded now of France . " Tell me about the summer , " he said turning to Bob . " That 's what I want to know . " " Ann and I got second place in the races , a pure fluke , I must say . The Peabodys upset halfway through the course and held up two other craft . Boy , that was a lucky day ! As a matter of fact , Ann 's quite a sailor , " he said possessively . " Nonsense , I obey orders , that 's all . " " A rare trait in a woman , " Bob chuckled . " I wish she 'd obey my orders , " Andrew said significantly . " Get me some more of this delicious mess , Andrew , and do n't be silly , " Ann said . What struck Francis was her atmosphereof ease and  --  he hesitated , but decided it was the truth  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin while he was away , had emerged , all whole and shining . The contrast with his own confused state of mind about her was almost too vivid . Francis felt more and more depressed . Happiness , he thought , is the great barrier , like riches , of any sort . The poor ca n't talk to the rich . " When do you go back to work ? " he asked , wanting to know all about her , wanting , painful as it was , to hold time back , not to have the summer , the week , even the day slip through his fingers . " I 'm thinking of taking a year off , of going to England p 286maybe , to find out what 's going on there . I have an idea that the whole approach to social work must be different in a socialist state , " she said turning her whole attention to Francis for the first time , as if she were glad for this chance to talk . " The danger in my profession is that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live out all my peoples ' problems instead of my own , " she said looking out to sea now , and half smiling . " When you get to that point , you cease to be any good . " " How long have you been working , Ann ? " Andrew asked . Francis could see how he admired her and for the first time , it pleased him instead of annoying him . That was because he had divined in the last half hour that she was not the least bit interested in Andrew . " Four years . " She gave a great " Ouf ! " and then sighed , " it seems like a lifetime . " " One gets to be as old as the hills , " Bob said humorously . " Look at Ann . She talks as if she were a hundred . " " You know why ? " Francis sat up , suddenly involved , part of the group at last because he was interested and he saw that their problems were his problems . And these were his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own age . It felt good . " I think we work too hard , we Americans . There are n't enough spaces  --  how many people ever get a chance or take the time to sit around for a couple of months ? " " We manage pretty well here , " Bob grinned . " I have n't cracked a book since June . " It was not quite what Francis meant . He caught Ann 's eye and they both laughed . Their laugh included Bob , but it said , " Good old Bob . " It said , We know . Francis felt the hap-p 287piness come back as swiftly and completely as if the sun had come out from behind a cloud. - " I want to talk to you , " he said , " we have n't even begun . " " Any time , " Ann smiled her clear smile , " Bob just told you I 'm very obedient . " It was time for Francis to make himself useful but this time he got up gladly because he carried Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream and cups of coffee around . The rocks were littered now with lobster shells . The time for generalconversation had begun and Aunt Sukey was marshalling the scattered groups round the fire . All this was traditional , easy , because it had all been done for many many summers and before they parted they really wanted to know all the things that had not been said more casually . " Tell us a little bit about your work , Andrew , " Aunt Sukey started the ball rolling . It would go from one to another , as the group emerged into amazingly different individuals and individuallives . Andrew gave a modest and charming little speech about atomic physics and this led to an all-out discussion of the bomb in which Mr. Endicott grew perfectly furious and Mrs. Bradford provided the ice of peace finally when things almost got out of hand . Francis , looking around at the group , centerednow round the warmth of the fire , wondered if ever beforepersonal lives had been set against such a huge dark background of fear and conflict . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endicott , savage individualist , and Carradine , the mathematician , who was if not a communist , certainlya fellow traveler . Here on the safe American rocks , they could still turn over these matters as matters for speculation. p 288But for how long ? When would the personal world split open and terrible decisions face them and divide them ? Francis , more than usually alive to all that was going on around him , looked over at Ann with a constricted heart . It seemed amazing that for three months he had lived entirely on his own sensations and emotions , as if they were important . Now he wanted to plunge into the work ahead . He had not noticed that Ann 's turn had come , but now he turned to her eagerly . How often he had changed the subject when she talked about her work ! Now he listened as if he had to learn everything all at once , to make up for years of selfish indifference , years when he had been too involved in his own problems even to see Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the temporary homes for childrenbrought in by the S.P.C.C. A baby three years old black and blue all over , the last of seven children , the one his mother just could n't take , talked about it quietly as if these things could be taken almost for granted in the world of poverty , of sufferingwhich had become her everyday world . But under the plain direct sentences , the full charge of her compassion and anger came through . It was almost as if she were accusing the intelligentaware faces around her who knew so much about atomic warfare and its dangers and so little about the starvation and cruelty only a few doors away . And when she had finished , she was suddenly shy . Their attention troubled her . She turned to Francis putting a hand to her heart with a queer little gesture as if she were hurt . " It 's hard to stay dispassionate , " she said quietly , " I did n't mean to make such a revivalist speech . " " Gee , " said Bob , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just waking up , " the things we do n't know . " p 289Francis said nothing . He was thinking too many things . He was thinking how Ann should have children , children she could bring up herself , not other people 's children . He was thinking too , and it stirred him deeply , that this concern , this sense of responsibility , this willingness of the privileged to work for the underprivileged was something peculiarly American . Slowly while John talked about the anti-communist bills that were to come up in the Massachussetts Legislature and why they must be fought , Francis looked at one face after another in the group . There was old Mr. Peabody who had spent his life trying to get the standards of teacher training raised in the public schools . There was Mr. Endicott who gave a dozen scholarshipsa year to Harvard for boys on the wrong side of the Hill . There were the Cabot twins who had spent this summer and the last in Mexico with a Quaker group building schools . Education and all that it could mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They believed in the continualemergence of the uncommon man from every group and perhaps especially from the underprivileged groups . Suddenly Francis felt humble before them , felt how much he had to do to be worthy of them , even a fussy old eccentric like Mr. Endicott . " They 're all so terribly good , " he had said to Solange , but now he felt it in a different way . And most of all , he felt it about Ann . He was haunted by that unconscious gesture she had made of putting her hand to her heart , by the way she had turned to him apologetically , . by the slightly bitter self-deprecatory twist of her mouth . He knew now clearly why he had come back . But at the same time , knowing it , he thought he knew that it had become impossible . Solange and all that had happened in Parisp 290made it impossible . One does n't love two people in the same way . Only a heel could do that , could move so fast from one such personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Francis looked up , winced , and said quietly , " I 'm sorry , Aunt Susan . I do n't think I have anything to say , not after all we 've been hearing . Maybe next year  --  then I might have something to bring and not just everything to learn from this group . " " Mercy , Francis , such humility does n't suit you at all , " Mrs. Bradford said sharply . At this moment of honesty , Francis felt cut off . He should have known better , and he looked despairinglyat Ann but she had turned away and was looking out to sea , the slight flush of excitement from her speech still in her cheeks . When the party broke up , though Ann looked for him , Francis seemed to be avoiding her . He made himself very busy picking up litter , though he caught the quick hurt look in her eyes , the elaborate casualness with which she called , " Goodbyethen , Francis . Come over before you go . " Intolerable bungler that I am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days that he could spend an amazing amount of time doing nothing . A little like a sleepwalker , he went down to the grocer and drank Cokes and got the morning papers ; he played tennis with John ; he lay on the rocks for hours in a half-waking , half-dreaming state of consciousnessin which he carried on long dialogues with himself and got nowhere . But the day came when , half asleep on a rock he stood up suddenly and realized that he had only one more week here . He was shaken with loneliness at the very idea . And he walked over to Alan 's house as if he were in some great trouble . Alan was sitting on the front porch reading a French novel . The house was blessedly empty of Mrs. Bradford who had gone out to lunch . " I hoped you 'd come around , " Alan said . " I 've hardly seen you and I 've been thinking that the winter will be strange without you , Francis . " " I know . In some ways I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead as if he were rubbing out an imagep 292behind his eyes . " I feel rather peculiar about leaving , as a matter of fact . It 's quite a wrench . I had n't expected that . " " Well , you 've conquered the last bastion  --  my mother , " Alan said smiling his Buddha smile . " That is quite a triumph . " " You 're not going to let her persuade you to live in Chestnut Hill , are you , Alan ? " Francis asked anxiously . " I 'm afraid my walking out on you like this will have made it a bit harder than it might have been . " " What would you think of my trying to get Alison to come over and keep house while you 're away ? I 'm sure she never has proper meals . It might be good for her and it would be a help . . . " Alan said tentatively . " I was going to suggest it myself , only I did n't quite dare . It 's a wonderful idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less lonely than in his moment of panic on the rock . It would be good to know that the two people he was fondest of in the family would be together in the house . For the house had assumed great importance in his mind since he had come back . He felt that it was his house now , and not merely his mother 's house . He felt responsible for the kind of life that would be lived there . " We 'll only be holding the fort till you come back with a wife , " Alan said , looking out to sea and not at Francis , deliberately . " Oh , I shall never marry , " Francis said quickly . " Why not ? " Alan sat up , startled . It was not the answer he had expected . " It 's become impossible . I ca n't tell you why . " Francis closed up like a clam . He felt very much confused . They sat , Alan in the wicker armchair , Francis on the steps , p 293and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pines sounded like waves . The air had a tang in it and all around them the stillness , the sun-soaked peace flowed , punctuated by a large bee who flew into a snapdragon by the steps , pushed down the lip of the flower with firm legs , and disappeared . Francis watched it attentively . His mind was a complete blank . " I know you 've been hurt , Francis , " Alan said after waiting for Francis to change the subject if he wished , " but I imagined , perhaps wrongly , that you and Solange had come to some sort of understanding before you left . I mean , a good understanding . " " Yes , " Francis said slowly , " I think we did . " " And yet you feel so bitter ? " Alan probed gently . " Oh , it 's not that , not that at all , " Francis said quickly . " No , I know , " Alan said with a flash of intuition . He had observed Francis and Ann at the picnic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you 're able yet to admit , Francis . But sooner or later you 'll have to take a leap and recognize it . " " I 've been a beast to Ann since we were grown up  --  and this is the final beastliness , " Francis said miserably . He felt literally torn in two . " What ? " " Feeling like this about her now  --  just now  --  after all those years , just now , when she knows about Solange and everything . I feel like a monster . " " I see . " Alan lit a cigarette and offered Francis one . " It 's everything I ever dreamed of , " Francis said quietly , " and I 've made it impossible . " " What makes you think that ? Perhaps on the contrary you have made it possible  --  " p 294 " Possible for me , yes . Not for her . She 'd always imagine she was a substitute . " " She would if it were true . Ann is a very honest person . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis got up and clenched his fist on the porch railing . " I do n't know . How can I know ? " " Perhaps I should n't say this , Francis , but I think it may help . Solange talked to me about you , you probably guessed that . One of the things she found difficult was the terrific tensionyou created  --  she said there was never any peace . " " I was trying to gather the wind . All the time it was all escaping  --  the wind and all the stars . All the time I was starving , dying of thirst in a desert . I do n't understand yet why . " " She opened all your hungers and thirsts  --  " " Yes , yes she did , " Francis turned to him almost savagely . " That 's just what she did . Hunger for work , for religion even  --  more than anything for the kind of love you can build on , grow with . . . " " She opened your hunger for Ann , Francis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passion like that is a great catalyser but it is n't an answer to any hunger , not even the hunger for itself . " Francis stared Alan full in the face as if to read his heart . " If I could only believe you , Alan . If I could only believe you were n't just trying to help  --  I know you are . But how does one ever know the truth about oneself ? " " By taking a leap . Marriage is rather like religion , Francis , not , if you 'll forgive my saying so , the vague aspirations you felt in Paris , but the real thing , the thing that changes one 's life  --  there comes a time when you just have to take a leap in p| 295the dark . When you have to believe in the impossible , just in the impossible , and in nothing less than the impossible . You can believe me . " " Do you know , Alan , really ? " Francis asked and now it was his turn to sound severe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he smiled a mischievous smile , " After all , it 's harder to take the leap when you 're fifty than when you 're twenty-six . " " My mother was not Ann . " " No , " Alan said quietly , " your mother could only come a little way to meet me . Ann will come the whole way to meet you , if you give her the chance . " " I do n't see why she should , after the way I 've behaved . Ann is so straight  --  what will she do with a person who comes to her by such a devious path ? " The more he thought about Ann , the more humble Francis felt . " I would n't underrate Ann 's powers of understanding , Francis . " " I 'd like a drink , " said Francis as if he were just waking up after a week 's sleep . " As usual , I 'm the world 's fool . Do fools always have such wise friends ? " he said with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wrong . It would be too terrible to think of. p 296FRANCI S WOKE to the American light , full , blazing sunlight on the walls of his room and realized that it was after nine . He stood at the window shivering , for it was suddenly autumn , and looked out at a dark blue sea . Yes , it was autumn . The Virginia creeper on the garage had turned deep crimson  --  overnight ? He did not remember noticing it before . Now whatever it had been yesterday , every edge was sharply defined , every leaf stood out and for a moment he tried to remember what the Paris light had been beside this  --  that gentle envelope which turned hard stone transparent and touched everything with mystery . How different was the September morning ! One might drink this air , he thought and need no other drink , and yet it was implacable as well as nourishing . It made the most mysteriousobject look plain and bright . And if it was time one thought of in Paris , the great river of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each moment was strangely isolated and brilliant , and to be lived as if it were in itself the center of eternity . Francis was thankful that he would not have to speak to a soul this morning  --  they had all had breakfast long ago.  --  296  --  p 297He got himself a glass of orange juice from the icebox and then went out and sat for half an hour on a rock , looking at the sea . There had been wind in the night , though now the air was absolutely still but the sea remembered the wind as he remembered his long wakeful hours ; the waves rolled themselvesup one after another and broke in great white towers against the rocks , and the crevasses spilled over and churned with foam . Only far off all was calm , deep dark blue which seemed to absorb rather than reflect the sky . Too rough for sailing , Francis noted . He felt extremely and completely wide awake though he had only had a few hours sleep . And when he got up he thought , Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he stood at the top of the hill and looked down at the Charles river asleep and when he had asked himself , " Do I exist ? " Now , remembering it , he smiled . It was such a sure thing that he existed , all of him , from the hair on his head to the soles of his feet , climbing back up the rocks easily , in sneakers , such a sure thing that instead of answering the question he began to sing in a loud happy voice , " What shall we do with the lazy sailor ? What shall we do with the lazy sailor ? What shall we do with the lazy sailor , early in the morning ? " He was answered by the derisive screams of the gulls . But what a plain grand day it was , this day in a life , this one day ! He found her where he wanted to find her , down in the wood , chopping again . He took the ax from her without a word and this time went at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " There . " " Hello , " she said then , " where have you come from all of a sudden ? " " Ann , " she was standing just above him leaning against ap 298birch tree . If he had never seen her before he saw her now , every line sharp as he had seen the leaves and the sea when he woke up , and seeing her , he found no word to say except her name . So , very quietly as if every moment counted , he took a cigarette and offered her one and lighted them both , carefully . " Did you say something ? " she asked lightly . It 's now , he told himself , now . But still the leap was there to be made and he could not quite make it . She was not going to help him . Perhaps even she did n't know what he had come to ask . " Oh Ann , " he sat down on the leaves and the moss , " Ann . " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . " It 's a grand day , " she said , looking off through the trees to a tiny glimpse of the sea . " Ann , " he said again , and then as she did n't answer , he went on to say anything , " I 've hardly seen you all week . " " I 've been busy sailing  --  what have you been doing ? " " Thinking  --  about you , " he said with a funny cracked voice . " Sit down . I ca n't talk to you like that . You 're too far away . " Obediently she sat down , her arms curled round her knees . But now Francis was perfectly silent . All around him the little sounds went on , a leaf falling , a chipmunk flashing past , a jay calling loudly to another jay . But inside Francis there was only an immense stillness . She was about three feet away from him and he could see the smoke curling up in the still air from her cigarette . This silence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak he became used to not speaking and after a while , he felt himself relax , enter into the moment , the one moment which was to be for him the center of time forever afterwards . Hep 299waited until all his fear and embarrassment had ebbed away into the wood , until everything true and peaceful , everything that can grow and breathe had come slowly to the surface , and then he reached over and pulled her arm away from her knees and took her hand . When it was firmly clasped in his , he sighed as if he had been holding his breath . " There , " he said again . " That 's what you said when the tree fell , " she said in a matter of fact voice , but now he had made the leap it did n't matterwhat she said . The bridge was thrown over the abyss . They had met and her hand was clasped in his , so hard there was no hunger between them , only arrival . " Oh , Ann . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , so simple , so clear touched him like sunlight . And he waited for them to go down to his heart before he spoke . " I never thought it could be like this . I never thought there would be any peace , any time , any place where I could stay still and not be pursued . Oh , Ann "  --  the kiss which had stood between them , an insurmountable problem , now joined them and solved itself quite simply , like a leaf falling . It was a grave , not a passionate kiss , in which they both forgave each other for all the years of separation . Ann leaned against Francis ' shoulder and as he put an arm around her he felt all at once like a brother and a father and a very good husband all rolled up into one . He knew how it would be always , how their two strengths would rest on each other . " I really gave you up , you know  --  last winter , after that horriblewalk . " She laughed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feelings , especially this . " I guess I had to . Justp 300as you had to come alive away from me , I had to die away from you , had really to give you up . It made me free for the first time in my life . That sounds strange , " she ended , laying her hand very gently in his . " I think it takes a long time to get to the simplest things  --  they 're the hardest to learn . " And then Francis sat up and turned to her eagerly to tell her everything . " I had all the wrong ideas always . You see , " he said , frowning the frown she knew so well . Indeed so familiar was his face to her , so much a part of her , that she hardly saw Francis . She just felt with him . " You see , " he went on , hunting down the words , " I thought because of my father and mother , I guess , that I had to be exceptional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's . All that tosh about never falling in love  --  " " Yes , " Ann grinned , " you were pretty awful , I must say . " " Then when I did fall in love it had to be Solange , someoneimpossible  --  really , Ann , because I was so scared of it , and I could go on insisting on suffering as if agony were a kind of brilliance . It was all false , " he said harshly . " No , " Ann said quietly , " you must n't say that . No love is false . It would n't be fair to say that  --  fair to her , " she said because she could n't quite bring herself to say the name , just now . He looked up quickly to meet her clear gaze and blurted out , " Do you know why I love your face ? " " Do n't interrupt . I want to hear the rest . " " It 's not an interruption . Listen , I love your face because it 's such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on your face as if it felt at home . " " Darling , " she blushed , " you 're lyrical . It embarrasses me . " " Well , not all American faces are like that , God knows . p 301Most of us look like cows , bland and empty . Or worn thin by the arid emptiness inside , wooden faces , cow faces . But there is also yours to make me remember if I ever forget , that at best there is this human simple clarity and from that almost any thing can be built  --  first of all , a family , " he said , looking shyly at her now himself , as if perhaps he had gone too far . " We 'll have to be awfully good , Francis , we 're so happy . " She did n't answer him directly . " I feel practically a saint already , " Francis laughed , " do n't you ? " " Moderately human anyway , " she teased . " Listen , Ann , " Francis was serious again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have to talk about it ever again . When I came back , almost at once , I knew about us , you and me , I mean . But you see I felt like a criminal . It did n't seem right , or possible to come back from all that in Paris and be so faithless , so soon ... " Ann sat up quite straight and looked off through the trees . " It must be quite clear between us , Ann , must n't it ? " " You do n't have to explain , Francis . I think I understand . You wo n't perhaps ever be in love with me as you were with her , but you must n't worry . I do n't think I would want just that from you . It 's something deeper than romantic between you and me  --  that 's why it took us so long . " " Yes , we 're going to want our lives together , not only our love , our whole lives and our children  --  " he smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I would n't worry about being faithless , " Ann said . Seeing the tense look back in his eyes , she wanted above all to comfort him , to bring him back to peace . " I think maybep 302Solange "  --  now she said the name , she caught her breath just a little  --  " will be like poetry to you always , and must be like that , but I 'll be  --  what shall I be ? "  --  she turned to him with a shadow of a smile  --  " bread and bed and house and home . " " And dear love , dear love , not terrible love , " he murmured . " I ca n't get used to it , Ann , that it 's ours , that it 's going to be always here . It 's very silly but I 've grown to expect blows . " " I expect there 'll be some , but we 'll meet them together , " she said quietly . Francis was lying back again in the leaves looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder what kind of shadow a man casts , " he said dreamily . " A plain human shadow , I guess , " she said , wondering what he meant . " Yes , that 's it , " Francis sat up in great excitement . " You see in Paris I talked to an awfully wise friend of father 's and he said it was dangerous to be so free , that it was like being a god and gods cast long shadows . But now at last I can have my own shadow , the shadow of a man . It means all kinds of things , Ann . It means responsible love ; it means what I can do in teaching , and as a father and as a human being , and it means maybe what I can be as an American , an everyday kind of person really "  --  he smiled as if it made him immensely and quietly happy to be just that  --  " for that 's what we believe in , is n't it ? In the unlimited power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , half-ashamed of all this talk . " I 'm talking too much . " " Hey , kids , where are you ? " It was Alan 's voice , high up the hill among the trees . " It 's Alan , how lovely ! We can tell him first , " Ann scrambledup and gave a long call , " Hoo  --  000  --  come down , Alan ! " p 303Then she turned back to Francis and gave him a long look beforeanyone , even Alan , broke this magic circle they had drawn around themselves . " I love you , even when you talk nonsense , " she grinned , " and that was n't nonsense . Pm glad you have a real shadow at last . " Now they could hear Alan crashing down through the leaves , and groaning . " Where are you ? I 'm getting fearfully scratched . " " Make a last effort , Alan ; we have a secret to tell you . " There he was , panting a little , his face scratched by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better be a good secret , " he said crossly . " It is . We 're going to be married , " Francis stood beside Ann , one arm flung over her shoulder . They stood there , suddenlyself-conscious , smiling foolishly as Alan surveyed them . " You look ridiculously young , " he granted , and then came over to kiss them both . " Do n't say you always knew it , " Ann commanded , " or we 'll bite you . It was a very close thing , was n't it , Francis , and we feel rather triumphant . For it might not have happened at all , " she said mischievously . " I might have married someone else . " Alan stood back now as if he were about to decorate them and took a little box out of his pocket . " I wo n't say I always knew it , but I just thought I 'd bring you something , Ann . " He looked mysterious and pleased . " Here it is . " " What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatch it out of her hands . " Oh , " Ann said . The box contained a diamond brooch . " How lovely ! " " Yes , Persis told me to give this to Ann when she marriedp 304  --  and she did n't say when you married Francis , " he told Ann with a grin . " Let me see it , " Francis took it from her . " It 's beautiful , " he said , looking up to catch her smile . " Darling , do n't cry . " Ann tossed her head . " I 'm not crying , " she said , " but Oh I wish your mother were here ! " " She 's here , " Alan said matter-of-factly . " She would be pleased , I think . " Francis held Ann 's hand in his with that firm handclasp which told her everything she needed to know . " At last I can really believe she would be pleased , " and he gave a long sigh of contentment . All around them the sunlight splashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p 240as if one could make a choice , as if one could turn love on and off like a faucet . How can I stop one day , just like that , say to myself , Today I shall stop loving Solange , ' and go away ? I do n't understand , " Francis said more humbly . With his whole being he resisted Fontanes , resisted the truth . For in his heart he knew that it was the truth , but how could he accept it  --  yet ? " Oh , I expect you 'll be feeding on this for years , my dear Francis , " Fontanes said ironically , but with a shade of compassion , " but also you will be living all the time , living your own life . Little by little you will find that it is quite possible to go along , you know . Work , too , can become a passion . And if you are a teacher , a real one , you 'll spend your life renouncing , so you may as well learn how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking sidelong glance . But Francis looked moodily ahead , seeing nothingexcept the road , hardly thinking . He felt numb . " What a narrow range a love affair has , at best , " Fontanes went on , for he had not finished what he must say once and for all . " It 's an essence . You ca n't live on an essence . " " It opens the world , " Francis said out of his dream . And Fontanes laughed not his roar of laughter , but a gentle laugh , " My dear , it does n't open the world . It opens you  --  and you may imagine in your madness that you are the world , but you soon find out that you 're not . Of course , " he conceded , " I expect this was just what you needed , you were such a little Puritan when you arrived  --  But I still do n't like it . " " I suppose , " Francis said , frowning , " that it is a madness , really . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of us , in these last years  --  slow down , " he commanded , " look at those people fishing , there by the poplars , with their picnic basketp 257textbook he would have to follow ? He thought he had better write a letter to the head of the department and find out just where he stood . And to do this he must first draw up a plan of what he would like to teach . He lay around most of the morning , making notes on a small pad , taking books out of the library and not putting them back so he was soon sitting in a disorder of records and books and empty milk glasses and cigarette stubs , and his mother 's room had ceased to be hers and become his own . After four or five hours of this he went up to his bedroom and lay down . The house , now he had stopped moving about in it , was very still . And the air weighed heavy in the heat . The heaviness and the stillness kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken by some ominous sound , a thunderclapor a large rat scuttling across the floor . The house no longer seemed aware of his presence , and his sense of his own reality , so acute the day before , began to ebb . With the ebbing , the pain he had feared came back . The emptiness . Would he ever see Solange again ? But if so , never never again as he had seen her , lost in sleep by his side . How can I go on being what she made me , alone , he asked himself ? And then , how long does it take to forget some things ? In seven years one has a new skin , they say . In that time does the blood forget ? What do people do , he thought ? How does one live ? It had been too quick , too sudden , this flowering of all of himself and then the cutting off . And the spirit could move at this speed , but not the body . Memory which comes so much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again and again to tear his peace to pieces , whatever his mind knew and had accepted . He lay and tossed through the long hot after-p 258noon and got up at four , thoroughly demoralized . He could n't face the mess in the drawing room . Where would he go ? And then he suddenly remembered Aunt Alison . It was just possible that she was here . The telephone was cut off . The easiest thing to do would be to walk over there . Francis went out in his shirtsleeves , dungarees and sneakers and wondered , hearing the door snap shut behind him , if he would ever have the courage to go back . " Why , Francis ! I thought you were in Paris ! " Aunt Alison opened the door wide . " Too hot to kiss anyone , " she said smiling and Francis loved her for being so pleased to see him , " but welcomehome . I 'm just making some iced tea . " Francis sat down on the old sofa and looked around him enjoyingall the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkbook on the mantelpiece , Aunt Alison herself , but she looks tired , he thought . " The last time you wrote you were all set to study all winter  --  what brings you back into this inferno ? " " This apartment must be hell . You should have moved over into the big house , " and then , delighted with his inspiration , Francis got up and followed her into the tiny kitchen to say , " Why not come over now ? You could have the guest room . It 's the coolest room in the house . " " Well , " she turned to pat his arm gently , " we 'll talk about that , Francis . First I want to hear all about you . What on earth happened to bring you home ? I do n't suppose you gambled away all your money ? " she teased . " No , I got a job , teaching French to advanced students at a little college in Iowa . " p 122smile . It was obvious that Madame was nervous and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delighted . Francis ran through the next days like a horse who has felt the spur . He got tickets for Claudel 's play and telephoned Solange to tell her so and to arrange to have lunch with her the following day . He had so many plans suddenly and definite desires that he did not even try to see her immediately . He spent the morning buying books , all he could find of Bergson , of Maine de Biran , of Lachelier , Ravaisson , Boutroux , these names which he knew because he had heard his mother speak of them because they had been the strong influence on his father 's thought . It was strange until now that he had felt no curiosity to explore his father 's mind . He had shied away from his father except as a flat symbol around which gathered his revolt against New England and Boston . He carried his pile of books back to the pension and lay down on his bed , forgetting all about lunch till half past three , read as if he had never read before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with all he had to learn . When he went out into the street looking for a cafe where he could eat something , he was astonished by the quality of the light , this European light which did n't bounce off the buildings and dazzle , but seemed to penetrate everything , so the long row of identical housefronts became strangely luminous and transparent . Everything seemed new ; he stopped for a moment by a vegetable store to stare at the baskets of leeks , carrots , Spanish onions , rows of damp lettuce and large bunches of Belgian grapes lying like flowers on beds of cotton wool . " Can I serve you ? " " No  --  no thank you . " Francis walked on to the end of the p 180He wanted Alan now , Alan in all the world because Alan must understand all this . Could a woman ever understand it ? Had his mother understood it ? " It 's all right , Francis , " Solange heard herself saying because in the last few minutes she had become his mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had known would be fatal , had happened . Either she hated and fought him now , who threatened her in the very quick of her senses , or she became his mother . " One has to learn these things . One has to experience them . I could n't tell you  --  at least not until now . . . " " No , " he groaned , a heavy groan . " Ca n't we go back ? Yesterday , the day before , it was so happy  --  ca n't we go back ? " " To love , darling , yes , " she said quietly , " I love you very much , you know . " He got up and walked up and down restlessly , energy pouringback into him through the very force of his emotion . " I felt all the time as if I was fighting death last night . It was death that was taking you away from me  --  and I could n't win , could I ? No one can . It was that  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and held it a moment in hers very gently . " To think that Pierre and Persis could have produced such a romantic , " and she laughed . " Do n't laugh at me , " he said very quietly , " I could n't bear it . " " My dear , sit down . " She pulled him down beside her on the chaise longue . " You must n't be so distressed . It 's just life , you know . You want to be human . Well , remember , this is human , all this . We are n't gods , even though we may think so for a little while . "
