Beginning next week , with the issue of June 7 , readers in the Territory of Hawaii will start getting the U.S. edition of TIME in place of the Pacific edition , which they have received in the past . <P> TIME began printing its Pacific edition , now one of the four international editions ( the others : Atlantic , Latin American and Canadian ) in Honolulu during the war . This edition was distributed in Hawaii , the Pacific Ocean area and the Far East . After the war TIME also started printing in Tokyo . Early this year , transportation and supply facilities had improved to the extent that it was logistically and economically feasible to consolidate all our Pacific printing in the one plant in Tokyo . Plans were made to close down the Honolulu printing operation . <P> With this change we also decided to do something that we had wanted to do for some time : send the U.S. edition of TIME to the Territory of Hawaii . And now , I am pleased to announce that plans are completed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the early press run at our Los Angeles printing plant will be marked " Air Speeded Edition . " These weekly shipments will be loaded aboard planes in Los Angeles and 9 hours later will arrive in Honolulu ready for distribution . <P> In the U.S. edition the readers in the Islands will be getting the same TIME editorial content as they did in the Pacific edition . The only difference will be in advertising content . The advertisements in the Pacific edition are naturally aimed at customers in Asia and the Far Pacific . Hawaii is part of the American market . Last year , for example , the Islands imported $400 million worth of goods from the States . Particularly as statehood gets closer , it is only logical that readers in Hawaii should get the U.S. edition . TIME is glad to add this one additional tie between the mainland and the Islands . <P> Cordially yours ,
