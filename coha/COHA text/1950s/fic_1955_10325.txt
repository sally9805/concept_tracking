, in John 's eyes , of course , she had betrayed him by announcing that she had no faith in her work . It was true , though not in the sense that the vicomte had understood . " You did n't have to say it , " she heard her husband 's voice proclaim . " I was upset , " she mentallydefended herself . " How would you feel if he had just bought your portrait ? " And she had been upset , she supposed  --  more than she had consciously realized . Everything Miles did unnerved her , every word she heard of him , though she did not always feel it straight off . " That horrible man , " she said aloud , remembering his drawling voice , and his elbows , in their hideous hairy tweed , resting on their car door , the other day at the Goes ' . If he came to see them , as he had threatened to do , she would not , she clearly foresaw , have the force to prevent him . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have the boldness to tell him that he had no right to come there . She heard the car door slam , down the hill by the garage , and ransacked her mind for something to tell John that would divert him from the subject of the portrait  --  something amusing or very serious . But as she watched him , coming up the hill , with a determined , purposeful step , there were only words running through her head : value , posterity , truth.  |p101IT  WAS Martha 's theory that people , whatever they said , did in the end what they wanted . The only exception she knew of was her relation with Miles . With Miles she had done steadily what she hated , startingfrom the moment she married him , violently against her will . " You wanted to , all right , " he used to growl at her , but she knew that it was not true . She had no explanation for this strange fact about herself . She was timid but not supine ; nobody , except Miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her friends had told her : when she met him , she had been an untried girl , who had not found herself , as the phrase was . If that was the case ( and even John seemed to think so ) , she should have outgrown her fear of Miles during the intervening years ; she felt much stronger , certainly . Yet , to her horror , the other day at the Goes ' , when she was face to face with Miles , the years between vanished and she had begun to tremble again , as she had not trembled since the night she had left him . This awful weakness in herself she dared not confess to John , chiefly for fear of troubling him with something that was inexplicable . She did not like Miles , but she did not dislike him either , apart from his effect on her . Now that she was free of him , she saw his good points and his drawbacksin her customary clear perspective . Here in the New Leeds region , he had a certain stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and read a great deal , seriously . He might yet produce something worth while in the new field he had roamed into  --  the history of ideas ; he was forceful and energetic , with a gift for amassing information that was like his prodigies at the table . . . . His trouble , Martha had decided , was that his talent was crushed by his ambition ; he had wanted to be another Goethe and had ended up as a rolling stone . And he had no facility of expression . She herself , she now perceived , had qualities Miles envied : a sharp ear and a lively natural style . There was therefore no reason why she should tremble before him , when she knew him , moreover , to be selfish , brutal , and dishonest in his domestic life . Her weakness in his presence must , she supposed , be explained by that mysterious entity known as power . But this did not take her much further , because she did not understand power , either the desire for it or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was near Miles , obedience that was not based either on rational consent or on rational fear . But she had obeyed Miles , when she was married to him , without knowing why . This irrational element , this bewilderment before her own actions , had been present from the very beginning ; she had ceased to know herself from the moment she met Miles . She was just out of college then , where she had been voted " most literary " as well as " best actress . " Her teachers said " Martha can do anything . " She herself was not sure yet whether she really wanted to try to be an actress , which was what her class book predicted , or to write poetry , her earliest interest , or to plug ahead and do graduate work , which was what her favorite teacher advised . Her father was sending her an allowance so that she could take her time . She was engaged to a youngp103man who had two more years , still , of architectural school ; she hau just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid for ; she was acting small parts in a shoestring summer theater  --  when Miles , a friend of the producer , drifted in one terrible evening , after a bad performance , and started bulldozing her into marriage before she really knew him . It was what she needed , he assured her , appraising her with his jellied green eyes when she woke up , for the second time , in bed with him , after a lot of drinks . And because she had found herself in bed with him , against her natural inclinations ( for he seemed immensely old to her , being well over forty while she was not yet twenty-one ) , she had concluded that he must be right . He knew what was best for her , doubtless  --  she needed a steadying force , a man , as he said , with a mind . She went back to the theater dormitory and sat on her bed , stoically , like a lump . She did not understand what had happened . She had only , she bemoaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successful , positive , interested in her ideas and life-history . And yet he must be right ; even her teachers would think so . She would never , surely , have yielded to his embraces , shrinking , as she did , from his swollen belly and big , crooked nose , if some deep urge in herself , which he seemed to understand , had not decreed it . The fatalistic side of her character accepted Miles as a punishment for the sin of having slept with him when she did not love him , when she loved , she still felt , someone else . Nevertheless , she had naively sought a compromise . She had begged Miles merely to live with him , as his mistress . But Miles had held out for marriage , instanter ; he needed a mother for his son . She was still hesitating when the knot was tied and Miles was sitting beside her on the train , his chin sunk on his chest , morosely silent , a stranger , as theyp104journeyed to pick up the boy , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her telegraph her presumptivefiance , in Cambridge , until the ceremony was over . That was Miles . He would not let her give notice to the theater people , either , but made her pack her bags while she was still rehearsing next week 's part . The rest of her marriage , which had lasted four years , was in a way simply a catalogue of the natural things Miles would not let her do . He would not let her fly to Juneau to her father 's funeral , though her mother was ill and wired her the money . He would not let her see her brother off to the war or have him in the house when he came back wounded . He made her change her hair and turn over her small capital to him , after her mother died ; he would never give her an allowance for the household or herself . He held the checkbook and hired and fired the servants , when they had them . He would not let her go to New York , once they had moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get the child vaccinated or inoculated against diphtheria becauseMiles objected . He refused to have her practice birth-control and when she did it , privily , he made terrible scenes at night . He would not let her see her friends or accept an invitation without consulting him first . And , finally , he would not let her leave him . There it was again . She was afraid to leave him , though he had no means of preventing her from doing it at any moment , had she dared . But , improbable as it seemed now , she had felt she could not leave him without his permission . When she finally ran away , it was partly because of John , whom she had secretly fallen in love with , but mainly because Miles , by pushing her out of the house , had seemed at last to give her license . That was why she flew out to the garage , in her nightgown ,  |p105before  he could revoke it . And even at that moment , as she turned on the ignition , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles : he had not really meant for her to go . This unaccountable fear she had often discussed with John . It was exactly , she said , like a phobia , like the fear of dogs or snakes or high places ; reason had nothing to do with it . To tell herself that Miles could not hurt her had no more effect than pointing out that a snake was harmless or a dog did not bite . She knew he could not hurt her , seriously , and she used to force herself to opposehim , on small points , like an acrophobe who makes himself look over a parapet . But it did not work . The more she nerved herself to differ with him , the more fear she felt . It was only a sort of social shame or conscience on Barrett 's behalf that drove her to take stands . She resistedhim because she thought she ought to , in a flurry of hysterical defiance . And the mere act of controverting him made her lose her head . She would find herself arguingexcitedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue would get away from her and turn into something else . Their penultimate quarrel , for example , had exploded in the middle of the night , after a party , when she was carrying out two overflowing pails of garbage and he refused , with a sardonic bow , to hold open the screen door for her . There she was , manifestly , the injuredparty , but instead of leaving it at that and taxing him with it the next day , when he was weakened with a hangover , she immediately distributed the guilt by setting down one pail of garbage and slapping him across his grinning face . She never knew how to make him feel sorry for what he had done . The first night of their marriage , when he had suddenlystruck her , for no reason , as she was climbing into bed , she had looked up at him in mute amazement , toop106startled even to cry . So far as she knew herself , Martha was one of those people who were naturally reasonable , like an open-minded child who listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Miles , from the outset , with a sort of blind purpose , like a mole , had set himself to undermine her sense of credibility : she could not believe what was happening . If she were a real woman , Miles used to tell her , she would learn how to handle him . But something obstinate in her nature refused to be indoctrinated ; her passion for the normal rebelled . She would not exploit his " good " moods , and fear and nervous excitement caused her to fumble their quarrels . The sound of his tread , coming up the stairs , at night , when he had been drinking , made her heart race with terror , even when she had the door locked against him . In fact  --  here again was an oddity  --  she was more frightened on the nights when she had had the courage to turn her doorkey , softly , while he was still downstairs , than when she had left the door unlocked . It was her own guilty temerity , in the face of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , the heavy knock to sound , rattling the whole house , and the step , finally , to lurch away into the guest bedroom . It still made her shiver to think of those nights . She had not been able to get to sleep , even after he was gone and she could hear his snores , like regular paroxysms , coming from down the corridor . Fear would be succeeded by remorse , another form of cowardice ; she always flinched from offending anyone , as if from a blow at herself . She could not bear the picture of humiliation , even in an enemy , even in Miles . The thought of the maid and Barrett listening in their beds , while Miles pounded uncertainlyat the door , a suppliant , made her relent , as often as not , and tiptoe across the room to let him in . It was better , on the whole , to be kicked out of bed andp107to retreat herself to the guest bedi$om than to listen to his exiled snores and be sorry . A psychiatrist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat her . Miles himself used to contend this , in his seignorial style ; he convinced himself that he was doing her a service by letting her have a black eye . It was on the strength of such " insights , " she supposed , that he had begun to take paying patients after she had left him . But even discounting Miles 's opinion , Martha herself had often wondered whether there could be a grain of truth in the charge . Yet if there was anything she knew about herself , it was that she hated violence . She had never received it from John and never , as she assured him wryly , missed it . He objected because she screamed , sometimes , when he came upon her unexpectedly , and her hand sometimes flew up to her face , as if to ward off a blow , when he raised his arm casually , in the midst of a discussion . But she was hoping to get over these reflexes , the last trace of Miles 's influence , as she had got over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of falling , that he had left in his wake . With John , she was a different person , and she was proud of it . She had even been looking forward , secretly , to meeting Miles again , to confront him with her new character . The strange thing was that nobody seemed to have noticed her trembling the other day at the Coes ' , though the pounding of her heart , when Miles came to take her cloak , had been so loud that she thought the whole room must hear it , like a rumbling in somebody 's stomach . She had not seen the Coes since , but John and Dolly Lamb had assured her that she was fine when she asked them , " How did I seem ? " in an apprehensive voice . And John , when she reiterated the question , adding , " Tell me the truth , " appeared a little surprised.  | " You were fine , " he said again , absently : his only criticismwas that she had been too natural and friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was withholdinghis real view , from tact , or else , she possessed , unknown to herself , the power to deceive him . And the last thing she wanted was to have such a power . She had always been able to deceive Miles because he did not know her . He had mistaken both her faults and her virtues . He did not reckon with idealism as a serious factor in life and judged , as he used to say weightily , by actions . He had supposed that she must love him because she had let him seduce her on the very first meeting and because she did not leave him though she continually threatened to do so . This refusal to listen was a form of stupidity that Martha especially abhorred , and she considered Miles well punished for it . If he had ever taken seriously her passionate desire to leave him , she might not ( she now believed ) have been driven to show him in practice how little indeed he knew . To pay attention , for Martha , was the prime human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no reciprocity . The alertness of this faculty was what she prized in John . She wished nothing to be hidden from him , not even the bad parts of her nature . She respected his privacy , because he was a man , but for herself , if she could not be transparent , she did not want to love . It seemed to her , therefore , ominous that the minute Miles re-entered her life , a slight deception began , almostautomatically . She was able to conceal again , like that other person , whom she was supposed to have outgrown . She was both glad and sorry that John had not observed the turmoil she had been thrown into . It cut her off from him ; he no longer knew her , which was perhaps for the best , since she did not know herself . Lookingat Miles , she felt the old central question turned onp109her like an artillery piece . In the twelve years since she had met him , he had not changed at all . She could explain , in a way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , and how , under the circumstances , she had stayed with him so long . But why she had let this man make love to her in the first place remained totally mystifying . Just at this point , when she looked at him and then looked backward , there was a terrifying blank . " Yes , why did you ? " said Dolly Lamb , gently , with a quizzical look at Martha , who had driven over to see her the day after the vicomte 's visit . She was used to Martha 's irruptions into her orderly life and had come up here , only the Saturday before last , to paint the marshes , becauseJohn and Martha had written to tell her that they had found a house she must live in , like Thoreau 's , on a pond . It was a shack , really , that had been used in the fall by duck-hunters  --  two tiny rooms and a kitchen , with only a fireplace to heat them and a kitchen range . At night , in her bunk-bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha had laughed and told her to sleep in woolen socks and sweaters . Dolly feared that she would offend them if she went to Digby and bought an electric blanket ; they were very set in their notions of what was fitting for her . Dolly was a year younger than Martha and still unmarried , which had resigned her to being prescribed for by everybody , as if she had an ailment . She was a distant cousin of John 's and had been at college with Martha , in the class below . She was tall and long-legged and curiouslyflattened out , like a cloth doll that had been dressed and redressed by many imperious mistresses . She had a neat round little face that came to a point unexpectedlyin a firm , slightly jutting chin , short crisp blond hair , of a silvery cast , a silvery quiet laugh , and brightp110silver-blue eyes that shone with a high gleam , as if they had just been polished . Her pink cheeks and ears had a faintly angry , scrubbed look . In her unusual style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said some people ; like a gray nun , said others ; like a mermaid , like a scalloped Spode plate , like a heron , like a shingled , weathered cottage , like a Swiss clock with bells and a maiden inside . It was Dolly 's fate to evoke fanciful comparisons , to be , as Martha said , a posse rather than an esse to everyone who knew her . She was too inscrutable , said Martha ; that was why she had not got married  --  men did not think she was real . John said it was her shyness and the fact that she had been brought up by two eccentricaunts , who had died and left her their money . An orphan , he said , was just a figment who was sentimentalizedby the whole world , like the heroine of a storybook ; Dolly had never had any real privacy to develop herself in . Ever since Martha had known her , she had been under trustees . She was now giving Martha tea and English muffins , which she was toasting with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat and puckered with a frown of concentration ; this thoughtful , anxious , winsome look was typical of all the serious , clever girls she and Martha had been friends with at college . They bent their soft brows in continual perplexity , as if a teacher had just asked them a probing question . Dolly was gentler and more reserved than Martha ; she was ironic where Martha was satiric and modest where Martha was vain . But just these differences , as in two sisters , pointed up the likeness between them  --  a likeness that reassured them , even though they affected to deprecate it . Martha today had come to talk to Dolly about Miles , and she felt a little guilty about it because it was the first time , in seven years , that she had reposed her confidence inp111anybody but John . " I 'll just stop and leave Dolly some tarragon , " she had called out to him , as she drove off . " Have a good time , " he advised , and Martha could not make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I was tight , of course , " she said now , watching her friend butter a muffin . Dolly gave a faint , embarrassedsmile . " Oh , Martha ! " she said . Martha laughed ; she had always liked to shock Dolly . " I 've slept with lots of men when I was tight , " she continued . " You 'd die if I told you how many . " Dolly 's eyes widened in a question . " Not now , of course , " said Martha , quickly . " Years ago . Before I knew John . " Dolly nodded ; she handed Martha the muffin and sought to change the subject slightly . " Miss Prentice , " she said , naming their favorite teacher , " always said you married Mr. Murphy for security . She had seen his picture once in the paper . " The two girls smiled . " Poor Miss Prentice , " murmured Martha . Dolly frowned . " But you never cared about security , " she pondered . Martha nodded gloomily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a silence . " He seemed so old , Dolly , " Martha exclaimed suddenly , setting down her cup and passing her hand across her brow , as if to calm herself . " He has n't changed a bit . I 'd forgotten what he looked like . It gave me a turn to see him and remember myself yielding to his charms . " " I thought you were tight , " objected Dolly . " I was conscious , " cried Martha . " I was n't that tight . I remember everything about it , except one tiny little bit  --  the bit where he says I kissed him . I ca n't remember that at all . The next thing I knew he was taking me into a motel , on the old Post Road . I was afraid we were going to get fleas . I rememberthinking about that all the time . Do you suppose I really did kiss him , Dolly ? " " I do n't know , " said Dolly . " If I did , " said Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss . If it was , I do n't know myself at all , Dolly . All I can remember of my feelings is a sort of vague surprise , as if there were a big misunderstanding going on that ought to be cleared up , before it was too late , but I was too tight and tired to explain it to him . Up to the last minute , in the cabin , with all my clothes off , I was still trying to tell him that he was acting on a mistaken premise . I think I went through with it , as a sort of concession , to get him to listen to what I was trying to say . " She gave a little laugh . " Did you mind , Martha ? " said Dolly , sympathetically . " Not specially , " said Martha . " It just seemed to me beside the point for him to be making love to me . I was n't either drawn or repelled  --  till the next morning , when I was horrorstruck . And then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " said Dolly . Martha shook her head . " No . The next week . I thought it was all over and I could forget about it  --  treat it as an aberration . But then he turned up again , at the theater , and the same thing happened again , in practicallyevery detail . . . . " Dolly scratched her head . " You must have been attracted to him , " she concluded . " But I was n't , " said Martha . " I had a man I was attracted to , more than one , in fact . " She shrugged and took anothermuffin . " It was an awful mistake to come back here , " she continued . " Do n't tell John I said so ; he does n't like to hear it . He knows it too but he wo n't say so . I ca n't tell him what I feel any more . He wants us to be brave and indifferent . " " But why not ? " said Dolly . " Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " acknowledged Martha , sighing . " But he does . I ca n't help it . He casts a long shadow . I do n't want to live in it . I feel depreciatedby him , like a worm , like a white grub in the ground . " She jumped up and began to gesture with the muffin , conscious of acting a part ; yet what she said wasp113quite true . Again , as with John , she found that she could not be herself and describe the feelings Miles aroused in her . " I do n't understand , " said Dolly . Martha nodded ; communication seemed hopeless . " Look , Dolly , " she said . " Between Miles and me , there 's a permanent war of principle . He claims to know what I am , to interpret me according to his authorized version ; I 'm sure he pretends to know why John and I came back here and why we married and what we get out of each other , ' as he 'd put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ; thanks to my experience , I have the lowdown ' on Miles . Two claims like this ca n't exist side by side , in balance . One has to crush the other . And I 'm the one to be crushed , inevitably . " She waved the muffin . " Why do you think that ? " murmuredDolly , knitting her brows . " Because I doubt , " said Martha , rather grandly . " It occurs to me that I may be wrong . Miles has never had that experience . " Dolly inclined her head . " I see what you mean , " she said , thoughtfully . " Meeting him the other day . . . . Martha 's face brightened . " You thought he was awful ? " she demanded , sitting down with a thump . " Yes , " said Dolly , in decided tones . " In what way ? " pressed Martha . " So heavy , " said Dolly . " Like a stone-crusher . He made me nervous too . He reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You want people to dislike him ? " asked Dolly . " Of course , " said Martha . " I rejoice in it . What did you think of her ? " Dolly screwed up her forehead . " Rather nice , I thought , really . Very sweet face . Attractive in her way . " Martha bit her lip . " More so than I am ? " But before Dolly could answer , Martha withdrew the question . " No , " she said . " Do n't tell me . I do n't want to hear , either way . Why should I care if she 's attractive ? " " You 're jealous , " said Dolly , with a troubled countenance . " I must be , " ad/mitted Martha . " But not in the way you would think . I stayed awake all last night , examining my conscience . I ca n't bear to have such feelings . They 're unworthy . And I have no right to them . It is n't as if I wanted him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , if he started after me again . That 's what I keep telling myself . " She closed her eyes and sat leaning back on the canvas-covered couch , looking all at once very pale and exhausted . " I always told him , " she said , slowly , " that he ought to let me leave him , for his own sake . I thought I meant it . I thought I had enough generosity to want him to be happy , apart from me . " She took a deep breath and set her lips . There was a silence while Martha brooded and Dolly watched her affectionately . " Do n't tell me if you do n't feel like it , " she murmured . It frightened her a little to see Martha like this , a waxen effigy of resolute misery ; she had always considered her a gay , resilient person . Martha made a grimace . " I 'll try , " she said . " In a minute . " She closed her eyes again and reflected . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell Miles . It would be best for both of them , if he would let her go . " You 're the one I want , " Miles alwaysretorted , comfortably . " No , " she would answer , resting her head on his arm , in the big bed ( this would be one of their " good " mornings , when Miles was on the wagon ) ; another woman , in her place , she said , would submit to his moods and make him happy . But though she allowedfor this contingency in theory , she really did not think it likely . A saint , she meant , would put up with him . Hence it had greatly dismayed her , the other day at the Goes ' , to see that this hypothetical other woman actuallyexisted , smiling and tender , obeying him gratefully , murmuring , " Yes , dearest , " when he gave the signp115to go . The notion that Miles could be " dearest " to anyonestruck Martha as preposterous . It was still more fantasticto hear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait . Such abnegation seemed to Martha unnatural and almost wicked . She could not , as she said to John , get over it . Yet it had a certain ring of familiarity . That , she declared with a sigh , was exactly the crazy kind of thing Miles tried to exact from a woman who wanted to live with him in peace . There was method in his madness ; he made his wives choose between him and common sense , between him and ordinarydecency . He made his wives his accomplices ; that was why they could not escape him . They had to stand by and watch him abuse the servants , hold back their wages , eat their food , accuse them of robbing him . He insisted that his wives lie for him , to his creditors , to the insurance company , to the tax people . He had no sense of limit or of other people 's rights . Nothing was safe from his meanderingappetites : the maid 's time off , her dinner , her birthday box of candy , the cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commandeered every bathroom . He even , Martha remembered , used to eat Barrett'slollipops . There was method in it , Martha had reiterated , to John , only last night : mere lack of consideration could not have carried him so far . His outrageousness had a purpose ; by a campaign of calculated " frightfulness " he broke his wives ' spirits . She herself could never live down , in her own mind , not what he had done to her , but what she had consented in  --  their treatment of her brother , the beatings he used to give Barrett . It was his child , she used to tell herself ; she could not interfere every time ; it would only goad Miles on , etc. , etc . These arguments were sound ; she was justified ; she had donep116her utmost . There was only one thing  --  a thing she had never quite brought herself to confess to John . Hearing Barrett cry , she had sometimes experienced pleasure . For an instant , before she could stop herself by pressing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing himself in his true colors to his son . And , to be honest , she often felt something of the same kind when he ate the servants ' food . If she had not felt this , she might have managed him better . She had seen this suddenly last night , in bed , clear as a vision or an unexpected refraction of her face from a street mirror . Miles had been right . It had satisfiedher , in some part of her soul , whenever he behaved badly to herself or anyone else . It had proved , so to speak , a point . " You see ? " she had felt like exclaiming , to Barrett , to the servants , to her doubting self . " That 's the way he is ! " Martha was too fair-minded to incite him to any of his crimes , and indeed she had done her best to protect other people from him and to cover up his traces , so that the world would not know . But if despite all her efforts he demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content and nodded to itself , as though a prediction had been verified . He would not let her love him , she used to tell herself , in gloomy triumph ; he would not let anybody love him , including his own child . Now it dashed her to recognize that somebody else had succeeded in doing what she had always defined as the impossible . " She loves him , " she had said aloud to herself , wonderingly , sitting up in bed and feeling a strange pang of jealousy . Her own love , beside this , seemed a paltry , commonplacething  --  why should she not love John ? It took no special virtue ; he was a lovable person . She had turned on the light softly and looked down at him , a coil of limbs in the bed ; he slept like a child , his lashes quiveringp117gently on his cheek , his curly hair disarrayed picturesquely . He was beautiful and good , and yet as she looked down on him , curiously , she had a hollow sense , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity of loving against the grain . " I 'm envious of their marriage , is n't that ridiculous ? " she said to Dolly , now , with a light , forced laugh and a grimace . " I ca n't bear the idea that anybody might think that it was happier than mine . " Dolly poked the dying fire . The pine wood was green ; Martha and John had told her that she ought to have locust . She felt a little shocked , as usual , by Martha and wondered whether Martha was different from herself or simply more honest  --  a question Martha had often provoked among her college circle . " You mean , " said Dolly thoughtfully , trying to understand , " that if he 's happy , it casts a reflection on you ? " Martha nodded . " But why should it , Martha ? " pleaded Dolly . " You were n't the right person for him . " Martha laughed . " Dear Dolly , " she said , " you sound so sensible . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a paragon uniting all the virtues . You remember that speech of Iago 's about Cassio ? ' He hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly . ' Well , I feel that in reverse . I 'd like to say to Miles : I have a daily beauty in my life that makes yours ugly . ' In fact , I 'd like to say it to every single person here in New Leeds , except you . All these tawdry people . That 's why we came back here  --  to show them how tawdry they are in comparison to us . " " Why , Martha , that 's horrible , " said Dolly , with her hand to her cheek . " I told you , " said Martha . " No wonder I feel like a worm . I hate this in myself and I ca n't cast it out . And once I 've discovered it I find it everywhere  --  all over me , even in my best actions . I suddenly feel that that 's why John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world how to do it right , a sort of star turn , calculated to excite envy . " " I do n't believe it , " said Dolly , resolutely , shaking her head . " I know you both better than that . John was always a bit of a show-off , in his reserved way , and so were you , Martha . But you both admire lots of people  --  your friends . I 've heard you . You 're both tremendous enthusiasts . " Marthareflected . " Yes , " she said . " You 're right . In a way . I always prided myself "  --  she laughed  --  " on the notion that I knew when to be humble . It must be this place that 's brought out the latent worst in me . Because of Miles . I feel I 'm living in a showcase . Everybody is lookingup to Digby and making comparisons . Or is it my imagination ? It seems to me that it 's inevitable , that the human mind , given two similars , weighs them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly inclined her head . " I see , " she murmured . " But ca n't you stop thinking about it ? " Martha lifted a shoulder . " You might as well tell me to stop thinking about myself . I ca n't . If I think about him or her , I think about myself . If I think about myself , they pop into my mind . It 's degrading . Do you think about yourself a lot , Dolly ? " " Constantly , " smiled Dolly . " In terms of reprimand . " " I know , " said Martha . " I wonder if these other people do . I ca n't make out . If they did , you 'd presume they 'd make some effort to improve their messy lives . So probably they do n't . I like your shells , " she added , examining an arrangement of graduated seashells that Dolly had picked up on the beach . " You did it for pleasure , I imagine . If it were I , I would do it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up . " And the irony is , Dolly , that nobody here cares . They do n't know the difference . All my silly efforts are wasted on them . You should have seen the vicomte yesterday : the soul of phlegm . And Ip119was hurt . Imagine . I wanted him to like our furniture . " " Why should n't he ? " said Dolly indignantly . Martha laughed . " I love you , Dolly , " she murmured . " You 're so loyal . " She hesitated . " Thank you for coming up here , " she said quickly . " I know you did it for us . Forgive us for bullying you . " " All my friends bully me , " said Dolly cheerfully . " Anyway , Martha , I admire you . You do n't have to force me to , either of you . But you do make me feel inferior . You always have . When you 're here , I burn the muffins . " She pointed with the fork to the charred remains on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't will that to happen , " she said . " Honestly . I 'd much rather you did n't burn them . I love perfection in my friends . I do n't grudge you the seashells or havinga better character than I have . It makes me happy . " She pondered . " Is n't there such a thing , any more , as a healthy rivalry , a noble emulation , like the Olympic Games or a contest of bards ? Does it all have to be poisoned , nowadays ? This horrible bohemian life you see up here , with lily cups and beards and plastics  --  it 's real leveling , worse than suburbia , where there 's a frank competition with your neighbors , to have the newest car or bake the best cakes . I can understand that . I 'm like that myself . But here nobody competes , unless there 's a secret contest as to who can have the most squalid house and give the worst parties . It gives me the strangestfeeling , as if I were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excel , as if I were competing , all alone , on an empty stage , without judges or rivals , just myself  --  asolipsistic nightmare . That way lies madness , ' as old Dr. Hendricks used to say , remember , in freshmanphilosophy . In Juneau , Dolly , there used to be a madwoman who rode up and down the streets on a bicycle , wearing a sort of circus costume , tights and a red jacket , and white paint and rouge . I feel just likep120her when I walk down the main street here , in a dress and stockings ; everybody stares  --  I 'm anti-social . The other day , in the First National , one of the local beldamesactually plucked at my arm and asked me why I wore stockings . ' Nobody does up here , ' she informed me . " " You always were a rebel , " said Dolly . " You 'd be the same if you lived in Scarsdale . " " No , " said Martha . " If I lived in Scarsdale , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to reform them . " " You want to reform these people ? " asked Dolly , with a quizzical smile . Martha nodded . " Of course . I 'm trying to set an example . It 's not only vanity ; there 's also a corrective impulse . ' Let your light so shine before all men . ' That 's the very height of my folly . John and I are making ourselves ludicrous with our high-toned ways . I know it but I wo n't desist . It becomes a form of fanaticism . They can kill me , I say to myself , grandly , but they ca n't make me be like them . " Dolly remained seated on her stool by the fireplace , watching Martha arrange her gray cloak . " You wo n't believe it , " said Martha , " but I do n't want to have a selfish life . I hate this obsession with myself , these odious comparisons . I want to live for somebody else , for ' humanity . ' " She gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Dolly . Martha frowned . " That 's just the trouble , " she said . " He wo n't let me live for him . He wants to live for me . It leaves us at a peculiar deadlock . I keep telling myself that if we could only have a baby , everything would be changed . I felt certain that when we came up here , I would ' conceive , ' " The habit of speaking in quotation marks was one the two young women had acquired in college ; Martha had trained herself out of it , professionally , but when she was with Dolly the mannerism reasserted itself.  | " Maybe you will , Martha . " Martha shook her head . " I 'm thirty-three . A little too old really , for a first baby . And years ago I had an abortion . It may have done something to my insides . Anyway , it 's probably wrong to have a baby as a solution . ' One ought to have it for no reason , just for itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingered . " Come to dinner tomorrow . I 'll cook something vainglorious for you . Maybe we 'll go mushrooming first . John has found a new kind . And we have some beautiful poisonous ones , waxy yellows and exotic carmines , that we thought you might like to paint . The poisonous ones , naturally , are the prettiest . " She was speaking , all at once , very rapidly , in a disjointed manner . Dolly looked at her wonderingly . " Thank you for the tea , " added Martha . " Thank you for the tarragon , " said Dolly , slowly getting up . " I really must go , " said Martha , still not moving . " John will worry . That 's the disadvantage of your not having a telephone . Dolly , are you lonely here ? " " I like it , " said Dolly . The two young women 's eyes slowly canvassed each other . " One more thing , " said Martha , hurriedly , in an offhand tone but holding her friend 's gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night that the reason I wanted one was because of them . " Dolly dropped her eyes . " You mean the Murphys , " she muttered , staring at the floor . Martha nodded . " They have a baby . I want a better one . It stands to reason . I never thought seriously of having one till we came up here . " Dolly 's figure stiffened , as though a pain had shot through it , as she listened to this abrupt confession . " You must n't say that , " she admonished . " I know , " gravely agreed Martha . " If I ever should have a baby , you must promise to forget that I told you . It may not even be true . " She tossed the last phrase off lightly and stood onp122tiptoe to give Dolly a kiss . Dolly received the kiss absentlyand remained where she was , leaning slightly forward , like a pillar , as she heard the door shut and Martha 's quick , lively step crackle the twigs in the path outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pond sent the sound back , a distant airy cadenza . Dolly drew her thumb slowly across her jaw . She frowned . Her neat dish face wore a mazed look of consternation . She shook herself , dog style , and went , still frowning , to pick up the tea things . " You must not be shocked , " she said to herself aloud , in stern bell tones , as she headed toward the little kitchen.  |p123YOU  MUST N'T be shocked by anything . That 's thefirst lesson for the artist , " said Sandy Gray , seriously . He was a tall Australian with a brownbeard who had formerly been an art critic on an Englishmagazine . He was wearing a black wool shirt , blackdungarees , and black wading boots and was knockingout a black pipe on Dolly Lamb 's table . It was midmorning . Dolly had been painting , on the ridge outsideher house , when she saw a strange man striding throughthe pond toward her , cutting down the pickerel weedwith a hunting knife as he went . She shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , whilemaking straight for the spot where she was standing  --  likea guided missile , she fancied . A mild , half-humorousfear crinkled her forehead . She was readily dismayed bythe most ordinary encounters ; everything for her wasnuminous  --  the butcher with his cleaver , the hunterin the woods . Her virgin heart feared the Angel Gabrielin the milkman , bumping along the road in his truck , and did not dare refuse the milk , cream , eggs , and butterhe offered her , far beyond her small wants . Behold thehandmaiden of the Lord  --  she lived meekly in the age offable , amid powers that had to be propitiated . Theintruder today , in a black visored cap , swashing throughthe pond , advanced on her like a superman from acomic book or the man from the telephone company ; in either case , the same perplexity presented itself : whop124was to speak first ? " Hello , " she called out bravely , when he was twenty feet away . " Hi , " he retorted and flailed his way up the slope to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear . He then walked into the house in his wet boots , followed by Dolly . " I 'm Sandy Gray , " he stated , in a voice that took her aback by its softness . " Have you got a cup of coffee ? " " Only instant , " confessed Dolly . " That 'll do , " he answered . " Fix us a couple of cups . " Out in the kitchen , as she put on the water to boil and measured out the coffee , she could see him , hunched on her studio couch , reading her copy of Art News , his black cap pulled down and his hunting knife stuck in his belt . Dolly was perturbed . Apprehension had told her who he was even before he had introduced himself : a typical backwoods blowhard , according to John Sinnott ; a horrible boor , said Martha . He was a former Communist , it seemed , who made sandals in the summertime , for the tourist trade , and rode a motorcycle and used to feed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till the S.P.C.C. stepped in . On no account , warned Martha , was Dolly to give him any encouragement , if he dropped by to call on her . His fourth wife had just left him , and he was on the prowl again . He would want to be neighborly and to advise her about her painting , but he was only after liquor and somebody to cook his meals for him . He did not need any encouragement , Dolly inwardly cried . He seemed so at home that it was she who felt like the interloper . When he had finished his coffee , he took his cap off , tossed it on the couch , and walked up and down her small living room , his thumbs stuck in his belt , examining her effects just as if he were alone in the house . He opened and closed the door to her bedroom , glanced up the chimney flue , picked up a picture post/card and scanned the message on the back of it . He stood for a long time staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riffled through it , and replaced it , upside down . During this inspection , not a word was spoken . Dolly 's soul was outraged , but her tongue refused to move . She did not know how to forbid him the extraordinary liberties he was taking . He behaved like a higher authority with a warrant to search out evidence of her personal tendency . As she sat , meekly watching , a thread of silvery humor wove in and out of her thoughts , tracing a delicate embroidery . At the same time , suspensebegan to mount in her ; her heart beat faster under her pale-blue shirtwaist and golden chamois jacket . She could not escape the thought that he was here to pronouncea judgment . On the driftwood table , by the window , there was a bowl of poisonous mushrooms , brought her by the Sinnotts , which she had set up to paint . He bent down to smell them and made a noise of disgust . " Corrupt and dainty , " he said , in his soft , breathy voice . " Throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could protest , from her footstool by the fireplace , he had taken the dish from the table , opened the screen door , and flung the deadly mushrooms out into the pinewoods . " Damn you ! " cried Dolly , jumping up indignantly . " You 've just ruined my still life . " She confronted him , quivering , her arms akimbo , while he watched her , unperturbed , from his greater height . In a minute Dolly fell back , discountenancedby the grave look of his deep-set eyes , which swept back and forth , slowly , across her face , like two searchlightsset in the bushy camouflage of hair and beard and brows . Having lost her temper and sworn at him , she found herself mysteriously translated onto a plane of intimacy , and she listened , a little bemused , as he proceeded to give her a lecture on decadence , with illustra/tions drawn from what he had found in her dwelling . The fact that he claimed to " know " her without even knowing her name imparted a sort of dreamlike solemnityto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her like some meddlesome old prophet twitching the sleeve of a busy monarch with a message from on high . " Stop hoarding , " he said gently , pointing to her collection of seashells and to the starfish arranged in a graduatedseries on her mantelpiece . " It 's your own shit you 're assembling there , in neat , constipated little packages . " Dolly 's cheeks suddenly flamed . She was as a matter offact given to constipation and she felt as if he had peeked into her medicine-cabinet and found the bottle of Nujol . Moreover , she detested coarse language . The British , she told herself dutifully , were less nice in their speech than the Americans . But even as she strove not to mind , not to be insular and puritanical , tears sprang to her eyes , and she had to wipe them away hastily on the sleeve of her jacket . " Are you shocked ? " he asked with a face of polite inquiry . When Dolly nodded mutely , he stood pulling his beard and frowning . She expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she found that now , contrarily , as always seemed to happen , she wanted him to stay . " You 're angry with me , " she venturedin a small voice . He shook his head . " I try to be honest , " he explained , " and I hurt people , like an abrasive . I want to sand them down to their essentials , scrape off the veneers . When I saw your picture , out there , I knew I had something to tell you . " " You liked it ? " she said wonderingly . " No . I hated it . It made me want to spew . " Her work was sick , he told her  --  cramped with preciosity and mannerisms . Underneath , he discerned talent , but it was crippled , like some poor tree tortured out of shape by a formal gardener . She needed to be bolder and freer.  |p127Dolly  frowned . She had heard this from every one of her teachers and she supposed that it must be true . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital force imprisoned inside her that was crying to be let out . How did they know , she used to mutter to herself in secret outrage . If there was anybody else inside her  --  as far as she could testify  --  it was a creature still more daunted and mild and primly scrupulous than the one the world saw . For years , she had been trying obediently to be bold and free in her work , and the results had always been discouraging , even to her counselors . When she " let herself go , " her paintings got big and mechanical ; she painted drearily , in the style of the teacher who had advised her to be herself . She was tired , moreover , of being told she had talent . She had come to feel that it was like a disease that she toted from doctor to doctor , seeking a new opinion , a new treatment . Her last teacher , whom she had stayed with a year , had been a neo-romantic ; before that , she had had an intra-subjectivistand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the same story . Each began , enthusiastically , by undoing the errors of his predecessor . That was the easy part , but what came next , supposedly  --  the leap forward , the breakthrough  --  never was accomplished . She parted from each master sadly , with the knowledge that she had disappointedhim . Perhaps it was her money , Martha had lightly observed ; perhaps she was like the rich young man in the Bible , who could not accomplish his breakthroughunless he sold all he had and gave to the poor . . . . Dolly resented this suggestion ; she had been thinking about it in the last few days , pacing up and down the wooded path with her hands dug in her pockets . Everybody , she felt , had been trying to change her , to take something away from her . For the first time , all alone here , with her teeth gritted , she had dared thinkp128that it was she who had the right to be disappointed . In the silence of her house , her heart murmured against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her down . As she listened to Mr. Sandy Gray , echoing the familiarcavils , this resentment suddenly exploded . " But I am precious , " she exclaimed , leaning forward on the footstooland striking a blow on her chest . " I 'm inhibited . I 'm afraid of life . I 'm decadent . That is me . Why ca n't I paint that if I want to ? " Sandy Gray smiled . " You ca n't paint a negation , " he said . Dolly clenched her fists . " What about Bosch ? " she demanded , seizing the name arbitrarily as a standard to rally to . " Bosh , my dear girl , " he answered . " You know better than that . Horror is n't a negation . Only fear . You must n't be afraid . " Dolly sighed . She could not tell him the truth : that every moment of her life was shot through with terrors ; peril stirred all around her , whimsically , in the rustling of the trees , in the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank . This was what she was straining to show in her painting : the absurd powers that were bending her to their will  --  nature as animate and threateningand people as elemental forces . But what her critics saw in her small canvases was only " meticulous craftsmanship , " " timid conceits , " " quaint charm . " If they did not urge her to break through , they advised her to illustrate children 's books . " Are you afraid of me ? " Sandy Gray queried . Dolly considered and then shook her head , smiling . Strangely enough , she was not ; she was only afraid of what the Sinnotts would think of her for letting him stay so long . He was so much like one of her bogeys that she could deprecate his terrors . He had come out of the pond just like a myth , she said to herself with amusement . She wasp129far more fearful of what she called normal people : John and Martha , for instance . Even if they had not told her , she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow their sharp eyes , alas , as easily as she could have put on Martha 's severe , horn-rimmed reading glasses . ' 1'o the normal vision , Sandy Gray was just another rusticated bohemian , solemn and loquacious and self-vaunting , a not-very-intelligent and pretentious bore . And yet , to Dolly 's eyes , there was something Christlike about his appearance . His hair and beard were a soft , delicate brown . His skin was white , and he had deep-set , lightbrowneyes with strange bluish whites . He carried himselfstiffly , almost as if he had a spinal injury , and his long arms were frail . The black shirt and jeans and boots and gruff manners were deliberately misleading . He was really a gentle person . As soon as she had said this to herself , Dolly felt a defiant quiver of pleasure . She had two kinds of friends : those she described to herself as " gentle " and the others . The second kind was always criticizing the first kind and saying they were unworthy of her . The more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . Her aunts , who themselves were oddities in the New England manufacturingtown she came from ( one of them smoked cigars and was deaf and enormously fat ) , always used to complain that she had odd , unsuitable friends . They would never let her choose her pets either , and all her life Dolly had felt herself in the position of a little girl in a big house stealing out to give a saucer of milk to a stray cat , which , as her aunts used to warn her , was probablydiseased . She had loved her aunts ; she loved John and Martha and all the other sensible , sharp-spoken people who had succeeded to her aunts ' place in knowingp130what was right for her  --  her trustees , her teachers , and their European-born wives , who fixed her hair for her and put mascara on her quivering lashes , before an art opening , and told her when to let her hems down and how to walk into a room . These rational guardians of her interestswere all somewhat alike ; the world admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " friends were all different , resembling each other only in the stubborn quaintness of choice that had selected them . She had the queerest collection , picked up on her travels , priests and nuns , elderly doctors with tropical diseases , destitute baronesses , progressive high-school principals , housewives , young soldiers , broken-down artistes ; many of her friends were children . A psychiatrist once told her that she was afraid of being overrun by strong people and sought out weak ones , whom she could protect . This was not quite exact , Dolly herself recognized . Everybody wanted to tyrannize over her , the weak far more insistently , she had to admit , than the strong , who sometimes had other things to think about than telling her what to do . She was taken in too easily , her trustees said , examiningher check stubs . But that was not the case . She knew very well when she was being exploited by the kind of person she called gentle , and she claimed the right to be exploited , hugging it to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Down deep , in the bedrock of her soul , there was a mistrustfulness of good sense . Behindevery caution , she suspected a deprivation ; something was being withheld . The demand to see for herself , ever since her thirtieth birthday , had been developing into a secret mania ; she wanted to live . Outwardly , she was just the same , quiet and decorous , but in her soul she pioneered obstinately , inverting every notion that was offered her , especially where people were concerned . Much as she loved John and Martha , whenever she wasp131with them she had to fight off the suspicion that her judgmentwas being constrained . The first night she had arrived here , they had had her to dinner and put her to bed afterward , in their guest bedroom , despite her insistence that she wanted to sleep in her own house . The water was not turned on yet , John pointed out , and the house would be damp and cold from having been shut since Labor Day . In the morning , he would settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Martha were extraordinarily helpful ; they loved preparations and bustle and giving advice . After dinner , in their parlor John had handed Dolly a list of all the people she might need : the plumber , the electrician , the laundress , the odd-job man , the woman who would clean , if Dolly wanted her . Her garbage , he said , she would do best to take to the dump , and , for one person , it was wiser not to have the milkman ; better buy milk when she needed it from the store . Between them , they had thought of everything . They told her the best places to swim at this time of year and where to get the freshest eggs . John drew a map , showing where mussels were to be found , on the old pier , and where you could dig clams and collect oysters ; he marked some painting sites on it in red pencil , with stars . Martha made him show where the Indian pipe grew and where a file of cigar-colored boletusmarched down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did everything , Dolly felt , but paint the pictures for her , so eager were they to be useful and anticipate her needs . It was a sign of love , and she knew it ; moreover , it was a sign of intelligence . She was pleased ( or had been , until today ) with the painting ideas they had given her , which suited her painstaking brush . The frail Indian pipes , gray-white shading into pink , with a delicate black fringe on the petals , like a **25;8443;TOOLONG , had turned out awfully well ; the boletus picture was not finished , but the conception was splendid . And John had done everything for her , without being asked . He had come to put back the screens when the late mosquitoes bothered her and he had dug her a garbagepit when he saw that she did not like to take the can to the dump , which had a horrible smell and rats and human scavengers , eagerly picking over the refuse . He chopped some pine wood for her and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come , with extra pots and pans and dishes . She had brought Dolly a cook book with the best recipes marked . And she always knew the best ; that , to Dolly was the worst of it . If Dolly followed instructions , everything came out right ; and if she tried a different recipe from the one recommended by Martha , the result was a disaster . The Sinnotts always knew ; it was an instinct with them . And they never compromised or pretended that anything was other than it was . This quality had never failed to amaze Dolly , in all the years she had known them  --  their sense of life 's topography . Everything in New Leeds was where they said it was and looked precisely as they had described it , the good and the bad , the wilted lettuces and withering carrots in the grocery-store bins , the sunset from Long Hill . When Dolly , hopefully , would find that they had been wrong in some particular , it would turn out that she had not followed the directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day in Hell  --  Dolly felt certain  --  he could conduct a guided tour of all the circles , walking ahead with his long , bounding step , commenting on the architecture and pointing out the denizens whom it would be worth while to meet . This trait , to Dolly , was both wonderful and terrible . It was the distillation of all she feared and mistrusted , admired and envied . John and Martha were like parentsp133to her , though they all three were nearly the same age . They could not help thinking for her ( no one could , apparently ) , and if she let them , everything sparkled with high spirits and certainty . In these bright October days , they were living , the three of them , in a sort of idyl , full of games and laughter . They made a charming picture  --  Dolly had studied it , as though in a mirror or in the still glass of one of the roseate ponds : the dark young man and the two fair-haired girls . In the mornings , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , while Martha wrote and Dolly painted , on a schedule he had devised . Nearly every afternoon , they met for a swim or to go musseling or mushrooming . On especially good days , they picnicked on the beach , with a hamper of fried chicken and a cranberry pie . They often had dinner together , cooking over Dolly 's fire or eating , more formally , in Martha 's pink dining room . They read poetry and argued heatedly about books and pictures ; Martha spun theories out of John 's and Dolly 's perceptions . Late at night , armed with a star book and a flashlight , they went out to have Dolly identify the stars for them . There was the promise of a French play-readingat the Coes ' , about which the Sinnotts appeared to be squabbling . John did not want them to go , and Martha protested that it would be unkind not to . She had already cast Dolly in the role of the queen , Berenice , and was sketchingout a costume for her , though there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these arguments between the Sinnotts , quick and laughing as they were . In the ten days she had been here , she had become aware of a change in their relation . She could see , behind the screen of persiflage , that John was worried about money and that Martha 's play was not going well . Several times it had been on the tip of her tongue to offer them a loan ,  |p134but  the fear of intruding kept her silent . They were going , she sensed , through a period of testing , in which no outsider , even a second cousin , could help . Dolly often wondered , especially since Martha 's visit , whether it had not been a mistake on their part to try themselves out here , of all places , where there were so many bad memories for Martha to live down . But it was precisely like the Sinnotts to seek out the severest conditions . They would not compromise , Dolly knew , any more than they would drink instant coffee ; they demanded the supreme test . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was her own she questioned as she lay awake at night in her bunk-bed , listening to animals that John assured her were only squirrels . Influenced perhaps by their example , she too felt that she had reached a point of decision . But her own little bark was not even launched yet on the unknown waters that beckoned her , while John and Martha were already at sea , having chosen to sink or swim . It was an awful choice ; Dolly could see why they were scared , even though , for once , she thought she knew better than they did and could promise them that it would be all right for them in the end . But they would not believe her if she told them . " You only see the surface , " Martha had said once , gloomily , when they had all had a lot of red wine at dinner and Dolly had been telling them what a beautiful life they had made here . " Are you different when you 're alone ? " Dolly had asked in alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , but it was not that . It was something else , said Martha . " All this , " she declared , with a sweeping gesture that took in her long , shadowed dining room . " We made it , but I ca n't believe that it 's real . " She did not want Dolly to stay on here . Only tillp135Thanksgiving , she told Dolly firmly . After that , Dolly would not like it . The winds would begin to blow and it would be too unpleasant to go sketching and the people would get on her nerves . But it was just here that Dolly disagreed with her . Despite what Martha said , she felt determined to extend her stay through the winter . She did not want only the " best part , " as Martha called the fall season ; she wanted the whole thing . And it distressed her to be told , repeatedly , by both John and Martha that it would be fatal for her to get to know the people here . She had heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when her head was swimming with the information that was being pressed on her . Sandy Gray 's name , she ruefully remembered , had led the list of persons especially to be avoided , if , as Martha said , she had come down here to work . That was the point , both the Sinnottshad averred , talking very fast and underscoring each other 's words . If you came here to work , there were only a few people you could safely see : the Coes , a couple called the Hubers , who were much older , and one or two others whose names Dolly could not remember . The rest were death , said Martha , stamping out a cigarette . " But why ? " Dolly had murmured , sleepy and confused . " They do n't work , " said the Sinnotts , with an air of having explained the universe . Dolly did not understand . There were lots of nice people who did n't work , she protested , feeling a wayward loyalty spring up towardthis criticized group . The Sinnotts shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained : they had turned New Leeds into a hive of inactivity . They not only did not work but they proselytized for sloth . They had even converted the natives . " Do you know , " cried John , " what the carpenter told me the other day when I called him in to look at some sills ? He said , Believe it or not , we try to do a good job . ' " Dollyp136laughed dubiously ; she could see that the Sinnotts were very much excited . These people here , they continued , had no object in life except to see each other incessantly , over a bottle . They did not read ; they did not travel , farther than Digby or to Trowbridge , the county seat , when one of them was arrested for drunken driving or had to appear in a divorce case . They did not even keep house or take care of their children any longer . Their wants were reduced to a minimum  --  shelter , something to eat , blue jeans and a Mackinaw , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , said Martha  --  a planner 's nightmare of what the world would be like when work had been abolished and everybody took a vitamin pill instead of bothering to cook . " But why should n't they live like that if they want to ? " Dolly had been saying to herself , over and over again , in a plaintive voice , alone in her shack , as she answered the Sinnotts on behalf of these New Leedsians whom she had never been permitted to meet . " Why should they work if they do n't have to ? " She herself was industrious , even in her pleasures , like a sober little girl making mud pies , but it seemed to her that it was unfair of the Sinnotts to expect the rest of humanity to be like them . Moreover , she was curious , which was , she felt , her right as a woman . She was restive , living in an idyl , with two omniscient beings cautioning her not to open Pandora 's box , not to light Psyche 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she cried , jumping up , when Sandy Gray proposedthat she come for a walk in the woods with him . " Why should n't I if I want to ? " she said aloud , rubbingher pale curls thoughtfully , as if she were just wakingup . She let him lead her off up a hidden trail , leaving her easel where it was and her brushes unwiped . It was ap137wonderful walk . He knew the woods better than John and Martha ; he showed her foxholes and deer tracks and where a skunk had its den . They explored an old logging trail , very much overgrown . He helped her climb over trees that had been blown down by the last hurricane . Brambles tore her stockings and a hornet stung her , but he hurried down to a little stream and made a mud plaster to put on her cheek . They scaled a high ridge , goingcross-country , and found a place where you could look out and see seven ponds . Outdoors , he was a differentperson , courteously doing the honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always ready , at her elbow , to guide her up a steep spot when she needed it , and he looked the other way when she had to stop to take the stones out of her shoes . They talked about the difficulties of painting from nature , which was always changing just as you got your colors set , and about chess and the Great Barrier Reef . Just before lunch-time , they saw a fawn . " It looks like you , " he said , turning to scan her with a short , gusty laugh . " The startled fawn . " Dolly colored ; it was not the first time she had heard this allusion made . Nevertheless , she liked him , she said to herself , as she peered into the little mirror that was tacked up over the kitchen sink . She was a sight . There were burrs in her hair and her face was streaked with mud , but her cheeks were glowing . He was still there , in the living room , drinking a glass of white wine while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salami and tomatoes and cheese . He was telling her about his children , who had been handed over to his third wife by a court order when his fourth wife left him . He was suing to get them back . His lawyer was going to show that she was living with a French Canadian truckdriver , down on the bay front , in a house made of cement blocks , and using the maintenance money to buy her paramour presents.  | " Which one ? " called Dolly , slicing the salami . " You mean the fourth or the third ? " He meant the third , he said , but the fourth wife was here too , working at the counter of the grille . All his wives were here , except the second one ; the first was in the graveyard , up by the high school  --  a very fine woman , he observed , used to be a singer , older than he was , one of the pioneer artists to settle in New Leeds . For some reason , the dead woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , she did not dare ask what she had died of , lest she hear that she had burned up or fallen down a stairway . " What about the second one ? " she murmured , setting down the plate of bread and cheese before him and slipping into the place opposite . A dour expression darkened his face . " Ellen , " he said , slowly , munching a piece of bread . " You 've heard about Ellen ? " Dolly shook her head . " You must have , " he exclaimed . " Your friend Martha must have told you . " Dolly shook her head again . Fear tightened her throat ; it was the first time Martha had been mentioned between them , and there was something ugly , a sneer , in the way he pronounced her name . Yet why should he like Martha , she asked herself ; after all , Martha did not like him . " That beats all , " he remarked . " Why ? " said Dolly , faintly , after a silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thick as thieves . " " Oh ? " Dolly quavered , filling his glass with wine and pouring milk for herself . " I loved Ellen , " he said , chewing . " She was the only one I loved . " " But what happened ? " said Dolly . " She left me , " he retorted . " Seven years ago . " Dolly drew a quick breath . " Martha Murphy , " he said , " put her up to it . I have proof . I found the letters . I pieced them together from the wastepaper basket . " " Letters ? " " From Martha to Ellen  --  general delivery , " he said impatiently . " Urgingher to leave me , for her soul 's sake . Ellen was weak.  |p139She  did n't want to leave me . She did it because she was told she ought to . Everything Martha did , she copied . " Dolly bit her lip ; she could see the possibility of this all too clearly . On the other hand , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more he spoke of Ellen , who had been young and blond and beautiful and was disowned by her parents when she married him , the more Dolly felt that the marriage had been unsuitable . " Where is she now ? " she inquired , pushing a bowl of grapes toward him . " In Mexico . " She had gone through her own money , it seemed , and was living with a Mexicanon the alimony from her second husband . But Sandy Gray still loved her and still wanted her back . Now that he was between marriages , he had started writing to her again , and she had answered . . . . Dolly glanced at him thoughtfully from beneath loweredbrows . Here was a man , she perceived , who was livingon hope . Ellen , his children  --  he expected to get them all back at once and start a new life . He had no idea , apparently  --  shethought with pity  --  that anything was ever finished . He was still toying with the notion that he might have sued Martha for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also written letters . Miles Murphy had told him he should have done it when he went to him as a therapist . The word , therapist , prickled Dolly 's sensibilities . He had a number of jargon terms that embarrassed her and she did not care for his Americanisms , which sounded awfully queer in his Australian voice . And his table manners were disturbing . He talked earnestly , with his mouth full , and particles of food kept falling into his beard . All that was unimportant , she said to herself , watching him spit the grape seeds out onto his plate . He had a fearsome sinceritythat made good manners seem false . This sincerity appalled Dolly , for his sake . He wasp140living here in the woods like a mole in a tunnel . The outside did not exist for him , evidently . He was utterly free of self-consciousness  --  the consciousness , that is , of how he might look to others . It made Dolly feel guilty even to question his hopes , to peep at him through the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman , Ellen , whose snapshot he took out of his black breast pocket to show her . She held the snapshot at arm 's length , narrowing her eyes to appraise it in the light of his expectations . It was a pretty blond girl , thin , with a long bob and a pearl choker , wearing a sun dress . Dolly felt as if she knew her ; she had known the type in college  --  the strained , squirrelly debutantes who dropped out in the sophomore year to make a reckless marriage . She will never come back to you , she said to herself , remorsefulfor her percipience . " She 's lovely , " she said aloud , handing back the photograph . He nodded , stowingthe picture away with a little pat of satisfaction . He remained , musing , at the table , drawing on his pipe , while Dolly washed the dishes . He did not offer to help her , and she was grateful for this . There was not room for two in the little kitchen , Dolly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kept bumping into each other . She did not want to be at such close quarters , indoors , with Mr. Sandy Gray . In the house , his clothes gave off a slightly sour , musty smell , like that of an unaired closet . His fingernails were clean  --  shT. had looked to see  --  but she could not rid herself of the notion that his white soft skin was dirty , underneath his clothes , which she could not imagine ever going to the cleaners ' and coming back on hangers , like middle-class apparel . If he bathed at all , she conjectured , it must be in the pond . She could picture his long white form immersing itself naked , as if in a baptism , with a cake of Ivory soap . " Would you like a swim ? " His voice came suddenlyp141from the sitting room . Dolly started . More than once , she had had the uneasy feeling that he could read her thoughts . " No , thanks , " she answered , in a muffled voice . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinnotts had been surprised , the first afternoon , when she produced her gray wool bathing suit . " You do n't need that here , " said Martha , but John had been more tactful and left his underdrawers on , in the water , while Martha had swum nude . After that , they had both brought bathing suits , whenever they came , which Dolly felt was an imposition on them , for the whole point of New Leeds  --  she could hear Martha saying it  --  was that you could go in naked . " Good ! " came the voice from the sitting room . " Most people swim too much here . " Despite her relief , Dolly again was troubled ; she felt that her friends were being criticized . And what was wrong with swimming ? She dared not ask . " The natives never swim , " the voice answeredher silent inquiry . " It 's a city person 's fad , like cooking in the fireplace . " " Good Lord ! " said Dolly , raising a stricken hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for , originally ? " she ventured , hanging up the dish towel . " Hell , yes , " he said . " They did it from necessity . Now it 's phoney , an artifice . ' Oh , I adore these old fireplaces , ' " he quoted in falsetto . Dolly came reluctantly into the sitting room . Her fireplacewas not old , but her two wire broilers and an asbestosglove stood beside it , bearing witness against her . She could not make out whether he had seen them . And his point of view was mysterious to her ; she could not locate where he stood , with such an uncompromisingair . New Leeds , he declared , was being ruined by an influx of smart people with money and artificial standards . Dolly rubbed her eyes . Who did he mean , she asked herself wonderingly . The Sinnotts , if he meant them , had no money . And who else could answer to this de/scription ? She could only suppose that he must be referringto her . " Who ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled . " My dear girl , " he said . " You must have met them and been entertained in their homes . " Dolly shook her head . " I do n't know who you mean , " she said stubbornly . He puffed on his pipe . " The Goes , " he said finally . " The Hubers . " And he named off the very people whom Martha had said she could see . Dolly pressed her lips firmly together to stifle the laughterthat was bubbling up . " The Goes ! " she cried faintly . " You 're dreaming . " She started to add that she had been served a drink in a jelly glass in their establishment , but prudence closed her mouth just in time ; she did not want him to find her with an artificial standard showing . " The Goes are all right , " he conceded . " But they 're rich people and they want to set the tone . They 've formed a choice little group : your friend Martha , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Dolly laughed uncomfortably . " I thought you liked Mr. Murphy , " she protested . Sandy Gray nodded . " Miles was my friend , " he said somberly . " Now I do n't know him any more . Or he does n't know me . It 's this damned change . He 's got a new woman and he 's gone respectable . He drives around in a Cadillac , wearing a sports jacket . If I ask him to drop in to see me , he explains that his white-wall tires wo n't take these back roads or his wheels will get out of alignment . Or he 's busy with his philosophicalwork . There 's something slick and hard about the guy now that he 's got his life fixed up . First things first , ' I said to him the last time we met and he stared at me like a boiled lobster . " Dolly smiled bleakly at the comparison ; she felt touched and troubled by what she was hearing . " Perhaps he is busy , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day at the Coes ' weighed heavy on her conscience . " First thingsp143first , " Sandy Gray repeated . " Let me give you an example . I went down to see him last month , on my motorbike . I had the idea that I might get him to testily for me , professionally , as a psychologist , about the kids ' condition . Miles knows Clover , my third wife , from way back ; she grew up here ; her father wrote for the pulps . He knows she 's an unfit mother ; she used to take care of his kid for him when he was living with Martha . I figuredhe could drop in to see her now and report what he found to my lawyer . " Dolly 's brows furrowed ; a deep sense of horror overcame her ; her stomach felt queasy . Her sympathies , by instinct , flew to the mother 's side and repelled the idea of spying on her . But she immediatelyfelt rebuked by another inner voice that told her she was being conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than many mothers ; it was only tradition that shrank from the facts . Moreover , there was spying and spying ; in a good cause , she supposed , it was justified . " I told him the whole story , " Sandy Gray was relating . " And he sat there at his desk , in that damned windmill , listening , tapping his foot and doodlingon a piece of paper . " So what happened ? " said Dolly . " Did he refuse you ? " Sandy Gray snorted . " He never gave me the chance to ask him . He cut me short in the middle of a sentence . Well , well , ' he said , getting up and looking at his wrist watch , the way he used to do when the hour was over . Interesting case , Sandy . It will make a judgment of Solomon when it comes to the court in November . ' " Despite herself , Dolly laughed . " And that was all ? " she murmured , sobering her face . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to the door and rang a bell for his wife . " A silence fell . Dolly herself became conscious of the passage of time . She dared not look at her wrist watch ,  |p144but  the sun had left the windows and it must be , she realized , at least three o'clock . In an hour , the sun would set , and nothing was accomplished . She had not gone for the mail or bought her groceries ; her brushes and paints and easel were still outside . Yet she tried not to think of these things , which were mere details , she told herself . Her work , her life , her mind were cluttered with detail . " First things first , " she muttered under her breath , like a lesson . An hour ago , she had been on the edge of something  --  a straightforward relation with a man . And now suddenly it was spoiled , by her having , so to speak , underthoughts . The silence , as it continued , propagated trivia ; she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not wipe up because it would be conventional . The need to make conversation became an uncomfortable urgency , but she could think of nothing to say but something about the weather . Moreover , she was afraid that John and Martha might come . And on top of everything else , she had to go to the bathroom . She jumped up and lit a match to the fire laid in the fireplace . He turned to watch her , crouching at the hearth . " How old are you ? " he said abruptly . Dolly told him her age . " Are you a virgin ? " he demanded . Dolly 's spine stiffened ; she rose , slowly , and backed up against the fireplace wall . Nobody had asked her this question since she had been in college . She had often yearned to discuss what was the central fact in her life , but everybodysteered shy of it , even her closest friends . Yet now that she had been asked , finally , her tongue remained paralyzed . She stared at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Are you or are n't you ? " Dolly looked at him in anguish . " Do n't you know ? " he said , ironically . This , in literal fact , was the case . She had hadp145a single experience , five years before , on a boat , at night , on the deck , behind a stack of steamer chairs . A sailor had interrupted them , and she had fled in shame to her cabin , not sure whether or not the act , as the books said , had been completed . The next morning they had landed , and she had never seen her partner , a young student , again . Since that time , men had made love to her , and she had responded , even while resisting . But they got discouraged too easily ; they gave up , like her painting teachers , just when she might have let herself go . Several times , she had nearly made the plunge . She had permittedwhat her aunts used to call liberties and was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed and struggled , when the man , straightening his necktie , would get up and say he was sorry . " Do n't be sorry , " she had several times cried out , but they took this as mere courtesy on her part . The older she got , the more men hesitated to tamper with her , because they thought she was a virgin , and she could not correct this impression , because she was not sure . As she stood gazing at Sandy Gray , she felt the gates of her speech miraculously unlocking . She was going to tell ; his wish to know was impersonal . After all , she reminded herself , he was in love with another woman . Recklessly , she opened her mouth and took a deep breath , but at that moment he got up and yawned , stretching his long arms . " All right , " he said . " I 'm sorry . Do n't tell me . " He picked up his cap from the studio couch . " But I 'll tell you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been in love . " Dolly 's rueful gaze rested , startled , on him . It was true , but how did he know it ? Her stubborn nature had known many passionate attachments  --  to animals , to her teachers , to her friends . But she had never loved a man , in the sense that he meant , except in daydreams . " Howp146do you know ? " she said . He shrugged . " I see it everywhere , " he replied , gesturing with his cap . " In your work . In the way you stand , backed up against the wall . In your books . Noli me tangere . " Tears came to Dolly 's eyes for the second time that day . " Do n't cry , " he said . " I like you . You 're a good little child in your pinafore . You love Mummy and Daddy and Nanny and little brother and sister and your teddy bear . Some day you may grow up to be a woman . " He put on his cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I live on the other side of the pond , behind that pine grove . " Dolly stood watching him go , the way he had come , striking with his knife at the pickerel weed . She felt shattered . A long-sought opportunity had been missed . Another time , if she saw him , everything would be different : she would know him too well to speak openly . It was because he had come to her as a stranger , out of the pond , like a water god , that she had nearly confessed herself . She was tempted to run after him , but another feeling , a sense of proud umbrage , held her where she was . He was wrong about her , she said to herselftriumphantly . He had missed the point altogether . She had no Mummy or Daddy or brother or sister . She was an orphan . He was stupid not to have seen that . And John and Martha were right . Thanks to him , she had lost a day 's painting . Perplexity smote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . " Oh damn , " she cried . " Damn , damn , damn ! "  |p147IT  WAS Friday morning . Jane Coe had set the alarm clock for eight , so that she would be sure to get hold of the electrician before he went off for the day . The icebox had been on the blink since Tuesday , and every morning she had missed him . It was no good leaving messageswith his wife , to give him at lunch-time , for he was a lazy loafer who hated to come all the way out the back roads to the Coes ' house and risk getting stuck in the sand with his new low-slung car . You had to coax him , in person , using all your womanly wiles ; if he once promised , he would not go back on it . Jane understood his point of view . Why should he come and waste his time here when he could go bass-fishing instead ? He did not need the money ; he made his killing on the summer people . Warren begged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject only the night before . Accordingto Warren , Will Harlow had a duty , as the only electrician in the community , to come when he was called , like a doctor . When Will went off to Florida last winter for a vacation , leaving everybody stranded and children 's milk spoiling in the iceboxes , Warren had seen red . But Jane said that just living was more important than fussing with other people 's electricity if you did n't have to ; Will 's customers could have put the milk out the window and waited calmly till he came back . She did not think it was fair to consider the texture of life the most important thing , for yourself , if you did n't ap/ply the same standard to poor Will , who came when it suited him or when he needed the money . This debonair statement had made Warren explode . " You mean Will Harlow comes here just for the money ? " he had cried , setting down his cup of Sanka with a bang on the table ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becausewe bribe him , " he added , breathing fire . " Of course , " replied Jane , yawning . This was truer than Warren knew . Jane had made a study of Will Harlow 's psychology , and in the summertime , when everybody was competing for him , she would put something extra out of commission to make it worth his while to come fix the stove or the icebox . She had a defective mixer that could be counted on to blow the electricity in the whole house if necessary . This was one of the little things she hid from Warren , on account of his high principles , but last night she had told him , just to shake him up . She had been reading an article in a medical magazine , explaining that anger was good for you ; it kept you from getting cancer . They had had an awful fight , and Jane , sure enough , had slept like a log . She had slept so well that when the alarm clock rang , she had turned it off and burrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . At nine o'clock , she had waked up with a start to realize that it was the day of the Berenice reading and that the Hubers and the Murphys were coming for dinner first , and after dinner , the others , Miss Lamb and Paul and the Sinnotts . They would all be awfully put out if there were no ice for their drinks . She plodded out to the telephone , in her furry scuffs and bathrobe , but it was too late : Will Harlow had already left , for his workman'sday . It was a dark rainy morning . Warren reported , after a look at the weathervane , that they were in for a threedayblow . That was why she had overslept , of course ;  |p149everybody  overslept on overcast mornings . In the bathroom , Jane drew a long face and thrust her lower lip out , staring at herself sternly in the mirror to keep a furtive giggle down . There was a funny side to it , her owlish reflection agreed : John Sinnott would tell her she had missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something went haywire . Either there was no ice or else there was no soda water , like the last time , or she had forgotten to get salt , for the dinner , or sugar , or there were mouse-droppings in the flour . These things did not matter , Warren assured her , but Jane had felt a little bit embarrassed , a few nights before , when they had had Miss Lamb to dinner , and they had found they were out of paper napkins and paper towels and kleenex , so that they had had to give her toilet paper , folded neatly by Warren , for a napkin . They used to have linen , Warren told Miss Lamb , with a tender glance , like a hug , at his rosy spouse , but Jane had given it all away , except for the sheets and pillow slips , which did not have to be ironed . When they first came up here , they had a whole trunk full of Jane 's grandmother 's beautiful embroidered linen from Germany , stored out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed the storage space for Warren 's pictures . Martha had some of the napkins now ; they looked lovely on her table , with the big Ws in heavy scroll embroidery  --  it was a lucky coincidence that both Martha 's maiden name and Jane 's grandmother 's had begun with W.Jane did not grudge this gift . She was naturally openhanded , and it also satisfied her thrifty side to see that the things were being used . She thought Martha was crazy to bother with the washing and the ironing and keeping the table polished , and it gave Jane pleasure to think of the hours she herself was saving not doing these things . When she looked at her napery gleaming onp150Martha 's dark table , she felt the same way she felt when she saw their goat munching a tin can in the zoophile lady 's back yard : she was glad she had found it a good home . She had a genius , she admitted , for finding people who would take things she did not want . Last year , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage to feed to his pigs  --  which saved her going to the dump . As it turned out , he insisted on having it sorted and he complained about broken glass and coffee grounds , so that idea had to be chalked up as a failure . But sooner or later , Jane was confident , she would solve the garbage-disposal problem , in a way that would make everybody hold up their hands in astonishment and wonder why they had not thought of it . She and Warren had tried everything : expensive chemical devices buried in the ground ; a gas incinerator that functioned in the kitchen ; burning the stuff in the fireplace or in Warren'sstudio stove . But nothing as yet had worked out to suit her ; unless you went to the dump , you always had the labor of sorting . Labor-saving schemes of one kind or another played a large part in Jane 's thoughts . It was something she had inherited , probably , from her inventor-grandfather ; Warren said that her bump of inventiveness was very much enlarged . Recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn mowers around the house and fertilize the ground with their droppings , so that some time she could have a vegetable garden  --  according to the latest theories , it was better not to weed . And she had heard of a place where you sent the sheep 's wool , which came back woven into blankets . That was what had got her started : she and Warren needed some new blankets ; the moths had got into their spare ones . Last fall , when John and Martha were staying with them , John had said , " What is this , Jane  --  a blanket forp151an octopus ? " Warren had agreed that they needed blankets , but he wanted to just buy them in a store , like other people . The sheep , he pointed out , would have to have cover , in the wintertime , and be fed , the same as the goat . And if he and Jane wanted to go away some time , during the winter months , to see some exhibitions and picture galleries , they would be stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jane argued ; all they needed was a little sheepfold that they could huddle in , during a storm ; you could just put some oats or whatever they ate out for them . But Warren was too tenderhearted . In the summer , yes , he conceded ; but he would not take responsibility in the winter . " If you can find somebody who will have them for the winter , dear , " remained his last word . Jane was very foresighted when she had her mind set on something . She would not get the sheep until spring , when she could buy them cheap , as lambs , but she had already sounded out the goat-lady and the butcher at the First National . They had both turned her down , as she had feared . And yet she still felt that there must be somebody in the community who would be glad to take care of the sheep for her . There was a balance in human psychology , she had always reasoned , like the balance of Nature ; and just as snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soil , so there had to be somebody who would find a use for those sheep during the winter months . She had been turning over the problemevery night before going to sleep , visualizing the lambs , one black , one white , and the blankets she would have woven to her own design , in a modern zigzagpattern . She had read about mathematicians who put their unconscious to work on a difficult equation and woke up with the solution . And this morning , as a matter of fact , as she was dialing a number where his wifep152thought she might reach Will Harlow , inspiration smote her . The public high school , she exclaimed to herself , widening her eyes . In a modern school like that , they must have a course in zoology or natural science , for which a pair of sheep would be perfect . And the school year exactly coincided with the months Warrendid not want the sheep . " Wonderful , dear , " agreed Warren , somewhat absently , from the kitchen , where he was coddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed ahead of her , as he sometimes did when he wanted to start painting early . " Did you get Will ? " he added , gazing sadly at the toaster , which did not seem to be working . In the doorway , Jane shook her head , recalled to the day 's agenda . " They did n't answer , " she said . " I 'll have to try and find him . He ca n't be fishing in this storm . I 'll bet he 's down at Snow 's Bungalows ; all his cronies are working there , putting up some new cabins . . . . " She added some water to last night 's coffee and turned the heat on high . " Say , " she said , thinking , " maybe I could get a piece of ice from the iceman and we could put it in the guest-room bathtub . " Warren 's face brightened obediently , and then a shadow fell on it . " There 's wood there , dear . Remember ? " Jane frowned ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the beach . It had seemed to her an ' excellent storage bin for keeping the wood dry ; last year , they had left their wood outside , under a tarpaulin , but it had alwaysgot damp . " We could put the ice in our tub , " she proposed . " You do n't need a bath . " Warren apologetically opened the dark icebox ; there was a smell of mold and spoilage . " Do n't you think it would be better to try to get Will ? " he queried . " That 's just penicillin , " said Jane briskly , but after a moment 's thought she acqui/esced . It would be less work , she calculated , to find Will Harlow than to go to the iceman and have to lug the ice out of the station wagon , dump it in the bathtub , and then chop it , by hand . She was eager to go talk to the high-school principal during the morning recess ; it did not do to postpone things and let your enthusiasm peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait ; Warren was anxious for tonight to be a success . He was full of gratitude to Miles , for buying the portrait , and he wanted everything to be nice for him . This meant that Jane would have to go and get the cleaning woman , put her to work , and drive her back home , when she was through . She would have to find Will Harlow and take the carving knife to the butcher to be sharpened ; they were having a joint for dinner . She would have to stop at Martha 's and get some herbs for the salad ; there was a torn slipcover on the sofa which she could fix in a jiffy , if she could remember to buy mending tape . They had been planning to spend the afternoon at the cove , gathering oysters  --  her mother had just sent them a patented oyster-opener  --  but the weather precluded that now . Nevertheless , it would be a busy day for her , and she would be bound to forget something important if she got distracted by the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , and for another , she ought to get Paul to open up his antique store during his lunch hour so that she could buy some stem glasses for the wine . She still had a last set of goblets stored away up above the beams in the studio , but it would be more trouble to look for them and get them down and have Mrs. Silvia wash them than it would be to get new ones , which Paul could dust out in the shop for her . That was the difficulty about a party ; everything landed on you at once . Most people here did n't care what you served itp154in , so long as they got their booze , but tonight 's guest list was a little different , more bourgeois , she supposed you could call it , though to somebody like her family Miles Murphy would be pretty startling . Warren , moreover , had been funny lately , ever since the Sinnotts had arrived . " Why ca n't we have something like this ? " he had said wistfully , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For years , he had been setting the table with cottage-cheese glasses for the wine and had never seemed to notice . He was different from Jane ; other people 's possessions stirred something in him , evidently  --  memories of his mother 's house . Jane almost thought he was envious , which was silly because they could afford anything the Sinnotts had , if they wanted it . It was a question of practicality . Martha 's fragile glasses would be broken in a week in the dishwasher  --  as Jane knew from experience  --  and nobody nowadays wanted to take the trouble to wash glasses by hand and dry them . Nevertheless , she was going to let Warren have his way . He would soon see for himself that it was not worth it to have a breathless , perspiring , frazzled wife flop down at the dinner table across from him . What he really prized was her intellectual companionship , and she could not spend the day perusing current books and magazines or just thinking , curled up on the sofa , if she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always " over " the servants and arranging flowers and looking for dust . Germs were good for you ; they built up immunities ; Jane had not had a day 's sickness , exceptduring her periods , since the vacuum cleaner broke . " I wonder whether the Murphys will come , " said Warren , peering out the window . The weathervane on the studio was whirling about wildly ; gusts of rainp155struck at the house ; the gutters ran . " They 'll come , " said Jane . It was the kind of dismal day that made people want to be together . " All the way from Digby ? " Warren said doubtfully . " They know I 'm expecting them to dinner , " answered Jane , who never worried . " They would have called by this time , if they were n't coming , so that I would n't go ahead and do the marketing . " In the station wagon , on the way to the village , Jane herself began to wonder . She could hardly see to drive , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main street was deserted . As she turned into the parking space , she saw the Sinnotts ' car , which still had its New York license plates , speeding north , out of the village , toward Digby . She could not make out who was in it , but it was burning a lot of oil , she noted ; they ought to get it fixed . Where could either of them be going , she wondered , on a morning like this ? Could they have had another fight ? Her speculations ceased as she hurried across the street to the post office in her plastic raincoat and hood , which were no protection , really . Her long full orange cotton skirt was flapping wetly around her bare ankles , and her ballet slippers were soaked . She opened her mailbox and found a telegram . " WesternUnion man just brought that around , " said the postmistress . " Your phone 's out of order ; somebody on your line left the receiver off the hook . " The smallest village idiot stood watching her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Somebody die , " he repeated in his high , loud gabble . Jane shook her head . " Telegramsdo n't mean death any more , " she said to him , kindly . She made it a policy to spread reason wherever she could . Nevertheless , her heart missed a beat ; she was afraid it was from the Murphys , begging off for tonight . Her eyes ran over the message : Warren 's mother was dead , of a stroke , yesterday , in Savannah.  |p156Her  first thought was of the roast she had had the butcher cut specially the day before . Death was peculiar ; it made things like that pop into your mind . Still , it was a problem whether she could return it ; being an only child , Warren , of course , would have to go to the funeral . She would have to cancel the play-reading . A deep disappointment took hold of her , as she tried to tell herself , by way of comfort , that at least the day would be simplified . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get Will Harlow . But it was a cheerless comfort ; without the plans to fill it , the day seemed bereft . And Warren would have to be away for three days at the very least ; when he came back , he might want to go into mourning . They would never have the play-reading , she said to herself sadly , stuffing the telegraminto her Mexican leather pouch . She would have to call the Murphys and tell Paul , in the liquor store , and call the Hubers and Martha , who could tell Miss Lamb . They would all be let down just because one old lady had happened to die the day before . It made her think of the time when her fifteenth birthday party had to be canceled because her brother had come down with polio . The Greeks had a better idea ; when somebody died , they feasted , to show that life went on . All at once , she realized that the idiot and the postmistresswere both watching her , avidly , she thought . Wrapping her raincoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore to telephone . They would have to know right away , so they could make other dinner plans . What a waste , she said to herself . But as she trudged through the rain , two thoughts struck her . What was the matter with her ? Obviously , Warren could not take the plane ; all flights would be canceled . Accordingto her car radio , the storm was general throughoutcoastal New England . She could drive him to Trow/bridge , to get the afternoon train , but he would not reach New York till nearly midnight , too late , probably , to catch the sleeper for Savannah . He might just as well stay here and wait to get a plane in the morning , when the weather would doubtless clear . He could go to Boston , of course , in the hope that flights would be resumedagain this afternoon or this evening , but he might not get a seat ; Friday was a bad travel day . And there was a second obstacle . What was he going to wear ? Jane had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother was failing . In the south , as she knew , people were stuffy about the ceremonialof mourning . A black band sewn on his corduroy sleeve would not be enough , probably , to satisfy Warren'scousins and his aunt . He could stop off in Boston and get a ready-made dark suit and a pair of black shoes ; but it seemed crazy to spend the money on something he would wear only the once . Moreover , there was the time factor . He would have to have the suit altered . Readymadepants were always too long for him and too baggy in the seat . Even if he took the suit to some little tailor , it would take a couple of hours for the alteration to be done , what with the pressing and everything : he might miss the plane , if there was one , hanging around and waiting . Last week , however , Jane had had a brain wave . Seeing John Sinnott walk into a party in his dark-blue suit , she had realized that he and Warren had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller , but his shoulders and waist were narrow , like Warren 's , and he had a small behind ; she had checked on this point when they were in swimming , in the nude . The blue suit would be just right for Warren , if she turned up the trousers ; there was a steam-iron put away somewhere in the studio that she could press them with . Black or a dark oxford would have been better , but there no pointp158in repining . It was a piece of luck that the only dark suit in all New Leeds  --  except the bank president 's  --  should have come here with the Sinnotts in September . If Warren 's mother had died last year , there would have been no suit for him at all . The blue was very dark , almost midnight , and it would look very nice with Warren'sblue eyes . And John had a lot of neckties ; she had seen them hanging on his bureau , some of them in dark , conservative colors . Warren had only two : bright wools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to buy , in Trowbridge or Digby . John 's feet were too long , though narrow , and Paul 's black shoes , which he wore for state occasions , were short enough but too broad . Even if Warren were to wear several pairs of wool socks , he would not be comfortable , and foot comfort was important , psychologically  --  thatwas why they went barefoot so much . Sitting in the drugstore phone booth , with her wet skirt and petticoat bundled about her , Jane took out a coin and hesitated . There was no use trying to get Warren yet , if their phone was out of order . It came to her that it must be she who had left the receiver off the hook , while she was calling Will Harlow and thinking about the sheep . And even if Warren had replaced it in the meantime , he would be in his studio now , out of earshot of the phone . With the planes not flying , there was no hurry about telling him . She decided to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she remembered seeing the Sinnotts ' car heading out of town . What was she going to do if they were off somewherefor the day ? She dropped in the coin , and Martha answered . She had been trying to get Jane , she said , to tell her they could not come to the play-reading becauseJohn had had to go to Boston this morning top159finish some research . Jane heard her out , without interruption ; she could have saved Martha her breath by telling her about Warren 's mother , but she was curious to know what explanation the Sinnotts had cooked up between them : any fool could see that John had gone to Boston to avoid having to meet Miles tonight . For herself , Jane wanted to find out diplomatically , before asking straight out , whether the blue suit was here or whether it had gone off too . " I thought I saw John , " she said . " Dashing out of the post office . What was he wearing ? " " A raincoat , " said Martha . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why yes , I think so , " said Martha . " Yes , he was , " she added , more positively . Jane caught her breath . " How long is he going to be gone ? " " Just today , " said Martha . " He has to see somebody for dinner . He 'll be back late tonight . " " Oh , " said Jane . A new idea was forming in her mind . It was clear now that Warren could not leave till tomorrow in any case ; he would have to wait on the weather and the suit . There was no reason , therefore , why they should not have the play-reading . Warren himself had been looking forward to it for a week now . He and Jane had read the play , together , in Masefield 's English translation , and he wanted to discuss with Martha the peculiar philosophybehind it . He would be horribly disappointed if the project fell through . But of course , with his mother dead , he would think that they ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just because of the forms . He had been expecting her death anyway ; after all , she was seventy-nine , and when he had gone down to see her last year , he must have realized it was good-bye . And it was not as if his knowing , today , could do any good . If the telegram had said , " Mother dying , " that would have been different : he would have wanted to telephonep160and start off as fast as he could , even though she would be unconscious and incapable of recognizing him  --  that was how she had conditioned him . But since the old lady was gone , what could be the harm of letting him have the play-reading before he found out ? It was only an accident , actually , Jane suddenly perceived , that she had got the telegram this morning . There were some days when they did not go for the mail at all , and she often left the receiver off the hook for twenty-four hours without noticing it . Actually , if it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed there in the box without their knowing it until tomorrowat least . So to all intents and purposes , it was as if she had not got it yet . And how much better it would be , from everybody 's point of view , if she had not happened to stop in at the post office just now . . . . If Warrenwas going to grieve , in spite of having worked through his mother-attachment with the psychoanalyst , he might as well begin tomorrow , Jane said to herself in her practical voice . There was nothing he could do anyway , and useless suffering was the worst kind ; that was the good part about funerals  --  they gave the relations something to put their minds on . If she were in Warren'splace and it was her mother , she would want him to spare her until she could get off on a pla.ie and start making the funeral arrangements . She would want him to have the play-reading for her . Absently listening to Martha , Jane made her decision . The play must go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow feeling in her stomach . For one wild instant , she considered taking Martha into her confidence , but prudence intervened : if she was not going to tell Warren , it was better that nobody should know until tomorrow morning . And Martha might disapprove . She was telling Jane now all the virtuous reasons why she toop161could not come to the play-reading : she had some letters to write ; she had bought some green tomatoes and was going to make a pickle ; she had no car and it was too far for Dolly to come for her . " I 'm sorry , " she wound up . " But after all you do n't need me . There are only seven parts . Dolly can do Berenice ; her French is much better than mine . And you can do the confidante . " " Do n't be a nut , " said Jane , feeling cross with Martha . " Of course , we need you . You 're the only professional . Warren will die if you do n't come . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was happy in the thought that she and Miles could be friends again , thanks to the portrait . But Martha kept sounding reluctant . She would rather not , she insisted . " Is it because of Miles ? " Jane demanded , boldly . Partly , Martha admitted . But it was not only that , she pretended ; she had all those things to do and she wanted to be home , for John , when he got back from Boston : he would have an awful drive in this weather . Jane made a face . " Why , you do n't want to stay there all alone , waiting for him , " she exclaimed in scoffing tones . " If he has dinner in Boston , he wo n't be back till one in the morning . " " Yes , " acknowledgedMartha . " You 'll be home by that time , " Jane pointed out . " Warren will come and get you and bring you back afterward . You might as well come to dinner ; I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't , " said Martha faintly . " Not to dinner . " " Because of the Murphys ? Do n't be crazy , " said Jane . " You do n't have to be afraid of them . Miles is still in love with you . Everybodysays so . That 's why he bought the portrait . " " That is n't true , " Martha 's voice protested . " And if it were , it would be all the more reason . . . . " " Not to come ? " said Jane . " I do n't see that at all . He 's settled down now . He 's not going to do anything unless you encouragep162him . Anyway , " she added , " they may not come . Because of the weather . And somebody 's got to eat that roast . " " No , " said Martha . This firmness was not like Martha , Jane said to herself . " Is it John ? " she ventured . " Did he tell you not to come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , " remarked Jane . " You 'll be home before he is . " " Oh , I could n't do that , " cried Martha in a horrified voice . " Well , then , tell him after he gets back . Tell him you felt lonely . Why should n't you go out to dinner if he does in Boston ? " " I do n't know , " said Martha . " I must say , it does sound rather silly when you think about it . " " Then you 'll come , " said Jane . She felt Martha hesitate . " No , " Martha said finally . " I 'd better not . He might call me , from Boston , and it would worry him if I were n't here . " " He calls you up , " exclaimedJane , " when he 's just gone for the day ? " " Sometimes , " said Martha , proudly . Jane considered this strange ; to her mind , it argued a lack of security . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't call . I 'll have Warren stop by for you at seven . Do n't forget to . bring your book ; we 've only got two copies , unless HarrietHuber finds one . And bring some herbs from your garden . " " No , " pleaded Martha , but Jane rang off . She was certain Martha would come , to the play-reading , if not to dinner , and probably to both . But as soon as she felt satisfied that she had won her point , a slight uneasiness beset her . She was not sure that Warren would approve of Martha 's coming to dinner ; they had agreed that it would be better for the Sinnotts to arrive afterward , so as not to embarrass the Murphys . To Jane 's mind , John 's absence altered everything : Martha would just be an extra woman who could be slipped in next to Harold Huber , like somebodyyou were having for charity . But Warren mightp163not see it that way ; he might feel that Jane had betrayedhim . And if he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuffy phone booth , Jane felt suddenly queasy ; she rested her head against the telephone and tried to collect herself . Her eyes wandered sidewise out into the drugstore ; the druggist had his back turned and the soda-fountain girl was reading a comic book . But Jane had the conviction that they had just been watching her and listening to her conversation . Against all reason , the notion fastened itself on her that the whole village knew that Warren 's mother was dead . She drove her station wagon very slowly out toward the cleaning woman 's house ; two cars passed her , as she crawled along , and again she felt that eyes had turned to study her . There was nothing unusual in that , she assured herself ; she was a bit of a curiosity in the village and people always stared . They thought she was a character , just because she was sensible and easygoing . Her ideas made people laugh , and she did not mind ; all her brothers had teased her , and in boarding school and college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People laughed at her because she was innocently logical . She was being logical , now , about Warren 's mother ; she had thought it out , step by step , reasonably , as she did all her ideas . Nobody could possibly know about the telegram ( that was all her imagination ) ; the Western Union man was a typical closemouthed Yankee who would not tell anybody anything , not even the time of day , unless he had authorization . There were dozens of stories about him . Jane 's heart began to race . She had overlooked one factor . Supposing the Western Union man telephoned to make sure the telegram had reached them ? She had no way of knowing whether the phone was still off the hook . Faintness overtook her . She was not used to deception , she realized , except in small things ; up to now ,  |p164she  had only told white lies and did not mind being caught in them . In fact , it was rather fun to let Warren catch her in an untruth ; quite often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid playing hide-and-seek , just to let him pounce on her , the way he had last night . But now , for the first time , she recognized , she had done something that Warren might take a grave view of . He might not think it was funny or delightfully in character for Jane to be suppressing this telegram . And once she started lying , she would have to keep it up . If she did not produce the telegram the minute she got home , she would have to claim she had never got it , no matter what , assuming she was questioned . Her original plan had been to " discover " the telegram in their mailboxearly tomorrow morning , when she could come to the village on some pretext . Warren , she reckoned , would be too busy packing and trying on the suit to press any inquiries about why it had not been delivered earlier . And by the time he got back from Savannah , it would be too late to follow it up ; nobody would remember . Only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegram this morning , and one of them , after all , was an idiot , who did not know one day of the week from another . The real problem , she now decided , was the Western Union man , who was the old-fashioned , conscientioustype . If the phone was still off the hook and he kept trying to get them , he might send a man out from the phone company or even drive out himself in his old Ford to deliver it in person . Or would he check with the postmistress , to find whether the Coes had got their mail ? That would make three people who knew . And what if Warren 's relations , down there , got worried when they did not hear from him and put a tracer on the telegram ? Jane stopped the car by the roadside . She was shiver/ing all over . This was what it felt like , apparently , to embark on a career of crime . It was not worth it ; she could see that at once . Honesty was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting there , at the women who made a practice of deceiving their husbands . How did they do it ? She thought of the New Leeds wives who had had clandestine love affairs : Ellen Gray , in the old days , and Martha , when she was married to Miles . She could understand their doing it once , but to keep it up , as a regular thing ? Her teeth began to chatter , as her mind stole amazedly back over the course of romantic history : Queen Guinevere , Mary Stuart  --  living every hour in the fear of discovery . How had they done it ? She had never approved , much , of adultery ; the fun of marriage was sharing things with your mate . But she had never before considered how much courage adultery took , far more than the act repaid  --  daysof suspense for a few seconds of pleasure . She had always thought of herself as a hardy soul , but now she saw that she had never really dared . Daring , she cogitated , was a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you had to compute probabilities . And there was always the unforeseen , the little thing you overlooked that would catch you up in the end  --  what they called contingency . She herself already felt like a different person , just for thinking of deceiving Warren , or rather she felt the same , but everything else had changed and become somehow slippery , like when Alice went through the looking-glass  --  into the fourth dimension , Warren said ; that mathematician had explained it to him . Devoted as she was to Warren , she had always found his mathematical theories a little bit boring , and she noticed that other people did too . But now she perceived that there was a human side to all that : people who were afraid began to count and reckon , just as she was doing ,  |p166and  they were faced , straight off , with infinity . And when you were afraid , something queer happened to time . Looking at her watch , she found that only ten minutes had passed since she left the drugstore , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evidently , were racing like her pulse ; that was what it must mean to live a double life , like Paul . And yet , she reflected , it was not anything wrong she was contemplating . To keep Warren in ignorance was the kindest and most sensible thing . It would be almost a sacrifice , on her part , to go through all this anxiety so that he could have a few hours ' peace . The only way it could hurt Warren not to know would be if the story got out that he had had a party the night after his mother 's death . But he could always say that he did n't know , which would be true . Furthermore , it was not a party , exactly , but something educational . After all , it was a tragedy they were going to read , which would put Warren right in the mood . A smile twitched at Jane 's lips ; her eyes goggled . She felt tickled by her own power of reasoning . Other people would say she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . Was n't tragedy supposed to be a cathartic ? She put on an innocent expression and arrangedher plastic hood attractively over her tawny hair . A brand-new idea had come to her . She was going to the Western Union office and send a telegram for Warren to his old aunt : " Impossible leave today becauseof storm . Taking plane Savannah tomorrow morning . Grief-stricken . Love to all . " But as she considered this message , she saw that it would not do . It would satisfy the Western Union man , but the dating would give her away . Warren 's aunt would be bound to let the cat out of the bag by asking Warren about the storm ; old people like that were always interested in weatherp167conditions . Jane pondered . Lying was not easy , when you had to cover your tracks . But it stimulated your brain , like doing a chess problem : you had to think ahead to all the possible moves on the other side of the board . The easy thing would be to go home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not bear to give up , now that she was started . A solution would come to her ; solutions always had . The point was to word a telegram so that it could sound as if it had been sent tomorrow , in case Warren ever saw it , and at the same time to fix it so that the Western Union man would not wonder . . . . Just as she was despairing , the light suddenly broke : she would send a night letter ! " Warren taking plane . He will arrive Savannah , today , Saturday , p.m. and will phone you from airport . Both of us very sad to hear of mother 's passing . Condolences to all . Signed , Jane Coe . " She counted over the words to make sure it was long enough not to surprise the Western Union man that it was going as a night letter ; luckily , her small economies were famous in the village . He would not think a thing of it , unless she started explaining . " Never apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting up the engine . Tomorrow morning , when she brought Warren the bad news , she would tell him that she had just sent that message for him , from the Western Union office , and he would say , " Wonderful , dear , " as he always did when she thought ahead for him . Then , even if his aunt should happen to show him the telegram , Warren would be too hot and bothered to notice the NL , for night letter , up among the symbols at the top . If he did , he would think it was a mistake . In the little telegraph office , heated by a station-stove , Jane lost her usual aplomb . The Western Union man in his brown buttoned sweater unnerved her ; he was sop168silent and poky . He did not make a sound as she wrote out the message for him , printing in big letters . She felt she ought to say something as his cracked brown finger moved laboriously over the yellow sheet she handed him , marking each word while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up over his glasses and scratched his head . " Sure you want to send it this way , Mrs. Coe ? " he said , with a sharp look . Jane nearly passed out ; she felt just as she used to when she was called into the head mistress 's office . " As a night letter , you mean ? " she blurted out . " Yes . . . I think so . . . . It 's cheaper , and the person it 's going to will be out all day anyway . When they get it , you see , today will be tomorrow , or the other way around . " She could have killed herself when the telegrapher , nodding his old head slowly back and forth like a rocker , finally saw fit to reply . " That 's your business , " he observed . " Twere n't that I was thinking of . " He got up from his stool and meandered over to the window . " Looks to me , " he said , " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane tomorrow morning . " Relief made Jane giddy ; she nearly laughed aloud . " Why do n't you add , Weather permitting ' ? " she suggested brightly , pointing to the telegram . " Put it after plane . ' Weather permitting , he will arrive Savannah . . . ' ? " The telegrapher considered . " That 's it , " he nodded . " Do n't cost you no more . " Jane bolted out of the office . He was a rare one , all right , she said to herself , and he held her in the palm of his hand , if he only knew it , like that awful creature in Madame Bovary . She was still shaking when she drove up to the cleaning woman 's house and parked for a minute to steady her nerves before having to face another native . The way they watched you steadily , without saying a word , seemed to her suddenly sinister , like being surrounded in the jungle . She longed for a confidante , top169whom she could explain herself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some day , she decided , she would tell him what she had gone through this morning , and they would laugh about it together ; it would become one of Jane 's exploits . " Do you remember the time your mother died ? " she could hear herself begin , and her face , in the car mirror , at once assumed a sheepish bad-girl look , with the lower lip thrust out and the long chin dropped , while the big blue eyes rolled appealingly , ready to dance , if only a partner invited . She was two people , really , as Warren had delightedly discovered , first on their honeymoon , and then again and again , just as he thought he had her settled . There were big Jane and little Jane , stern Jane and guilty Jane , downcast Jane and blithe Jane  --  she knew this from scolding herself as she used to scold her doll . And it was bad Jane , she recognized , who had the upper hand this morning . She had just done somethingawful . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in the mirror , she promptly felt much better . Fear left her ; some day she would confess to Warren and that would take care of remorse . She honked the horn for the cleaning woman and waited , at the wheel , unflurried . There was plenty of time for everything , so long as she took it easy and reminded herself that nothing mattered , really . She could still get Will Harlow , and if she did n't , so much the worse . Moreover , if she was lucky , she might catch the high-school principalat lunch , when she went to get the glasses.  |p170Titus  reginam Beronicen , cui etiam nuptias pollicitusferebatur . . . statim ab Urbe dimisit invitus invitam . " Miles cleared his throat and looked around the Goes ' living room . The dinner dishes were cleared , and the play-reading was about to begin . Warren and Jane Coe sat by the fireplace , sharing a book and a hassock . They had elected not to take parts ; it would be more fun , they said , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Martha was looking on with the vicomte ; Dolly with Harold Huber , a thin white-haired man in a red flannel shirt who used to be a lawyer and now ran a duck farm ; Miles with Harriet Huber , a big pink woman with a gray pompadour . Helen Murphy had not come . The child was sick , and Helen had been calling all day , to try to change the date to next week , but somebody on the line had left the receiver off the hook , so in the end Miles had driven over alone , not to let the Goes down . Martha was alone too , and for a while , at dinner , it had looked as if she and Miles were going to play opposite each other , as the Emperor and the Jewish queen , but Martha had insisted that Berenice be given to Dolly . Martha was quite high ; the gin-and-french , without ice , before dinner , had evidently gone to her head , and she had gulped a lot of claret . Warren had not seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to Miles , and he had felt troubled as he repeatedly filled her empty wine glass . Her dark eyes glittered inp171her pale oval face , and she spoke very positively , interruptingMiles in the middle of his harangues . At the same time , she looked very pretty , with her tapering neck and gold knot of hair , like a girl in a locket ; she had not reached the usual New Leeds state , where the eyes would narrow and the features slip out of drawing , like a loose mask  --  a thing Warren hated , no matter how many times he saw it happen . He was apprehensive for Martha , knowing her as he did and sharing her nervousnessabout Miles . An outsider might not have realized that she was tight , but Dolly Lamb , Warren noticed , when she came in after dinner with the vicomte , had given her a quick , quizzical look , the minute she heard her laughing , in clear , sharp peals , at something that was not awfully funny . Martha had noticed the look too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asked for more coffee , but unfortunately it had run out , and Warren did not want to bother Jane , who seemed tired and preoccupied , with making a fresh pot . Instead , he hopped out to the kitchen and brought everybody a glass of water . " Titus reginam Beronicen , " Miles began again . " Reginam , " murmured Martha to the vicomte , with a grimace , making the g hard . " I hate that soft , squelchy church Latin ; after all , it 's Tacitus he 's quoting . " The vicomte furled his lower lip , like a little flag , and shrugged . " A matter of taste , " he said . " Who knows how the Romans pronounced ? " " We do know , " whispered Martha . " Quiet ! " Warren begged . " I want to hear Miles translate it . " " Say , " said Harold Huber , " include me out on the Latin . We came here to parler francais , the way Harriet got it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undertone , pointing to the text . " Racine gives the locus classicus he got the plot from . " " Oh , " replied Harold Huber . " Shoot , " he said to Miles . " Against his will and hers , Titus sent Queen Berenice , whom , it isp172said , he had even promised to marry , away from the City . ' " Miles glanced at Martha for confirmation . She nodded . " He , unwilling , sent her , unwilling , away , ' " she said dreamily . " Statim ' . At once . ' " " Pronto , " Miles chuckled . " Forthwith . Subito . There you have it , boys and girls . Yet in Racine it takes five acts to bring off . " He took out a handkerchief and blew a trumpet blast on his long nose . " Racine 's a microscopist , " he explained . " A slow-motion camera trained on the passions . " " Precisely , " said Martha . " Unlike Corneille , " continued Miles , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist  --  bear in mind that this is the seventeenth century , the great age of French science and invention . " Warren nudged Jane . " Gee , this is interesting , " he said . " Racine , " Miles went on , with a gimlet stare at his audience , " is a scientific observer of human behavior ; he takes a single action and enlarges it , under his microscope , the way you might study a plant or the organs of an animal . " " Yes , " put in Martha , excitedly . " How clever of you , Miles . That 's why the unities were necessary to Racine . People think the unities were arbitrary and artificial  --  a convention of academicians . But I can see that you could look at them as scientific , as if he were setting up a laboratory , for a controlled experiment . " " Excuse me for living , " Warren bashfully interjected , when he saw that she was through , " but what are the unities ? " The vicomte sighed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huber yawned . " Time , space , and action , " ventured Dolly . Martha nodded . " The action takes place in one day on a single set . Here it 's the cabinet or closet , as they used to call it  --  Titus 's glorified private study , where he transactshis personal business . Next door , on one side , stage right , I think , are his imperial apartments ; stage left , on the other side , are the apartments of the queen , Berenice.  |p173Rome  and Jerusalem , and the parley-ground between . " " What 's she doing there , anyway ? " inquired Harold Huber . " She 's his guest , " said Martha . " She and her suite . In history , her brother Agrippa was with her . " " Is n't she Titus 's mistress ? " Jane wondered . " Evidently , " said the vicomte , widening his blue eyes . Miles and Martha exchanged an interrogatory look . " I do n't think so , " said Martha . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't set it up that way . For five years , they 've been engaged , but he has n't tampered with her . Racine makes that plain in the preface "  --  he tapped the book  --  " where he compares her to Dido . Berenice , he says , does n't have to die in the end because she , unlike Dido with Aeneas , had n't gone the whole way with young Titus . " " Oh , I bet they slept together , " said Jane airily . " Everybody knows about those long engagements . You ca n't tell me they did n't have intercourse . " She giggled . A look of amusement passed between Miles and Martha . " Not in Racine , Jane , " said Martha . " He says they did n't , and you have to suspend your disbelief for the purposes of the play . " " Maybe they did in history , dear , " said Warren . " But this is a work of art , and you have to accept the artist 's convention . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they did n't sleep together , that was the whole trouble . That 's why their affair fizzled out . If he 'd had them sleep together , he could have had a happy ending . " " Maybe that 's why he did n't , " suggested Dolly gravely . " He did n't want a happy ending , you mean ? " put in Warren . " Right , " said Miles . " Will somebody please tell us what this is all about ? " Plump Harriet Huber querulously patted her pompadour . Except for her batik robes and the priests ' vestmentsshe sometimes wore , she was a very ordinary woman , who had formerly been a singer . Harold Huber was brighter than she was and keen as a whip , Warrenp174and , on his specialty , which had been railroad law . He had come a cropper through some arbitrage deal and nearly been put in jail , but he had a sharp head for business and had made good , up here , with his duck farm , which he had bought up cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Paris . Everybody ate ducks , to help Harold , but poor Harriet always seemed a little out of things , like somebody 's mother . " All you people , " she complained now , " seem to have read the play ahead of time . " " Yes , Miles , give us the story , " chimed in Harold Huber . " I think Paul should do it , " said Jane with a hostess 's eye on the vicomte , who sat blinking drowsily in his canvas chair . " Let the baron tell it , " Miles conceded grandly . " Ah well , " said the vicomte , opening his eyes , " it is many years since I have seen it performed . Mon oncle , le duc , took me when I was a little shaver , to see Bernhardt in the role . It was before her break with the Comedic . Francaise . He had a mistress , I believe , who was playing the part of the confidante  --  yourpart , my dear girl , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel between her and Bernhardt . " " Let 's get on with the story , " Miles said impatiently . But Paul was offended . " You tell it , my friend , " he said . " It 's nothing . A ficelle . Marion pleure , Marion crie ; Marion veut qu ' on la marie , ' as Voltaire wittily said . " He broke off into a fit of coughing . " I do n't believe he knows it at all , " Jane whispered to Warren . " Not Voltaire  --  " began Martha . " Ssh , " said Warren . " Titus , " commenced Miles , " the new Emperor of Rome , loves Queen Berenice of Judaea . " " What you would call today a puppet queen , " interjected the vicomte , smoothing his long bob . " Titus , " said Miles , " has conquered Jerusalem . " " The Arch of Titus , " whispered Dolly , to Harold Huber . " Quiet ! " implored Warren . " Titus , " Miles resumed at a brisker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he conceives the notion of marrying her . His father  --  " " Vespasian , " announced Martha . " Damn it , Martha , " exclaimed Miles . " Stop helping me . Tell the story yourself . " He folded his arms and scowled . " Shall I ? " Martha appealed to the company , as Miles remained stubbornly silent , his narrow lips set . " Go ahead , Martha , " said Jane . " All right , then , " said Martha . " When the play opens , it 's Titus 's wedding day . His father , Vespasian , has died , just a few days before , I think , and Titus is now Caesar . In her apartments , Berenice is waiting to be married . She does n't realize ( dramatic irony ) that Titus has decided to renounce her , because Roman law and custom forbid Caesar to marry a queen and a foreigner . " " Why ? " said Harriet Huber . " Prejudice , " said the vicomte , looking at them over a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . " It is the same as with us in France . Ever since they threw their own kings out , the Romans detestaient les rois . " " The Senate , " resumed Martha , " has reminded Titus of his duty and he comes to tell Berenice that he 's going to send her back to Judaea  --  unwillingly . " The vicomte looked up from the text . " But Berenice is naughty , " he supplied . " She takes it in a bad spirit  --  not nobly  --  protests that he is tired of her and threatens to kill herself . Eh bien , Titus , who loves her still , becomes a bad boy too and threatens to kill himself . When the lovely Berenice hears this , she knows that he loves her and rises to her full height . " The vicomte sat up in his chair , threw his chest out and held himself at attention . " She renounces Titus , of her own volition , and sets sail for Judaea , promising not to die . Titus stays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that 's all ? " said Harriet Huber , curiously . " That 's all , " said the vicomte , settling back in his chair with a somewhat triumphant expression . " You forgotp176Antiochus , " prompted Martha . " Ah yes , " said the vicomte . " The king of Comagena . It is the part I will take . Another Oriental , like Berenice . Another barbarian . He is Titus 's rival . He loves Berenice and hopes to get her , what do you say , on the rebound . But in the end he too renounces . He gives up his crafty design and becomes like a Roman . " There was a silence . Dolly frowned . " It 's rather like an Austen novel , is n't it ? " she timidly observed . " All the characters become educated ; they grow up and buckle down to their duties , like Emma marryingMr . Knightley . " She screwed up her brows . " It sounds awfully uncomfortable , " she added , with a little shiver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charactershave growing pains . That is what tragedy is . " " Let me ask you a question , " said Warren , who had been waiting dutifully for an opening in the conversation . " Why does n't Titus give up the job of Emperor and just marry Berenice and live like a plain citizen ? " " Like the Duke of Windsor , " exclaimed Harriet . " I knew it reminded me of something . The woman I love . ' " She laughed a little and looked at her husband . But Jane , who seemed out of sorts for some reason this evening , turned impatiently on Warren . " Oh , Warren , " she said , " you know the answer to that . It 's right there in the play . " " I forget , " confessed Warren . Miles opened the book . " Act V , Scene 6 , " he noted , and began to declaim , addressing himself to Dolly : " Oui , madame , et je dois moins encore vous dire Que je suis pret pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trop content de mes fers , Soupir avec vous au bout de l'univers . " " Is n't that just like the Duke of Windsor ? " cried Harriet . " To sigh with you at the ends of the earth ' ? Was n't there something like that in that record he made ? " Shep177hunted in her text . " Je suis pret pour vous abandonner l'empire . . . ? " She turned a questioning glance on her husband . " Probably the Duke of Windsor copied it out of Racine , " declared Jane , rounding her eyes and dropping her jaw . " Hardly , " said Miles , with a curt , silencing nod in her direction . He continued , his green eyes fixed on Dolly : " Vous meme rougieriez de ma ldche conduite Vous verriez a regret marcher a votre suiteUn indigne empereur sans empire , sans tour , Vil spectacle aux humains de la faiblesse de l'amour . " Dolly colored , as if in character , under Miles 's stare . " There , you see , Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his empire , trailing around after her , and with all those trunks . . . . " " What trunks , darling ? " Warren turned to her anxiously . " I do n't get your point . " " Why , the Duchess of Windsor 's , of course , " retortedJane . " Everybody knows about her traveling with seventy trunks of dresses . In Titus 's day , probably , in Palestine , it would have been on camels . " Harold Huber guffawed . " But Jane is quite right , " interposed the vicomte , with an air of virtuous reproof . " That is what Titus would have become if he had married the queen for love  --  a flunkey . " " Un indigne empereur . . . vil spectacle aux humains de la faiblesse de l'amour , ' " quoted Miles again in a sonorous voice ; his French was extremely fluent , but he spoke with a rolling accent that made it sound like an Irish brogue . The vicomte and Martha smiled . " But is love a weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here think love is a weakness ? " " In a king , certainly , " said the vicomte , folding his hands . " Do you agree with that , Miles ? " Warren turned to his friend . " Not only in a king , " he said finally , in his drawling voice . " In any man , I would say . Love is forp178boys and women . " Martha 's fair brows made two skepticalarcs , but she said nothing . Warren looked hopefully around the circle , but nobody rose to love 's defense . " What about Plato ? " he said to Miles , in a tone of diffidentreminder . " That is n't what Plato says . " " Plato meant something different , " Miles replied brusquely . " The concept you 're thinking of  --  romantic love  --  was unknown to him . " " That 's not what I got out of him , " protested Warren . " If that is n't romantic love in the Symposium , what is it ? " he said . " Transcendence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love , mortal love , as we understand it . " Miles tapped his foot in its fancy shoe . " Oh , excuse me , " she said , demurely . " I interruptedagain . " " I agree with Miles , " Jane suddenly proclaimed . " In a man , love is a weakness . " Warren jumped up from the hassock . He was quivering all over . " You do n't mean that , " he said incredulously . " Oh yes , " said Jane . " Well , all I can say  --  " he began , and then words failed him . " I could eat that rug , " he finally announced , pointing to a cotton string rug of a tattletale gray shade that lay in front of the fireplace . Dolly 's humorous eyebrowslifted inquiringly as she examined the rug and then Warren . " Not really ? " she murmured . " Really ! " replied Warren fiercely , clenching and unclenching his jaws as if he were about to bite into it . " Calm down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the play ? " suggested Harold Huber . " Let 's postpone the arguments of counsel till after the case had been presented . " The play-reading proceeded . Warren , choking back his emotions , acted as monitor . He and Jane  --  he explained to the newcomers , with a bitter glance at his mate  --  had read aloud so many times , both to each other and in groups , that they had worked out a set of rules for it . Nobody was to interrupt the reading during an act ;  |p179at  the end of each act , questions of translation could be asked . Questions of interpretation were to be deferred until the whole play had been read , and no side remarks were tolerated . Laughing was strictly forbidden except in the case of a comedy . Drinks were served after the reading . As he enunciated these rules , hollow laughter echoed in the chambers of his heart . He felt like that French schoolmaster giving the Last Glass in conquered Alsace-Lorraine . His marriage was over , probably , after tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt about things . He loved her , and she considered it a weakness . To go on after that would be hypocrisy . Rules , he said to himself wanly . He and Jane made them together , and then she broke them . It was just like these play-readings , where he , poor simp , tried to keep order and everybody laughed at him . And the regulationsthey had made  --  except the one about drinking  --  were harder on him than anybody . When an interesting point came up , he could hardly hold himself in ; waiting till the end for a discussion was agony , especially since by the time they had finished , nobody else ever seemed to remember the passage he had in mind . But it was not fair to the author , he and Jane had agreed , to pick a play to pieces before it had had a chance to say its whole say . Yet she was always one of the worst offenders , giggling and interrupting and popping her eyes or making trips to the kitchen during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he constantly had to remind her that the play or the poem had the floor . But tonight , as he slowly became aware , she was more subdued than usual , as if she knew what she had done to him and the reckoning that lay ahead for both of them , after the others had gone . She did not poke him when Miles gave a funny reading or when Martha overacted her part . She sat listening , thoughtfully , her chin sunk in her hand.  |p180Her  mind , he could suddenly tell , was a million miles away from him , though he could feel the comfortable warmth of her big vital body next to him , on the hassock . She had no idea how she had wounded him , evidently , and , soothed by her physical presence , he gradually let himself relent toward her , even though he knew that this was the worst crime one human could commit against another : not to take their words seriously . When she turned and smiled at him , vaguely , during the first intermission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling like Judas Iscariot . He turned his attention to the play . He had hoped he would like it better in French than he had when the two of them had read it in English , but instead it let him down even more . Unlike Jane , he was not musical , and that , he guessed , was the trouble : the jingling alexandrinessounded monotonous to him , even when Paul was reading . He liked Dolly best ; her accent was neat and pretty , though she did not put much expression into her lines . Martha and the vicomte were frowning over their text when Dolly came to the big scene of despair and jealousy in the fourth act , where she was supposed to be waiting for Titus in a state of extreme disorder . Martha , as her waiting woman , read her own lines with unnecessaryurgency , as if she were trying to push Dolly into the proper mood : " Mais voulez-vous parditre en ce desordre extreme ? Remettez vous , madame , et rentrez en vous-meme . Laissez-moi relever ces voiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sont caches . SoufJrez que de vos pleurs je repare l'outrage . " This sounded very comical , in Martha 's quick , passionatevoice , while Dolly sat there , cool as a cucumber , notp181a silvery blond hair out of place . Even Miles looked up and chuckled when Dolly replied , in her circumspect tinkling bell-tones : " Laisse , laisse , Phenice ; it verra son ouvrage . " Warren had to call twice for silence before Dolly could go on with her part . She was at her best , Warren thought , in the final passage , when she turned to the vicomte , with imperturbable dignity , like the senior prefect in her boarding school : " Sur Titus et sur moi , reglez votre conduite . Je l'aime , je le fuis ; Titus m'aime ; it me quitte . Portez loin de mes yeux vos soupirs et vos fers . Adieu . Servons tous trois d'exemple a l'univers . " It was a pretty poor example they were going to set the universe , in Warren 's opinion , but at least Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Unfortunately , he missed the first part of the discussion , because he was busy fixing drinks for everybody . Even Jane wanted one , to his surprise ; she asked for a bourbon and fizzy , and drank it straight down when he brought it . " I was thirsty , " she said . All the dinner guests were thirsty , it turned out ; there had been a mite too much salt in the roast . Dolly took a glass of port , and the vicomte joined her . " I thought you did n't drink , " exclaimedMartha , tactlessly , for the vicomte often drank , in moderation , since his reform . The Hubers and Marthahad Scotch ; Miles had a big drink of bourbon , to wet his whistle , as he called it . Warren himself had a glass of plain fizzy , when he finally joined the circle . Martha and Miles , on good terms again , were talking about the influenceof Port Royal on Racine , and the Hubers seemed rather out of it . They had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and people alwaysforgot that they were not intellectuals . Warren brought the subject back to the play , which they could all share.  | " How terribly Protestant it is , " said Dolly , making a little face . " But naturally , " said the vicomte . " Port Royal was Jansenist . That is a Protestant heresy . Racine had it in his bones . " " Why do you say Protestant , ' Miss Lamb ? " demanded Harriet Huber . " What 's the difference , Miss Lamb ? " Martha answered for her , taking a long drink . " Setting a good example . Renunciation . Training the will . Scruples . " " But do n't the Catholics have those ? " Harriet asked the vicomte . " We are not puritans , " said the vicomte , sipping his port . " Miles , " said Martha suddenly , " how would you distinguish between the Corneillean will and the Racinian will ? There 're the same conflicts , in Corneille , between passion and duty , between the state and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet you could n't say that Corneille was Protestant . . . . " Warren 's head kept turning eagerly , back and forth , from face to face ; it made him feel as if he were watching a tennis match . " Well , " said Miles , cautiously , " in Corneille , I would say there was more feeling for power . It 's an imperial will , in Corneille , swelling out to world-domination . He wrote a Berenice too , you know . " " Maybe we ought to read that next , " proffered Warren conscientiously . " To get both sides  --  " " A Renaissance will , " broke in Martha . " The difference between setting an example , like Titus and Berenice , and dominating through your will , like the people in Cinna or the Cid . Je suis maitre de moi comme de l'univers . Je suis , je veux l'etre . ' Do you remember that , Dolly , from college ? " " I hated it , ' said Dolly , with feeling . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miles ? " persisted Martha . " And is n't there something else ? In Racine the conflict of passions is more internalized , within the soul of the character  --  his famous psychological realism . ' The soul , in Racine , is an arena , full of sinuous savage beasts leaping at thep183whip . " " Good Heavens , " said Harriet Huber . " Venus toute entiere a sa proie attachee , ' " quoted Miles . " If you remember your Phedre . The beast within . A thoroughly Protestant vision , I agree , Miss Lamb . " Dolly colored . " Love , in Racine , " pursued Martha , with a significant glance at Dolly , as if reminding her of some earlier conversation , " love is seen as a sort of diabolical possession  --  witchcraft . Poor Phedre . Racine made her a great heroine by giving her a bad conscience . It 's more sensual that way too . She hates herself and this passion that fastens itself on her , like a bird of prey . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged Warren . " I 'd like to hear what the rest of you think about the philosophy in there . " " Philosophy ' ? " questioned the vicomte . " There is no philosophy in Berenice . " " Warren means a philosophy of life , " said Martha . " Is n't it the same thing ? " protested Warren . " No , " said Miles . " Gee , I 'd like to discuss that with you , " said Warren . " Later , my boy , " said Miles . " Let 's stick to the subject . " " Well , but . . . " said Warren , hesitantly . He wanted to point out that no discussion could be worth anything if you did not go back and define your principles , but he could see the impatience in both Miles 's and Martha 's faces . He conquered his disappointment . " What I want to know , " he began , " is whether this play makes you as mad as it does me . It makes me want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Martha gently . " The way I see it , " said Warren , " that Titus is a prig and a hypocrite . He was no gentleman , if you 'll pardon my French . " " Why ? " said Dolly . " He was engaged to Berenice , darn it , " cried Warren , " and then he broke his promise to her , just for reasons of state . I call that pretty cheap . He owed it to her to marry her , when he 'd been engaged to her for five years . " " And she was n't getting any younger , " said Martha , with a laugh.  | " But his father died , dearie , " said Jane . " When he got to be Caesar , he could n't marry her , because of that old law . " " He should have thought of that before he got engaged to her , " Warren said hotly . " He knew the law and he knew his father was going to die some time . And it strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , " it strikes me Racine was pretty much of a faker not to have made that point in the play . If Shakespearewrote that play , he darn well would have showed what a son of a bitch Titus really was . " Miles looked at Martha , who looked at Dolly . Warren could tell from their expressions that they thought he had made a point . " You 're right in a way , of course , " said Martha finally . " Do n't you think so , Miles ? In a play by Shakespeare , Titus might have been shown up a little , like Prince Hal . It 's the same plot , really , when you think about it . A playboy prince and his boon companions . The education of a king . When the prince 's father dies , the prince , rather priggishly , sends his companions away . The rejection of Falstaff is n't too different from the rejection of Berenice , only in Racine it 's called renunciation . Probably Shakespeare , " she went on , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way things happen . One never knows , in real life , exactly how much self-interest or surfeit there is in these great renunciations . " " That 's all old stuff , " said Jane . " People do n't renounceany more , unless they 're compulsive or something . " " There was Kierkegaard , " said Warren . " I gave up my singing career for Harold , " observed Harriet . " Probably you wanted to anyway , " said Jane , candidly . " I mean , would you have given up Harold for your singing ? I 'll bet Prince Hal was bored stiff with Falstaff . He sounds just like some of the people around here . And I 'll bet Titus , underneath , was anti-Semitic . It says rightp185here in the play that he does n't want to get mixed up with Berenice 's Jewish relations . " Laughter shook the room . " Jane 's right , " said Warren , stoutly . " Act II , Scene 2 . Shall I read it ? " " We remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it , of Berenice 's blood , who married a slave or something ? " Warren nodded . " But that is n't anti-Semitism , Mr. Coe , " protestedDolly . " Something pretty darn close to it , " said Warren . " It shows what kind of a guy Titus was that he 'd listen to an argument like that . " Miles sighed . " Racine was n't interested in character , " he said . " You have to get that through your noodle . You ca n't judge him the way you do Shakespeare . Shakespearewas interested in politics and political types , which means he was interested in motive  --  the thing that makes people move , the way they do , in society . Underneath , of course , you 'll find the archaic patterns . The death of the father alters the Oedipal constellation ; the son , so to speak , intromits the father , swallows him , and assumes his primordial role . That 's what we see happeningunderneath the surface of both these plays  --  the Henry IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belated rejection of the mother , the feminine component , in Titus ; you see the same thing with Falstaff , whose relation with Prince Hal was suspiciously homosexual . " Jane adjusted an earring . " That 's what I always told you , " she said to Warren , who nodded sadly . " What about the death of the mother , Miles ? " inquiredHarold Huber . " That does n't have the same importance , " said Miles . " Not for the normal man , in his prime . The normal man outlives the mother while she 's still hale and hearty . It 's only in pathological instances that you find a son coming into manhood , finally , whenp186the mother passes on . " Jane sat picking at a spot on her skirt . For some reason , she kept staring at Miles 's shoes , which were black and very shiny looking , cut almost like a pair of slippers . " Still , Miles , " she said casually , " in our culture you 'll find a lot of fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's all commercialized , like Mother 's Day and Christmas ? " " Purely ritualistic , " said Miles . " Contrary to popular opinion , the mother does n't count in the American scene . I used to see it in my practice . She lives too damn long . Of course , there 's a certain amount of guilt among the descendants when they eventually get rid of the old girl . Half racial memory ; half social uneasiness . They think they 're expected to feel something . " There was a silence . If Warren was a fair sample , they were all thinking about Harriet , who was three times a grandmother and devoted to her two sons . " An angel just passed over , " she said brightly . " The angel of death , " said the vicomte , crossing himself . Harriet turned to him . " I was just reading an article , " she said . " By a Protestant minister . About how people are going back to religion . I never felt the need of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . " " Like all of us , " said Martha , sharply . " None of us , except the vicomte , are religious . " " But what about church attendance figures ? " ventured Harriet . " Are n't modern people supposedto be feeling a lack in their lives that they need religion to fill ? " Martha shrugged . " An advertising gambit , " she said . " First you convince people they lack somethingand then you sell them a product to remedy it . People need ' religion to deepen their awareness ' or give them tragic irony '  --  the way I need ' a facial cream to make my life more glamorous . " Warren felt a little embarrassed , on account of Paul ; if Martha were completely sober , she would not have flared up like that . " But ifp187there is a lack , Martha ? " said Dolly . " Then it ought not to be filled , " said Martha . " If it 's a real lack , it 's a necessaryhollow in life that ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortcoming . I do n't need God as a measure to feel that . Do you , Dolly ? " " God , no ! " said Dolly . " But you two are superior people , " said Jane thoughtfully . " Take the average person ; take Mrs. Silvia , my cleaning woman  --  " " I refuse that , " said Martha . " I am an average person . " Everybody laughed at the haughty air with which Martha said this . " Oh , come on , Martha , " said Jane , yawning and rearranging her hair . " We all know we 're superior to the ordinary person , mentally , anyway , and we all live more interesting lives . We do n't need religion ; we 've got books and pictures and music . We do n't have to go to church for spiritual stimulation . It 's just like in Rome ; Christianity was a slave religion . A person like Titus was above it , the way he was above marrying Berenice , because he was the Emperor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be a slave to love  --  that 's what the play is saying . " " But what about his promise ? " squealed Warren , anxious to get the conversationback on the main track . " Do you think some people are superior to promises ? " " Oh , Warren , " said Jane . " Promises in love do n't mean anything . Look at all the people who get divorced . " She clapped her hand over her mouth . Warren felt about the size of a pin . But Dolly rescued the situation . " It seems to me , " she remarked , " that there is n't any ought ' or ought not ' at issue in the play . It 's really taken for granted what Titus ought to do . The interest is in whether he can do it . " The vicomte nodded . " Quite right , " he said . " It is not a modern problem play . The standards are there , for Titus and Berenice ; no one in the play doubts them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . "  | " Conformity ! " Warren hopped on the word , which was the one he had been seeking all along , he joyously realized . " You 've put your finger on it , Paul , " he announcedexcitedly , waving his hand for silence . " That 's what I hate in this play . It 's all about conformity . The characters are a bunch of conformists . Berenice , for about two minutes , is a rebel , and then she throws in the sponge and conforms like the rest of them . " " But that is tragedy , my dear fellow , " said the vicomte . " The principalfigure learns to be sage . " " Not for me , it is n't , " said Warren . " Oh yes , " said the vicomte . " The old Oedipus , for example , has learned to be wise . " " To me , that 's just horror , " exclaimed Warren . " Oh no , it is n't , " said Harriet . Everybody , suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when a discussion got promising . Warren could hardly hear himself think . " Life is horrible , " said Harold Huber , dryly . " Oh no , it is n't , " cried Dolly . " It 's beautiful ! " " Oh , I know life is horrible , " Warren interrupted , with a happy smile . " I learned to accept that long ago . Everybody 's a bastard , including me and Jane . But that does n't stop me from being mad as all hell about it . " Every eye turned on him in bewilderment . " Excuse me , Warren , " said Harold , " but I do n't get you . What 's the argument ? If you 've learned to accept the facts of life , what 's eating you about Racine ? " Warren looked miserablyabout him ; nobody understood him , not even Jane . He caught Martha 's eye imploringly . " I see what he 's getting at , " said Martha , after a moment 's thought . " What Warren misses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Greeks you get bitterness and you get it again in Shakespeare . There 's acceptance without resignation  --  akind of defiance , in the end , like Othello 's last speech : ' I have done the state some service and they know't . ' There 's none of that in Racine  --  none that Ip189remember . The characters are too subservient to official morality , serviables , like courtiers . " Warren bobbed his head up and down , exultantly , in dumb show , while she was talking ; this , he presumed , was what he had meant to convey . Pleased with herself , manifestly , Martha smoothed back a vagrant lock of hair and sank back into her chair with a sigh . They had finished with Berenice . The conversation broke up into dialogues . Miles went to make himself a drink and brought Martha one . He sat down beside her . " That was fast work , " he commented , mopping his brow . Martha smiled at the tribute ; her face wore its mischievous look . " Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " between you and me , what is it they accept , d' you think , in the Greeks and Shakespeare ? Not a social code of morality or manners , as the Frenchies understood it . " Warren took a seat on the floor near them . " They accepted the way things are , " said Martha . " Inevitability . The way things happen , regularly . The laws of geometry of the universe . " " I 'll buy that , " said Miles . " There 's one big exception , " he added . " I know , " said Martha . " Hamlet . " " You think so too ? " inquired Miles with a genial start . He was always surprised , Warren had noticed , when anybody had the same thought he had . " In Hamlet , " Miles continued , " everythinghas gone screwy . No more laws . No more regularity . A ghost is masterminding the action , and nobody 's sure whether he comes from the good place or the bad place . In Hamlet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly head . Is Gertrude 's marriageunnatural or is n't it ? Is Claudius a villain or just the fall guy ? Is Hamlet crazy ? That question never gets settled . You can read it that he is crazy , like a lot of loonies that pretend to be mad , thinking that they 're fooling their keepers . Or you can read it the other way.  |p190Hamlet  himself is n't sure whether he 's crazy or not . He keeps pinching himself , like a person trying to find out whether he 's dreaming . That 's the famous doubt . " Marthasmiled . " I agree , " she murmured . " But does n't that open the question of whether Hamlet is really a tragedy ? Or a pathetic case history , which is what some actors make it seem ? " " Ummm , " said Miles . " Jones 's interpretation  --  toonarrowly psychoanalytic . Those categories are all right for the groundlings , but I do n't find them too helpful in my own thinking nowadays . If Hamlet 's just a neurotic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis in epistemology . If it 's clinical , it 's a case history in the annals of philosophy . A hero questions , for the first time , the whole apparatus of cognition . He sees differently from the normal ' people in the play , from his mother and old Polonius and Uncle Claudius and Ophelia . Is his vision distorted by the ghost 's revelations ? Should he trust the ghost or mock him ? And this doubt is involved with the whole epistemological puzzle , with how do you know what you know . " " Exactly , " cried Martha . " The mistrustfirst of our senses and then of our moral perceptions . That was what I was working on , for my doctorate , the history of that . The two mistrusts are related , as Kant saw when he tried to reorganize the whole subject : how much do we know and how ? " " I always said you had a head for philosophy , " observed Miles , blowing his nose . " The same thing in ethics , " pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do I know that I should n't murder a useless old woman ? Raskolnikov 's question was Kant 's question . " " Why should n't Raskolnikov ? " burst in Warren . " I 've often thought about that . Jane and I read it two years ago , and it seemed to us that Dostoevski stacked the cards at the end there . He never gives you a reason why Raskolnikov should feel sorry atp191the end . Raskolnikov was right , according to his lights . I would n't want to murder an old woman myself , but that 's probably because of the way I was brought up  --  my conditioning . Logically , there 's no reason . " " Logic does n't answerthose questions , " murmured Martha , with a side glance at Miles . " You have to start with a datum . Put the question the other way round . I would n't want to murder an old woman ; what are my reasons ? ' You 'll get further that way . " Warren rubbed his head in perplexity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pretty big assumption you make there . I mean , why should I assume that my own private preferences hold good for the rest of us humans ? I do n't want to murder old women , but some other fellow might be made differently . It seems to me you 've got to consider that . You 've got to give that fellow a reason . Do n't you think so , Miles ? " Miles looked down into his pleading eyes . " The electric chair , " he said . " That 's the reason we give him . " Warren felt deeply hurt ; Miles was only playing with him . " But you ca n't do that , " he protested . " You have to show him why you 're giving him the electricchair . " " He 's right , in a way , Miles , " intervened Martha . " You have to make universals . Behave so that thy maxim could be a universal law . ' I agree with Kant . " Miles frowned . " Kant 's effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said thickly . " For you , it 's an academic question . If you do n't want to murder old women , let it go at that . Do n't worry about the other fellow . Live selfishly . " A snort of laughter broke from him . Martha smiled too . Warren could see that she disagreed with Miles , but instead of arguing with him , she changed the subject . " He 's like Shaw , " she said to Miles , with a teasing look down at Warren . " A doubt-spreader . He wants to marshalthe logical reasons for every conceivable villainy , even though he himself would n't hurt a fly or touch ap192cup of coffee . That 's why poor Shaw could n't write a tragedy even when he tried . The tragic action turned into a discussion group , with everybody putting forward his point of view , for debate . Just like you , " she said to Warren , who was snuggled at their feet . " But is n't that what the Greeks thought , Martha ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Antigone this summer at the Arena Theater and , golly , it seemed to me , that all the characters were in the right there . Just like Saint Joan or Don Juan in Hell  --  we have that on records . I mean , everybody has his point of view . Creon is right , the way he looks at it , wanting to uphold the law , and Antigone is right , the way she looks at it , wanting to bury her brother . It 's awfully interesting if you compare that with Saint Joan , where Joan is right in her way , and the Archbishop , Cauchois , is right in his . If you compare the texts , you 'll see what I mean . " A happy thought struck him . He jumped up . " Let me just run out to the studio and get them , and I can show you . " " Sit down . We can remember , " Miles said curtly . " It 'll only take a minute , " pleaded Warren . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist . Warren complied . He knew Miles 's irascible humors and he was afraid that if he disobeyed him , Miles would be gone when he returned . " Tell me the difference , then , " he said , scrambling back to his place on the floor , by their side . " You tell him , Miles , " said Martha . " After you , " said Miles , with a courtly bow from the waist . " No , please , you do it , " cried Martha . " Well , " commenced Miles , " in Shaw , it 's a matter of logical demonstration . Each characterproves ' the validity of his position , sometimes by paradox , like Candida 's father . In Sophocles , it 's different , " he broke off , rather irascibly . " For God 's sake , War/ren , get me a drink . " Warren could hear them conferring as he fixed them both drinks . His conscience troubled him a little , for he felt they had both had plenty , but he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with liquor . " In Sophocles , Warren , " said Martha , when he came back , " the characters do n't set up a debate . They act . And it 's shown that action itself is ambivalent . An action like Antigone 's can be both right and wrong simultaneously  --  not right from her point of view and wrong from Creon 's but right and wrong absolutely , in the chain of consequences it sets off . Her brother gets buried , as piety demands , but her lover , Haemon , kills himself , as the result of her deed and its punishment . You can see it better with Orestes . Orestes 's action in killing his mother , Clytemnestra , was both right and wrong  --  enjoined on him by the gods and yet accursed . He had to purge the action of its wrong aspect by penanceand madness before reconciliation could take place , and the Erinyes become the Eumenides . Did it ever strike you , " she interrupted herself , turning to Miles , " that Hamlet is Orestes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness ahead of time , while Orestes kills his mother on credit and has to pay the bill in the sequel . In Hamlet , by the time Gertrude drinks the poisoned cup , all passion has been spent . " Miles laughed . " I always thought of Hamlet as an early bohemian , " he said . " A student , frequenter of actors , constantly philosophizing and living off his uncle . That 's why the poor devil could n't make anything happen , till the end , when he balled everything up and killed the wrong people . " Martha giggled . Warren had seldom heard such an interesting discussion , but he wished they would stay on the subject , instead of making fun of it . " What did you mean , " he said , hitching himself closer to Martha ,  | " about Antigone being right and wrong at the same time ? You mean she should n't have buried her brother if some innocent third party was going to suffer for it ? " Martha shook her head , rather crossly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she said . " She had to bury her brother . There 's no should or should n't . Or right or wrong , in the modern sense . There 's only the tragic perspective : the eye of eternity or the Greek measure of limit , which everybody oversteps , by a sort of fatality . Nobody can stay in the right  --  I mean in real life  --  that 's the terrible thing , Warren . If you think you 're in the right for more than a few seconds , you 'll find that you 're in the wrong . Nobody can have a permanent claim on being the injured party ; it seems horribly unfair , but there it is . As soon as you feel injured and begin to cry for justice , you discover that your position has gotten undermined ; the ground has shifted beneath you , in a slow sort of landslide , and you find yourself cut off . " " You mean you become unpopular  --  you 're talking about martyrs ? We see a lot of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . For some time , everybody had been listening to the conversation ; Martha 's tone had become rather dramatic and personal . From Jane 's saucer eyes and Dolly 's worried frown , Warren could see that everybody must be drawing the same inference he was : that she was alluding to herself and Miles . " Unpopular  --  thattoo , " said Martha . " Though that is n't what I meant . But it 's the same thing . You can joy in unpopularity , and that becomes evil too , very quickly . It 's another form of righteousness , of that fatal feeling that you 're triumphantly in the right . " " I get that fatal fe-e-ling , " sang Harriet Huber . Just then , the telephone rang  --  two longs and a short . Alarm crossed every face ; it was so late , after midnight.  |p195Warren  moved to answer it , but Jane , swift as an eagle , in her black shawl and black skirt , darted across the room and pounced on the phone before he could get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warding him off with her elbowwhen he tried to listen too . He was sure it must be bad news of some sort , but then her tall figure relaxed a little , and she motioned to Martha . " It 's John , " she announced . The others tried to make conversation while Martha talked , but Jane stood beside her , with a face of unabashed curiosity , taking in every word . " No , I 'm not , " Warren could not help hearing Martha protest . " Not very , anyway . Do I sound funny ? . . . Of course not . Dolly 's here . . . . All right , all right . Good-bye , darling . " " He says I sound tight , " she remarked , ruefully , to Jane . " Where is he ? " Jane demanded . " In Boston . " " In Boston ? " Jane stared . " You mean he 's spending the night ? " " Curiosity killed the cat , Jane , " observed Harriet . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha . " He 's at an all-night garage . He had to have the car fixed . " Jane seemed strangely concerned . " Why , he 'll never get back tonight , " she prophesied . " In all this storm . He should have started sooner . " " It 's only three hours , " said Martha . " Four , in this weather , " said Jane , dourly shaking her locks . " I 'll bet he stops for the night at one of those little road-places and does n't get home till noon tomorrow . He 'll be so exhausted he 'll oversleep . " Marthalaughed . " You do n't know John , " she said . " He 'll be here , a little after three . " But Jane continued to take a gloomy view . " He 'll probably have an accident , " she said . " Hurrying . On these slippery roads . " " Jane ! " said Warren sharply . She had always had a tendency to pry , which he accepted in her , because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that she might be a little demented . If so , it was his fault ; he was too ab/sorbed in his work and left her with nothing to think about but other people 's doings . " Calamity Jane , " chuckled Harold . " Why do n't you let Martha do the worrying ? He 's probably had a date with a blonde . " Jane recovered herself ; she shook her big body like a collie dog . " Martha 's a blonde , " she pointed out , in her practicalway . " A brunette , then , " emended Harold . Dolly rose . The good-natured Hubers seemed to bore her . " I 'll take you home , " she said to Martha . Warren 's heart sank . " Oh , stay , " he pleaded , offering her another glass of port . But Dolly was adamant . She was painting from nature , she explained , and had started a picture for which she needed the early morning light . " Oh , " said Warren sadly . He turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued . It was out of Dolly 's way to take her ; Dolly lived just over the dunes and Martha was on the other side of the peninsula . The Hubers would take her , when they returned Paul to the village . And she had not finished her drink yet . " I 'll take her , " said Miles , peremptorily . Martha hesitated , glancing from face to face . " A little longer , " she said nervously . " Are you sure , Martha ? " said Dolly , with a keen look into her friend 's brilliant , excited eyes , which veered away from her . " I might as well be hanged for a sheep , " said Martha , settling back in her chair . Warren beamed . " Wonderful ! " he said . " Gee , it 's funny you should say that , " he added , after a moment 's consideration . " What ? " said Martha . " About a sheep , " confided Warren . " Jane and I are going to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal . I knew I had something to tell you . Remind me when I get back . " He took the flashlight and led Dolly out ; Martha turned back to Miles.  |p197N  HOUR and a half later , he was making love toher on the Empire sofa in her parlor . She wouldnot let him carry her into the bedroom , where they could have done their business in comfort . Strainingat a gnat and swallowing a camel , as the Good Book said  --  that was milady Martha . He settled a small sofa pillow firmly under her hips , but the position was still not right . The sofa was too short and narrow and slipperyas the devil  --  covered with some horsehair material that was probably all the rage now . It groaned as his bare knees sought to get a purchase on it , and moreoverhe was cold . Their little house , which was pretty enough , did not have central heating , and the coal fire , glowing in the grate , cast romantic shadows over the white paneling without giving any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about 62  --  . There were no shades that could be drawn  --  only some white ruffled curtains of a thin material . He had turned the lights out when he had finally persuaded her to take her clothes off , but the fire illuminated the room so that anybody , looking in the window , could have seen their shadows , playing the beast with two backs , enlarged on the wall . Sinnott could not possibly be back for another hour and a quarter . Miles had looked at his watch , to check , before having at her , when he had downed his highball . He could have done without the drink , but Martha ,  |p198being  what she was , had had to go through the pretense of having asked him in for a nightcap , and they had wasted fifteen minutes , making polite conversation , looking over the house and admiring the big old fireplaces and the wide boards of the floors . He had been curious , as a matter of fact , to see how they lived : she was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , at once gay and austere ; he could see Sinnott'sinfluence in the number of art books scattered about and in the nice old Victorian sets in the white bookcases . He would have preferred , however , to prowl around on some other occasion , without Martha at his heels , explaining the history of everything . There was nothing here he could identify as belonging to the period of their marriage ; the few family things her mother had sent her , old Swedish stuff mostly , had gone up in the fire . Yet he had a queer sense of recognition . Some of the chairs , the wallpapers , the frying pans hanging in the kitchen , the wire lettuce basket , a violet cushion , all looked like old friends to him . She had built her nest again , like a bird , out of the same materials . It agitated him to see this . " You had this before , " he said , almost accusingly , picking up a little bronze Italian figure and turning it over in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed her , she admitted that she had had one something like it . As he stood in the kitchen doorway , watching her make the drinks ( he and Helen had a bar in the living room , with a vacuum jug that was kept full of ice cubes ) , her familiar tussle with the ice tray plucked at the strings of his memory . " Let me do that , " he said , when she started trying to open the soda water . He took the opener and the bottle from her , noting her quick flush of surprise . She was thinking , of course , that he had never helped her before . He followed her back into the parlor ,  |p199observing  the motion of her hips , which pranced a little as she walked , with short , incisive steps , in her high-heeled shoes . Up to that moment , he had not been sure whether he wanted to dally with her or not . But now the old Adam in him sat up and took notice . They were alone , hubby was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to examine a picture . She sat down on the sofa opposite him . There was one of those pregnant silences . He tossed off his highball , wiped his lips , took a quick look at his watch , and started across the room for her . She had struggled at first , quite violently , when he flung himself on top of her on the sofa . But he had her pinioned beneath him with the whole weight of his body . She could only twist her head away from him , halfburyingit in one of the sofa pillows while he firmly deposited kisses on her neck and hair . Her resistance might have deterred him if he had not been drinking , but the liquor narrowed his purpose . He was much stronger than she was , besides being in good condition , and he did not let her little cries of protest irritate him as they once might have done . The slight impatience he felt with her was only for the time she was wasting . She wanted it , obviously , or she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body , the twisting and turning of her head , filled him with amused tolerance and quickened his excitement as he crushed his member against her reluctant pelvis . He had no intention of raping her , and it injured him a little to feel how she pressed her thighs , which she had managed to cross , tightly together to protect the inner sanctum , when all he wanted , for the moment , was to hold her in his arms . Her hair slipped from its pins , and he seized the long tress eagerly in his hands , pressing his mouth into it and inhaling deeply . From the sofa pillow came a muffledp200cry of disgust ; when she turned her head , finally , to mutter " Stop , " he planted kisses on her cheek and ear . Breathing in the fragrance of her hair , nuzzling in her neck , he grew almost worshipful and ceased to hold her securely . Seeing this , she at once scrambled over onto her stomach and lay taut , as if waiting . Encouraged , he sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothes always bamboozled him  --  but she took advantage of his preoccupation to struggle up to a sitting position and began to push him away , with her small hands against his chest . She was wearing a high-necked black dress of thin wool ; he could see her small , full breasts , like ripe pears , straining against the material , and he bent down to taste them through the wool . But she would not permit this ; her hands sprang up , blockinghis approach , as he bore her down again . He kissed her white neck and the hollow of her throat , but whenever he tried to reach her mouth , she turned her head away sharply . He began to get the idea . The thing was to respect her scruples . She did not seem to mind if he kissed her arms and shoulders ; it was her breasts and mouth she was protecting , out of some peculiar pedantry . And yet she was not really frightened . She did not scream or try to hit him or scratch him , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not try to raise her skirt . The struggle was taking place in almost complete silence , as if they were afraid of being overheard . There was only the sound of their breathing and an occasional muffled " Stop " from Martha . They made him think of a pair of wrestlers , heaving and gasping , while taking care to obey the rules . A string of beads she was wearing broke and clattered to the floor . " Sorry , " he muttered as he dove for her left breast . He heard Martha laugh faintly as she pushed his headp201away from her tit . The humor of it was beginning to dawn on her , evidently . She was too ironic a girl not to see that one screw , more or less , could not make much difference , when she had already laid it on the line for him about five hundred times . His hunger for her now , when he was so well fixed up at home , was a compliment , which she ought to accept lightly . That was the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serieux lingering around the premises . They lacked a sense of proportion . But she was commencing to see it from his angle ; her struggles were becoming more prefunctory . " You want it , say you want it , " he mumbled in her ear . He was getting exasperated , foreseeing that he would be nervous during the act itself if she did not stop procrastinating . She shook her disheveled head and wrenched away from him , but just then he found her back zipper . He tugged , and the steel moved on its tracks ; the back of her dress fell open . He could feel her stiffen , as he moved his hand , carefully , under her slip , up and down her spine and over her smooth shoulder blades . He bent down to kiss her there , and she did not try to stop him ; her back , apparently , was not covered by the ground rules . She lay almost torpid , and he ventured to try to pull her dress off the shoulders in front . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to tear . She sat up in indignation , and his hand slipped in and held her breast cupped . " Take it off , " he urged , speaking of her dress in a thick whisper . " I ca n't , " she whispered back , as his other hand stole in and grasped her other breast . They began to argue in whispers . She mentioned Helen , the Goes , New Leeds , but not  --  and this was curious  --  her husband . " Please do n't , " she begged , with tears in her eyes , while he squeezed her nipples between his fingertips ; they were hard before he touched them ; herp202breath was coming quickly . She had caught his lower lip between her teeth , and there was a drawn look on her face , which meant that she was ready for it . " Stop , Miles , I beg you , " she moaned , with a terrified air of throwing herself on his mercy . " It wo n't make any difference , " he promised hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing , she let him slip her dress off her shoulders . He freed her breasts from her underslip and stared at them hungrily . Martha 's eyes closed and she took a deep breath , like a doomed person . " All right , " she said . Glancing at her wrist watch , she got up and took her dress off and put it on a chair while he hastily undressed himself and turned off the lights . But to have allowed this interval was a mistake . Women were funny that way  --  give them time to think and the heat goes off , downstairs ; he had often observed it . Now he found , once he had got well started , with her arms and legs where he wanted them , that she was no longer responding . She had a lot of will power and she had probably figured out , while she was undressing , that she would not " really " be unfaithful to Sinnott if she did not come to climax . Or else she had begun feeling remorseful . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , trying to give him a good time . But he could not really rouse her , and it took the heart out of him . He regretted the whole business before he was halfway through . He detected that she was trying to hurry him , which made him stubborn , though he was colder than a witch 's tit and anxious to get home . Her movements subsided ; her limbs became inert . It occurred to him , with a start , that she was actually very drunk , though she had not showed it especially . Compunction smote him ; he ought not to have done this , he said to himself tenderly . Tenderness inflamed his member . Clasping her fragile body brusquely to him , he thrust himself into her with short ,  |p203quick  strokes . A gasp of pain came from her , and it was over . She got up , staggering a little , and disappeared , with her clothes  --  into the bathroom , presumably . He dressed himself hurriedly by the fireside and stood , warming his hands , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound , except the gurgling of the fire ; in the stillness , the house seemed deserted . Alarm overtook him . He turned on the lamps and at once felt conspicuous , as if in a show window . The room had a sordid , disarrayed look . There were scattered beads everywhere and big bone hairpins ; the sofa had skewed around , out of position , and a small rug was caught in the casters . For two bits , he would have gone home , subito , but he was afraid to leave without knowing what had happened to her . It struck him that she might have passed out . He glanced at his watch and at the clock on the mantel , which had stopped , evidently forever , at a quarter of three . He remembered her talk at the Coes ' and he felt as if the eye of eternity were on him , as he paced up and down , irresolutely , smoking a cigarette . When he finished it , he said to himself , he would go and look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had cut her wrists or taken poison , in a fit of self-dramatization ? The veins stood out on his forehead . He was tempted , to make himselfscarce , while the coast was clear . He stamped out his cigarette , impatiently , and opened his mouth to call " Martha ! " in his peremptory baritone . But his vocal cords failed him ; he was afraid to make a noise . He waited a little longer . Just as he was at his wits ' end , she came back , wearing a pink dressing gown and a pair of slippers , with her hair , combed , down her back . This domestic image made him feel awkward and remorseful , like the sight of his mother in curlers and wrapper , waiting for himp204on the stairway of their Yonkers house when he had been out roistering with the gang . " Are you all right ? " he said , finally , staring into her pale face . Her eyes had turned black , like two big raw prunes , and she looked a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipstick on . She nodded , smiling faintly . He wanted to assure her , from the bottom of his heart , that what bad just occurred would never happen again , but he felt it would sound impolite to say so . " Good-bye , Miles , " said Martha gently . He could not make out whether that was meant to be symbolic or whether she was impatient to get him out of here . He took her hand and kissed her hastily on the forehead . " You 'd better clean this up , " he jerked out , with a blunt gesture around the room . Then he turned and beat it . But as he started down the hill to where his car was parked , he stole a look back at the house , and to his relief he could see her through the thin curtains moving about the parlor , busily straighteningup . Miles had not enjoyed it much either , Martha said pensively to herself , as she picked up the beads from the parlor floor . It had been like an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not really want . But she did not feel especially bad for what they had done . Now that it was over , it appeared to have been inevitable . She had thought it all out while she had been lingering in the bathroom , dousing her face in cold water to sober herself up and hoping that he would leave , so that she would not have to talk to him again . She had brought it on herself , she supposed . She ought not to have asked him in , knowing that it was a risk , even as they stood in her doorway . But it had been one of those challenges that she always rose to , like a fish to the bait  --  the fear of being afraid . And she still did notp205think that Miles had brought her home with the set purposeof seducing her . It had happened all by itself , invitus , invitam . In the end , he had done it , she reckoned , just because it was obvious ; it was a kind of strength in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it like a man at a free-lunch counter . She could not deny that she had asked for it , if only by her imprudence . Yet when he had first landed on her , she had felt like laughing . She could not take it seriously . All the while she was struggling , she had been suppressing a smile , at his ridiculous searching for her zipper ( he had never been able to find anything ) , at the blunt simplicity of his onset that took her consent for granted . Her chief worry , at first , had been that he would break the sofa . She had not been alarmed for her virtue , feeling certain that she could free herself once he grasped the sincerity of her objections . She was disgusted with him for slavering over her hair , but since she could not stop him , she resigned herself  --  that was the way he was , and his enjoyment could not harm her . This inability to feel outrage was of course her undoing . Even when her dress was open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or kicking him to keep him from exploring her back . Then , once he had touched her breast , she no longer , so it had seemed to her , had the right to refuse him . It was like that thing in law , where if you let somebody cross your property without hindrance , they finally secure a right of way . A drunken notion of equity had been heating at her mind , even as she pushed and parried  --  the idea that one more time could not possibly count and that she was being preposterous . And she still felt the force of this reasoning , even now , as she methodically filled the ice tray and carried it , spilling , across the kitchen to the icebox . The onlyp206thing that shamed her , looking back on the encounter , was the fact that her senses had awakened under Miles 's touch . She would have liked to blot out that part , which was only a minute or two , from her memory . But honesty compelled her to remember , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her expectant breast and languorous delight had possessed her , like a voluptuary . She made a face and proceeded unsteadily to the bathroom . But as she stood there , brushing her teeth , her sensuality relived those few moments , and she longed for John to come home . Disgusted with herself , she rinsed out her mouth and spat into the basin . Nothing , she thought angrily , could be more immoral than utilizingyour husband , whom you loved , to slake the desires kindled by another man , whom you detested . Moreover , her practical side added , she would be very unattractive to him in her present condition , still half-tight , swaying a little , and smelling of stale alcohol . He would be cross with her , anyway , for going to the Goes ' and getting drunk and seeing Miles again . And he would be right ; it could not have come out worse if he had predicted it himself . Misgivings overtook her . He would be bound to find out that Miles had driven her home . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tomorrow he might notice that there was an inch or so missing from the bottle of Scotch . She took three aspirins and drank two glasses of water , revolving the problem in her mind . She could say Miles had come in for a drink and made a pass at her , which was true enough but hard on Miles ; or she could say he had come in for a drink and not made a pass at her , which was kind but hard on John 's credulity . Or she could say that he had left her at the door and blame the missing whiskey , if John noticed it ,  |p207on  the handyman , who was notorious for taking liquor whenever he came into a house . Martha steadied herself on the wash basin and stared at her flushed face in the mirror . She would never have thought that she could entertain such wicked ideas even for a second . A shiver ran through her . She had not realized how cold the house was . Poor Miles , she thought , picturing his big white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to the drafts of the parlor . And it would be a miracle if she herself did not get sick from lying naked on the sofa in late October , with only a coal fire going . John would never forgive her if he knew of this piece of heedlessness . If she died , he would be furious and blame it all on the Goes . She smiled fondly , thinkingof John 's oddities , and hurried into bed . He liked to assign blame , arbitrarily , in military style . And he would be more annoyed if she caught cold than at any other feature of the seduction . Dear John , she said to herself . He would doubtless find a way of making New Leeds the villain of the whole episode , assuming she were to tell him . But she could not risk telling him , and precisely for that reason . Being intelligent and perceptive , he might forgive her and Miles and even see the absurd logic of it . But he would have to find some target for his stores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best thing would be to say that she had had Miles in for a drink and then gloss over the next part . If he asked whether Miles had made a pass , it would be wisest to say yes , just a little one ; if she denied it , he might doubt the whole story . The one thing to fear , aside from her getting a cold ( for which he would certainly hold the Goes ' play-reading responsible ) , was that he would discover that her jet-and-crystal necklace had been broken . He had given it to her , two years ago , for her birthday ,  |p208and  though it could be restrung , he would never feel quite the same about it , like the watch , which was a gift too . John had a peculiar attitude toward fragile , delicatethings  --  among which he included herself . He loved them angrily , foreseeing their destruction , and did not want them to be used , except on the highest occasions . This attitude always vexed Martha . It seemed to her somehow undemocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense , was what had got her into trouble tonight  --  withMiles , she could not treat herself as a preciousvase to be kept on a top shelf , like their Bohemianglass , which she insisted on using too . And yet look what had happened . Her dress was a wreck  --  she would have to mend it and iron it the next time John went away ; her necklace was broken ; she had started lying and deceiving and thinking of implicating the poor handyman . And she would probably have an awful hangover . She buried her head in the pillow and resolutely went to sleep . When she woke , it was daylight and the place beside her was empty . She came into full consciousnessinstantly and sprang up in bed , her heart pounding with terror . Her watch said eight o'clock . He should have been home five hours ago . She listened ; the house was silent . Not even the pump was running . Flingingoff the covers , she vaulted out of bed and sped in her bare feet across the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one there . A ringing scream came out of her . It smote her with utter certainty that he had somehow come home and seen them there through the window and quietly gone away forever . She tried to reason with herself . After all , she had looked at her watch before Miles turned out the lights , and it had been only a quarter of two . Nobody could have madep209it from Boston in that time . And she had looked again , at two-twenty , after Miles had left . John must have been killed in an accident . But her common sense refused to credit this . The policewould have called her . A hideous thought came to her . Perhaps her watch had been wrong . Suppose it had started losing more than its allotted twenty minutes a day ? And now that she thought about it , she could not remember setting it ahead yesterday morning , as she usually did , right after breakfast  --  the day had been upset with John 's leaving early . Another memory jogged her . When Warren came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she had not expected him so early . " Oh , my God ! " she heard herself cry . Her watch said eight-five now , but it might be much later . The clock in the parlor had stopped last week , when John tried to fix it himself ; he could not get the pendulum back right . She stumbled to the telephone . But the operator said : " I am sorree ; we are not allowed to give out the time . " She tried the Coes ' number ; it was busy . Dolly had no telephone , and she and John had no radio . Outside , it had stopped raining , but the gray sky did not reveal whether it was morning or afternoon . A peculiarinhibition checked her when she thought of calling the Hubers ; she did not know them well enough , she considered , to call them and ask them the time . She could call the vicomte and ask the time casually while ordering some liquor . She picked up the phone and set it down again irresolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps did not want to hear what time it was , for then she would know the worst for certain . The only thing that mattered was to find John and try to explain it all to him . But she did not know how to set about this . Her hand went out again to the tele/phone , but she shrank from calling the police . If he had been killed in an automobile accident , she did not want to know . The only course that seemed really feasible was to go back to sleep . Numbly , she started to the bedroom . Someone , eventually , would come and find her there , hiding under the covers . She got into bed and closed her eyes but opened them almost at once as another cry escaped her . " I ca n't stand it , " she moaned . And indeed it seemed to her that she could not endure anothermoment of existence . She began to sob aloud , as if from a physical pain . Unable to stay in bed , she wandered into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she knelt crouched by the hearth , weeping , she noticed that black and crystal beads were lying in the cracks between the floorboards and that two bone hairpins were in plain sight on the sofa . A strange relief swept through her . What if John had come home and seen this , she said to herself , forgetting that he had already , so she believed , seen everything . She poked out the beads and swept them into the dustpan , marveling at how tight she must have been last night to have presumed that she had cleaned them all up . And yet  --  as she now noticed for the first time  --  she did not have a hangover . She remembered reading somewhere that fear did something to your adrenalins and that pilots , during the war , never got hangovers on a flight , no matter how much they had drunk the night before . A wild laugh broke from her . What a price to pay for not having a hangover ! Just then , down the hill , she thought she heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , reluctant to look out the window , lest it not be he . In a moment , there was a knocking on the kitchen door . Nearly fainting , Martha went and pulled it open . It was only Jane Coe.  | " Where 's John ? " she demanded at once . Martha could not speak . She threw herself , sobbing , onto Jane 's bosom . " Gone , " she finally said . " Gone ! " Jane hurried into the bathroom and got a wet washcloth to wash the tears and coal dust off Martha 's face , which gave Martha time to recover herself . In the first instant , she had wanted to confess everything and be comforted , but now caution intervened . " What time is it ? " she asked huskily . It was quarter of nine , Jane said . Martha 's heart leapt with incredulous joy . Her own watch said eight-thirty . Therefore , therefore , she said to herself , her fears were groundless : he could not have seen anything . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured , and though , two minutes before , she would have felt this was the lesser evil , now this new horror struck her with redoubledforce . She moaned . " What happened ? Did you have a fight ? Why are n't you dressed ? " said Jane . " Or did n't he come home last night ? " Martha nodded , speechlessly , and burst into fresh sobs . " What did I tell you ? " said Jane . " He probably spent the night in some tourist place , just the way I said . " " No , " retorted Martha . " He would have called me . " Jane looked grave . " Have you called the police ? " Martha smiled sadly . " I was afraid to . " Jane herself called the police and the hospital in Trowbridge . There was nothing . But they were sending out an alarm , though Martha was not much use there : she could . not remember the car 's registration number or the year of the make . All she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was an old black Ford convertible . Jane put a pot of coffee on and made Martha dress . Then she told the news she had brought with her : Warren 's mother had died . He was off to New York this morning on the little plane from Digby , and thenp212on to Savannah , taking the afternoon plane . There was only one difficulty : he had no suit . " No suit ? " exclaimed Martha , from the bedroom , trying to take an interest . Only his corduroy , it seemed , and that , agreed Martha , fighting down her tears , would not do for a funeral , not in the South , anyway . You must think of others , she said to herself . Jane is thinking of you . And she put her mind on the problem . " Well , " she suggested , coming back into the kitchen , " when he gets to New York , he can take a taxi in from the airfield and pick up somethingoff the rack at Brooks Brothers . The fitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Jane did not take to this notion . She had had a better idea , it seemed . " What was that ? " said Martha , absently . Jane lowered her eyes . " That blue suit of John 's , " she acknowledged . Martha buried her head in her arms on the kitchen table and began to laugh hysterically . " It 's gone , " she gasped . " Is n't that ironical ? " Jane gave her coffee , and she grew a little calmer . " Is that why you came ? " she asked at length . Jane nodded . " Oh , dear , " said Martha . " Oh , dear . I 'm sorry . " She reflected . Actually , there was an old suit of John 's in the wardrobe , a dark gray , almost black , which he had never worn up here because it was too formal . The trousers were frayed at the bottom , but that would not matter , for Warren , since they could be turned up . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hanger . " Will this do ? " she asked . Jane could not hide her delight . It was perfect , she declared , examining it as it lay draped over a kitchen chair on its hanger . There would just be the sleeves and trousers to fix . " Take it then , " said Martha , wiping her eyes with a paper napkin . It occurred to her that she was a monster to be lending John 's suit this morning , but she could find noreason not to , except a superstition , and the idea , too horribly practical to contemplate , that he might need it to be buried in himself . The gruesomeness of this interviewwas making Jane uncomfortable , and it was not Jane 's fault , Martha pointed out to herself , that John had not come home . " Go on , take it , " she said . Jane hesi/tated . " He 'll be all right , Martha , " she said , with real kindness , patting Martha 's shoulder . " I know , " lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how brave she was going to be . " I ought to come and help you , " she added , uncertainly . This feeling was partly sincere . Jane needed somebody to help her get the suit ready ; one personcould work on the trousers and one on the sleeves . But she had expressed the wish aloud to show Jane that even in extremis she was capable of disinterestedness . If John were here , he would scold her for this . She could not help feeling that Jane was being selfish , as she watched her hurry down the hill with the suit over her arm . It never occurred to Jane , apparently , to offer to go and get Dolly , so that Martha would not be alone . Martha closed her eyes , waiting for Jane to be gone . She knew she was going to scream again , as soon as the station-wagon drove off . When she opened them , she saw their convertible . " JOHN ! " she heard Jane yell , and in a second there he was , climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did after an absence ; the knowledge that he was lovingly awaited made him matter of fact  --  he looked away , so to speak , from his arrival , as if it were a present he was bringing . He had spent the night , he told them , by the side of the road , in the car . The driving had been terrible , and he had been sleepy . He had not called Martha becauseevery place along the road was closed . He had not expected her to be silly and fearful , he added , tipping her chin . If he had known that , he would not havep214brought her a present  --  a white rose tree he had found for her at a nursery garden , next to the place where he had had breakfast . Martha studied him . He seemed rather strange and artificial , as he produced the rose tree from the car . If she had not herself had a bad conscience , she would have suspected him of being unfaithful . His story sounded very odd ( though like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be annoyed for the horrid suspensehe had caused her . Yet it was lucky ( if he only knew ) that he had not come home last night and found the mess in the parlor . Everything , indeed , about his returnwas fortunate , even the fact that Warren 's mother had died , for they all went off at once , with the suit , to the Coes ' house , where Warren was packing and putting away his painting things . John did not ask her about last night ; they were all too busy concentrating on getting Warren off on time . They tried the suit on him , and Martha shortened the sleeves and moved the buttons , while Jane did the trousers , which John then pressed with the steam-iron ; he did it better than either of the girls . With all these hands working , the suit was ready in an hour , which left fifteen minutes for Warren to stop in Digby and pick up some black shoes . They did not talk much , out of respect for Warren 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , who brought up the subject of the play-reading . He asked Martha whether she and Miles had had a chance to go on with the discussion . " No , " said Martha , shortly , busy with her needle . She heard the iron pause . " Miles took you home ? " John , in his shirtsleeves , his head bent over the ironing board , dropped the question casually . Martha , on the telephone , had promised him to go home with Dolly . Yes , she now acknowledged , in a slightly defiant voice ; and she had asked him in for a drink . " You asked him in ? " cried Jane , opening her mouth wide . " Why , you 're a nut ,  |p215Martha  . What happened ? Did he make a pass at you ? " They all turned their heads . Martha took her courage in her hands . " Of course not , " she said , smiling broadly . She held up the suit-coat and blushed . " Look at her , " said Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha . " Martha shook her head , stoutly . She put on a merry expression . " My lips are sealed , " she proclaimed . Warren , who was standing in his underclothes waiting to put on the trousers , had a grave , concerned look  --  what Martha called his jury face . But John let the matter drop lightly . " She does n't want to tell , " he said . " Martha is a gentle-man . " Afterward , in the car , on their way home , he asked her , with his eyes forward , on the road . " My lips are sealed , " she repeated , and added in a more serious tone , " Do n't ask me about it . It was nothing . For a minute , he misunderstood the invitation . One ca n't really blame him . " John nodded . They drove on in silence , but she could see that he was satisfied . She put her hand over his on the steering wheel . " Did you spend the night on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play-reading ? " " Maybe , " he said . " I thought so , " she replied . " But you 're not cross any more ? " " No , " he said . " But we ca n't have him dropping in all the time , " he added . Martha smiled . " He wo n't . " She did not understand why he had decided not to scold her , but she accepted it as final . Men were like that ; her father had been the same . They had tact at critical junctures , which was a sort of omniscience . And their mysterious decisions were final ; she would not hear any more about the play-reading unless she brought it up herself . She essayed another subject . " Was n't it funny  --  about the suit ? " she murmured . John laughed . " It was awful , " she went on , " when Jane came and I thought you werep216dead and I went and got out the suit anyway . It made me think of that poem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coat upon a coathanger . ' " She had not meant , by this , to reproach him , but he evidentlythought she had , for his hand reached out and gripped hers tightly , in commiseration.  |p217THE  FALL days known as " glorious " were over . Warren Coe 's mother 's death and the storm that accompanied it marked the annual break in the weather . A black frost followed , putting an end to Martha 's herbs and Dolly 's swamp foliage . There were no more fairy-ring mushrooms on the golf course or boletus in the woods . The sky clouded over by noon every day , and the wind whistled about the boarded-up summer cottages . The borders of the ponds grew sodden , with only a fringe of wild cranberry . The bay was gray and choppy . Blue jays and woodpeckers kept desolate house in the woods . It would be like this , said Martha , until May , though there might be days in late November when you could swim heroically in the ponds , and days , if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark afternoons , coming home to hot rum toddies and big fires . But in an ordinary year , there would be only a perpetualMarch , from the first black frost till the shadbushbloomed in May . Winter here was a limbo  --  a windtornparking area , closed shops and inns , vandalism , and divorces . Nearly everybody who could afford to got away , as the phrase went , after Christmas ; the rest stayed on creakily , like a skeleton staff . Already , in early November , the village had a forlorn , rejected look . The last permanent summer people had shut up their houses ;  |p218the  last canned luxury items disappeared from the groceryshelves ; the ferry from Trowbridge to the mainlandhad made its last run for the season  --  to get off the peninsula , you had to go all the way round . Town boys were breaking into summer houses ; police and caretakersmade their rounds ; mice came in from the fields and big rats from the dump . The fish-man from Digby stopped delivering ; the laundromat closed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the night . It was the best time of the year , Sandy Gray told Dolly : with the outsiders gone , you finally got the feel of the place . He had been opening scallops , along with the native women , getting $1.50 an hour . Next month , he was going to decorate bureaus for the New Leeds Craftsmen , on a cooperative basis . In January , he would start work at the fish-storage plant , over at North Digby . He was not doing this for the pay check but for the sake of the kids . With the custody case coming up and their whole future at stake , he had pocketed his principles , temporarily , and put himself in the hands of his lawyer , who told him to find a job and make his peace with society . On the advice of his lawyer , too , he had shaved his beard and had his hair cut . First things first , he told Dolly , who regarded these changes with bewilderment . Would you hire a doctor to save your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked you better the way you were , " she said doubtfully . " That 's because you 're afraid of change , " he explained , in his gentle , gusty voice . " The true individualist has the courage to wear a mask . " When she came in her jeep to pick him up the morningthe case was scheduled , he was wearing a leather jacket , a pair of dark trousers , and a white silk eveningp219scarf wrapped about his neck in lieu of a necktie . His lawyer , he said , had warned him to appear on time at the courthouse in Trowbridge , in conventional dress , and to see that his witnesses did the same . Dolly 's costume Sandy had chosen himself from her closet  --  an unbecominggray tweed suit she had had made up in England . But it worried him that she had no hat . All the way down in the jeep , he kept fuming with impatience and cursing the stop lights and the midmorning traffic in the villages . The judge , he reminded her , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the docket . " We have plenty of time , " she shouted , repeatedly , over the noise of the jeep . His fretfulness alarmed Dolly . This was not the Sandy she knew . The loss of his beard had done something strange to him . Whenever she glanced at him , sideways , she had a sense that she was intruding . At the same time , she could not help noticing that his chin was recessive . She was going to be a character-witness for him . How this had come about she scarcely knew now . How could she testify to his character when she had been in New Leeds exactly one month ? But it was not the length of the association but the frequency that counted , Sandy had assured her . For the past two weeks , she had been with him every day . She had ridden pillion on his motorcycle and washed his hair in her basin and helped him deliver furniture , down the peninsula , for the New Leeds Craftsmen . They had gone to see Miles Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of Martha , and they had taken a bottle to call on Sandy 's fourth wife , to persuade her to testify . They had been sharing a Sunday paper and doing the crosswordstogether . The fact that she had come here as a stranger , said Sandy , would make her testimony morep220impressive . She had no axe to grind , and the judge would see at a glance that there was no sexual involvement . It was true ; there was nothing between them . His second wife , Ellen , was coming back in December ; he talked about that constantly , when he was not talking about the children and Barney , his lawyer . Her return , he said , could only mean one thing  --  she wanted him back . Her second husband had finally made a settlement on her , so that she was free now to remarry . Sandy was fixing up his house , to be ready for her ; Dolly had been with him to buy curtains and look at some linoleum for the kitchen . He had even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in heat , which he could pay for by selling some pond frontage to a developer . His excitement touched Dolly almost painfully . She had never been so close to a man , on the one hand , or been so disregarded , on the other . After the first day , he never even glanced at her paintings ; as soon as he got to know her , his abrupt honest mind had simply dropped the idea that she could ever do anything serious . And after his first enquiries , he paid no heed to her sex . It never occurred to him , apparently , that Dolly could be jealous , or sad that their relationship would end when this " real woman " came back . He never considered her feelings , which made Dolly feel safe with him , though somewhat depreciated , like a thin dime nestling in his pocket , while he reckoned his future in gold . And yet it was wonderful  --  upsetting and enlightening  --  to be treated so objectively . Being with him , she had decided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget the you . But now , as she climbed the courthouse steps , looking up at the huge granite columns of the neo-classic front , she felt as if she were awakening from a dream . She had a slight hangover , and her eyes , which had sunk backp221into her head , had a bleary glazed look ; she kept blinkingthem to focus on her surroundings , as if she had been playing **26;8470;TOOLONG . It was the first time she had had any contact with the law , and the courthouse , with its Civil War cannons , inspired her with terror . It belonged in a dark mill town of the nineteenth century  --  the kind of town she had been born in . Her sense of proportion protested at its presence here , overlookinga village green , a general store , and a double row of clapboard cottages , advertising rooms for tourists , home-made jellies , and sea-captain 's chowder . " Probate court " they were going to , and the very name evoked her childhood , her two aunts , wills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up and her hands thrust in her pockets , she stood under the portico , alone , takingno notice of the other people passing in and out , her eyes smarting with tears from the bitter wind . Sandy had hurried inside , to confer with his lawyer . When he came out and joined her , lighting his pipe , he was in jubilant spirits because his ex-wife , Clover , was late . Everybody else  --  the two lawyers , the witnesses  --  was present and accounted for , inside the gray building . Clover 's lawyer was pacing up and down the corridor and telling Sandy 's lawyer that he had half a mind to throw the case up . She had missed the morning bus , it seemed , and somebody had called the clerk of the court to say that she was hitchhiking . Her ex-stepmother  --  one of the old-timers here  --  was trying to calm the lawyer down by explaining Clover 's character . Sandy 's lawyer was very hopeful ; he had finally got an affidavit from the New Leeds dentist about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been feeding them on candy bars and cookies  --  too lazy to open a can . Dolly put her hands to her ears . She did not want top222hear any more . It was all true , no doubt ; Sandy had convinced her . But these dreadful details , hammered home , had the effect of dividing her sympathies . " Why should n't she hitchhike ? " she said suddenly , in a clear stubborn voice . " My dear , I do n't mind , " said Sandy , smiling . " It 's what the judge will think . Hitchhiking is illegal in this state . " " But she ca n't word a taxi , " argued Dolly , striving to be composed and reasonable . " She should have thought of that before she missed the bus , " Sandy replied . " Everybody else got here . It 's no good feeling sorry for her . We 're all sorry for her ; we 've all tried to help her . She 's a tragic kid , really  --  a natural delinquent ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leopard ca n't change its spots . " He turned up Dolly 's coatsleeve and glanced at her watch . " Look , " he said softly . " There she is now . " On the highway below them , a Nehi truck had stopped . Two children and a woman clambered out , waving to the driver . " Watch ! " said Sandy , gripping Dolly 's arm , as the boy and girl raced across the road , without looking either way to see whether any cars were coming . " I wish the judge could have seen that , " he added , when they had safely crossed the road , followed by their mother . An afterthought struck him . " You saw it ! " he cried , elatedly , tightening his hold on her arm . " Put it in your testimony . I 'll tell Barney to ask you about it . " " I could n't , " said Dolly faintly . Sandy had made her believethat she would not be harming Clover if she merely testified to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be character-witnesses on her side , and he did not hold it against them . But now he wanted her to go further , and he dropped her arm impatiently when she tried to explain that she could not magnify this little incident on the road into criminal negligence.  | " I know , I know , " he said . " You do n't want to take sides . ' " Hurt , Dolly made her way into the building ; the court was sitting on the second floor . " Barney " had told her where to go , but she took the wrong staircase and got lost . She hated the lawyer and the effect he was having on Sandy . He kept warning Sandy that the courts favored the mother , and that Sandy would lose the case if he did not " get in there and fight . " He had been very short with Dolly , when Sandy had brought her to his office , to be rehearsed in her testimony . As soon as he heard that she had known Sandy only a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sandy had given him the impression that they had known each other before . When Dolly said no , firmly , he shot her a peculiar look and suggested that they might have known each other " in the big city . " " You being a painter and him being an art critic , it would stand to reason that you 'd met . " " No , " Dolly had repeated , loweringher gaze . " I 'm afraid your testimony wo n't be of much help then , " he said irritably , shutting up a folder . " I told him that ! " cried Dolly , indignant . " Oh , well , " sighed the lawyer . " Let 's take down what you 've got . You never know what the judge will stand for . Unmarried , I take it , " he said , pulling a pad of yellow paper to him . Contempt for her scruples , Dolly felt , underscored those last words and the measuring , smooth look that accompanied them . He diagnosed her , she inwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like beingunmarried , like , if he only knew it , her dainty , faintheartedcanvases stacked against the wall , unfinished . She began to feel guilty , as though she had to explain herself . He wanted to know what she was doing here , out of season . Mentioning the Sinnotts , Dolly flushed.  |p224Because  of Sandy , she had hardly seen them since the play-reading . She did not dare think what they would say if they knew she had let herself get involved in the custody suit . " Sinnott ? " said the lawyer . " Oh yes , the girl in the nightgown . She 's back again , I hear . " Dolly nodded . " Come to think of it , you look kind of alike . Same type . " " We went to college together , " murmured Dolly , as if in extenuation . " Uh huh , " said the lawyer , writing . By the time she left the office and joined Sandy outside , on the motorcycle , she felt she had done wrong not to stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened , saying that she was sorry , he wearily cut her oft . " Why should you lie for me ? " he said . " Barney did n't expect that . It was just a misunder-standing . " A janitor showed Dolly into the courtroom . Another case was being heard . She settled herself on a bench and peered around . On her left , at a little desk , was a man in a blue uniform with a star . High up , on a platform , at a long table , was the judge , a long-nosed man in a black robe , like a college professor 's . The witness stand , at his right , was empty ; the judge was whispering with two men , who , Dolly presumed , were lawyers . On the far side of the room , by the window , stood Barney , looking out . " Divorce case , " a man next to Dolly informedher . When the testimony resumed , and a big black-haired woman took the stand , nobody paid any attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing in and out , in desultory style , rather , Dolly thought , like tourists in a European church , where a droning mass was being said in one of the chapels . The proceedings seemed very lifeless ; she had to strain her ears to catch what the witness was saying , in a monotone , like a lesson learned . It was a case , ap/parently , of wife-beating . " Two beautiful big black eyes , " she heard the witness intone , and the lawyer picked up the phrase and repeated it , like a chant . Then , before Dolly knew it , the case was over , and the man in the blue uniform was calling their case : Alexander Gray against Clover Gray . Nearly everybody in the courtroom moved forward , past a brass railing , and Dolly moved with them and took her seat on a wooden bench at the right . Sandy was not yet in the courtroom , and all these people , at first glance , were strangers to Dolly . She found herself sitting next to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sombreroon his knees . Across the room , to her surprise , she recognized the milkman , in a pink shirt and Windsor tie . The courtroom door swung open , and Clover saunteredin , accompanied by a small gray-haired man with a briefcase . She had little bright blue eyes , like Christmastree bulbs , lit up . Her brown hair was pulled up in a horse 's tail , with a big plaid ribbon tied around it . She had on a great deal of rouge , and her lipstick had come off on her front teeth . She wore an old , shapeless winter coat , red knee socks , moccasins , and a plaid skirt and vest . The skirt was much too big for her , and to Dolly 's eyes , she looked pathetically unreal , like a child painted up and dressed in adult clothes to beg on the street at Thanksgiving . The two children had disappeared . She was walking straight toward Dolly , who lowered her eyes and laced her fingers on her lap . " Are n't you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep husky voice . Dolly started and looked about her in perplexity . " You 're his witness , are n't you ? " said Clover . " These are my witnesses . " Dolly reddened and jumped up , dropping her pocketbook . The uniformed man , the sheriff , was hurrying toward her . Somebody handed herp226her pocketbook . The whole courtroom stared while Dolly changed places . She stumbled into a seat at the end of the front row , by the witness stand , while across the room Clover took the seat she had vacated . The two " teams " of witnesses , facing each other , made Dolly think of a spelling bee or a give-away program on television . She could not imagine where they had come from , where the lawyers had found them ; they were like professional mourners , too , or like floaters rounded up to vote in an election . She could not remember seeing any of them , except the milkman , before . But gradually she began to recognize faces . At the end of the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Margery , the girl who worked in the grille . Across the room , on Clover 's side , was the oysterman . Next to him was one of the New Leeds Craftsmen ; Dolly had not known him , with his hair combed and a shave . All of them were transformed for the occasion ; that was what had confused her . In their ordinary gear , she had been seeing them every day at the post office or the First National check-out . But now they wore " city clothes " or , to be exact , parts of them . One man had on striped trousers over bare feet and sandals ; another had a necktie and pearl stickpin with a pea jacket . Ancient waistcoats , long earrings , tarnished metal blouses , old fur pieces , a gold watch chain with a Phi Beta Kappa key , velvets , nodding plumes , a motoring veil , proclaimed the community 's notion of a solid respectable front . The man next to Dolly wore a white suit , like Mark Twain . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather bedroom slippers . It was the same all along the row : an uneven satin hemline ended in bare legs and tennis shoes ; a black tailleur , in a set of espadrilles . A kind of defiance , evidently , had set in with the feet , which refused to render unto Caesar.  |p227A  strange smell rose from the witnesses  --  a combination of stale alcohol and mothballs . Dolly could still taste last night 's liquor on her own breath , and she wondered whether these perfumes could be wafted up to the judge . Just below her , near the sheriff 's desk , sat a small woman in a plain suit , with a notebook and briefcase . The man next to Dolly leaned over . " S.P.C.C. , " he whispered , cupping his mouth with one hand while his elbow nudged Dolly in the ribs . " S.P.C.C. , " he repeated , opening his red-rimmed eyes very wide . Dolly stared miserably at the network of empurpled veins in his cheeks . To her horror , she had begun to feel ashamed of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an outsider  --  the caseworker , the judge . Nearly all of them seemed the worse for drink , swollen and dropsical , or lean and red , with popping eyes and stiff veins and shaking hands . Several of the men had bits of dried blood on their faces , where they had cut themselves , apparently , while shaving . One young man  --  he could not have been more than thirty  --  had stone-gray hair and a face as white as leprosy ; his arm was in a sling . And yet they were all in good spirits . It was only she who was depressed and self-conscious . Dolly could hear them discussing the judge . " He always favors the woman , " said a young man in a corduroy coat and turtle-necked sweater . " I had him when Carol divorced me . " " You 're wrong , darling , " said an old woman in slacks. had him and he cut off the maintenance . " A woman with dyed red hair and a face like a monkey suddenly addressed Dolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head ; she had never met this person , who seemed to be drenched in the perfume called Femme . " I 've seen you in the liquor store , " the woman went on . " I 'm a friend of Paul 's . Do you know what happened to me last year ? They brought me into court forp228lowering the birth rate . " Dolly looked perplexed . " I ran into a car carrying three pregnant women . They all had miscarriages and sued me . " The woman 's voice was loud and laughing . The caseworker looked up and frowned . Dolly reddened . " I 'm a sort of jinx , " her new friend continued . " Last year , a man dropped dead on my sofa . I thought he had passed out . " Sandy slipped into the seat next to Dolly . He had been talking with the children . " She has them coached , " he said angrily . " Her lawyer 's got it rigged up for them to talk to the judge in chambers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damn if he hears , " Sandy muttered , lowering his voice . " She has no right to bring the kids into a thing like this . It 's criminal , having their feelings pawed over . ' Do you love Mother best or Daddy ? Come on , tell the Judge . ' Imagine what that will do to them twenty years from now . " He sat back with an air of dark satisfaction , then jumped up , in response to a signal from Barney , who had been talking with Clover 's lawyer by the window . Dolly rubbed her forehead . He was right , she thought remorsefully ; such a decision was horrible for a child . " They want to make a stipulation , " volunteered the man in the white suit , nudging Dolly again , to direct her attention to Sandy , who seemed to be arguing with his lawyer . " What 's that ? " said Dolly , uneasily ; she could see that Sandy was getting worked up , by his gestures . " The lawyers get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly , " and try to agree to shorten the testimony . Clover does n't defend , and they fix it up with the judge to award divided custody . They always try to pull that . " The man in the white suit nodded . " But would n't that be the best thing ? " timidly suggestedDolly . " After they 've got us all down here . . . ? "  |p229said  the man in the pea jacket , looking at his watch . " If they do n't start soon , damn it , I 'm going to step out for a drink . " " Oh , please do n't , " cried Dolly . " The town 's dry , Jack , " said the man in the white suit . " Local option . " The man in the pea jacket settled back on the bench . " Oh , it 's all a farce , " declared the man in the white suit . " We 're all wasting our time . We come down here to be nice , to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? I do n't . I 'm just a character witness . You too ? " Dolly nodded . " I do n't judge between ' em , " said the man , dropping his voice , as Sandy started back to his place . " In my opinion , the best thing would be to give the children to the state . Let the town bring ' em up . The town spawned ' em , you might say . " " Barney 's sore , " reported Sandy , sitting down . " He wanted me to compromise . " " And you would n't ? " said Dolly . Sandy shook his head . All at once , the courtroom grew quiet . The judge sat up , under the American flag ; a woman ( the assistant registrar , said Dolly 's neighbor ) took her place at the other end of the judicial bench , under the state flag . Spectators tiptoed into the rear benches . The first witness was being sworn : Mrs. Mary Viera , a cleaning woman who worked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a small , black-eyed person in a dark suit and white blouse  --  the only **25;8498;TOOLONG , thought Dolly , in the whole array of witnesses . Her English was surprisingly broken , and she had a voice queerly pitched , like a parrot 's . She worked , it seemed , occasionally for Clover , and she testified to the state of the house , on the days when she came to clean . It was very dirty , she agreed , under Barney 's questioning . Cat pee ( " Excuse me , Mister , " ) in the corners ; children 's beds dirty ; food stuck on the table ; food on the walls ; icebox dirty , food with beards inside ; grease burned on pans ; dog food all over , onp230floors , no vacuum cleaner ; old smelly mop ; no light bulb in toilet . Dolly tried to shut her ears . She hated Mrs. Viera , with her spying black eyes . The man in the white suit cupped his mouth . " Worst damn cleaning woman in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dolly . Sandy frowned . He was following the testimony intently , leaningforward and nodding as Mrs. Viera spoke . Bottles , yes , bottles everywhere ; garbage spilled outside ; childrenbarefoot . The S.P.C.C. woman was writing in her notebook . A pair of spectators moved closer , and Mrs. Viera , obligingly , raised her parrot-voice . Barney 's voice , prompting , had a smooth , smiling tone . " And what about this fellow that lives there ? " To Dolly 's surprise , Mrs. Viera became guarded . " What fellow ? I do n't know . " " Oh , come on now , Mrs. Viera , " Barney said impatiently . " You know there 's a man living there . The whole town knows it . " Clover 's lawyer rushed in with an objection . The judge leaned forward . " Is there a man living with Mrs. Gray or not ? " he said to Clover 's lawyer . " Does your client deny this ? " Everyone looked at Clover . " We do n't deny it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that he is a payingguest . " Barney took a step backward ; the judge raised his eyebrows ; even Clover 's witnesses appeared to take this as news . Sandy half-started to his feet , but Dolly pulled him down , by the leather jacket . " Proceed , " said the judge , rapping lightly with his gavel . " Have you seen this man there ? " Barney demanded of Mrs. Viera . " Sometimes . " " Where does he sleep ? " Mrs. Viera did not know . She was asked to describe the layout of the house . There were two bedrooms , a living room , a kitchen , and a little room , with a couch in it . " Maybe he sleep there , " she volunteered . Barney frowned . Had shep231ever , he wanted to know , seen that couch made up , with sheets on it ? No , agreed Mrs. Viera , but most of the times she had been there , the fellow had been away ; he worked , she had heard , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's changed her testimony , " he whispered angrily . " They all do it  --  these damned Portuguese . You get them in the courtroom , and they get scared . " " Where does he keep his clothes ? " said Barney . Mrs. Viera did not know . I-lad she ever seen his clothes in Mrs. Gray 's bedroom ? The courtroom seemed to catch its breath while Mrs. Viera reflected . She was not sure , she answered finally . Barney protested : this was not what she had told him when he came to her house to talk to her . " What do you mean  --  not sure ? " he said in a hectoring tone . " Not sure , " mumbledMrs . Viera . Sandy 's witnesses looked wonderingly at each other . The judge intervened . It was an importantquestion , he said , and she could help the court clear it up . She must try to search her memory . " No good , Judge , " said Mrs. Viera , simply . " When he "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , he ask me if I ever see man 's clothes in Mrs. Gray 's bedroom . I say yes . " " Well ? " prompted the judge . Mrs. Viera grinned . " But Mrs. Gray wear man 's clothes herself  --  man 's shirt , pants , old coat . This the first time I see her in skirt . " Laughter shook the courtroom , led by Mrs. Viera . " And is that why you 've changed your story ? " Barney demanded sternly . " My daughter explain me my mistake , " said Mrs. Viera serenely , turning to the judge . " She tell me I not understanding questions . " " You mean , " said the judge , " that you sometimes saw men 's clothes in Mrs. Gray 's bedroom , but you are not sure , now , whose they were ? " Mrs. Viera nodded . " Maybe hers . Maybe his . " Barney mopped his brow . Surely she knew the difference , he insisted . But Mrs. Viera wouldp232not be budged . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gleeful look at the judge . When Clover 's lawyer 's turn came , he started on a fresh tack . He asked Mrs. Viera how long she had lived in New Leeds and how many residents she had worked for and whether she kept a clean house herself . " Oh yes , " said Mrs. Viera proudly . " I believe you , Ma'am , " said Clover 's lawyer , who spoke with a slight southern accent . " But now tell me . The conditions you describe in Mrs. Gray 's residence  --  are they unusual ? " Mrs. Viera looked puzzled . " I mean the dirt on the floors , the dog food , the moldy icebox , and so on  --  do you often see these things when you come to clean for your ladies ? " Mrs. Viera brightened . " Oh yes , " she said happily . " All the time . All the time . Summer people too . Everybody live like that here in America . Like pigs . " There was a movement of recoil on the benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stars and Stripes . " Watch what you 're saying here , " the judge commanded , sharply . " You do n't mean everybody . " " Everybody I working for , " explained Mrs. Viera . " Not poor people  --  Portuguesepeople , Finnish people , Yankee people . They keep clean house ; do n't have cleaning woman . " She appeared to search for her meaning . " Rich people , college people , famous people , lawyer , writer , painter  --  just like Mrs. Gray . Live like bootlegger . " Another laugh rose . " I think she must mean me , " giggled a woman in Dolly 's row . " She 's pathological , " said another woman , with bitter emphasis . " I would n't have her in the house . " The judge rapped for silence . " Have you ever worked for Mr. Gray ? " continued Clover 's lawyer . Mrs. Viera shook her head . " But Mr. Gray just the same . I have friend who tell me  --  " The judge cut her off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen yourself , " he told her . " I do n't know what this testimony proves , " he went on , inp233tones of irritation , to Clover 's lawyer . " The general standard of living that prevails in New Leeds , " the lawyerwent on , undaunted . " I 'm trying to set Mrs. Gray 's housekeeping in its context , your honor . Many of the older ladies here , in our permanent winter colony , are famous housekeepers , but the breed is dying out . Other times , other customs . " " Proceed , " said the judge . " Would you say that Mrs. Gray was a good mother ? " Clover 's lawyer asked Mrs. Viera . " Kind , considerate , thoughtful ? " Mrs. Viera scratched her head . " Mrs. Gray very nice woman . Very friendly . Good mother , I do n't know . " She turned to the judge . " It 's the same like I was saying , Judge . All the women I work for , not like poor women . Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not paying attention . Not mending clothes , ironing , fixing hair , cooking , sendingto church , sending to Sunday school . Listen to radio , ' Go away and play now . ' Open can . Here , eat . ' Mrs. Gray , I think , have big heart , play with the kids , cut out magazines , draw pictures , play the guitar to them , sing . But not careful for kids . Not worrying . " " Do you think a worrying mother is a good thing , Mrs. Viera ? " demanded Clover 's lawyer . " Sometimes , " she said , turning thoughtfully to the judge . " I do n't talk so good in English . What I mean , Mrs. Gray not bringing them up , not teaching , not feeding right , not putting to bed  --  " " And all your employers are like that ? " cut in Clover 's lawyer . " Oh yes , " beamed Mrs. Viera . " Oh yes . " Dolly 's head was aching when they went across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit with them ; most of the other witnesses , on their side , had finished their testimony , and gone off to eat at the hotel in the next township , which had a cocktail lounge . Dolly 's testimony , Barney said , was going to be veryp234crucial , as things were shaping up . Mrs. Viera had turned the whole case upside down . There was nobody else who could swear that this truckdriver actually slept with Clover  --  nobody but the children , who would probably not be asked in chambers , unless the judge could find a way of doing it delicately , by indirection . And Clover had undoubtedly warned them not to tell what they knew . " Oh , it 's all so ugly , " sighed Dolly . She half-agreed with the man who said it would be better to hand all the children of divorced people over to the town . " Human nature , " said Barney , munching on a hamburger . The trouble was , he continued , that you could never get the natives up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clover never drew a shade , but her neighborsdown by the bay acted as though they were blind if you tried to get an affidavit out of them . The ones who were willing to talk always turned out to have a screw loose , like Mrs. Viera , or like the milkman , who was stage-struck and saving up to go off to drama school . The kid loved to testify , but he would only describe the state of the kitchen when he brought in the milk in the mornings . He swore that he 'd never looked in the bedroom window , though he walked right past it every morning . " I mind my own business , ' he says , with a flounce of his tail . " " I do n't see why you have to bring sex into it , " Dolly said suddenly . " I do n't think Sandy ought to do that when he believes in sexual freedom himself . You 've got plenty of evidence to show that she 's a bad mother . Why worry about proving immorality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to hear about , Miss Lamb , " retorted Barney , reaching for the ketchup . " Besides  --  let 's be frank  --  the S.P.C.C. has a record on Sandy . All right "  --  he raised a hand to forestall Sandy  --  " I 'll agree . That was different . That was a health fad . You kept the kids barefootto develop their feet . And you did n't toilet-trainp235them , to develop their character . And you fed them on peanut butter because of something you read in a book . But the court looks at the record , damn it . " " You know what happened , " said Sandy , in a low voice , to Dolly . " The boy went to school barefoot , and the other kids threw knives at his feet . The teacher had the S.P.C.C. after me . There 's an irony for you . It was those ruffians and their parents that ought to have been investigated . " Dolly gave a gasp of pain . " But you went right on sendinghim , " protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . " " How did I know ? " cried Sandy . " The teacher sent a note . Please put shoes on Michael . ' Nobodygave me the reason . I 'd taught Michael to be brave and he would n't squeal to me on his little classmates . I was damned if I 'd put shoes on him , just to appease the local bourgeois . " He banged his knife down on his plate . " Easy , boy , " said the lawyer . " We do n't want you making speeches to the judge . You used to be a Red , remember ? " " Clover ca n't use that , " declared Sandy . " She was in the Party herself . I broke long before she did . Miles got me out of it during my analysis . He showed me I was really an anarchist . " Barney laughed . " Oh , balls , " he said . " You 're a property-owner and a registered voter . But do n't forget : there 's a lot of hostilityto you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old Viera 's testimony . She was getting her own back , after all the stinking messes she 's cleaned up for you geniuses . Now , Miss Lamb , " he said , picking up his bill and a toothpick , " when I call you to the stand , speak up . We want the judge to hear you . And do n't be afraid of stressing what you 've got to tell . Let it ring out . We want to make the court realize that Sandy 's turned over a new leaf . Describe what you 've seen yourself  --  the things a woman notices . Is the house clean ? Can Sandy cook ? Doesp236he wash the dishes ? Is he neat , methodical ? Does he drink ? Does he have women around ? " Dolly nodded . It was not as simple as he thought , she said to herself anxiously as she took the stand . If she were to answer those questions truthfully , she could not give a Yes or a No . He was neat , for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the painters she had studied with . The house was fairly clean . He could cook : yes . But most of the time she had been cooking for him . He washed dishes , she supposed , when he was alone . And he was methodical , in his way . He drank , but not as much as many people . In the course of an evening , starting before dinner , he would drink about half a bottle , she had noticed . But lots of the men up here started drinkingat ten in the morning . And she had never seen him as tight , for instance , as Martha and Miles Murphy had been , the night of the play-reading . As for women , he had her around . Everything was relative , she reminded herself , as the questioning began . It was like what the anthropologists told you : Sandy had to be measured by the mores of the culture he was in . She cleared her throat . She had known the plaintiff , Mr. Gray , about one month ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him frequently , in a neighborly way . " Would you say that you knew his habits ? " As far as one could , in a month . " Speak louder , please , " said the judge . Did he have women around ? Not so far as she knew . " How do you know , Miss Lamb ? " the judge interrupted . " Because I was with him , " Dolly replied . The courtroom laughed . The judge rapped with his gavel . " At night , Miss Lamb ? " said Barney . " Yes , at night , " said Dolly . " Explain the circumstances . " " We both were livingalone ; we have a good deal in common . " " You are ap237painter , Miss Lamb ? And Mr. Gray is an art critic ? " " He used to be , " said Dolly . " He knows a great deal about painting . " " And he was interested in your work ? " " He does n't like my work , " admitted Dolly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you saw him just the same ? " the lawyer proceeded , with a smile . Dolly nodded . " Speak up , " said the judge . " Yes . We often had dinner together . " " And who did the cooking ? " " SometimesI did . Sometimes he did . " " Would you say he was a good cook ? " " Oh yes . " " What did he give you to eat ? " Dolly searched her memory . " Spaghetti with clams . Rice and Portuguese sausage . Oysters . And salad , " she added quickly , though in fact it was she who had brought the salad , the two times she had let him cook for her . " Sounds good , " said Barney . " Did he open a can or did he cook these dishes himself ? " " Oh , himself , " said Dolly . " Does he drink ? " Dolly hesitated . " He drinks socially , " she said at length . " What is socially , ' Miss Lamb ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on him . " When he 's with other people . " " He does n't drink alone , you mean , " said the judge crisply , provoking a laugh . Dolly said nothing . " And when he 's with you , Miss Lamb ? " encouraged Barney . " He drinks a little , " said Dolly . " What is a little ' ? " exclaimed the judge . " Be specific . One drink , two drinks , five drinks ? " " One or two , " quavered Dolly . She was not really lying , she thought ; she was only interpreting Sandy 's daily consumptionin the judge 's terms ; what would be five drinks to the judge would be one or two to Sandy . And wine did not count . " Sometimes a nightcap , " she added . " And that 's all ? " said Barney . Dolly nodded . " Speak up , " said the judge . " Yes . " She looked up and saw Clover 's little blue eyes staring harshly at her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she swayed and steadied herself on the stand . " Go on about his habits , Missp238Lamb , " she heard Barney say . All she could think of was that she had just perjured herself and that Clover and her lawyer knew it . The judge was looking at her curiously , waiting for her to say something , but she had forgottenwhere she was in her testimony : had they asked her yet about his housekeeping ? " Is Mr. Gray 's house clean ? " prompted Barney . " Oh yes , " she said , swallowing . " Very . " " Dishes washed ? All that ? " " Oh yes , " said Dolly . He seemed to be expecting her to say something more . " He does his laundry , " she volunteered . " You 've seen him ? " " Yes , " she said . " In the pond . " Again there was laughter , and she could tell from the lawyer 's expression that she had said the wrong thing . " In the pond ? What pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on , " said Dolly . " The water is very soft , which makes it good , Mr. Gray says , for washing . " In the courtroom , the philistines roared . She could feel their hatred of Sandy , of anything simple and different from themselves , spill out of their braying throats . And she could feel him crouched in his seat behind her , powerless to defend himself , with his white shaven face , a shorn , piteous Samson . The blood rushed to her cheeks ; she flamed with temper . " Make them stop laughing , " she said , obdurately , to the judge . " I wo n't testify any more unless you give Mr. Gray a fair hearing . " She set her chin . " Order ! " cried the sheriff , standing up . " Go on , Miss Lamb , " the judge said gravely . The courtroom was absolutely still . " Mr. Gray , " said Dolly , " is not an ordinaryperson . You all think he 's strange because he tries to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . But he does n't go out bird-watching , with a book , like me . He just does it naturally , the way he sleeps and eats . He hates any kind of dishonesty or compromise ; that 's why he does n't like my painting . He knows the woods the way Thoreau did or the scouts inp239Fenimore Cooper . He can set traps and shoot and whittle and make bows and arrows . That 's why he 'd be a good father ; he could teach the children a lot of things that children do n't learn any more . Fishing and hunting and making things . He taught me how to open oysters , with just an ordinary knife . And how to scale fish and clean them . But he 's not a crank , either . He does n't want to turn the clock back , artificially . He reads comic books and listens to radio serials ; he thinks they 're much more real than modern novels and poems . He 's not afraid of violence , though he 's very gentle himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . That 's what he 's taught me , and I 'm grateful for it . " " Can he sew ? " said the judge , drawing another laugh , deliberately , from the courtroom . " Yes , he can , " said Dolly , defiantly . " Why should n't a man be able to sew ? He can knit too ; he learned in the Merchant Marine , when he was a boy . Is that something to be ashamed of ? Do n't you want a man to be self-sufficient ? Is n't that the American ideal ? " " That was great , great , " said Sandy , when she came back to her place . The other witnesses nodded . Clover 's lawyer had not even tried to cross-examine her seriously . He had only one question : " Are you in love with Mr. Gray ? " The judge said she did not have to answer that , but she had said no , in all honesty , and left the stand in a blaze of glory . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barney made a little pantomime of clapping , when the judge was looking the other way . Dolly was so flushed with these tributes and with her own extraordinary temerity that she could hardly listen to Sandy , who followed her on the stand . She sat with her own voice echoing in her ears , in a trance of wonder and pride . Vaguely , she heard Sandy testifying to his concern for the children , and how he was fixing up the house for them . He hoped , he said , to marry again , top240give the children a mother , but in the meantime he was going to employ a woman to take care of them , after school , in the afternoons , while he was working . He made a good impression  --  Dolly felt , on the whole  --  simple and straightforward . But her mind kept drifting off , back to her own testimony , and contrasting it with his . Hers was better , she felt certain . He was a little too apologetic , and his voice was monotonous . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stand , you could have heard a pin drop . She was the best ; she almost wished Martha could have heard her and seen the lawyer applaud . Even if John and Martha disapproved , they would have to admire her performance . She almost wished that she could be called back on the stand ; a second time she would be more sure of herself , from the outset  --  she had stumbled badly at first , until she found the right note . " How was I ? " said Sandy , coming down from the stand and interrupting her reverie . " Marvelous , " said Dolly , mechanically , her conscience smiting her for the vanity and self-absorption that had kept her from paying attention to him . " Marvelous , " she repeated , more enthusiastically . But her mind was still on herself , and all she could hear was the iambs of Sandy 's voice pounding in her inner ear : " You 've won the case , " " You 've won the case . " Compunction pricked her when Clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly said to herself , appalled by the life-history that unfolded . Poor Clover had been a baby-sitter since she was eleven years old , and she had worked with retarded children before she married Sandy , at the age of nineteen . She was wonderful with children , all her witnesses had averred , and her lawyer had affidavitsfrom the summer people who had sent their children to a little play group she had run for the pastp241three summers . She was a poor housekeeper and manager , she conceded , under questioning , but she could not keep the house tidy when it was full of dogs and cats and youngsters . Nearly every night , her children had one of their friends staying with them . They were doing well in school , and last year they had got more Valentinesthan any other children in the middle grades . She went to the P.T.A . and made costumes for the school plays and played the guitar at school entertainments . Her lawyer presented affidavits from the children 's teachers . And she had a big heart , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan , a spastic child , whose mother had died of tuberculosis . The child was now in an institution , but Clover went to see him almost every week . She went to see her father , too , who was in the state hospital , and brought him magazines and candies , though he used to beat her horribly , according to her ex-stepmother . " She always slips him a bottle , " the man in the white suit contributed in an undertone . Barney was brutal in cross-examination . Was it true , he wanted to know , that there had been complaints and some parents had removed their children from her play group because she let the boys and girls go naked ? It was true , Clover admitted , but the children were small , under school age . " That 's a lie , " whispered Sandy . " Some of them were sprouting breasts . " Then Barney began to ask her about what he called " a little episode " at a beach picnic two summers ago . Had n't she tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Clover , in a low voice ; she had just wanted to be alone and swum out to sea . The others had got frightened and gone after her . When he got to the truckdriver , finally , Clover insistedthat he was paying board , but she burst into tears when Barney wondered whether she had ever listed his rent as income on her tax return . Naturally , she had n't ,  |p242and  she lost her head altogether during the next questions , when Barney was pressing her about where the truckdriver slept and whether the little room she claimed he slept in had a clothes closet . She whirled around and called Sandy a moocher and announced that the real trouble between them was that he had fallen behind on the maintenance payments and would not settle with her when she needed the money . That , she cried , was when he had decided to get righteous about the truckdriver . He was all paid up now because his lawyer had made him do it , before coming into court . " Ask him , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged the judge , pointing her stubby finger at Barney . But the judge told her that a lawyer could not be a witness to what passed between him and his client . To satisfy her , however , he called Sandy back on the stand . " Is it true that you ceased to make payments until the time this action was begun ? " " No , it is not true , " said Sandy , wearily . " Mrs. Gray is a pathological liar . I was short of money during the summer , when Mrs. Gray was getting paid by her play group . By mutual agreement , we decided that I could wait until fall to catch up with the maintenance . " Clover was put back on the stand . " Is this true ? " said the judge . " If you mean he told me he could n't pay and I said yes , let it go for the time being  --  yes , " said Clover . " You should n't have done that , " said the judge sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him pay it ; that was your duty under the law . " " But if he did n't have the money .. . ? " " It makes no difference , " said the judge . " It is not for you and your former husband to decide whether he shall support his children . That is the court 's privilege . When you divorced your husband here , you put those children under the court 's protection . They 're wards in chancery , actually . " The two lawyers wagged their heads respectfully , in acknowledgment ofp243this legal point . The judge turned back to Clover . " You should have brought him down here , into court , " he said severely , " the first payment he missed . When was that ? " " In June , I guess . " " And how long did this hiatus continue ? " " Till the end of October . " " And when did this boarder come to live with you ? " " Last spring . Around Decoration Day . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , his voice rising . " No , " said Clover . " By letting the maintenancelapse , you 've practically entered a confession of guilt with this court . You suggest to my mind and to the mind of any reasonable person that you let your ex-husbandoff paying for your support because you got a new fellow . " " That was n't the reason . Honestly , " said Clover . " Look , Your Honor , he had no money . I was making some . I have feelings . I was sorry for him . " She had been wiping her tears with a Kleenex ; her makeup had come off , and as a result she looked much prettier . " Then , " she said , " when I needed the money , for some winter clothes for the kids , he told me that he would n't pay me and that furthermore he was going to sue to get them back if I kept pestering him . " " There were no witnesses to this discussion ? " " No . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , you 've brought this action on yourself . You gave your ex-husband a right to think that he was no longer bound to support you . Regardless of your motive . You did n't use good judgment . Let me give you a little maxim for general use , quite apart from this case . Never let a fellow drop behind in his payments . Keep after him . Ask the stores . Ask the financing companies . Chances are , Mrs. Gray , if you let him get behind , he 'll work up a grievance against you , because the longer you do n't make him pay , the more he owes you . Pretty soon , it 's got so darn big he ca n't pay it . " He slapped his hand on the long table . " Keep after ' em , " he repeated , addressing thep244courtroom at large . " That 's right , your honor , " agreed the two lawyers , grinning . " Where are those children ? " he demanded . " Waiting for you , in chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge got up and went out . Waiting for him to come back , the courtroom grew very restless . Some of the witnesses wandered out to smoke and fraternized with the enemy on the courthouse steps . The consensus , as reported by the man in the white suit , was that Sandy was going to win . Dolly 's testimony , it was agreed , had done him a lot of good , and Clover had queered her own pitch : her tears and accusations gave the truth away . And yet no one seemed satisfied . The thought of the children , closeted in there with the judge , who was going to decide their fate , seemed to weigh on the witnesses ' spirits . Faces darkened , moodily ; conversation flagged ; watches were consulted , repeatedly . A sense that this was a serious matter had somehow permeatedthe atmosphere . The man in the white suit kept grimacing , as if he had eaten something indigestible . Dolly was sick at heart . If Clover lost the children , it would be her fault : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . But now that she had heard Clover , she began to pray that Sandy would lose . She did not want to be answerable for all the little lies she had told on the stand . She gritted her small teeth and tried to send thoughtmessagesto the judge , begging him to ignore her testimony . Clover was not an ideal mother  --  anyone could see that  --  but Sandy was not an ideal father , either , despite the picture Dolly had sketched of him . Uncomfortable memories stirred in her : she remembered how cross he had been when she woke him up , one day , at ten o'clock in the morning . He liked to sleep late and he was often brusque and short-tempered . And he was hardly ever onp245time . It was a little unfair of him , moreover , not to have told her that Clover had " a hand " with children . But she herself was at fault in this : she should never have agreed to testify without hearing Clover 's side . At the very least , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wondered whether she could retract her testimony . But what would they do to her if she got up and confessed that she had lied a little under oath ? And what would Sandy say if she betrayed him after he had been lauding her for her " courage " ? " The court favors the mother , " she repeated to herself , under her breath . The way the judge had scolded Clover , about the money  --  was n't that a sign that he really favored her and blamed her for endangering her case ? The judge mounted the bench . His face was very stern , and he summoned the social worker , who talked to him in whispers , glancing back at Sandy and Clover . Dolly 's stomach turned over ; she did not dare look at Sandy . Then the judge announced his decision . Clover was to keep the children ! Jubilate ! Saved ! She could feel the man next to her exhale , as though in relief . He winked . On her other side , Sandy stiffened ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dolly stole a look into his shaved face . He was crying . Guilt smote her . She could not bear the thought that she was selfishly glad while he was suffering . He pulled off his white evening scarf and buried his face in it . The judge was giving Clover a very stiff lecture . He was going to put her on probation , he said , and have the social worker make reports on her . He was not at all satisfied with the conditions in her home as described by Mrs. Viera and the milkman . But no actual evidence of immorality had been presented in court . In his view , shep246would do well to get rid of her boarder ; the maintenance allowance should be sufficient for the household if she planned her budget carefully and did not waste money on drink . Under normal circumstances , he declared , he would have taken the children away from her , but the record of the father moved him to leniency . He believed , despite much of the evidence , that she genuinely loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with her . If there had been a respectable person represented in the proceedings , a grandmother or an aunt , he would not have hesitated to remove the children from both parents . But he had found , on inquiry , that there was no such person in the offing . The father would have the right of visitation . He had come into court as the plaintiff , asserting that he had changed his ways , and brought a witness to attest this . But the brevity of her acquaintance with him made it impossible to give any legal weight to her impressions . The courts in this district had known the plaintiff over a period of years . The bench ventured to suggest that the plaintiff might have a motive for pulling the wool ( laughter ) over Miss Lamb 's eyes . In any case  --  the judge 's voice sharpened  --  here was a man who had been four times married , deserted by one wife and divorced by two on charges of extreme cruelty . One of these wives now appeared before the court to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictory course of conduct , to put it mildly . The practice of **27;8525;TOOLONG was being abused by counsel . The court was capable of forming its own impression of the character of the litigants . It had its own records and the records of the S.P.C.C. to assist it . To bring in a witness who had known one of the parties " about one month " was an insult to the court 's intelligence and would notp247be condoned if it were ever repeated . The judge glared at Barney . " Yes , Your Honor , " said Barney , but he seemed quite unperturbed . He even grinned at Dolly , as the judge continued , in a more and more sarcastic vein . At the same time , observed the judge , disagreeably , he understoodcounsel 's desire to introduce as a witness a young woman of irreproachable character and fine antecedents , who did not , so far as the court knew , possess a police record . To Dolly 's astonishment , both sets of witnesses began to chuckle appreciatively . Yes , the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothea Lamb had never had her license suspended  --  his gray eye raked the witness  --  or been arrested for brawling or check-kiting or draftevasionor assault and battery or drunk and disorderly or vagrancy . " He 's kidding , " the man in the white suit reassuredDolly . " He 's a great bottle- and trencherman himself . Makes allowances for artists and writers . Used to sit in superior court , where these cases come up . Great sense of humor . " Since all the New Leedsians were giggling delightedly , Dolly forced a wan smile , which she slowly let die when she saw that Sandy was unmoved by the judge 's sallies . He had stopped crying , but his deep-set eyes were fixed in a cold stare and his long thin body was rigid . Dolly touched his arm , and he began to tremble , all over , like a person in a high fever . As soon as the judge stopped talking , Sandy got up and raced out of the courtroom , without a word to anyone . Dolly followed , alarmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody seemed to care what had happened to him ; opinion , even among his own witnesses , had turned against him . He ought to have thought twice , she heard them agree , before washing all that dirty linen in public . That was what had turned the judge against him : a case like that got in the papers andp248gave the community a bad name with outsiders , which in turn affected rentals and real-estate values . All the judges up here liked to see the lawyers make a stipulation and hear abbreviated testimony . Moral indignation echoed through the corridors . " He 's fouled his own nest , " cried the old woman in slacks , as she limped up to congratulateClover . They were so changeable , Dolly thought distractedly . The courthouse emptied , and nobody would help her look for Sandy . They were closing the building before Barney came to her assistance and found him for her , finally , in the men 's toilet , where he had been throwing up . He was in a dreadful state . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping , for him to vomit by the roadside . In Digby , he had her get out and buy him a pint in the liquor store , which he drank from in silence as they jogged along . This grief terrified Dolly . She was afraid to speak to him , because any word from her would seem false under the circumstances , for she was not really sorry that he had lost the children , but only sorry for him  --  more awed than sorry , if the truth were told . She felt very remote from him and small , like a fly speck , because she could not share whatever it was he was feeling . This sense of distance was increased when he came into her cottage and set the pint down on the table , two-thirds empty . He took her face between his hands and began to kiss her , wearily , as if he did not want to . An awful smell came from him , of vomit and raw whiskey ; his tongue was sour in her mouth . Slowly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the studio couch . But then , when he was naked , nothing happened ; he could not get up an interest , though she did as he directed . All night , he kept retching in her bathroom and coming back to lie with his damp head in her bosom . She was terribly hungry ,  |p249but  he would not let her make tea and toast , to settle his stomach . " Stay here , " he said , whenever she endeavored to move . " We 'll try again in a minute . " " It does n't matter , " Dolly would answer , gently , stroking his sweating head . But he could not get the idea of an obligation to her out of his mind . He fell asleep , still fitfully nut t teringof " having another try . " Just before dawn , Dolly faced the facts , covered him with a blanket and a comforter , and crept into her own bed.  |p250ARTHA  's first response , when she woke up one morning in November to find that her breasts i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , she said to herself , with a great leap of her soul . John , next to her , was still asleep ; she muted her exultant thoughts for fear they would wake him . It was far too soon to tell him since of course she could not be sure . Yet there could hardly be any doubt . This swelling was one of the recognized signs . She well remembered the terror of wakingup in her college bed on bright May mornings to find that her nipples hurt when her nightgown rubbed against them . At that time ( she still frowned a little to think of it ) , she had fought with might and main not to know what was the matter with her . She must have bruised herself , she had kept insisting , during senior play rehearsals , in the fencing scene : she was Hamlet , naturally , and the girl who played Laertes had been clumsy with the foil . You were not pregnant , she had tried to believe , unless you threw up in the mornings . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated , without anyone 's knowing . But she had had to have a dangerous abortion , right after Commencement ; the abortionist told her she had waited too long . One 's physiology , she now assured herself , did not change ; the soreness could only mean that . She began to count back , trying to remember whenp251her last period had been . She was tempted to wake John and ask him if he knew . But she did not want to trouble him yet . He would be of two minds , she recognized , about the baby . The money part would worry him , and the responsibility ; men thought of those things first . And he would fret because the baby would be encroaching on her time . On the other hand , he knew how much she wanted a child and wanted to see him as a father ; he underestimated , she was certain , his own capacity for this role . He was a sort of sport in his family , and he was afraid that a baby of his would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got along with . Indeed , he told her gravely , the chances were that he would dislike it , since he disliked most people . To Martha , as a woman , all this was nonsense . She was confident that their child would be exceptional . Moreover , what John would see was that the baby would be an incentive . For its sake , they would work harder , earn more money , improve their characters . She smiled at herself for these thoughts but her convictionremained unaltered . They were foolish , romantic notions , but she and John were romantics , both of them ; they had to have goals and visions . A baby would take up her time ; there was no denying that . But Martha had found that the less time you had the more you were able to do . When she had been doing graduate work and actingat the same time , she had accomplished more  --  John admitted this  --  than she ever had before or since . It was like the miracle of the loaves and fishes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical reviews and to cook too , on the days when the maid did not come . She had been happy and newly married ; that was perhaps the reason . But she would be happy with a new baby ; so would John , if only because happiness was catching . They both , moreover , responded well to pressure from the outside , which was why , doubtless , it had been ap252mistake to come to the country . But the baby would make up for that . To bring in extra money , for her confinement ( Marthalaughed delightedly at the word ) , she could do anotheradaptation . Her Wild Duck was still earning royalties ; only last week , they had got a check from a stock company that was going to do it in Cambridge . A producerhad been after her to do a Strindberg ; John had made her say no , because oi what he called her own work . But the beauty of adaptations was that you could do them at odd moments . She could translate , between feedings , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they had a real motive . They could give up those two drinks at six o'clock , which were becoming almost regular . And wine , which they always had for company and even , sometimes , when they were alone . She would not be allowed to drink when she was pregnant anyway . And it was bad for the child when you were nursing . They could save on food too . They could live on milk and apples and salt codfish and the various kinds of dried beans and clams and salt pork and cornmeal ; there were dozens of ways of doing them , cassoulets and brandades and bacalhaes and polentasand gnocchi , besides Indian pudding and chowders and baked beans . She might even make bread , which she had always wanted to do . She was naturally extravagant , but she was sure she had a capacity for sacrifice . During the last two years of the war , when she was married to Miles , she had managed wonderfully with ration coupons . She could do all the laundry herself , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundress . She would make more soups , and they could collect oysters regularly , the way the Goes did . She would sew all the baby 's clothes herself . And perhaps she could hemstitch some handkerchiefs for John , as part of his Christmasp253present . She could even , she supposed , take up knitting , though she hated women who knitted . Could she learn to make chic sweaters and sell them to a luxury market ? Martha shook her head ruefully . She was too enthusiastic : all her ideas tended to become " follies . " She would have to curb this tendency or John would think her irresponsible . She remembered one Christmas , when she was married to Miles : she had got the pomander ball craze and had made four dozen pomanders out of oranges and cloves and sweet spices . They were supposed to be an economy ; she was going to give them as presents . But Miles thought they were silly and they had all stayed in a drawer , tied up in silk ribbons , till they finally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . Given the slightest prompting , her mind began to indulge itself in woman 's page fancies . She loved domestic chores : the smell of furniture polish , the damp , hot scorch of fresh ironing . And she hated having her time hoarded and rationalized for her , because of her little bit of talent . She did not want to become what she called a machine a ecrire . Drowsily , defiant , she laid down her terms . She did not propose to feed the child out of horrid jars of baby food ; she would make beef teas and custards and puree vegetables herself , no matter how long it took . She had done these things for Barrett , when she was his stepmother . That was the only virtue of being married to Miles : the servants were always leaving , so that she had been able to housekeep without his interference . Now she could do it again . As these words passed through her mind , John stirred . His slender arm disentangleditself from the bedclothes ; he peered sleepily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish she was ! What she had really been thinking was that now she would not have to finish her play . The baby was a reprieve . A gloomy look darkened her eyes . **28;8554;TOOLONG felt a slight twinge of embarrassment when he remembered the indifference of Steve Decker . " Why , I never thought you were terrible , " he said . " I do n't suppose you did , " she answered , " because you never really thought of me at all . Would you like another cup of tea ? " " Thanks , " Willis said , " I would enjoy another cup , " and his mind moved awkwardly as he tried to think of something else to say . " It 's a good thing , getting over being in love with someone . It clears the decks , does n't it ? " " Yes , " Sylvia Hodges said , " it sort of clears the decks . Let 's talk about something else . " " All right , " Willis answered , " anything at all . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Willis had not been aware of the music until then . It was true he had never thought of Sylvia Hodges . This was the first time he had thought of her seriously as a person separate from her environment . " Suppose you tell me what you really want , I mean out of life and everything , " she said . " Out of life ? " Willis repeated after her . " I know it 's a silly question , " Sylvia said , " and probably it shows why I 'm not good at talking to men . " " How do you mean , " he asked her , " that you ca n't talk to men ? " " Oh , " she said , " I always say something like that and it drives them off . " " Well , " Willis said , " personally I always like a good serious talk . I guess everybody tries to figure what he wants out of life . I know I 've given it serious thought personally , but I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sylvia said . " I know it 's fresh of me but just looking at you makes me curious , because you look so happy and so sure of everything . " " I 'm glad you think I look happy , " Willis said , " but I would n't say I am , entirely . Actually  --  to draw an inventory  --  I want to be successful , to get ahead , and eventually to be my own boss , with a business of my own some day and a home of my own of course ,  |p201and  a family . But my main problem just at present is to get ahead , and that 's quite a game in this town . " He had forgotten about Sylvia , being lost for a second in his own imagination , but he was acutely aware of her when he paused . She was leaning toward him listening , and it was the first time he had ever thought of her as good-looking . " Well , that 's my picture and now it 's your turn . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He saw her hesitate but the light had not left her face . " I 'd like about what you want , " she said , " but a girl ca n't get any of those things by herself , you know . I 'm awfully tired of being poor and bright . " She gave her head a quick shake . " I 'm tired of being just me . If I were to tell you what I want just now , you 'd think I was an awful fool . " " Oh , no , " Willis said . " Go ahead and tell me . " " All right , " she told him , " I want that green dress in Bergdorf Goodman 's . I always want something I ca n't get . " The Plaza was not a bad place for wishes , he often thought afterward . The voices and the music made Willis gay and reckless . " Personally , " he said , " I 've been wanting to buy an automobile all day , and drive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked him . " Really ? " Nothing that he was thinking made much sense . He could never analyze the reason behind the decision that he made , and he never cared to try to explain it . " Listen , " he said , " if you want that dress we 'll go over and buy it . " " Do n't be silly . Of course I ca n't do that , " she said . " You can if you want to , " he told her . " We 'll buy the dress and then we 'll buy a car . It might be a very good idea if you and I did what we wanted for once . " " Willis , " she said , " do n't be ridiculous . Of course I could n't do anything like that . " He smiled at her . He had often considered large sums of money in the abstract , but he had never realized so definitely and concretelyexactly what money meant . " Sylvia , " he asked her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " No , " she said , " of course I 'm not afraid , only  --  what would people say ? " " No one needs to know , " he said , and he nodded to the waiter and asked him for the check . He was Willis Wayde again as soon as they were out of the Plaza , and Sylvia Hodges , though she did have a good figure , looked plain and rather pale . She would have looked much better if she had worn more lipstick . She was Sylvia Hodges again , the girl whom he used to know in Cambridge . " You know I ca n't let you buy me a dress , " Sylvia said , and it no longer seemed possible now they were out of the Plaza . " I do n't suppose you can , " Willis said , " but just the same I 'm glad I asked you . " " I never thought that you and I could be so much alike , " she said . " I guess we 're both tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " he said , " I guess so . " " Well , " she said , " it 's been awfully nice seeing you , and thanks for the tea . I really ought to be going now . " " " But you have n't told me where you live , " Willis said . " Ca n't I come up and call on you sometime ? " " Oh , I live in an apartment with another girl , " she said . " You do n't want to see me again , do you ? " " Yes , " he said , " seriously , I want to , " and he got out his notebookand pencil , and she gave him her address and telephone number . " But I am going to buy an automobile today , even if it 's a Ford . " " Then I 'll go with you , " she said . " I 'd like to see what it 's like to buy one . " Willis 's five years in New York with Beakney-Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had risen by gradual steps from an ordinary employee in the office to a first-rate junior executive , and he had started from the bottom in the worst years of the depression . It was confusing to him that Sylvia Hodges should have disturbed his assurance that afternoon . There was always a reaction to everything , and reaction sweptp203over him when he went to his apartment on West Tenth Street in order to bathe and change before meeting those clients at the Waldorf . Willis lived at that time on the third floor of one of those old brick dwellings that he liked to call " mansions " which still existedon Tenth Street . His room might have been the owner 's bedroom before the house was remodeled into apartments . Its proportionsreminded him occasionally of the Harcourt house , and the Harcourt house was always the standard of his tastes . This must have been in his mind when he had shopped around for secondhandfurniture and rugs , at a time when it was still possible to pick up Victorian chairs and tables at a reasonable price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room a modern touch . His clothes were in a black walnut wardrobe which he had purchasedfor fifteen dollars . The rugs , though worn , were good Persian carpets . He had bought a mirror and two steel engravings for the wall , and a Morris chair and a General Grant desk and a revolving bookcase . If acquaintances from the office asked why he did n't buy some new stuff now that he could afford it , Willis always answered that he liked it as it was . He always felt at home whenever he reached his apartment , but its quiet was like a rebukeon that May evening . He felt foolish and uncertain of himself , once he was inside the room and the door was closed . He had bought a runabout and he had written his personal check for it in the showroom and had agreed to take delivery late Monday afternoon . He did not mind the expense as much as not knowing exactly why he had made the purchase , but he did know that he would never have taken such a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done it on account of her , but now that she was gone the episode was like a daydream . At the same time a trace of his elation still was in him . Without his being in love with Sylvia Hodges , for a while their minds and desires had blended together , and they had defied together things that held them . They had both wanted the power of money , and they had felt its power . It had expressed itself in the glittering showroom with its friendly salesmen and in the red paint andp204leather of the car . They had also shared an identical sense of guilt . He remembered she had told him in a frightened whisper that he really ought not to do it . " It 's just as though I had done it myself , " she said . " I never thought you 'd be so crazy , " but she was really saying he was not crazy , that she admired him for the act and that she understood his motives . When he selected a new tie and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light hair were the same as they had been that morning . It might be just as well not to see Sylvia Hodges again . She was plain and awkward and yet she would have looked well in that green dress . When his telephone rang , Willis was so deep in his imaginationthat the sound made him start guiltily . " Hello , Willis , " a girl 's voice said . " Oh , " he answered , " hello , darling . " It was Lydia Hembird calling , who had an apartment in the Village in order to get away from her parents ' home in Montclair , New Jersey , and who was studying at the Art Students League . " Darling , " Lydia said , " have you got a girl up there looking at etchings , or have you got a cold or something ? " " Oh , no , " Willis said . " Why ?

" " Of course I have n't , darling , " Willis said . He had to leave to keep his appointment at the Waldorf , but at the same time he had an alluring mental picture of Lydia . " Look , Lydia , " he said , " you do n't know how much I wish I could , but I 've got to go right out . Business entertainment . It 's a crowd from Cleveland and I 've got to see Red , Hot and Blue again . " " You poor darling , " Lydia said . " You promised you were going to call me up this afternoon , you know .

" Of course he should have called her and of course he should have remembered . " I never dreamed you 'd be waiting around all this time just to hear from me , " he said . " But I told you I was going to , " she told him . " Have n't you had me on your mind at all ? You said you were always thinking about me . You told me so the other night . " " Of course I 've been thinking about you , darling , " Willis said , " but there are lots of other things .

" Business , " he said , " and it looks as though I 've got to go out to Cleveland next week . " " I 'll bet it was n't all business this afternoon , " she said .

" " Then if you ca n't come over tonight , " she said , " come over for breakfast in the morning . " He was still tied there by the telephone cord to Lydia . " I wish I could , " he said , " but I have to take those people out to Darien in the morning . " He waited for her to answer , but there was nothing but unbelievingsilence . It was a relief at last to be able to feel honestly indignant . " If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow morning and stand by the Park Avenue entrance of the Waldorf . I 'm going out to Darien with Mr. Hawley from Cleveland . "  | " Darling , " Lydia said , " you can come around on Sunday night , ca n't you ? " " Why , yes , I 'd love to , Lydia , " he said , " and good-by until then , darling , and I 'll tell you a secret , but I did n't mean to tell you until Sunday night . " He could not understand what made him say those last placatingwords , except it was unkind to leave her with the feeling that he was not enthusiastic . " I 've bought a Ford runabout with red leather upholstery . I bought it this afternoon . " " Oh , darling , " she said , " was that why you did n't call me ? " " Yes , " he said , " of course it was . " " Darling , " she said , " I ca n't wait . I 'm awfully sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of temporary relief when he hung up the telephone , and it was a greater relief to think about Sylvia Hodges . She was different , he was thinking , from any girl he had ever known , shy and aloof and proud , and even her plainness was appealing . Sylvia Hodges would never seduce him in an off moment . Sylvia would never bother him on the telephone . It was also a relief to meet Mr. Nat Hawley in his suite at the Waldorf , because there Willis was dealing with a familiar personality . Industrial executives , Willis was beginning to learn , were different from Mr. Henry Harcourt , who was an older model , but they were all pounded and battered and then smoothed on a sort of universal production line . Mr. Hawley 's suite was in disorder . There was an array of bottles on the table , and ice and soda and an untouched plate of sandwiches and even two individual bottles of milk . The contents of a briefcase were scattered over another table , and coats were draped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth in his shirt sleeves , holding a highball glass . Pete Judkins , second vice president of Hawley Pneumatic Tool , was pouring himself a drink , and Art Rose , assistant sales manager , in his undershirt , with his face covered with shaving cream , stood in a bedroom doorway . " Damn it , " Mr. Hawley was saying , " after you 've made a salep207take your hat and get the hell out . You can tell all the boys that from me personally , Art . " When he saw Willis , Mr. Hawley gave a loud , happy cry . He was a heavy-jowled man with black eyebrows , and he clasped Willis by the hand and at the same time held him by the elbow . " Well , well , if it is n't our host for the evening , " he said . " We 've just been sort of washing up and having a little skitch and soda before we get on the road . Help yourself to skitch , unless you want some bourbon . " " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Willis answered heartily . It was always best to pretend that you liked liquor , and yet he knew that Mr. Hawley 's hard brown eyes were watching how he handled it . " You call me Chief , " Mr. Hawley said . " You 're working for Pneumatic Tool tonight , is n't he , boys ? " " He sure is , Chief , " Pete Judkins said . " Okay , Chief , " Willis said . " Hello , Pete . Hello , Art . " He had not forgotten that they had reached a first-name basis at the University Club . It paid never to forget . " You go wash your face , Artie , " Mr. Hawley said . " We 've got to get on the road and see Red , Hot and Blue . What 's the plot of it ? Am I right in believing that a girl sits on a waffle iron ? " " That 's right , a waffle iron , " Willis said . " There are really some good bits in the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waffle iron , " Mr. Hawley said . " It was a pretty hot iron for her too , " Willis answered . " Oh , boy , " Mr. Hawley said , " did you get that one , Pete ? I 've got to remember that one at the Orono Club . " He cleared his throat . " That 's in Cleveland . I get in twice a week to grab a bite of lunch at the Orono . " " How about another short snort , Chief ? " Pete Judkins asked . Mr. Hawley frowned and handed the second vice president his glass . " Just a light one , Pete . Say , Willis , do you know what I always , tell my boys ? " Willis laughed . You always had to get into the spirit of the moment.  | " I 'd really like to know , Chief , " he said . " Come here , Pete , " Mr. Hawley said . " Willis , you take a good look at Pete . " Willis laughed again and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something about Pete confidentially , " Mr. Hawley said , and he lowered his voice elaborately . " Pete 's all right except when it comes to women . I practically wet-nursed you , did n't I , Pete , and look where you are today . " " Still with the old chain gang , Chief , " Mr. Judkins said , and he smiled to indicate it was all good clean fun . " You know , " Mr. Hawley said , " I 've got the finest , most loyal crowd around me that there is in any God-damn organization in this whole beautiful country . My boys make me proud , and seriously , just a little humble too . We 're all for one and one for all in Pneumatic Tool , and  --  well , here 's what I tell the boys . Work hard and play hard . " It was amazing how clearly Willis could remember the scene . He already knew that you should never underestimate anyone like Mr. Hawley . If he sounded fatuous and silly , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . They were all lions in the cage . " Personally , " Mr. Hawley said , " I believe in having a lot of fun . " " Say , Chief , " Mr. Judkins said , " do n't you think we ought to be going ? " " Yes , " Mr. Hawley said , " but let me make my point . " Mr. Rose had returned from the bathroom , and they all waited for Mr. Hawley to make his point , and this was somewhat difficult , because Mr. Hawley appeared to have forgotten just what point he was making . " Personally , " Mr. Hawley said , " I used to be quite a playboy , but I have to watch the skitches now . " Everyone laughed sympathetically , and Mr. Hawley cleared his throat . " The greatest playboy I ever knew in business , " he said , " happens to have one of the finest organizational minds I know , and he is a very dear close personal friend of mine . I do n't know howp209he still keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Nagel , and P.L. is a sweetheart . " There was a moment 's respectful silence . The name came out of the past , but Willis was always good at names . " Is that Mr. Nagel of Simcoe Rubber Hose and Belting ? " Willis asked . " It certainly is , " Mr. Hawley said . " Were you ever acquainted with P. L. Nagel ? " It all went to prove that it paid to remember names and faces . " I only just met him , " Willis said . " It was when I was working in a small plant in Massachusetts  --  the Harcourt Mill . Mr. Nagel wanted to buy the mill . " " Son , " Mr. Hawley said , " you can shake hands with me again . Any friend of P.L. 's is always a friend of mine . " " I just happened to meet him , " Willis said . " There is n't any reason why he should remember me . " " Do n't you fool yourself , son , " Mr. Hawley said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine . " " Say , Chief , " Mr. Judkins began . Mr. Hawley waved his hand . " Do n't crowd me , boys , " he said . " Let me make my point . I believe in fun , but life is n't all fun either . There are finer things in life . " Mr. Hawley looked around him sharply , but everyone was listening . " Life is n't all play , " he said , " and it is n't all work . A wellroundedman makes all sorts of contacts . I like queer people . I like preachers except on Sunday . " Everyone laughed heartily , but Mr. Hawley raised his hand . " Just a minute , fellows , " he said . " Just a minute  --  let me make mypoint . I suppose you think I 'm a silly old crock , do n't you ? " Everyone laughed gaily . " Now , for instance , " Mr. Hawley said , " about three years ago we were selling some drills to Rothstein Mining and Development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you , Pete ? "  | " Yes , Chief , I certainly do , " Mr. Judkins said . " It was a real experience , " Mr. Hawley said . " Everything 's a real experience , even down to the socialist sons of bitches in Wash-ington . " Everyone laughed , but Mr. Hawley raised his hand . " There were all sorts of experts around that table  --  mining engineersand geologists and things like that  --  among whom was a college professor . " Mr. Hawley cleared his throat again . " I do n't recall why the Rothstein people had retained that professor , but he was a real contact . He knew about fishes and red sandstone , and he wrote a book which he presented me with , personally inscribed . His name was Hodges . He 's a professor of geology from Harvard University . " " Chief , " Mr. Judkins said , " we really ought to be going " " All right , Pete , " Mr. Hawley said , " but let me make my point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a real experience . Get my coat , will you , Rosey ? " It was strange how the name had come up out of nowhere . For a moment Willis was undecided whether or not to say anything , but finally he spoke . " The fishes were called ganoids , were n't they ? " " Say , " Mr. Hawley asked him , " how the hell did you know that ? " " Why , I happened to know Professor Hodges myself in Cambridgequite a while ago , " Willis answered . It was strange to think that Professor Hodges could be useful to him in a business way . " Say , " Mr. Hawley said , " I forgot you were a Harvard man . " He looked at Willis suspiciously , and Willis felt out of the group for a moment . " Not really a Harvard man , " he said quickly , " only Harvard Business School , " and the tension around him relaxed . " Say , " Mr. Ilawley said , " when did you see the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , " Willis answered , and he still spoke easily , " but I happened to have tea with his daughter just this afternoon at the Plaza . " " Well , son , " Mr. Hawley said , " that 's a fascinating coincidence . Those contacts never do anyone a bit of harm . That 's exactly thep211point I 've been trying to make . Now what was that one about the girl sitting on the waffle iron ? " For a moment Willis could not imagine how he could go through a whole evening with Mr. Hawley and his two employees . He was sure that he was a better man than Mr. Hawley ever had been in his best days . He hoped that he would never be as boring after two drinks as Mr. Nat Hawley . There were , as Mr. Hawley had said , finer things in life , and Willis had a sudden sharp desire for them , and this may have been why his mind went back to Sylvia Hodges . When they were on the street waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm affectionately . " The chief is in quite a mood tonight , " Mr. Judkins said . " You made a real hit with the chief upstairs . " " Thanks , " Willis said . " That makes me very happy . " It made him happy , but not in the way that he implied . It was dangerous to underestimate anyone , but Willis believed that he could handle anyone like Mr. Hawley . All at once he knew as sure as fate that he could strike Mr. Beakney for a raise to ten thousand dollars a year  --  and get it  --  because those unpalatable minutes in that hotel suite had made him harder and shrewder . As a matter of fact he asked Mr. Beakney for exactly that increase in salary on Monday afternoon , after the contract with Hawley Pneumatic Tool was signed . You never knew that you had been changing until after you had changed . He did not know how much five years in New York had influenced him until he found himself facing Mr. Robert Beakney without nervousness or apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . The truth was that he was beginning to know Mr. Beakney rather well , and when you knew someone , your respect might grow , but you were bound to lose your awe . Willis had been told , and he believed it , that he had a future in Beakney-Graham . He had worked his way from the outer office to the row of cubicles in the inner office set aside for junior executives , and recently he had become one of five who worked acrossp212the corridor from the partners . He did not rate a leather-upholsteredcouch as yet , but his name was on his door as large as the names of the other four men who had space beside him . His office came first , and next to him was Hal Towle , graduate of Cal Tech , next Cliff Schirmer , who handled legal problems , and then came Bud Reed , who had been hired from DuPont , and finally Milton Rouse , who had gained his training with International Paper and Power . Beakney-Graham depended on personality , so that all those juniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so keen that you learned not to trust anyone completely , still there was a spirit of companionship in the inner offices . As Mr. Beakney had pointed out to Willis when he had been moved there  --  there were always tempting offers from other firms , and Beakney-Graham must count on loyalty . Ability came first but loyalty was second . There were always young men waiting for your place , but if you stayed , as Mr. Beakney said , there was a real future . Actually Willis had seen two men leave Beakney-Graham in the past year , but he had no desire to follow them , because he was grateful to the firm and devoted to Joe McKitterick , who had placed him where he was . Of course he spoke to Mr. McKitterick first , being careful to explain that he was perfectly happy , with no complaint about anything . " It only seems to me that I 'm worth more than I 'm getting , " he said , " but stop me if you do n't agree . " Mr. McKitterick looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with such requests . " All right , " he said , " go in and see Beakney , but Bob is n't going to like it . I thought you were perfectly happy . " " I am , " Willis said , " perfectly happy , Joe . " " Then who 's been making you unhappy ? " Mr. McKitterick asked . " No one , Joe , " Willis said . " I just feel I 'm worth more than I 'm getting . " Mr. McKitterick drummed his fingers on his desk . " Willis , " he said , " there 's such a thing as pushing too hard . " " If that 's what you really think , " Willis said , " I wo n't push this any more . "  | " No , " Mr. McKitterick said . " Frankly , I told Beakney the other day he ought to do something about you . I do n't want you walking out of here just when I 've got you into shape . Go ahead in and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no wonder that Willis had a warm spot in his heart for Joe McKitterick , because Willis never could forget that Joe McKitterick got him in there at the beginning of the depression , but at the same time it was due to his own ability that he had stayed . " Well , thanks , Joe , " he said , " I guess I will go in and see him , " and was surprised at the matter-of-fact way he said it . " You 've certainly moved on since I saw you there in Massachusetts , " Mr. McKitterick said . " I never thought you 'd get hard to handle . " " Do n't say that , Joe , " Willis told him . " You know I 'd do anything for you . " " I did n't mean it that way , " Mr. McKitterick said . " Actually I 'm rather proud you 're getting hard to handle . " In his own thoughts , the few yards Willis walked to Mr. Beakney'scorner office was a highly symbolic journey . Willis remembered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Beakney 's office with a set of organizational blueprints , but now he was near the end of that long walk . Miss Harrison was typing in the small reception room . The typewriter had the sound of rustling leaves stirred by a gentle wind . " Hello , May , " Willis said , because he could call her May now . " Do you think the boss could see me for a minute ? " She pressed a button on the interoffice telephone . " Mr. Wayde , " she said , " wonders if you might give him a few moments , Mr. Beakney . " Then she smiled at Willis . " Yes , you can go right in . " Mr. Beakney 's corner office afforded a fine view of the Hudson and the Jersey shore . An office , Mr. Beakney often said , should be a place for thought and work , and the man who occupied it ought to be man enough to stand out by himself without the assistance of interior decoration . At any rate , in Willis 's opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known . Mr. Beakney , when you came to think of it , was manipulating a collection ofp214brains he had gathered around him , and also such invisible things as integrity , confidence , and experience . You had to be good to explainthose to a customer , and they all had to be inherent in yourselfas an individual , expressed and subtly emphasized . On enteringhis office you had an impression of the hazy city and then of two or three college diplomas , one of them honorary , which were the only decorations . You always saw Mr. Beakney first , a carefully tailored man , gray at the temples , with aquiline , mobile features , who without the slightest effort could shift himself from mood to mood . Like other young men in the office , Willis must have unconsciouslyimitated parts of Mr. Beakney 's manner until he had become proficient . " Well , well , Willis , " Mr. Beakney said , " the day is nearly over and night is drawing nigh . Sit down and let 's look at the view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Yes , sir , " Willis said , " it looks beautiful from here . " " Stone and steel , " Mr. Beakney said . " That was a phrase I used when I was addressing the chemists ' convention the other night . Have you seen a copy of my speech yet ? " " Yes , sir , " Willis said , " I read it . " He saw that Mr. Beakney was watching him closely . " Yes , " Mr. Beakney said , " but you did n't come here to speak about my oratory , did you ? " His mood was no longer mellow ; he was the quick , incisive Mr. Beakney . " No , sir , " Willis said , and he made his mood change too . " Well , get it off your chest , " Mr. Beakney said . " I have to go to the club and dress for dinner . " " All right , sir , " Willis said . " I want to know if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Beakney gazed at the view for an appreciable length of time without giving any answer , and Willis knew the pause was deliberateand designed to disconcert him . " I do n't like this sort of thing , " he said , " at the end of a hard day . It 's not the custom here for my people to ask for raises . " Instead of being crushed , as he would have been a short time ago , Willis kept his wits about him . Watching Mr. Beakney wasp215enough to tell Willis that he was in danger . Willis had only to say the wrong thing once , and Mr. Beakney 's cool expression told him that it would be very easy to say it . " Mr. McKitterick said you would n't like it , " Willis said . Mr. Beakney looked again at the Hudson River . " Just what in hell "  --  Mr. Beakney 's voice had risen to a cool , hard note  --  " makes you think you 're worth ten thousand a year ? " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I only asked you if you thought so . " " So that 's it , " Mr. Beakney said . " Hawley 's been getting after you , has he ? I rather thought he would . " It was a question of whether to answer or to remain silent , and there was only a second in which to make the choice . " I was n't especially attracted by Mr. Hawley , " Willis said . You could always tell when you had said the right thing , and all at once the tension was broken . " You would n't get on with him at all , " Mr. Beakney said . " Personally , I disliked every moment I spent with him . You 're happy with us here , are n't you ? " " Yes , sir , " Willis said , " very happy . " " I 'm glad to have you say so , " Mr. Beakney said . " You 've been making a real place for yourself here , but I guess we 'd better change your plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped Willis affectionately on the knee . " I guess we 'd better send Hal Towle with Joe to Cleveland . I would n't want to see you in Hawley Pneumatic Tool . " " I would n't want to be there , " Willis said . " Now , Willis , " Mr. Beakney said , " if two thousand dollars more a year makes you happy , why , what 's two thousand dollars ? It wo n't mean anything to you in a while at the rate you 're developing , but after this , you let me make the raises . It 's annoying , being asked . " " I 'm sorry , sir , " Willis said . " Do n't say you 're sorry , " Mr. Beakney said . " I was young myself once . I know what it 's like when someone like Hawley puts on pressure . I wish I knew what he offered you , for purely academic reasons . I 'll bet it was more than ten thousand , but I wo n't ask . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this in a better perspective now , " Mr. Beakney said . " It was loyal of you to come to me first . I wo n't say I would have matched him , but it was loyal . Ability is first here , but loyalty is a close second . " Mr. Beakney slapped his knee again and stood up . " Just the same , " he said , " I guess you 'd better not go to Cleveland . I 've got another problem that came to us yesterday . The Rahway Belt Company wants a survey done . It 's a small outfit  --  not promising  --  but it 's a chance for you to develop , and you worked at Harcourt . Have you forgotten about belting ? " " No , sir , " Willis said . " Well , " Mr. Beakney said , " clear up what you 're doing around here . Next week we 'll send you down to Rahway . I wonder what you want that two thousand for . You 're not thinking of getting married , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Willis said , and he meant every word of it . " It 's the last thing I 've been thinking of . " Until then Willis had been in the ranks of bright nice boys who attempted to achieve success by pleasing . He had spent years like a trained terrier in a vaudeville act , jumping through hoops and turning complicated somersaults in order to earn commendation . He had never snarled or bitten or dreamed of turning on his trainer . It would not be accurate to say that he had finally snarled at Mr. Beakney , but he had , for once , met a superior face to face . He had never realized , until it was over , that he could be capable of meeting successfully anyone of Mr. Beakney 's caliber . What still puzzled him was what had ever made him dare , at that particular time , when he had been doing very well indeed , to face up to Mr. Beakney ? His salary would have taken care of itself automatically if he bad continued jumping through the hoops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After leaving the office he went straight to his apartment on Tenth Street and sat for quite a long while thinking . He had succeeded with Mr. Beakney , he knew now , by giving himself a value which did not exist . Mr. Beakney had thought erroneously that Willis had received a tempting offer from another source , and Willis 's conscience stirred uneasily , because he had allowed Mr.p217Beakney to think it , but then it had all been Mr. Beakney 's own idea . Mr. Beakney was astute enough to look out for himself , and if he had fallen into a trap of his own contriving , there were fine dramatic precedents . If Willis had asked for an even larger raise , he realized that he could have got it . He had missed his opportunity , but he understood that there would be other opportunities . The point was that he was as good as someone in Mr. Beakney 's class . Then he was lonely and he wanted to share his thoughts with someone , which explained why he had pulled out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodges 's number . " Hello , Sylvia , " he said , " this is Willis Wayde . How would you feel about having a bite of supper ? I 'll pick up the car and we might run out to Long Island somewhere . " What would have happened , he often wondered , if Sylvia had not been at home ? As sure as fate he would have called up Lydia Hembird . He was in a mood where he had to call someone.  |p218OCCASIONALLY  it seemed to Willis Wayde that his was only the progress of any successful American who had started as a poor boy and had used the opportunities offered in what was called the American way . It was only when one began to search the mechanismsbehind this pattern that there were complications , negligiblein themselves and even laughable , like the problems in a soap opera , but these were different for every individual . Everyone seemed to deal in a slightly different way with conscience and obligation and everyone had his own concept of happiness and justice as well as his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few fixed points , was somewhat fluid . For this reason , perhaps , there were plenty of people who set themselves up as authorities on instability , like priests and doctors and social anthropologists . These individuals wrote books about chronic dyspepsia , insomnia , posture , introversion , sex in marriage , and occupational therapy , and how to make friends and influence people . You could read these works , you could attend lectures , but in the end it always seemed to Willis that you were still alone . In the watches of the night at least , you were alwaysyou . In an autobiography that he had once written for a subscription volume entitled Industrial Leaders of America , Willis believed that he had adequately covered the high points of his career . " In late May , 1936 , " he had written , " I was sent by the management companyBeakney-Graham to make an industrial study of the Rahway Belting Company . "  |p219On  the morning Willis first visited the Rahway Belting Companyhe drove there in his new car . He was dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consultant in an industrial advertisement . He had read , of course , all the availablematerial on the Rahway Belting Company . He knew it was a small plant that had suffered badly in the depression  --  that its working capital was low , that its preferred stock had passed its dividends for three years , that the control of the company rested in the hands of Mr. Manley Jacoby , and that the other principalowners were Mr. John Hingham , a banker in Orange , and a garage owner by the name of Henry Peters , and a Mr. Jack Meister , a businessman who was also interested in a small machine-tool shop . He also knew that what had saved Rahway Belt in the depression and what was all that kept it running still was its product , the Planeroid high-speed belt made by a patentedprocess . Willis had heard Planeroid spoken of when he was at the Harcourt Mill as a type of belting that offered high durability at low cost . Besides the Planeroid line , he knew that Rahway Belting manufactured rubber hose and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants since he had been with Beakney-Graham to know that exterior conditions were no criteria of efficiency . There were few factories along the tracks between New York and Philadelphia that were objects of aesthetic beauty . Although windows might be broken and paint peeling , a place could still give the impression of order and morale , but his acquired sense of appraisal told him Rahway Belting was a dying duck , with no future and not much of a past . Only a few shabby cars stood in its paper-littered parking lot , and the elderly gatekeepershowed no trace of interest when Willis Wayde approached , but sat slumped in his gatehouse carving a slice of tobacco from a plug . The yard was as dirty as the parking place , and the wooden steps leading to the office were shaky . The waiting space for callers had not been swept , and the girl at an antiquated switchboardbehind the rail knew nothing about his visit . Mr. Jacoby was in , she said , and nodded toward a plain board door . The roomp220where Mr. Jacoby sat reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although it was late in May , a fire was burning in a hot-air stove , and Mr. Jacoby in his shirt sleeves , seated at a golden-oak roll-top desk , looked exactly like a rural stationmaster . He was fussing with a pile of invoices and he pushed his steel-rimmed reading glasses up over his narrow high forehead . " Good morning , " Willis said . " Am I speaking to Mr. Jacoby ? " Mr. Jacoby pulled a soiled handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the corners of his eyes . " Yes , young fellow , that 's my name , " he said , " and it was n't my idea to get you here . " " It was n't his idea , Mr. Jacoby said , but the bank 's idea , and that was the trouble with getting mixed up with banks . Once you started dealing with them you were like a fly on sticky paper . As Willis sat in an uncomfortable chair listening to Mr. Jacoby , he felt like a doctor hearing the complaints of a chronic patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belting with him , had been on flypaper for a long time . Even while Mr. Jacoby 's querulous voice rang in his ears , Willis was beginning to see the picture of Rahway Belt , and he knew right from the beginning that Mr. Jacoby was the key to the puzzle . Willis could see him still , a tired old man in his middle sixties who was constantly trying to fit the past impossibly into the present . He was only a shadow of what he had been once , and he was running down like Rahway Belt , but Willis could see behind the shadow , because it never paid to underestimate anyone , and traces of shrewdness and vestiges of skill enlarged themselves in various ways as Mr. Jacoby talked . " Say , " Mr. Jacoby said , " you know something about belting , do n't you ? " They would n't have sent him down if he did n't , Willis told him , and then he mentioned the Harcourt Mill . " By God , " Mr. Jacoby said , " that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the saying no love is like your first loveapplied to business as well as sentiment . When the Harcourt Millwas mentioned , old loyalties came over him and old habits ofp221thought that unexpectedly fused into creative desire . He had thought in the first minutes of his interview that there was only one honest recommendation he could make  --  to put the factory up for sale and to dispose separately of its Planeroid patents . But now he revised that estimate because an old and inefficient man was talking of the Harcourt Mill . It used to be a great place once , Mr. Jacoby was saying , a finely managed property , and he had made a tour of it some years ago . Before he got arthritis  --  and that was why he had to keep the room dry and hot , on account of his arthritis  --  he had made a practice of traveling around and getting new ideas . That was why he had invested in the Planeroid patents and had bought into the Rahway Belt  --  because he liked new ideas . Planeroid was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if anyone had the guts to build it , but since the depression , everything was different , but if he had twenty years off him he could show them . But to get back to the Harcourt Mill  --  their Oak-Heart line was a fine seller , and Mr. Henry Harcourt was a grand gentleman . Mr. Jacoby wondered , now that Mr. Harcourtwas dead and gone and things were n't going so well up there , what had happened to the Harcourt place . " I guess it 's still right there , " Willis told him , " but I have n't seen it for quite a while . " Willis had deliberately put the Harcourt place out of his mind for a long while , but now he found himself thinking how it would look with the pear and tulip trees about to start their bloom . He could almost smell the New England spring again , and he could almost feel that Mr. Henry Harcourt was beside him as he talked to Mr. Jacoby . He could even think later that the ghost of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss an opportunity . At any rate Willis grasped the vital fact that the Planeroid process was a very good one . Even before he inspected the plant and the books , he had a good picture of the Rahway problem . The whole answer lay in cutting costs and concentrating first on a single line . " I 'd like to have a look at the Planeroid division if I might , " Willis said , and he had been right . It was the only part of the plant that mattered.  |p222It  was an opportunity and Willis had been ready for it . He already had a warm spot in his heart for Mr. Jacoby and a protective feeling that was close to loyalty . It was no wonder when little Al was christened that Willis asked Mr. Jacoby to be a godfather . Mr. Jacoby 's mind was working too , and it was pleasant for Willis to remember that Mr. Jacoby had trusted him right from the very start . " What I need , " Mr. Jacoby had told him late that afternoon , " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Willis said , " we 've got to look around for someone . " " How about you ? " Mr. Jacoby asked . " Oh , " Willis said , " I 'm unfortunately working for Beakney-Graham . I 'm only here to get things started on the right track , you know , but I do think we can put this property on a paying basis . " " You think so ? " Mr. Jacoby asked . It never paid to be too eager . " Yes , " Willis said , " I think so . I may have a few rather radical ideas , but I hope you 'll give us a chance , Mr. Jacoby . " " You show me how we can pay dividends on the preferred , " Mr. Jacoby said , " and you can do anything you want . I can handle my associates . " It had been as simple as that , but then after a certain point most negotiations were simple . If anyone wanted something you had to offer badly enough , you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that it was necessary to move carefully . The Rahway Belting Company was a series of fragments that had to be welded together . The personnel and the stockholders and the sales policy were some of these fragments that he must combine without any serious mistake . He would have to use tact and persuasion and ruthlessness . Luck , of course , enteredinto his handling of Rahway Belt , but his own capacity was always the most important asset . He wanted very much to talk to someone who would listen as he thought out loud . This was why he called up Sylvia Hodges and asked her to dinner when he reached New York that night  --  and not because he wanted her advice or applause . He must have understood from the time he had spoken to Sylvia of that greenp223dress in Bergdorf 's window that Sylvia was as tired as he was of the small contrivings of mediocrity . He knew that she would have been perfectly happy if he had taken her to some small restaurant in the vicinity of Washington Square , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had often entertained for the company . Even in those days Twenty-one was already , according to his rather limited knowledge , one of the most interesting restaurants in New York . You always saw personalities there whoimpressed out-of-town clients  --  people in the Social Register , in- dividuals whose names were in the gossip columns , actors , Hollywood producers , and sometimes authors and playwrights . " I sort of thought you 'd like to see this place , " he told Sylvia . " It 's rather interesting , you know . We 'll have dinner upstairs , but we might order it at the bar and have a cocktail there while we 're waiting . Would you like a Martini , Sylvia ? They make very good Martinis . " " Why , yes , " Sylvia said , " I 'd like one , but you do n't have to do these elaborate things for me , you know . " " I know I do n't , " he said , " but just the same , I like to . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I ought to , I guess . " It pleased him to observe that people were looking at Sylvia curiously . In Twenty-one people always looked curiously at every-one else , since you could never be sure what stranger might be important . Sylvia was never embarrassed by the plainness of her clothes , and Willis was almost sure that they thought she was toowell-known to bother about being elaborately dressed . " Robert Benchley comes here quite often , " Willis said . " You know , Robert Benehley , the humorist . " " Oh , " Sylvia said . " He was on the Lampoon at Harvard , wasn'the ? " " Yes , I think perhaps he was , " Willis said , " but I 'm not sure . " It was pleasant to hear Sylvia mention Harvard , and it waspleasant to see that people were trying to catch a snatch of their conversation . It made him feel that he was almost a personalfriend of Mr. Benchley , the humorist. 1 " Have you read his new book , My Ten Years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " Willis said . " ' In a Quandary , " ' Sylvia said . " Oh , " Willis said , " I get it now . No . I have n't had much time to read lately , except for fifteen minutes with Dr. Eliot 's Five-Foot Shelf before breakfast . " " Do you really do that every morning ? " Sylvia asked . " Of course I do , " Willis said . " I try to finish anything I start . " " But , Willis , " she said , " it will take you years and years . " " All right , " Willis said , " but it 's just as well to read somethingworthwhile , and it 's only fifteen minutes a day . " " I wonder why they picked out fifteen minutes , " Sylvia said , " instead of twenty-five or thirty minutes . " " Because it sounds easier , " Willis said . " It 's like the pricing of merchandise . I 'm reading Montaigne right now . He 's quite a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you can get much out of Montaigne in fifteen minutes , " Sylvia said , and her forehead wrinkled . " Do n't you forget what you 've read the day before ? " " It was tough at first , " Willis said , " but I 'm getting the hang of it now . Would you like another Martini , Sylvia ? " " Are you going to have another ? " Sylvia asked . " I do n't usually , " Willis said , " but I think I will . I 've had quite a day today . " He did not mind if Sylvia laughed at him about the Five-Foot Shelf of Books , because he could see the humor in it too , and he knew that Sylvia was not laughing at him seriously . " Why did you have quite a day ? " she asked . " That 's just what I want to tell you , " he said , " and I do n't know anyone else I want to tell . " Her eyes were bright and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia look so attractive . " I guess everybody 's always waiting for his chance , " he said , " and I have a hunch mine came along today . You see , this morning I was sent out to see a plant in Rahway . " He did not have time to go ahead just then because a waiter interrupted him . " Your dinner is ready , Mr. Wayde , sir , " the waiter said . Theyp225remembered him , of course , because he brought Beakney-Grahamclients there often . Sylvia listened just the way he hoped she would when he told her about Mr. Jacoby and the Rahway Belting Company , and the way her glance met his when he was talking made everything he said sound like a tale of adventure . If there was one thing he knew , he told her , it was the belting business , and here was his chance right in front of him to put a company on its feet . He was not sure of all the details yet , but he had a general plan , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year from now I 'll have the Rahway BeltingCompany making money . " It was not a heroic statement but his enthusiasm gave it a ringingsound , and Sylvia must have felt its contagion . " Oh , Willis , " she said , " do you really think so ? " All words had a different ring when one was young . " They 've got the Planeroid patents , " he said . " Nobody else can make Planeroid . " From the very beginning he was the only one who saw the full potential value of those Planeroid patents . " Sylvia , " he said , and he put his hand over hers without knowing he was doing it , " just wait till you see a sample of Planeroid . " Then Sylvia laughed , but he did not mind , because she did not know what Planeroid was . " We 'll sell the Ford and get a Cadillac before we 're through , " he said . He did not realize until the words were out that he had included Sylvia in his vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until that moment , that he was in love with Sylvia Hodges . It was strange how unexpectedly it had all happened and how naturally they had both accepted it . If it was not all serious , it was partly so , or she would not have said what she said next . " Willis , " she said , " I 'm going to spend my vacation with thefamily . They have a cottage on Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire . I know they 'd love to see you , if you 'd like to go there too . " He had passed through the preliminaries of courtship without his having known it . Without his ever having kissed her or said ap226word of love , he knew he was as good as engaged to Sylvia Hodges . In a busy life it was impossible to recall all dates and sequences , but Willis believed that it was in the summer of 1950 that he had participated in a very worthwhile discussion on the subject of love and marriage . The event had occurred up in Mr. P. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gathered , just by accident , just to get away from the noise downstairs during an especially large machine-tool convention at White Sulphur Springs . It must have been August , 1950 , because there had been several speeches on the Korean War and it had been a big year for conveyor belts . At any rate there were three or four congenial people up in old P.L. 's room  --  not a suite due to an error of the management 's . Consequently they were sitting around on the twin beds with their coats off , relaxing , and old P.L. had a fine display of bottled goods on his bureau . They were just talking about this and that  --  home and kids and golf and gardens  --  in order to get away from business , when P.L. happened to tell how he had first met Mrs. Nagel . Willis loved old P.L. by then , and he realized that P.L. had a lot of mellow wisdom , no matter how much bourbon he consumed . He had a glass of it in his hand right then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Nagel up in the Pinckney office on the seventeenth floor of the Pinckney Building in Chicago , when he had called as a junior executive to carry a message to Jeff Pinckney the year before old Jeff had died of Bright 's disease  --  a tough old rooster and a good old sport , who owned about all the pulpwood in Ontario . Mrs. Nagel had been the receptionist out in the vestibule , and frankly she had looked like a lot of other receptionists P.L. had met . He had said , " Hello , dearie , " to her , not meaning anything at all by it , and she had said he ought to take twenty pounds off before he called anyone " dearie , " and one thing led to another , just horsing around waiting for old Pinckney , until he had asked her out to dinner , and that was all there was to it . Mrs. Nagel had been a lovely wife and now she needed to take some pounds offp227herself . Myrtle 's photograph was right there , on the bureau behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying Myrtle . Somehow in business circles if a marriage did not end in divorce no one ever appeared to regret the step . " And she 's a lovely hostess , " P.L. said . " If you want a lovely hostess , marry a receptionist . Is n't she a lovely hostess , Cal ? " He was speaking to Cal Biggers , president of Biggers Link andForging , with whom Willis had been teamed in a foursome that afternoon . " She is n't any better than Eugenia , " Cal Biggers said , " and Eugenia was n't any receptionist . " " You do n't mean Mrs. Biggers ? " P.L. said , and he winked to Willis . " Who the hell else should I mean ? " Cal Biggers said . " I thought Mrs. Biggers 's name was Ginny , " P.L. said . " I never knew it was Eugenia . " " Ginny 's short for Eugenia , " Cal Biggers said . " Mrs. Biggers does n't like the name Eugenia . " Mr. Nagel threw his arm over Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " nobody can grill steaks like Ginny , but that is n't my point . " " What the hell is your point ? " Mr. Biggers asked . P.L. Nagel got up , crossed over to the bureau , and poured himselfanother bourbon . " Fellas , " he said , " I love everybody in this room like my own brother , not that I ever had a brother . " P.L. was a real wit , and it was really pleasant to be up there informally , because he did n't invite just anybody . " My only point is , " P.L. said , " that marriage is an accident . You do n't know when you 're going to get into it and you really don'tknow why . If I had n't gone up to the seventeenth floor of the Pinckney Building , there would have been a different Mrs. Nagel . You do n't know what you 're getting into until it 's over . In fact I did n't really know Mrs. Nagel well until after we were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was how it was , Willis thought , with him and Sylvia . Hep228had just started going around with her , and finally neither he nor she was going around with anybody else . Perhaps it was impossible to understand character until after you were married , no matter how much two people had seen of each other before  --  and he had certainly seen quite a lot of Sylvia the summer he had been working on the reorganization of Rahway Belt . They had fallen into the habit of having a bite to eat together every evening after Willis returned from Rahway  --  usually at Tony 's Italian Restaurant on Bleecker Street  --  and afterwardsthey had got in the habit of sitting around awhile in Willis 's apartment on Tenth Street , never for very long because Willis had figures to organize and work over every evening . His ideas about the Planeroid process , which did so much to influence his whole career , were already assuming a definite shape . AlthoughPlaneroid was designed as power belting , he already believed that some changes in the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belting which would be cheap enough to enter the competitive field . It was this idea , of course , that finally made Rahway Belt the company that it turned out to be and which helped to make his own industrial reputation . He must have already been thinking of the name that pulled sales promotion together  --  the Planeroid Carry-All line  --  but of course all his creative plans were then only in the thought stage . When you had an idea as big as Planeroid Carry-All , you needed to dream dreams . You had to reach the point where you knew those dreams had essential validity before you cut them down to size and began playing with finance and organization . It was a pleasure to tell Sylvia about what he wanted to do , although for some reason he was reticent regarding his earlier clays on the Harcourt place , and even at the Harcourt Mill . Though Sylvia 's childhood was different from his , Willis could understand intellectually a lot of the things she had faced . Her parents had never cared about money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she admitted herself , had always had an ambition to excel in school and college . She had been obliged to face the hard fact that she was not popular at dancing school or dances . She had developed a contempt for clothes and lipstick ,  |p229and  she had carried those ideas to Radcliffe . She had managed to graduate with a cum laude , as her father had wanted , but what did it amount to now ? It had only taught her that there were a lot of people far brighter than she would ever be , and the last thing that she really wanted was to marry some university instructor and to live the life her mother had . She wanted to have a little fun out of life for once , she said , like having dinner at a place like Twenty-one , and not have to worry about how much it cost . That was one of the wonderful things about Willis , she said  --  that he never appeared to worry . She wanted to go abroad  --  not tourist class  --  and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen enough churches and picture galleries to last her all her life , and pensions where girls learned French , like the one she had spent a winter in once on the rue de l'Universite . The first time Willis had ever kissed her was when she told him one June evening at Tenth Street what she really wanted to do in Paris . She made him feel how wonderful Paris was , and even made him forget the Planeroid process for a while . " Not any stuffy pension in the rue de 1'Universite , " Sylvia was saying , " and not any back seat in the Comedic listening to Racine . I want to go to Foyot 's and then to the Folies Bergere . " " Would you like me to take you there ? " Willis asked . " Yes , " she said , " on the Mauretania . " " All right , " he said , " I 'll take you some day , Sylvia . " " I wish we were going tonight , " she said . " They always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been thinking of the crowds and the farewell messages and orchids and champagneand the voices of the room and deck stewards calling out that it was time to go ashore . " Where 's the best place to buy dresses in Paris ? " he asked . " I 'd rather go to Worth 's than any other , " she said . " Do n't worry . I 'll take you there , " he told her . It had seemed natural to kiss her then , and she had clung to him , and then she hid her face on his shoulder . " This does n't have to mean anything unless you want it to , " she said.  |p230Willis  had never really known Sylvia until they were married , but he did gain a faint impression of that later Sylvia and a previewof future problems when he went to visit the Hodges family that summer at their cottage on Lake Sunapee.  |p231THE  COLUMBIA sociologist for whom Sylvia was working left for a six weeks ' trip on the first of July to study the burial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sylvia went to stay with her parents at Lake Sunapee until he should return . Althoughshe wrote Willis three or four times a week , letters were not the same as Sylvia . It was fortunate for Willis that complicationsat Rahway occupied nearly all his waking hours . There were many later periods of crisis and negotiation in his career which were as arduous and crucial , but he had gained confidence by then so that he never again worked under such strain and pressure as he had in those six weeks . Ile had to show an external confidence and a serene belief in his judgments which he often did not feel . He had to demonstrate that he knew the belting business , and his comparative youth rendered this most difficult . He had to be a salesman and a promoter and a technical expert all in one , and after he had succeeded in selling the Rahway crowd , he had to go to New York and begin all over again with Beakney-Graham . He always admitted that he could never have handled the Rahway situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially Joe McKitterick , and there was no wonder he always had a warm spot in his heart for that fine group . Nevertheless , as he once said facetiously later , he was like someone in the circus all that summer , riding a bicycle on a wire and carrying chairs and tables upon both shoulders . It was all very well to think of Sylvia near a cool lake in New Hampshire , but Willis could not seem to make her understandp232that he could not dash away for a visit with things going as they were . Nevertheless toward the end of July Willis finally did take three days off , making reservations on the night train Thursday , with return reservations on Sunday . Without ever having been to Lake Sunapee , he had a good idea what it would be like , because he had spent a vacation at Lake Placid once and another near the base of Mt . Washington . He took his golf clubs with him , in case there was an opportunity to shoot a little golf , and his black eveningtrousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackets which were popular at the time , in case there should be a dance at the country club . He also packed his tennis clothes , because you never knew what you would run into on a three days ' vacation . It was a pleasure to watch the porter carrying his golf clubs , his tennis racquet and his new pigskin suitcase when he boarded the evening train . He arrived at the junction bright and early the next morning , and Sylvia was there to meet him in the Hodgeses ' four-year-old Ford runabout . When you were away from someone for some time , perhaps you always built pictures , and somehow Willis had thought that Sylvia would be wearing some sort of print dress . Insteadshe had on slacks , a man 's shirt with a frayed soft collar , and sneakers , and he never forgot her expression when she saw the golf clubs . " Oh , Willis , " she said , " there is n't any golf . " " Oh , that 's all right , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there is n't any tennis either , " she said . " I do n't know why I should have thought you 'd know . " " Oh , that 's all right , " he said . " I 'm not any good at tennis any-way . " But she still looked at him doubtfully as he put his suitcase and golf clubs into the rumble seat of the old Ford . " I do n't know why I never described things to you , " she said . " We 're just here camping out , you know , doing our own work , and I 'm afraid you thought there would be a butler . " Of course he had not thought there would be a butler , but Sylvia made him feel out of place , even at the junction.  | " Well , that 's fine , " he said . " I 've always liked camping out . " He did like camping out , although he had never done any of it since he was fifteen , and he was used to housework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willis , " she asked , " did n't you bring any old clothes ? " If she had only told him , he could have bought some khaki trousers and sneakers at Abercrombie &; Fitch . He could have bought a pocket flashlight too , which he found he needed badly after he discovered that the Hodgeses had no plumbing . " Well , I have n't got anything exactly old , " he said , " just some tennis clothes and bathing trunks , but I 'll get along all right . " Sylvia looked relieved when he mentioned bathing trunks . " You can wear those most of the time and a shirt on top , " she said . " Mother always insists on a shirt when we 're on the porch . " " Well , that 's fine , if it is n't cold , " he said . " It wo n't be too cold except at night , " she told him , " but there are gnats sometimes . Maybe you 'd better buy a pair of khaki trousers before we start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her so . " You pick them out , Sylvia , " he told her . " I really do like campingout . " Then in a helpless way she said , " Oh dear , I do n't mean to laugh but you keep wanting to buy me ball gowns , and I 'm going to buy you a pair of khaki trousers  --  a present from me to you . Do n't you see it 's funny ? " It had been a long time since he had seen a small-town men 's toggery , but he was able to get into the spirit of it , and it annoyed him that Sylvia seemed to think he could n't . He was just as good at camping out as she was , he told her , and he liked to fish , he told her . Nothing was more fun than going fishing . The only trouble was that he had never camped out with any people like the Hodgeses , and that place at Lake Sunapee was different from anything he had ever known . The Hodgeses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake in a pine grove a long way from anywhere . " Father bought it for almost nothing during the depression , "  |p234Sylvia  told him , when she tried to explain things while the Ford jolted over a very rough country road . " Oh dear , " Sylvia said , " there 's something else I should have told you . Father 's against drinking at the cottage , but we could have bought a bottle of something . Maybe Tom has some . He does sometimes . " " You know I do n't drink much , Sylvia , " Willis said . " It does n't matter at all . " But frequently that week end he would have been less nervous if he could have had a drink . Once , shortly after Willis had met Lydia Hembird , Lydia had invited him to visit her family in Montclair for a week end , and this had been Willis 's only previous experience as an eligible young man . He had not forgotten the embarrassment caused him by the covert watchfulness and elaborately careless questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Willis until his arrival at Sunapee that his visit to the Hodgeses would offer a similar ordeal . He should have known , of course , from Sylvia 's nervousness , and from the moment he saw the family all waiting for him on the front porch , that his visit had an obvious implication . They were a welcoming delegation there to meet him , and he was sure they had been discussing him ever since Sylvia had driven to the station , and , since there were only board partitions between the rooms , Willis heard his name coupled with Sylvia 's frequently during his stay , although in tactful whispers . " They wo n't be around after supper , " he heard them whisper . " Sylvia will want to take him out in the canoe . " " He 's really very nice , " he heard them whisper . " It is n't his fault that he thought we were living on a golf course . " This last remark had been made by Mr. Hodges , hardly in a whisper . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew his way around , even if he seldom went anywhere . As Willis told Sylvia later , he had been there on approval , like a new vacuum cleaner that could be sent back if it did n't work , not that there were any electric outlets in the cottage . In fact they cooked on a wood stove and went to bed by lamplight , and as Mrs. Hodges said right away , he was a member of the family . Mrs.p235Hodges , who looked more like a frontierswoman than a professor'swife , shook hands with him warmly and understandingly . " Of course I remember Willis , dear , " she said to Sylvia , " and now you 'd better go and peel the potatoes for lunch . You can bring them out on the porch here , dear , and perhaps Willis would like to help you after he puts on some camp clothes , and we can all go on talking about Hitler and the Rhineland and whatever is going to become of it . " " Yes , yes , Sylvia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim that I do n't recall your young gentleman . " Mr. Hodges had not shaved that morning , and he wore khaki shorts and a sleeveless undershirt . " There 's only one rule around here , Wayde . We wear shirts when we 're on the porch . For some reason Mrs. Hodges objects to bare torsos . You 'd better strip down , Wayde , and excuse my legs . I admit I have varicose veins . " " I understand they have something they can inject into them now , sir , " Willis said . " Yes , " Mr. Hodges said , " silicate , I believe , but I 'll leave mine just the way they are . You remember Laura , do n't you ? " Of course Willis remembered Laura . Laura was wearing slacks like Sylvia and she looked frankly and adjustedly ugly . " I choose you for my team if we play games tonight , " she said . It touched Willis that Laura remembered that he had been good at pencil-and-paper games . " Mary , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've ever met Sylvia 's young man , have you ? This is Tom 's wife , Willis . " Mary Hodges was a stocky , red-faced girl in shorts . It seemed to Willis that girls with ugly legs always wanted to show them off . " Hi , " she said , and she shook hands aggressively . " You 're sleeping in the guest coop . " The guest coop , Willis found out later , was a remodeled brooder house that Tom had purchased from a nearby farm . Tom was always working on what he called " improvement projects . " " Hi , Willis , " Tom said . His shirt and bathing trunks and bare arms were caked with clay . " You look as though you 've been battening off the workers down there in New York . " Willis felt his face redden . Sylvia had told him that Tom wasp236interested in the CIO , and he certainly did not want to get into a labor argument off management just at present . At least that 's the way it is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called it his company , but he felt that he had to make some sort of impression . " You come with me , " Tom said , " and you 'll see what labor means . Mary and I are laying a new pipe from the spring to the kitchen . " Willis must have looked startled . Sylvia might have warned him about the absence of plumbing , and Tom burst into a roar of laughter . " There 's no private bath , no telephone  --  and no water if we do n't get busy . Come on , Mary , or we 'll have to haul it in buckets . " Willis did not mind about the plumbing , but he had never dreamed there would not be a telephone , and he had some notes in his pocket for a call he wished to make to Rahway . " Do n't worry , Willis , " Sylvia said , " there 's a telephone half a mile down the road and I can run you there any time . " " No you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Ford . " " Then we can walk , " Sylvia said . " Willis likes to walk . " " The thing for you to remember , Wayde , " Mr. Hodges said , " is that we are only living for a split second geologically . This present interglacial epoch is only fifteen or twenty minutes old geologically . I often find comfort in this fact , and maybe you will too before you return to city life . " " Do n't discourage him , Father , " Sylvia said . " I 'll take him to the guest coop now . " Willis had never thought of Sylvia in this environment ; she seemed surprisingly adjusted to it . When they were in the guest coop , she kissed hire . It was not much of a kiss because he struck his head against a two-by-four on the roof . " Just remember , " Sylvia whispered , " it 's only a split second geo-logically . " Willis always prided himself on being able to get along with  |p237|peo|ple  even if their interests were quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had succeeded with the Hodgeses in a measure . But he had never been in a group in which he had felt so inadequate . He would not have minded the simple life if it had been simple , but the Hodgeses neglected the advantages of simplicity and the small creature comforts understood by practical campers . Not one of them knew how to split kindling for the stove properly or how to keep the stove going once it was lighted , and what was more , they honestly did not care . Hardly a breath of air stirred in the pine grove , the sun 's reflection glared at them from the glassy surface of the lake , but the Hodgesesdid not heed the heat or the gnats . All the Hodgeses cared about were ideas and talk . One minute they were telling jokes in French and next they were lapsing into German . Then suddenly they would be discussing the immoralities of the Emperor Tiberius and early Christianity in the Roman Empire , which led to the subject of Byzantine influence . The minds of the Hodgeses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake . They all talked at once  --  Mrs. Hodges , Sylvia , Mary , Laura , and Tom . It seemed to Willis that Mr. Hodges was the only one who listened , but he too enjoyed every minute of it , and he too would occasionally leap into the discussion . Admitting it was all worthwhile , Willis could find no ending and no beginning . It seemed that Laura and Tom and Mary had just returned from Europe and they had stayed , as the Hodgeses always had , at a small pension in the rue de 1'Universite . Remembering what Sylvia had said about this place , Willis glanced at her sympathetically , but Sylvia seemed to have forgotten that she had complainedof it . She was listening to Tom give what she called a " free lecture . " Instead of being bored by it , Sylvia exhibited a deep respect for Tom . The inevitable conflict was starting already , Tom was saying , between Nazism and Communism . A decadent capitalistic systeminevitably turned to Nazism as a last resort , like the Franco forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You agree with that , Willis , " Tom said , " do n't you ? Intellectuallyif not emotionally ? " It was very hot , and Willis kept wishing they would go for a swim but no one suggested it . " I guess this is all a little over my head , " Willis said . " I only know what I read in the papers , like Will Rogers . " He laughed and everyone laughed too , briefly and sympathetically . It was a great relief when Sylvia finally asked him to go for a walk . It had suddenly dawned on her that Willis had not seen anything of the lake , and this fact seemed to dawn on everyone else too at the same instant . " Why , Willis has just been sitting here , has n't he ? " Mrs. Hodges said . " I hate to miss any of this wonderful talk , " Willis said , " but I would like to take a walk . " Almost the only time the Hodgeses were silent during his visit was when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very hot and he stumbled occasionally over pine roots . " You have to watch where you 're going , " Sylvia said . " This is an awfully rough path . " " You get a beautiful view from it , " Willis said . " Willis , dear , I 'm so proud of you , " Sylvia said . " Everyone thinks you 're wonderful . Mother and Laura have said so already , and Mary wishes Tom could be more like you . You 're having a good time , are n't you ? " " Yes , " Willis said , " it 's great to get away from the city and get some new ideas . " " Ca n't you stay for a day or two more and not go back Sunday night ? " " I wish I could , " Willis said , and he stumbled over another pine root . " It 's been quite a while since I 've been walking in the woods . " " You have to get used to it , " Sylvia said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose he is , " Willis said . " I guess I ca n't blame him much . " " Oh , dear , " Sylvia said , " I did n't mean it in that way , but he probably will try to draw you out . You do n't mind if he draws you out , do you ? "  |p239Of  course he and Mr. Hodges would have to have a little talk sometime , but Mr. Hodges did nothing about it until Sunday afternoon , and then it happened unexpectedly . " Say , Wayde , " Mr. Hodges said , " are you any good in a canoe ? " Willis 's father had taught him to paddle , one summer when he had been working for paper interests in Ontario , but once you learned a thing like that , you never wholly forgot it . There was another of those silences while Willis and Mr. Hodges stepped off the porch and pushed the Hodgeses ' canoe into the water . Willis was feeling tired by then , because he had not slept well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swimming . You could tell from the moment anyone picked up a paddle whether or not he knew about canoes , and Mr. Hodges must have learned somewhere besides Lake Sunapee . " You 've been with Indians sometime , have n't you ? " Mr. Hodges said . " Yes , sir , " Willis answered , " with my father once in Ontario . " " You must have watched them , " Mr. Hodges said . " You can always tell . I made quite a study of Indian paddling in Minnesota once . " Willis was not surprised , because it seemed to him that Mr. Hodges knew something of everything . " If Horace could ever have been in a canoe , he would have liked it , " Mr. Hodges said . " Horace , sir ? " Willis said . He thought that he must have missed a name somewhere and that perhaps Mr. Hodges had a brother named Horace . " The Latin poet , " Mr. Hodges said . " Oh yes , " Willis said , " Horace . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't be , " Mr. Hodges said . " Never be afraid of Horace . Sylvia tells me you 're making ten thousand dollars a year . Do you hope to make some more ? " " Yes , sir , " Willis said . " And I think I will , if what I 'm doing turns out right . " " Sylvia says you have something to do with machine belts . "  |p240Seated  as he was in the bow of the canoe , Willis could only hear Mr. Hodges without seeing him . " Yes , sir , " he said , " it 's the only thing I really know about . At least I hope I do . " " I do n't , " Mr. Hodges said . " My mind 's a blank when it comes to belts . " " Well , sir , " Willis said , " frankly mine 's a blank when it comes to Horace . " " Dear me , " Mr. Hodges said , " there have to be zeros somewhere . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . That 's the trouble with money , there must be a lot of zeros . " Willis wished he knew whether Mr. Hodges was being funny or serious , but it was a good remark and one Willis always remembered . Mr. Hodges had been right . You had to sacrifice a lot of things if you made money . " Last May , sir , " he said , " I met a friend of yours in New York  --  Mr. Hawley , president of the Hawley Pneumatic Tool . " " Hawley , " Mr. Hodges said , " Hawley  --  oh yes . I did n't like him very much . " " I did n't like him much either , " Willis said , " but I would n't like to have him know it . " " Well , " Mr. Hodges said , " I 'm glad you did n't . Sylvia tells me you 're reading the Five-Foot Shelf of Books  --  fifteen minutes a day . Why ? " Willis could not turn around . He hoped that he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow in a canoe . " I wonder , " Mr. Hodges said before Willis could answer , " if you 're doing that to please Sylvia . I would n't if I were you . Women are intellectual snobs , but I would n't let that worry me . " " No , sir , " Willis answered , " I 'm doing it for myself . " " Well , " Mr. Hodges said , " I confess it shows initiative . " Neither of them spoke for a while , and Willis was glad to listen to the dipping of the paddles in the water . " I 'm afraid , " Mr. Hodges said , " you 've taken quite a beating this week end . Do you still like Sylvia ? " " Yes , sir , " Willis said . " It 's been very interesting here . "  | " I 've been interested too , " Mr. Hodges said , " but then you 'd expect me to be , would n't you , in my position ? Sylvia 's always been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed so unexpectedly that Willis missed a stroke . " Perhaps I could do with a few myself . I would n't mind some electric light and some water here , within limits . If I may say so , if I were you I would n't try too hard to be something that I 'm not . Perhaps we 'd better turn back now , or Sylvia will be wondering where you are . That was almost the only serious conversation that Willis ever had with Mr. Hodges , and he always felt that Mr. Hodges had learned more about him than most people did  --  too much , perhaps . He was glad that he had been able to fix up that camp for the Hodgeses eventually , with electricity and running water , with an electric stove , a refrigerator and a dishwasher and even with a small inboard motorboat , and chairs that you could sit on without pain ; yet Willis was never positive that Mr. Hodges had liked these improvements . The last time that Willis ever saw the lake was when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had seemed to him that Mr. Hodges had been watching , and Willis remembered his short laugh when he had spoken about zeros . The last time Willis Wayde had seen the Hodgeses ' house on Craigie Street was when he took Sylvia and their eldest son , Alfred , to the Harvard-Yale game in late November , 1950 . The idea had been Sylvia 's more than his . He had a business meeting in New York about five days ahead of the game date , and since he was in New York he had planned to stop in Boston to talk over some refinancing ideas with his friend Jerry Harwood , president of the Shawmut Insurance and Accident . They might say he was crazy in Chicago , but he still liked doing business with the Boston crowd . Then , just when his plans were shaping up , Sylvia had suggested the Harvard-Yale game . She had pointed out that Alfred had started in at Middlesex that autumn and that it would be nice for Willis to show him the Harvard buildings and to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get used to the idea that he might be going to Harvard . Also it might be that Tom and Mary and their children would be going to the game too , and Tom and Mary might be able to put them up in Brookline . Willis had drawn the line at Brookline . At least he could be comfortable when he was making a business trip , and be able to relax between conferences . However , he did want to see Alfred , and he certainly understood how Sylvia felt about Cambridge . He was delighted to have Sylvia make the trip with him and he set up the schedule accordingly . He was able to get a suite for the week end at the Ritz in Boston , and Hank Knowlton , the New England representative , got three good seats on the Harvard side and a Cadillac with a good driver , even though Sylvia had suggested a Drive-Urself car . The only complication was a small company cocktail party arrangedby Hank in the sitting room for late Saturday afternoon so that he could meet a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time belonged to Sylvia and Al , who would stay with them from Saturday noon on through Sunday . He had even agreed with Sylvia to have Sunday lunch with Tom and Mary and their children in Brookline , as long as they drove there comfortably in the rented Cadillac . He had been in conference for two hours with Jerry Harwood on Saturday morning , and he was feeling pretty tired when he got back to the sitting room at the Ritz and found that Al had already arrived . " Well , hello , Al , " he said . " How 's tricks ? " Al looked as neat as a pin , because Sylvia had given him a good going over in the bathroom . IIe wore gray slacks and a brown tweed jacket , and he looked like a miniature college boy already . " Hey , Pops , " Al shouted  --  he could never keep his voice down when he was excited , when do we eat ? " " Right here and now , " Willis said . " Lunch is coming right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jeepers creepers , " Al shouted , " do we have to eat in this dump ? Ca n't we grab a hot dog somewhere ? "  | " We 're going to eat right here , " Willis said , " and the car 's coming to take us to Cambridge in half an hour . " " Jeepers creepers , " Al shouted , " you do n't mean we 're going to the game in some old Cadillac ? " " Do n't shout , " Willis said . " I can hear you perfectly . What other means of transportation would you suggest ? " " Ca n't we go in the subway , " Al asked , " and push along with the crowd ? " " The subway would take us right to the Larz Anderson Bridge , " Sylvia said . Willis sighed and sat down . " Even if it 's a hardship we 're going in a car , " he said . As a matter of fact , due to traffic congestion it was advisable to leave the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over the Larz Anderson Bridge . Willis felt unusually happy being there with Sylvia and Al . He was particularly glad that Sylvia was wearing her coat of wild mink . It was better-lookingthan any other coat he observed in the crowd around them . As they approached the Charles River the landmarks were partly familiar and partly new . On his left the magnificent blocks of brick houses , the gift of the late Mr. Harkness , had become an integral part of the scene . The buildings of the Harvard Business School across the river , which had been aggressively new when he had been there , had been softened by the winters . It looked as though it would rain during the second half of the Yale game , but fortunately the rain held off . Willis had not been caught by the contagion of the crowd . Instead he had been trying to follow his old footsteps made over twenty years ago . He was the Willis Wayde of the present , and it was time to find the Cadillac , which would be waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway station at Harvard Square . They could reach the Cadillac in ten minutes if they hurried , and fortunately all the football crowd was now in a hurry to get somewhere . There was that little gathering of a few associates for cocktails in the suite at the Ritz . You could not be casual about such things , and you were always judged by the wayp244they were handled . Sylvia and Al would give it a pleasant homeliketouch  --  people were always pleased when you introduced them to the family . It was later than he thought by the time they found their Cadillac , and it was a great relief to be sitting beside Sylvia and Al , out of the crowd at last . " Willis , " Sylvia said , " before we go back ca n't we drive down Craigie Street ? " " Now , Sylvia , " he told her , and he found himself speaking carefully , " it 's in just the opposite direction and we really should be at the Ritz on time . " " It 's only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Al has never seen it . " " Has n't he ? " Willis asked . " Come on , " Al said , " let 's go , Pops . " " All right , " Willis said . " I thought of course he 'd seen it at some time or other . " And he told the driver to drive slowly when they finally reached Craigie Street . Except for the traffic , Brattle and Craigie Streets had not changed much . " There used to be a drinking fountain for horses here , " Sylvia said . " Do you remember ? " " No , " Willis answered . " What drinking fountain ? " " Perhaps it was n't here when you were , " Sylvia said . Somehow you always thought of Cambridge in autumn and winter without leaves on the trees . The street lights were on and the early dark of late autumn was beginning to obscure the outlines , but Craigie Street looked about the same and the old Hodges house had not changed at all . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate glass of the Cadillac side-window , that he was gazing at an exhibit in a museum case . It was still that durable beige color , the same sodden tint as the dead grass on its little square of lawn , and the same bare syringa bushes grew by the front steps . " Well , " Willis said , " there it is , Al . That 's where your mother used to live . " " Gosh , " Alfred said , " did Mommy used to live in that old shack ? " His young voice startled Willis.  | " That 's no way to talk , son , " he said . " That 's where your grandfatherwrote his book . You 've seen it in the library , have n't you ? " " I 'll bet you 've never read it , Pops , " Al said . " It 's all about old sandstone . " " I have n't read it all , son , " Willis said , " but that 's because I 'm not bright enough . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concord Avenue in a moment , but the memory of the house seen through the plate glass was still there . " Well , I guess he did n't make much money , " Alfred said , " or he would n't have lived in a shack like that . " Willis wished that Sylvia were not there . " Money is n't everything , son , " Willis said . " Your grandfather was a professor . Professors are n't expected to make money . " " I guess he was n't as much of a success as you , Pops , " Alfred said . Willis felt his cheeks grow hot . " That is n't so , son , " he said . " Your grandfather was more of a success than I 'll ever be . Maybe I 've made more money , but money is n't everything . " It was curious to be facing truth on Craigie Street and to be telling it to his and Sylvia 's son . All at once Sylvia put her hand over his and he was very glad she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I wish we could have done more for them . " " You did all you could , dear , " Sylvia said , and this was true . " Sylvia , " he said , " is my mother 's photograph in my suitcase ? " " Yes , dear , " Sylvia said . " That 's fine , " Willis said . " I was afraid that maybe I 'd left it in the St. Regis . We 've got to get it out as soon as we get back . " He pressed the button that automatically opened the window behind the driver . " And now take us to the Ritz , " Willis said . It was almost impossible to believe that Sylvia and Al and he had driven down Craigie Street in a Cadillac , even if it was not his own , and he had a sense of uneasiness . He could not call it discontent . There were too many things to think about that had nothing to do with the Ritz . " Sylvia , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 've ever met old Jerry , but he is n't hard to talk to . IIe has ap246son in Harvard , and he 's president of the Shawmut Insurance and Accident . We had a very interesting talk this morning . " Exactly what was success , he was wondering . Perhaps it was nothing tangible but rather a state of mind that made you contentwithin the frame where life had placed you.  |p247THE  YEARS immediately preceding the entry of the United States into the Second World War formed the most critical and important period in the entire business career of Willis Wayde . Willis became increasingly aware that he had traveled during all that time along the narrow line that always divides business successfrom failure , and the wavering thinness of that demarcation still filled him with amazement . He could think of a dozen separateoccasions when any deviation from his course would have led him to disaster , and a number of individuals would have rejoiced at his defeat . You could not be loved by everybody when you reorganized a firm like Rahway Belt . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion and select them with thoughtful care , because it was important to select enemies as carefully as friends . It was strange , when Willis looked backward , that the business turmoil of those years  --  the reorganizing of Rahway Belt , his leaving Beakney-Graham , the new plant construction with its financial problems , and the promotion of the Planeroid line  --  all frequently seemed simpler than many aspects of his private life . It was all very well to say , as so many men he knew kept saying , that business and home should never mix . They invariably did . They always ran together blurring outlines , no matter how carefullyyou might try to separate them . Although nothing was really settled after that week end at Lake Sunapee , Willis discovered that Sylvia thought a great deal had been . Shortly after this visit she bought several books on cooking and began making out hisp248laundry list and going over his shirts and his socks whenever she visited his apartment . Thus the idea of imminent marriage came over them by degrees , making another problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of Lydia I-lembird , who finally telephonedone evening when Sylvia was at Tenth Street . There was nothing serious about Lydia at all , which explained why Willis had never mentioned her to Sylvia . Sylvia had come up with him to the apartment after dining at Tony 's , and she had been reading a cook book to herself . He had told her that he had to go over the refinancing report on Rahway Belt . He was right in the middle of the proposed common-stock setup , which demanded more close thinking than anything else ( because even if the common stock had never paid a dividend , it was the key point in any future situation ) , when the telephone on the writing table rang , and it was Lydia Hembird . " Hello , Willis , darling , " Lydia said , " are you up there all alone ? " " Oh , hello , " he said , " hello . " " Why have you gone completely out of my life , darling ? " Lydia said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy lately . " " He saw that Sylvia had closed the cook book , and he smiled at her reassuringly , but Lydia was still speaking . " Darling , why do n't you come up here right now ? " she said . " I 've got to hang up , " Willis said . " I ca n't talk to you right now . " There was a frigid silence when he set down the telephone . " I 'm sorry , Sylvia , " he said . " It was only someone I used to knowbefore I knew you were in New York . " Sylvia was white and tense and her voice was lightly brittle . " Why did n't you ever tell me about her ? " she asked . " I 'm sure I do n't want to interfere with anything . " " Listen , Sylvia , " he said . " There is n't anything to tell about her . She 's just someone I used to know . " Sylvia drew a sharp , quick breath . " Willis , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you think we can get married . "  |p249Willis  squared his shoulders . The subject was up again and he knew that he had been avoiding it unconsciously . " Now , Sylvia , dear , " he said , " I 'm glad you brought this up , because it 's been on my mind as much as yours . " He could not understand why he felt so nervous , except that he was dealing with a long-term future and life and love and all sorts of other things that were hard to express . " I 'm glad I brought it up too , " Sylvia said . " It 's awfully hard for a girl to be so indefinite . You do love me , do n't you , Willis ? " " Of course I love you , " Willis said . " Then sit here and hold my hand , " Sylvia said , " and do n't look so worried , Willis . You want us to get married , do n't you ? " It was not the way , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course I want us to get married , honey , " he said , and he smiled at her and patted her hand , " but I do have a lot of other things on my mind right now . " " But , Willis , " she said , " do n't you think that this is more im-portant ? " Willis found himself patting her hand again . " Absolutely , honey , " he said . " It 's the most important thing in the world , and because it is , I want things to be set . " " But are n't they ? " Sylvia said . " I do n't see why we ca n't get married any time . " " Well , naturally , " he said , " of course we could , Sylvia , but for example , I 'd like to wait until we know whether I 'll be working for Beakney-Graham or whether I 'll end up out in Rahway . " " Why , Willis , " Sylvia said , " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just give you a rais e of two thousand dollars ? " " Sylvia , sweetness , " Willis said  --  it was always harder to explain business to a woman than to a man  --  " if the Rahway Belting Corripanywould make me an offer and give me some common stock , I 'd leave Beakney-Graham , because there would be a better future in Rahway . " He could not understand why Sylvia should look troubled , butp250then perhaps a woman 's mind always worked differently from a man 's . " But they sent you there to Rahway Belt , " she said . " Of course they sent me there , " Willis answered , and he tried to keep any trace of impatience out of his voice , " but I want you and me to have a future , dear . I do n't have to stay with Beakney-Graham . " " But , Willis , " she asked him , " do you think that 's being loyal ? " He did not intend to be impatient , but she should have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It simply showed that Sylvia did not know where loyalty began or ended . " You would n't say that , " he said , " if you understood the picture , Sylvia . I 'm earning every cent that Beakney-Graham is paying me , and more besides . I ca n't help it , can I , if I 'm making a place for myself in Rahway ? That 's the way the world is , and it has n't got anything to do with loyalty . " He did not mean to get excited but her whole point of view was preposterous . " You 've got to let me attend to these things , dear , " he said , " and let me decide what 's loyal and what is n't . What are you crying for , Sylvia ? " There was no reason whatsoever for Sylvia to sit sobbing , with tears rolling down her cheeks , when he was trying to carry on a sensible conversation . " Oh , Willis , " she sobbed . " I did n't mean to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of you that I do n't want  --  I do n't want  --  " " Now , there , Sylvia , " he said , and he took her in his arms . " just let me do the worrying . Do n't forget it 's a pretty tough world , honey . Everything 's going to be all right . Old Jacoby wants to have a talk with me . Ile 's asked me to his house to lunch next week . Everything 's going to be wonderful . " " Oh , Willis , " she sobbed , " of course you 're loyal . " Loyalty was the damnedest thing . It was something that kept cropping up in business at eccentric intervals , and it kept requiringa different definition . At any rate , he had made his point and he had never had to argue in just that way with Sylvia aboutp251loyalty again . You had to do the best you could with loyalty . She had stopped crying , and he gave her a clean pocket handkerchief . It was always significant when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant . At the very least it meant that he considered you socially suitable to meet the family , and it might also be a gesture that marked the end of mere acquaintance . It signified a decline in watchfulness and a lowering of barriers . It was a time of trial and testing for both guest and host . In spite of the months that Willis had been working closely in Rahway with Mr. Manley Jacoby , Mr. Jacoby had never invited him to his home . Mr. Jacoby had been slightly apologetic when he finally invited Willis . He had been meaning , Mr. Jacoby said , to ask Willis up to the house for quite a while , and he was sorry that he was asking him home for the first time in order to have a business talk , but things always got around the plant , and he had a few words to say to Willis which were confidential . " I guess you know already what they are , " Mr. Jacoby said , " but at the same time I 'm inviting you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Henry Harcourt 's invitationslong ago . " It 's very kind of you , sir , " Willis said . " Thank you very much . " " Mrs. Jacoby wants especially to meet you , " Mr. Jacoby said , " and I want her to sit in on the conference . " Willis knew by then that Mrs. Jacoby was the daughter of the late Mr. Seth Wilfred , a financier whose name was still very well known around the Oranges , and that she had inherited a very considerable sum of money at her father 's death , so much in fact that Mr. Jacoby could have retired at any time he wanted during the last few years . Willis also knew that the Jacobys had two married daughters , one living in Chicago and the other in Philadelphia . There was no reason for Mr. Jacoby to make any explanationsbut it was like him to have done so . Promptly at half past twelve Mr. Jacoby put on his black alpaca coat and climbed behind the wheel of his old Buick . " Get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I ought to have ap252chauffeur , but I guess I 'm independent in some ways . You have to be with anybody like Mrs. Jacoby . I suppose you 've heard she 's pretty rich . " " Yes , sir , " Willis said . " You ca n't help hearing things like that . " " That 's right , " Mr. Jacoby said . " I suppose that Jack Meister or Peters told you , and since we 're going home to lunch I 'd just as soon you 'd call me Manley . " It was hard for Willis to call old men by their first names , and to stay respectful and at the same time familiar . " Mrs. Jacoby  --  Edie , that is  --  makes me pretty comfortable , " Mr. Jacoby said . " We live in the old Wilfred house , you know , built in 1900 out of field stone sort of like a pudding . Maybe you can guess what it 's named . " Willis tried to laugh easily . There was a purpose , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be particularly careful . " You 'd better tell me , Manley , " he said . The first name sounded so awkward that he was afraid he had used it too soon . " I 'm no good at guessing . " " The name is Rock Crest , " Mr. Jacoby said , and he laughed , too . " The great thing about a stone house is that it 's always warm in winter and cool in summer , " Willis said . " Yes , that 's a fact , " Mr. Jacoby answered , " and we have quite a view from it . " It was a grim house , standing on a lawn decorated by canna lilies on the ridge of basalt that rose behind the Oranges . Even its porte-cochere was built of lumpy field stone , but the view was magnificent . It was a warm hazy day in mid-September , and you could see the buildings of downtown New York miles away across the marshes , rising dreamily through the mist . " It rolls out like an Axminster carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed out of the car . " I told you it was a view . " It was all different from anything that Willis had imagined . After the plainness of Rahway Belt , he could not help but be surprised when a manservant opened the door . " Hello , " Mr. Jacoby said , and he looked like a small-townp253visitor in his black alpaca coat . " Is Mrs. Jacoby downstairs yet ? " " Madam is in the east room , " the houseman said . Willis saw many other houses like Rock Crest later . They were too large to live in now but so firmly built that they withstood destruction . They were survivals of the hopeful income-taxless age at the turn of the century , an age which apparently had producedthousands of successful individuals who thought that the mode of life they knew would remain unchanged for centuries . It was startling now to observe the remnants of their culture , now that no one was sure how long he would live anywhere . The past and the ambitions of the late Mr. Seth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings of Rock Crest . His desire for display must have exceeded that of most of his contemporaries . He must have been an arrogant , selfmademan of a species which could not exist today , for no selfmademan that Willis had ever met would have dared to express his personality so flamboyantly . The east room , as it was called , took up two stories and must have been intended to represent a baronial hall . There was a balcony at one end which was occupied by musicians , as Mrs. Jacoby told him once , when her father had receptions for the directors of the Erie Railroad . There was also an immense pipe organ that no longer worked and a huge fieldstonefireplace . There were some heads of African animals on the walls and some sentimental pictures of cows and sheep and another of French aristocrats going to the guillotine . The floors were covered with Oriental carpets and the furniture was imitation French . " Quite a little room , is n't it ? " Mr. Jacoby said . " I thought it would surprise you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . " " It certainly is remarkable , " Willis told him . " You get used to it , " Mr. Jacoby said . " But I remember the first time Edie brought me in here to meet the old man . He was in a wheel chair but I was scared . Edie  --  oh , there you are . " Mrs. Jacoby was seated on a sofa by the fireplace , and her lacy beige dress gave her almost a protective coloring . Her face , which was pale and distinguished , reminded him more of an old man'sp254than a woman 's . Her hair was snow white , but her eyebrows were black and bushy , and her eyes were deep brown . She spoke in a precise , almost English way , because , as she told Willis later , she had been taught at a convent school in France . " I 'm delighted to meet you , Willis , " she said . " I 'm calling you Willis because Manley has told me so much about you . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and he tried to act as though he were not astonished by anything around him . It all went to show that no matter how well you knew someone in business , you could not tell how he lived until he took you home . " You must n't blame Mr. Jacoby for any of this , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " He married into it quite late in life , and what could we have done except tear the whole thing down ? " " I see what you mean , " Willis said , " but everything 's very in-teresting . " " " Manley , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " if I send Henry upstairs for something else , will you take off that black alpaca coat ? Look how nice Willis looks . " " He 's a new model , " Mr. Jacoby said . " You know I like this coat . " " Manley never wants to forget he 's a small-town boy , " Mrs. Jacoby said , and she looked unblinkingly at Willis . " Perhaps you 've noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insists on holding onto that one-horse factory . He does n't need to , but he likes to be independent and he ca n't keep on being , with his arthritis . That 's why I asked him to bring you up here  --  so I could look at you . " Willis was partially adjusted to the surroundings by then . For a short while the experience had been like falling by mistake into cold water , but now he had reached the surface . He was thinking that Mrs. Jacoby reminded him of someone in the past . He could not remember who until he thought of Mrs. Blood , but Mrs. Jacoby was more masterful . Ile could not help wondering why she had ever married Mr. Jacoby , who , as she said , was a small-town boy , and what accident had brought them together or what spirit of revolt had made her seek him out , but then perhaps Mr. Jacoby had been young and attractive once.  | " How would it be if we had cocktails , Edie ? " Mr. Jacoby said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice and you 'd get to know Willis better . " " Not for me , thank you , " Willis said quickly . " I do n't usually drink in the middle of a business day , Mrs. Jacoby . " " Well , I 'm going to ring for Henry , Edie , " Mr. Jacoby said . " I 'm going to have a Scotch and soda . " " As long as you take your medicine with it , Manley , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " Go ahead and have your Scotch and soda . I want to talk to Willis . " Mrs. Jacoby walked over to a mother-of-pearl-inlaid table and picked up a sheaf of papers bound in a handsome morocco cover and Willis gave a slight start . It was the final report and recommendationsby Beakney-Graham for the Rahway Belting Company . " Now , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " We may as well sit down and we can start going over this before lunch is served . Manley tells me that you wrote most of it . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was helped by other members of my company , and of course we had engineering and technical assistance . " Mrs. Jacoby picked up a pair of heavy horn-rimmed glasses . " I read this with great interest , " she said . " It 's a well-organized report . I told Manley to employ Beakney-Graham . " The light from Mrs. Jacoby 's glasses glittered disconcertingly as Willis tried to think of a suitable answer . " I had an idea that the bank had suggested our company , " he said . Mr. Jacoby laughed in a brief and rather mournful way . " They did , " he said , " but Edie suggested it to the bank . She wears the pants around here , or at least she tries to . " " I wish you would n't get off these tiresome jokes , Manley , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " I 've always let you play around with that factory of yours and I 've never interfered , except when it 's been absolutely necessary . " Willis was glad to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a silver tray and a decanterand tumblers , all of heavy cut glass , because the interruptiongave him a moment to think over the situation . " Manley , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " be sure to take your medicine first , and I 'll have some Scotch too . Are you sure you wo n't change your mind , Mr. Wayde  --  I mean Willis ? " " If you 'll forgive me , I 'd rather not , " Willis said . " I 'm afraid a lot of that report must have been dull reading , Mrs. Jacoby . " He was interested to see that Mrs. Jacoby drank her Scotch neat , following it by a little water as a chaser . " I would n't say that any reports are light reading , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " but my father trained me to manage my own affairs . Oh , I know what you 're thinking . " " I was n't thinking anything , Mrs. Jacoby , " Willis said , and he tried to look through the reflection on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jacoby answered . " I know just what men think when old women say they handle their own affairs . They think they 're being silly . Well , I 'm not silly . " " I 'm sure you 're not , Mrs. Jacoby , " Willis said quickly . " I 'm sorry you thought I was thinking any such thing . " " Maybe you were n't , then , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " Manley says you 're very quick . " " That 's right , " Mr. Jacoby said . " He 's smart . Do n't underrate him , Edie . " " My father  --  that 's Mr. Seth Wilfred , you know  --  always said never underrate anyone until you knew him , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " and I do n't know you well enough to underrate you yet . I want this first meeting of ours to be frank . I 've personally managed all my father 's interests since his death . I got out of the market in August , 1929 . I got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my own offices upstairs . " " That 's right , " Mr. Jacoby said . " Edie 's a very able woman , Willis . " " Now , Manley , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " I wish you 'd step outside for a minute , but as long as you wo n't you 'll have to let me do the talking . " Mr. Jacoby laughed again , in a short , resigned way.  | " I brought the young man here , " he said , " for you to talk to him , did n't I ? " Since his days at the Harcourt Mill , Willis had seen a good many rich men , and he was beginning to judge their abilities and weaknesses , but he was not so familiar with the wealthy and independentwoman . These people , he had always supposed , were under the care and guidance of lawyers , bankers , and investment counselors , as Mrs. Blood and Mrs. Henry Harcourt had been . Althoughhe could see that Mrs. Jacoby was different , he still could not define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty was that she talked partly like a woman and partly like a man . " Now you know as well as I do , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " that Manley here has n't got much business sense . " Willis found himself laughing nervously . " Oh , I would n't go so far as to say that , " he said . " I did n't say you would , " Mrs. Jacoby told him , " but you know it and Manley knows it too . You have ideas in your report that I 've known all along . Manley has surrounded himself with second-rate people . He has vision but no business sense . " Willis glanced at Mr. Jacoby and was surprised to discover that he was smiling . " Now , Mrs. Jacoby , " Willis began , " I 'm not in any position . . but Mr. Jacoby interrupted him . " Now , you see , Edie , " he said . " I told you he was good . " " You do n't need to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get right down to facts . I 'm worried about Manley , Mr. Wayde  --  I mean Willis . He 's always liked that factory . He owned it when I married him . I want him to keep it if he likes it , but he 's got to have someone to help him . I think it 's time for you to make him our proposition , Manley . " Mr. Jacoby coughed loudly . " Edie 's right , " he said , " and we 've got to have her on our side . She 's got the money , and it looks as though we 're going to need some . " " Never mind that , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " Make him the proposition , Manley . "  | " All right , " Mr. Jacoby said . " Edie and I want you to be executivevice president of Rahway Belt . We want you to take over so that we can have time to go to Arizona and places like that . We 're not getting any younger , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons-in-law , both of whom are doctors . This may sound sudden to you but Edie and I have been all over it . We . want to sort of take you into the family . Are you sure you do n't want a drink ? " " Well , yes , " Willis said , " perhaps I would n't mind a small one . " He had been right not to have refused that final proffer of a drink . His acceptance finally set the tone for everything . " Thank you , Manley , " he said , as Mr. Jacoby handed him the glass . He had been right in calling Mr. Jacoby by his first name , as Mr. Jacoby had suggested , but he also had been right in speakingslowly and shyly . " Would you mind telling us , " Mr. Jacoby asked , " what your salary is at present ? " " Why , no , " Willis said . " It 's ten thousand dollars , " and he smiled at them . " Just at present . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He paused . Somehow people always paused before they made an offer . " You and I get on all right . You 'll be executive vice president down there and I 'll back you all the way . You 'll get twelve thousand dollars a year and thirty-three per cent of the common stock . " Although it was the percentage that Willis had planned to ask for , he had never thought that Mr. Jacoby would go so far immediately . " That 's quite a lot , " Willis said slowly  --  " the stock , I mean . " " The idea , " Mr. Jacoby said , " is to fix it so you wo n't refuse . " Willis waited a moment . It was no time to be too eager . In factthe size of the offer made him suspicious . " I 'm very much flattered of course , " he said . " I did n't know you thought so highly of me , Manley . " He noticed that Mrs. Jacoby had taken off her glasses . " It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jacoby said , " it 's never earned me one red cent , and I want Manley to be happy . "  |p259It  was no time to hurry , and Willis took a deliberate sip of his Scotch and water . " I think it 's very generous of you , " Willis said . " There 's only one thing that makes me hesitate . " He smiled a little sadly . It was like saying he never took a drink in the middle of a business day , and he could see how closely they both were watching him . " Another firm sent me here , you know . I 'm not sure it would be loyal , under the circumstances  --  " He allowed his voice to trail into silence , and he had a momentarythought of Sylvia . " Now just a minute , " Mr. Jacoby began , " just a minute . " Willis raised his voice slightly , and as he did so he felt a glow of self-righteousness and a warm spot in his heart for Beakney-Graham . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd like to finish my thought , if you do n't mind . There 's a girl I want to marry . I wish she were here with us now , because I know you 'd like her , Mrs. Jacoby . She 's the daughter of a Harvard professor . I met her in Cambridge when I was at the Harvard School of Business Administration . She and I were talking about loyalty only the other night . I do n't know whether Sylvia would think it was loyal of me if I were to leave Beakney-Graham . " Willis had that quick feeling of triumph that comes of having said exactly the right things . Mrs. Jacoby was smiling at him . " Manley always told me you were high-minded , " she said , " but he never told me you were thinking of getting married . " " That 's because he never told me either , Edie , " Mr. Jacoby said . Willis laughed diffidently . " It 's been a secret up to now , " he answered . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're older than I am and I 'd value your advice . I would n't want either of you to think I 'm disloyal . " He was glad that he had thought to ask their advice , because Mr. and Mrs. Jacoby began advising him simultaneously . " You 're not under any contract with them , are you ? " Mrs. Jacoby asked . " Oh no , " Willis said , " no contract , but just the same it bothers me.  | " And since when , " Mr. Jacoby asked , " ca n't anyone leave a job and take another ? " " I know , " Willis said . " But Mr. Beakney 's been especially kind to me . You know what a fine straightshooter he is yourself , and I have some very close fine friends in the office . We 're a pretty handpickedcrowd in Beakney-Graham . " " Now listen , Willis , " Mr. Jacoby said . " It 's time you thought about yourself and this girl you 're going to marry . What is her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia , " Mrs. Jacoby repeated . " I want you to promise to bring her here , and I think fifteen thousand would be better than twelve , Manley . " " It is n't the money , " Willis said . " I only wish I felt right , Mrs. Jacoby . " " Now , Willis , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " this is common sense . It 's time you thought of Sylvia and any little ones who may be coming along . " Willis was always glad that he had threshed out the matter of loyalty with Mr. and Mrs. Jacoby , because it had started them off on the right foot , and he had Sylvia to thank for it , although she had only seen the picture in a rather schoolgirlish way ; and what he had done was for her future as much as his . Nevertheless , sometimes when he had a sleepless night , he would recall his final conversation with Mr. Beakney . He was still sorry that things had ended there with a certain amount of ill-feeling . His interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ever encountered up to that date , but , if you had to go through with something , you had to go right through . Willis had ( lone his morning setting-up exercises as usual , the " Daily Dozen " designed by the late Walter Camp which he had found long ago in a popular magazine , and he had always liked the title  --  " Take a Tip from the Tiger and Stay Young . " Willis had recently been through an optional annual physical examination , which he had passed with an A rating . His eyesight was 20/2o , his weight was right , his arches had not fallen , and his heart , bloodp261pressure , and muscle tone were excellent . After a cold shower he had put on his new gray flannel suit , because he wanted to look as smart as possible . He had even taken fifteen minutes before he had gone out for his breakfast of orange juice , a three-minute boiled egg , and raisin bran , to read from William Penn in the Harvard Classics . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was going to say to Mr. Beakney , but there was no reason to break routine . He had exchanged pleasant greetings with everyone at Beakney-Grahamjust as though it were only another September day , and had all his thoughts well organized when Mr. Beakney was ready to see him . " I thought you were out at Rahway , " Mr. Beakney said . " Is anything wrong out there ? " Everything was fine at Rahway , Willis had told him . Then he had given Mr. Beakney the whole picture concisely , without pullingany punches , and he had ended on a note of how grateful he would always feel to Mr. Beakney and everyone in the office . He would never forget what they had clone for him but he hoped that Mr. Beakney would put himself in his position and understand his situation . He was always very sorry that Mr. Beakney had not understood . " Well , " Mr. Beakney said , " so that 's it . You 've been sucking up to a silly old man and his silly old wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry you look at it that way , sir , " Willis had told him . " They 've made me an offer and I 've accepted it . " Then Mr. Beakney had talked about loyalty , but he could not get away from the basic single fact that Willis was under no contract to stay with Beakney-Graham . " Let me ask you just one question , sir , " Willis said . " Have n't you ever done what I 'm doing yourself , in your own career , Mr. Beakney ? " He did not like the look that Mr. Beakney gave him , but it was better than any answer . " I never thought you 'd do this to me , " Mr. Beakney said . " I had other ideas about you . "  | " I 'm sorry , sir , " Willis said . " I 've given it a lot of thought , but I guess this is something that everyone has to do sometime . " " Maybe , " Mr. Beakney said . " I fear it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ethics , Willis . " " I 'm sorry you do n't approve , sir , " Willis said . " That 's neither here nor there , " Mr. Beakney said . " I fear you 've grown up to be too much for us to handle . Well , that 's the way things go . " " I wish you would n't put it that way , sir , " Willis said , " because I 've always enjoyed working for you . " " All right , " Mr. Beakney said , " let 's not have any more last words . I 'll only say you 're graduating , and I 'll make just one more remark which maybe is a compliment . I 'd hate to run up against you in a controversy ten years from now . " This meant a lot coming from someone like Mr. Beakney . There was no wonder Willis always had a warm spot in his heart for Beakney-Graham . The next few months of his life were among the busiest and happiest that Willis had ever known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first taste of tangible success and achievement . He only realized later that success had its dangerous aspects , especially early success . Class presidents and football heroes , he had finally come to learn , required careful and suspiciouswatching . They were like the potted hyacinths and daffodils that he sometimes bought for Sylvia in midwinter  --  spectacular , but they often yellowed around the edges once you brought them home . The same was true with bright young men who had come along too fast . They were tired because of prematureeffort , or else overconfidence had made them arrogant . At best the cards were stacked against someone who made good too young . Willis could see now that he had once been in this same dubious category . He could no longer wonder , as he once had , that Mr. Beakney had made no effort to keep him . In fact Mr. Beakney must have been relieved to have let him go  --  gray suit , trimmed hair , polished Oxfords , sharp mind and everything  --  because he had come along too fast for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodges . It was the most fortunate thing that had ever happened to him , meeting and marrying a girl like Sylvia . Sylvia had better taste than he , better manners and a more cultivated mind . She knew so many things he did not know that he could not help but be very proud of her . Though he was aware of his inadequacies when he was with her , somehow she never made him jealous . They were married in Cambridge in October , 1936 . There was always a first time for everything . Willis had no idea of the immediatecomplications . He had not thought of his father and mother as traveling all the way from the West Coast to the wedding until Mrs. Hodges wrote him that she had asked them and that they were coming , and then he had to get them rooms and a room for himself at the Hotel Commander in Cambridge . Then Mrs. Hodges had posed another problem . He had envisioned a small house wedding with no one but the family , but Mrs. Hodges wanted them married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the maid of honor , and Sylvia was selecting bridesmaids . Consequently Mrs. Hodges wanted to know at once whom Willis would invite to be best man and whom he would want for ushers . Willis never realized until he read Mrs. Hodges 's letter at RahwayBelt that in all his years in New York there had not been much time for friendship . Under other circumstances , he could have asked Joe McKitterick and one or two others from BeakneyGraham , but his having left rendered this impossible . This lack of friendship , which had never troubled him before , he felt was something he could not confess to Mrs. Hodges and least of all to Sylvia . He finally felt obliged to resort to bald misstatement when he answered Mrs. Hodges 's letter . He simply had to say that the few people he most wanted were unable to leave New York in the middle of the business week , that his father could be best man but that he would have to dispense with ushers . He had thought that getting married would involve only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be there several days ahead to see about the license and to attend a few small parties which her friends and Sylvia 's were giving ;  |p264and  then there was the wedding trip , to which he had given no thought at all , but Sylvia had said that they must go somewhere . This was all very difficult , coming on top of everything he had to do at Rahway Belt , and yet as Mr. Jacoby pointed out , after all it might only happen once . If Willis had no friends of his own , at least he wanted to appear in a proper light . His Ford runabout , which had seemed so desirableonly that spring , was not what he wanted any longer and he turned it in for a new green Buick sedan before he motored up to Cambridge . He never forgot Sylvia 's expression when she saw the car in front of the house on Craigie Street . Sylvia always did find it hard to understand that you were rated in a business way by the car you drove and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way always had to measure you by something . Sylvia ran down the path to meet him in the late afternoon when he arrived at Craigie Street . He remembered her brown skirt and her white shirtwaist and the rustling noise of her feet among the autumn leaves . Now that she was back in the family she did not look like the girl he had known in New York , and when she kissed him in a shy way , because everyone was watching them , he felt like a distant relative . " Why , Willis , " she said , " where 's the Ford ? " Where was the Ford indeed ? He was very glad that he could surprise Sylvia at a time like that . " Why , I turned in the Ford , dear , " he said . " This is an improvement , is n't it ? " After all , he did not want to say in so many words that a **32;8584;TOOLONG did not drive a Ford . " Oh , dear , " Sylvia said , " I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot better , " he told her , " once you get behind the wheel . I 've been babying it along , but after two hundred miles more we can run it as fast as we like . I ca n't wait to knock off those two hundred miles . " " Oh , darling , " she said , " I hope people wo n't think we 're throwingour weight around when they see us driving it . " " Why , sweetness , " he said , and he slammed the car door casu/ally , " it 's only a Buick . You wait till we get a Cadillac before you start to worry . " " Oh , darling , " she said , and she linked her arm through his , " we 've all been waiting for you all afternoon , and your father and mother are here , and you 've got to go down right away to see about the marriage license . Tom will take you . And you 've got to see the presents . What do you think Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , and it was a lot more important than the Buick . Sylvia laughed in an embarrassed way . " An enormous silver soup tureen , like a pyramid , and I do n't know what we 'll ever do with it . " It did not matter what they did with it . It was very kind of Mr. and Mrs. Jacoby . Getting married , Willis often thought , was like moving without any preparation into a foreign country about whose customs one knew nothing . From the moment he had stepped out of the Buick to the time Sylvia and he finally drove away in it from the wedding reception , he was a stranger in a strange land . Everything was on an entirely different basis from what it had been before , because the Hodgeses were trying to make him a member of the family , and even his father and mother were like strangers . They were all waiting for him in the house at Craigie Street , and he was surprised to have Mrs. Hodges kiss him . Then his mother kissed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , who told him they might as well get it over with now that he was going to be an in-law just like her . Sylvia wanted to see him alone for a minute and so did his mother , because he was her boy and she had n't laid eyes on him for four years , and he had n't seen his father yet . No one seemed to know what had happened to Alfred Wayde and Mr. Hodges . They had simply disappeared . Mrs. Hodges wanted Willis to see the presents right away , but Tom said Willis had to go to the city hall to see about the license before the whole place closed . " If he does n't get to City Hall today , he wo n't get married on Wednesday , " Tom said . This was plain fact , but Willis found that Sylvia was pulling him into Mr. Hodges 's study.  | " Willis , " Sylvia said , " what are you going to get married in ? " " In a church , are n't we ? " Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I mean clothes , " Sylvia said , and Sylvia looked strained and nervous . " Well , wo n't a dark suit do ? " he asked . " No , " Sylvia said . " Mother wants you and your father to wear cutaways . " " That 's the first I 've heard of it , " Willis said . " Nobody wore them at Lake Sunapee . " " It 's just Mother , darling , " Sylvia said . " She 's all worn out . Youand your father will have to go and rent them , with silk hats . " " Silk hats ? " Willis repeated . " I do n't know whether I can get myfather to do it . " " He 's got to , " Sylvia said . " And , Willis , have you got the ring ? " " Gosh , " Willis said , " I forgot about the ring . " " You forgot it ? " Sylvia said , and her voice broke tragically . " I suppose getting married is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Do you want to marry me or do n't you ? " " Now , sweetness , " Willis said . " Of course I want to marry you , or I certainly would n't have bought the Buick . " " Willis , " Sylvia said , " if you mention that Buick again , I 'll scream  --  I really will . That Buick has n't got anything to do with any-thing . " " It 's only sort of a symbol , dear , " he said , " sort of like the ring . " " You come here to get married , " Sylvia said , " and all you think about is a motor car . " He knew it was a time to be patient and inderstanding and that girls were apt to be upset at such a time , but the trouble was he did not know what he ought to understand . " You have n't even asked to see the presents , " Sylvia said . It certainly was a time to be gentle and understanding , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame Sylvia , because he was growing nervous too . " Now listen , honey , " he said . " What 's all the trouble anyway ? " At any rate the question changed her mood.  | " Oh , Willis , darling , " she said , " I know I 'm impossible . I 'm sorry , dear . " " There , there , " Willis said , and he put his arm around her . " It 'll be all right when this is over . What sort of a ring would you like , honey ? I saw sort of a cute platinum one the other day with little orange blossoms carved on it . " " Oh , God ! " Sylvia said . " Why did n't you think of chromium ? " " Why , sweet , " Willis said , " why chromium ? " " Because it 's all over that Buick , " Sylvia said , and she hid her head against his shoulder . He could not tell whether she was laughing or crying , but at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thinking of something striking , sweetness , that would go with the diamond , " he told her . " Oh , Willis , " Sylvia said . " Just put your mind on a plain gold band . I 'll go to Boston with you tomorrow . " He was relieved to see that she was growing calmer . " Willis , " she said , " have you done anything about the bouquet ? " " What bouquet , sweetness ? " Willis asked . " Oh , God ! " Sylvia said . " The bunch of flowers the girl carries to the altar . The man is supposed to buy it . " " Is he ? " Willis said . " I did n't know that , honey , but just you leave it all to me . " " Just do n't tell anyone I had to tell you , " Sylvia said . " Now , sweetness , " Willis said . " I 'm sorry I 'm so dumb , but I have n't been married very often . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Just you wait till you see the bouquet I 'll get you . It will be solid orchids . " " Oh , God ! " Sylvia said . " Oh no , not orchids . " He was glad that Tom interrupted them . If they did n't go for that marriage license they would never get it . " And we 'll take your car , " Tom said . " It 's like a motor hearse . I 'm dying to ride in it . " It might not have been a very good joke but it did put things on a lighter level . " Come on , " Tom said , " and you 're coming too , Sylvia . Where did you get that suit , Willis ? "  | " Brooks Brothers , " Willis said . " What 's the matter with it , Tom ? " " I 'm only admiring it , " Tom said . Sylvia turned on Tom sharply . There was no doubt she was very nervous . " You 'd better admire it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a friend of the Little People , you can afford one like it some day . " There was so much happening that Willis could never get events into chronological succession . He was constantly smiling and chatting with friends and relatives of the Hodgeses ' whom he did not know . Sylvia was always saying in amazed tones that she surely must have told him who they were . Although he took pride in sorting out names and faces , it actually took years and several christenings before he got the Hodgeses ' connections straight . So this was Willis Wayde , they were saying . They had heard so much about him that they were very glad finally to see him . Sylvia had always been a wonderful girl . In case he did not know it , he was very very lucky to have found a girl like that . He knew he was very lucky , he answered . They were going to live in Rahway , New Jersey . They had not found a house yet , but they would stay in his apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying , it would be great fun to go house-hunting and buy furniture and things . Yes , he and Sylvia would motor around New England for two weeks , but they had no definite idea just where they were going . Even his parents treated him sometimes like a stranger . His mother was shy with him at first . She had been worried , she said , as any mother would be , when Willis had written her that he was engaged to a girl she did not know . It was wonderful to discover that Sylvia was just the daughter-in-law she had dreamed of having  --  agood , sweet , sensible , intelligent girl , whom she seemed to have known always . Her family were all lovely people , too , particularly Professor Hodges . She had never thought that a professor in a great university like Harvard would have such democraticmanners or that she would understand nearly everything he said . She told Willis all this when they were finally alone in the hotel.  | " You 've grown up so , Willis , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Willis look handsome , Alfred ? " " Yes , " Alfred Wayde said . " He 's been polished off , all right . How about a touch of rye , Willis ? " " Now , Alfred , " Mrs. Wayde said , " I wish you 'd ever been polished . " " Anyway you 're getting me into a monkey suit , " Alfred Wayde said , " just because Willis is getting married . " He was referring of course to the cutaway he was going to rent . Ever since he had heard of it he had not been able to get it off his mind . " Now do n't keep complaining about it , " Mrs. Wayde said . " You know you 're proud of Willis . " " Why , yes , " Alfred Wayde said , " I 'd like to see this Jacoby who 's giving him fifteen grand a year . " " Mr. Jacoby would n't have given it to Willis if he was n't worth it , " Mrs. Wayde said , " and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Alfred Wayde said , " and I 'm proud to have a boy who can shake money out of anyone . " He stopped and looked at Willis in a way that made Willis move uneasily . " I 'm proud of you all right , son . Here you are , not thirty , with motor cars , golf sticks , everything . There 's only one thing bothers me about you , son . " " Well , tell me what it is , " Willis said . " A lot of things bother me about myself , as a matter of fact . " Alfred Wayde filled a pipe and lighted it . He looked older and heavier than he had at the Harcourt Mill , and all his motions were more deliberate . " Now , son , " he said , and his voice was warm and gentle , " I know you 've got to get along like all the rest of us . Boys like you have to try to be something they 're not in order to get ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be what you want to be . You 're marrying a real nice girl . She 's a little thin for my taste , but no doubt she 'll flesh out . There 's only one thing bothers me . " He stopped and lighted his pipe again . " Just do n't get too smooth , " he said , " or you 'll turn into a son of a bitch . A lot of people do before they know it , son . "  | " Alfred , " Mrs. Wayde said , " you ought to be ashamed . " " I 'm sorry , " Alfred Wayde said , " I apologize if I offended you , son . " You did n't , " Willis said , " and I know what you mean , and you said it before to me once . Do you remember ? " " That 's right , " Alfred Wayde said , " up at Harcourt . I did n't mean to be repeating myself . And the Harcourts sent you presents , did n't they ? Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was nice of them , considering . " " Yes , sir , " Willis said , " it was very nice of them . " " Well , " Alfred Wayde said , " I 'm going to bed now . My feet hurt in these new shoes . " He pushed himself out of his chair , walked slowly across the hotel sitting room , and slapped Willis on the shoulder.  |p271WILLIS  ALWAYS liked to think that Sylvia 's and his honeymoon had been a very happy one , and certainly before it was completedthey had learned a lot about each other in little ways . He had learned , for instance , that Sylvia liked to smoke a cigarette in bed before she went to sleep , a habit which always alarmed him , and that she left shoes and slippers on odd parts of the floor , which one had to be careful not to step on . In fact Willis had almost dislocated his toe on a sharp heel of one of Sylvia 's mules the third night of their marriage , and Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had insisted on walking around barefoot . Sylvia on her side had learned that he did setting-up exercises for ten minutes every morning and never left the top off his toothpaste tube or his shaving cream . Things like this meant more than you thought , and a honeymoon was surely a period of learning both to give and forgive . He had never known , for instance , that Sylvia wore pajamas instead of nightgowns . He had heard that the most important recipe for a happy honeymoonwas complete physical comfort , and he was glad he had taken this point seriously in spite of what Sylvia had said about economy . He had the good sense not to worry about costs , since , as he told Sylvia , you only had a honeymoon once . He had not told Sylvia where they were going because he had wanted it to be a surprise , and as a matter of fact it had been , very definitely . All he would tell Sylvia was that he had reservations at a place in the Adirondack Mountains and that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach there on time . The name of the place was Chieftain Manor , which Willis hadp272once heard Mr. Beakney say was one of the finest rest and recreationhotels that he had ever seen , and Mr. Beakney certainly had been right . Willis had never been to a hotel like Chieftain Manor , and he often said sadly to Sylvia in later years that he wished they might go there now  --  which was unhappily impossible , because Chieftain Manor closed its doors shortly after Pearl Harbor , never to open them again . It lay back in the past now , as something unique to remember , something never to be spoiled by revisiting later when one 's tastes were better formed by wider travel . Chieftain Manor was gone , and heaven only knew what had finally happened to the immense shingled building or the eighteen-holegolf course , the indoor and outdoor swimming pools , the bungalows and service quarters , the mountain trails and boathouses . Had the hotel burned down , or was it the property now of some real-estate development with ranch-type houses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled back over it again ? Willis did not know , nor did he want to know . He preferred to think of it as it had been  --  as beautiful as a dream of wish fulfillment . He could seem to see it in his memory just as he had when he drove up over its half mile of driveway with Sylvia beside him . He could remember the autumn sunlight , the gold of turning poplars against the deep green of fir trees . Perhaps the past had given his memories a romantic tinge , but his initial impression persisted that Chieftain Manor contained everything that anyone could need in order to achieve happiness . It certainly had tried to contain everything . Once you passed through its front portals that overlooked the putting green and croquet lawn , there were passages branching off in all directions to shops selling linen and lingerie and jewelry , sport shops , book shops , barber shops , and hairdressers , cigar stands , newsstands , conservatories , and a broker'soffice . As Willis once said facetiously to Sylvia after they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to memory , it must have been that no one coming to Chieftain Manor had decided what to wear until he got there . He was sur/prised that Sylvia had not appeared amused . Occasionally there were times when Sylvia had not been quite herself at the Chieftain . October was like July , what with the club bar , the golf professional , the card room , the billiard room , the ballroom and the Club Evangeline with its New York atmosphere , and the Turkish baths , and the indoor swimming pool so cozily heated . The sun was setting and the red glow from the sky was reflected in the still waters of the lake . There was a suspicion of autumn chill that was only enough to make one glad that a day 's motoring had ended at just the proper moment . The Manor was really larger than Willis had believed was possible , considering how far they were from anywhere . " Oh , Willis , " he heard Sylvia say , " is this it ? " " Yes , honey , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? " " This is n't a hotel , " she said , " it 's a fantasy . " " A what ? " he asked her . " Oh , never mind , dear , " she said . " Is n't it going to be terribly expensive ? " It was strange how apt Sylvia was to miss the point of certain things . For instance she never could understand when it was worthwhile to spend money . Of course the main purpose of ChieftainManor  --  or The Old Chief , as Willis came to call it affectionately  --  wasto be expensive . It was a symbolic prize for industry and endeavor , a happy resting place only for those who had made good . Somehow Sylvia never seemed to see that if you worked hard for what you got , it was a pleasure to show that you had money . It never hurt you at all , for example , to be able to say that you enjoyed April at Hot Springs or that you had found that the service at The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known of it last . Of course everyone had his own intimate attitude toward money , and he always realized that Sylvia 's was different from his , but he did wish she could understand that he had earned his right to be at The Old Chief . " What 's the matter , honey ? " he asked her . " Oh , Willis , " she said . " It 's just so  --  Oh , never mind . I only mean that it is n't very cozy . "  | " But it is n't meant to be , " he said . " People who come here do n't want anything cozy . " And then he could not help but laugh . " I 'll make you love it , honey , " he said . " We 'll do something new every minute we 're here . This is going to be a real honeymoon right from now on in . " There was no time to say anything more because a bell-boy in a horizon-blue monkey jacket and white trousers was already ' beside the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take out everything , will you ? And put the car in the garage . " It was new to him , but then Willis had traveled enough at Beakney-Graham to know his way around hotels . Thus The Old Chief only awed Willis when he and Sylvia first crossed the lobby , with its artistically grouped clusters of chairs occupied by the guests in from golf or riding who were whiling away an aimless hour before it should be time to dress for dinner . By the time he was facing the room clerk he was completely sure of himself . " Mr. and Mrs. Willis Wayde , " he said , " Rahway , New Jersey . Here 's a confirmation of my reservation . " The only wrong thing that he had done , of course , was to tell the clerk that he had a confirmation for his reservation , since this indicated an insecurity that he always avoided afterwards . Actuallythis made very little difference , because , as Willis found out later , the whole staff had been given careful lectures by Mr. Murcheson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A guest , as Mr. Murcheson said  --  and he always made it a point to contact all guests personally  --  was a member of The Old Chief Club once he had signed the register . Upon leaving the desk Willis was already able to glance in a calm and friendly way about the lobby . The cashmere sweaters of the younger women reminded him that given the proper things Sylvia could look as well as any of them , and Sylvia was beginning to wear clothes beautifully , as well or better even than Bess Harcourt . They had the elevator all to themselves , with the two boys and the baggage.  | " You have suite C-i6 , sir , " the head boy said . Willis saw Sylvia glance at him with alarm , and he smiled at her proudly . " That 's right , son , " he said , and it was right . The beautifully carpeted hall was almost perfect and so were the sitting room and bedroom , tastefully furnished with chintz and antique maple reproductions . " Thank you , boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar , and smiled again at Sylvia . " Look , " he said to her . " Flowers for you with a card from the manager . Well , how do you like it , Mrs. Wayde ? " If he had meant the suite to be a surprise , it had been , but Sylvia 's uneasy manner told him that her mind was again on money . " Willis , " she said , " we do n't need a sitting room , do we ? Really , you 're spending money like a drunken sailor . " Somehow the phrase seemed inappropriate and he resented being put in this category . " Listen , honey , " he said . " Let 's just sit down and get this straight , " and he put his arm around her . " Darling , " Sylvia said , " I do n't mean I 'm trying to quarrel . I know this is lovely and I love you for thinking of it , but then there 's all the money we have to spend for the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " do you remember that green dress ? " It was lovely to see the color rise in her cheeks . " Of course I do , " she answered , " but now we 're so much more responsible . " " That 's right , honey , " Willis said , " but I still feel just the same way I did about that dress . I guess I always will . " " You 're awfully sweet , darling , " she said . She said it as though she had made a new discovery , and the warmth of her voice made him happy . " It is what makes the game worthwhile , honey , " he said . " I mean giving you things , having a home . " All at once he began to laugh , because finally he had the whole idea straight . " Maybe peoplep276like me are like sailors , and do you know why drunken sailors spend their money ? " " No , " she answered , " unless because they 're drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they do it because they know that money 's meant to spend when they get ashore . " " And you mean you 're ashore now ? " she asked . " That 's right , " he said , " but there 's more to it than that . This place means more to me than it does to you , because I 've been at sea . " Then her arms were around his neck and her head was on his shoulder . " I 'm awfully glad you told me , dear , " she said . " I wo n't worry any more . We 'll have a lovely time . " Sylvia always was a grand girl , once you made her understand , and of course they had a wonderful time . Sylvia 's evening dress was not bad-looking at all , and he was wearing his new tuxedo . It was pleasant to see people glancing at them as they walked across the lobby , with looks more wistful than envious ; and Willis could understand their attitudes better now that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remember when he and Sylvia were like that  --  in love and with years ahead of them . Sylvia was dark and tall and there was character in her face and intelligence that meant a lot more than insipid beauty . Then he was not so bad-looking himself either in those days , as he knew from old photographs . " Shall we have a cocktail before dinner ? " he asked . " Yes , of course , " Sylvia said . " Darling , I keep forgetting how handsome you look , and then I start wondering how I ever found you . " A waiter pulled back a chair for her at a table in the bar , and the happy released chatter of drinkers around them splashed over them like a wave on a coral beach . " Will you have a dry Martini , dear ? " he asked . " Make it two dry Martinis , son , and ask the barman just to squeeze a lemon peel over the surface , not drop it in . " It occurred to Willis after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and that it had been inappropriatep277to call him son , and he made a mental note to use the word less frequently . " I do n't care what it costs now . This is fun , " Sylvia said . " And when we finish these drinks it will be more fun , " Willis told her . " Honey , I want to tell you something . " " What ? " she asked . " You said an awfully sweet thing about me as we came in here . " He had to raise his voice to make her hear him across the table . " I mean about your forgetting how I look and then remembering . Let 's keep on forgetting . Let 's never get used to each other . " " Anyway , let 's not get too used to each other , " Sylvia said . " All right , " he said , " and , honey , you 're more than wonderful , you 're more than beautiful . " " We ought to stay here permanently , " Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Sometimes he echoed that wish in his memory , that they could have stayed on in that bar forever with no more than two Martinis apiece . " You see , " he said , and he wished he did not have to speak so loudly , " you 're more than beautiful because you have  --  you have  --  I wish I could say it in French . " " Do n't , " Sylvia told him . " You 'll spoil it if you do . " " I know , honey , " he told her , " and some day you 're going to take me to Paris and teach me how to speak it right . You 're more than beautiful . You 're distinguee . " " Why , Willis , " she said , " you pronounced that rather nicely . " " Excuse my French , " Willis said , and he laughed . " I wo n't say it again , honey , but I will say you 're more distinguished than any other girl in this hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you think we ought to have two ? " Sylvia asked . Willis laughed again . " A bird ca n't fly on one wing , " he said . They looked at each other and then Sylvia smiled . " Darling , " she said , " do you think I 'm as distinguee as Bess Har-court ? " He was startled when Sylvia brought up Bess Harcourt , because it was neither the time nor the place for it , and also her namep278evoked a picture and a comparison . He could not help but wonder what Bess Harcourt would be like if she were suddenly to enter that spacious barroom . Would she be handsomer than Sylvia ? " Willis , " Sylvia said , " did you hear my question ? " He had forgotten momentarily where he was , and now he was back holding the stem of the glass of his second Martini . " Oh , yes , " he said , " beg pardon , honey . There is n't any comparison . You 're both different in your ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they ? " " You know , I saw her once , " Sylvia said . " I do n't believe I ever told you . I may have been shy about it . " " I do n't see that it 's anything to be shy about , " Willis said . " Where did you happen to see her ? " " Oh , at a Boston dance , " Sylvia answered . " She was pointed out to me . " " Well , frankly , " Willis said , and as he was speaking he could imagine Bess Harcourt at that vanished dance , with her tawny hair , greenish-blue eyes , and quick smile , " you 've got a better figurethan Bess . You 're better-looking than Bess . You 've got more brains and a better disposition . " And then he laughed . " Of course I may be prejudiced . " Sylvia laughed too . " Just you keep on being prejudiced , " she said . The fine thing was that Willis had meant everything he said . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette case and snapped it open . " This silver case is going to turn to gold , " he said , " when things get a little better . Have a cigarette , honey ? " " Yes , " she said , " but do n't you think we ought to go in to din-ner ? " Willis lighted a match for her and he made a note as he did so that he must save some of the Chieftain Manor matches to take back to Rahway . " Nobody else seems to be in a hurry , " he said . " Let 's get up an appetite . Remember , it 's all American Plan . " He looked critically around the barroom . Already he felt like a habitue of Chieftain Manor.  | " Wait a minute , honey , " he said , " do n't interrupt me . I think there 's someone over there I know . Yes , it is . I 'm sure of it . " " Who ? " Sylvia asked . " That 's Mr. Percival L. Nagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rather heavy blond lady . Yes , I 'm sure it 's Mr. Nagel . " " Who 's Mr. Nagel ? " Sylvia asked . " Why , honey , " Willis said  --  she might know how to speak French but she did not know everything  --  " P. L. Nagel is the president of the Simcoe Rubber Hose and Belting Company . " It was always something to remember , the time he saw P. L. Nagel sitting across the room at Chieftain Manor . It all went to show that you never lost money in the end by staying at a fashionablehotel , and it also went to show that it paid to cultivate a knack for names and faces . The only time that Willis had seen P. L. Nagel previously was during an unforgettable episode back in Mr. Harcourt 's library , but that had been a long time ago , in terms of both years and personal development . Mr. Nagel did not look quite so trim or quite so ruddy , but then seven years had passed since Mr. Nagel had called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardness of his face had partiallymelted into his jowls . In fact he had put on weight all over , although his double-breasted dinner coat concealed a good deal of his portliness . His hair , which had been receding from his florid forehead , had thinned until his shiny scalp showed through what was left of it , and what was left was benignly white . It was undoubtedlyP . L. Nagel . " Well , " Willis heard Sylvia saying , " and suppose he is the president of the Simcoe Rubber Hose and Belting Company ? " Sylvia 's voice was a needless interruption . " They make conveyor belts in the Middle West , honey , together with a long line of industrial rubber products , " Willis told her , and he told her very kindly . " They 're the biggest belting company in America , honey . He tried to buy the Harcourt Mill once . That 's how I remember him . " " Is that his wife with him ? " It pained Willis that Sylvia sounded disdainful . Of course thep280lady with him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not possibly have been anything else . It was not difficult for Willis to see that Mrs. Nagel 's blond hair was not entirely natural . In spite of facials and beauty creams , her eyes were old , and so were her hands . She was doing very well , but she was hardly the person that one would invite for a surreptitiousweek end at Chieftain Manor . " Well , she looks very common , " Sylvia said . It was hard to see how Sylvia had reached that conclusion . It seemed to Willis that Mrs. Nagel looked very well , considering  --  handsome , blond , in a fine evening dress , with some excellent pieces of jewelry . " I do n't suppose he remembers me at all , " Willis said , " but I was right there when he offered to buy the Harcourt Mill . He offered five million dollars . " This sum made no impression on Sylvia . " I do n't see why it is , " she said , " that people like that always seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five million dollars . " Willis only half heard her because the sight of the Nagels had absorbed all of his attention . It was simply one of those times when he could not think of two things at once . " Nice-looking people , " Sylvia said , " never seem to want to buy things for five million dollars . " Willis felt a slight spasm of annoyance . " Now , honey , " he said , " in business it does n't matter how anybodylooks , if he has the money to put on the table . " " But , Willis , " Sylvia said , " you 're always careful about how you 're going to look . " Willis laughed . " Honey , " he said , " maybe I wo n't care so much if I ever make a million . 1 think I ought to speak to Mr. Nagel . Do n't you think so ? " " Why ? " Sylvia asked . " It would be a wasted opportunity if I did n't , dear , " Willis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out things for Sylvia in those days.  |p281He  pushed back his chair tentatively , and just then Sylvia spoke with a startling sort of urgency . " Oh , Willis , " she said , " please do n't . " He could still remember that Sylvia 's voice had sounded half frightened . " Do n't what , honey ? " he asked . " Do n't contact him , or whatever you call it , " Sylvia said . " We 're having such a good time by ourselves . " Her words moved more rapidly , more eagerly . " Willis , he 'll spoil everything . " Willis patted her hand , gently , reassuringly . " Do n't worry , honey , " he said , and suddenly he felt curious . " What is it that upsets you so about my just speaking to him ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " Sylvia said . " I just do n't feel he 's good foryou . " " Who ? " Willis said . " Old P. L. Nagel not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden catch in her voice  --  " I do n't want you to get to be like him . That 's all I mean . " " Who ? " Willis said . " Me ? Like P. L. Nagel ? " There really had been a moment when he hesitated , since after all it was their honeymoon . There was even a moment when he knew what she meant about getting to be like P. L. Nagel , and then he stood up . " I would n't do this , honey , " he said , " if it was n't important in a business way . I 'll be back in just a minute , honey . " As he walked carefully around the tables toward Mr. P. L. Nagel , he had some vague idea of what Sylvia meant . For a secondWillis seemed to be leaving something that he and Sylvia were building together which had all sorts of half-realized possibilities . It was , of course , ridiculous . In the end it was more of a twinge of conscience than an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant . Willis squared his shoulders slightly . He was near the table now . Mr. Nagel was staring at an empty old-fashioned cocktailglass , but he looked up quickly as one does , finally , when someone silently tries to attract one 's attention . " Good evening , Mr. Nagel , " Willis said . " I do n't imagine you remember me but I could n't resist the impulse . " Mr. Nagel 's timing was slower than it had been years ago.  |p282Willis  could see him bringing his mind and eyes into focus and for a moment Willis was afraid that Mr. Nagel resented the intrusion . Willis had not learned then that everybody , no matter what superficial annoyance they might show , liked to be recognizedand noticed . " Now just a minute , son , " Mr. Nagel said . " Do n't tell me who you are . I want to guess . I never forget a name and a face , do I , Myrtle ? " He looked archly at Mrs. Nagel . " It depends on how many old-fashioneds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mr. Nagel shrugged his shoulders . " Now , Myrt , " he said , " I bet you two hundred dollars I guess him . " " How many guesses ? " Mrs. Nagel asked . " Just two , " Mr. Nagel said , and sat up straight . " All right . First question . Were you ever in the belting business , son ? " " Yes , sir , " Willis said . " I was and in fact . . . " " Just answer , " Mrs. Nagel said . " Do n't tell him any more . " " All right , Myrtle , " Mr. Nagel said . " I do n't need any more questions . This is Jim Budd who used to be in the Chicago office . I remember you perfectly now , Jim . Sit down and have a quick one with us , and bring your best girl over . " " Oh , P.L. , " Mrs. Nagel said , and she gave a loud whinnying laugh that made people turn around and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is n't Jim Budd . " " Now , wait a minute , " Mr. Nagel said . " Of course he 's Jim Budd , " but then Willis 's own expression must have told him he was wrong . It was hard to keep from laughing . Mr. Nagel took out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead . " I 'm afraid you 've got inc wrong , sir , " Willis said . " I used to be with the I-larcourts  --  not that there is any reason why you should remember . You had other things to think about at the time . " Mr. Nagel always was very quick on the uptake . " That 's it , " he said . " You were the kid who sat with me in that den . Myrtle , sweetie , this is the son of my very close personal friend Alf Wayde . His first name is Harris . " " The name is Willis , sir , " Willis said.  |p283Mrs  . Nagel gave another laugh . " That 's another one on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pops . " Mr. Nagel shook his finger at her . " Harris is pretty close , " he said , " but I admit the drinks are on me , sweetie . Who 's the girl you 're with , Willis ? She 's a snappy littlebabe , if I may say so . " " She 's my wife , " Willis said . " We happen to be here on our honeymoon . " Mrs. Nagel gave another of her laughs . " There you go again , Pops , " she said . " I told you they were mar-ried . " Mr. Nagel raised his eyebrows and cleared his throat . " You see , " he said , " when Mrs. Nagel and I come to a place like this we always have a little game , guessing who 's married and who is n't . Mrs. Nagel 's usually right . In fact , personally , she thought we were married a whole year before we were . " When P. L. Nagel laughed you could not help but laugh with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gold-mesh bag on the table . " I am sure Mr. Wayde does n't understand what you 're talkingabout , P.L. , " she said . " Now , sweetie , " P.L. answered . " It 's just a private joke of Mrs. Nagel 's and mine . You understand that , do n't you , Harris ? " " Oh , naturally , Mr. Nagel , " Willis said . " I just came over to say hello . It 's been a pleasure meeting you again , and Mrs. Nagel too , and now if you 'll pardon me , I must rejoin Mrs. Wayde . " Mr. Nagel shook his finger at Mrs. Nagel . " Now you see you 've embarrassed him , do n't you , Myrtle ? " he said . " We 're not going to pardon you , Harris , until you bring Mrs. Wayde over here and make this whole thing legitimate . " " Stop calling him Harris , " Mrs. Nagel said . " It would be lovely if you joined us for a cocktail , Mr. Wayde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " let 's get off this formal basis . We 're all first names here . " Willis could not help but feel a pleasant glow and a warm spot in his heart that was almost like loyalty . " I know Sylvia would love to meet you , P.L. , " he said . One al/ways had to be careful in the early handling of a first name , but on this occasion he could see that it was exactly what P.L. wanted . " I 'll bring Sylvia right over . " " Oh , Willis , " Sylvia said , " do we really have to go over there and sit with them ? " It was not fair of Sylvia , because even if it was their honeymoon the Nagels were a very important contact . " Now , honey , " he said firmly but very cheerfully , " it wo n't hurt . It will be over in a minute . " He could see that there had never been an opportunity for Sylvia in her whole life to meet people like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . In fact after a few minutes he was really proud of Sylvia , and what was more she seemed to know instinctively how to handle types like old P.L. When Mr. Nagel kept holding her hand long after it was necessary , it was a little difficult to know what to do , but Sylvia handled it all herself . " I 'd like it back when you 're through with it , Mr. Nagel , " Sylvia said . " I need it so I can have a cocktail . " It was pretty good for Sylvia and it started everything on exactly the right note . Mr. Nagel said it was a very funny line and Mrs. Nagel asked right away if Sylvia and Willis would not join them at dinner  --  that is if they did n't mind sitting awhile with some stuffy old people . " Do n't forget , Myrt , " Mr. Nagel said , " it 's their honeymoon . But you do have to eat sometime , do n't you , kids ? " Willis had a momentary worry that Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was intended , but he was entirely wrong . " There 's nothing like a honeymoon , " Mrs. Nagel said to Sylvia , " and the first one is always the best one . That 's what I always tell P.L. , but let 's you and I have a little talk and do n't mind the men . " " Well , " P.L. said , " now the girls have got together , how 's Har-court 's ? " It was very easy to tell Mr. Nagel the few lines of personal history . Old P.L. knew all about Harcourt 's and Beakney-Graham and Rahway Belt , and he was honestly interested.  | " Anyway , " P.L. said , " you 've got the Planeroid patents . " It was a relief to be talking business again . " That 's right , " Willis said , " but we 're doing some more things to the process . " " Will you boys stop talking business , " Mrs. Nagel said , " and let us please go in to dinner . " You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an intellectual enthusiasm when it came to production and merchandising , and they must have both been a little starved for shop talk . Willis could not remember what they had for dinner or much of what Sylvia or Mrs. Nagel had to say but he could recall all the details of his talk with P.L. Willis could never blame himself for being very proud of that evening . While they drank coffee in the large lounge outside the ballroom , Willis in his thoughts could stand away from himself and enjoy that scene , with its background of ballroom music , as an artist might admire a canvas that was turning out better than he had ever hoped . Furthermore the feeling of well-being that suffused him seemed to Willis to have spread to Sylvia and Mrs. Nagel . Then everyone talked very happily about antique furniture . It seemed that Mr. and Mrs. Nagel had recently built a new home in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest , designed on Georgian colonial lines . For ordinary parties you could have a steak fry or some catch-as-catch-can thing like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you wanted to do it in a small sophisticated way for some banker or some highly educated corporationlawyer . What P.L. really wanted was atmosphere , and that was why they were getting rid of reproductions and buying genuine antiques . They had a patina all their own . It was pleasant to hear Sylvia agree with Mrs. Nagel . Old furnituredid give atmosphere , and she wished that she could afford to buy some , but of course starting out as she and Willis were made this nearly impossible . " Say , " P. L. Nagel said , " do n't let Myrtle give you any fancy ideas now , Sylvia , honey . Speaking of antiques , do you remember old Harcourt 's office building ? Those were real antiques . " Willis was glad that the subject had got back to the Harcourtp286Mill , since he could give a few interesting facts about the commercialvalue of antiques . Finally Mr. Nagel raised his hand and yawned delicately behind it . " You know , this pine-scented air seems to hit me over the head , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hay . How about some golf tomorrow , Willis ? " " Gosh , P.L. , " Willis said , " I 'm intending to do a little serious work on my golf while I 'm here , but I 'm afraid I 'm not in your league , P.L. " " Oh , just duffer golf , " Mr. Nagel said . " I 'm not what I used to be . I 'll call you at eleven , son . Come on , Myrtle . Good night , Sylvia , precious . " Willis was instantly on his feet , and he stood for a moment gazingafter the Nagels before he sat down again beside Sylvia . " Now , honey , " he said , " do you see what I mean about its paying to stop at some place like Chieftain Manor ? " Instead of answering directly , Sylvia put her hand on his arm . " Now that they 've gone , let 's go in and dance , " she said . It was nice to see how quickly Sylvia was getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe that they were one of the few young couples in the ballroom , for most of the other guests , who sat watching the dancers like village elders , were in stages of late middle age . There were not many people in Willis 's age group who could afford the time off for play or the tariff of Chieftain Manor . It was sad to think of this , since The Old Chief had so many facilities that youth appreciated more than age , but at the same time it was stimulating to realize that he was able to make the grade while he was still young . When they finally reached their sitting room , neither of them , unlike P. 1 .. Nagel , felt like sleep . " I think I 'll read for a while , " Sylvia said . " Would you mind gettingme The Oxford Book of Verse out of my suitcase , dear ? " It was like a preview of an abundance of happy years , to be reading quietly there in The Old Chief with Sylvia . Yet after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thisp287conventional picture . No husband and wife ever seemed able to sit in the same room and read . " Willis ? " Sylvia said . " Yes , dear , " he answered . " How is it that someone as stupid and vulgar as Mr. Nagel can be so successful in business ? I do n't see that he has any brains at all , only a few slow reflexes . " " You do n't mean , " Willis said , " that old P.L. pinched you or anything ? " He was relieved when Sylvia laughed . " Why , the thought never crossed my mind , " she said , " but I wish he had . It might have made things easier . " Sometimes Sylvia said the most extraordinary things , consideringshe came from Craigie Street . " Now , honey , " Willis told her , " you 've got to  --  er  --  kind of expect that sort of thing when you get around with old men over sixty , especially if they 're topflight executives . " Sylvia laughed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Suppose he starts , " she said . " How much should I let him pinch me ? " " Well , now , honey , " Willis said , " that 's kind of a curious question . I do n't see any use in crossing a bridge until you come to it , and maybe you never will . " " You mean I 'm not attractive enough ? " Sylvia asked . " Now , honey , " Willis said , " I did n't mean that . I was only sort of thinking out loud on general terms . " " Darling , " Sylvia said , " what will I do if Mr. Nagel does do anything ? " " Well , honey , " Willis told her , and he tried to put his thoughts into order , " I 've always thought that girls knew how to handle such situations . I do n't say it 's pleasant the way certain men behave , but then it 's sort of an accepted human fact . You know , honey , executives around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to feel a little kindly toward them . We ca n't always be young , honey . "  |p288Of  course he really did not believe that last thought , because time , in those days , was entirely in his favor . There was nothing like the Adirondacks to make one sleep when one finally did get to sleep , and there were never more comfortablebeds than the twin beds in their suite at The Old Chief . In later years when Willis read the advertisements of the friendly service of certain large hotels which supplied each guest with a mattress equipped with countless thousands of tiny springs , each spring contributing to perfect posture and slumber , and on the occasions when Willis sometimes tossed restlessly upon these mattressesfar away from home and worrying about some business interview , he often thought of The Old Chief . No air-conditioned room could ever duplicate the gentle breeze off the lake . Sometime in the middle of the night , however , he was awakened by a sound from Sylvia 's bed and at first he had a startled idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that she was laughing . Yet it seemed to him that the hour was inappropriate for joy or sorrow . He could discern the shape of the twin bed across from him , but he could not see Sylvia at all . " Sylvia , " he said , " are you all right ? " " I 'm all right , " she answered through the dark . " I just do n't seem to be able to go to sleep , that 's all . " " Sylvia , " he asked her , " are you laughing or are you crying ? " There was a silence in the room that lasted a considerable time before she answered . " I do n't know what I 'm doing  --  and do n't ask questions , Willis . " " Sylvia , " he said , " you 've got to tell me what 's the matter . " " Oh , please stop it , Willis , " she said . " If it 's anything I 've said , if I 've been too  --  er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her . At last he was sure that she was laughing more than she was crying . " It is n't anything like that , " she said . " You 're awfully sweet , darling , but everything 's so different . " " So different from what ? " And he waited for quite a while before he asked the question . " Oh , darling , " she said , " just so different from anything I thoughtp289anything was going to be . It 's on another plane , but I 'll get used to it  --  only please do n't talk about it any more tonight . " Often Willis said facetiously that his mind was like an alarm clock and that he never needed to put in a call at any hotel switchboard . At any rate he was always awake by seven , and Sylvia was still asleep that next morning , which was another previewof years to come . He was delighted to see that it was a beautiful clear morning . The prospectus of Chieftain Manor had made mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptionthat really made sense . He slid out of bed noiselessly , wrappinghimself in the silk robe which he had purchased especially for the trip , and , carrying Volume II of the Five-Foot Shelf with him , tiptoed to the sitting room . He customarily did twenty pushups , but he did twenty-five that morning , because of the elixir in the air . It was still only twenty minutes past seven when he had finished , ample time for his reading . When his fifteen minutes were up he experienced as he always did a fine sense of accomplishmentthat came of such a combined mental and physical workout , and the indoor swimming pool downstairs was yet to come . He picked up the room telephone , asking for the pool and speaking softly so as not to arouse Sylvia . " Am I speaking to the instructor ? " he asked . " This is Mr. Willis Wayde . If I came down right now could you give me a half-hour lesson with the Australian crawl ? " He was back by ten minutes past eight prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rather ugly blueflannelwrapper over her pajamas , which reminded him that he must take Sylvia shopping as soon as they were dressed . " Willis , " Sylvia said , " where under the sun have you been , wanderingaround in your wrapper ? " " Oh , " he told her , " the usual thing  --  first the old setting-up exercises , and then the Five-Foot Shelf . " " Willis , " she said , " you did n't . " " And then , " he said , " it just occurred to me that I could have ap290swimming lesson in the indoor pool , you know . They 've got a good instructor there . It was a nice workout , honey . " " What under the sun were you doing that for ? " she asked . " Well , " he said , " I 've always wanted to learn the Australian crawl . " " The Australian crawl ? " she repeated . He wondered sometimes later whether he would ever have spoken of that incident at another time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , in Clyde , " he said , " there was a young fellow who could do the crawl beautifully . I saw him do it once in the Harcourtswimming pool after he had whipped me playing tennis . His name was Ed Ewing , the one who married Bess Harcourt  --  not that any of it makes any difference , honey . " And this was true . None of it did make any difference . Bess Harcourt was a memory almost as distant as his days at the mine in Colorado . He simply remembered that Edward Ewing had been very good at the Australian crawl . " But , Willis , " Sylvia said , " I still do n't see why you want to learn it . " It was a rather difficult question to answer now that he was back with Sylvia and calling up room service for breakfast . " Sylvia , " he said , " if we have any  --  er  --  children , we 've got to get a tennis court  --  one of those that dries off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . They must be taught to play tennis , and how to handle themselves  --  er  --  gracefully in a swimming pool . " " You mean , " Sylvia said , " it 's going to help them in a business way ? " He saw that she was laughing at him , but he did not mind . " Well , seriously , honey , " he said , " both in a business and a social way . " He was feeling wonderful . The coffee and the buckwheat cakes and the small order of breakfast steak and the toast and strawberry jam were all wonderful . " And , honey , " he said , " we 'd better lay out our program for thep291day . First I 'll take you shopping . I want to get you some tweeds and a housecoat , and then you and I have both got to have a golf lesson and then I 'm going to play a few holes with old P.L. and then it will be time for lunch . Gosh , I 'm glad we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sympathetic smile from Sylvia , which was the least that he deserved . Instead he was surprised that she looked dubious . " Do n't you think , Willis , " she said , " that if you play golf with Mr. Nagel , we 'll have to keep seeing the Nagels all the time ? " It amazed him that Sylvia could not see the advantages of their seeing as much as possible of the Nagels . " Now , honey , " he said , and he spoke slowly and carefully , because he knew that he was facing an important moment , " there is one thing we ought to get straight , with all kindness and withoutemotion . Please do n't look so startled , honey . " " Then do n't look so stern , Willis , " she said . " We were only talking about the Nagels . " " I wish you would n't say only the Nagels , ' honey , " he told her . " They 're pretty important , potentially , in my business future , but more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of way of life for both of us . " When you came to think of it , that phrase " way of life " pretty well dated the conversation . They were back there in the days beforeWorld War II . They were only just beginning to define democracywithout knowing what the phrase meant . Still it had a solemn ring . " For heaven 's sake , Willis , " Sylvia said , " I did n't mean to upset you , but just what have the Nagels got to do with our way of life ? " " You 're not upsetting me , honey , " Willis told her . " Just please let me encapsulate my thought , because it is a thought . " " What 's that again ? " Sylvia asked . " What were you going to do to the thought ? " " Oh , " Willis said , and he laughed . " Maybe it 's an inappropriate word . We always used to use it back at Beakney-Graham , but never mind it now , honey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you let me run the business end of the combination , honey , and I 'll let you run the home . But the Nagels are business , honey , and you let me run business . " Marriage in the final analysis consisted of a series of adjustments . There was , as that humorist , artist and writer Mr. James Thurber put it , always a war between the sexes , always a kind of competition , no matter how much you loved someone . Somehow he and Sylvia must have worked out those problems more easily than most of their contemporaries . The reason was , he liked to think , that they each had a real respect for the abilities of the other . Right from the beginning he had respected Sylvia 's mind and cultivation , and he rather liked it when she laughed at him about words like encapsulate , but they both finally understood that cultivation did n't get you everywhere.  |p293PERHAPS  THE best way of judging whether or not certain years in your life were happy might be to determine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those in which events blended with each other so naturally that all that remainedwas a recollection of growth and achievement . Judging the early years of Willis Wayde 's and Sylvia 's marriage by such a standard , they were very happy ones . Sylvia and Willis had both been very busy in different ways . The reorganizing of Rahway Belt was combined with all the routineadjustments that most young couples must make . The babies and the obstetrical bills , the buying of furniture , papering the front hall , shoveling out paths to the sidewalk in winter , New Year 's Eves at the country club , formed a disconnected chain of recollection . All their friends  --  the Parkinsons , the Meltons , the Newhopes  --  friends you played bridge with and friends you just had a good time with on general principles , were also interwoven with these events into a general background . You could recall many incidents , but sometimes it was hard , even with Sylvia 's help and with the photograph album , to tell exactly where those incidentsbelonged , chronologically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as peculiar as it seemed , since life in Orange , when they began it , was on the unstable foundations known to all young couples who have to earn a living . None of their friends , for instance  --  like the Parkinsons or the Meltons  --  had the remotest idea that they would live where they were for long . The moment they had higherp294salaries they would be moving . After all , this climbing up the ladderwas all part of the American way . Curiously enough , however , one was not especially conscious at the time of living on shifting sands . To put the thing in purely industrial terms , Willis and Sylvia were in the pilot-plant stage when they lived in Orange , but you learned a lot of things in a pilot plant  --  you spotted the bugs ; you smoothed the edges off generally . When they really went into production Willis realized that they had learned a great deal in Orange . The home which they had rented was a brown-shingled affair standing on an adequate piece of lawn and shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot the hedge or the lawn , because he had tended them both himself out of a natural liking for puttering around . They had selected the house with the help of Mr. and Mrs. Jacoby , who felt it was important for Rahway Belt that the Waydes should live in a suitable neighborhood . It had taken them quite a while to furnish the house , or at least it had Sylvia , since Willis had delegated the whole problem to her , RahwayBelt in those days being at least a twelve-hour-per-diem proposition . His idea had been to budget the whole business and get some store like Bamberger 's in Newark to furnish and decorate for a flat sum , and they could get a loan , if necessary , from the bank . But when Sylvia objected Willis let her do the furnishing herself . This had kept Sylvia fully occupied during the first months of their marriage , not to mention bossing Minnie , their Irish maid-ofall-work , and the result was not too bad . Sometimes he had to urge Sylvia to spend more money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room and a real antique dining-room table , but on the whole he admired her taste . It used to be a lot of fun coming home and examining the new things Sylvia had bought , and he could sympathize , frankly , with Sylvia 's greatest preoccupation . She did not want their house to look like a newlyweds ' home , even if it was . She wanted it to have both a used and cared-for look . Willis had always thought of marriage as a process of settling down , whereas he soon discovered it was a series of disturbances . He did not intend this as a complaint , because many of these ex/periences had been highly enjoyable , such as meeting neighbors , and the first time that Sylvia and he had entertained in their own home . There were invitations to dinner from the Jacobys and various stockholders of Rahway Belt . Then the minister came to call and they promised to attend the Congregational Church . Then the Newhopes , who lived across the street , came to call , and Dan Newhope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the whole if you were friendly with people they were friendly in return , and there was a real community spirit in that neighborhood . Willis learned , in the years he and Sylvia were starting out in Orange , the importance of being identified with the place where you lived and of being a useful individual in it . One was bound to derive real personal satisfaction from being on church committees or collecting for the Republican campaign or helping with festivities at the country club , and eventually such activities paid off in a very practical way . Local bankers and businessmen whom you had never met began recognizing you as a good sound citizen who was willing to give time and energy to a cause , and this recognition in turn helped the standing of the company you represented . After a year or two all sorts of people began knowing Willis pleasantly and the labor at Rahway Belt was kind to him . In fact when the CIO struck the plant Willis never had any trouble with the picket line . This was due in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about everyone who worked at Rahway Belt , but also , he was sure , because he was well-known around town . It hardly seemed any time at all after they had moved to Orange  --  in fact before all the drapes were up  --  that Sylvia announced that she was going to have a baby , except she did n't put it in quite that way . Willis had been making a final check of the Christmas-card list at the office on the afternoon that he found Sylvia waiting for him in the living room . The tea things were ready . Tea had been Sylvia 's idea and one he liked , perhaps because tea always made him think of the Harcourt house ; and their blue china tea set invariably reminded Willis that some day they must get a silver tea service.  | " Willis , " Sylvia said , " the doctor says I 'm pregnant . " He was startled , not so much by the news as by the way that Sylvia had delivered it , so loudly that he knew that Minnie must have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so surprised , Willis ? " Sylvia said . " What did you think was going to happen ? Nothing ? " Willis wished , instead of saying that she was pregnant , Sylvia had said that she was going to have a baby or something of the sort , which would have meant the same thing , but then Sylvia was Sylvia . " Well , well , " he said , " so it looks as though we made it , does it ? " Curiously that simple remark of his seemed to startle Sylvia . " Oh , Willis , " she said , " is that all you 're going to say ? " Then a wave of emotion swept over him . The news made everythingworthwhile , and also it made Willis feel old because he was beginning to march in the procession of generations . " Honey , " he said , " I really think it 's swell . In fact it could n't be sweller . " When he sat down beside her he forgot all the problems of Rahway Belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hope it 's going to be ? Let 's make it a boy ! " And she spoke as though they could make it anything , and then Willis had another thought . " Gosh , honey , " he said , " I 've really got to peel off my coat and go to work now . I want to do something for this kid , no matter what its sex . I want it to have a lot of things you and I did n't have , honey . " Admitted there was something in the maxim that a man with wife and children has given hostages to fortune , Willis never agreed with this entirely . A wife and one or two kids formed a steadying , influence for any young fellow who could afford them . When you got beyond the two-children zone , perhaps things did get a little more complicated , but a wife and one or two kids made you feel your responsibility . In picking young executives , Willis was always partial to family men , as long as their families were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on as the news that ap297baby was born to someone on the office force . It was a fact that drew everyone closer together , and it always paid to make the news the subject of some sort of small festivity , like the presentationof a pair of knitted booties , or something like that , not as a gag exactly but at the same time in the spirit of fun . The appearance of that child was a real event which marked the end of a long period of waiting punctuated by moments of being frightened for , and sometimes even of , Sylvia . The progressive change that came over her gave Willis an inordinate sense of guilt . Yet often when he showed solicitude , instead of being grateful , Sylvia seemed cross . As the months went on she snapped at him more than she ever had before and became critical of details in his habits of eating and speech . Even when he made a practice of bringing her a little gift home every day , Sylvia was very seldomgrateful . " I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " or if you do , wo n't you give them to me naturally and not make an occasion of it ? " " Why , how do you mean , honey ? " Willis asked . " Oh , I do n't know , " she said , " except you make me feel like someone in a shrine . " " Now , honey , " Willis told her , " of course I do n't know what you 're going through but I can kind of imagine . " " No you ca n't , " Sylvia said . " You do n't even know what you 're going through yourself . " Her remark only went to show that Sylvia had lost her balance . " All right , " he said , " all right , but you know I want to help you in any way I can , honey . " " Oh , God , " Sylvia said , and her voice choked , and she began to cry in a very hysterical manner , and then she said for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any more , and then for no obvious reason either she told him she was sorry . " Darling , " she said , " I just do n't know what I 'm saying . I reallydo love and I do respect you , even if you are obvious sometimes . " Sylvia was difficult when she was pregnant , but when Williscompared notes with other men , he found that Sylvia was not exceptional . It was just as well to recognize that millipns of otherp298human beings , past and present , had shared every experience that one went through . There had been a lot of talk about the best obstetrician . It seemed that there were a good many of them in the Oranges , which was as it should be with so many young couples making their first homes there . Mrs. Jacoby recommended one , and the Newhopes , who had more recent experience than Mrs. Jacoby , mentioned another whom Mrs. Newhope called a lamb . His name was Dr. Castlebar , and he had played tackle on a Midwestern football team . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to read thoughtfully  --  might have termed affable , florid , and tweedy . He smoked a straight-stemmed pipe and always referred to Willis as " fella . " Obviously the main part of Dr. Castlebar 's business was to bring babies into the world in rapid succession . Also , since in many ways he acted as a liaison officer between the sexes , his function was highly confidential . Dr. Castlebar 's main idea was seemingly that childbirth and the parental manifestations connected with it were really a lot of fun , at least that was what Dr. Castlebar told them on his first visit . " Now , my dears , " he said , " just remember this whole thing is in my hands , and we 're going to have a lot of fun out of this before we get through . " Sylvia started to laugh in an alarming way . " That 's all right , " Dr. Castlebar said . " Do n't worry about her , fella . Let her have her little laugh out , and go fetch her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Willis never knew what was done in his absence , but when he returned from the kitchen with the water , Sylvia had stopped laughing . She was even talking to Dr. Castlebar in confidential tones . " Now , fella , " Dr. Castlebar said , " if the little lady is ever high- strung , just remember that high-strung women make the best mothers , in my book . But as I was saying , we can all get a lot of fun out of this . We will have our ups and downs as month moves into month  --  and remind me , will you , fella , we 've got to be clear on the approximate time of arrival  --  but there 's always one thing to remember . "  |p299Dr  . Castlebar paused , drew out his briar pipe and tobacco pouch . " There 's going to be a baby at the end of it , and once you see your baby , well , everything you 've gone through begins to seem like fun . " Willis could not help but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sales approach , and in fact it was one . Dr. Castlebar , in his simple , direct way made both of them want that baby . When he pointed his finger at Willis and looked hard at him , and said , " Now , fella , you wanted this baby , did n't you ? " Willis was able to answer as he should have . " You bet I did , " he said . The doctor leaned forward and slapped him affectionately on the knee . " Well , that 's fine , fella , " Dr. Castlebar said . " Let 's hope this will be the first of many and consider this a trial run , shall we ? The more you have the easier it gets , and now one thing more . " The doctor looked at the bowl of his pipe and then pointed its stem at Sylvia aggressively . " I want a breast-fed , not a bottle baby . " " All right , " Sylvia answered , " anything you say . " And then she began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " This is n't any joke " It was remarkable how expertly he could keep Sylvia from laughing . " Now let 's see , " Dr. Castlebar said . " The date ought to be August fourteenth , and it cuts right into my proposed vacation . " " I 'm sorry about that , " Sylvia said , " but I do n't see how I can help it now . " Dr. Castlebar shook his finger at her . " You ca n't , " he said . " That 's why I 'm against autumn marriages . Next time I want a January baby . " This remark seemed to strike him as highly amusing . " Go ahead , " he said , " laugh . It 's a joke . I told you we were going to have a lot of fun out of this . " Willis believed that no man could possibly forget any detail of the experience of becoming a father for the first time , but even sop300his acutest recollections of parenthood eventually became confused . This may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , in a mild way , as well as on women . Willis could remember a lot of things that happened , around hospitals while he waited during nervous hours for news , but he could no longer decidewhether these events had heralded the appearance of Alfred , who was born in August , 1937 , or Paul , in 1940 , or Louise , right in the middle of the war . It often amused Willis to hear Republicans refer scathingly to the Roosevelt administration as " a government by crisis , " not that he was not a good Republican himself , or that he approved for a minute of the creeping socialism of the New Deal . Life for any married man was one crisis after another , business or domestic . If a nation was merely a conglomeration of homes , as politicians liked to say , how could government possibly avoid crises ? That summer was very hot in Rahway , and a simplification of the Planeroid process was just going into production . When everything at the plant had demanded his constant personal attentionWillis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any moment . Dr. Castlebar had given them a good idea of how the thing would start . First the little fella would have to drop down lower than he was . The fun , as Dr. Castlebar put it , might start unexpectedly after that . It was perfectly simple to tell when the fun was going to start and there was no reason to get into a panic . There would be a series of pains . Never mind one pain , because everybody living could have one pain , even  --  ha , ha  --  a prospective father . Had n't Dr. Castlebar told them they were going to get a little fun out of this ? It was advisable , though not obligatory , to pack a small suitcasewith a bed jacket and comb and brush and things like that , and keep it ready . All Sylvia needed to do was pick up the tele --  phone and tell Miss Grump at Dr. Castlebar 's office what was going on . There was only one other thing to remember . Never forget it 's no disgrace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swellest and most natural and useful thing that a woman could do in the world . Everyone always loved a gal who was having a baby and always wanted to help.  |p301Little  Al was always a good boy , and it was not his fault that he caused any undue trouble coming into the world . That was something you could blame on Dr. Castlebar , although Dr. Castlebar said it was all a part of the fun that he could not be located and arrived at the hospital only two minutes ahead of Al . After all , he got there , did n't he ? Dr. Castlebar actually was correct in most of his predictions . Even if the whole episode , perhaps , had not been as much fun as the doctor said it would be , there were lighter moments . It surely was amazing how time glossed over grimmer ones . Once you looked through the plate-glass window of the hospital 's antiseptic creche at little Al , you were convinced that all was for the best in this best of all possible worlds . Finally there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital and the sight of Al in his own bassinet in the hall bedroom . The world was never the same once you had a baby and once you joined the ranks of parenthood . You were immediately a wiser and a more useful citizen and you had a real stake in the community . It was almost like being gifted with a new language , once you had a baby . There were plenty of things , businesswise , to take up Willis 's attention in those last years of the thirties . There was no doubt  --  with the assistance of a new sales manager and a general shakeup in the office force , plus the new funds loaned the company by Mrs. Jacoby  --  that he was getting Rahway Belt into a real competitive position . Willis had made it his personal task to visit every one of Rahway Belt 's customers , sitting down with them and talking over their production problems . Also he devoted countless hours to the sales force . He respected the accumulated sales wisdom of several of the older salesmen  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man equaled an overenergetic and impulsive younger one , but he also injected new blood . Jack Nelson , for instance , now vice president of Briggs , Bryant , had started with him at Rahway Belt , and Buzz Page , whom he first saw as an office boy out in Toledo , was with him still , and there would be no trouble making the list longer . Yet you always had to remember that a sales force , no matter how effective it might be , was hopeless without a product in whichp302it could believe . It was odd how many people , even in large organizations , were prone to neglect this simple fact . Willis lived , ate , and slept with Planeroid belting . He was only too glad to share his ultimate successes in this regard with Jerry Bascomb , whom he was lucky enough to hire in June ' 37 , just after Jerry graduated from Tech . From the very start Willis insisted on namingJerry 's inventions that improved the Planeroid process the Bascomb patents . This was a good means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him still , and Willis was the godfather of one of Jerry 's lovely children . By the beginning of 1940 , the Planeroid line was better than it had ever been , and sales figures and earnings showed that it was going places in a modest way.  |p303THE  YEAR 1940 , when you came to think of it , was a headache year for nearly everyone in America , and Willis 's personal and private affairs offered no exception . They moved , like nearly everyone else 's , against a background of shock and crisis . To begin with , young Paul arrived that February . Rahway Belt was picking up and they could afford with difficulty a nurse for the children . Willis 's whole budget was thrown out of balance but this was only the domestic side of the picture . Besides an uncertain business situation and restlessness among plant workers , Mr. Jacoby 's health suddenly became so bad that he was obliged to cancel his usual winter trip to Arizona . Willis felt a premonition when he went to call on Mr. Jacoby . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacoby , in spite of his high spirits , was far from well , and Willis 's gloomiest conclusions were confirmedwhen he met Mrs. Jacoby downstairs in the living room . He must have made this call several days after Paul was born , because he remembered apologizing to Mrs. Jacoby for not having come sooner . Willis often thought that everyone 's life consisted of a series of repetitions . He had once been the young confidant of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Harcourt , and now his relationship with the Jacobys was on a larger scale , but there was the same atmosphere of trust and friendship . If Rahway Belt meant little to Mrs. Jacoby , except as something that made her husband happy , Willis knew that she appreciated what he had done by way of putting the investmenton a paying basis . Only a few days before his call , Mr. Henry Peters , who was ap304stockholder in Rahway Belt , had offered Willis some shares of RahwayBelt common . If Willis were to buy this stock , his holdings would be nearer 40 than 30 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should tell Mrs. Jacoby , but he did not do so immediately when he met her downstairs , because he was still shocked by Mr. Jacoby 's appearance . There was never any use mincing matters with Mrs. Jacoby . She looked worried and unhappy , but like the late Seth Wilfred she knew how to cut her losses . " There 's a heart complication , " she said . " Manley wo n't go to the hospital . He has superstitious ideas about hospitals . " " I 'm awfully sorry , " Willis told her . " I did n't know things were as serious as this . " " Well , they are , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " but something serious happens to everyone some time . Sit down , and I 'll ring for Henry to get you something . " " Oh , no thank you , Mrs. Jacoby , " Willis said . " I must n't keep you from anything you 're doing . " " Sit down , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " You 're only keeping me from worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going pretty well , " Willis told her . " I know it is , " Mrs. Jacoby said , " and it 's a great comfort to Manley . He was reminding me only this morning how I had advised him to sell that plant . " Willis smiled , but at the same time he had a qualm of apprehension . If Mr. Jacoby should die , there might be every reason for Mrs. Jacoby to sell out her interest in Rahway Belt . It was time to mention the common stock he had been offered . He did not want for a moment to have Mrs. Jacoby gain the idea that he was trying to get control of Rahway Belt . He wanted to explain his motives very clearly , but Mrs. Jacoby spoke again be-.fore he could start . " Henry Peters says you want to buy his stock , " she said . Although Willis was beginning to pride himself on his ability to handle situations , he found himself pausing clumsily . " Peters offered it to me first , of course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I did n't want any more . Why should I , with Manley the way he is ? " Willis often thought it was a pity that Mrs. Jacoby had not been a man . " I am very glad that Mr. Peters consulted you first about this matter , " Willis said , and he hoped he was not speaking too quickly or eagerly . " I was just going to take up the question with you myself , but seeing Mr. Jacoby so ill made it completely leave my mind . " There was a pause , a very brief one , but it was long enough to make Willis highly uncomfortable . " I 'm sure you were , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " I really was , Mrs. Jacoby , " Willis answered . It was a very silly remark to make , and besides , he had answeredmuch too quickly . " Of course you would really , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " You 're too shrewd to play around behind my back . " " I 'm awfully glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course I realize it , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " There is no need to worry about me , Willis . I do n't want to have control of Rahway Belt "  --  she lowered her voice slightly  --  " if Manley should pass on " The lowering of her voice gave Willis an uncomfortable sensation . It was the duty of anyone in business to discount any unpleasantpossibility , but somehow Mrs. Jacoby made the passing on of Mr. Jacoby an accomplished fact . " Now , Mrs. Jacoby , " Willis said , " it 's probably the winter climate . I 'm sure Mr. Jacoby has many happy years ahead of him . " He was not surprised that Mrs. Jacoby should discount the remark , but he did think that she might have acknowledged it slightly . " All I care about is the earnings , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " Rahway Belt wo n't mean a thing to me except as another holding in the portfolio "  --  shelowered her voice again  --  " if Manley passes on " Willis cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom his future depended . " Would you mind telling me , Mrs. Jacoby , " he said , " if Mr.p306Jacoby should  --  er  --  pass on , are you planning to sell your stock ? " " I wo n't sink any more money in it , " Mrs. Jacoby said . " I 've bailed the company out once but I wo n't again . It 's Manley 's company , you know . " Willis laughed , but he was afraid his laughter was not very convincing . " You wo n't have to bail it out again , Mrs. Jacoby , " he said . He was pleased that Mrs. Jacoby did not pause before she answered . " No , " she said , " you 're doing very well , but let 's stop beating about the bush . I wo n't have any sentimental feeling about RahwayBelt  --  if Manley passes on . " He was always grateful to Mrs. Jacoby for having stated her thoughts so frankly . He could understand that Mrs. Jacoby was actually saying that the end of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for his own interests  --  if Manley Jacoby should pass on . He was certain that he never would have thought of writing Mr. Bryson Harcourt  --  that he would only have thought in the vaguest way about combining the Klaus patents with the Planeroid patents  --  if Mrs. Jacoby had not said that she would no longer have a sentimental interest in Rahway Belt in the event of Mr. Jacoby 's demise . It was a relief to meet someone like Mrs. Jacoby , who did not have the Harcourts ' sentiments , because anyone with common sense knew that sentiment had no place in industrial transactions . As soon as he left the Jacoby house on the ridge , Willis went at once to see Sylvia at the hospital . She was sitting up in her new bed jacket , and there were several new vases of flowers in the room , besides new offerings of booties and knitted blankets , all with a blue motif for a boy . IIe made a careful note of all the cards so that he might acknowledge them without bothering Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia asked . " I 'm afraid he 's not very well , honey , " Willis said . " There 's the usual arthritis , but it is also complicated by a heart condition , but do n't worry about it , honey . "  | " Oh , dear , " Sylvia said . " I 'm just beginning to get to like Mr. Jacoby . " He did not want Sylvia to be worried , especially now that she was giving little Paul several ounces more milk than she had managed for little Al . " What is going to happen if he dies ? " Sylvia asked . It was obviously not the time to tell Sylvia about his conversation with Mrs. Jacoby . " Honey , " he said , " you let me worry about that one . " It was fortunate that Willis started that same evening to give serious thought to the possible merger of Rahway Belt and HarcourtMill , because Mr. Jacoby died two weeks later , just when he was rallying and when preparations were going ahead for the Jacobys ' annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . The truth was that the time was ripe for a change and everythingfitted together in a more perfect manner than any other proposedmerger that Willis had ever explored . Usually there were many unexpected obstacles , but not with Iarcourt and Rahway Belt . There was no duplication in their products , because Planeroidfilled a need completely different from the more ambitiousHartex line . In fact the two plants complemented each other , and the only possible objection to a merger was distance . Two days after Mr. Jacoby 's funeral , Willis decided to get in touch with Mr. Bryson Harcourt , without consulting Mrs. Jacoby , because obviously no one would be committed by an exploratory conversation . In order to avoid office gossip he wrote the letter himself , using his portable typewriter , on a card table in his living room in Orange . Little Paul and Sylvia had only recently arrived from the hospital with Miss Farquahr , a trained nurse who was giving Sylvia a sort of refresher course in baby-tending . Margaret , the new general maid , who had come after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no good reason except to prove the axiom that trained nurses and other household employees never could get on together . Sylvia was still not al/lowed downstairs , and little Al was quite a problem , since he had reached the stage of pulling breakable objects off tables and then of pulling the tables and chairs on top of himself . Just when Willis was preparing to sit down quietly before supper , Sylvia had called to him from upstairs that he would simply have to look after little Al until his bedtime . Miss Farquahr was busy changing little Paul , and Margaret was busy with supper . Dear Mr. Harcourt , I am Willis Wayde , whom I hope you will remember from the old days at the Harcourt Mill . Although it has been a long time since we have met , I have a warm spot in my heart for Harcourt , and any news I hear from the mill is still to me like news from home in a very real sense . . . . There was a crash and a scream from little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Al had contrived to pull over the silvercigarette box which the Bryson Harcourts had sent as a wedding present . The corner of the box had hit Al on the forehead , and now the floor was strewn with cigarettes . " All right , Al , " Willis said . " Daddy does n't want Al to touch . No , no . " It was necessary in those days to speak to Al in simple monosyllables , and even so Al usually went right on with what he was doing . It took quite a while to gather up the cigarettes , and Al roared when the silver box was taken away from his clutches . He did not want the small horse which Willis gave him in place of it , and so thoughtlessly Willis let Al have his fountain pen . In the quiet that ensued Willis returned to his typewriter . Knowing how busy you must be , I shall state my reason for this letter briefly . I find myself here in general charge of the RahwayBelting Company , and I believe I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al had completely dismantled the fountain pen and that ink had cascaded over his knitted suit and down to the rug . He immediately took the pen away from little Al , who began to weep again , and then he called first for Miss Farquahrp309and then for Margaret , but no one answered . Then as long as the damage had been done he turned back to the typewriter. . . . which I think may interest you as much as it does me . I would prefer to tell you the details verbally and so I ask whether I may call on you at your convenience and by appointment . . . . There was another crash by the fireplace . Little Al had pulled over the fire tongs and shovel , and this time he appeared to be severely injured , but Willis decided to finish the letter because fortunately little Al 's screams of pain were changing to a shriller and more familiar note of indignant fury . As Willis endeavored to concentrate , it occurred to him that life was one long journey past milestones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction , it was better , perhaps , to scream openly and shamelessly like little Al . It so happens that I must make a few calls in Boston next week . You may not have heard , by the way , that the Walton people up there are ordering our new Planeroid conveyors , and this is keepingus pretty busy in Rahway . Willis looked up again from his typewriter . Miss Farquahr had arrived . She stood impersonally in front of the card table in her starched white uniform . " What have you done to little Alfred , Mr. Wayde ? " she asked . " I did n't do anything , " Willis said . " He does things to himself . Would you please mind taking him upstairs ? " " His crying upset Mrs. Wayde , " Miss Farquahr said . " Miss Farquahr , " Willis said , and he smiled in an engaging way that usually worked with secretaries and office employees , " I do n't seem to be very good at child rearing and I am trying to write a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Alfred for a minute , Miss Farquahr ? " After all , he was paying Miss Farquahr a substantial weekly wage , and it seemed to him that whenever she was wanted Miss Farquahr was indulging in necessary rest periods . " I have n't a minute now , Mr. Wayde , " Miss Farquahr told him . " I think Alfred would be quiet if you were to read to him . He 's in/terested in Peter Rabbit . Mrs. Wayde read it through to him five times yesterday and he sat on the bed as quiet as a little mousey . " " All right , " Willis said . " If you get it , I 'll read it to him . " If he had a minute or two longer he might be able to conclude his letter to Mr. Bryson Harcourt . " Peter Rabbit is right on the easy chair by the fireplace , " Miss Farquahr said . " Alfred sees it now . Alfred , give Peter Rabbit to Daddy , and Daddy read to Alfred . " Then Miss Farquahr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . " Alfred , " Willis said , " sit down and look at the pretty pictures . Sit down and be quiet , Alfred . " Alfred seemingly respected the change in his father 's voice . He sat down quietly on the living-room rug . Of course , it was not a quiet that would last , but it gave Willis an opportunity to collecthis thoughts . It was not literally true that he had to go up to Boston to make a few calls , but the statement sounded well . If you will write me  --  or better , send me a wire  --  I can arrange my schedule to fit yours . It will be a genuine pleasure to see you again and to talk over old times . I hope that Mrs. Harcourt and Bill and Bess are all well and that you are enjoying a good winter . Sincerely , as always , Little Al was becoming restive again . " Here , Al , " Willis told him , " sit down on Daddy 's knee . Once upon a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Flopsy , Mopsy , Cotton-tail , and Peter . They lived ... ' Although Willis tried to put suspense and conviction into his reading , Alfred would not stay still . He dropped Alfred hastily to the floor and looked down at his carefully pressed trousers . " Miss Farquahrl " he shouted . " Would you mind coming down here ? Quickly , please , Miss Farquahr . " Thinking it over later , Willis could see that there were a number of things wrong about his letter . If he had done it in the office after hours he could have given his whole mind to the composition . The unevenness and the strike-overs must have shown Mr.p311Harcourt that it was a home-written effort , and of course it was hastily phrased , but it never occurred to Willis for a moment that Mr. Bryson Harcourt would have thought the letter was merely an application for a job . He was shocked when he found a night letter on his desk at Rahway three days later . " Roger and I delighted if you can return to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house , Beacon Street , five-thirty Tuesday , and please stay to dinner . " There was an overcordiality in the telegram that indicated BrysonHarcourt 's transparency . Old H.H. would never have sent such a telegram , but it was clear that Willis was still favorably rememberedback at the Harcourt Mill . There was also an indication that things were not going well , since they were overanxious to have him back . " Delighted to meet you five-thirty Tuesday , " he wired . " Sorry gave impression seeking position because am happy here . " He wanted to make it plain from the start that he expected no favors . In the last analysis he was presenting a simple business proposition which even Bryson Harcourt would readily understand . Boston had been off the track for Willis Wayde for many years , except for fleeting visits with Sylvia to Craigie Street in Cambridge . He had only been back to the city once , busincsswise , since he had left the Harcourt Mill , and that was for Beakney-Graham . He had gone on this occasion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " presentation team . " The presentation team had occupied cramped quarters in the Hotel Statler , while Mr. Beakneyhad resided in a comfortable suite at the Ritz-Carlton overlooking the Public Garden . If you were out after a big account , Mr. Beakney would say , a little extra expense money was very often a mighty fine investment . By this he did not mean ostentation , Mr. Beakney used to say , but quiet dignity without a trace of brashness . A welltailored , unobtrusive suit of clothes , Mr. Beakney used to say , plus the right tie and a well-shined pair of shoes , plus an expensive but worn suitcase , and a fountain pen that wrote at the right time  --  all these minor factors were better than an hour of sales pres/entation . Appearance and confidence meant as much as words , Mr. Beakney used to say , and a sound hotel address would back up all those other details . It was advisable never to forget that someone from your client 's office might drop into your room with a message or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted everyone who traveled for Beakney-Graham to have a photograph on his bureau of his mother , or of his wife and children . The thought that a man cared about his home had a fine effect on anyone who might drop in . Seriously , as Mr. Beakney used to say , you might as well face it  --  America was a woman 's world . For instance , was n't 8o per cent of the national income controlled by women ? You had better love your mother if you worked for Beakney-Graham.  |p313WILLIS  HAD spent many hours planning his approach to Mr. Bryson Harcourt . He knew it was better to show indifference than eagerness . Without undue familiarity he wished to show that he had a warm and loyal spot in his heart for the Harcourt Mill and the memory of Mr. Henry Harcourt . IIe wished to show that he was calling on Mr. Bryson Harcourt as one who still appreciated the many kindnesses the family had shown him , but he also wanted to have Mr. Bryson Harcourt realize that he was a successfulindividual in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz-Carlton in Boston . He took the **26;8618;TOOLONG train so that he would arrive at the hotel in time to spruce up before he went to see Mr. Harcourt on Beacon Street . He had applied saddle soap himself to the smaller of the two suitcases that he had purchased for his honeymoon . The unobtrusive briefcase he carried was more of a leather envelope for a few documents than a salesman 's bag , but even so Willis decided to leave it at the hotel . He wore a dark overcoat , which he had purchased two weeks before , and a darkish herringbonesuit  --  double-breasted  --  made for him by the same tailor patronizedby Mr. Beakney . Little Paul had been five months on the way when Willis had decided to buy tailor-made clothes rather than ready-made suits . It seemed extravagant at such a time , what with all the doctor 's bills and hospital bills , but still , as Willis pointed out to Sylvia , a good tailor-made suit would outlast a readymadeone two to one . There was no need for him to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thoughtp314of the time when he had reserved a table for Bess Harcourt and himself  --  it was amazing to think how many years ago . He also recollectedhe had promised Sylvia to call up Mr. and Mrs. Hodges in Cambridge , but he decided not to do so until he was finished with the Harcourt matter . Sylvia and everything in Orange seemed very far away . " Front , " the hotel clerk called , and he handed Willis 's room key to the bellboy . " The room overlooks the Public Garden , as you suggested , Mr. Wayde . Can you tell us how long you will be with us ? " " Tonight , " Willis said , and he smiled . " And tomorrow night , I hope . I always enjoy it here in Boston . " When he was alone in his double room , Willis opened his suitcaseimmediately and hung up his extra suit and put his traveling photographs on the writing table . The photograph of his mother had been with him ever since the Harvard Business School . Beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ChieftainManor , and a baby picture of little Al . It was still only half past four o'clock by the time Willis had shaved and changed his shirt , and so he had time to sit for a while looking out at the Public Garden . There was no doubt that the days were getting longer . The waning light on the Public Garden reminded him of the light on the snow at the Harcourt place , and somehow the afternoon shadows and the sky itself had a quality that was different from New Jersey  --  a harsher , plainer quality . Willis discovered that Beacon Street and the Bryson Harcourts ' house only aroused distinct memories without awakening the keen emotion that they had once evoked . He remembered the night he had first walked up the steps with Bess , and he remembered the time when he had asked Bess to dinner and the theater  --  when Bess had stood him up for Edward Ewing . Thinking of the whole episode made Willis feel like a modern traveler regarding a classical ruin . The maid who answered the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised that she remembered him much more clearly than he did her . " I 'll take your coat , Mr. Willis , " the maid said.  | " Oh , thank you , " Willis said . " I hope Mr. Harcourt is expecting me . He glanced unobtrusively at his wrist watch as he spoke . It was two minutes after five-thirty . " Oh yes , " the maid said , " Mr. and Mrs. Harcourt are expecting you upstairs , Mr. Willis . " Although it had been nearly ten years since Willis had seen them , Mr. Bryson and Mrs. Harcourt still had the durable outdoor quality that he remembered . There were gray streaks in Mr. Bryson'sdark hair , but he still had a young look . There had always been a warmth and kindness about Mr. Bryson and this quality had not gone . There was a moment , as Willis stood in the doorway of the upstairs parlor , when he realized that the balance between them all had changed . He knew before either of the Harcourts spoke that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had something that they wanted . " Why , Willis , " Mrs. Harcourt said , " how well you look ! " " And you too , Mrs. Harcourt , " Willis said . She had the florid complexionhe remembered , but her hair was growing becomingly white . " It is a genuine pleasure to see you again . " " I told Bryson that I wanted to have a glimpse of you and then I 'd go , " Mrs. Harcourt said . " How are your father and mother  --  well , I hope ? " " Oh , yes thanks , " Willis said . " They 're on the West Coast , you know . " " You 're staying to dinner , are n't you ? " Mrs. Harcourt asked . " If it would not be an inconvenience , it would be a great pleasure , Mrs. Harcourt , " Willis said . " That 's splendid , " Mrs. Harcourt said . " I 've asked Bess and Edwardover . She 's terribly anxious to see you . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you do n't know that Bess married Edward Ewing . I do n't remember whether you were with us or not when they got engaged . " " Oh yes , I was , as a matter of fact , " Willis said . " It will be a great pleasure to see them both again . " " Why do n't you take Willis across the hall , dear , " Mrs. Harcourtp316said , " for your little talk , but do n't be too long because we all want to hear about him . " " It is just like old times having you here , Willis , " Mr. Harcourt said , and he took Willis by the arm and led him past the stairs into the smaller sitting room that looked out on Beacon Street , and closed the sliding door . " Will you have a cigar , Willis ? " " No thank you , sir , " Willis said , and he laughed . " Mr. Harcourt taught me a lot of things , but he never could get me to like cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mind , " Mr. Bryson said . " Father taught me the cigar habit earlier than he expected . I used to steal cigars out of the humidor in the big house when I was thirteen , and I do n't think he ever knew . You 're looking very fit , Willis . " " I always make it a point , " Willis said , " to do a little bending and stretching and a few push-ups every day , but sometimes I think I thrive on hard work . " " Let 's see , " Mr. Bryson said . " What is the name of that place where you are working ? " A feeling of frustration , which Willis had forgotten , returned to him when Mr. Bryson asked that question . " It is the Rahway Belting Company , sir , " Willis said , and he tried not to speak too slowly . " You may have heard of the Planeroid conveyors that we manufacture . They fill a different need from Hartex . Incidentally , the Walton people are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " Mr. Harcourt said , " Rahway Belt . " Willis settled himself more comfortably in his chair . " Of course , it is a small company , " Willis said . " I happen to be the head of it at the moment . " He tried to speak as casually as possible , and he smiled . " That 's why I came up to see you , sir . " Willis 's instinct was telling him that the amenities of the interviewwere over . Mr. Bryson nodded as he always did when he was trying to put facts together . " Dear me , " he said , " I had no idea that you were so responsible there . I 'm sorry , selfishly , because you see , we are looking for a new plant manager at Harcourt . I thought of you in that connectionjust as soon as I got your letter . " Mr. Harcourt paused and Willis smiled sympathetically.  | " Of course , " Mr. Harcourt said , " Father was under the impression that you would move ahead quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of your own organization . " Willis laughed in a deprecating way . " It really is n't my own organization , sir , " Willis said . " I 'm acting as president only for the moment . I 'm sorry you have to look for a new plant manager , because I know they are rather hard to find . " Mr. Bryson shook his head . " It is n't finding them  --  it is keeping them , " he said . " You may remember my cousin Roger , do n't you ? " " Oh yes , " Willis said , " I remember Mr. Roger Harcourt very well . " Mr. Bryson puffed for a moment on his cigar . " Of course , " he said , " I keep forgetting . Of course you know Roger Harcourt as well as I do . He has a disagreeable streak , but I frankly do n't know what I 'd do without him . " Willis nodded understandingly but he did not answer . It was far better to let Mr. Bryson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bryson said , " when I told him I had heard from you . " " I am very pleased that Mr. Roger reacted that way , " Willis said . " Of course I will always have a warm spot in my heart for the Harcourt Mill . " " There is such a thing as sentiment even in business , is n't there ? " Mr. Bryson said . " It is like old times talking to you , Willis . I had half forgotten what good friends we used to be , and how you used to come over to see Bill and Bess . " " It will be a great pleasure to see Bess this evening , " Willis said , " and I hope that Bill is well . " " Bill . " Mr. Bryson laughed exactly as he had long ago when Bill 's name was mentioned . " He 's down in Bermuda now . Ever since he married Anne Gresham they stay at her family 's place there for most of the winter . I keep trying to talk mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's see , Willis , how old are you ? " " I 'll be thirty-four in November , sir , " Willis said . " Just Bill 's age . I should have remembered . " Mr. Brysonp318laughed again . " It must be great to mention your age at your next birthday so happily . " Willis felt uneasy for the first time since they had been talking . He did not realize that he had been so transparent . " Well , it is surprising how time marches on , " Mr. Bryson said , and you 're married too . I remember now  --  to a girl Bill used toknow in Cambridge , the daughter of a professor at Harvard . " " Yes , sir , " Willis answered , " Sylvia Hodges . " " Well , " Mr. Bryson said again , " time certainly marches on , but there is one thing that puzzles me . " " What 's that , sir ? " Willis asked . " You know , " Mr. Bryson said , " Father always used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking business . He used to say to let the situation develop without forcing it , but I ca n't help being curious . If you do n't want a job , why have you come up here to see me , Willis ? " Willis waited for a moment , deliberately , because he wanted to be sure of Mr. Bryson 's full attention , and the time had come to put things into very simple terms . " Well , " Willis said , and he tried to speak slowly , " I do n't want to startle you , sir , and maybe this whole thing should have something more of an introduction . " He checked himself and sat up straighter . " I was wondering if you would be interested in buyingthe Rahway Belting Company , Mr. Harcourt . " It was the most decisive thing that he had ever said . The words were out in the room and all his imaginary talks with Mr. Bryson were swept away . " Good God ! " Mr. Bryson said . " Just a minute , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without thinking of it , Mr. IIarcourt . You see , there would be no cash involved , only a negotiated exchange of stock . You could call the whole thing IIarcourt Associates , if you wanted , and if you want , you can get me with the deal . I do n't see why I could n't manage both the Rahway plant and the Harcourt Mill . " Mr. Bryson sighed . " I wish Roger were here , " he said , " but as long as he is n't , you had better begin at the beginning , Willis . "  |p319Past  associations were so strong , as Willis gave his explanations , that it was hard to remember that he was no longer Mr. Henry Harcourt 's assistant engaged in explaining , at Mr. Harcourt 's request , another business detail to Mr. Bryson . " Frankly , Willis , " Mr. Bryson said , " I 'm looking for fewer and not more complications and I do n't exactly see how any sort of combination could possibly simplify any of our problems . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and it was not hard for him to present his ideas , because he had rehearsed them so often  --  " that things will be much simpler and that you will have much less personal responsibility . Do you remember what Benjamin Franklinsaid  --  at least I think it was Franklin , check me if I 'm wrong  --  when the Declaration of Independence was being signed ? " Mr. Bryson frowned and shook his head . " Let 's see , " he said  --  " the Declaration of Independence ? No , I do n't seem to remember at the moment . " " Well , I do n't know if I 've got it straight myself , " Willis said . It was not a time to appear too bright , and his age was a handicap in talking with Mr. Bryson . " I think Benjamin Franklin said that if we do n't hang together we will hang separately . " " That 's right , " Mr. Bryson said , " but I do n't see what it has to do with the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time it was effective , and there was a grim menace in that statement about hanging separately . " Please do n't think , " Willis said , and he laughed heartily , " that I am offering any threat to the Harcourt Mill . It is larger and stronger , of course , than the little show I 'm running . I am only stating a business axiom , Mr. Harcourt , in rather theatric terms  --  only saying that if two businesses combine they are much stronger in the face of competition . Small businesses do n't have the chance they had a few years ago . " " I know , " Mr. Bryson said . " That 's what Roger is always saying  --  we 're losing money and we ought to sell out . He has n't any sense of responsibility . " Willis nodded and watched Mr. Bryson gravely . " Mr. Harcourt , " he said , " what I 'm about to say comes from thep320bottom of my heart . I think I know the belting business . I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stopped , and when he went on the conviction of his own voice impressed him . " I 'll guarantee that none of us will lose money if we can get together , and if Mr. Henry Harcourt were here he would be the first to agree with me . " Willis had been a good salesman even before his final training at Beakney-Graham . There was no trouble , he always said , in selling anything to anyone , whether it was an article or an idea , provided you believed in the thing you wished to sell  --  but belief should be harnessed with knowledge . Willis had never believed in anything as fully as he had in joining the Harcourt Mill with Rahway Belt . He had his facts so clearly that eloquence was not necessary . All he needed was patience . One always had to be patient with Mr. Bryson . Willis went over the facts very slowly and he asked for a pencil and paper so that he could set down figures . If you thought of selling as a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Willis could turn his mind , if he wanted to reminisce , to some of his outstanding achievements in salesmanship which were as tangible to him as a big-game hunter'strophies , but nothing had ever been as perfect as the HarcourtRahwayBelt promotion . It had not been difficult in detail , because Mr. Bryson had been with him all the way . The beauty of the whole thing lay in what you might call the rapport , to use a French word . Right from the beginning , he and Mr. Harcourt were in tune and in step . Mr. Bryson was confused and weary of the details of the Harcourt Mill . He had never wanted to be the head of it , and he had assumed the leadership only as a family duty . The beauty of the Rahway-Harcourt promotionwas that Willis and Mr. Bryson desired two different things which fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle . Willis wanted a chance to move forward , while Mr. Bryson wanted to move back . It was a very pretty problem of balance . It was beautiful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think you have something , Willis , " Mr. Bryson said.  | " Of course I 'm not much of a judge of these things , but the furtherwe go into this the better it seems to look . " The time had come to draw back slightly . Willis paused for a moment seemingly lost in thought . His hesitation was a little like Tom Sawyer 's reluctance to allow the other boys to paint the fence , and it also resembled Antony 's feigned alarm when he had aroused the Roman mob . " I agree with you , Mr. Harcourt , " he said , " but I think we both ought to remember that there may be some sort of catch in this thing that neither of us sees , and fortunately we both have plenty of time to think it over . " " I 'm glad we have time , " Mr. Bryson said , " because I can see that this is pretty complicated . It does take thinking over . " " It certainly does , " Willis said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get someone else 's reaction . I may as well tell you frankly that I have n't discussed this with any of our people at Rahway  --  in fact , not even with my wife . " Willis laughed . He had thought of everything and now was the time for a lighter , friendlier touch . " Of course Sylvia is n't in a position to be interested right now . She 's just back from the hospital with our second child . " It always paid to bring family into such discussions . If any proof of stability was needed , there it was , with Sylvia just back from the hospital . " Really ? " Mr. Bryson said . " Is it a boy or a girl ? " " A boy , " Willis said . " He 's actually our second boy . The first one 's Al , named after my father . Al 's quite a little rascal  --  always pulling things off tables and things like that . But , honestly , I did n't mean to bring the little fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he immediately became serious . " I 'm sorry I digressed , because the beauty of our situation lies in the fact that we are both thinking out loud and that neither of us is committed to anything whatsoever . In fact , it may very well be that our majority stockholder , Mrs. Jacoby , may be entirely against the whole transaction . " " Let 's see , " Mr. Bryson said , " who is Mrs. Jacoby ? " " The widow of the late president of Rahway Belt , " Willis told him . " Mrs. Jacoby has an excellent head for business . She is thep322daughter of the financier Seth Wilfred . I do n't know whether you have ever heard of him . " " Oh , " Mr. Bryson said , " was he the Wilfred that was mixed up with the Erie Railroad ? " Willis nodded . The mention of Mr. Seth Wilfred , he could see , gave Rahway Belt a new stability and a brighter background , but a disturbed look had come over Mr. Bryson . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs.  --  er  --  Jacoby , " Mr. Bryson said . " It would seem to me that she is a key figure in your picture . " Willis nodded in grave agreement and at the same time like a younger man acknowledging an older man 's rebuke . " I suppose I should have , " Willis said , " before I came up here to bother you about something which is so theoretical , but the truth is I was hoping I might get a little something more concrete to give Mrs. Jacoby when I finally did see her . " Willis shook his head slowly . " Frankly there has been no opportunity to take up any matter with her because of Mr. Jacoby 's illness and death . His funeral was only a very short time ago . " For a few seconds they both were gravely silent . The mention of death was often useful in pulling together the loose ends of a business conversation . " I wish I had some way of predicting , " Willis said . " I hope Mrs. Jacoby will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp sense of elation as he glanced at Mr. Bryson Harcourt . There was no doubt of Mr. Bryson 's concern now that he saw bright prospects moving away from him . " I certainly hope she will , " Mr. Bryson said , " and I do n't see why she should n't . Suppose we go on the assumption she agrees . " " I think that is a very good idea , Mr. Harcourt , " Willis answered , " as long as we are just thinking out loud . " " Good heavens ! " Mr. Bryson said . " I have n't been so absorbed for a long while . It is a quarter of seven o'clock and I hear voices . It must be Bess and Edward . You 'll stay over tomorrow , wo n't you ? I 'd like to have you talk to Roger . " " It would be a great pleasure , Mr. Harcourt , " Willis said , " asp323long as it is definitely understood that we are just thinking out loud . " Willis was beginning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harcourt pulled open the sliding door , Willis could see that Mrs. Harcourt and Bess and Edward Ewing had already gathered around a tray of cocktails in the sitting room across the hall . Mrs. Harcourt had changed into a black velvetevening gown , and Bess was dressed in green . A green dress , as Willis had told her once , went particularly well with her greenish-blueeyes . Her hair , Willis could see in those seconds while he walked across the hall to the parlor , was still yellow but , like his own , darker . She looked taller than he remembered ; and he could tell  --  because a man could always tell such things  --  that Bess Ewing had made a special effort for him . The gloss of her hair and its somewhat aggressive curly quality told very plainly that Bess had been to the beauty parlor that morning . It was pleasant of course , particularly under present circumstances , to realize that Bess wanted to look well on his account , but Willis was sure that his interest was now based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bess , his knowledge of young women had been confined only to her , to the few girls he had known at the Clyde High School , or had met in classes at Boston University , and to one or two of Bess 's friends , who had seldom bothered to converse with him . It was very different now . Mrs. Harcourt and Bess , in her green satin and pearls , had a slightly provincial look . Sylvia , even in an old dress , would have attracted more attention than Bess Ewing . The truth was that Sylvia had lived in a real world , while Bess  --  and Edward Ewing too  --  had only existed undera permanent umbrella of financial protection . Bess 's voice had a high note which Willis had always associated with her when she was pleased and elated . " Why , Willis , " she said , and she held out both her hands . " You do n't look a bit different . " He thought that her hands held his a moment longer than was necessary before they dropped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better , " Willis said . " This is a very great pleasure , Bess . "  | " Well , you sound just the same , " Bess said . " You always did sound like Emily Post . " Willis felt his cheeks reddening . " And Uriah Heep , " Willis said , and he laughed louder than was necessary . " Do n't forget Uriah Heep . " Suddenly Bess 's lips lost their malicious smile . " That is n't accurate now , " she said . " You do n't look humble any more . " " Uriah Heep stopped being humble too , " Willis said , and he laughed again  --  " that is , if I remember Dickens . " " Oh , Willis , " Bess said , " let 's stop . I 'm really dreadfully glad to see you . " Then she must have remembered that Willis had not yet said a word to Edward Ewing . Edward was standing waiting , wearing a dinner coat , which made Willis wish that he had brought his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember Edward , do n't you ? " It seemed to Willis that they shook hands in very much the same way they had across the tennis net at the Harcourt place , but Willis was also aware of certain shades of difference . He felt no wishful envy of Edward Ewing now . He felt not only a mental but a physical superiority , because Edward had accumulated a corpulence about his face and waistline , clearly indicating that he did not put saccharine in his coffee , sprinkle wheat germ in his orange juice , or do bending-and-stretching exercises and push-ups in the morning . His brownish eyes had a dull , contented look , giving an impression , which Willis was beginning to recognize , of someone who had never moved forward , in a career or business sense . " I certainly do remember , " Willis said . " I 'm awfully glad to see you again , Willis , " Edward said . " How 's everything going ? " " Fine , " Willis said . " Fine . I 'm living in Orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward ? " " We have four , " Edward said . " That is , the last time I counted up . Four 's right , is n't it , Bess ? " " Right , " Bess said . " And no more in sight on the immediate ho/rizon . But then , Edward and I had a head start over you and  --  oh , dear , I have forgotten your wife 's name , Willis . " Willis laughed heartily and hoped that he did not sound nervous . " Her name is Sylvia , " he said . " You can remember it by the quotation Who is Sylvia ? What is she ? '  --  from Shakespeare , if I 'm not mistaken . " " My God ! " Bess said . " Since when did you take up Shake-speare ? " " I would n't say I have taken him up , " Willis said , " but I like to relax with a book now and then when little Al is n't pulling potted plants off the window sill on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was Mr. Bryson Harcourt interrupting . " Indeed he is , " Willis said , " considering his age . " " Well , boys will be boys , " Mr. Bryson said . " See here , has n't anyone given you a drink ? " " Edward , " Bess said , and Willis remembered her executive tone of voice , " you 're keeping bar for rather , are n't you ? " " Sorry , dear , " Edward said . " My mind was on little Al and the flower pots . Dabney used to do it . You remember , in the con-servatory . " " Never mind Dabney , Edward , " Bess said . " Go and please get Willis his cocktail . What else do you relax with besides Shakespeare , Willis ? " " I always try to relax with something worthwhile , " Willis answered . " What do you consider better ? " Bess asked . " A blonde or a bru-nette ? " Willis laughed heartily . " Gentlemen prefer blondes , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still it was not such a bad remark as a comeback after the one Bess had handed him , and it seemed to please Bess very much . " Do you still like blondes ? " she asked . " Oh yes , " he said , but he did not like Bess Ewing in that wayp326any longer , and he was sure that pique or resentment did not enter into his feeling . " What was it we were talking about before Father interrupted us ? " Bess asked . " Oh , I remember . About good books . What do you read besides Shakespeare ? " " Well , I do n't get a chance to tackle anything much except business reading , " Willis said , " but I am making my way through Dr. Eliot 's  --  I mean President Eliot 's  --  Five-Foot Shelf . I 'm almost through volume ten right now . " " Oh , dear , " Bess said , " not the Five-Foot Shelf of Books . " And then she began to laugh . Willis was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but before he could answer , Bess had stopped laughing . " I was only laughing at one side of you , " she said . " You used to be so persistent that you frightened me sometimes , and you still do , Willis . " " Oh , come , Bess , I am a very mediocre person , and you know it , " he answered , and then Mr. Bryson interrupted them again . " I do n't know what you two are talking about , " he said , " but it 's time to go down to dinner , and before we go  --  " and he spoke in a louder tone  --  " as long as we are all in the family here , I have a word to say that may interest us all . Willis and I have been having a very interesting and worthwhile talk . It may very well be that we will have Willis with us again , at least for part of his time , at the mill . " Mr. Harcourt raised his glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better have another before we go downstairs . " " Oh , no thank you , sir , " Willis said . It was not what he would have called a two-drink night , and he needed to watch everything . He was surprised that Bess looked as though she had just received an answer to an outlandish wish . " Oh , Willis , " she said , " I 'm so glad . " Willis had been in the Bryson Harcourts ' Boston dining room on several occasions years ago , but he saw it with a new eye while he told Mrs. Harcourt about Sylvia and the children . It looked more worn than he remembered , but he had to admit that thep327added dinginess only indicated that the Harcourts were not obliged to care how things looked . He and Sylvia , he was thinking , would have been criticized , but not the Harcourts , and , besides , the room was durably handsome . The pedestal table , without an extra leaf since it was only set for five , was late-eighteenthor early-nineteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather heavy for Willis 's taste . The plates were simple blue Canton  --  traditional New England , of course  --  but they really made quite a show since , what with the Japanese invasion of China and then the European war , no Canton china had been available for years . The heavy pretentious flat silver dated from the middle eighties but the candlesticks and a very handsome epergne , he believed , were Georgian . There was a long gilt-framed mirror behind the sideboard , and on the wall opposite Willis was a portrait which he recognized at once , from the neckconstrictingcostume of the eighteen-twenties , as that of Mr. WilliamHarcourt . It must have been a copy , like the one in the president 's office at the mill , because they surely would not have removed the original from the big house . " What a very beautiful epergne , Mrs. Harcourt , " Willis said . Sylvia had said that he was never good with French words , but he was sure that he had pronounced it correctly . " Why , Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you were interested in old silver . " There was wine , which must have been a claret  --  red wine with red meat . Willis took a sip of it before he answered and made a mental note that he must read up on wines . " Well , frankly , " Willis said , " it was Mr. Henry Harcourt who obliged me to take an interest in antiques . You see , one summer he had me make an inventory of all the antique furniture in the office at the mill . " Willis smiled and shook his head as though he faced a rather hopeless situation . " Now antiques have become a hobby with me , and a recreation which Sylvia and I can share . It 's sort of fun to hop in the car on Saturdays and go around to antique shops . And I 've found that antiquing is a hobby that pays in other ways . "  |p328He  paused and glanced around the table , and finally he encounteredthe stern gaze of the portrait on the opposite wall , and felt pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been obliged to work for Mr. William Harcourt . Bess , who was sitting on his right , had stopped conversing with her father . " How do you mean , antiquing pays in other ways ? " she asked . Willis had not meant to deliver a public dissertation , and as usual Bess had caught him off guard . " Why , " Willis said , " I only meant it never hurts to have an interestthat you can talk about intelligently . Frankly , it interests me that the heads of a great many large businesses seem to collectantiques . They 're apt to appreciate someone who knows about them . " " Is that why you mentioned the epergne ? " Bess asked . Willis felt his face redden . He wished that he could outgrow this telltale habit . " No , " he said , " it was only that I happened to like it . Is n't it here to be admired ? " " Oh , " Bess said , " well , come around and see some of my epergnes sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , but everyone began to laugh . " I certainly will , " Willis said , laughing with the rest , " now you ask me . " Then Willis had an unexpected shock . Bess 's knee was touching his beneath the table . The dessert was floating island , not a favoriteof his . He could not very well draw his knee away , considering the status of the Harcourt-Rahway deal . " Do n't you like your floating island ? " Bess said . " Why , yes , " Willis said , " very much , Bess . " " It always makes me feel young and childish , " Bess said . " It always makes me think of home and the children , " Willis answered . It might have been difficult to have made Sylvia understand that he could not very well withdraw his knee , considering the Harcourt-Rahway situation.  | " Willis , " Mr. Bryson said , " what do you think of this phony war ' in Europe ? Do you think they are waiting until spring ? " Frankly Willis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sylvia did . He did not know much about Hitler or Nazism , and he was bored by arguments on the subject . " Well , " he said , " of course I do n't know anything except what I read in the papers and hear over the air , but I do n't see how they can all sit around doing nothing indefinitely . Someone must be getting ready to do something . " " That same thought has been running through my own mind , " Mr. Harcourt said . " I ca n't help wondering what that something 's going to be . " It was difficult to consider the world situation with Bess 's knee pressed against his . Government interference in business was enough , without having to think about war . " Hitler has n't got the resources , " Edward said . " His whole machine is stopped and the French will put on an offensive this spring . It will all be over before we get a chance to get into it . " At fu-st Willis thought that Edward Ewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting into it , but Willis was learning that war and politics got people unnecessarily stirred up , and so he tried to speak as lightly as possible . " As far as I can see , " Willis said  --  " and I base my knowledge on market letters , especially the Kiplinger Letter from Washing-ton  --  " " What on earth is the Kiplinger Letter ? " Bess asked . Willis felt somewhat constrained explaining Kiplinger , because he suspected that she knew all about it , although she was looking at him brightly . " Well , the Kiplinger Letter , " Willis said , " is edited in Washingtonby a man named Mr. Kiplinger . " " You said all that the first time , " Bess said . " When you mentioned the Kiplinger Washington Letter , of course I knew that it was written by a man in Washington by the name of Mr. Kip-linger . " " Well , I suppose you 're right , " Willis said , and he joined in the laugh at his expense . " But this Mr. Kiplinger does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he naturally ca n't quote . " " I should like to see one of those letters , " Bess said . " Make a note of it , will you , Willis ? " " Indeed I will , Bess , " Willis said , and he took out his pocket notebook and his pencil . " Oh , Willis , " Bess said . " I only meant a mental note . " Willis wanted to answer Bess sharply , but he could n't , what with the Harcourt and Rahway deal . He was relieved when Mrs. Harcourt pushed back her chair . " Come on , Bess , " Mrs. Harcourt said . " You and I can talk about Dabney 's school while the men talk about war and business . " " If it is war , Edward will like it , " Bess said . " He wo n't rest until we can get into the war . " There was a moment 's comfortable silence in the dining room when Mrs. Harcourt and Bess left them . Willis 's mind had moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room that he and Sylvia might have some day , with a table and a dozen very good Chippendale chairs from Mallet 's of Bath  --  and then his thoughts were interrupted by Mr. Bryson Harcourt 's voice . " Are you sure you do n't want a cigar , Willis ? " " No thank you , sir , " Willis said , " but if I might I would like a cigarette . " " By the way , " Mr. Harcourt said , " I should have asked you if you wanted to wash up before dinner . There is a lavatory in the closet below the front stairs , in case you need it , Willis . " " Thank you , sir , " Willis said , " but I really have no need of it . " " Well , then , " Mr. Bryson said , " your constitution 's stronger than mine . If you will excuse me , I shall visit it myself , and then I think I 'll call up Roger Harcourt so we can be sure to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willis ? " Edward asked . " Just a little , thank you , " Willis said . " Just a very small touch . " When he tasted it , he knew it was some of Mr. Henry Harcourt'sbrandy , and he thought of Mr. Percy Nagel in Mr. Harcourt'sprivate study long ago . " I do n't know what it was that you were talking to my father/in-law about , " Edward said , " but if it involves your coming back to the mill , I hope it works . I gather things are rather confused up there . I do n't know anything because I am in a law office , but Bess is always fussing about the mill  --  not that we depend on it much . " Willis discovered that he suddenly had a warm spot in his heart for Edward Ewing . " Of course the plant is small in a modern sense , " he said slowly , " but still it has real possibilities . I remember that Bess used to be . sentimental about it . " " Sentimental is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrelingabout the mill . " It was just as well to assume that Edward Ewing might not be as dull as he looked . It was not a time to show undue eagerness or a time to be fishing for information . It was better to drop the subject of the Harcourt Mill . " How 's the tennis ? " Willis asked . " Tennis ? " Edward repeated , and it was clear that he had entirelyforgotten . " I do n't suppose you remember , " Willis said . " No reason that you should . We played a set at the Harcourts ' one summer when I was working in the mill office . " He laughed easily . " I was lousy , perfectly lousy . " " Oh , " Edward said , " yes , I remember , and we had a swim in the pool . I 've given up tennis and taken up golf . " " Is that so ? " Willis said . " Well , I 'll take you on at that sometime . I 'm not so lousy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squaring of the circle , if he could play golf and beat Edward Ewing . " Not that I 'm any good , " Willis said , because it was never correctto say that one was good at golf . " But I get a whale of a lot of fun out of it . " Edward Ewing nodded and Willis had the pleasant feeling one always has when a difficult conversation ends on a common ground of interest . " How much do you go around in ? " Edward asked . " Oh , just a beginner 's score , " Willis said . " In the middle nineties or perhaps a stroke or two below . "  | " Oh , " Edward said . " Well , we must have a game . " Since Edward had not mentioned what he could go around in , he was , of course , a better player . It was ridiculous that Willis should have had a faint feeling of frustration . It was a relief when Mr. Bryson returned to the dining room . He was like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stored away for many years . " Do n't get up , " Mr. Bryson said , " please . I 'm sorry to have taken so long , but Roger would n't let me go . He hopes we can both be down at State Street at half past nine tomorrow morning . I hope that is n't too early . " " Oh , no , " Willis said . " It will be a real pleasure to see Mr. Roger again . " " I can drop by and pick you up , " Mr. Bryson said . " I forgot to ask where you were stopping , Willis . " " Thank you very much , sir , " Willis said . " I 'm at the Ritz . " " Well , that will be no trouble at all , if you 're at the Ritz , " Mr. Bryson said . It seemed to Willis that there had been a shade of surprise when the Ritz had been mentioned . " I usually stop at the Ritz when I 'm in Boston , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the moment after he said it , and not quite accurate , perhaps , because he had never stopped at the Ritz before . " I suppose if we do n't go upstairs we will be criticized , " Mr. Bryson said . " That 's right , " Edward said . " Bess gave me the word for us to come up as soon as possible , and you know Bess . " " Oh , yes , " Mr. Bryson said , " we all know Bess . " " Come here and sit beside me , Willis , " Mrs. Harcourt said , " and please tell me some more about the children . " " Well , " Willis said , " there is n't much to tell about Paul except that he 's a pretty hefty youngster , Mrs. Harcourt , but Al 's quite a boy  --  just in what I think is called the toddling stage . I wish I had a snapshot of him here . You know I really have a pretty warm spot in my heart for Al . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm sure you 're a very good father . Does n't  --  er  --  Sylvia think so ? " " Why did you name the second one Paul ? " Bess asked . Her voice came to him from across the room , showing that she had been listening all the while . " Sylvia named him after her grandfather , " Willis said . " Well , " Bess said , " as long as no one robbed Peter . " Willis smiled carefully and looked at Mrs. Harcourt . " I just meant robbing Peter to pay Paul , " Bess said . There was an undercurrent in her voice that puzzled him . " Paul is going to get along all right , " Willis said , " without anybodydoing any robbing for him . " The edginess in his own voice made Willis uneasy . It was not the way one should sound , considering the Rahway-Harcourt merger , and Willis turned quickly back to Mrs. Harcourt and to little Al and Paul and Sylvia 's ideas of decoration and nurses and hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , he was thinking , could anyone in Mrs. Harcourt 's positionreally know about himself or Sylvia ? There was luck in everything , but people like the Harcourts scarcely needed it . The money their family had accumulated had been increased by the clever management of other people , until the Harcourts were free from the Harcourt Mill itself . Mrs. Harcourt could give her dinners , Mr. Harcourt could sail his yacht races , and Bess could send her boys to Groton School , or some such place , no matter what happened to the Harcourt Mill . Of course , Willis was thinking , he had been lucky , but he had worked to earn his luck . What did the Harcourts know about scrimping to pay insurance policies and saving for new clothing , let alone a new car ?  --  absolutely nothing . What would happen to the Harcourts if they were thrown into the world ? Bill Harcourt could not have held a clerical job and Bess could not be a secretary or a switchboard operator . " You 're quite right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hot for Sylvia and the children in the summer , but she and the chil/dren do get off to Lake Sunapee for a month . The Hodgeses have a little camp there by the lake .... " It was lucky for the Harcourts that they did not have to earn their living . Willis stood up when he had finished talking about Lake Sunapee . " It 's been delightful renewing old associations , Mrs. Harcourt , " he said , " and thank you for asking me to dinner . I 've enjoyed every minute of it , but I must go now so that I can be ready for Mr. Harcourt in the morning . I think  --  at least I hope  --  that we are going to have a busy and worthwhile session . " He shook hands with Mrs. Harcourt . Then he squared his shoulders , assuming the alert posture that he had learned at BeakneyGraham . " Good night , Bess , " he said . " It 's been a real pleasure seeing you again . It 's been just like old times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least it had been tantalizing once . " Well , not quite like old times , " she said . " Well , no , " Willis said , " not quite , Bess . " She dropped his hand but she was still smiling . " If you finish all this business , " she said , " that you have to be so fresh for in the morning , would you like to come and have tea with me or something stronger ? You 'll need it after a day with Cousin Roger . " " Well , I would n't quite say that , Bess , " Willis said , " but it would be a great pleasure to have tea and to talk over old times with you and Edward . " " Edward wo n't be there , " Bess said . " He has to have his squash at teatime . It will be just you and me . The children never come to tea . " " Well , that will be all the better , Bess , " Willis said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . As soon after four-thirty as possible . By the way , I do n't think I remember where you 're liv-ing . " Willis whipped out his notebook and his Eversharp pencil . Dinnerat the Harcourts ' was over and he was feeling more tired than he had expected.  |p335IN  THOSE hectic years before and during the war Willis did not have much time for non-business reading except for his fifteen minutes a day with the Harvard Classics . There was no time for reading during the day , and frankly lie was pretty tired by the time he got home before supper for his play hour with the children . Usually , in the evenings he and Sylvia dined out with some of their new friends at the country club or had a couple in at home to play a rubber or so of bridge . Briefly , like most men he knew , Willis did not have much time to read . Yet some of the best people Willis knew gave serious thought to reading . Joe McKitterick , for whom Willis had a deep respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best plays and latest best sellers if only because he read the book-review section in the Sunday New York Times . In fact nearly all the other topflight people whom Willis met could cope intelligently with talk about the international situation , the columnists , Broadway hits , and best sellers . These things helped form the interests of a well-rounded man , and some of the best-rounded that Willis contacted frankly gave every appearance of enjoying this sort of talk . Almost in self-defenseWillis began doing a little reading when he was laid up with a cold or on Sunday mornings when Sylvia was servicing the children . Even when he was rushed he skimmed through the New York Times Book Review , and finally at the suggestion of Ted Perlman , one of the new salesmen he had hired at Rahway , Willis bought a useful periodical called The Book Review Digest . It was a relief to Willis that he already had acquired a certain literaryp336background . The Dickens and Thackeray , the Scott , the single Austen , and the Bronte which his mother had read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he reached forty . Also he discovered that there were ways of knowing about a book without having read it . For example , book reviewers , especially in the Sunday supplements , usually told you what it was all about . Besides reviews and condensations , Willis also read several fulllengthnovels , simply because Sylvia had talked so much about them . He read Babbitt by Sinclair Lewis only because Sylvia had once said , playfully , that he would get to be like Mr. Lewis 's Babbitt if he did not keep in touch with a few intellectual things . He also read The Prodigal Parents , and he got through half of Steinbeck 's Grapes of Wrath , but could not finish it because of its manifest unfairness . Somehow or other these and other novels , which , he thought , might have had a few cheerful thoughts in them , always left a bad taste in his mouth . Frankly , Willis preferred a plain down-to-earth writer like Dale Carnegie . It was shocking to Willis , but he had to face it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to like America . They did not like their country in spite of all the fine things America had done for them , such as the education it had given them and the chance to sell their books and motion-picture rights for enormous prices . They did not like America in spite of the opportunity America gave them to acquire lovely homes and have their pictures in Life and Time . These people were constantly sneering at solid institutions , snapping at the very hand that fed them . When they wrote about business , they looked upon people who earned an honest dollar by selling products , running banks or production lines as crass materialists , devoid of ideals and social conscience . Businessmen in all these novels were ruthless and very dumb . Willis often wished that he might have a talk with some of these writers . He wished that he could show them that men who ran factories and sold the products and dickered with bankers , tax examiners , and labor-union organizerswere not as dumb as a lot of novelists who always seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American businessman and not the novelist who hadp337created Palm Beach , and Willis was willing to bet that any topflightbusinessman , like old P. L. Nagel for instance , could take any blonde away from any novelist . The truth was that businessmenhad a lot of good ideas outside their fields . They understood , for one thing , a lot about human relations . Anyone who ran a big office force was naturally a better judge of character than a novelist . Businessmen could also put their thoughts succinctly into a few sentences , without writing pages and chapters . In this regard Willis never forgot the advice of old P. T. Green , president of the Green Gauge and Roller Company , who once did him the real honor of asking him to come over to Green Gauge . When you are out on a business trip , old P.T. used to say , whether or not you had been playing with other gals on the road , be sure to come home with a present for the wife and kids . Willis recollected that homely advice when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anything whatsoever for which to reproach himself . He had gone to Boston for an important piece of negotiation , and he had succeeded far better than he had hoped . By four o'clock the next afternoon it had been obvious that he and Mr. Bryson and Mr. Roger Harcourt had talked the whole deal into being and that all the dangerous corners had been rounded . It was a great relief to go and have tea with Bess . He and Bess had had tea entirely by themselves , sitting side by side on a sofa . Bess had asked him in a rather pointed manner to close the door to the hall . The Ewings were living in one of those old houses on Chestnut Street , and Bess had said that the house was very draughty , particularly in March . The only way you could keep warm was to close every door possible . It seemed to Willis that Bess , in spite of all her joking , was impressed by him , and in all modesty , he could see why , considering Edward Ewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with warmth and affection . You always knew where Edward stood , she had said , and that was something . Edward was just as easy as an old shoe , Bess had said , that never pinched you , and strangely enough , she could occasionally do with a pinch . By the time Bess had made this remark she had opened a small cupboard and had produced some of Edward 's Scotch . Then theyp338sat in a relaxed way on the sofa while Willis gave her a few highlightsabout Rahway Belt and the Harcourt Mill . It had been a friendly worthwhile visit and a useful one , because Bess had been right on his side from the very beginning . " Well , it will be like old times if you 're to be at the mill , " Bess said . It was an improvement over old times , but Willis had not forgottenSylvia for a single minute . When Bess had suggested that he stay for dinner , he had refused at once , because he had promised to go to the Hodgeses ' for supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After an early breakfast in the Grand Central Station Willis began to look for something to bring home , and it was a real pleasure to be thinking of Sylvia . It was so early that the gift would have to come from the Liggett 's , and fortunately this store contained a large selection of articles which had nothing to do with drugs . When one of the salesladies asked if she might help him , Willis smiled at her disarmingly . " Frankly , " Willis said , " I ca n't go home without some little gift for my wife and the two babies . " It always paid to take someoneinto your confidence . In half a minute he had bought a Teddy bear for Al and a rattle for little Paul . " We 've got some cut-price electric hair dryers , " the saleslady said . " Oh , no , " Willis said , " not a hair dryer . " " Bath salts ? " the saleslady said . " We have some very nice geranium bubble-bath salts . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stay at home for a few minutes , but there was nothing like that sense of homecoming . Little Al was in his play pen and he was very glad to get the Teddy bear . " Yoo hoo , " Willis called at the foot of the stairs . " Are you up there , honey ? " He felt an indescribable sense of relief when he heard Sylvia call back . Of course he knew that she would be up there but , at the same time , there was a shade of doubt , which perhaps other husbands shared . " Come on up , " Sylvia called . " I 'm giving Paul his breakfast . "  |p339Willis  knew enough about child rearing to understand perfectly that a breast-fed baby had a far better chance in later life than a bottle-fed baby . Breast-fed babies were less subject to adenoids ; their teeth came in straighter because their jaws were better developed . There was no real substitute for mothers ' milk . " Maybe I 'd better wait until Paul is finished , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any to have both Sylvia and the trained nurse laugh . " Now , Willis , " Sylvia said , " it 's time you learned the facts of life . Sit down and tell me everything . " It was not the time or place to tell Sylvia everything and besideshe had to get to the office . " I brought you a little present , honey , " Willis said . " Oh , Willis , " Sylvia said , " how sweet . What is it ? " " Bath salts . Geranium effervescent tablets . " " Oh , God , " Sylvia said , " not geranium ! " Sylvia was putting Paul through a process technically known to young mothers as bubbling . The resultant digestive sounds from Paul interrupted Willis 's train of thought . " How 's Mother ? " Sylvia asked . " She 's wonderful , " Willis said . " And so is your father . It is always a real pleasure to have a talk with him . Laura was away , of course . " Willis glanced nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on feeding him , are you ? " " Why , he 's only started , " Sylvia said . " What else ? " " Well , " Willis said , " everything is going even better than I hoped . " " Oh , I do n't mean that , " Sylvia said . " I mean about Father and Mother and Laura and Tom and everybody . " " Oh , " Willis said . " Well , frankly I was n't there long enough to learn everything  --  but I did gather from your mother that Laura has an admirer . " " Did Mother call him an admirer ? " Sylvia asked . " What 's he like ? Who is he ? Please try to remember . " It went to show how far women were removed from reality , that Sylvia should have expected him to remember details about a young man whom he 'd never seen.  | " His name just came up for a minute in the conversation , honey , " Willis said . " The only thing I can remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , no , " Sylvia said , " not the Harvard Business School ! " She began to laugh ; and until she did the connection had never occurredto Willis . " Honey , " he said , " I 'm sorry if you look down on the Harvard Business School . " " I do n't , dear , " Sylvia answered , " but you must admit it 's a coin-cidence . " " Honey , " he said , " I know this house is sort of tacky and it is a little small for two babies . I do n't honestly blame you if it makes you restless , and certainly a Harvard Business School graduate ought to do better . I promise to do something better as soon as I can . " " Why , Willis , I do n't know what put that into your head , " Sylvia told him . " I love this house and I keep asking you not to do extravagantthings . Just tell me everything that happened up in Boston . " It was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened , and besides he had to get down to the plant . And he also wanted to call on Mrs. Jacoby at the earliest possible moment . Yet in spite of all his preoccupation , that talk with Sylvia had given him a new idea . It was time they moved into a home of their own , and if you kept your eyes open there were some pretty good real-estate buys around the Oranges . Sylvia had asked him to tell her everything  --  a familiar but vague expression . Willis was only thirty-three , but his business experience was beginning to approximate , in many respects , that of someone close to forty , and he knew already that you never could tell anyone everything about anything , even yourself . For instance , there was one story which had to be prepared for the Rahwaystockholders and another story for Mrs. Jacoby and still anotherone for the negotiating lawyers . These stories all differed in detail , not because concealment was advisable but because certain people were more interested in certain facts than in others.  |p341When  everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belt with the Harcourt Mill were signed , Willis had attended a small dinner that the new company  --  now called Harcourt Associates  --  tendered to the new officers , directors and to some of the key personnel ; and the various negotiating lawyers were also present . Among the latter was Mr. F. Augustus Tremaine , who had always handled Mrs. Jacoby 's affairs and who had negotiated in behalf of the Rahway interests . Then there had been Mr. Tom Bolsen , Sr. , and his son T. Bolsen , Jr. , of the Boston firm that represented the Harcourts . Mr. Earl Decker had also been present in his capacity as general counsel for the Harcourt Mill . It had been a happy and friendly dinner . Even Mr. Tremaine , who had never missed a trick that Willis could remember , had been in a pleasant glow and had referred to Mr. Decker handsomelyin his after-dinner speech as his learned friend and advisor . Willis , as first vice president of Harcourt Associates , had made one of the main speeches of the evening , speaking not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owned personally 15 per cent of the common shares of the new company . Willis had given much time and thought to its preparation , and had been assisted now and then by a bright young Harvard Law School graduate who had recently entered Mr. Tremaine 's office . This assistance , however , was of a very minor nature , consisting of a little brushing up of paragraph and sentence structure  --  more of a clerical service than otherwise , and one which any executive expected from his organization when he had to make a speech . But all of the ideas the speech contained were original with Willis . It was highly gratifying that the speech made an even better impression than he had hoped . He had started slowly but he had built up to a real climax . " What is an idea ? " he asked in the beginning , adding facetiously , " I ought to know , after the last three months , when Mr. Tremaine and Mr. Bolsen and Mr. Decker have tossed around so many good ones . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant by tossing ideas around.  |p342Willis  was never quite sure whether he or the Harvard Law School graduate had set up these sentences , but it made no difference , because Willis was positive that the general conception was basically his own . " I may as well face the fact , " he continued , " that I may have been responsible in the beginning for the idea of merging Rahway Belt with Harcourt into our new strong company . But seriously , gentlemen , let us never forget that no idea can stand by itself . It must be activated to have value . A team must be behind it , and I think tonight we all know we have a real team . " Yes , gentlemen , an idea must be activated , and to achieve this end patience is necessary and an ability to understand what the other fellow has on his mind , but above all else , good fellowship and team play are the true ingredients of success . " He had to stop at this point until the applause died down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Willis said , " but I would like to leave just one more thought before I close . As a good sailor steers by a star let us , too , keep our eyes on the main objective . And what is that objective ? It is basically the joining of the Planeroid with the Hartex line  --  two complementary lines which will make a perfect unity of production . There is new competition in the belting industry tonight and new vigor . Let us all who have been responsible for this latest achievement rededicate ourselves anew to pushing forward a new sort of belting gospel . May I raise my glass in conclusion  --  and I wish it were a loving cup  --  to the unlimitedfuture of Harcourt Associates . " The setting and the mood were exactly right for everything that Willis had said . They were obviously on the threshold of new and unpredictable demands for conveyor belting , and a new aggressivecompany like Harcourt Associates could compete for those demands . " Willis , " Mr. Bryson Harcourt said , " that was a magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " Willis said . " I 'm very glad indeedif you think it went all right . " He could be deferential to Mr. Bryson Harcourt still , but they were both perfectly aware of a new relationship . Even if Mr. Bry/son or Mr. Roger wanted , neither of them could push him out of Harcourt Associates . Some such thoughts had been in back of Willis 's mind when he returned from Boston after that dinner . The Harcourts could not put him out of the new company , but still he would like to have a larger control of it . There was a chance of buying Mrs. Jacoby 's stock , if he only had the money . It would not hurt , he thought , to stop for a few hours in New York on his way home from Boston , and talk things over with a banker  --  and on this trip Willis never thought of bringing Sylvia a present . During the Harcourt negotiations Willis had begun to learn the banking facts of life . Among other things , he learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given the proper stimulus . Never be afraid to ask , and when you did , make it a substantial sum  --  the more the better , provided you came with a program of what you were going to accomplish in a business way . You had , of course , to develop a warm relationship with a banker first , so that he had a real belief in you and a keen personal interest . One of the best contacts along these lines that Willis had made was with a Yale graduate some ten years his senior named Gilbert Bakeliss . Gil , as Willis learned to call him , had sat in as one of the underwriters ' representatives on a lot of the Harcourt conferences . Willis admired the way Gil could keep facts in order , and he also admired Gil 's prematurely graying hair . He found that Gil , who was married and lived at Cos Cob , had a lot of good ideas about physical exercise and diet . When Willis had told Gil about sprinklingwheat germ over tomato juice Gil had been really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch at the Yale Club . It had been a pleasure to be in a position that enabled him to returnthe compliment . At Mr. Jacoby 's suggestion , Willis had joined the New York Harvard Club , a move which he had never regretted , either in a social or in a business way . Willis had explained to Gil , without unduly underlining the fact , that he was not really a Harvard man but a graduate of Boston University . He had , however , attended the Harvard School of Business Administration , which rendered him eligible for the New York Harvard Club . Much as Willis would have enjoyed hurrying back to **26;8646;TOOLONG of some deep , redeeming unity in life that makes beauty out of disgust . Then I felt a burst of shame at my own feeling , as though I had been detected in evil . I know that my face flushed , and I hung my head , pretending a new absorption in my task . I was so preoccupied that when I heard a strange voice there immediately before me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the colored man , the groom or whatever he was , leaning inward on the window sill , smiling at Michele from his brown , aging face . Then he spoke again , in a slow , slurring voice , the voice of the darkies back home , saying , " Mee-chele  --  howdy , Mishy-Honey . " The man was , I should judge , about fifty , rather grizzled , dark brown in the rather blunt wrinkled face , the wrinkles giving a quizzical expression , quizzicality mixed with a slow , amiable shrewdness . He was not tall , as I could tell from his posture at the sill , and though broad-shouldered , was sinewy and dry rather than bulky . His shirt sleeves were hacked off high up so that I could see the bare arms , lightly but strongly muscled , like a strong young boy 's , but with big veins standing out over the biceps . The hands , which hung into the room over the sill , looked extraordinarily large and coarse in comparison with the wrist bones . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or better , to have some cunning independentlife of their own , to be ready to stir , in a flash , from their present passivity into a strong action . He had addressed Michele as " Mishy-Honey , " and he simply did not seem to be the person to use that familiarity . Even as he spoke I expected some stinging rebuke . " Jimmee , " she replied calmly . " Mishy , " he said , " git me sumpum , some meat and bread or sumpum . I 'm hongry . I got de ole fam-f am , and ai n't no lie . " " If you have faim , " she said , with a not unkind gravity , " why do n't you get food from the kitchen ? " He shook his head , grinning at her . " Aw , Honey , " he said wheedling , " you git it . Doan taste so good , you doan git it . " She thrust her needle into the linen , rose and laid the work on the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell nothing from it . Then she went from the room , quick-footed and straight-backed . For the first time now the man turned his gaze on me , with a kind of indolent , friendly curiosity . " Done heared bout ye , " he announced . " Kantuck , " he said . Then :  | " Me  --  I 'm Tenn-see . But long back when they brung me down . But I reck-lict Tenn-see . Reck-lict me some them gals , high-juiced and sweet-smellin . I lak ' em bright-skinned , and Honey , I doan mind one monstous bit lookin at ye . " He was leaning in over the sill , the cunning , boyish , conniving grin on his wrinkled face . Then Michele 's voice called " Jimmee ! " She stood in the middle of the court , near the horse , a plate in one hand , a glass of milk in the other . Indolently , with a backward grin , the man went to her , stopped deliberately in front of her , squared himself , and while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk in the other , placed his right hand on the back of her neck , drew her face down to the level of his , for she must have been an inch taller than he , and kissed her a single big smack on the mouth . Then he stepped back , took the milk and the plate , and grinned at her . At the distance , I could see her flushing . Then fleetingly , she smiled at him , an indulgent , affectionate smile , and turned away . The smile was the most incongruous thing of all , the last thing I should have expected . As I puzzled over it , bending again at my needle , I was aware of some unease , some nagging discomfort , some sense of isolation . Why had the scene disturbed me ? I had the impulse to put it arbitrarily from my mind . But I was not permitted to do so . Michele had , meanwhile , returned to her seat . And now she asked , in a casual , quiet voice , not even looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " I started guiltily , so confused by what seemed her clairvoyant detection that I stammered , " What  --  what did who  --  who ? " " Him , " she said , with a shade of impatience that I took to be at my own disingenuousness . Beyond the window , beyond the patch of sun in which the horse yet stood , in the shade by the stable wall , the man was hunkered down on his heels , eating his sandwich , the glass of milk on the bricks before him . " What did he say ? " she repeated . " Oh , nothing , " I replied . " Just that he 'd heard of me being from Kentucky . " But I was sure I was flushing at my lie . " But you must not let him bother you , " she said . " He is just that way , and you can ignore him . Be kind , but ignore him . " What was she telling ? I asked myself that , even as the anger grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anger because I didp102not know why I had told the lie ? Then another anger : She tells me this because she thinks I am a Negro . And that manThat man , too , had taken me for a Negro , no better than himself . He had leered at me , had said what he said , high-juiced and sweetsmellin , high-juiced and sweet-smellin , and I saw again the wrinkled face as it had been when he leaned in , framed by the vines at the window , leering , old , old and Negro , and I was overwhelmed by my anger and revulsion . And then , in the same instant , as his image was vivid before me , in my mind , I saw his bare brown arms , the thin , strong muscles plaited over the boy-bone , and the big veins standing over the biceps under the slick skin , and where the shirt sleeve was hacked off , the slick brown curve of the shoulder , bright-filmed with sweat . And I was aware in a cold , fascinated awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touch that shoulder . But was it in me only now , at the recollected image , or had it been in me earlier , in reality , and I had not known it ? Had it been then , and that man , that Jimmee , had known it in his conniving grin ? I felt like leaping up and running from the room . But the woman 's voice was going on : "  --  is my husband . " The preposterousness of that announcement struck across my own feelings . I managed an incredulous question : " Him ? " And it flashed into my mind , with a sudden vindictive satisfaction , that she was jealous , that was it , jealous . But as though she could read my heart , she was saying : " I tell you this that you may not think I am jealous . It is-just the way he is . He has done things that he can not help . It may be he is the father of Dollie 's baby and  --  " " She has a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , but he denies it . And she says that the father is Rau-Ru , but she  --  " " Who is Rau-Ru ? " " You will see , in time . He calls himself the k'la of the master . You will see , and Dollie may say he is the father because she wants him . But she has lied before . She has lied about the master , I know . And the father may be Jimmee . Or who ? But if it is Jimmee  --  " she paused , lifted her needle from the task , and shrugged . " In any case , " she continued , " Jimmee and I , we understand each other . And he needs me . And "  --  she paused again , and now lookedp103straight at me as though mustering strength for a confession , then continued  --  " and I need him . And that , in life , is something . Not all , but something . " Without knowing why , I was embarrassed by her gaze , by the very air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should read it now . I had not clearly stated to myself my hopes for life , my yearning for love and fullness , but I was young , and in youth those things do not need to be stated . They are in your very breath . Even in my condition in the strange land and strange house , that must have been so . Now to hear that woman admit to the dwindling of life , the willingness to accept the little for the large , struck me with a frightening inner confusion . I feared , you might say , that some contagion in her eyes would seize me and I should be robbed of hope . So I dropped my gaze from her , and stared at my needle . But hope of what ? What could I , a slave , hope for ? I had finished the embroidery of the letter B and now pretended to be about to begin work on the design below it , the wavy line looping between the three peaks . I must have stared at it a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman 's voice , again . " Do you know what that is ? " she asked . " What what is ? " Her forefinger touched the wavy line under the B on my napkin . " It is the sea , " she said . " The sea ? " And I looked up , with some sense , I suppose , of the openness and release in that word , some flicker of that image of the sea . " It represents the sea , " she said . " For he "  --  and her forefinger now moved to the big B of the napkin on my knee  --  " he was long on the sea . " I looked down at the bold initial , as though it might divulge something . " He traded on the sea , " she said . " He has been in many countries . He has much to remember . " With that last statement , she touched her forefinger to her brow as though to indicate that the far life of Hamish Bond had been distilled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the straight black eyebrows and bulging gray eyes . In my mind I saw him on a ship , on the bridge I guess , on some high part , and the ship was heaving in a wind-wracked sea , andp104spume was flying before his face , but he seemed , somehow , motionlessand fixed in the middle of the great commotion . His mouth was open , and that strong voice was coming out against the wind , conqueringthe wind . It was saying : " I bid two thousand dollars  --  I bid two thousand dollars ! " Then , in the instant of its appearance , the fantasy was gone . There I was in the ordinary , pleasant room , and the woman had risen and laid her embroidery down , and was saying something about having to see how work was going on upstairs , and then she was gone . I said , out loud to the empty room : " I 've got to get out  --  I 've got to get out of this house ! " But I did not . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the kitchen . I was going back there to see that baby of Dollie 's . I was leaning over the basket , a basket set on a chair , staring at the little brown creature so sound asleep that a fly crawling over the bare chest did not disturb it . I was leaning thus , when Dollie 's voice broke in : " What you doin down heah ? " " The baby  --  " I began , by way of explanation , then stopped . Then I said : " It 's an awful pretty baby . " " You think hit 's so durn pretty , " she said , sourly , " hit is shore one thing hit doan cost no money to git . " At that I heard an unrestrained giggle from the shadows of the hall beyond the kitchen . " Doan tetch hit , " Dollie was saying to me . " All the botheration gittin hit down , and you wake hit up , I cut somebody 's thote . " Just after sunset I heard the stick in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching . Then Hamish Bond was standing on my door sill , filling the space . " May I come in ? " he asked , and at my nod , entered . He stood in the middle of the room , by the table where a lamp already burned . He carried a packet in his left hand , extended toward me . " It 's just something , " he said in his strong voice , then hesitated . " Just something I thought you might like , " he finished . I reached out and took the packet . " Thank you , " I said . He waited as though for me to investigate the contents , but Ip105made no move to do so , sensing , somehow , a victory in my restraint . He shifted his weight , then found his voice . " I 'm going away , " he said , " in a couple of days . While I 'm away , if you want anything , just ask Michele . " " Thank you , " I said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave me a sense of victory . " Good night , " he said , and moved toward the door . Halfway there , he stopped , and looked back . " What do you want me to call you ? " he asked . Before thinking , I had answered my familiar name , the name of childhood : " Manty  --  they call me Manty . " He seemed to reflect on that , then resumed his movement toward the door . At the sill , he looked back . He thrust his blackthorn in the direction of the packet in my hand . " That , " he said , " that 's nothing  --  justsomething I thought you might like . " His voice had some note of apology in it . Then turning away , he said : " Good night . " Then concluded , with a tinge of experimental uncertainty in his strong voice : "  --  Manty . " He was , at the next instant , beyond the jamb , out of my vision . But the word , the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetness in my heart . Then immediately I was overwhelmed with shame , shame at that sweetness , sweetness at that word from the mouth of the person who was most clearly my oppressor , the person to whom I was chattel , two thousand dollars ' worth of human flesh to be used at pleasure and discarded at will . It seemed shameful that in the depth of my being I had so longed for my name spoken that hearing it might dissolve my anger , dissolve all logic , dissolve my very being into the sweet impotence of childhood . But I suppose my response was only natural . I was , after all , not much more than a child . I had been snatched from my old world and dropped into a new one burgeoning with confused shadow and nameless terror . I had , in a way , lost my very identity . And in the lamplit room , my name , heard from the lips of that mysterious loomingcreature at the threshold where the lamplight scarcely penetrated , that creature who was the source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my identity . But now in my shame at my response , I angrily flung aside the parcel my master had given me , a bright parcel with ribbons.  |p106Later  , when Dollie came in , I pointed it out to her . " Take it , " I said indifferently , " whatever it is . " It was sweetmeats , what you give a child , and seeing that , my anger flared up again , as Dollie popped one of the things into her mouth , and stood there chewing it with mouth open , her face rapt in innocent inwardness  --  innocent and brutal , so it seemed to me in that moment of my disgust . She swallowed the last of the piece , and picked up the box . Then said : " You kin hole my baby sometime , you want . " " Thank you , " I said , feeling , suddenly , that I never wanted to see that small creature again , and I was sure that I caught , mysteriously , the faint scent of urine and sour milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . Dollie went to the door . Just as she reached it , with a flash of cold , inspired , calculated cruelty , I said : " Who is Rau-Ru ? " She turned . " Him ? " she said . " Rau-Ru ? " Then : " Ai n't no common nigger  --  naw , Lawd , flaw , Lawd ! " And sniggered , sniggering off down the hall . So that was the first day I ventured down into the house of Hamish Bond . That night , as I lay abed , the images of the day came and went in my head , but I could not find their meaning , their continuity . Then idly , among the flowing recapitulation of images , the image of Jimmee came to me , leaning in the window with his quizzical , wrinkled face . And all at once , it was the face of Shaddy , Old Shaddy , back at Starrwood . I rose up in bed , on my elbow , as at a cry in the night , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension , to guilt , to fear . Then I thought : I told on Shadrach and they sold him away , and that is why I , too , have been sold away , into slavery . If that was true , then I would never be able to escape . How crazy my hope had been ! Then a sense of injustice came over me . Why should I suffer because of Shadrach , one of thousands , tens of thousands , sold away , another common old nigger , sold away ? Why should I suffer for that ? Ai n't no common nigger  --  naw , Lawd , naw , Lawd ! : but that wasnot about Shadrach , that was about Rau-Ru , what Dollie had said about Rau-Ru , sniggering off down the hall.  |p107But  next morning came , and I said to Michele : " Who is Rau-Ru ? " " He ran the master 's plantation , one of them , upriver , " she said , " the one at Pointe du Loup . " " Where does he get such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " echoed Michele , and added that the name was like any name . " But where does it come from ? " I insisted . " From his own country , " she said . " But where  --  where is that ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " You mean he is not from America ? " " No . " " But where ? " " I do n't know , not precisely , " she said . " When he first came to the island , he  --  " " Island  --  what island ? " " The island  --  a little island near Cuba . ' Sieur ' Amsh , he brought him . " " And then Mr. Bond brought him here ? " I demanded . " Yes . " " Ah , " I said , and leaned forward peremptorily , like a prosecutor , like a teacher , " and so Mr. Bond broke the law "  --  oh , yes , I knew that law , we all knew it at Oberlin . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Rau-Ru , could have denounced Mr. Bond for holding him a slave , and  --  " " A slave  --  " Michele interrupted . " Rau-Ru would think it queer to hear himself called a slave . " " Well , " I demanded , hearing my voice edged with the dry , thin , triumphant irony of pedagogy , " what is he then ? " " He is the k'la , " she said , and rose abruptly , and left me . What was the k'la ? And as I turned the question over in my mind , I suddenly remembered that Michele , too , had come from another country , from that island , she had just said , whatever that island was , and Hamish Bond had brought her in as a slave . And so , inflamed by my thought , I ran down the hall and up the stairs , to the door of the room occupied by Hamish Bond , for I had heard the tap of her heels in that direction . The door was open . I stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that room , a big , bare , sun-swept room , with tremendousbed , armoire and bureau , grand and expensive , gilded and festooned , and masculine apparel flung here and there with imperial carelessness . Michele had already looped back the net and was stripping the bed to remake it . I had come down the hall at top speed , ready to dash up and confront Michele with my dazzling idea . But now , all at once , I stopped at the threshold , as though the sill were a mystic line I might not cross . Michele , holding a bolster in her hand , looked up at me in surprise . I was speaking , jumbling my words forth , as though the spoken words but continued , without interruption , the discourse in my head : "  --  yes , you 're a slave  --  you said you wereesclave , you said  --  and Hamish Bond brought you in , and it 's against the law  --  and you , you can denounce him now , even now  --  " I concluded in breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster forgotten in her hands . " Why did n't you denounce him ? " I demanded angrily , leaning over the sill . " Because , " she said , " there was no reason to do so . " " But you were a slave , " I urged , my anger mounting , " un'esclave , un'esclave , that 's what you said yourself , and  --  " " Oh , go away ! " she burst out at me , and I saw her fingers clench the bolster . I was frozen by surprise , surprise and , I suppose , terror at seeing the ice of her calm crack , the mask of her calm dropped . " Oh , go away ! " she cried again . And cried out : " Why  --  why did you ever come to this house ? " And she flung the bolster down on the bed . That action released me . I fled up the hall , to the floor above , to my room , and shut the door . Later , she found me there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of betrayal , huddling away from her touch as she tried to reach me to lay a hand on my shoulder . She was sorry , she said . She had come to apologize , she said . And said : " Oh , everything was so long ago . Things are so long ago , and you think they are gone , but then , all at once , for just a moment , they are not gone . " She touched my shoulder . " Ma petite , " she said , " forgive me. "  |p109Two  days later , Michele came to my room and announced that ' Sieur ' Amsh had gone upriver , to Pointe du Loup , for a few days , but had left orders for her to take me into town . For what , I asked . To buy material for clothes . I told her I wanted nothing . What were clothes for me ? " If you do not go , " she said , " I can not make you . But it would be a distress for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went . I was tense with excitement . All the possibilities of flight , of freedom crowded my head . This was the beginning . I would observe everything . I would learn the city . I would be ready when the time came . In the shops they called me " Miss " or " Mademoiselle , " and gave the deference due to a young lady of breeding , with money to spend . And Michele stood at my elbow , like the faithful nurse . Yes , once I was past that great beast of a dog , and out the iron gate of Hamish Bond 's house , freedom would be easy . I would be lost in a world of white faces . Meanwhile , I hugged the irony : the Miss , the Mademoiselle , addressed to me , the slave . How that knowledge would have pinched their pride , those counter-jumpers ! But there was another irony to come , as the days drifted past , and the dressmaker came and made me the dresses , and they were beautiful , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next it was the last irony : beautiful dresses for me , the slave . I stared at them with a sick lassitude . I sat with Michele and embroidered the napkins , the bold B over the looped symbol of sea waves . I went into the kitchen and leaned over the brown baby . I held it in my arms , and tested a painful division in my emotion . I found the kitten in the back patio , and took it to my room and fed it and loved it . I wandered over the house , the shadowy rooms with the gilt and brass of the garnishings of the furniture , massive Empire it was , glinting in the dimness , the office or study of Hamish Bond , where a great brass binnacle sat on a table like an altar , and books and papers were flung about in disorder , and strange weapons , all shapes of blades , straight or curved or wavy , thick or thin , long or short , swords and scimitars and krisses , glimmered wickedly on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become of me , and my heart pounded in the silence . " What will become of me ? " I cried out to Michele , and she laid her embroidery down and looked at me.  | " Ma petite , " she said , calmly , " you will live . " And there was no irony in her voice . But that was no answer . So I demanded : " What did he do it for ? " " Who ? " she asked . " He , " I said , and jabbed my needle at the big B on my napkin . " Do what ? " she said . " Buy me , " I replied . " Why did he buy me ? " And as I pronounced the word buy , and repeated it , a strange sensation came over me , something like anger , then a faint sickness coupled with a nameless agitation , this succeeded by a slight sensation just below , and at , the nipples on my breasts , a sensation both of being bruised and of tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " I do n't know , " she said . " There could be so many reasons , and I do n't know which . For that matter , " she continued , " he himself may not know . " " But why did he do it ? " " I do n't know , " she said , patiently . " But he is a kind man , and you are fortunate . But it is a strange kindness . It is not like the kindness of people ordinarily , for you can understand that sort of kindness . But he  --  " She paused , reflecting . Then : " You might say that his kindness is like a disease . He has it as a man might have a long disease . "  | " IT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL DRESS , " HAMISH BOND SAID GRAVELY , ANDreached out the blackthorn to touch with its tip the hem of the skirt as I stood there , just inside the door of the dining room , for his inspection . It was a beautiful dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers lightly caress the pink bouffant skirt , slashed with chocolatecolor . I saw the tip of the blackthorn still touching the hem . Then I heard his voice : " I told Michele to ask you to let me see one of your new dresses just because  --  " He hesitated , and I heard the slight sound of his shift of weight . " Because , " he resumed , " I thought you might eat dinner with me . " I did not look up . " Of course , " he was saying , " if you prefer eating with Michele , as you have been doing , then  --  " He hesitated again . Then : " Would you mind ? " " No , sir , I do n't mind , " I said , and still did not look up . What else was there for me to say ? So he sat at one end of the big table , in front of the silver candelabra , and I at one side , a little to his right , and Jimmee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boy-muscled shoulders , but stiff in a buttoned-up black coat , poured claret , andp112Hamish Bond tried to talk with me , talking of indifferent things , the weather , his trip to his plantation upriver , the culture of cane , and I lifted my eyes from my plate only to say yes , sir , or no , sir . Then , at last there was a period of silence . I did not look up to see his face , but I could see against the whiteness of the tablecloth , his right hand reach out for his wineglass , a strong hand , heavy-jointed , browned by weather , sparsely sprigged by strong black hairs . Then , with a start , I saw what I had never noticed before : the second finger of the hand was cut off just below the first joint . There was just the stub left , blunt and healed over with a painful twist of tissue . I saw the fingers slowly revolve the wineglass , then stop . Then in a voice that filled the room with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " This is foolishness ! " I looked sharply up at him . But his face showed nothing except , perhaps , a more than usual glitter of the eyes . " This is foolishness , " he repeated , in a more moderate voice . " You do n't have to eat here . And I do n't have to listen to myself talking this damned nonsense . I just reckoned it would n't be so lonesome , if you ate here . " He stopped , then all at once leaned at me , and with a flicker of ferocity in his tone , asked : " Do n't you want some dessert ? " I shook my head . " Dollie can bring it right now . " " No thanks , " I said . " You do n't have to ever eat here , " he said . I slipped from my chair , and stood there , my hands hanging at my sides . " Excuse me , " I said . He said nothing , and I began to move toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost running . At the top of the stairs , in the dark hall , I stopped and heard my heart 's preternatural beating . What was it beating for ? The effort of scrambling up the stairs , fear , excitement ? All of those things , but also from a sense of victory , of power , and crazily , there floating in the dark , I saw the image of his hand on the white , candle-lit tablecloth , the strong flesh , browned by weather , sprigged by black hairs , the fingers turning the stem of the wineglass , the stub of the amputated second finger sticking out to exhibit the painful twist of tissue . The next night , at the hour of his dinner , I came down . He was already seated . A quick glance told me that my place was laid.  |p113He  straightened up , and gave me what I took to be a stem forbiddinglook . Then he smiled . I had never seen him smile before , and a smile on that heavy , square-jawed , bulge-eyed face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through on a gray day to make a land of wet rock look gilded and bright . The flesh crinkled up around the eyes and the heavy lips pulled back and up and the smile was really a kind of grin , a grin of boyishness , of shamefaced ferocious boyishness . " Well , Manty  --  Manty , " he was saying , " so you decided to give the old fellow 's damned nonsense one more try , huh ? " I found myself smiling back at him . For no reason , just because his grin caught me into that . But when I detected the smile on my face , I quickly recomposed my expression . " Be damned , gal , " he was saying , " you can smile . I caught you right red-handed at it , gal . I never reckoned you could . " Later that night , as I lay abed , I thought about finding my place at the table already laid . Had he been sure I would come ? I felt a flicker of anger at him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt a kind of warm , comforting peace at the thought that somebody did know , or care , what you were going to do . Knew even better than you yourself . It was like an arm being put aroundyour shoulders . But suppose the place had not been laid , and waiting ? Thatthought struck me with a frightful chill . Could I have borne that coldness , that rejection ? I felt lonesome and forlorn , lying there in the dark . Oh , that 's silly , just silly , I said to myself , for I knew now that I could , in the end , escape . I knew my power . The season , with its strange somnambulistic , submarine muffling and muting , moved on into summer . The heat and dampness hung like gauze in the afternoon brilliance . The shadows in the courtyardlay on the sun-glittering stone like black tin , the straight-edged black shadow of the wall , the jag-edged shadow of vine , the ovoidal shadows of the orange trees . Sometimes , lying in my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black jags against the brilliance of sky , I wanted to scream out to break the silence . But a sound would then come , the creak of a cart , a call far off , the hoot of a steamboat . There was the sense of time being wound tighterp114and tighter , like thread on a bobbin , of your nerves being wound . And the heat was worse , day by day . " We should have left before now , " Michele said one morning . " To go where ? " I asked . " Pointe du Loup , " she said . " Only once have we stayed in the city so late . In ' 53 . And that was folly . It was la saison de la fievre . " " La fievre ? " I echoed . " La fievre Taune , " she said . " Bronze John . Ten thousand died . But he stayed . " " Who stayed ? " " Who do you think ? " she queried in mild surprise , laying aside the embroidery . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , and it was folly , for he might have gone and been safe . But une folie noble . It was the disease of his kindness . " " Did he make you stay and be noble , too ? " I asked , ironically . " You and the others ? " " No , " she said . " ' Sieur ' Amsh , he told those who wished to go to the country that they might go . Some went . Dollie went . Jimmee would have gone , for he is a man natural , but I said that if he went , I would never again lie down beside him and I would spit on his food as I set it before him . So he stayed , and once he had stayed and there was the great dying , he behaved well , and laughed a great deal , for , as I said , he is un homme naturel , and does the best he can when there is no help for it . " My hands moved , folding cloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This house was full of the sick and dying . ' Sieur ' Amsh had them brought here . We worked the best we could ; he , too , the best he could with his infirm leg . At noon in the city the air was always black with smoke , for barrels of tar were burning in the streets to kill infection . Cannon were everywhere in the street and they fired all day to drive off the impurity of air . The sound of cannon that would not stop made the sick ones have convulsions , some of them . Birds did not fly across the sky . " People died in the street and lay there . They could not bury the dead , there were so many . They piled them like cord wood and burned them , and everything did not burn well , and when all was cooled the dogs came . They shot dogs in the street and they lay there . " Many people died in our house , for all we could do . We heard the cries of men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always drunk , and who could blame them ? They stopped at the gate and rang the bell loud , and shouted , Des morts  --  avezvousdes morts ! ' Then there came the Black Day at the end of Augustwhen more died than ever , and all seemed doomed . But the storms came , and the dying stopped . " We went to Pointe du Loup , at last . Then it all seemed a bad dream , even the times when you yourself had wanted , to die , for there was no reason to live . " The corn-pulling time was over when we came . " But now was now , in New Orleans , summer , but no fever . When night came , darkness would be sudden , like a knife-edge . Often in the evenings , after our dinner , we walked into the back courtyard , where a light barouche waited , the matched bays now and then clinking their shoes on the stone in discreet impatience . Their coats glistened with muted richness in the light of the big lantern suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insects revolved about the lantern , some great heavy , horny things that clanged like metal against the glass , and made a click then when they fell to the stone , some small as midges , glittering like gold dust , spinning in the orb of light of which the lantern was center . Hamish Bond handed me up into the vehicle , then braced himself on his stick , lifted his left foot to set it on the edge of the floor of the vehicle , cramping his thigh upward for the unnatural posture , and heaved up with a strange swooping , athletic motion . It was astonishing . It was as though , at that moment , you saw two persons , the burly man of middle years , with the lame leg and clumsy power , and somehow , trapped in that bulk but shining through it like light behind dingy glass , the form of a youth , supple , thin-hipped , long-armed , high-headed , leaping into the air , suspended in the air like a bird , beyond reason and gravity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lurch dangerouslyas his left leg drove down to heave up his weight , lurch like a small boat when a wave hits broadside . The first time it happened , feeling that plunge and seeing that shocking apparition heave above me , I screamed . It was n't a loud scream , but nevertheless , a scream . " Manty , Manty ! " he exclaimed , standing there in the swaying barouche , swinging his right arm wide to maintain his balance , the blackthorn in that hand like a cutlass , laughing with some strainp116of wild , unexpected gaiety , saying , " Ha , ha ! Manty  --  did I skeer you , Manty ? Did I skeer you , little Manty ? " Then he sat down , suddenly his burly , decorous self . " Out the shell road , " Hamish Bond ordered Jimmee , and we passed over the uneasy streets , where people moved in the flickering light of the street lamps , fathers with their large families , moving ceremoniously forward like a flock grazing in formation , young lovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering , and thin gold-headed canes , young men already edged by their evening arrogance and wine . Somewhere , far off , would be the sound of music . Then we would pass the outlying districts , huts precariously hung together of junk , old boards and palmetto leaves , a smudge-fire glowingbefore each one , and around the fire crouched human forms , the firelight touching the faces with a strange intensity in the general darkness . But the night was hot , and those romantic fires were smudges , just smudges to drive off mosquitoes . Along part of our way , the fires were reflected in the water and gilt scum of a big ditch or bayou . Jimmee 's matched bays would slip into their long , easy stride , and our wheels would hiss over the crushed shell . If there was moonlightit would have the pinkish glow . If no moon , the stars would seem very steady and bright in the blackness . Often there was heat lightning . That far-off , uneasy flickering made the whole dark land seem to rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a great secret water . At Lake Pontchartrain the water stretched mysteriouslyaway northward , under the moonlight , starlight , or uneasinessof lightning . I had never seen that much water . It was like the ocean , I thought . We ate an ice , and I looked across the water . Once I said to HamishBond that it was beautiful . " A pond , " he replied , " a cow-pond full of mud-turtles . " Then added : " You ought to see Genoa . At night , I mean . When you 're laying off , hove to , and the lights show way up yonder on the mountain . " I replied politely that I should like to see it . He did not seem to hear me . Then said , with some grimness : " I 've seen it . I 've laid out there , beyond the roadstead , and seen it . All night long . You see the lights go out , one by one , up there on the mountain , only the last ones left . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen a lot of things . A man sees a lot in his time , butp117I do n't know what good it does him . " He waited again . Then : " I 've laid off Teneriffe , too , and seen the lights . " Some nights , not often however , guests came to the house of HamishBond . On those nights I had my dinner with Michele , as before . Sitting in our little room we might catch the sound of laughter , or a voice raised in argument . They were always male voices , for no ladies came to this house . " There was a time when they came , " Michele told me . " Grandes dames , even Madame Gouvier , she came  --  the aunt of ' Sieur PrieurDenis  --  withher hair white and piled up this high  --  " And she indicatedwith her long flexible golden hand the height above her own head . " And the diamonds , " she continued , and touched her breast where a brooch might have been . " But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epoque . " " When ? " I asked . " Long ago , " she said . " When ? " " Twelve , fifteen years ago . It was the time when  --  when it seemed that he was to marry . He was betrothed , in the end . " She had just finished the wavy loops beneath the big B. Now she spread the napkinon her knee and inspected the perfection of her work . " Who was she ? " " She had very black eyes . You can not imagine how black , in her paleness . And her hair was black . They said she was beautiful . " " Was she ? " I asked . Michele looked at me , suddenly with the old distant , assessing look of the first days of my arrival in the house of Hamish Bond . " How do I know ? " she demanded . But Hamish Bond had not married the beautiful young woman , who was named , I learned , Mathilde . Why ? " How do I know ? " Michele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a convent . Where , according to Michele 's suddenly acid comment , she had probably belonged . So now the voices in the other room were always voices of men , the voice of a Mr. De Bow , who had a magazine , the voice of MonsieurCharles de Marigny Prieur-Denis , who was rich , a dandy and gallant , a cousin of Hamish Bond , the voice  --  one evening only  --  of Mr. Judah Benjamin , who , they said , was a Senator from Washing/ton , the voices of other men talking about politics , about cotton , about sugar , about slaves , about money , about tariff . And later , when they had all gone , and all that was left was the smeared glasses and the empty port decanter over which a last wakefulfly buzzed fretfully , Hamish Bond would come back , and tap the floor with his stick , and say , " God-a-Mighty , Manty , the world is full of fools ! " And once , having uttered that dictum , he looked sharply at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lowered my eyes . Then , dourly , he said : " Fools , yeah . And I 'm the biggest . " Then I heard his voice : " You do n't have to sit up all night and hear tell of all the fools in the world . " Then : " Off to bed with you , little Manty ! " Then Rau-Ru came . As I came down to the study one June evening , I encountered Dollie in the hall . She leaned at me , whispering : " The k'la  --  he done come ! " But what was the k'la ? And a half-minute later , when I had entered the room where the big ship 's compass glittered , and the metals of the barbarous display on the walls , the krisses and cutlasses and scimitars , and had greeted Hamish , Dollie burst in , forgetting manners , and said to her master : " He done heah ! " And Hamish said : " Send him in . " I do n't know what I had expected , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red sash , that all at once , but withouthaste , was there before us , the face of preternatural blackness , like enameled steel , against the white of the loose blouse . For an instant he stood there , and I saw that his eyes were wide , large , and deep-set , his nose wide but not flattened , the under-lip full , if not to the comic fullness favored in the make-up of minstrel shows of our day , and the corners of the mouth were drawn back so that the effect of that mouth was one of arrogant reserve and not blubbering docility . A mustache of a few hairs hung wispily down below the corners of the mouth , in a kind of ambitious boyishness . How funny , I thought , looking at that mustache , how funny ! But at the same time I found myself smiling with a kind of indulgenceas though that strong figure were younger than I. Actually , he was a lot older than I , about twenty-five.  |p119The  duration of Rau-Ru 's pause there in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , but it was the moment of my first impression , and is therefore fixed forever , balanced there , and beyond the white-clad figure , yonder in the hall , is Dollie peeringsecretly in . I had remembered that , according to Michele , Dollie boasted Rau-Ru the father of her child . The little liar , I now thought . All this in the fixed instant of his pause . Then he had stepped toward Hamish Bond , had seized his right hand , bowed over it , and to my astonishment , had kissed it . No , that was n't what he did , I suddenly realized . He had touched his brow to the back of the hand . He straightened up , and Hamish Bond grabbed him by the right shoulder  --  this with Hamish Bond 's left hand  --  and with his right hand slapped Rau-Ru 's left shoulder in the immemorial gesture of fatherly affection . " Rau-Ru , Rau-Ru , " he said , grinning , and then uttered a spate of outlandish gabble , much like the racket of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , standing happily under the friendly slaps . And all at once I felt cut off , outside , displaced . I was not , after all , the favorite . I did not ask myself : the favorite what ? And so did not have to reply : the favorite slave . As matters stood , my jealousy had scarcely time to be converted into a contempt for that barbarous communal gabble , before Hamish Bond turned suddenly to me , with the air of a host apologetic at an oversight , and with his left hand still on Rau-Ru 's shoulder , said : " This is Rau-Ru . " Even as I somewhat coldly inclined my head to acknowledge the introduction , I was thinking : How is he going to introduce me ? Like one slave to another ? And was aware , in that split second , of the blackness of the fellow , for all his nigger finery . And aware of the whiteness of my small hands laid decorously together at my waist . For that same split second Hamish Bond seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate question . If he was debatingthe question , he solved it by ignoring it . He did not identify me . " You 've heard of Rau-Ru , " was all he said . I had heard of him , yes , but had probably heard less than anybody else in Louisiana . Old Man Bond 's free nigger , that high-mucka-muckof Bond 's free niggers ( for all the slaves of any master who inclined to more than the minimum of decency might get thatp120name ) , Bond 's high-stepper , Big Bond 's boss driver , Big Bond 's Fancy-Pants  --  yes , Rau-Ru was famous . No constable or paddy-roll ever stopped him . No steamboat captain ever asked to see his pass . No snag-toothed dirt-farmer or swamp-rat ever let the pent-up outrage of his own deprivation flare in word or blow at the sight of Rau-Ru 's slick finery . He was Old Man Bond 's nigger . I had heard of him , but not yet those things , and the other things . All I knew now was that he practically ran Hamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not  --  the father of that child of Dollie 's that I had dandled in the kitchen , that his presence and the secret gabble with Hamish Bond made me feel rejected and cut off . That summer he would go and come in the house . He would disappearupriver , and return . He would sit long hours with Hamish Bond in the study at some business . ( Unlike Jimmee , or the other slaves , when he appeared before his master , he was always invited to sit . And I recall now that they used to say that Jefferson Davis , at his place up in Mississippi , had his Isaiah Montgomery sit with him . ) But when Rau-Ru was not with the master he might be lounging in the patio , by an orange tree , in delicious idleness , slowly , whisperingly , whetting the blade of his knife on the big stone urn in which the tree grew , spitting delicately now and then on the stone to lubricatethe fastidious motion . Or he would lounge there and read from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes he would meet me in the house and startle me , for he moved without noise , on a cat-stride , setting the foot down , the patent-leather boot down , as though weightless in a dream . How white , in the shadowy hall , his eyeballs shone against the enameled blackness of his face ! But I also met Charles de Marigny Prieur-Denis in that hall . He was , as Michele had told me , a kinsman of Hamish Bond , by the American mother of Prieur-Denis . He was the only one of those gentlemen who gathered for the evenings of wine and conversation with Hamish who ever came by daylight , and the only one , I was about to say , who was to have any significance for my life . But that last would have been a lie , for how much of my life had been , and was to be , defined by men like those men whom I heard only behind the door of the dining room , men sitting around a table , after the duck or venison or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , after the walnuts , men fingering slowly the port glass , thep121brandy glass ? Men at their after-dinner ease , heavy with food and opinion , off in Virginia , in Kentucky , in Massachusetts , in New York ? Men sitting at dinner long before my birth ? As for Charles I saw him first in the hall of the house of Hamish Bond , in the middle of a summer afternoon . I was just coming down to the foot of the stairs , after my siesta , and there he was , a figure in white trousers and black coat of a silky sheen , and loose black tie , leaning lightly on a gold-headed cane , looking up the stair at me . He was a youngish-looking man . His face was oval but strongfeatured , with a black mustache , the skin an even olive tone , and large brown eyes of melancholy beauty . When I looked up and discovered him there , I uttered a Iittle cry of surprise . For a moment , he stood there regarding me , not speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to learn , that was not of heaviness but of litheness , an immobility in which you felt latent the untriggered swiftness and grace . He stood there in his silence , which was a gift of his , too . But a sort of smile was growing on his face , and watching that smile , which seemed to have a soft sweetness insinuated with its confident amusement , I found myself beginning to smile , as an apology , I reckon , for my little scream . " You came , " he said then , " soft as  --  " He hesitated , as though searching the precise and inevitable comparison , lifting his right hand , with thumb and forefinger just touching at the tips , in a gesture of histrionic grace , then said : "  --  as the dew of dawn . Doucementcomme la rosee de l'aube . " " I am sorry I screamed , " I said , in French . " You 'll have to let me improve your French , " he said with a pedagogicalseverity . But he suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the moment . I shall give you a lesson , now . Say after me , please : Je viens doucement comme la rosee de l'aube . " In my embarrassment , I could n't reply . " Say it , " he commanded severely , and began again : Je viens douce-ment  --  " Then , with relief , I heard the tap of Hamish Bond 's stick , back in the gloom of the house , approaching . Later that summer , I encountered Monsieur Prieur-Denis at varioustimes . He was free of the house , and might be found at anyp122moment , in the hall or patio , or sitting at ease in the study . WheneverI saw him , he would not greet me , but would lift his forefinger severely , and command : " Repete , ma petite , je viens doucement  --  " And always I flushed with embarrassment , and wanted to run away , away from that sudden smile with its sweetness , its gay irony , its confidence . Then one day it was different . It was late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of the back of the house , into the hall , and there he was , as on the first day , standing at ease , waiting . He lifted his finger at me , in his joke , his lips parted to speak , and I saw the even , very white teeth under the precise black mustache , the gleam of the damp lower lip . I do n't know what got into me , what caused it . It was n't a decision , I felt a tingle of boldness , I felt my head go up as at a dare , and before Monsieur Prieur-Denis could utter a word of that joke , which suddenly seemed to me silly and childish , I heard my voice saying , firmly : " Je viens doucement comme la rosee de l'aube . " I stared him straight in the eye , and heard my heart pounding with triumph . " Ah , " Monsieur Prieur-Denis said , " so you have learned your lesson , and  --  " But I never heard the end of the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , dodging past him , across the hall , up the stairs , carrying my beating heart and my triumph into the quiet upper reaches of the house . That triumph was but part of the great triumph I now confidently awaited , that new confidence but part of my confidence in freedom . I lay in my bed at night and saw the great white steamboat churningup the brown river , away , away , and I would be on it , leaving the house of Hamish Bond far behind me . Now every time I smiled , and saw his face soften , I would think : that smile is oil on the lock , it will open . For the time , I knew , was coming on . One by one the difficulties I had earlier envisaged seemed to solve themselves . I had known that I had to learn the city to escape . I had feared the great brute of a nigger-dog that waited in the patio . I had wondered how I would get money . But at Hamish Bond 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . And she gave me money , this too , at Hamish Bond 's command . When I was out with her , on the early expeditions , I spentp123money with childish carelessness , to deceive her , to make her think I put no store by it . Then , when I should be able to go alone she would not wonder about what became of my money  --  the money I would be hoarding . But for a long time there had been no chance of going out alone . I was afraid of the dog . I was , however , very clever about that . I congratulated myself on my cleverness . I did n't thank Hamish Bond immediately for the money . I waited for some days , and for two or three trips into the city with Michele , before mentioning it . Then , one evening I thanked him . It was nice to have money , I said , to spend for my fancy . But , I added with calculated girlish wistfulness , it was somewhat hard on Michele to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try to be more consideratein the future . " Huh , " he said , " why do n't you go by yourself ? " I hesitated , gauging the moment . Then said : " The dog . " " The dog ? " he echoed , in question . Then he laughed . He laughed fit to kill . In the middle of laughing , he managed to say : " You mean old Rob Roy ? You mean that old cow ? " He rose from the table and I heard him go out into the hall and open the front door . Then I heard the tap of his returning blackthorn , and between those taps , the click of the nails of the beast on the polished floor , approaching . Then the dog came into the room , ahead of the master , into the circle of candlelight , and stared at me from the great , blank , goldcoloredeyes . " Pat him , " Hamish Bond 's voice commanded , " pat the pore ole booger . " I looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jowls slackly hanging , in that very slackness an obscene bestiality , the red , wet tongue hanging out of the jaws between white tushes . " Pat him , " the voice said . I put out my hand and touched the beast 's head . My first sensation was of the massiveness of bone beneath my fingers . Then , with shocking suddenness , the beast dropped from beneath my fingers , dropped as though it had been shot , right to the floor . As my hand yet hung in the air , the beast rolled over on its back , with an awkward , heaving motion , the parody of a puppy 's playfulness , and layp124there with white belly and throat exposed , tongue lolling foolishly out one side of the dangerous jaws , big , black forepaws flopping idly in the air . " See , " Hamish Bond was saying , " see the pore old booger , he would n't hurt a fly . " " Yes , sir , " I said , looking down at the thing , the thin powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulge of the scrotum , the big bulge of the chest , all that dangerousness ridiculouslynegated by the silly waving paws and flopping tongue . " So pore little Manty was afraid of you , you booger , " Hamish Bond was saying , leaning over to scratch the under-throat of the beast . " Pore little Manty was afraid of you  --  silly little Manty . " Silly little Manty , indeed ! And suddenly I felt contempt for Hamish Bond . He was a fool . I 'd walk past his silly brute and be gone , and then  --  then he 'd wish  --  he 'd wish what ? He would wish that he had had a real nigger-dog , a great beast of a dog . And into my mind the great beast of fable leaped , with the throaty exhalation and thud a great beast makes at the end of the leap , a killer of a beast , eyes wide and burning , tushes a-gleam . Contemptuously , with my patent-leather toe , I prodded the disorganizedcomic hulk on the floor . But on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fear , came a sense of loss . Why had the fear been precious to me ? Was it that the fear itself defined me , and the challenge of the feared thing was my own chance to know myself real ? Why did I feel ridiculously diminished ? And suddenly , as I stood there , I was envious , in recollection , of that Negro who had long back escaped to Oberlin to show to a bevy of gaping , prissy , pious-tongued girls the scarce-healed cicatrice on his flesh where the terrible fangs of reality had slashed . Then , in recollection , I felt hatred for that Negro sitting under the lamp , exposing his precious arm . Who was he , ignorant , stupid , unwashed , wall-eyed , afraid ? In recollection I caught the sour smell of his rags . Who was he to be so grand because dog-bit ? You did n't have to be dog-bit to be free . I had about decided to get aboard a steamboat just at the moment of departure , risk getting a cabin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upriver but disembark at the first stop where the general movement of passengers ashore would give me some cover ,  |p125say  Vicksburg , and then , with the safe mask of my white face and gentility , make my way overland , north . The time came . Everything was working perfectly . I had money in my purse . I had pushed open the iron grill of Hamish Bond 's patio , for the last time , and gone out . The Pride of Cincinnati was to lift plank at four that afternoon , and already the black smoke of her stacks feathered high over the city . Since there was some apprehensionabout an outbreak of yellow fever , even this late in the season , in August , my last-minute appearance on the boat would not seem remarkable . Old Bronze John always encouraged sudden travel . I walked down the street , decorously under my parasol , and my heart beat strongly and calmly in my bosom . I would stop twice on the way to the levee , once to buy a valise of some sort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up two dresses I had ordered from the seamstress , and had left for this occasion , since clearly I could n't leave the house equipped for a journey . Now I was looking for some little colored boy who could be hired to carry my valise , once I had got it . Not that I could n't carry it , but the fact would have excited notice . I had to gamble on finding a boy , but that was an easy gamble on a summer afternoon , when any patch of shade might show a solitary specimen snoozing like a puppy , or a group huddled over a game of mumble-peg . I found my boy , struck a bargain for two coppers , and proceeded . All was well . All was well except for the one unpredictable thing . Years ago , if I had been asked what that unpredictable thing had turned out to be , I should have said that it was Rau-Ru  --  Rau-Ru suddenly there on the banquette . But now , if asked , I should reply , in candor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is always , in any calculation , the one factor unpredictable , the one thing unknowable : the self . That afternoon in August , after I had been to the seamstress , with the little colored boy trailing me with my valise , I proceeded toward the levee , whence rose , like the pillar of smoke for the wanderers of the Bible story , the smoke from the stacks of the Pride of Cincinnati . I was walking fast  --  I had to restrain myself to keep from running , excitement mounting in my breast now  --  and once , fearful that I had outpaced my little attendant and valise , I looked back . There he was , all right , dawdling a little , yes , but coming along on his short legs , the valise bumping in the neighborhood of his nigh shin . I saw the urchin , paused for an instant to let him catch up , andp126was about to call back , " Hurry , hurry ! " when I saw , some forty feet away , coming up the banquette on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wall there , a white-clad figure , but a figure vague because of my preoccupation . Then , on a stroke , it was not vague , there was the red sash , the flat straw hat like a sailor 's , there was the enameled black face , and the eyes were fixed , over the distance , directly into mine . And my heart was ice . Oh , how foolish I had been ! All this time lulled in my foolishness  --  deceived by money in my purse , the unlocked gate of the patio , my unaccompanied expeditions , the flop-pawed silliness of the dog , the indulgence of the master . All was a lie , for all the time eyes had been upon me . And I had the vision of Hamish Bond 's face , big there against the sky and the tiles of roofs and the colored stucco , the face with the indulgent smile wiped out , a cold and bulge-eyed brutishness . It was as though all my little stratagems had been enacted under his powerful , hair-sprigged , finger-maimed hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sardonic pleasure , it would drop , and I would be snatched back to whatever nightmare thing was in store for me . I stood there on the banquette , and the nightmare was coiling around me to blot out the sun-dazzle . Or to be sensible , it was merely the rush of blood to my head , the dizziness , the blacking of my vision . But it passed , and there was my last cunning of desperation . " Oh , Rau-Ru ! " I called . Promptly , the white-clad figure detached itself from the shadow of walls , the whiteness of the costume flashed to a new intensity in the blaze of sunlight , and Rau-Ru advanced toward me , opening his reserved smile to show the glinting whiteness of teeth , moving towardme in his inimitable cat-ease of stride , setting the glint of patent-leather boots punctiliously into the street-dust . He carried his hat in his hand . " M'selle , " he said . He yet stood below the level of the banquette , in the dust , and waited . This meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I. I looked , curiously , down into his face . I say curiously , but perhapsanother word would do better . I was finding something there in his face , and was bemused by it . Rather , I was finding something in the situation , merely in the fact that his face was a few inchesp127lower than mine . I was finding something in myself , a sense of power , and in my bemusement my apprehension fled away , my fear that I would not be able to brazen out the moment , that he would drag me disgracefully home . He said again : " M'selle . " That jerked me out of myself . " Rau-Ru , " I said , and heard the new authority in my tone , " this little nigger "  --  and I indicated the valiant little valise-toter  --  " this little nigger "  --  and I heard my voice give the delicate flick to the word , affirming what my deep need needed to affirm  --  " this little nigger is so plum lazy I 'll never get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bag , Rau-Ru ? " He looked at the boy , and the little fellow ducked his head a trifle as though to dodge a swipe , but kept his pop-eyed gaze canted warily sidewise and up , to assess the magnificent apparition of RauRu . Then Rau-Ru , wordlessly , put out his hand toward the boy . Slowly , in disgrace , the boy hung the handle of the valise on the outstretched forefinger of Rau-Ru 's hand , as though on a peg . He stood there , hope on the ebb in him , his eyes on me now , his small toes working a little on the board of the banquette . Pore little nigger , he just wanted his coppers . I reached into my purse , took a coin , and laid it in his palm . He looked down at it , a big , silver-shiny two-bit piece on the gray-pink of the palm . He could n't believe it . He lifted up his gaze to my face to read me . Then  --  so much like the cork of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Way up the street now , off the banquette , his heels flashed in their extending plume of dust . Without a word to Rau-Ru , I moved on , and turned left at the next corner , veering away from the direction of the levee . But I would n't head directly home . I was too clever for that . I took a wanderingand circuitous route , thinking that by this aimless peregrinationI should lull any suspicion which Rau-Ru , the spy , the master 's informer , might have had at finding me , in the first place , so far off the accustomed track . Then , with a sudden recollection of the moment when I had stood above him and looked down into his face , I thought : Who is he to question which way I choose to go ? What is he but another nigger carrying my valise ? And I walked up the street , never looking back but bearing in my mind the hard gratification of that image of the white-clad figure cat-stepping behind me , at the humble distance.  |p128When  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big dog stirred by the orange tree , then dropped his head . I saw the vines ruffling grayish on the balcony of my own room , high up . I entered the house , and Rau-Ru followed obediently . " You can set it down , " I said to him , and he put down the valise . " Thank you , " I said . " A votre service , " he said , and disappeared down the hall . Dollie , previously undetected , regarded me from the shadow of the stairs . " What are you looking at ? " I demanded sharply of her . " You , " she said , " you . Next thing you be gittin Ole Man Bond a-totin atter you . " And she moved across the hall , carrying in one hand an imaginary valise , moving in a swaying , comic burlesque of Rau-Ru 's not-to-beimitatedstride . When I first got up to my room , after the fiasco , all seemed void . I lay on the bed and saw the sky , beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a purple flecked and veined with a sulphurous light . Then I closed my eyes and heard the wind in my vines . But this blackness began to fill out again , not clearly , just with the faintest shadows of new hopes , new plans . Well , I had faced down Rau-Ru . There was no proof that I had tried to flee . Just the suspicion . I would face down Old Bond , too . I would face him down . I would make him withdraw his spies . I did n't know how I would do it , but I knew I could . With a sudden sense of power , I rose from the bed . I carefully prepared my toilet . I put on the most beautiful of my dresses , the one Old Bond liked best , too  --  the pink with the chocolate slashing in the skirt . Then I went down to dinner . I gave my master a most cold good evening . When he tried to make conversation I did not even look at him , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant monosyllable , while he lunged and blundered on , like a man trying to get through a thicket on a dark night . Finally , he fell silent . He stopped right in the middle of some sentence , just stopped . I knew he was looking at me . Then he said : " Pore little Manty , what 's the matter ? " " Nothing , " I said , shortly.  | " But something is the matter , " he said . And added : " I do n't want anything to be the matter , Manty . " " Well , " I said , feeling the flush of the moment , " in that case do n't set your spies on me . Do you hear ? Just lock my door and be done , will you ? " I rose from the table , stared straight into his stunned face , intoxicatedwith victory . " And further , " I said , " in the future I shall dine with your other  --  your other slaves  --  " and ran toward the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mincing , grimacing parody of servility , " Massa . " Then I fled up the stairs , to my room , and flung myself across the foot of the bed . I had carefully refrained from locking my door . I expected him to follow . Well , when he did , I would finish it off . I did n't know how , but I was sure . And he came . After a little , up from the hall , up the stairs , two flights , the stick making its regular sound . He knocked on my door . " Come in , " I called , and plunged my head deeper into the coverlet in an excess of despair . He came to stand at the foot of the bed . I heard the stick , then his breathing . " Are you sick , Manty ? " he asked , then . " No , " I said . " You got a fever , Manty ? " " I have n't got a fever , " I said . He picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't ! " I cried , and sat up , and jerked away from him . " Do n't you ever touch me ! " " But , Manty  --  " and he was staring at me in grievous confusion . " Do n't but me any buts , " I said , " after what you 've done . " And I plunged on : " After you 've set your spies on me , after you 've set that  --  that fancy nigger of yours to following me ! " " But , Manty  --  " he repeated , and took a step to come around the bed toward me , and stumbled on something , and might have fallen had he not grasped the bedpost . Then he leaned to remove the offendingobject , and I knew immediately what it was . It was my new valise . I suppose one valise more or less meant nothing to Hamish Bond , who in a way always seemed oblivious to the objects around him , that is , to objects with which he was not immediately dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it to one side without a thought . But when he picked it up , I assumed  --  wrongly I am certain  --  that I was now fully discovered . So I burst out : " All right , there it is . Yes , there is the valise . Yes , I was running away . " I plunged on , in a rapturous abandon , a savage glee that grew as I watched distress grow on his face . " Yes , I was getting on the steamboat , and if it had n't been for that Rau-Ru of yours  --  but he made me come back here  --  and oh ! I 'll die . " I stopped , breathless , trying to know , in a way , the meaning of what I had said . " Manty , " Hamish Bond was saying , and all at once the defenselessnessof his face stirred a last cold , calculating anger in me . " I wish , " I said quite coldly , quite calmly , " I wish that I had been taken to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you under-stand ? " Then , as I watched his face , an unpremeditated cry sprang to my lips . " Oh , why did you bring me here ? " I cried . Whatever confusion and distress had been struggling on Hamish Bond 's face , were then , on the stroke , gone . There was nothing in his face now , the emptiness of shock . Then his eyes blinked once or twice , slowly , as though he were reorienting himself in consciousness . I saw his tongue tip come out and wet his lips , as though in preparation for speech . But he said nothing . Then he managed the words : " Why  --  " he slowly repeated the question , " why did I do it ? " He shook his head almost imperceptibly , as though some small insectwere annoying him . Then he said : " I just do n't know . I just do n't know , Manty . " " Do n't call me Manty , " I snapped at him . But he ignored that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , setting the ferrule of the blackthorn to the bare floor . He leaned on his stick and stared heavily back at me . " A man lives a long time , " he said , " and it looks like there 's always something else he do n't know  --  " He did n't finish the sentence . Over there at the edge of the light I could see the faint gleam of the candle flame in his eyes . He twitched his head , a couple of times . Then he spoke with his strong , accustomed voice . " Listen , " he said , " you do n't have to stay here if you do n't want to . I am sending you away . " " Yes , " I retorted sarcastically , " selling me . I hope you get back your two thousand dollars . "  |p131But  he had lifted his stick to cut me short , and said : " There is a steamboat tomorrow to Cincinnati , The Golden Fleece . You 'll be on it . I have a business correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will arrange for  --  " He stopped . Then : " There 's no use to discuss it now . Everything will be arranged for you . " He pointed with his stick over to my valise , where he had dropped it . He grinned at me with a certain wryness  --  at least that was the expression as well as I could make out over there in the shadow . " And I reckon you 'll need more luggage than that , " he said . Then he went out , and down the hall . So that was the way it would end , I thought , and felt nothing but a drained lassitude . So that was the way : they would put you on a boat , and all day you would see the water slide beneath you , slick as oil , and you would lie in your berth and hear the engines heave and clump all night , and then , at the end of a certain time , you would be free . The wind had stopped just before I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenness of the silence had been palpable , filling the night , and in that silence I had slept . I had left a candle burning , under its hurricane glass , just because I was too lazy to get up and blow it out . What woke me , I do n't know . Perhaps the first stroke of wind on the house . Anyway , I was , all at once , awake , and in the maniacal middle of that preposterous tropical racket , I could identify nothing , not time nor place nor self . In that first instant , the candle was still burning , but the flame , even under the hurricane glass , was dancing in a vertiginous blur of light and shadow . Then the candleholder itself , globe and all , lifted and went crashing against the wall , and in the first smack of darkness of that identifiable event , I knew where , and what , I was . Somewhere a chimney or something , something big , fell horrendously . A voice somewhere was screaming , a woman 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment I had no notion what  --  ended flight in a crash on my balcony , like a massive destruction of crockery . The wind uttered perpetually a sound like a million cats in the rut-yowl . The lightning was probing the city with great jags and thrusts , probing for me , grabbing for me in the disorder of the city like a hand grabbing for something in a box of straw . A sudden gust drenched me , even there on the bed.  |p132I  leaped from the bed and tried to shove one wing of the window shut . I stood there shoving against the wind , and the wind was nearly snatching me naked . I heaved my weight against the frame . An upper pane of glass blew out . It shattered in all directions . I must have screamed , but I am sure that the scream was not audible , for on the same instant lightning struck a chimney across the street . I saw the ragged blaze of the bolt , and felt the rolling wash of the concussion . Then I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain was lashing me to the bone . What I next knew was hands on me , big hands dragging me from the window into the lee of the wall , picking me up , and I opened my eyes to catch , in a flash of lightning , the face of Hamish Bond leaningover , his soaked hair whipped down over his brow , his face running with rain , glistening in the lightning flash , his mouth sayingsomething , something not audible in the competing din . Then it was dark  --  or had I simply closed my eyes ?  --  and it was n't now , it was years back and I was out in the storm , out in the dark , lost , where I had gone to save poor Bu-Bula , poor Bu-Bula , the doll Old Shaddy had made me , and the thunder was scaring me to death , and I clutched the thin-soaked fabric of the shirt that stuck to Hamish Bond 's chest , clinging there , quivering in his arms , my eyes squinched shut , pressing my face into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the storm fell away . Abruptly , there was nothing but silence , then the sound of a voice calling off yonder in the street , in the dark , a voice sounding sweet and silvery in the silence as though cleansed by the rain , then the silence again . I was aware , then , of the small , raw sound of Hamish Bond 's breathing . He had been leaning back against the wall while the storm subsided , propping himself that way . All at once now he straightened , thrusting forward by a heave of the shoulder against the wall . Burdenedwith me , he did not have his stick . With my eyes yet shut I could feel how he swung his stiff right leg forward , balancing me for the effort . It was a kind of hobbling stride , but good enough , and somewhere back in my head there was the detached thought : He walks pretty well . That thought was lying there in my head like something scribbled on a scrap of paper and flung down in a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the bed and depositedp133me there . Then I surmised , my eyes still shut , that he had stepped back from the bed . For a moment there was no sound . Then some kind of a small sound , then another , a small plop . And I knew what that second sound was . I knew perfectly well . It was the sound of a soaked cloth being dropped to the floor . I felt the solid sag of the bed as his good knee came down on the edge . The voice said : " Oh , Manty ! " and the sound was more like a hollow groan being wrenched out of a man than like a word . The hand was then laid to my side to grasp it , at the small part . I remember with perfect distinctness , even now , the rasping textureof the skin of the ball of the thumb as it indented , though gently , my flesh . It was as coarse as sandpaper.  |p134YOU  LIVE THROUGH TIME , THAT LITTLE PIECE OF TIME THAT IS YOURS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life , it is the summing-up of all the other lives that are simultaneous with yours . It is , in other words , History , and what you are is an expression of History , and you do not live your life , but somehow , your life lives you , and you are , therefore , only what History does to you . That is what I have heard said , but we have to try to make sense of what we have lived , or what has lived us , and there are so many questions that cry for an answer , as children gather about your knee and cry for a sweetmeat . No , it would be better to change the comparison and say it is like children gathering about your knee to cry for a story , a bedtime story , and if you can tell the right story , then these children , then these questions , will sleep , and you can , too . You feel that if you can answer the questions , you might be free . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you know how you yourself , all the confused privatenesses of you , are involved with that history you are living through ? A young girl , storm-drenched and storm-scared and lonely and confused in a foreshortening of time , is disposed on a bed by an aging man , who utters her name like a groan , and gently and bloodilydoes that thing to her , and she cries out . I had almost used thatp135foul word that old Mr. Marmaduke , back in Kentucky , had used in his prediction of my fate . I would have used it in some impulse to spit upon and spurn that aging man and the young girl coupled on that bed , but something forbids . I would not spit upon them , after all , I suppose . Well , the young girl is adjusted upon the bed , but how is what happens to her connected with some late conversation of bankers that same night in New York City , wreathed in the spicy smoke of cigars and eye-glittering with French brandy , or connected with the sweat-cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with a grim-jawed old man , seated by the candle in a farmhouse in Maryland , not far from Harper 's Ferry , who lifts his eyes from the Holy Writ and moves his lips stiffly in prayer , pantingfor the moment when the old blood-drenched fantasy will whirl again before his eyes and justify all ? Oh , who is whose victim ? And the hand of Hamish Bond laid to my side , and the spreading creep and prickle of sensation across the softness of my belly from the focus of Hamish Bond 's sandpaper thumb , and the unplaiting and deliquescence of the deep muscles of thighs were as much History as any death-cry at the trench-lip or in the tangle of the abatis . I woke not knowing , in the first flash , where I was , or what had happened , surprised by the contact of that unidentified bulk by me . Then , with the stir of memory , a flash of terror , a sense of violation , came , as though hours late I experienced , feebly but dutifully , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , in the moment of the terror , I had pulled myself free and was standing by the bed looking quickly about the room with distraction , at the broken window , the burst of early sunlight , the heap of Hamish Bond 's clothing on the floor with the spreading circleof wet , the big body on the bed . He was still asleep . He lay on one side , the face turned toward me , away from the window , the big head thrust hard against the pillow as by an effort , the bare right arm , from beneath which I had just escaped , flung heavily out . The sheet was twisted back so that , from heel to a point halfway between knee and hip , the leg was exposed . I looked at the big , hairy bare leg , with , I suppose , some remaining flicker of my terror , and I saw the scar.  |p136There  was a jagged , deep , purplish scar that ran from well up the thigh down to the knee , and across under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My terror was gone . I do not know what I felt as I gazed at it . But I do know that I suddenly leaned over and kissed the scar , and as I did so , my heart was flooded with tenderness . What I mean to say is that , according to my recollection , it was not the tenderness that made me lean to kiss the old wound . The tenderness came after I had leaned . But what made me lean ? I had lain back down , on the very edge of the bed , facing away from the bulk there , making not the slightest sound , and as I lay there I tried to decide how everything in the world was different now , but in a strange way nothing was different , nothing  --  that is , if I did not turn over , or if I just shut my eyes , and my mind . And as I was puzzling this , I went to sleep . When I woke up , Hamish Bond was gone . He came back late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed me the most formal greeting . I do n't know what I had expected , and I suppose I stood there , hearing the approach , balanced in a tremulous plasticity of spirit , ready to be defined by the first word spoken , the first fleeting expression on his face . But his face expressed nothing . If anything it was stony and remote , not the face I had come to know in late months . And after that formal greeting , he said : " I have told Michele to pack your things . The Golden Fleece leaves at three . " While he was saying those words , I could not believe them . Certainlyhe had promised me freedom , but the deed done had seemed to my mind , in so far as I had thought about it at all , to revoke all . Or if I was free , it was in a different way  --  what way I could n't say . But he was continuing : "  --  in Cincinnati in five days or so . I have arranged all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I thanked him . At the appointed hour I walked up the gangplank of The Golden Fleece , to the accompaniment of the festive racket . But I was not alone . Hamish Bond walked by my side . He was , he said , going up to Pointe du Loup . The trip to Pointe du Loup was short  --  an hour , two , three , I do not know . We stood side by side on the boiler deck , leaning on the starboard rail , apart from the movement of people , and watched thep137city drift away , the roofs , the great Cotton Press structure , the spire of the Cathedral , the gold cross . Then we watched the western shore slide past , levee , open bank , levee again , forests , clearings , the rare shack on bare ground , the rare great house , in a grove , on a hillock , the sun westering beyond , all objects flat , and two-dimensional , as that light beyond defined them . The river was at low water . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected to our gaze , the long , ever-renewed undulation that angled back from our bows moved unweariedly forward to define , as with an index finger , the demarcation of mud and old slime exposed at the base of the levee or the margin of shore . We did not talk during the journey . Now and then I stole a look at Hamish Bond 's face . It told me nothing . I can see quite clearly that face as it was at that moment : the square jaw , the short but broad nose set between the massive cheekbones , the fixed and bulge-eyed gaze over the water to distance . Toward dusk there was a jangle of bells . The craft lost headway , yawed in . Ahead , backed by forest visible over the low levee , I saw some sort of landing stage . At that moment the whistle let off a blast . In the stunned interlude , Hamish Bond turned to me and seemed about to speak . In the first silence , he said : " Well , this is it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great sloshing and pother as the paddle wheel on our side reversed . " Captain Simmons is fully instructed , " Hamish Bond was saying . " He will take care of you . " A colored boy appeared behind Harnish Bond , carrying his valise , and stood waiting . The plank was rattling down . Hamish Bond moved toward the head of the stairs to the main deck , I by his side . There he stopped , and reached into an inner pocket . He withdrew a big thick brown envelope . " Here , " he said , " here is everything you 'll need . The papers , and money . And Mr. Carton will attend you in Cincinnati . " He thrust the envelope at me . I took it . He stepped down one stair , as though on his way from me , then turned . Very formally , while I stood there in my numbness , he lifted my hand and kissed it . " Good-bye , " he said , " good-bye , little Manty . " He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People passed on the stair.  |p138All  at once , he had swung back to me . " Listen , " he said , in a constricted , grinding voice , like gravel under a boot-heel . I could not be sure what was on the face that stared up at me , anguish or ferocity . " Listen , " he said , in that grinding voice , " forget everything . Everythingthat 's ever happened . Forget me . " He went down the stairs with surprising rapidity , one hand on the rail , the other grasping the blackthorn , thumping his way down . I stood motionless , clutching the envelope . Then I realized that he had passed beyond my range of vision , was somewhere down there , moving away . I was not responsible for what was to happen . At least . I had made no decision for the act ; it surprised me . I found myself , still clutchingthe envelope , dashing down the stairs . Hamish Bond was almostat the end of the gangplank before I overtook him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared down at me . On his face was not surprise , nor incredulity , but a kind of bemusement , and a look of distance . For a moment , I felt myself lost in that distance . Then I knew that I must have been smiling at Hamish Bond , but with some kind of shy , tremulous appeal . He still looked down at me from his distance . Then , all at once , his face lighted in that strange way that , as I have already said , reminded me of sunlight breaking through cloud on a craggy landscape . " Well , Manty , " he said , grinning , " well , I 'll be darn . " He turned to the colored boy who had followed with the valise . " Boy , " he commanded , " get me all that stuff from Number Seven . " The boy dropped the valise and started off . " Hump it , boy ! " Hamish Bond said . We watched the steamboat gliding away , North , silent now in the distance , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in shadow of the forest , for the sun was low , but the smoke steady in the high , late light . We stood there in the wilderness , our feet on the sun-cracked mud of the old track , the incongruous luggage at our feet . Beyond the levee rose the forest , darkening now . A bird , far off there , called with a compulsive , irascible lament , musical by distance . I stepped closer to Hamish Bond . I wanted to take his hand , I suddenly felt so lost . But I only said : " What is that bird ? "  |p139He  turned to the forest , listening studiously . " I do n't know , " he said . Then he looked into my face . " Pore little Manty , " he said , and took my hand . And after a moment , still looking into my face : " We 're just what we are , little Manty . That 's all we are . " We stood there a little while , then he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get word ahead , they hear the boat blow for a landing , and know it 's me . " Just then , up the levee , broke a shrill yelp . A little colored boy was up there , at the head of the track . He was dancing up there , a fantastic flickering of heels and a bird-darting and bird-swooping of hands , all against the pink sky . We walked up the track and saw them all , coming . Some eighty or ninety Negroes were there , various sizes , ages and conditions . When we came over the levee , they yelled and clapped hands and patted their feet , yelling , " Massa , Massa  --  Massa , highjuba . " In the midst of them was a light wagon , two mules hitched to it , some bent poles arching over it , the bent poles festooned with flowers and bright rags , and under the bent poles , under the gaiety of flowers and rags , a split-bottom chair . An old Negro , some sort of headman , appeared and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring me for all his curiosity . But meanwhile all the other eyes were full on me . Hamish Bond looked slowly around , then back at me . " This , " he said , making a gesture toward me , " is  --  is Miss Manty . She will be here . She will do good to you . " There was a burst of appreciative racket , clapping and stamping ; " Do good  --  shore good  --  ever do good and high-juba ! " We were lifted into the wagon . Hamish Bond indicated the chair for me , under the garlands , and stood behind , holding the back . Our luggage was flung in . We started off . There was no driver . The nigh mule was led by the old boss-Negro . We rolled and bumped over the rotting relic of a corduroy road , the blossoms and bright rags waggling over our heads . Despite the late season , some water yet stood on each side of the track , and the great roots of cypresses jagged and convolved man-high from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old moss like a palpabledarkness . The split-bottom chair jounced , and the cortege danced , clapped , and stamped about our triumphal car , chanting :  | 4 0Massa , Massa , ole Mass ' , he come , Mass ' bring good thing , gon na gim me some , Massa done come , I ai n't never gon na cry , Gon na be hello now and never good-bye . Massa  --  Massa -- Massa , high-tuba ! Or something like that , and the old boss-Negro made up new words and called them out , to be picked up for the chant , for our adulation . Then we were out of the darkening trees , into wide fields where sky opened enormously with the last pale light . The wheels rolled silklike now on a loamy track . On each side , the cotton plants stretched away . The bolls were opening their snatches of snowy whiteness , bright even in the failing light . Ahead of us , rising from the flatness , on a low knoll or mound , stood a massy grove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those live oaks . But it was n't going to be great at all , certainly nothing to brag on . Many a plain man around Danville , back in Kentucky , had a house as good . It was n't even two-story , just a wooden house with a gallery , set high on a brick foundation . On the rear end , however , it was , as I discovered , two-story , for back there , on the lower brick level , were the winter kitchen , the dining room , and some storage . The wooden part of the house was n't even painted . As we drew up to the high steps of the house , all the rout of us , I saw , even in the darkness under the spreading live oaks , that the ground was grassless , as though trodden hard . They lifted Hamish Bond down , then me , chair and all . After supper that night  --  a supper of rice and soup and leathery cold venison and bowls of tepid milk  --  served on a great rosewood table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rarity among furnishings largely knocked together on the spot with hammer and nails and a predilection for the crooked line  --  we sat on the gallery between two smudge pots and viewed the evening . We could hear some sort of jubilation down at the quarters . There had been an issue of rum , earlier . I said : " When you come home  --  come up here , I mean  --  " " Yeah , home , " he said . " It is more like a home , up here . " " What I mean , " I continued , " is do they always do like this ? Turn out and have flowers and dance and sing ? "  | " Listen , " he said , " they always like Massa on every plantation . It 's the overseer that 's always a hellion , and the Massa is going to come and fix everything up nice . He does a little something in that line , if he 's smart , and they think he is wonderful . " " Have you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Then they come out for you ? " " Sometimes , if I been away a long time , " he said , " and it 's a slack season . Like now , corn laid by , cotton-picking barely on . Anyway , they like excuse for a jubilation . " After a moment , over there in the dark , he rose from his chair , with a heavy , lumbering motion , something like a heavy animal heaving up in the brush . He took a step or two . Then he tapped the gallery floor a few times with his stick . " The mound under this house , " he said , " it 's Indians built it . God knows when or how , but they 're lying down there in it , in the ground . " He took another step , tapping : " Yeah , and now we got nig  --  " Then he stopped , and I knew he had been going to say niggers , and I knew why he had stopped on the word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Niggers . " After a moment , then , he repeated : " Yeah , and now we got niggerson top of the Indians . And "  --  he hesitated  --  " and I 'm on top of the niggers . " I heard the far-off jubilation in the quarters . And I thought of the dancing , shouting rout around the wagon , moving through forest and field , and myself sitting under the waggling garlands and bright rags . Pointe du Loup was the smaller of Hamish Bond 's two upriver holdings . The other , a few horseback miles to the north , called Tarnation , was some z000 acres , not all under plow but with a force of z5o people . There had been a fine house there when Hamish Bond bought the place , but he had never occupied it . The house had later burned , and now there was only a cottage for the overseer . Hamish Bond went to Tarnation only often enough to keep an eye on things . He referred to the place contemptuously as a " cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , however , some deep attachment for Pointe du Loup , an attachment that I never fully understood , but that had some basis in the very roughness and isolation of the life there . " Home , " he called the place.  |p142Certainly  , when he was there he gave special attention to every detail , riding around in a light , high-wheeled gig to investigate and supervise whatever was going on  --  chopping , picking , ginning , cornpulling , farrier work , and ditching and drainage and tree-felling to win land from the swamp woods . Often I rode with him and heard his long monologues about his concerns , almost his talking to himself . Just talking to himself , he would say apologetically , and say it came from having been alone so much . " Off at sea , " he would say . And once went on to say how at sea a man gets so that he has to put his words out in the air and hear them to be sure he 's real , to be sure he " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk along , and I would listen and ask questions now and then , and feel good when he said : " Be damn , Manty , if you ai n't getting to be a better farmer than me . " Then he 'd laugh and say he reckoned he was n't a farmer at all , just stumbled into it , he was a sailor . And he might start talking about the China Sea , or Macao , or Zanzibar , or some other place he 'd been . We would ride along in the gig , under the beating sun , him sweatingin his black coat , his game leg stuck out stiffly and a little askew , me with my patent-leather shoes set primly side by side on the curvingfloor boards , me wearing a dimity dress , carrying a little parasol , and I would look across the distance of white cotton and sun-dazzle to the dark forest and hear the strangeness of his voice saying the names of places away across the world . That is one of the pictures that come back to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of me at evening , on the gallery , me quiet in the crook of his arm . Another is me down at the infirmary , at night , by candlelight , leaning over one of the cots where somebody lies , and Hamish Bond in the shadow , waiting , and Rau-Ru leaning and saying , " Have to cut it off  --  gon na have to , " and the terrible wideness of the gaze up from the cot to me , and how bulging white the eye-whites were in the black face down there . And then , after the stunning dosage of laudanum and rum , the man was strapped to the table , the tourniquet applied , and Rau-Ru cut off the mangled and gangrenous arm , knife and saw , just above the elbow , slapped on the white-hot iron to cauterize , and stepped back , looming in the candlelight , sweat glittering on the black enamel of his face , blood streaking the white blouse , the terrible , woodenhandlediron dangling from his grasp , the glow now fading from the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the man ,  |p143and  he might have been the warrior with falchion in hand , pausing in the carnage , or the torturer rapt before his achievement . He was not warrior , nor torturer , and he had done what had to be done . The gangrene would n't wait . I had stood beside Hamish Bond , gripping his arm , shaking like a child , but he had patted my hand , and I had managed to stand there , sustained in some pride . After it was over , we went outside , leaving the patient unconscious , and stood a moment , while HamishBond lighted a cheroot . He took a few puffs in silence , exhaling slowly . Then said : " Well , there goes a thousand dollars . " And I thought : And the price for me was two thousand dollars . And my hand on his arm must have started in surprise . He swung to me , and seemed to be peering down at me in the dark , over the small glow of the cheroot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , glumly . The reason I had stayed for the operation was that I had taken the infirmary as my special province and obligation  --  an echo , I suppose , of Hamish Bond 's words when he had introduced me to the people : " She will do good to you . " The infirmary itself was a wooden building , on the knoll for coolness , a long narrow structure divided into four sections , one for men , one for children , one for women with diseases , and one for women lying in . Two handy old beldames , full of lore , sleights of the flesh , prayerfulness , and garrulity , served as nurses at need , but before my time , the head-Galen and boss-empiric had been Rau-Ru . There is no sneer in my reference , except the sneer at my own small pretensions . As for Rau-Ru , he knew all the lore of the beldames , but had sorted out the true from the false . He knew that the emulsion of alder bark benefits a wound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , and that the decoction of lifeeverlastingbrings ease to the flesh . But beyond his roots and juices he had a locked-up cabinet of medicaments from New Orleans , and a big , red-backed book , The Planter 's Guide to Medicine and Surgery . He read that book like a breviary . I once asked Hamish Bond how Rau-Ru had learned to read . He said he had taught him . I asked if it was n't against the law , as I had been told at Oberlin.  | " Not where I was , " Hamish Bond replied . " I made what law there was . " " Where was that ? " I asked . He looked at me for a moment , a little dour , then said , shortly : " On my ship . " But Rau-Ru was more than boss-empiric . For all practical purposeshe was the overseer of Pointe du Loup . There was a white overseer at Tarnation , but even in the protracted absences of HamishBond in New Orleans , the overseer seldom set foot on the domainof Rau-Ru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as a concession , I suppose , to common practice and prejudice . " Ole Man Bond 's free niggers , " certainly those of Pointe du Loup , nearly ran their own lives . True , corn and cotton had to be raised , but under that iron necessity the rule of life was theirs  --  theirs and Rau-Ru 's . Rau-Ru and the " old ones " were a council , but a council that would call the people together and hear them before making a decision . As for punishment , the same council served as a court , with all the people summoned for the investigation and verdict , and their moans , ejaculations , and murmurs , formed a chorus to the development of justice . And justice was easy . The lash had hung , stiffening in its thongs , unused , on the granary door , in plain sight , for five years . The most feared punishment , past things like short pork rations or banishment from the Saturday night juba-pat , was the " finger-pointing , " a kind of putting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be addressed to the culprit during the term of punishment , and at every encounter a pointed finger would accompany the wordlessstare . I have seen a strong man , famous for hunting and fishing , accustomed to loneliness in those pursuits , drop down on his knees in broad daylight , as though the pointed finger were a pistol that had delivered its slug , and cry out , " Oh , I love ' ee , I love ' ee monst'ous , oh , why doan you love me ? " Occasionally , a sufferer under " finger-pointing " would flee to the woods . But he always came back . He came back , I suppose , because in the very punishment there was a promise  --  the promise of the " raise-up , " the moment when , surrounded by all the tribe , under the glory of pine-knot flares , the old head-man would reach down and lift the crouching culprit , and everybody would clap hands and stamp earth and chant in the common joy of restoration.  |p145I  have seen it , and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears from some strange yearning despair and generous joy , tears from  --  shall I say ?  --  the recognition of truth . I was standing by Hamish , and in shame at my tears I averted my face from him . But not in time . He reached his hand to my face , and drew it back to him , staring into my wet eyes . " I reckon it 's just what everybody wants , " he said , " the raise-up . " Then he said : " And whatever raise-up I got , I guess it 's you gave it . " I do n't know how long had been required for him to develop his plantation system , nor do I know what opposition he had encountered . From him , and from Michele , came echoes of those earlier times , but the most positive one came that fall after my arrival at Pointe du Loup , from Mr. Jereboam Boyd , a planter down-river from us . He rode up unheralded , got down , swapped hand clasp and shoulder slap , accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and propped back on the gallery , his feet up and the glass in his hand . I did not , of course , sit with them , but stayed where I had been , in the shady hall to catch the least drift of breeze , and went on with my sewing . " Well , Hamish , " I heard the voice say in a tone of vindication , " I got something for you . " I heard a rustle and looked up to see a hand , all I could see of the guest , reach a folded newspaper toward Hamish . And the voice went on : " Yes , sir , Hamish , a battle going on at Harper 's Ferry , and that scoundrel from Kansas  --  that murdering John Brown  --  starting an insurrection down in Virginia , and  --  " Then Hamish 's voice : " But the paper , it does n't say there is an insurrection . The niggers did n't rise . " And the other voice , with its flicker of anger : " Yeah , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Brown 's , and  --  " And Ilamish , quietly : " And not mine , I reckon you mean to say . " The other : " Do n't go off half-cocked and get mad . I been too easygoing , too . You ask anybody arid they 'll give me the name of being the easiest-going man on his force in the parish . " Hamish : " Yes , I know . " The other : " And I know this . I 'm gon na quit being so damned easy-going . You and me both , we better . "  |p146Hamish  : " Nobody 's been whipped in five years on this place . And not in three at Tarnation . I have n't lost a run-off in five years . I make a bale an acre , and feed . " The other : " What the hell you aiming at , Hamish ? You aiming single-handed to set every nigger in Louisiana free ? " Hamish got up and stumped a step or two . " Listen , " he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's coming twenty years from now . Or one year . Nobody ever knows . And me  --  all I 'm doing is taking up a little slack . That 's all a man can do . About anything . Take up a little slack . " " Slack , hell , " the other voice said , " you talk about slack , and if there 's any more of this John Brown stuff , there 'll be war like nobody's business . There 'll be killing from here to Canada . Hogs 'll quit eating corn for corpses . I tell you , there 'll be  --  " But I heard no more . I had jabbed my needle into the cloth , and fled . I could not bear to hear more . Whatever the world was like , away off yonder  --  the slave under the lash , men bleeding from gunshotin Virginia  --  all that world was beyond Pointe du Loup . I could not bear to hear about it . I did not understand my own desperation . I ran out the back door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spied the infirmary . With a gasp of relief , I fled there . I sent the old nurse away . I told her to go rest . I washed the face of a cottonhandwho lay there with fever . I changed the swaddlings on a baby . I sat and fanned the flies from the listless mother . After a while , I felt better . When the rare visits broke our peace , visits from Mr. Boyd and one or two other neighboring planters , I always felt some deep disturbance . I heard their voices on the gallery , or from a farther room , speaking of the world , voices grim or petulant , angry or sardonic , and I fled , to some task , to a book , to the infirmary  --  as I had fled that first time . When Charles de Marigny Prieur-Denis made his first visit , it was the same . The creak of saddle leather , a cheery halloo in the sunny autumn afternoon , boots quick on the gallery steps , and I looked up from my seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected , a graceful silhouette against the brightness . " As quiet as the thistledown , " he was saying . " Mais c'est moi qui viens ! Et doucement ! " He laughed , and stepped toward me , and said , " Ah , my littlep147Manty , " and bowed with a hint of gay parody to brush my hand with his lips . He straightened up and inspected me . " And how does the country agree with little Manty ? " I flushed and managed to murmur that I did n't know . " But I know , " he said . " It agrees very well . A little plumper  --  oh , so little  --  " and he swept his glance down my person , letting it linger for the flicker of a second on a new fullness of my bosom . Then he demanded : " But old Hamish , where is he ? " And he threw his head back and filled the house with a halloo . " He 's not in , " I said . " He 's off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we 'll wait , you and I. " And he drew up a straight chair closer to me , an old hickory-bottom thing , and settled himself . " We 'll talk , " he announced . " You 'll tell me all about life in the coun-try . " I said there was nothing to tell . " Oh , there must be something , " he said . And toying with the edge of the cloth I was sewing , he added : " At least , there is time to think in the country . Tell me , Manty , what do you think about ? " What did I think about ? That question set off , like a pulled trigger , an alarm in me . I rose abruptly . I said I had something to do , I was sorry . He continued to grasp , between forefinger and thumb , the edge of the cloth I had been sewing , not letting me go , looking up at me , with a kind of careless confidence . But I was not regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into my own inward shadows , in that strange way that may come unexpectedly , even in broad daylight , from such slight provocation as his question : What did I think about ? Suddenly , I ceased to pull against the cloth . I let it fall into his hands , and said I had to go , I truly had to , and fled . But bit by bit , Prieur-Denis , who came often , sometimes for protractedvisits , ceased to disturb me as a voice of the world. , He becamepart of Pointe du Loup , part of the whole , but a part with pleasing variety . He found that I was reading an old battered book on botany I had found in the house , and he brought me a new , fine one from New Orleans , with colored plates , and then he walked with me by the swamp-edge to gather specimens for my girlish botanizing . He brought me romances and the poems of Hugo , which he declaimed grandly , and this was a pleasant change of diet fromp148Pointe du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry Clay and old copies of De Bow 's Review . He told me the plots of plays he had seen in Paris or New Orleans , and asked what I thought of the characters he described . One evening  --  it must have been in the early spring of 186o  --  Charles sat with Hamish and me . He had been riding that afternoon , putting his horse at an improvised jump on the flat below the mound , over and over , this to a gallery of little pickaninnies . Now , in the evening , he said : " Manty , can you ride a horse ? " I hesitated on my answer , why I did n't know . He continued : " I saw you watching this afternoon . " And with that I felt like a child detected in crime , for I had watched a long time from the grove , sure that I was unobserved . " I could teach you , " he said . " Then you could ride some with me . " With that I had a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starrwood and me on Pearlie , and I felt a yearning to be again on horseback , to feel free , to feel the surge and power , and the control of that power in the sway of the body and the light movement of fingers . I was about to come out of the recollection and say , yes , yes , I 'd love to ride , when I saw Hamish 's stiff leg thrust out on the floor , the leg that could never bend again to the stirrup . So I said nothing . But in a measured voice , Hamish was saying : " Yes , let her ride . It 'll be something for Manty to do . To break the dullness . " Charles left the next day , however , and I assumed that all was forgotten . Two months later he was back , back with the saddle , a fine lady 's saddle , habit and boots , beautiful boots . He had stolen a slipperfrom me , he said , for the measure . Now he took the slipper from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching , said : " Yes , let her ride . It 'll break the dullness . " I began my lessons with Charles . I let him begin from the beginning , how to mount , how to finger the rein , and gravely bumbled through it all , enjoying in secret the moment when he should suddenlyburst out , " But you learn so fast , Manty ! " But that slyness and vanity were n't the reason I could n't tell him that I knew something of horsemanship . How could I tell him of Starrwood ?  |p149For  Starrwood no longer existed , or existed only in a great bitterness , except for moments that trapped me , like the vision of myself on Pearlie , on the lawn . I could not bear to think of my father 's voice calling out : " Oh , that 's my brave little Manty ! " and then think of what he had done , how he had let me be seized for the debts of his pleasure , and sold away . Oh , I hated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell would be to admit that he had prized me as nothing , that I was nothing . But meanwhile I enjoyed my sly , self-flattering joke on Charles and relished his surprise and praise . We rode along the swamp-edge for my specimens . We galloped along the levee-top , for excitement . We explored the woods road , little better than a track , that led to the Boyd place . Sometimes Hamish came along in his gig , and most decorously we rode along beside him , and Charles made a great point , too condescending a point I thought , of talking to him . And then Hamish might say , " You all get along . I 've got some business . " And we would canter off . On one such occasion , after we had ridden off , I turned to look back , and saw Hamish sitting in his gig at the edge of the wide cottonland , the westering light over him . Charles looked back , too , followingmy gaze . " Pauvre vieux , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . " Do n't say that ! " I cried . He replied nothing . He was so beautiful and arrogant on his horse , smiling , seeming so much the confident master of all the world 's delight , so far beyond the accidents of fortune and fleshly frailty . I hated him , for a moment , for that smile . The life at Pointe du Loup moved on , month by month , unruffled . But it is strange how forces can gather under the surface of your own life and you do not even know they are there . But all the summer of 186o , up till the late February of 1861 , when the great change came at Pointe du Loup , forces were gathering , too , in the far-off world . It was the summer when Mr. Lincoln made his race for the Presidency . More than once , I saw Hamish fling the paper down , and heave from his chair with his blundering force , and stump about , chewing his cheroot to a pulp.  |p150Then  , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secede from the Union . " Fools , damned fools all , " Hamish said , with purpling face , and Mr. Boyd , who had just been made a delegate to the Louisiana Convention , said : " Look here , Hamish , you know I was a Whig for years . You know I was a Union man . You know I wanted to patch things up " " The nigger thing , " Hamish said with blurting ferocity , " I wish no nigger had ever been born ! " " Oh , it 's not just niggers , " Mr. Boyd said . " The Yankees will rule or ruin . They aim to bleed us till the light shines through like glass . And if it 's war  --  " " War is killing , " Hamish said . " Well , I 'll do my share , " Mr. Boyd said . " I do n't know what a man 's share is , " Hamish said . " Well , you 're not the kind to lay down and take something , HamishBond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Whatever the point was , for himself at least , he never said , and now and then the wrangles went on , on the gallery , by the fireside . And Louisiana voted out of the Union and twenty cannon fired a salute when the State flag ran up , and the Confederacy was formed , and Jefferson Davis was President , and Adelina Patti sang in New Orleans , and the Christy Minstrel Show was there , and races at the Jockey Club at Metairie , and the Mystic Krewe of Comus paraded for Mardi Gras , and to me , who had never seen such things , it was words printed in a newspaper , words , and the flash of distress in my bosom , the fear and guilt . I felt afraid of anything that might break the hypnotic and protectivepeace of Pointe du Loup . I felt guilty because I put my fear ahead of any prospect of freedom for all those black men in that land that stretched away in all directions beyond Pointe du Loup , places where this easy rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not admit to either the fear or the guilt . I could only suffer moments of a nameless misery , a tightening at the temples , a shadow on the soul . Charles talked of raising a company of cavalry , and laughed , and touched his mustache and whirled an imaginary sabre , while his eyes glittered . Then he went away , to the Carnival , with whatever picture of himself was in his head . He came back in two weeks.  |p151It  was the dead of night . I woke to the sound of dogs barking . Hamish was sitting up in bed , listening . Then I saw the topmost leaves of the live oak beyond the window picked out in a flicker of light . " Flares , " Hamish said , and got out of bed , and fumbled for his clothes . Before I could dress , he was gone . By the time I got outdoors , the locus of excitement was down at the stables , the voices and flares . I ran down there . There were near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , a couple of men holding flares , a little apart , and Hamish and Charles to one side . I stopped just outside the ring of light . The figures in the center were Negroes , eyes bulging white and rolling in the light of the flares , big awkward fellows , half crouching , near naked , breech-clout or ragged trousers , here and there some sacking tied about shoulders , elsewhere black , slick shoulders glisteningunder the flares , and on the left ankle of each  --  I thought it was that ankle  --  was an iron ring , and from ring to ring ran a chain . Some of them still stupidly held a lap of chain in the hand , as they must have had to do when marching . They held it the way a lady handles her train . Then the words of Hamish impinged upon me : "  --  and I do n't believeyour boat was leaking that bad . I think you would use me for a convenience . And I wo n't be made a convenience for your damned nigger-running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prinking gesture of a Papish priest at Mass , when he sprinkles , was smiling , saying , " Asperges me , Domine , hyssopo  --  oh , yes , you are sprinkled with hyssop now , but look here  --  " and he stopped smiling "  --  you do n't have to be afraid now , it 's all differentnow . There is no Yankee law now , and our law 'll be changed . " " That 's not the point , " Hamish broke in . " Law or no law , now or later , I will not run a barracoon for your convenience . " Suddenly , Rau-Ru rose up from beyond the clump of Negroes , where he must have been crouching , and made some gesture to his master . Hamish stopped in the middle of his sentence , and went to him and looked down . Then he turned abruptly to Charles . " You damned near got a dead nigger here , " he said , sourly . Charles shrugged . " There 's only one way for some to learn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'll do . I 'll buy the lot off you . Seven hundred a head , as they run . " " Seven hundred , " Charles said , and smiled ironically . " That 's all they 're worth , " Hamish said . " Ca n't talk English , got home-fever , not broke yet . " " Oh , yes , " Charles said , " your fancy nigger , yes , he can talk to ' em , he can break them . Yes , you 'd be making a good thing . " " Good thing be damned , " Hamish said . " I advise you to take my offer . And get on your way tomorrow . " He leaned down to the sick or hurt fellow , whom I could n't see , as though the matter were concluded . Rau-Ru leaned and gabbled something . Then Hamish said : " File him out and put him in the in-firmary . " I heard the click of metal on metal . Hamish looked up and beckonedone of the torches nearer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over there in the torchlight , I thought for a momentthat whatever rage had been suppressed in the dialogue with Charles would now burst out at me . But it did not . He only said , in a grinding voice : " What are you doing here ? Get to the house . " So I fled , and got to bed , trembling in something like fear , fear and lostness evoked by that unfamiliar voice . Later , much later , I heard Charles and Hamish on the steps of the gallery . Hamish 's voice rose : " Yes , I did use you . But you ca n't use me , not for this . Now go away tomorrow , for I do n't want to see you . " When Hamish came to bed , I pretended to be asleep . In the morning I lay abed . I did not want to see Charles . In the middle-morning , he took his departure , on the horse that r he had been leaving at Pointe du Loup . A little later , Hamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that he had to go to Tarnation , and would n't be back till the following day . He sat on the bed 's edge and held my hand , wordlessly . Then he rose , leaned over and kissed me , still wordless . I did not dress till noon . Michele came up and ate a silent meal with me . She would stay in the house with me during Hamish 's absence , as usual . After our gumbo and milk , she announced that she would go to the infirmary , but she made no reference to the new arrivals at Pointe du Loup.  |p153It  was mid-afternoon , when , in my listlessness , I heard steps on the gallery , and looked up . It was Charles . He said he had come back to see Hamish . Was Hamish in ? No , I said , but did not elaborate . He said that he had had a misunderstanding with Hamish and would wait . I told him that Hamish had gone to Tarnation , and he said that he might ride up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the same old hickorybottomhe had sat in the afternoon of his first visit sixteen months earlier . In fact , the whole episode began to assume the quality of a recollection , a re-enactment , a muffled recollection with strange distortions , a recollection that somehow fulfilled the event recollected . He sat there regarding me , saying nothing . Then he went to the cabinet at the end of the hall and poured himself a tumbler of brandy . He drank some , and refilled the glass . He came back to his seat , drank some more , and then asked if I would go riding with him . I refused . He began to toy with the edge of the cloth I was sewing , as on the afternoon so long before . He insisted that I go riding . Upon my curt refusal , he said , in French , yes , I was right , it might be better here . When I looked at him in question , he said , again in French , that what would come would have to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he seized my hand , and began to caress it . I attempted to withdraw it , but his clasp tightened like steel  --  he was very strong  --  and he twisted my wrist , just a little . " Listen , " he said , almost whispering . He whispered very slowly and distinctly , leaning at me , saying that he knew , and I knew , what would come , and the time had come . He rose , suddenly , and leaned over me . Maintenant ! he whispered . I jerked my hand from him , and rose . He again seized me , by the wrist this time , and said that Hamish Bond was nearly an old man , that I had never known what it was like , really like , and did n't I want to know ? I was struggling with him , and his whisper went on , saying I had never known , never really known . Then suddenly he said , quitep154coldly , in his usual voice : " Unless , of course , you have been behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fancy nigger of his ? " At that I uttered a little gasp of rage , and jerked from him with all my might . He forestalled me , pressed me back against his chest , and put a hand over my mouth . He held me that way very firmly , then said in the same distinct near-whisper : " Now , now , in just a second , I 'll take my hand off your mouth . And you wo n't scream . No , you wo n't scream at all , little Manty . Because you do n't really want to scream . No , that is n't what you want . " He was still for a moment , and I could feel his heart beating against my left shoulder , and I could n't breathe . Then he said : " Now , " in English , in quite a normal tone , and removed his hand from my mouth . I swear , I do n't know whether I screamed . It is very strange , but I simply do n't know . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , summonedby my scream , or coming in by accident , I was struggling violently  --  or immediately began to struggle  --  do I know which ?  --  and I cried out , " Rau-Ru ! Rau-Ru ! " most desperately . Rau-Ru seized Charles by the shoulder and jerked him back . He jerked him so hard that he whirled sidewise , lost his footing , fell , and grazed his temple against the sharp back of the hickory-bottom chair . He lay on the floor , stunned for an instant , with a little blood on his temple . He got to his feet , braced himself on the chair , and said : " You struck me . You struck a white man . You know the law . You know what that means . " Rau-Ru looked wildly at me . " Do n't look at her , " Charles said . " She may come to you behind the barn , but she ca n't help you now . Not against a white man . For she "  --  and he looked at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she 's a nigger , too . " All that time Rau-Ru was looking at Charles , wide-eyed and blank . There simply was n't a thing on his face . Then he struck him . I suppose Charles had taken that wide-eyed blankness for terror , and perhaps it was . I suppose that any man  --  even Rau-Ru  --  has a right to terror when he feels the world fade beneath his feet . Anyway , Charles must have read it as abject terror , and therefore was unprepared for defense . The blow was to the face . The victim did n't fall backward . Hep155seemed to hang in the air a moment , with a sad , reproachful look at Rau-Ru , and then slumped forward and rolled over . Rau-Ru stood there and looked down at the body on the floor . Then he looked at his hand , as at a very peculiar instrument the purpose and function of which he did not wholly comprehend . Meanwhile , I had screamed . I know that I screamed this time . Not once , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still standing there , Rau-Ru and I , when Michele came running in . She did not utter a word . She looked at me , at Rau-Ru , at RauRu'sguilty hand , which was hanging out from his body , at the body on the floor . Then she stooped and lifted the head of the fallen man . The neck seemed limp when she lifted the head . Her gaze , and the gaze of Rau-Ru , met . I burst out : " Hamish  --  he 'll come  --  it 'll be all right  --  " I think that Michele was shaking her head , ever so slightly , at Rau-Ru . " I 'll send for Hamish , " I babbled , " and he 'll  --  he 'll  --  " But Rau-Ru had turned , had moved out of the hall , to the gallery , with his rapid , silent , purposive stride . I ran out to the gallery . I called after him : " But it 'll be all right  --  it 'll be all right ! " He disappeared behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not stop there . Charles was not dead , though he remained unconscious for a full hour after we had got him to bed and applied compresses to his head . His pulse was extraordinarily feeble , feeble enough , I suppose , to have deceived Michele at her first investigation . There was a great deal of blood , too , from his nose , which was broken . Everything might still have been well . Hamish might have come , and browbeaten or blackmailed Charles into dropping the notion of law , and have got word to Rau-Ru . But it is strange how things developaccording to an inner logic , though the details of that logic seem to depend on mere accident and coincidence . I had sent off a rider to Tarnation to summon Hamish , but long before he could have arrived , while I huddled over the bed where Charles lay , I heard steps on the gallery . It was Mr. Boyd . It was plain bad luck that Mr. Boyd should come now , but even as I recognized his figure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . He had been mysteriously summoned , as it were , by the necessity of things , by a secret voice , by a dancing wisp that led him through the bud and bird-song of the spring afternoon . I saw him there , and even as he saw me and called out , I dashed into the room , to Michele . " It 's Mr. Boyd , " I managed , in my terror . " All right , " Michele said , and hurried around the bed , toward the door . But Charles was awake now , awake enough to grasp the situation . I saw his face in a spasm of effort . Then he yelled : " Boyd ! " Like a fool , I had left the door open . The yell had scarcely been uttered before Michele , outside , had shut the door . Charles ' gaze was on me with a glittering enmity . I could hear some sort of debate outside the door , then Mr. Boyd 's voice raised . Then the door flung open , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaned over the bed . " That fancy nigger  --  " Charles managed to say , " he tried  --  tried to kill me  --  and they  --  they all  --  " He must have been going to inculpate us all , in some way , and certainly Michele 's attempt to block entrance to the chamber had already inculpated us . Mr. Boyd did not wait for more . As the first words came out , I had seen the dawning intensity on his face , a sort of purity of joy . " Ah ! " he said , and snapped up from his leaning position over the bed . He strode to the door , then swung toward Michele . " I 'll send the doctor . You let him die now and it 'll be your neck . " Then he was charging down the hall , and was gone . I had to go and lie down , I felt so awful . It was late at night before Hamish arrived . Long before that we had heard a hullabaloo below the hummock , shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flares . " The Sheriff , " Michele said . The racket and torchlight disappeared toward the forest . The doctor was there when Hamish arrived . The patient , he said , would be all right . The doctor left and Hamish dispatched some messages in writing , one to Mr. Boyd , one to the Sheriff of the par/ish . Then he stumped up and down the hall , for hours , sometimes muttering to himself , now and then pausing to take a drink of brandy . He was not , ordinarily , a drinking man . Now and then I would come out into the hall and huddle on a chair , watching him . When he remembered me , he would come over and pat me on the shoulder , and once he kissed me on top of my head . I could not stay up long at a time , I felt so bad . I knew I had fever . But I did not tell Hamish how I felt . We got the news the next day . They had found Rau-Ru very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made no great effort to put distance between himself and Pointe du Loup . He might have taken a horse and gone miles . As it was , he must have waited , after all , for Hamish to arrive . " Thought he was always so durn smart , that nigger , " the deputy said , who brought the news . " But ai n't none of ' em smart . Did n't even have no gun , ner knife , ner nuthin , and him just nigh kilt a white man . Caught him lak catchin a rabbit . " But that was not quite the end of the story . At the lock-up in the settlement , Rau-Ru had made trouble , so they flogged him . But he broke his bonds and killed a man . This time they did not catch him . Hamish got the news just as he was getting into the gig to go to the settlement to see Rau-Ru . The next day Charles was up and moving about his room . We could hear him , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , Hamish asked Michele how Mr. Prieur-Denis was . She said he was about all right . Then Hamish did what he must have been building up to all that day and the day before , all the times he had been stumping back and forth before that closed door , all the times he had made me tell him , over and over , exactly what had happened , word for word , leaning at me with a scary and awful avidity . When Hamish entered the room I followed as far as the door . Charles was propped up on the bed , dressed . Hamish said nothing at first , and Charles ' eyes , over the bruised and swollen nose , followed him with a flickering wariness . Hamish stood over the foot of the bed . " How do you feel ? " he demanded.  |p158He  felt better , Charles replied , and thanked him with ironical politeness . " Can you stand up ? " Hamish asked . " Yes , " Charles said . " Well , " Hamish said , " you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to leave , " Charles said . " Lend me the gig , and I 'll leave right now . " " I 'm going to kill you first , " Hamish said and took a pistol out of his pocket . I let out a gasp , or cry of protest , and Hamish swung toward me . " Shut up ! " he commanded savagely . Meanwhile , Charles had n't turned a hair . " You 're a fool , " he said to Hamish . " This is n't the Coast . They 'll hang you here . " Hamish shook his head . " No , " he said , " I got it all worked out . It 'll be self-defense . Or "  --  he hesitated  --  " it 'll be a duel . A sort of duel . " He propped his blackthorn against the foot of the bed , and with the newly freed left hand produced another pistol , a mate . Charles ' eyes narrowed a little , quick on the pistol , then on Hamish'sface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel , " Hamish said . " You 've fought duels . Two . Killed one and crippled the other . You like a duel . You 've practiced all your life to be perfect . Fast and sure . " He paused and seemed to be brooding over something . Then : " Me , I 'm J not fast . But I 'll be very sure . " Charles seemed about to say something . But Hamish leaned forward a little , and said : " Yeah , you might clip me . Yeah , and that would look better when the Sheriff comes . Yes , Charles , you might hit me , but I 'll be propped against the wall , and I 'll take my time . Just one place you could hit me , Charles , to do you any good . Right between the eyes , Charles , but you wo n't risk that shot . You 'll lose your nerve , the target 's too little . And then you 'll try to tag my heart , and you 'll miss it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've known me a long time , Charles , and you know that when I reckon on doing a thing I do it , and you know I 'll be standing there long enough . And you 'll be sweating . " Suddenly , I-Iamish leaned forward a little more , and his voice sank . " How does it feel , Charles , " he whispered solicitously , " to be sweating right now ? "  |p159Then  he resumed , in his tone of patient explanation : " You see , Charles , I 'm telling you all about it so careful so you 'll start sweating now . So you 'll start twitching now . Yes , let me tell you how it 'll be after I kill you , how clean I got it all worked out . I got me a witness , even . " Charles ' gaze flicked to me . " No , " Hamish said , " not little Manty . I know what you said to her about why she could n't be legal witness . I reckon that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For saying that . But , no , I got me another witness , white . It 's my overseer 's grown son . Yes , I got him downstairs in the storeroom checking my supply book , right this minute , and he 's going to hear two shots , and run up here , and he 'll see me against the wall , and maybe I 'll be clipped a little , or the slug in the wall by me , but you  --  you 'll be on the floor , Charles , and you 'll be holding a pistol with smoke still in it , and your gut 'll be shot out . For that 's where I 'll give it to you , Charles , a nice big target , right in the bowels . I need a fair target , for I 'm not good like you . , " Give me that pistol , " Charles demanded , in a hoarse voice . Hamish shook his head , sadly . " Not yet , " he said . " I got to let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I 'm explaining so careful . Besides , Charles , I 've known you a long time , and a man do n't kill an old friend fast . It 's taken me fifteen years and I reckon I can wait a minute longer . To let the sweat and twitches build up . " " Give me that pistol , " Charles said . " I 'll tell you why they 're building up , " Hamish said . " Because the deepest thing in you is a coward , Charles . Oh , you would n't be a coward in a lot of ways . Not under the Chalmette Oaks at New Orleansand the seconds watching and the referee counting and all that . Oh , that 's grand , and is a picture in your head , and how grand you are . But not now , piled on the bed in a dirty bedroom and your nose is broke and a nigger broke it and that 's not pretty , and the sweats are building up . " " Give me that pistol , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let one foot to the floor , and reached out his hand . " Your hand , " Hamish said , " look at it . It 's twitching just a little bit . " Charles looked at his hand . " Yes , " Hamish said , with a detached , professional judgment , " just a little . But enough . So now I reckon we 'll start . "  |p160Abru|ptly  , he pointed the pistol in the right hand at the middle of Charles ' body . " Stand up , " he commanded . Charles got off the bed . " Listen , " Hamish said , " so you wo n't make any mistakes . I 'm goingto toss the other pistol on the bed . It 's not on cock . You pick it up and just take your shot any time you can . I 'm going to point at your gut all the time . And now I 'll just get back and prop against the wall , and count three . Then I 'll toss the pistol . " IIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot ? " Charles said . Hamish studied him . " But you wo n't refuse , " he said , finally . " You are n't that kind of a coward . You 're another kind , the kind that 'll be afraid not to shoot . Just like you 're afraid now to yell for Tom Simpkinsto come upstairs . You 're afraid of the look on his face when you had to tell him why you yelled . You see , Charles , you are n't a simple coward . You got the coward all mixed up with a lot of other things . That 's why being a coward hurts you so much . That 's why you been sick of yourself , way down in your gut , all your life . That 's why you 've felt trapped , just plain trapped , all your life . And now I 'm going to count , Charles " He made the second count . But that was all . I simply could n't stand it . I did n't even know what I could n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabbed both of Hamish 's hands , pistols and all , and pressed them against me  --  the sides , not the muzzles , I mean  --  so he could n't jerk them free . I clutched them so hard I felt the cocked hammer of the weapon in his right hand pressed against the underside of my right breast , just under the nipple , and I thought : If he should happen to pull the trigger , it would pinch me , it would pinch me horribly . But I kept hanging on to the pistols . " Turn loose ! " Hamish commanded . His face was flushed dark , he was so angry , but I would n't turn loose . " So you want to save that  --  " Hamish stopped and groped for the word of identification . " That man , " he finished lamely . I looked across at Charles , standing there by the bed , sweat on his brow , nose broken and swollen . " No , " I burst out , " no  --  it 's not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sob . " Listen , " Hamish said , " it 's up to him . I 'll just let him walk out the door and get in the gig and never come back . If he 's coward enough not to ask for that pistol . " He looked across at Charles for a long minute . " And I reckon he is , " he said . Then Hamish asked me to summon Tom Simpkins from downstairs , and Tom Simpkins , a big , rawboned , red-faced , and redheadedfellow of twenty-two or - three , with a shaggy cowlick , and a sly , hard , sidewise , animal glance , came in , and Hamish asked him politely if he could have the gig made ready and kindly drive Mr. Prieur-Denis over to the Boyd place . Mr. Prieur-Denis , Hamish explained , thought his health might improve faster away from Pointe du Loup . Tom Simpkins looked at Charles with his sidewise look , and did not grin , and said , yes , sir , he would . Charles was still sweating . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for his office . I lay down again , for a while . I still felt awful . We managed to eat some supper , a meal scorched and ruined , but it did n't matter . Later we sat on the gallery , silent for a long time , while a pale moonlight grew over the fields beyond the blackness of the grove . Leaning against his shoulder , I shivered a little . " Cold ? " he asked , and took my hands . " No , " I said , " I just shivered . " He was silent for a time , then said , heavily : " I reckon I did you a wrong , Manty . " I did n't say anything , but I remember that , even as I puzzled over what he meant and felt safe with my hands palm to palm inside his big hands , I knew deep inside me , maybe denied and separate from me , some hard , secret sense of advantage suddenly growing . Ah , why do people have to be like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it is n't the true you  --  always spying from the darkest , most secret corner of your heart ? But maybe it is the you , after all , and that thought is terrible . Or maybe this is true only of me . Maybe nobody else is like this , nobody but me.  |p162Would  there be some way to be different before I die ? But now that I recall that moment , I see that it is like another moment , years earlier , the time in Cincinnati , when my father , after he had failed to understand my attempt to save his soul and had , to boot , embarrassed me by the quarrel with the next table , came to my room in the hotel , and sat by my bed , and apologized to me . With his sad apology , I had felt that same hard , secret sense of advantagegained . But now I sat by Hamish on the gallery and felt it , and said nothing . Finally , Hamish spoke again . " Yes , I reckon I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see , " he said , " I reckon I knew all the time , way back , it would come out like it came . And I just let it come . " He fell silent , then resumed . " No , I sort of brought it on . " " Brought on what ? " I asked , but I suppose I knew already , and simply wanted him to say it , and confirm my sweet advantage of having been little and precious and wronged . With my question he heaved up from the seat , and stood there against the moonlight and stared down at me , his eyes glittering in the shadow , staring down at me with what I suddenly felt to be an accusation . And his words were like an accusation , a clairvoyant accusation . " Why do you ask me ? " he said . " You know what I 'm talking about . You know that I knew what he would do , sooner or later , and I let it come . " Then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it to come . " At that , at the thought that he had wanted the thing to happen to me , I felt some sort of excitement , a catch in the breath . " Listen , " he said , " a man young , growing up , he keeps trying his strength , trying it more and being proud of it . Then , all of a sudden  --  " He stopped , and I heard him take a breath . Then he went on : "  --  then he 's old . And he tries his weakness . He 's just sort of got to test it , and see . " This time , he waited a long time , standing there against the moonlight . " I guess I just had to know what you 'd do , " he said . Then : " And whatever you did , then I could kill him . No , I did n't plan it . I just sort of felt it in my bones . " He waited , then added : " Because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I just wanted to get him dead to rights . " Then : " And I got him dead to rights . " He paused grimly . " I gotp163him , " he said , " and then I did n't do anything . You asked me not to , and I did n't . But do you know why ? " I said nothing . " Well , it was n't because you asked me . No , it was just I could make him stand there and show you how he was empty , deep insidehimself . I 'd make the sweat come down his slick face , and you 'd see his insides . " Then : " Do you hate me , Manty ? " I did n't know what I felt . I guess I was afraid . I had known HamishBond for a long time , and I guess he had been nothing but a bulk , a voice , a protecting warmth in the darkness , a pressure on my body . He had not been real , just a dream I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling to . And now , all at once , something was beginning to come real . Something had been happening in that bulk , something I had never guessed , an uncoiling of possibilities in the inside dark of that bulk , and that was frightening . Oh , it 's always frightening when somebody comes real to you . But this was frightening in a special way . If Hamish Bond had been nothing but a dream I was having , this was like finding out , of a sudden , that I myself was nothing but a dream which he had been having , and had to have for his own need . So I was nothing , and alone in the middle of nothing . It was the feeling of that old nightmareof mine , of being in the middle of a desert and the horizon fleeing away in all directions . " Well , " he said , " I 'll tell you the worst . In a crazy way , I wanted you to do what you did n't do . " Then : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just there was something that wanted that , too . You see , " he continued , more quietly , " it was like how you want to know the worst that can happen , then you feel free . " I could hear his breath . " Oh , Manty , " he burst out , his voice like a groan , like that first time he had grasped me and called my name . " Oh , Manty , " he said now , crying out to me , " ai n't it awful a man can be this way ? " Without warning , my heart overflowed with tenderness , and I jumped up , seized Hamish 's hands , and began to kiss them . That tenderness , that pity or whatever it was , had caught me unawares . It was like the time I had seen poor Seth Parton standing in the Turpin parlor , in Oberlin , with the snow melting on his hair.  |p164After  I had drawn Hamish to sit again beside me , he said something else . " Free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . He began over again . " You know , " he said , " about everything I ever set out to do , I 've done . I got everything I ever set out to get . And you know , it was always just like something getting tighter and tighter around me . " And then : " I guess if a man finds his strength wo n't do him any good , he sort of thinks his weakness maybe will . " There is one more thing about the cowardice of Charles de MarignyPrieur-Denis . That afternoon he had stood there and sweated and been a coward . But the war came , and , as he had said , he raised a command of cavalry , and led it into battle . He was twice wounded , the second time seriously . But he returned to his command . He was killed in 1865 , on the way from Richmond . He was killed in what I think they call a holding action . It was to help cover the retreat of General Lee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry stayed to defend it till it got into motion again , some infantry and Charles ' command . The Yankees came up , and began to align for the attack . Charles charged them to prevent this , and was killed . I never learned whether it did any good or not . I do not know what this proves about Charles being a coward . Maybe Hamish Bond was right , and Charles was a coward because he could n't be brave those times when he did n't have the right picture of himself in his head . Maybe a cavalry charge was the right kind of picture , and he could act brave then . But maybe by 1865 too much had happened for him to have any more pictures of any kind in his head , and he was just left with the things you see out there in the world separate from yourself . Maybe that day he just looked over his shoulder , and saw the stalled wagons up the road , the skinny , hairy-faced , ragged men deployingin the old sage grass away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the old sage , and then he looked across the field and saw the Gatlings come up , and there was no picture at all in his head , and he just touched his left spur to the mount 's flank , and did what he did.  |p165Whatever  the case , I was glad when I heard about this . Whatever Charles was , I could not bear to leave him standing in that dingy bedroom at Pointe du Loup , the beautiful nose broken and ruined , with the sweat coming down his face , forever . It was the small things that began to go wrong at first . They were so small that you scarcely noticed them , like the scorched meal that night after Charles was sent away  --  small things like the broken dish , the tracked-in mud in the hall left on the floor , the tardiness when the horn blew for tumble-up time , the horses half-curried , the jollificationfading away early on Saturday night , the sudden silence after the singing and juba . Bigger things began to go wrong . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't even seem to care . Hamish was sure one of his horses was being run at night , off to God knew where and for what . The new hands bought from Charles did n't seem to learn anything , despite all Hamish could do . One of them died . He just lay on his back and kept looking up at the rafters of the infirmary and died . All the days he was dying , people kept sneaking up to the infirmary to look at him . They 'd just stare at him in a peculiar way by the hour , if you 'd let them . Hamish forbade any to come look at him , except the nurses . But they came anyway , to stare . They 'd come at night even , tired after a hard day 's work , like it was something they just had to do . Then he died . There did n't seem to be any particular reason for his dying . " Home fever , " Hamish said glumly . Then there was the awful fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise-up did n't do much good . So Hamish had a whipping . He made the whole lot come together on Saturday night and watch it , and he stood by . Lying on the bed , in the house , I could hear the yells . I counted them . There were twenty yells . Hamish came back to the house and drank some brandy . When we went to bed I took his hand and snuggled against him , because I felt so lonesome , but he almost shoved me away . He was lying on his back , staring up at the ceiling . In early April there was the shot from the swamp woods . Hamish was riding in the gig , and the bullet made a hole in the seat-back , right beside him . He said he did n't have any idea who it would be . But I was sure it was Rau-Ru , come back.  | " No , " he said , and shook his head , " a smart one like him , he 's long-gone North . " That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture , Rau-Ru 's face surrounded by new green leaves , the face glinting like black enamel in the sun-dapple that fell through the leaves , the face peering out of the forest leaves , across the cotton fields , where a black-coated figure slowly approaches , over the bright distance , in a gig . Just after word of Fort Sumter , we left Pointe du Loup . I do n't know whether it was because of Sumter , or because Hamish just gave up . He got in a regular overseer , a man very quiet in the face , with a gold toothpick always hanging out of the corner of his mouth , and a good cotton-making record . Hamish told the overseer to go easy on the whip , the people were n't accustomed to it , and we left for New Orleans by steamboat . It was April then . One Sunday morning , after our return to New Orleans , I was standing by the grill to the patio , Hamish beside me . Down that bright morning vacancy a young woman , accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pace of the very little boy . The little boy , I observed on a nearer view , was wearing a gray suit , very trimly contrived , with little gold epaulettes , and a little gray hat with a red feather jauntily on the left side , and strapped manfully at his waist was a shiny little tin sword . Soberly , he came along , and the sword banged against his uncertain little knee , much to the impairment of his martial bearing . " Come along , darling , " his mother said . " Hurry up , or we 'll be late to Mass . " He hurried the best he could , with the sword . I watched them go on down the street . Far down the street , he stumbled . His mother leaned , picked him and righted him and brushed his knees and patted his jacket into place and adjusted the sword . " They might give him a commission , " Hamish said , sourly . " He knows as much about it as some who 've got ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally as though a sad cloud had drawn across the bright day . But in those early days the city was gay . There was money to spend and people spent it . The bales of cotton were stacked up like gigantic masonry . The sugar bulged in the barrels . The long columns of profit marched with serried precision down the page ofthefactor 's ledger . Ships cast off at the wharf , yawed to the first suck of the current , and the new flag broke from the forepeak . Wine winked in the glass . Far away , there was shouting and music , the music men march to , and in some measured lull the fife was high and shrewd , stitching and glinting like a needle busy in sunshine . Men marched along with glittering steel , and the band played " Listento the mockingbird . " There is no way for the heart not to respond , in some way , to the joy of risk and promise . What was promised ? I suppose that some hard-headed fellow , here and there , calculatedin terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool market , or even ambition , but for most the charm of the promise must have been that it was merely promise , promise redundantly promising itself , an eternity of promise , like youth , promise intransitive . And to that glittering sign of emptiness the deepest need of each heart responded for its freedom , and the most secret dream devotedly flowed into that vacuum for fulfillment . Down the Canal Street the new regiments paraded , and passed on to their destiny , and one day it was the volunteer regiment of the gens de couleur libres , glittering past to the fife-sound , and from the banquette the eyes stared out of black faces of gens de couleur not libres . They yelled , too , and waved the old caps and the hats of campeachy . But the spring of 1861 was the time of the fires . The fires would break out at midnight , or in broad daylight , and no one could be certain of their origin . Some , however , leaned and whispered : the slaves . Perhaps it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on the banquette , with full heart , and yells , and in the dead of that night rises from his pallet and in a kind of troubled somnambulistic , marvelingincredulity observes his own fingers apply the little flame to the heap of fat-pine shavings thrust against the house-timber . Later ,  |p168he  is the one who dashes up the blazing stairs , seizes the child from the cradle , and saves it . I think I could understand all this . And why should n't that black fellow be as confused and uncertain inside his heart as we are ? Do I say we ? I should say you . For I myself , I almost forgot , am one of the gens de couleur and was once not libre . In the summer the fires stopped . Perhaps they had been caused by bad flues , after all . I had forgotten to say that the services of the volunteer regiment of the gens de couleur libres were not , in the end , accepted . It remainedfor Yankees to use them . Meanwhile , a little gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harry the outskirts of the city . There had always , even in peacetime , been such little gangs , hiding in the cypressrecesses , coming out at night to steal , to get supplies , to carouse at those illegal groggeries , cabarets as they called them , on the edge of civilization . This gang was , however , more daring . One night at Camp Lewis they had even knifed a sentry and then poured a volley into the silent tents . Rumor had it that the leader was the fancy nigger of Old Bond.  |p169BY  THE END OF THE SUMMER OF 1861-THE FIRST SUMMER OF THEWar  --  the quality of life had changed . There had been victories , the great victories in Virginia . But the banks no longer paid in specie . Confederate paper and shinplasters were circulated . Prices rose . There was distress among the families of poor men off fighting . Much money was raised for them , and I know that Hamish gave a lot of money . More and more rarely , a ship quietly cast off and slipped downstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quiet now . The spars of the ships were bare like winter , like a stripped geometrical forest . The steam towboats , snug under tarpaulins , lay side by side under the lee of Slaughterhouse Point . But the yards were busy . Over at Algiers , they turned a little steamer into Admiral Semmes ' first terrible command , the privateer Sumter . They plated over tugs and little steamboats with railroad rails and cotton bales to make a river flotilla to defend the city . Meanwhile , Hamish was on some sort of committee of defense . It was March now . Most of the troops had been called away now , off to Tennessee , to Beauregard , and many , so many , would die at Shiloh . Then Farragut came to the Gulf , assembling his fleet off Ship Island , getting ready for the assault on New Orleans  --  Farragut , who had once been a poor boy in New Orleans , but was now Flagp170Officer Farragut coming home . At the yards on the river , the hammerswent night and day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 'll stop ' em , " people said , " like a knife through butter . " But Hamish : " They 'll never be ready . Farragut comes soon . " There were the forts down-river , Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip . " They 'll never run the forts , " people said . " They 'll never break theboom . " But Hamish : " They 'll blow the boom . What 's the boom but a few lengths of chain and a few schooner hulks ? And they 'll run the forts . And then  --  " He flung out his arm in an irritable gesture of dismissal . " Then nothing but junk to stop ' em . Those made-over , floating cheese-boxes  --  junk . " Once Hamish took me with him to look at Fort Jackson , the big one on the right bank of the river . I sat in the barouche and saw the hulk of the old brickwork heaving , gigantic and saurian , out of the soggy savannah , a scurf of hanging grass and bushes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saffron sky of evening , on top of the parapet . The muddy river slid past . Downstreama woods grew along the bank . It seemed a sad place for men to die . I heard a bugle blow way off in the fort . The sound faded away , and I heard again the steady crepitation and hum of insects in all the secret marshland . On April i8 , the firing began against the forts . I sat in the patio that morning , with Michele and Dollie , pickinglint and rolling bandages . I became aware of a faint booming sound , a throbbing rather than a sound . " Thunder , " I said , and lifted my head to listen . Dollie looked at me sidewise . Then with a sly , dawning gratification , she said , " Naw , sojers . Sojers , they comen . " Michele nodded . Dollie let the bandage fall to her lap , and suddenly sat upright on the stone bench , with her knees pressed together . " Boom , " she said softly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so slightly . " Boom , boom , boom , " she said , and shut her eyes . Michele regarded her . " Make your bandage , " she ordered quietly . Dollie opened her eyes , and picked up the bandage . As shep171leaned over it , she said : " Ai n't nobody I knows gitten shot . " Then she giggled . " It will be blood , " Michele said , " anyway . " Day after day the bombardment continued . Farragut , they said , had brought up a great fleet of mortar schooners and anchored them behind the woods below Fort Jackson , and they fired day and night . Sometimes you could n't hear at all . Then again the wind changed , and you caught the throb and mutter in the air , clearest at night . " Listen , " I said to Hamish , one night in the study , " you can hear it now . " He lifted his head to listen , then said : " It wo n't be long now . General Lovell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forts . " Then he repeated the word forts , as though it were filthy and he spat it out . He rose from his chair , and on his stick , stood in the posture of listening . Then he stared heavily down at me . " You want them to win , " he said . I was so stunned I could n't say a word . " Do n't you ? " he demanded . I felt trapped , shamefully discovered by his question . " Do n't you ? " he demanded again , and leaned at me with an avidityon his face . When I still could not answer him , he said : " I would n't blame you . Not after all that 's happened to you . Getting sold off . Everything . " He paused and leaned lower . " Everything , " he said , " includingme " He twitched his shoulders . Then he said , broodingly : " I ought to have sent you North . " At that , the power of speech returned to me with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did n't you take me North ? " I cried . " Just take me away , anywhere , and be with me ? " He looked down at me , with blank astonishment . " Why did n't you ? " I cried . " If you loved me " Never before , even in the privacy of my own mind , had I used the word love to describe the relation between me and Hamish Bond . He had used the word , but only occasionally , with a kind of shy obliqueness , lost and uncertain , smuggled in among the terms and gestures of endearment.  |p172Now  hearing the word on my own lips , I could not believe it . In the first flash of my surprise there was a release , a gasp of my breath as though I had risen from under water . And then , immediately , a sense of guilt . But for what ? For what ? I almost felt like crying out defensively . In that silence I could hear the bombardment again . I stared atthe unmoving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that Hamish was listening now , too . " You want them to win , do n't you ? " he demanded . And when I did n't answer , then again , with suppressed fury : " Do n't you ? Do n't you ? " " Oh , what are you trying to do to me ? " I cried in my trouble , and tears were in my eyes . He swung his head away from me , lifting it to attend to the distantmutter . " What am I trying to do to myself ? " he said then . That night in Hamish 's bed , I lay beside his sleeping bulk and I wept . I had begun to try to think what the true answer was to the question , did I want the attackers to win ? The thought of their comingwas a terrible fear for me , deeper than I could define for myself . And as I was aware of that fear , I had , at the same time , some notion , some crazy notion , images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouching black people under the lash . The lash snapped in the darkening sky and the heads of all those crouching forms bowed and swayed like grain . One head lifted , and I saw that it was the anguished , accusing face of Old Shaddy . He was looking straight at me . It was then I began to weep . I wept because I felt so alone , and trapped . On the night of April 23 , Farragut ran the forts , destroyed the made-over cheese-boxes that vaingloriously engaged him on the river , and drove on up to Quarantine , where he lay all the next day to lick his wounds and wait for troops to come upriver . General Lovell , the commander at New Orleans , had seen with his own eyes the achievement of his enemy , and on a little steamer had barely escaped back to the city . The news came to our house in the morning with a great clanging of the bell at the gate , then a shout from the lower hall . Hamish wentp173down in a dressing gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was down in the hall , I leaned over the bannisters and watched him put a pistol into his pocket , and stump out with the member of the defense committee who had called for him . I wondered what he would do with the pistol . Would there be a last battle ? Men with pistols on the levee , popping away as the big black ships bore round Slaughterhouse Point ? I could now hear the spatter of shouts far off , then a growling , grinding , throaty roar that gathered and grew toward the levee . A little later , I saw the first column of black smoke rise , and as it spread over the spring sky beyond the spire of the cathedral , that distant communal roar rose to a pitch of rage and anguish , but , also , to some tone of a deep and terrible gratification . I noticed how suddenlybright and sharp the gold cross of the spire was against the billowing , unnatural blackness of the smoke . Then other columns of smoke rose , and more , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness , tumescent and swirling , was laced and licked with finicking flame . When I looked up , I saw the sun as a small emberlike orb in the pervasive sootiness of sky . Dollie came up to my room , then joined me on the balcony , breathless . " Bum ever-thing , " she uttered , in her breathless , bulge-eyed rapture , " dey gon na burn ever-thing  --  dat 's de word done come  --  dey burn ever-thinglak de Lawd say and de end come ! " " Are they  --  " and I hesitated , about to say the enemy . " Are they here ? " I demanded . " Sojers ? " Dollie asked . Then answered her own question : " Naw , no Yankees yit , jes folks  --  folks and dey burnen ! " She cocked her head toward the distant roar , listening . Then she said wistfully , like a child deprived : " Shore wish me down dar . " Hamish did n't come back until late afternoon . He was disheveled and smut-streaked . The mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up along the levee , firing the vessels and cutting them loose to drift down . The mob had gone back to work then , firing cotton . " They 'll burn ten million dollars ' worth of cotton by night , and figure they 've done something . They figure they 'll win a war burning cotton . " He paused , then repeated : " Cotton . " Then : " That 's what they believed in , forts and cotton . "  |p174Then  : " I reckon folks have to believe in something . " But ships and cotton had only been the beginning . The sense of betrayal and the rage had passed over into a general glory of destruction . Groggeries and groceries had been broken into . Looting had started . But even the looting had been crazy , seizing for the sake of seizing . The craziness mounted . Lovell 's troops , that might have kept order , were entraining for the evacuation . The Foreign Guard failed to overawe the mob , and broke before them . The frenzy mounted toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferociously climbed the sky . " Farragut do n't come soon , " Hamish said , " and there wo n't be anything left to come to . " After dinner one of Hamish 's friends on the committee came and was shut in the study with him . I was again on the balcony , watching the flames against the darkness . Dollie again came , to steal a look from the point of vantage . " Word come dey grabben , " she said . " Folks grabben . Grab and hit 's yoren . Bust de barr'l and ' lasses in de street . Lay down in ' lasses and roll fer de sweetness . Stretch de mouf and pour rum down till hit come out both years lak a bung bust . Lay down in de alley and love-up and who gon na stop ' em ? " I turned abruptly and went back into my room . I sat on a chair in the dark and tried to think of nothing . After a little Dollie came in from the balcony . She lighted a candle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doan you wish , " she said , " doan you wish too you down dar ? And de burnen and dancen ? " So this , too , was part of what the music and cheers , a year ago , had promised . Perhaps this was the deepest and dearest promise , the most secret  --  the brute , communal roar , the dancing , the flames leaping in darkness . Perhaps this was the fulfillment , the freedom , that all the lifting hearts had really yearned to . Well , they had it now . In a crazy way , I suppose , I had it , too . Later on , Hamish came up to the room . He had a carbine , which he propped just by the balcony window . He laid a couple of pistols on the table . He said that he did n't anticipate any trouble , but just in case anybody tried to break into the courtyard , he could commandthe gate from here . He would sleep up here , he said . He went back down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim/mee , putting on additional chains . When he came back up , he carried a rifle . This , too , he propped by the window . We made ready for bed . We did not speak during the process . Hamish Bond had not lain down with me on this bed since the night of the terrible storm , so long ago . Now , here , he would again lie down by me . The confused urgency of feeling of that night long back stirred again in me , under the present calm of my long habituation . It was as though something had come full circle , and all that had existed between the first and the now-about-to-be last would whirl away , like a puff of smoke . We lay on the bed , the candle out now , and watched the light flicker on our chamber ceiling . " Go to sleep , " Hamish said , almost fretfully . " I ca n't , " I said meekly . " Manty , " he said , " it 'll be all right . Just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brow and smooth back my hair . I shut my eyes and tried to let go , let everything go , under that lulling rhythm . But it was no use . Only by will could I keep my eyes shut and my body motionless . Then , after a long time , he said : " Manty ? " " Yes , " I said , and opened my eyes . The flicker was still on the ceiling . " You were n't asleep , were you ? " " No , " I said . He fell silent again . I held his hand and listened to his breathing . I tried to time my breath to his . I got some pleasure , or at least some sense of safety , out of that . Then he said : " It 's like that summer . " I supposed that he , as I , in lying back down on this spot again had re-lived his own agitations of that past . So my heart , suddenly , swelled toward him , and I clasped his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , " he was saying , " to make more space for the sick ones  --  or to get better air  --  and the tar-barrels were burning down in the street and  --  " " Oh , you mean that summer , " I said , and the sweetness that had been growing in me went , all at once , dusty . But he did n't realize the implication of my words . He simply replied : " Yes , that summer  --  summer of ' 53 , it was  --  and at night the light from the tar-barrel burning in front of the gate showed on the ceiling here , and flickered . And the cannon fired off all the time , top176clean the air , all night , too . And sometimes one of the sick ones would yell out , or something . Sometimes you did n't think morning would ever come , it looked like and when it did come , you  --  " " Michele told me about it , " I said , shortly . " She did ? " he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then , in a tone of reverie , " she was wonderful . All day and all night , she 'd work with ' em . All you could do , through black vomit and the dying . Jimmee , too . Work and laugh . And a lot of others , working and not caring any more , like they had come free , or something . " " Michele , " I said , " she said you had kindness like a disease . " He seemed to ponder that , then echoed me : " Like a disease . " IIe rolled heavily to his right side and peered at me under the flickering ceiling . " So Michele said that , " he said . " Yes , " I said . He dropped back and again studied the ceiling . " Tonight , " he said , at last , " it 's like that night we took the village . The burning , and the yelling and  --  " " What  --  what village ? " IIe did n't answer for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " damned if I remember the name . If I ever knew . But it was a big one . Burning , and the bodies around , and some crawling . Sometimesthey 'd split open a head and reach the hand in and the man still trying to crawl and  --  " I sat bolt upright in bed . " What are you talking about ? " I demanded . " Lie down , little Manty , " he said . " You might as well lie down . " I let myself slowly down . " You do n't even know who I am , " he said . I felt , suddenly , as if I were falling . " Maybe I do n't even know who I am , " he was saying . " Oh , but I know  --  I do know ! " I cried , desperately , and again rose up , saying , " and you are kind ! " " Lie down , little Manty , " he said . I lay down again . " My name , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's not even Hamish Bond , " he said . " Hamish  --  that was the name of a skipper I once did business with , and it came out a bloody business . He was a Scot with red whiskers on his face and ice water in his veins . And Bond was the name of the family ofp177that American kin on his mother 's side Prieur-Denis had . It just made it convenient to come in as a sort of cousin , a cousin from South Carolina . But who 'd been off in France , and then ship-trading round the world all his life . That made it convenient in case somebodyever asked about South Carolina . You see , I never laid eyes on South Carolina . " Then : " And I never want to lay eyes on South Carolina . " Then : " I heard my bellyful about South Carolina . From the time I was big as a shucked oyster . My mother , she was from South Carolina . Or claimed so . " Then , in the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a time it was different . But I just remember her voice going on , and my father 's shoulders hunching lower . " " Your name  --  " I managed . " Your name  --  what is it ? " But he paid me no mind . He was staring up at the flicker of the ceiling . Then : " She was a likely-looking woman . As well as I remember . Or must have been . Before her big black eyes got that crazy shine . Before one side of her mouth began to twist up all the time from the way she talked . It got so her mouth just twitched there . Even when she was n't saying a word . It was like the words were just going on inside her anyway , and I 'd look at that lip twitching and I could just hear the words , even if there was n't a sound coming out . " Then : " I can hear ' em now . " " Your name , " I said , " what 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Ag-lomey-klo-ha-palaver . " He laughed in his throat , a sort of constricted double gasp , quickly cut off . " You know what that means ? " he asked . " No , " I said . " It 's what they called me , " he said . " Captain **32;8674;TOOLONG . " He gave his laugh again . Then : " I reckon there was a time I was right proud of that name . " Then : " You got to be proud of something . " He went back to watching the ceiling . There was the shouting , far off . " What 's your name ? " I demanded . " It do n't matter , " he said , staring at the ceiling . " It was so long ago . " I jerked myself up in bed . I seized him by the shoulder and be/gan to shake him . " I 've got to know ! " I cried , desperately . " Do n't you see , I 've got to know ? I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the shaking , or my desperation . But after a moment , he said : " Hinks . Alec Hinks . That was my name . " I repeated that name in my head , for its strangeness . Then I said it out loud  --  in a whisper , that is  --  for I had to know how it was on my lips . " It 's funny , " he said , " hearing you say it . All these years and I have n't heard it . And now it 's like it was the name of somebody else , somebody I never saw , and him dead a long time back . " He heaved up on an elbow . " No , " he said , " it 's not like I said . " He paused , and peered at me . " I tell you what it 's like . It 's like there was n't just two of us here . You and me lying here on this bed . It 's like there was three . Like he was lying right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I draw , he draws one , and I reach out my hand "  --  he reached out and laid his heavy hand on my breast  --  " he reaches out his hand , too . " " Stop ! " I cried out , and shuddered under his hand . " We ca n't help it , little Manty , " he said , softly . " We ca n't help it if things are the way they are . " I began to weep , in desolation  --  desolation for what , I could n't be sure  --  the tears coming silent , just running down my cheeks , the way I 've seen very old people weep , easy , with no noise . I do n't think he knew I was weeping . He had lain back down now , and was looking at the ceiling . " Baltimore , " he said.  --  " I was born in Baltimore . " " Baltimore , " he said , and waited . " It was n't a bad place for a boy . Except for what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened ? " " Except for what happened , " he said . " And if it had n't happened  --  if it had n't been like it was  --  then nothing else would . " Then , after his silence : " No , maybe it would ; just the same . And the only difference , that I 'd be lying on some other bed , in the middle of the night , and some other city , and some other fools gone crazy would be setting fires and yelling , and the light of the fool fires would be dancing on some other ceiling . But me watching them . " He stopped , then I felt his hand groping at me.  | " Give me your hand , " he said . I did it . " Oh , Manty , " he said . There was a burst of yelling , far off . " Fools , " he said . " Fools . " And : " Tomorrow . Tomorrow they 'll come upriver . The fleet , black , and black spars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was n't a bad place for a boy , " he said . " The ships , and the yards , and the going-on . The war was on and  --  " " The war ? " I echoed . " That was 1812 , " he said , " and the British , and I was big enough boy to go down and watch the privateers fit out . Baltimore  --  that was the place for ' em , for the clippers . You 'd see ' em laying off , low down on the water , blue or yellow or green , with black wales and trim , or all black , fair buttock line and diagonals and bowsprit like you never saw , and the masts raked and sharp-rigged , top-sail schooner or brig schooner , oversparred and so tender that if you even spit wrong even in ghost weather you 'd capsize or pitch-pole . You had to know the touch . But give you a sweet one , and tender , and you could play her like a fiddle . She 'd tremble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , too  --  The Sweet Sue , why , she  --  but that was long after . " Long after the war , I mean . " I was a boy then , and the first year they started out just fitting the fast pilot boats , one long gun , the Long Tom , swivel or carriage , and a carronade or two , and cram a crew on till not room to stand  --  till after the first time you closed on a Britisher to board and after that you 'd have more elbowroom . " Then they started building the big ones . There was n't a thing I did n't know , the name of every one , her masting and sail plan , tonnage and . gun-weight and deadrise and midship section placement , and transom and tuck . " Down to the water , it was a place to go . " It was a place to go , and not think what it was going to be like when you went home . " My mother would be sitting there on that chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one she said came from South Carolina  --  andshe 'd set her black eyes on me and ask where I 'd been . But before I could answer , she 'd say : Oh , I know where you'vep180been . ' And she 'd put the back of her hand to her forehead and lean her head back a second and shut her eyes . Then she 'd say : " Yes , your mother knows . She knows you would turn your back on all she cherishes , and go consort with the vulgar . ' " And then the shine would come in her eyes , and I had the feelingI could hear a million screwed-up fiddle strings popping inside her , and she 'd say : Go  --  go to your vulgar companions . Twist the knife in me . Rub salt in my wound . Torture your mother who went into the Valley of the Shadow for you . Look at her . Reduced and brought down ! ' " She 'd run over to that old nigger woman she had and lean her head on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least Aunt Mattie knows how I am brought down . For she was there  --  yes , she was there at Buckhampton Manor and loved me . ' " You see , my mother 's family name was Buckhampton , and she never let you forget it . Buckhampton of Buckhampton Manor , but the Tories burnt it . Oh , yes , she had suffered for liberty , but look what liberty had done for her ! Only one poor old back-broke halfwitnigger left , when once she 'd had a thousand . To wipe her nose and draw breath for her . " Anyway , she would put her head on the old half-wit 's shoulder  --  when she was n't cursing at her for burning the bread . " Then she 'd lift up her head and stare around that room . And God knows that room was n't a thing to brag on . Half a cellar , with the windows high up and you could see feet passing on the street , and a carpet worn down to nothing and furniture falling apart and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame and the glass as murky as bilge water . " But I forgot . I forgot that that mirror was from South Carolina . Oh , yes , it had hung in the great hall of her father 's house in South Carolina and a million niggers polished it every day . " Now she 'd get up and go to the mirror and look at herself and poke her face with a finger , and say , Look  --  and come to this ! ' And then she 'd really get wound up and say how she 'd given her heart to one loutish and unworthy . " And my father would just sit and hunch his shoulders in his coat and his face would get more yellow-streaked . Which I reckon is the way you have to be if you 're past fifty and a clerk in a shipchandler'sand you get poorer by the minute and you ai n't genteel and your eyes are going bad so the figures blur out on the ledgerp181and that voice is in your head even when you are asleep , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your head , like a little white worm gnawing , and your son looks across the room at you and he 'd like to spit on you because you are dirt . " Your son thinks you are dirt for a different reason from the reason your wife thinks you are dirt . He thinks you are dirt because you sit there and hunch your shoulders . And do n't knock her teeth down her throat . " Yes , I 'd think that , and then I 'd feel so awful I 'd want to cry . I 'd feel like I had done the worst crime in the world . " But nothing was ever as bad as the times at night she 'd come and sit on the edge of my bed and lean over and cry . Her hair would hang down and the tears would drip down on me . She did n't want to be wicked , she said . She was just so unhappy , she said . I must love her because she was my mother , and then she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon . Or tried to . While the tears fell on my face . But at the same time I could n't stand it . " Then it was over . They let me leave my schooling . I 'll say this for my mother , she scraped up every penny for my schooling , and I could do Euclid and Cicero 's subjunctive with any snot , and what good has it done me ? " My mother had a friend with an uncle who was rich . He got me a job in the bank and I was supposed to get rich and buy a big house and a million niggers and a gilt coach and my mother would feel at home at last and I would love her devotedly . " The only trouble was , I looked at the faces there and they looked at me . I knew , and they knew , that in twenty years I 'd be just like them , and even if I got rich I 'd be gut-shot by then . " So I just walked out and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy to get a job then . The war was over , privateering was long gone , and there was a money panic . The only thing left was to build nigger-runners . Nigger-grabbing was against the law now , and the British were patroling Africa , and the only thing that could outrunthe British was the Baltimore clipper . " I could get a job just because I would work for nigh nothing , to learn . " I went home and told ' em . " I thought my mother was going to have a stroke . She tottered . The blood all ran out of her head so she was white-faced as whey , and then back so she was the color of a sliced beet . Then she said : Ap182common laborer  --  my son ! ' She said how she was gently nurtured . She said she once had a thousand slaves and they all loved her . She said how blood would tell and I was my father 's son . She cried on the old nigger 's shoulder . " What she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just getting one more look at my father . " I cut loose . All right , ' I said to her , I wo n't work in the yard . But I 'm going away . Because I ca n't stand hearing you , and I do n't believea word you 've ever said . And I do n't believe he does either , my father , and if he was ever man enough to say so , things might be different . But he 's not . And I do n't believe there ever was any BuckhamptonManor , and I do n't believe you ever were in South Carolina , and I believe you saved up and bought that one old nigger for only ten dollars because she is half-wit and pules in the porridge when she makes it . ' " My mother let out a yell like she had been kicked , but I went on . " ' Yes , I 'm going away , ' I said , but if you 're so nigger-crazy , I 'll fix you . I 'll go where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million niggers . ' " I came and leaned at her and she shrunk back , gap-mouthed and white , like she was scared I would hit her . Listen , ' I said , I 'll get me a million . I 'll wallow in niggers . I 'll be ass-deep in niggers . And then '  --  and I really leaned at her  --  ' and then you 'll be satisfied : " He stopped , and I could hear his breath . Then he said : " I 'm sorry , Manty . I 'm sorry for talking like that in front of you . For talking foul . " " I guess it does n't matter , " I said , staring at the ceiling where the flames flickered . He was quiet a minute , then heaved up on his arm , as though angry , leaning at me , and I saw the gleam of his eyes . " But , by God , " he said , " that was the way it was . It was that way , and that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it , by God ! " Then he lay back down . " Yeah , I said that to her , " he said , " to my mother . Then I started for the door . I looked back just once . I saw her face , all white and her eyes staring black and her mouth making a round 0 in the middle . I saw the old half-wit nigger crouching down , and the drool . I saw my father , and he had his chin off his chest . He must have beenp183born with a birth-cord tying his chin down on the chestbone , and they forgot to cut it . Now it was cut , you might say . Then he burst out laughing . The laugh was awful . His face was n't laughing , but his mouth was open and that awful sound was coming out . " When he started laughing , I made the door . I left the door open , and I heard the sound halfway down the street . " I never knew whether I had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I got him free of the horse-apple of a lie he had lived with all that time , maybe there was n't anything to live for now . Maybe he just dried up and blew away . " " I went down to the water . There was a new one , just finished , lyingoff , and I knew as well as you ever know anything that she was for me . " She was low on the water , yellow with black wales and trim . Her bowsprit kept rising , and her masts  --  she was a three-master  --  raked back so much you just felt the wharf heave under your foot like it was a deck and she took the swell . She looked like a horse and him bunching for a jump . She looked like a hound laying out after a rabbit . " But all the time not a breath of air on the bare poles , and not a durn ripple in the evening calm , and the yellow evening sky reflected in the water like glass , and she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue-bottle fly lounging on the edge of the hawse-hole . " There was one man on the dock . I knew he would be there . " He was a shortish man , thick and solid . He wore a square-cut coat , long and full-skirted , dark blue , something so old-fashioned you did n't believe it , and a dove-colored waistcoat , with silver buttons , all unbuttoned except the bottom two . A big silver watch chain was hauled across his middle , big as an anchor chain . His linen was n't anything to brag on for cleanness , but it must have cost money . He had a kind of a flattish , three-Cornered hat , black , and under it , out the back side , hung a little plait of hair , red hair , tied with a black tic-ribbon at the end and chopped off . It was like you had unkinked the tail on a red hog and tied on the black tie-ribbon a third way up , and chopped off the rest , for waste . " He was red-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job out of a big chunk of red cedar with a hand-ax and had n't been too careful about the smooth-off . His eyes were blue andp184squinty , under red eyebrows that would have done duty for currycomb . He had a big silver ring on the third finger of each hand , a big ruby in each the size of a musket ball . He was taking snuff out of a silver box . " When I spoke to him , he snapped the box shut with a sound like cocking a pistol , and looked at me out from under the red eyebrows . I ca n't flatter myself that he seemed to like what he looked at . " But he gave me a good evening . He gave it like it was money and he was hard-pressed himself . It was a voice he had got up in Maine , where he came from , and had n't improved much of the gravel out in yelling into hurricanes for forty years . " I looked out at the beauty , which I knew was his . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed a couple of fingers down it , like it was the backside of his true-love and him just back from a sixmonthvoyage and might as well wait five minutes more just to admirethe material . " I looked out at her now , and said : She is sharp-rigged . ' " He grunted and never took his eyes , with their weather-squint , off me . " So I said : She is nigger-rigged . ' " He put a forefinger against his right nostril , and blew snuff out the other nostril with a blast that made ripples clear out to the brigschooner . " ' You think you are pretty sharp-rigged yourself , ' he allowed , pretty sour . " I 'm sharp enough to know it 's niggers , ' I said . And fool enough to want to ship out with you . ' " He looked at me in a way to make any previous look he had passed me feel tender as a maiden 's dream . Then he said : And what do you think I 'd do with a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swipe with his left hand at my chest . It looked like the sort of gesture you might make to brush off a fly , but I staggered three feet . " I came out of the stagger , and did it . I lay forward , and made to knock his face in . " I might have done it if I hit , for even if I did n't have my heft , I was coming on and wiry . But try was all , for when my fist was just six inches from his face , which had n't budged , something clamped on my wrist , and it froze in the air . He had grabbed me out of thep185air , and I never felt a grip like it . Then he put his weight in the grip , and I was nigh on my knees . " You are sharp-rigged , ' he said , looking down at my face like he was studying something in the bottom of a well . " Let me up and I 'll kill you , ' I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will have a long opportunity . You see , you booger , it 's a long way to Rio Pongo . ' " So Rio Pongo , it was . And ass-deep in niggers . " Rio Pongo , Rio Pongo , I said to myself , hearing Hamish Bond 's voice , and tried to have a picture in my head , green coast , purple darkness descending over the gold sky . I could hear the shouting , far off , toward the levee . Then he said : " Rio Pongo , the first time . But I 've seen ' em all . Everything between Cape Verde and Cape Saint Maria . Sierra Leone and Liberia , Monrovia and the Bight of Benin where the Benin flows in , but the niggers you get there have a liability . Eboes they call ' em . Get the sulks and sulls , or the vapors like they were ladies , and swallow the tongue , or just are melancholy . Windward Coast and Bonny River and Anamaboe , Goree , Gaboon , Gambia , Whidah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the first time , coming in . In the morning a squall , for that was the season , the fall not settled bright yet . Cloud lay over from northwestsolid like a bridge span , gray nimbus arching over , color of a dirty sheep-belly . Then the rain came all at once , solid , like you had knocked the bottom out of a barrel , and the barrel sky-high and skysize , and you under it . The rain tromped the ship in the sea . And the lightning , it never let up , red sheetfire and stab , all around . " Then it was gone , like it had never happened , thin mist settling down now , like a dust-haze , brown-blue and no wind to speak of , and the sea long and greasy and dirty beer color , running out from your forefoot . Not even a cat's-paw showed . We bore in on a long tack , slow like a dream , but steady , under our kites and moon-rakers . We were under them , for there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were light-weather flyers . They carried sail that could pick up the new breeze if a gull belched five miles to windward . They could move like a dream . A dead calm , and they 'd leave a British cruiser like a cow staked out on the common.  | " But coming in to Rio Pongo . Coming on evening , the sun broke astern and the light lay long out level over the water toward the east where we bore in . The light picked out the long line of the surf , white like you could n't believe it . Then we lifted the beach , yellow , like somebody had dipped his finger in a paint pot and smeared one line , yellow and just finger-wide , across the middle of the world , north to south , and dead level . Only it broke at the river , then picked up . " Above the beach there was the line of jungle . It was a purplegreenline . " It 's always that way , up and down that coast , the surf-line , dead white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beach-line and then the jungle . Maybe a rise of ground like at Whidah . You would lay off , and the coast blacks  --  Kroo-men , they call ' em , fellows with red nightcaps and white drawers , and they were like a combination of a crocodile and the miracle of walking on the water  --  would paddleout and take you ashore . That surf was murder and you did n't draw breath for five minutes . Not in that smother . And sharks thick as herring in a brine barrel , and hungry as Hell-mouth . But those Kroo-men would take you through . " On the beach they start howling around you  --  the station-niggers , I mean , not Kroo-men  --  young and old , flap-jawed and slack-jointed except for two or three old boogers over yonder squatting on a bone-white drift-log , black-naked and sweat-slick , with the chin nigh on the knees and the arms hanging straight down for tiredness , looking like a brace of turkey-buzzards taking siesta . " Up yonder is the town , grass and mud and palmyra leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongo or whatever he called himself  --  andthe old mud fort , if it was an old station , with half the guns spiked or rusted out long back but perhaps a couple still good for firinga salute . There 's no use for ' em for anything else . Not against the niggers anyway , for if you 're a slave-trader they love you . They love you the way a baby loves his mammy bringing the sugar-tit . For you are bringing that rum . That is , they love you if they are not some of the ones getting traded off . " They are over yonder in the barracoon , back from the beach . A big palisade thing , the poles sunk six feet in the ground to prevent tunneling , and laced with iron . Some grass roofing for shade . Guard houses at the gate . Sections inside to keep the men and women apart ,  |p187and  nighttime the noises I 've heard coming out of those places . Like dogs moon-howling and moaning . And what goes on inside , crammed in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , they feed ' em all right . That is , they feed ' em unless rations run short . You get a British cruiser settling down offshore to a long wait to blockade the station , with your black warning flag up , and nobody will come in for a cargo . So your stock piles up , and you ca n't even turn ' em loose . You ca n't turn loose a thousand howling and gut-crazy savages on that peaceful and rum-soaked local population . It would not be , you might say , Christian . " I have been the first ship in to a station , after a blockade broke , and I have seen the bodies floating inside the bar , in slack water . The women float face down , with the butt up and awash , for that 's the fattiest part . The men float face up , just sky-staring . " The sharks and such have long since had all they want . They just nose ' em aside . " Well , if you 've just run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The factor or Mongo or whatever , he comes out to meet you . He is going to show you hospitality . He 's got rum and brandy and claret , and if he is a real king of the Coast , that claret is going to be Margaux , nigh old as you are and laid down the right year , and the brandy is going to be older . Then he 's got some cards and dice . And he 's got some women . One of those real kings of the coast , like Da Souza the big Cha-Cha at Whidah , or Don Pedro , there was n't any shape , size , complexion , nationality or condition he did n't claim to have handy . " But they were n't much to brag on . For one thing , the climate is awful . And if it was just some fellow with a toe hold on the Coast , he was n't accustomed to better than a half-Arab or some bush-black rinsed off a couple of times with sea water . " But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years before that . The ships I was on before that . The Defiance  --  not a clipper but an old frigate-built ship  --  just z8o tons burden and carried 625 slaves . Jammed on the slave decks , down in the hold , lying on the right side , one fellow 's kneecaps jammed into the next fellow 's hamstrings , spoon-wise . Except what women they kept on deck at night . I used to be lying on the deck with one of them . Yes , I admit doing it . And I 'd look up and see the topsail drawing across the stars , steady and frill with the trade , and I 'd think of my mother and how I 'd left herp188with her mouth making that paralylzed 0 , and I 'd think : well , I hope you are satisfied . " Then I was on a Portugee . I swore I would never be on another Portugee . And I swore that when I got my ship I 'd run it clean . " And I did . You had to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all day , gang by gang , on deck for air and dancing . I hosed ' em down with sea water . Every other day I hosed down and holy-stoned the slave decks till they looked white as ginned cotton , and sprinkled with vinegar . I made ' em wash out their mouth with lemon and gave chew-sticks for teeth . I fed ' em like the crew , fish stew or dried shrimp with palm oil and beans with biscuits cracked up in the mess . My ship did n't smell . I never lost money by it . I landed my cargoes . " And my crews , they stood by me . The times we had brushes , they did all right . " It took me six years to get me a ship . How did I get it ? I took it . " It was that Scot named Hamish . He did me a wrong , tried to beat me out of my wage . I was mate then . I was sort of glad he tried to beat me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . Then , long later , I took his name , too . " Ten more years and I had five ships . But them , I built ' em or bought ' em . " I was big now . I was big enough to leave business and go to Paris when I wanted and ride round like a gentleman . I had connections there , and big ones . " It may have been dirty but it was big now . I had skippers and factors and juniors . I had storehouses jammed with axes and kettles , knives and cutlasses , trade-guns and cloth , chintz and calawapores and braul  --  that 's a blue-stripe the nigger top-men and cabosheers favor for head-turbans  --  and spearheads and fishhooks , powder in half-barrels , and iron bars . Geneva gin and Yankee rum in puncheons and ankers . Great God , the rum . " Forty bars  --  iron bars  --  a head , that 's what we paid for a good one , young , joints clean , no teeth missing . Or what calculated at forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum . " They 'd come marching ' em in , out of the jungle , a collie a halfmilelong , thongs neck to neck , but the child-size and women not tied . Each one carried something on his head , ivory if it was a rich trade-chief coming in , or yams and hides and such . Guards withp189guns alongside the collie . The trader  --  a head-man or chief or cabosheer , nigger or half-Arab or what  --  he 'd lie in his litter and fan . There would be singing and dancing out front , when they broke from the brush . " Then the trading would start . That is , after we 'd given ' em dash  - -  presents , that goes to say  --  and soaked ' em in rum . They 'd trade anything . They 'd trade mother or father . Son or daughter . The poor ones , that is . The rich ones , the kings and such , they had the warraidsand the criminals . It was a crime to move a fetish-feather off a path . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't make the world that way . That 's what I said to myself . It was that way a million years . They raided and warred back and forth , and cut throats and drank blood like buttermilk , and chopped off heads for some mud-post of a Bo-god , who is nothing but a human man-part , and heel-hung ' em like a slaughter pen to honor a granddaddy 's grave , and if a British cruiser set free a cargo and landed ' em they 'd be sold again in a week , and be sold for Liverpooltrade-guns and Lancashire cotton , and if they put ' em in Liberia , where there was a free and civilized nigger country we fixed all up just like the Land of Liberty , those black Sons of Liberty passed their black brothers on to traders waiting on the border . It was all like that , and nobody cared , and do n't let anybody tell you different , and if you took one of ' em off to pick cotton five thousand miles away , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever doing him a favor . " You 'd do God a favor if you sunk that country under the sea . He may have made it , but it 's got out of hand . That 's what I used to say to myself . " And I said , I did n't make this world and make ' em drink blood . I did n't make myself and I ca n't help what I am doing . They drove me to it . And I 'd see in my head again how it all happened . I would wake up in the night . " Well , you can always go back to sleep . " There was the shouting at the levee and in the streets . It was nearer . I hung on to Hamish 's hand , tighter , and tried not to think what he was saying . If I thought too much about that , I did n't know whose hand it was , and I felt that if I let that hand go , I would slip off the edge of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Then : " Maybe it would be a favor to God to sink this country in the sea , too . Maine to Texas . " " If I had n't gone inside , " he said , " maybe I 'd be there yet . If the fever did n't get me . Or the British hang me . But I went inside . " Three ships I had , empty , and could n't get a cargo . I raked the Coast . Even at Whidah . Except for the mackrons , the beat-up and sick just good for shark-bait . You 'll have to wait till the wars start , ' they said at Whidah . It 's not the season for the wars . ' " ' Going to war is not planting potatoes , ' I said to that yellow-face Portugee , with the gold rings in his ears and the lace shirt . " The king will go at the season , ' he said . " I reckon I will go see the king , ' I said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , and he would sell his mother , and I have three empty bottoms laying in the Bight with sails clewed up and crews lazy . ' " The Portugee shrugged . He had lived there a long time . Maybe he was born there . Maybe he was half-bush . Anyway , he took that king pretty seriously . " The king lived at Agbome , a long march in . " I took three men off The Sweet Sue , volunteers for prize-pay , armed ' em so heavy a man could scarce stagger , packaged up some dash for that king , brandy and beads and a rocking chair and a lady 's feather fan , the ballroom kind , pink , and some striped silk shirts , got together a file of bearers , hammock-men and stool-toters , and I was ready to start . " The night before I started , two men came to me . They looked in the face like a cross between starvation and malaria , and their bones were done up in black coats . They were Wesleyites , missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . " What do you want there ? ' I asked . " They said they would expound him the gospel and persuade him from selling slaves and making blood sacrifice . " I am not personally in the blood-sacrifice business , ' I said , but I am in the nigger business . I am in it in a large way , if I may say so without indecorous boasting . Do you still want to go with me , and be defiled ? ' " They looked at each other . Then one of them rummaged in his head and found the right text for the occasion.  | " ' All right , ' I said . " They asked what the charge would be . " Listen , ' I said , I 'll deliver you to that king without mark , weal , wen , cat-scratch or bullet-hole on your body . All you have to do is pray for my soul . ' " Then you know what one of those boogers did ? He looked at me , and he said : ' Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beseech that your eyes be given vision and your soul find peace in the infinite mercy of God . ' " Cheap at the price , ' I said . But you better pray short tonight . We leave at dawn . ' " At dawn we were in the hammocks . Hammock pole nine feet long , running from one nigger-head to the other , and you swing under the pole , with a red-and-blue awning with fringe rigged over and tilted against the sun . It is like being trussed in a poke and bounced off the ground every three paces and the sun bears down through that awning all the time and what the hammock-men are saying about you and your relatives you are happier not to understand the lingo of . " Seventy-odd miles of that , past bombax trees loo feet across and palms standing separate and fine , the soil red with dry grass neckhighon the dry ground , and here and there a marigot to ford , stinkinglike a horse-pond in August , and a swamp like old coffee grounds bordered with fern-forest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maize fields , then some town . Bo-posts and fetishes , grass huts and a swish house  --  mud , that is  --  for the cabosheer or muck-a-muck , with a rooster crucified head down on a cross over the door , and the feathers falling off and his bouquet no help to your appetite . The cabosheer comes out and snaps fingers at you for politeness . They set up his stool and red umbrella , and your boys do the same for you , and you all swap rum and compliments . They fire off a few guns and do the beheading dance in your honor . When time comes to butcher a goat for supper , the buzzards who have been sitting along the swish wall where the skulls are stuck on the wall as regular as brass tacks in a chair back  --  well , the buzzards come down most obliging and help pull the guts out . " But all that is nothing to Agbome , the capital . Agbome is in a plain , where there is drinking water from mud-holes , but way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains begin . They say it is cool there , with water , and the wind blows fresh.  | " It is not cool and fresh here . The sun bears down on a mud wall miles around , buzzards sitting on it , and a dry moat below , and mud palaces inside , sixty feet high , with skulls , a million of ' em , set in the wall , and jawbones , and skulls to make pavement for the king to walk on . There are 20,000 live people . " You ought to see that king . That is , the one they had then . His name was Gezo . He had been king for fifteen years about , and he had beat all the tribes around and broken their towns . Of course , he had half depopulated his own country and shrunk the maize fields , so he was a king sitting in the middle of a desert , or nigh , and proud of it . But he was a king , and as a matter of fact , he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with strong-made joints but with a skull sloping back a little too much for beauty . He was middle-aged . I figured he would be worth about thirty bars on a good market . " I saw the booger sitting in front of his mud palace , with the millionskulls , sitting in a pavilion thing , with a score of umbrellas around , propped on a couch covered with clothes of all kinds and colors , smoking a silver pipe like a steam engine . He wore a violetcoloredskullcap , a green silk handkerchief round his waist , and shirt made out of a red-flowered damask that had been a table-cover in Liverpool before it got promoted to Africa , and a jewel-hilted rapier hung round his neck on a blue sash . " In front of him , on a table , were four skulls mounted in gold  --  or brass  --  to look like things , one like a ship , another like a flower , and so on . These were the skulls of special enemies the king was doing special honor to by drinking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neptunes you call ' em  --  of skulls stacked up , enemies not special enough to drink out of . Then , of course , the trees and posts had skulls hung up , with flags and banners or just plain colored rags . " Beside the king was a big brass spittoon . You wo n't see a finer in the Saint Charles Hotel . " His women were behind him , all ages and shapes and hair-rigs , some cropped short and stained blue or red , some short-plaited to make melon-stripes down the skull , showing the hide between rows , some in twisted spirals like cloves stuck in ham , and some built up solid like a block of wood hung with leopard-ears and bird-feathers . " A lot of his ministers and cabosheers were around , wearing their gewgaws and carrying Bo-sticks and trade-guns and butcher knives , and there were gangs of hunchbacks and jesters and about tenp193thousand of those Amazons . You see , this king had women-troopsasI had heard tell down on the Coast . Amy-johns they called ' em . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who make a nice specialty of carving off heads , then the gun-women , who would make a specialty of shooting , if those tradegunsand blunderbusses were any good in the first place and they had ever learned to aim in the second , then the skull-breaking women , who had iron-nubbed clubs and the biceps of blacksmiths , and the bow-and-arrow women . They were all supposed , in a manner of speaking , to be wives of the king , and if one of them ever got caught irregular , there was hell to pay for all concerned . But the king never touched them himself . The notion was , you might say , that you did n't want to get the minds of those ladies off the business of bloodletting . But it looked like those ladies had got the bloodletting and the other thing all mixed up , when they started firing off guns and dancing and squatting and waving their hips and beating gongs to honor His Highness . " You see , it was the time of the big celebration , what they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to sit through it . " It was bigger than an election barbecue . " The Amy-johns were dancing by squad , gang and regiment , slung all over with bullet-bags , powder-calabashes , water-gourds , fetishsacks , pipe-cases , and human jawbones , to bounce and bang , and waving razors and firearms . All the ministers danced . The cabosheers ( lanced . The hunchbacks danced . There was a steady firing-off of trade-guns , and now and then somebody overcharged one , and it blew his hand off . This was regarded as very funny . Some old shipguns , carronades , had been hauled up from the Coast , seventy-five miles , and stuck in the ground , and they fired them off . The big men and the head Amy-johns stood up and made their brags . Everybody drank rum , and yelled . " The king drank his rum out of the gold-or-brass-mounted skulls . Then he danced , and ministers and cabosheers lay on the ground in front of him and put dust on their heads . " Some days they showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to make the populace bug-eyed . " It was a walking pawnshop . Copper pots , a big mirror with a crack across and gold peeling off the frame  --  just like my mother 's mirror from South Carolina  --  a couple of iron horns five feet long , colored apothecary jars , a lot of dry goods strung out to be admired ,  |p194a  Paris barouche pulled by a sweating team of citizens , for there 's not but one horse in the country and he 's too weak to pull anything , a green chariot of some kind , with lions painted on it , an Ohio trottingwagon with the leather hood rotting off , a sedan-chair with the gilt gone , a ship figurehead , a full-busted lady with a trumpet , carved and painted , mounted on a platform supported on the heads of bearers , a child 's hobbyhorse , a violin with the strings snapped long back , a few pieces of silver plate , a silk hammock . Then , behind everything , was my rocking chair . On a fellow 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day the king sat in it and rocked . That gave me hope we could do our private business . But there was still a lot more public business . " The big part of that public business was killing off the sacrifices . There was a whole pen full of those fellows , dressed in white cotton Mother Hubbards and white caps on their heads , eyes bugged out , whites rolling , admired by the populace and well fed , waiting to be bastinadoed or throat-cut , and sent on to report to the king 's father . Every night or so  --  Evil Night  --  they finished off a few . The king set the example with some expert butchery , and then the right officials took over . The blood collected in ditches dug for the purpose . I had heard tell that they collected enough blood this way to float a canoe , and did . With the king in it . But that is a cruel libel . There was no canoe in it with any king . But one or two old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered me a swig , but I politely declined . " In fact , some of the sacrifices were n't bled at all . They simply got hung up by their heels on racks and beat to death . But blooded or not blooded , all the fellows got left on display . The buzzards , who sat around all the trees and the palace wall , like senators waiting to vote , would flop down for tiffin . The dancing and gun-firing did n't faze ' em . The naked children paddled in the special mud over by the palace gate , and made little mud Bo-gods , or mud-pies . The Wesleyites did n't like it . They prayed quite a lot . " The women sacrifices were killed private in the palace to maintaindecency , so I did n't see any of that . " But my business , I worked it . The last day , I was invited to dance before the king . I did it . I stripped me down to the waist , and I danced for two hours . I did hornpipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs in the air . I did back somersaults . I waltzed slow and sang to myself , with my eyes closed and my armsp195like I held a lady and I was in Paris . I jumped in the air and clicked my heels three times before hitting ground . The tricks I did those poor untutored savages had never thought of . They broke bones trying . " I lost twenty pounds in two hours , but that Gezo took a shine to me . He made me sit on a stool to one side of his rocking chair , under the big red umbrella with the silver fringe . I knew I had him then . " Meanwhile , the king wanted the Wesleyites to dance . They shook their heads and looked sick . They had been looking sicker every day , and I must admit I had n't been too sympathetic . When some booger would get hung up and beat to death , I 'd say : Now , brother , do you think I ought to leave him here , or maybe buy him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favor now . I told them if they wanted to get on the good side of Gezo they had better dance . " They said dancing was against their religion . " I pointed out that Gezo was getting cross . " They said they feared no wrath of the heathen . " I said , that might be true , but they had come here to soften up the heathen , and it looked like dancing was the only way . I pointed out that there was good precedent in King David . " They said they would dance . " They got up to dance , the brace of ' em , and that made me even higher in favor with Gezo . He was fanning himself now with the pink ballroom plume fan I had brought . " They started dancing , if you call it that , two coast-fever skeletons sweating in black coats , doing a kind of slow shuffle in the tramped dust , with a lot of naked , hung-up black bodies and turkey-buzzards for a background , and naked pickaninnies paddling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , let us be joyful , joyful , joyful , When we meet to part no more . " That was the last I ever saw of them . " Next day I was off on my business , a special-early war-raid that I had talked the king into . We headed inland , the army and I. That is , the part of the army old Gezo had assigned me , a gang of blunderbussAmy-johns and razor-women and a sprinkling of the other kind , and some men fighters and a lot of men bearers . We straggled across the open country to the jungle , me and the three men off The Sweetp196Sue banging in our hammocks , the army yawking and whooping like kids out of school . Then we came to the jungle . " The jungle on the way to Agbome was an old maid 's verbena garden compared to this . Trees a hundred and fifty feet high , and vine hanging down big as your body . You never saw such rigging . Ants on the ground the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell like a backhouse . Daylight never comes in there . Bats hang on those high sycamores , way up , so thick you ca n't see the white wood . Butterflies the size of soup plates drift out of the shadow . They are red and black and gold . They move so slow you think they are asleep in the air , just lying on shadow . When they do move , they are so big you hear the wings creak like tackle . " Meanwhile , the army is yawking and yammering . Their big idea of strategy is to yawk and yammer as much as possible , and go right by the town you aim to break , and then squat down a few hours in the bush and come back at night . It is a surprise attack , which dependsfor its success , you might say , on the fellow who is to be surprisedbeing deaf , dumb , paralyzed and stupid . " He must have been . The surprise worked . " We hit just after midnight . We burst through the thorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to work . " I stood in the middle and watched it . They threw burning billets on the thatch of the houses and waited for people to run out . They shot ' em and clubbed ' em and razored ' em , this in the middle of the gigantic bonfire which that town had by now got to be , and with yelling to split the eardrums . Enthusiasm was at such a pitch that a lot of valuable two-legged property was being destroyed . There might not be enough of a cargo to be worth marching back to Whidah . " But by now they were working on the wounded . Those Amyjohnsran from pile to pile , and they did n't kill ' em quick . They killed ' em slow . They carved ' em with razor-work of the greatest tact and delicacy and left the deprived objects still crawling . This was extremely funny . They cracked open heads and dipped their ribbons and rigs and furbelows in blood and plastered more blood on the gun-stocks to stick cowrie shells in to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle , and saw it , and heard the yells and watched the flame leaping to light up the jungle-top , with a million disturbed bats wheeling and weaving in the upper light , and it was all like a dream . I could not believe it was true , and yet when I looked roundp197and saw those three men I had brought off The Sweet Sue , I knew it was true . They were not lily-fingered and they were not lily-livered , I knew for a fact , but they certainly had a lily-complexion now . They looked sicker than Wesleyites . " I said I could n't believe it was true . It was like a dream . It was like a dream you had had long back , but did n't know you had had until , suddenly , now you remember it , and the dream is coming true . It is coming true , just like , deep inside you , you had known it would . Known without exactly knowing , that is . " I said : This is not me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the picture of my mother 's face in my head , that last day , and I said : I reckon you are satisfied now . " They were howling and working on the wounded . " Then it happened . " I was looking right at a pile being sorted out by a couple of Amyjohnswith a man helping . They razor-worked a few of them that were about gone anyway . Then they uncovered a woman sort of propped up on somebody under her , with her eyes wide open . She was alive , all right , and on the ground , right in front of her , was a baby . It was a baby just born . I stood and stared . " They dragged the mother a couple of feet and carved her . It looked like I could n't move . " But I moved . I moved when that fellow who was helping the Amy-johns lifted up his spear to take a poke at the baby . " I moved in on him , and grabbed the spear-haft with my left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Meanwhile , one of the Amyjohnsmade a pass for the baby . I just shoved her a little . " It was very peculiar , the way you have a habit . I shoved her gentle because she was , in a way of speaking , a lady , and I had learned manners back in Baltimore . Here she was , a crocodile-hided , blooddrinkingold frow , who had been in her line of business for twenty years , and I caught myself making allowances for a lady . " She disabused me . She took a swipe at me with her razor-knife and got me in the right leg , a long , jagged swipe . I did n't feel much , but I let her have it . I gave her the butt of the spear in her leathery old bread-basket , and I did not spare honest effort . " I reckon I was a little crazy by then . I reckon that in my way I wanted some blood , too , by now . I reckon I stood there a few seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor-women . Then the chaps from The Sweet Sue were by me , and fired off a couple of rounds into the ground just underfoot of the pair coming on . " It would n't have done any good against the mob , whatever hot lead we had to offer , but it gave pause . Then one of the head Amyjohnscame up . She took my side , to my great surprise , assuming , I reckon , that that rocking chair had put me in special status with Gezo . " She waved back the pair that had been given pause , took a couple of clouts with a gun-stock at the head of the lady on the ground , the one I had broke-winded with the spear-haft . She clouted so hard that she bounced off a couple of those trophy cowries plastered on the stock with dry blood . " Then she picked up that black infant , and thrust it at me . I was so surprised I dropped the spear and took it . I just stood there , bleeding down the right leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not so high now , and the bats whistling and chirrupingin the quiet that had come on just for a second as everybody watched me , and I was damned if I knew what it was all about . Maybe the head Amy-john thought I wanted to eat the brat . " Well , the bloom was off the party now . The revelry died down . One of the chaps off The Sweet Sue bandaged up my leg . It was all right for a few days , moderately sore , but by Agbome , it was swellingbad . By Whidah I was off my head . But they were putting some kind of brew on it and plastering it with farina and a leaf for a plaster , and I pulled through . " Meanwhile , we had taken on cargo . Not a full one , though , even after all that time and energy . But I ordered the two other brigs to work the Coast south , and I laid course for Cuba . As I say , I did n't have a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My leg never did get good . It makes some difference in a man to have an infirmity come that way , right when you are stoutest and do n't give a damn . It 's not just that it slows you down . " The big difference after the trip in was that I felt I had come to the end of nigger-trading . I do n't mean that the praying of those Wesleyites did me any good on High . And I knew that nothing I did would change things on that Coast . It was just that I had finished a thing I had had to do , and now I had to do something else.  | " It was during that time I got acquainted with Prieur-Denis . A cousin of his in Paris was a great gentleman  --  oh , yes  --  but he made secret investments with me . Well , he wrote me a letter saying he had a young cousin who had come to France from New Orleans , who was in debt , was not straight with cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , a personality that would do better on the Gold Coast than in Paris . If fever got him , so much the better . " So Charles de Marigny Prieur-Denis came to me . And when I left the business I sold him one of my brigs , part on credit , but then he came into his inheritance in Louisiana , and went back . " I had left the business . I kept just The Sweet Sue , and knocked out the slave decks . I tried trading two years in the East . But I came back to the Coast . I simply got drawn back . But now I had a legitimatestation and plantation , pineapples , malagetta pepper , yams , pineapples , and such , and traded for palm oil , hides and gold . But nothing felt right , not now . " Then I got the idea . Or rather , it seemed like one more thing , maybe the last , I had to do . So I wrote Prieur-Denis in New Orleans . I told him I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said , from his grand kinsman in Paris . And he understood . " So I came to New Orleans as Hamish Bond , the dear cousin of Charles de Marigny Prieur-Denis . He did n't have much choice . He knew , and knows , that the scandalous document from Paris and the stuff about the Coast are in the hands of a lawyer in New Orleans , to be opened if my death should occur under peculiar circumstances . He does n't want to be known as a sharper , a swindler , or even a slave-trader . Slave-trading is not respectable . It is just respectable to own them . The more you own the more respectable . " Yeah , my mother always wanted me to be respectable . " " Hamish Bond 's voice stopped . For a couple of minutes he said nothing , looking at the ceiling . Then he said : " I 've been respectable a long time . I 've owned a lot of niggers . " He stopped again . Then : " I 've always tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ever hated me . " But he suddenly raised on an elbow . " Except , " he said , " for RauRu . " And repeated : " Rau-Ru . You 're right , he was the one shot at me . And he had least reason . He was that one that lay there whenp200he town was burning , that new-born baby . He was the one they : tit my leg for saving . And I raised him the best I could . Like a son . swear it . " " What 's a k'la ? " I said . " A k'la , " Hamish Bond echoed . " That 's a kind of special slave . It 's almost like a brother or son or something . It 's the one you tell your secrets to . It 's the one when you die that dies with you . Maybe they kill him . Maybe he just sits down and dies . " Then , after a little : " A k'la , he 's sort of like a part of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , then said : " Yeah , I reckon that 's why he hated me . " I thought of Rau-Ru , and the shot from the green woods . Well , now Hamish Bond could admit it was Rau-Ru . His voice was saying : " I always reckoned Rau-Ru was a Koromantine . That 's the best kind off the Coast . He was n't the right tribe , but he must have been part . There 's a lot of slave-stealing back and forth , in those tribes , and maybe his mother was a Koromantine . I always reckoned so . " Koromantines , yeah , they 're fine-looking , brave , you never saw the like . When there was to be branding , they 'd drive their chest on the hot brand-iron , and laugh . Not that I ever branded . You be fair to a Koromantine , and he 'll die for you . " I was n't really listening now . I was thinking , all at once , of something else . " Michele , " I said , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Then he said : " I know why you asked that . " I did n't answer . I felt ashamed of myself , somehow . " If you just had to know , " he said , " why did n't you ask long back ? " When , again , I did n't answer , he said : " Well , you 're right . It was Michele for a long time . And would have been longer , but I got the notion of marrying . Oh , my fiancee was respectable . But she was poor . And Hamish Bond was rich . But Michele , when I wanted to free her , to sort of make something up to her , she would n't do it . She said she would lie down at the door . So she married Jimmee , and stayed . And me  --  " He paused . Then continued : " And me , I did n't get married . " " Why ? " I asked . I was surprised at the sound of authority in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changing , dancing like thep201flickering on the ceiling above us , but even in that disorientation , some excitement of power had suddenly grown in me . " Why ? " I demanded . He waited a long time . " I just do n't know , " he said , then . " But I 'll tell you this , " he added after a little . " I did that girl a wrong . I did her what they say is the worst wrong you can do a nice , young , respectable , Catholic , priest-loving , beautiful , aristocraticCreole girl , and I did it to her the first chance . She was cold as ice , and suffering like a martyr . " But me , I was cold , too . I did it in cold blood . I was cold as arithmetic , and I did it like I was doing sums . It was something it looked like I had to do , to wind up some business . It was like a revenge . But I do n't know for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I told her I was n't going to marry her . She went to a convent . She was that kind . " I waited a while , listening to his breathing , which was heavy and slow , while he stared at the ceiling . It had begun to rain now , just a drizzle at first , but building up steadily . The flickering was fading on the ceiling , as the fires , way off yonder in the city , were wetted out . " What made you buy me ? " I asked , very deliberately . I had let loose his hand a while back . I was lying apart from him now . I felt cold and detached from everything . I did n't feel like myself . I did n't feel like anybody . " What made me ? " he said . I thought he would never go on . But he did : " I just happened to be in there , in the Saint Louis Hotel . I just happened to see you standing up there . You looked so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together , side by side , I noticed . And your arms just hung down straight at your sides . " " What made you buy me ? " I demanded again . " You were standing up there , and I saw that fellow . That fellow who started up to look at you and paw you . Hair greased down and diamond rings on his fingers and turning his toes out . It looked like I could n't stand it . I just did it . " " Kindness , " I said , I do n't know with what degree of edge or irony , if any . " Michele said you had it like a disease . That 's what she said . " " I used to think it might be kindness , " he said . " About you thatp202day , I mean . I wanted to think so . But it was n't . No , I just saw that fellow going up there , going up there to put his hands on you . Yeah , he was young . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him draw a knife on me . So I could knock him down . " IIe paused a minute , then said : " Like it was about Prieur-Denis . I wanted him to do what he did . To you . So I could test something . It was like I had to test it . " He waited . " Yes , " he said , " I tried to think it was kindness , or something like that . That day at the Saint Louis . " " Yes , kindness , " I said , " and you brought me here . To torture me  --  yes , to torture me  --  " " I tortured myself , " he said . " That 's what happened . You were here , in the house , and you were so little , and young . All my life just seemed like nothing . I felt old . My leg got to hurting . It hurt at night . I did n't know what to do . " " Oh , you knew how to torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me wonder , every day  --  I did n't know , could I escape , could I be free  --  and I did n't know what would happen  --  and every day I felt more caught and desperate  --  oh , yes , your kindness . " I suddenly sat bolt upright in the bed . Vindictively , I said : " I wish you had beat me . Till the blood came . Then I would have known what to feel . " I could hear his heavy , painful breathing , but I did n't look at him . The breathing stopped an instant . He seemed to be collecting himself . He said : " As soon as I knew how you felt I was ready to send you North . I guess I had always meant to do that . As soon as I could get up my nerve to be by myself , in this house , again . You have to grant me , that , I was going to set you free . " " Free ! " I cried out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free . When it was too late  --  too late . " But I did n't know what had been too late . I just knew the upsurge of the anguish . " Yes , " Hamish Bond said , soberly , " a lot of things come too late . " He reached over and took my hand . I let it lie passive in his grasp . " Even too late , " he said , " maybe it 's better than nothing . Maybenothing is ever too late . If it really comes . Oh , Manty , we 're justwhat we are . Listen , Manty  --  that day upriver at the landing , atPointe du Loup . That day I was leaving you forever and you randown the gangplank after me . It looked like to me my life mightjust begin there . Begin over . Like nothing that had ever happened ,  |p203had  happened . Like it was all a bad dream , when I was a boy and ran away , and all that came after . Oh , Manty , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I said nothing . " Manty , " he murmured . He rolled on his side and reached over to lay his other hand on me . I jerked my hand free , and pulled back from him . I guess it was my jerking back that caused it . He seized me . He was kissing me , but it was like he hated me . I struggled against him . But then I stopped struggling , even though I knew I ought to keep struggling against what was so awful , all of a sudden , and degrading . He was rough with me , not like he had ever been before . I was extremely frightened . It was as though there was a confusion of the terrible things he had told me , burning and screams at night , but somehow I was wickedly involved in it , making it come true . But I was extremely frightened . I cried out , I was so frightened.  |p204I  SUPPOSE THAT I OWED IT ALL TO GENERAL BUTLER-BEAST BUTLER , as they used to call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after his notorious General Order Number 28 , that any woman showing contempt for any officer or man of the Federal forces should be treated like a woman of the town plying her vocation . Or to go back a step before , I may have owed it to the New Orleans lady , whoever she was , who got on the horse car  --  they were really mule cars  --  one fine spring morning with her little girl . Or back another step , I may have owed it to Flag-Officer Farragut 's fine gold braid , which was an invitation to the little girl 's fingers , when he sat down beside her . She stroked the braid , and said to her mother , " Look , pretty . " At which , the conqueror patted her on the head and called her a dear little child . So the patriot mother spat in his face , and Butler issued the order . And then one day I came down the street . It was early autumn , almost six months after the fall of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blossoms of rose montana and bougainvillaea yet loop in tropic brilliance , but the air freshens off the sea and tingles deliciously in the throat like the exacerbation of wine . I was walking down the street , in a kind of dreamlike detachment which , even in those days of the furiousp205excitement around me , made me regard the events of the world almost as something seen through glass . I knew that I did not belong in that world . I was carrying a parcel in my hand . The parcel contained some fine linen undergarments , two corset-covers , to be exact , which I was to embroider . For now , in my decent little room on a back street , I earned my living after that way . The corset-covers , needless to say , were not the property of Confederate ladies . Not that I would not have accepted a commission from a Confederate lady . The Confederatelady , simply , had no money , and besides , her mind was not likely to be on new vanity , but on the son off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never again admire embroidery and toy with corset-laces . No , the corset-covers I carried were to conceal the rigor of whalebone that held in place the loyal Unionist bosoms of ladies of Federal officers . For more and more , the tone of life set by those as yet unblooded heroes who had come with Butler a week after Farragut 's assault was a tone of complacent ease . Let the tide of war roll far away . Upriver , to Baton Rouge , to Port Hudson , to Vicksburg . God had given them victory . As for Butler , he was too busy overawing civilians to commit troops to Farragut 's projects . So I got a chance to embroider new French corset-covers . When , with my parcel , I turned the corner I found myself face to face , quite unexpectedly , with three Federal soldiers , two tousled red-faced farmer boys , with tunics askew and yellow ringlets shyly showing under manly campaign caps , the third rather the counterjumpingtype , a corporal with sharp nose , tight-lipped , pale face , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence-picket . I almost charged into them , uttered a gasp , and for an instant was frozen to the spot . The farmer boys were frozen , too . Or , as is more likely , their naturallyruminant responses were a little more deliberate than usual by reason of a morning dose of rum . Anyway , they stood there , flatfooted , unbuttoned , and askew , and stared at me from great round blue eyes , slightly bloodshot . I uttered my gasp , came unfrozen , and jumped off the banquette , pulling my hoops aside to let them pass . The farmer boys mumbled something by way of manners , and one of them gave me a slack , engaging grin , full of gums and teeth . I smiled back , and the encounter was over . Only , it wasn't.  |p206The  pale face of the counter-jumper type was there before me , and a pale finger , quivering in schoolmasterish rage , was pointed into my face , like a pistol . The pale lips , slightly quivering , too , were saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , and you have insulted me ! " My jaw must have dropped wide open . I could n't say a word . My accuser swung his face toward his companions . " Look , " he exclaimed , " she insulted you ! " The farmer boys looked at him , they looked at me , they looked at each other . " Stupid ! " the pale corporal exclaimed vindictively to them . " Do n't you see she insulted you ? " The farmer boys simply grinned , weakly , under that lash of a voice . " I did n't see nuthin , " one of them then said , and shuffled his feet . The accuser gulped , and made the appeal to reason . " She got off the pavement , " he demanded , " did n't she ? " The farmer boys nodded . " Well , " the accuser said , setting the nail-head deep in the wood of argument . But one of the farmer boys had had time to think it over . " Maybe she jist aimed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for the pale corporal . I thought he was going to faint . But he mastered himself and went back to first principles . " Listen , " he asked , " this is New Orleans , is n't it ? " They nodded . " If this  --  if she  --  " and he looked at me with a shudder of loathing , " if she lives here , she is Secesh , is n't she ? She is a rebel , and if she is a rebel , she owns niggers and thinks she is a lady , and if she thinks she is a lady , she thinks you are scum , Yankee scum , and a lady do n't get off the sidewalk , oh , no , not for anybody , do n't you know that  --  or do n't you know that ? " But he could n't wait for it to sink in . " And if she got off for you , she means you are scum and she would n't touch you . And she would n't touch me  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sticking the finger in my face again , shaking it , saying , " Yes , you  --  you think I 'm scum  --  scum ! " I was trying to say something . In fact , there was too much to say . The craziness of the comedy was mounting in me . If the idiot onlyp207knew me . Me , a slave , an ex-slave with precious manumission papers , me , a nigger , a nigger gal Old Bond had cut down , me , a child of bondage this man had come to set free . I must have been about to burst out laughing at the craziness . " So , you 'll laugh at me ! " he screamed . " Well , I 'll teach you , you  --  you whore ! " And he seized my left arm . So I slapped him . It was a good round , ringing smack , solid on his cheek , and I gave a grunt when I hit him , I hit him so hard , and when I took my hand away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt suddenly gay , like giggling . It was a strange , funny sense of tightness , then release ; as though I had , after minutes , hours , years  --  how long ?  --  broken out of a stupor , a spell . As I said I felt gay , but I knew it was said I was arrested . He said I was an insulting rebel whore . He was shaking me , hard . Then I heard the voice . Then the voice said : " Corporal ! Attention ! " But the corporal did not let go . Then that wonderful , clear , ringing , bugle-loud , beautiful , strong voice : " Corporal , release that woman . Release her , or I 'll see you under court-martial ! " The voice broke through the corporal 's rage . The hands came off me . The corporal stood at attention . His face was whiter than before , the nostrils were twitching , the lips were twitching . Then the lips managed to say , " I was acting under General Order 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorize you to commit mayhem upon ladies , " the voice said , and I turned my head a little , and there he was , at least all I caught of him in that moment , a tallish figure , blue-clad , slender , erect , broad-shouldered , young , a captain , with flashing eyes . " I was arresting her , " the corporal said . And his hysteria began to return , he leaned forward , he pointed at me . " She insulted me ! " he almost screamed . " At attention ! " the captain ordered . The poor corporal pulled himself up , shaking . The captain was addressing the farmer boys . " Did this lady insult you ? " he asked . The farmer boys thought it over . " No , sir , " one of them finally said . " She was jist aimin to git by , best I figger. "  |p208Back  to the corporal , the captain turned , asked for name and command , wrote down the information . I watched the corporal 's white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever long rancor and outrage in him had made him burst out at me , was now confirmed forever by that pure , bugletonedvoice , the voice of easy command and clear certainty of the handsome captain , the voice so unlike the corporal 's nasal and rageraggedown . But the handsome captain was turning to me . " Madam , " he said , " you may be called upon to make a statement . " I was suddenly weak in the knees , disarrayed . " Oh , sir , " I said , " just let him go  --  I just want to go home  --  you see , I was going home  --  " I was aware of another figure that had suddenly stepped up beside the captain , from behind me , and was peering earnestly at my face , under my bonnet brim . I was so upset that I just saw the blur of a face , no more . Then the voice cried out : " Oh , Manty !  --  Miss Starr ! " The voice , and the face , were Seth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me Manty . They saw me home , Tobias Sears , of Litchfield , Massachusetts , graduate of Harvard College , a captain , aide to General Benjamin Butler , and Seth Parton , of New Hope Corners , Ohio . Seth no longer had his old piece of Oberlin drugget about his shoulders , no longer had snow melting down on his bare head , no longer wore poor , old , heartbreaking boots to offend a tidy parlor carpet or crunch the snow . He was a lieutenant now , his long neck now military out of the trim collar , not gawky now , his high , bony face with the air of command now as well as spiritual aloofness . But it was , I suppose , the ghost of the other Seth , the Seth with the drugget and the snow-damp hair , that made me feel safe again as we walked down the street , that made my heart stir with a namelesshope . It was different as soon as they had left me at my door , or rather , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard their boot heels on the paving of the patio . I heard the last scrap of their voices . Then I faced the dingy room , the couch in the corner with its tawdry chintz , the creaky chair , the carpet , the little safe wherep209I kept my eatables , the brazier where I cooked , the oil lamp by which I leaned in the evenings to do embroidery for ladies . I had lived here in this room , lived some kind of life , and had never noticed it . But now every object rose up in miserable mockery . Oh , why had my eyes been opened ? Opened to an unhappiness that I could not name . I wished they had never interfered with me and the pale , rage-bit corporal . A cell would be better than this , and all contempt . They had saved me , only to walk away , happy and discoursing together , dear friends together , leaving me . Then I thought of the corporal again , and my distress , and sense of bitter comedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas had raided Harper 's Ferry the first man he killed was a free Negro . Oh , the Southern papers had made much of that ! Suddenly , everything that had ever happened in the world , all history , seemed nothing but a savage comedy . I went to rummage in a valise and take out the papers , the manumissionpapers , that Hamish Bond had made out so long ago , before we went to Pointe du Loup . They had been in the brown envelope which he thrust into my hand as he took leave of me on the Pride of Cincinnati , as she swung in toward the landing for Pointe du Loup . But that first night at Pointe du Loup , I had laid the envelope on the table in the hall . That was the last I ever saw of it until the morning in May , a week or so after the fall of New Orleans , when I took my leave of Hamish Bond . He gave me the envelope then . Now I looked at the papers . They specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now , after all , free . Free  --  from what ? For what ? I lay down on the faded chintz of the couch , and could have wept . I had the wild impulse to get up and run out and seek Hamish Bond . He might take me in the crook of his arm and be gentle with me . The night of April 23 , 1862 , was the night when Farragut ran the forts , and the next night was the night of the riot and fires , and the night when Hamish Bond lay by my side , under the flame-flickered ceiling , and dreamed back to the old fury , and then seized me with that violence that had made my heart stop . Afterward , he had plunged into sleep , as one might plunge over a precipice , or plunge into a black water . The breath drew in and out of his bulk with a grinding , irregular rale.  |p210Still  shaking  --  shaking with what , with cold , with fear ?  --  I rose and flung on a wrapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , numbly , touching an object here , an object there , as though to assure myself of what familiarity there was in life , stopping dead still now and then in the middle of a room . But there was no sound except , faint and far off , the last twitching disorder of the vanquished under the dawn rain . That wet , gray light grew in the house . I found myself huddling , at last , in the darkest room , the study , where the jalousies were closed tight , huddling in a big chair , huddling in the last dark , while the brass of the great ship-compass strove to draw to focus the dull light , and the crooked wickedness of those blades that bedecked the walls began , soberly , to glint . The rain was steady beyond the jalousies . In many houses in the city , behind the closed jalousies , people must have huddled that morning , sleepless , dry-eyed with grief , sick with some deep , ineffable wound to the spirit , and to vanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move upriver . The ships would come , and they , the people who had been free , would be free no longer . But at that moment I was not thinking of their suffering . I was thinking of my own suffering , my disarray of spirit , my disorientationand fear , even as the forces of my liberation were movingupriver under the rain-gray dawn . It was mid-morning when I woke . I was still in the chair . There was Michele . I noticed that a light shawl had been laid across me . I thanked her . She shrugged . " Do n't thank me , " she said . " I did not even see you here . " As I fingered the shawl , she went out , closing the door behind her . I did not know what to feel about the fact that Hamish Bond had come in  --  had , no doubt , hunted me in the house  --  and had covered me . I shut my eyes and thought of Hamish Bond standing there , looking down at me asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hinks . Alec Hinks was his name . Then I realized what had just now waked me . It was cannonade , nearer . " Michele ! Michele ! " I cried , and ran to the door . She came down the hall , toward me . " Do n't be afraid , " she said , and took my hands.  | " What is it ? " I demanded . " Chalmette , " she said . " They have come , and they are firing cannonat the little fort at Chalmette . " It was not long before the firing stopped . Michele was right , it developed . The earthworks at Chalmette , disposed so as to impede an overland advance between the river and swamp toward the city , where Pakenham 's redcoats had once been slaughtered in another old war , were of little use against the waterbornebatteries of Farragut . When the fleet made the bend and came within the half-mile range , the little 32-pounders of Chalmette , supported by the neatly arrayed infantry , had opened . The fleet drew on , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the last of the ammunition at Chalmette was burned . The supporting Confederate troops there disappeared toward Lafourche , and the long line of ships , whose pace had scarcely slackened , moved on . This much from Hamish Bond , when he got home late in the afternoon . Later I heard that only one man of the fleet had been hurt , for all that expense of Confederate gunpowder . He had been whiffed overboard by the breath of a passing shell . They fished him out . As soon as the fleet passed Chalmette , the Mayor ran up the flag of Louisiana on the City Hall , the red-white-and-blue stripes and the big , pale yellow star in a red field . " There was that durn mob on the levee , " Hamish said , " and all the burned-out hulks  --  those that had n't floated down , and the busted molasses barrels , and the busted rum barrels , and the last , black , half-burned cotton bales that the rain had n't quite put out , and the rain was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , jam-packed , and not a sound . It was so quiet you could have heard a corset stave creak if a lady drew breath . It was like that , waiting . " Then they came , coming in line , and not a sound off those ships , the crews lined up like inspection , and the guns laid level out , and the gunners holding the lanyards . The river was just sliding by greasy like brown beef gravy , high water near levee-top , and the ships , all thirteen of ' em , sliding up past the levee , steady as a funeral . It began to rain again , hard . Thunder , a-sudden , like cannon , and lightning right on your head . " Then from upriver she came . It was the Mississippi . Oh , yeah ,  |p212we  were going to build a ram that nothing could sink , the biggest ram in the world , covered with iron , and it would sweep the river . Nothing could withstand her . And here she came . Adrift , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lightning , the durn thing blazing like a grate full of coal . " The crowd sort of bunched together . And then , the howl . It was like one single howl out of all those throats . You know when a hound sits back on his tail and gives a moon-howl , and all hope gone . Well , this was it , you multiply by a million , and it did n't look like it would ever stop . That was their God-durned last crazy hope floating by . " And Hamish Bond took another drink of the glass of brandy , and looked over beyond me , as though I were n't there at all , and beyond the wall of the study . Then : " They had figured on cotton . They had figured on forts . They had figured on the river-boom . They had figured on the Mississippi , and nothing could sink her . " He stopped , then said : " They just never figured on something insidethemselves . " He stopped again , looking beyond me . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round Slaughterhouse Point . She yawed round the Point , broadside and blunderbuss to the current , still blazing . " But there was n't a sound , not a sound , off Farragut . " He anchored off , thirteen ships , two hundred and fifty guns , or nigh , not more'n half-pistol-shot and a spit offshore , guns looking straight in the first-story windows of every house back of the levee , the ships laying in bow-and-quarter line , broadside available . " It must have been one o'clock , by then . " Hamish sank back into himself , set down his brandy glass , and took a bite of his sandwich of cold meat and bread . He had had no food all day . With a couple of others of the defense committee , he had gone to the Mayor 's office when Farragut sent ashore his demand for surrender . A Captain Bailey and some lieutenant , I did n't catch his name , even if Hamish mentioned it , came ashore to the levee . The mob yelled and hooted and shook their fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the two officers got out . They stood there on the levee in the rain , in the middle of the hoots and the fist-shaking and the shotgun-waving and pistol-waving . The mob shouted , " Hang ' em ! " and shouted , " Kill ' em ! " The mob followed on down the streetp213after the two officers , hurrahing for Jefferson Davis and General Beauregard . They just followed in the rain , on behind the fat captain and the young lieutenant , who did n't know their way in the strange town , yelling to hang them . " Heroes , " Hamish said . " Yeah , saving the country and yelling . And then we got to the office , there was old Monroe "  --  Monroe was the Mayor then , and again after the war  --  " and Captain Bailey asked for surrender of the city , and old Monroe , he started hemming and hawing like a lawyer , saying he was just a mayor and the city was under martial law , they 'd have to ask General Lovell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile Pierre Soule made everybodya lecture on international law , and the mob was beating on the doors and yelling to hang ' em . " Lovell finally got there , riding down the street the way he always does , with so much stirrup leather he can stand straight up and show off  --  that little banty rooster of a general . He said he never would surrender . Oh , no ! But he said he would get out of town , and Mayor Monroe could do what he liked . " What he liked , " Hamish repeated . " What do you like when two hundred guns are looking down your throat ? One broadside from Farragut , and this town would be like the nub of a dandelion after you blow the fuzz off . " I just left . It got so I could n't stand all that talking . " Hamish never went back , but they kept on talking for nearly a week . They talked in the Mayor 's office and they talked on the deck of Farragut 's ship . Monroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bombard the city , for Monroe to evacuate women and children , and Monroe said that was impossible , you could n't get them out , and for Farragut to go ahead and be a butcher if he wanted . Meanwhile , in spite of the fact that negotiations were in progress , a Federal detachment came ashore and , unopposed , ran down the Louisiana flag on the Mint Building , the red-white-andblueflag with the one big yellow star , and put up their own , and a crowd gathered . As soon as the detachment had left , a man named Mumford climbed up and took it down . The crowd tore up the new flag for souvenirs . It was for this that later on Mumford got hanged . In the end , of course , Farragut had his way . But that was all to come later . Meanwhile , the talk went on , talk about the surrender.  | " Surrender , " Hamish said , " what in damnation 's name are they talking about ? Like a bankrupt man borrowing money to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the floor of the study , bulky and dour , his secret anger coiling deep within him  --  anger , but anger at what ?  --  anger and the dour satisfaction that something was proved now  --  something , something he had always wanted proved . " Fools ! " he said , and struck the floor with his blackthorn . But I scarcely heard his words . It was the afternoon of the last day of that week of talk and bicker about the surrender . All that week I had scarcely seen Ilamish Bond . Every day , he had gone out into the town , leaving before I came out of my room . For I had come again to my room the night after the riot and fires , and had shut the door and bolted it  --  bolted it as for the first time , ever  --  but there had been no step and tap in the hall , all night . It was now a strange parody of the early times in this house , the time of my languors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hopes , the time when all my plans and efforts had been , deep inside me , like the jerks and spin of a June bug on a thread to amuse a child , and I had known , most deeply , that the days , and nights , glided like doom . The days and nights were gliding by now , too . During the day I might see Hamish Bond , but I would scarcely hear what he said , because of a deep , distracting process going on in me , and at night I would lie in the dark , by myself , my door locked , afraid but not specifying what I was afraid of , afraid simply , in a way , of endings and beginnings , but afraid of something else , too , and I would hear the voice of Hamish Bond again , as I had heard it on this bed a few nights before , telling what had happened to Alec Hinks , and I would see the flicker of flame on the ceiling again , flame of the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mob , or flame of the nameless village in the jungle , and the screams . I would remember what had happened on this bed , remember that heavy-bulked , rawhanded , stertorous , brutal stranger  --  the raw hand seizing my hair , compelling me , that compulsion outside me evoking some new compulsioninside , like a terror . And , remembering now , I would be filled with my shivering shame and defilement , even in broad daylight as I stood before him , before Alec Hinks , scarcely hearing his voice . " Surrender , " he said , again , " lawyer 's talk , and two hundred gunsp215charged and shotted and looking at you  --  and did you ever see what a broadside can do ?  --  and they talk , and talk , and try to save something , some fool notion in their heads . " And again he struck the floor . I could hear his breathing . " Why ca n't a man  --  " he demanded , but stopped in the middle of the question . Then resumed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just the fact he 's ruined , say , the fact something 's over , the fact all he ever did is nothing , nothing  --  why ca n't he just see the fact , and him just say , well , that 's that ? Say that , and maybe feel free . " He was looking down at me , and his eyes began to shine a little in the shadowy room . " Stop talking and forget it , " he said . Then he took a step toward me . I knew what he was going to do . " Just plain forget , " he was saying , and took another step . I knew how it would be . So I said , " Do n't , " but he had his hand on me . He dropped the stick on the floor . I heard the thump . Then he was on the couch with me . I said , do n't , and I told him not to , please not , but it did n't do any good . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that dishevelment and tearing of cloth and wrenching of me . Then I cried out , " Oh , I know  --  I know  --  it 's just you want to make a nigger of me  --  that 's what you want  --  a nigger  --  a nigger  --  like those niggers you had , off yonder in Africa  --  oh , you want to make me filthy like them ! " For a moment , even after my words had stopped , I kept on struggling . I guess his hands were still on me , still gripping , perhaps , but they were no longer forcing me . He was looking at me , in a peculiar way , as though I had struck him and he was defenseless . Then I realized that his force had just drained away . All at once , I saw that his face looked like an old man . It was funny , how it was still his face , full-fleshed and heavy-jawed and ruddy , in the last flush of strong life , but you saw how it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years happened , were happening , in a flash , under your gaze . His hands had dropped away from me . He was looking at me as though he had never seen me before . Then he lifted his left hand , not saying anything , and made a gesture of repudiation , a slight backhand wave as though to say , begone , but he too weak , somehow , for the words.  |p216Then  , in a hoarse , throaty voice , not much more than a whisper , he said : " Go away . " I went out of the room quietly , almost on tiptoe . Upstairs , on my balcony , I looked out over the city . It was about sunset . I felt very calm now , drained and tired . I looked down at my torn and disordered clothing . I made some perfunctory efforts to straighten myself . I stood there quite a while , looking out over the city , as light failed . I saw the flag off yonder on the City Hall , the one the victors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung torpid in that late light . It was Dollie who came to fetch me , quite a while later . " Say fer ' ee to come down , " she said . " Thank you , " I said . Yes , there was nothing to be afraid of now . Nothing except my own blankness . " Ai n't long now , " she said , " ' fore nobody gon na say come , and nobody gon na say go . Naw , Lawd , gon na be parlor-time , gon na be rockin-cheer time , set in de parlor , rock and fan . Fedder-fan . Dis Lawd 's chile . " I did n't say anything . " And you , " she said , " ai n't long ' fore you wo n't have to lay on de bed fer ole him . " She kept on looking at me , as though to read something . " But sojers , " she said . " Dey done come . Come totin freedom . Come drippin freedom , lak sweat and a hot day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , peered into my face . " Sojers , " she said , " ai n't you seen them pretty sojers marchin ? " " Shut up ! " I burst out at her , and ran from the room . When I entered the study , Hamish was standing in the middle of the floor . He motioned me to a chair . Then , with the tone of dry impersonal announcement , he said , " Manty , it 's time for you to go . " I made some motion in my chair , and he lifted his hand as though to stop any remark . But I had not been about to say anything . I suppose that my movement was simply a way of my body 's saying , Ah , here it is . I had not said it to myself . I had simply known it . He stumped over to the big Empire desk , garlanded and scrolled with the rich bronze , and fumbled in a pocket for a key , and openedp217a drawer . From the drawer he took a metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope . He came and placed it in my hands . " The papers , " he said . Then added , drily : " I do n't reckon you 'll need ' em forever . " I held the envelope in my hand . He said , " Oh , I forgot , " and went back to the desk . From the metal box he laid papers out on the desk , then picked up a little bag , a chamois bag . He came , and stood before me . He opened the bag , and took out a coin . He held it up between thumb and forefinger . " Look , " he commanded , " that 's gold . " Then said : " Look good , for it 's the one thing no matter who wins a war or who loses a war , it do n't change . It 's the one God-blessed , God-durned thing nothing ever happens to in this world . " He dropped the coin back into the bag . There was the minute , solid chink of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bag . " Take it , " he said , and thrust the bag at me . " It 's not any fortune , " he said , glumly , " but it 'll help you start . " He looked down at the bag in my hand . " No , " he said , musing , " not much . That 's why I do n't really figure why I held it out . You see , " he said , " I put what I had in Confederate . Yeah , I did that . Win or lose , I did it . Something in me just made it that way . I put it all , except this . " He paused , still studying the bag in my hands . " It do n't make sense , " he said , shaking his head . " Just to hold out that much . Why do n't I hold out a lot , to do me some good ? Or nothing ? But , no  --  just this piddling much . " He brooded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I always reckoned I was a fellow when he did something , did it all out . I led a rough life , and one sure way to be laying face down in the bush , or floating face up in the Bight , was to do something halfway . Yeah , from the time I saw my mother 's face freeze up white with the yell still hanging in her round mouth , and I went out the door and never came back , I never aimed to do anything halfway . But this "  --  he pointed at the bag  --  " just halfway . " Then : " It looks like a man is just going to hold a little something back . Just to be holding . " Then : " Even a fellow marches right into the cannon . He can be holding something back , too . Even when he takes the grape in the I jelly . "  |p218Then  : " Yeah , even him . " Then : " That stuff  --  that gold  --  get it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting it out . " He lifted his head , suddenly . " Listen , " he said , with an abrupt change to the tone of business , " this is what you do . Pack one valise . Jimmee will carry it for you . You go to the Saint Charles , or the Saint Louis , and get a room . Say you are from up in Tennessee , or somewhere , and your brother was at Shiloh , and you heard he was wounded and sent down here . Then tomorrow you go out and get yourself a room somewhere . You got to wait till things quiet down before you head North . A young girl has n't got much business trying to get through picket lines , no matter whose picket lines , and if you stay at a hotel , that gold will be gone like a snowball in August . Do you understand ? " I nodded . " I 'll send Jimmee to the hotel tomorrow with your other valise and stuff . " I nodded again . " Now , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the little bag in my hand . I did n't feel anything . I knew there was something I ought to feel . But I did n't know what . I stood there , and I saw a part of my life whirl away , like a leaf blowing in the wind , and I did n't feel anything . " Go , " he said . " Go on ! " I went to the door , slowly . Just as I laid hand on the doorknob , he spoke . " Listen , " he said , now in that grinding , gravelly , constricted voice , " wherever you go , whatever you do , I do n't want to know . Do you understand ? I do n't want to know where you are . " I was in the hall , before the feeling came . Was that all , was that all to take away now ? Was there nothing of any tenderness in the dark , any protective peace ? In my despair , I suddenly felt that this was like dying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became aware of the little chamois bag in my hand . Well , I could take that , I thought bitterly . A little later , in the upper hall , I encountered Dollie . I was about to step past her , when she reached out to touch my sleeve , saying , " Yeah , Jimmee  --  he done tole me. "  | " Told you what ? " I demanded . " ' Bout Old Bond , " she said , " ' bout him sendin you off . " " Yes , " I said , irritably , anxious to get her hand off my sleeve . " Gon na be free ? " she demanded . " I guess so , " I said . She looked intently at me , peering in the shadowy hall . Then she demanded : " Me  --  you reckin I 'm gon na be free ? " " I do n't know , " I said , and pulled away , and turned down the hall . But she ran after me , seizing my arm , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fergit ole Dollie . Fer I ne'er meant nuthin . Nuthin agin you ner nobody . I jes wants you to love me . " And with that , she burst into tears , staring up at me beseechingly , her eyes wide and the tears running down the cheeks . Something seemed to break in my bosom , quite literally . And I heard my voice say : " I love  --  I do love you ! " And then my own tears came , and I turned and ran from her . So I left the house of Hamish Bond and found my dingy room , in the dingy patio , and waited . I did not know what I was waiting for . For things to quiet down , Hamish Bond had said , so I could go away . But where ? Where would I go ? Where would I belong ? I stood in the street , and saw the raw jostle of life . I saw the victorsmove bright and clattering , hoof and steel . I saw those who had once been masters now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw those who had been enslaved standing on the street corner , just standing all afternoon in that delicious emptiness of sunshine . On May 1 , when the transports of troops came up the river , and General Butler disembarked , there was the great crowd of Negroeson the levee . There was the laughter , the high giggle , the shove and scuffle , the cry , " Amen ! Lawd God , amen ! " Ah , Jubilo . I saw men , or women , under the guard of troops , marched down the street to the Custom House and the trial  --  if you could call it that  --  before Butler 's military commission . I saw them hang Mumford . He was the man who had , before the settled surrender and occupation , pulled down the United States flag from the Mint Building . Butler had sworn to hang him . " You better catch him first , " Farragut had said , thinking it all a joke . But it was no joke . In June Butler hanged him . He offered so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you had to put down vice . If he did n't hang Mumford , the mob would think he was unable to govern . He had been threatened with assassination if he hanged Mumford , and he had to prove his contempt of such a threat . He had to hang Mumford to defend the honor of the flag . But later , when I met General Butler , it crossed my mind that none of the justifications made sense , or enough sense . I saw him , a shapelessman of indeterminate middle age , and stooped middle height , the dress uniform sacklike on him , the gold braid too important , the last thin gray hair brushed back over his somewhat flattened , shiny skull , the thin compressed lips slightly twitching at the corners of the mouth , the face white and almost hairless , the hazel eyes cockeyedand disturbing , never still , the hands restless and plucking . Yes , he had to hang Mumford . He would , no doubt , have hanged the entire world if there had been neck and rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaffold was in front of the Mint , where Mumford had exhibited his bravado , and the mob had cheered . Now the mob was silent , facing the hollow square of fixed bayonets , and the muzzle of cannon . Mumford , handcuffed , wearing a white suit , carrying his head high , marched up the steps of the scaffold . He conferred briefly with a clergyman . The officer in charge read the sentence . Mumford addressed the people . The drop fell , a communal groan was uttered . The white-clad body swayed , then was still . The drums were beating . At first , it all seemed like a show to me , on a stage . I was far back , on the very fringe of the crowd , and I was not tall enough to see very well . I saw the figures up there , black for the clergyman , blue for captain , white for Mumford . I could barely catch a word now and then of the reading of the sentence , or what Mumford said , which was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up there the figures were little , like dolls . When the white-clad body fell and jerked , I was sure that it would n't hurt , a little old wooden doll , way off yonder , jerking . Then I knew that it did hurt . All the waiting for it , and then the moment . Oh , what did it all mean ? Had Mumford felt that it meant something ? Or had his words been empty even to himself , standing up there , talking , sweating , desperately wondering if it was he , really he , who had climbed the flagstaff , really not believing that it was he who had taken down that rag of color ? Oh , what were those coloredp221rags men put on sticks and made music under , and died following , in the smoke ? I was full of a sadness , because it all seemed so far away , so little . Then my sadness was , all at once , a grinding misery , deep in me . I was miserable not because there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because there was , perhaps , a meaning . But a meaning that somehow I could not understand . Oh , that was my misery ! I was outside some meaning that other people had , even if only for a moment  --  Mumford at the moment of his fine words , the crowd at the moment of the communal groan , all the nameless ones plunging through the smoke-swirl , the nameless ones lying on last sickbed , watching the dawn-window grow gray , with a calmly growing , incredulous joy for the first , peevish bird , the last they would ever hear . I had a strange dream that night . I saw Mumford . He came to me wearing his white suit , somewhat stained and disheveled . Around his neck was the great noose , still tight , but with a frayed end hangingloose down his left shoulder . The noose was set deep in the flesh of his neck , and the flesh was raw and bruised , but his face was calm . He had something to tell me , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make love to me , and I felt the expectation of joy , but , suddenly , somehow , he was like Charles , Charles Prieur-Denis when he had seized me that last day in the hall of the house at Pointe du Loup , and I woke ready to cry out . But next day the figure of Mumford was only the memory of that little white-clad puppet , way off yonder , jerking on the end of a string , and I was living my life as best I could , and watching the life around me . People hummed " The Bonnie Blue Flag , " and went to jail , or wore the Confederate colors , red and white , and went to jail , or whispered Confederate victories , and went to jail , and the blue troops swung past in formation , sun on bayonets , or lounged in front of groggeries , full of strychnine-whisky  --  " damnation , " people called it  --  or simple rum . Runaway Negroes  --  contraband , Butler had named them , back in Virginia  --  crowded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward freedom . But were they free ? Nobody had said theyp222were . And Butler ordered that no more be admitted through the lines , had even sent some back in chains , from Lake Pontchartrain , to Confederate masters . But they kept on coming , like a tide . They starved in the back streets , squatting in mud or dust , according to season , stretching out the hand , waiting . Butler  --  and his brother who came down to help in a business way , so people said  --  got rich , licensing gambling , licensing groggeries , buying confiscated cotton cheap from the government agent under his command and shipping it North at war prices , taking sharemoneyof debts collected for Northern creditors , smuggling supplies to the enemy . People whispered that Confederate pickets  --  lanky , gray ghosts squatting at the swamp-edge or sitting gaunt hammer-heads in the dappled shadow of live oak  --  were only ten miles out of town . There was much destitution in the city . In a miserable room openingon the patio where I lived , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed near Corinth . I gave her one of the gold pieces . Later , when I had the embroidery , I set a little money aside each time , a few pennies , for the children . I felt I was buying something , something almost illicit , for myself . So the summer passed . Then all was different . But it is strange how a new quality of feeling , of your life , may be defined , unawares , by its very opposite . So it was when Seth Parton and his friend left me alone in my room . My sudden despair , the sense of absolute isolation from life  --  all this was , I suppose , a perfectly logical thing to happen . After all , Seth had been the object of my first , and only , girlish passionand dream , and his reappearance , and turning away , simply reenactedmy old story . But he not only re-enacted , and took away , the meaning of my past . He took with him , their heads bowed together in an intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the image of what must have been a secret , unacknowledged hope , the fine shoulders , the flashing glance , the bugle voice , the air of command of the liberator . Captain Tobias Sears had descended from the glitteringcloud to save me , had saved me , but then had faded with a smile of Godlike casualness , worse than contempt . But that despair on the faded chintz of the couch was the birth of hope . I discovered in it that I could live no longer without hope . I suppose that I had snuggled into my isolation , and even as I suffered from it had felt it also as a protection from the raw risks of thep223unhinged world I saw around me . Now I lay on that couch while the day wore out , and light faded , the baby next door wailed in its unassuageable , feeble grief , two soldiers , drunk , wandered into the courtyard , laughing , and one pressed his face against the bars of my window , and stared at me lying there , and I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel alarm or anger , and then the face was withdrawn , and at last I fell asleep . I slept till morning . I was very calm when I woke up . I felt weak , but weak and pure , as you feel after an illness , and ready for life . Tobias Sears called on me that afternoon . He came , he said , to get me to sign a statement about the episode of the corporal . I said that I did n't want any trouble for the fellow . He said there would n't be much trouble , that the corporal had a splendid record in battle and would have had a commission long ago if he had been able to control his nerves and his temper . " It 's a peculiartype , " he said , " so nervous and angry , he 's made for war and war 's made for him , the kind that 's a hero in battle . But when the war is over he 'll go back to Illinois , or whatever place he came from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dyspepsia . " In the end , I signed the paper . He lingered a while , I continued to work at my embroidery , tellinghim frankly that it was a commission promised for tomorrow , and would he forgive me ? He sat on his rickety chair and looked out of place in the dingy room . I made no apologies . Not even when , after he had lingered a long time , I offered him what purported to be tea , but was n't , and was offered in a cracked cup . He talked about Emerson . He asked me if I had read the essay on Transcendentalism , and when I confessed ignorance , he said that I must , that he would bring it to me . Two days later he brought it , and again sat on the rickety chair and drank the vile infusion which was not tea . When he rose to go , he asked when he might come for his book . He should like also , he said , to know my views . As I hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Miss Starr , " he said , " you see through my poor pretenses . I do not want the book back . I want you to have it . What I really want is to see you again . " I hesitated a moment . I wanted to see him again , I wanted that very much , but out of that new calmness of spirit I had to assess , even though fleetingly , the context of my own desire.
