When Roy G. Jacobsen , 26 , of Long Valley , N.J. , switched from Dartmouth to Columbia University in 1951 , he had some pretty exalted notions about what he was after . He wanted nothing less than to arn all about truth , understanding , integrity , enlightenment , justice , liberty , courage , honesty and critical judgment-the very virtues he saw extolled on countless plaques and friezes about Columbia 's campus . But after searching for the light , first a physics and then as an English major , Jacobsen gave up . In his senior year , he flunked four courses , and the college refused to give him his degree . Last week , when Columbia filed suit against him for $1,000 for repayment of a student loan , Jacobsen lashed back with a suit of his own . Columbia , he said in court , is guilty of " false representation " for not telling him that " it was not equipped to teach pure reason " - and wisdom . Jacobsen demanded $2,000 for every year he wasted at the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tuition had paid and $16 for legal expenses . Speaking for the college , Dean Lawrence Chamberlain said that wisdom is only " a hoped-for end product of education , " and that neither Columbia nor any other institution could teach it . But that argument did not impress embattled Jacobsen one bit . After all , with two other students , he is now learning wisdom , truth , understanding , etc. , at a special school in Long Valley called Gurukula ( home of the philosopher ) -a school , he told reporters , that is very much like Plato 's Academy . The Plato of the place : Harry Jakobsen , a $100-a-week tool designer-turned-guru . At week 's end a somewhat mystified Superior Judge Frederick Hall gave Columbia until Jan. 3 to file an answer to Jacobsen 's counterclaim.
