txt Some 350 cattle men told Ezra Taft Benson , the Secretary of Agriculture , today that they wanted " a raise in pay . " Mr. Benson told them " my mind still is open " on whether the Federal . Government should buy live cattle in a price-support operation to bolster weak cattle prices . The Secretary , who has raised and fed cattle , also told the cattle men he would be glad to meet with ' them tomorrow , when they had set down on paper what they believed should be done . A few hours later the " cattle men , some major producers , some medium and some small , voted unanimously that the first thing they wanted was a minimum Federal price support of 90 per cent of parity on live cattle . Parity , by Federal legislation , seeks to give the agriculture producer the same purchasing power he had in a past favorable period or a fair return in relation to the cost of things he must buy . Parity now applier to such basic crops as wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle . The cattle men , most of whom arrived here from about thirty states in an eight-bus caravan , made it clear they favored a high , ' rigid price prop for live cattle .

The committee also will work into its recommendations cattle men 's suggestions for more liberal credit to " keep cattle producers from going busted . " Needs ** Be Stressed - The recommendations will emphasize the , immediate needs of cattle producers but it is expected that some mention will be made of a long-range program . This longrange view likely will include the possibility of Congress ' acting after it resumes in January to reinstate in farm law the principle of direct or production payments to be applied to cattle . Direct payments , a major feature of the plan advanced four years ago by Charles F. Brannan , then Secretary of Agriculture , would provide for payment by the Federal .

Mr. Brannan now is general counsel of the National Farmers Union , sponsor of the cattle men 's caravan to Washington . James G. Patton , president of the organization , said that " quite frankly , we want to get price supports on livestock to protect all price support programs . " ? The price support principle , he said , should be extended to all agriculture . This is the basic position of his organization , which has been an ally of Democratic admin- istrations . The Democrats and the National Farmers Union have failed to bring livestock producers into the price-support camp because of the powerful opposition of old-line national cattle men 's organizations . The cattle men , many wearing boots , tight pants , two-pocket shirts , string ties and traditional cowman 's hats , of various shapes , rode their buses from a morning meeting in an American Legion hall to the Department of Agriculture , where they gathered in Jefferson Hall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Secretary , who had sought to dissuade them from coming but later relented and agreed to meet them , stood in an aisle and shook hands with many of the visitors . He , too , carried a fawn-colored Western hat , typical of his state of Utah . With him were many of his top aides , including Under Secretary True D. Morse and Assistant Secretary John H. Davis , chief of the department 's foreign agricultural operations . Mr. Davis presided at the session . Mr. Davis welcomed the group as " another to give us advice and counsel " in the study being carried on by the department in an effort to improve price support programs . Says Some Are ' Going Broke ' Mr. Driscoll responded with assurances that the cattle men , whose ranks included dairy men and cattle producers from southern and western states and midwest feedlot operators , had " not come down here as a pressure group nor for politics . " Furthermore , he said , " we did n't come down here to rabble rouse , we come in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe has been denied to the department and Secretary Benson . " Some of the men in the packed hall , he said , were " well fixed and some were broke and going to lose a life 's work . " Not all were members of the National Farmers Union and Mr. Driscoll included himself in the group . Mr. Driscoll , who operated two packing plants during World War . II , said he had lost $100,000 on 1,000 head of cattle last year . He declared that he might be able to last another two years at the " going rate . " But , he added , the " price costs squeeze , drought and terrible cattle prices have most small producers scrambling for credit . " George Bader of McClure , Ill. , a feeder , told Mr. Benson : " We 're not ribble or rabble and not here to rabble rouse . We feel we 're in enough trouble and the rest of the country will soon follow unless something is done . " Heber Bennison of Manila , Utah , said that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high regard for the caliber of the man . " Mr. Benson , he said , is a man of " integrity and knows agriculture " but the group was on hand to give him a " clear up-todate picture of how critical the situation is because he has not been fully informed and sometimes misinformed . " Mr. Bennison is former Utah secretary of state , former speaker of the Utah House of Representatives , and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for governor in 1952 . Lowell , Peterson of Bay City , Wis. , pleaded " for this Administration to consider the plight of the dairy man . " He related that he sold ecow that had cost him $325 for $77 last week . " A year ago , the cow would have brought the purchase price , " he said . Difficulties Are Noted Mr. Benson rose in the glare of newsreel and television lights and to the popping of camera flashbulbs to tell the cattle men that the meeting was an example of two inherent rights : the right of assembly and the right to petition the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should be held precious . " The cattle men stood to applaud Mr. Benson as he prepared to speak . They applauded again and a few " yipees " were heard when he stated he had an " open mind " on price supports for live cattle . Another burst of applause came at the end of his informal remarks . The Secretary opened by stating that he had " no secrets " and that the Agriculture Department policy was not formed in an ivory tower to be dictated , to be handed down to the farmers . Then he noted the difficulties he believed to be involved in price support of live cattle . The cattle men remained quiet as he told them that so far he was inclined to believe the only feasible program for supporting cattle prices was the program now under way  --  that of buying canned beef made from lower grades and thus removing surplus stock from the market . He referred to past Federal efforts to put floors under perishable goods , citing the " dismal failure " of hog buying in 1943 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it can be done but it would be a terrible thing if we got into this program and found it would n't work . " It would be , he said , a " reflection on a great industry . " And he added that a plan for cattle " must not create more problems . " The Federal Government did not make direct purchases of live hogs during World War II , but a tremendous pig production forced the Government to appeal to farmers to hold back marketing their hogs early in 1944 because packers were unable to handle the output . The Government also was forced to resort to heavy purchases of canned pork products through various Federal mechanisms and send huge supplies abroad . Lard also became a problem . A large quantity spoiled and was dumped as inedible . From 1946 through 1950 , potatoes were under a support of 90 per cent , of parity . High production resulted in a loss to the Government of more than $500,000,000 . Quantities of potatoes were sprayed with blue dye to make them inedible and burned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for producers . The Commodity Credit Corporation , the Government 's price support agency , has had a net loss of approximately $1,100,000,000 in twenty years of operation . Of this amount , an estimated three-quarters has been lost on potatoes , eggs and dairy products . Cattle supports , Mr. Benson said , are not mandatory under farm law but are at the discretion of the Secretary , who must consider cer-. taro factors , including perishability and ability to dispose of the products . " It would not be , enough , to take the commodity , " he said . " You 've got to find a home for it . " The Secretary said he was encouraged about the immediate future and foresaw a degree of stabilization in the cattle market already . As he finished , Mr. Driscoll noted an exception to the stabilization remark . " Mr. Secretary , if that 's the only outlook we have , God help the cattle industry , " he said . The cattle men then rode the buses back to Legion Hall , where they continued to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls . " Let 's flex it up , " called out one cattle man . " Make it 90 to 110 per cent of parity . " The cattle men 's committee received suggestions for : alFtemoval of the present $10,000 limit on Federal economic disaster loans . 4A " comprehensive investigation " of the spread between the price of cattle on the hoof and the price to consumers . Use of Federal money to refinance cattle men with their local banks . ilThe use of local committees to decide whether a cattle man should have a loan of more than $50,000 instead of leaving such a loan to the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture , as now provided in a ' special livestock loan farm law . Senator Frank Carlson , Republican of Kansas and Administration adviser , urged tonight a stepped up Government beef purchase program that would entail removing 3,000,000 head of cattle from the market at an estimated cost of $500,000,000 . He said this meat could be sold abroad to countries with some money available to pay a part of the cost . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He mentioned Germany , Austria , Greece and the Near East in this connection . Received With Enthusiasm Senator Carlson urged the increased program at a night meeting of the cattle men . He was enthusiastically received as was Senator Lester C. Hunt , Democrat of Wyoming , who said he ' had urged the Agriculture Department to put a base under live cattle three , months ago as an experiment . " If it proves unsatisfactory , Congress can devise a better system , " he said . Senator Carlson said he had no specific plan for acquiring the beef except that it should come through normal domestic channels . His idea was to get what he considered 3,000,000 " surplus " head , or 1,500.000,000 pounds of lower grade meat , off the market to bolster prices . The Agriculture Department 's current beef buying program is geared to the disposal of 1,000,000 head of cattle , mainly low grade cows , through purchases of canned products from packers . Livestock producers have urged a build-up of this program , with suggestions from some Western producers ranging as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 , - 000,000 for beef purchases for overseas distribution . Will Urge Exports Senator Carlson said the overseas program would have a. " marked effect on our foreign relations because people in some of the countries need food and need it badly . " He declared that American livestock producers should get a fair share of American exports and " I 'm going to battle for it in the next Congress . " He intended to " insist " in the next session of Congress on a study of the relationship of international trade to the American farm economy , he said . Senator Carlson was asked by a cattle man why he did not get a foot in President Eisenhower 's door and get 90 per cent of parity price support on live cattle . The Senator replied that he was not sure how a price prop would work , although he was for price supports on storable commodities . He said he intended to do some " visiting " around the Agriculture Department and the White House to see what could be done . The National Farmers Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of Mr. Benson 's most caustic critics , was flying to Washington to address a luncheon meeting of the cattle men tomorrow .
