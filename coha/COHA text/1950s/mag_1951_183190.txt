Robert Neville , TIME 'S Bureau Chief in Hong Kong , runs a listening post-an ear trumpet on Red China 's coast . His job is to pick up each rumble and whisper from the mainland . He hears plenty of both . <P> Hong Kong is the neutral way station , the communications center , for almost any traveler , whatever his mission , who skirts the edge of China or passes through Mao 's bamboo curtain . Onto the British-held island and peninsula pour refugees from the Communist Utopia-in-reverse , agents and opportunists playing their own cautious angles ; through its postage-stamp airfield and its busy railway station pass most of the diplomats who scuttle to &; from Peking ; from its shrewd businessmen go goods for Communist buyers ; out of its newsstands and radio sets gush reams and hours of words from Mao 's propagandists-intended not for Western newsmen but for the 463 million Chinese whose every thought the Communists hope to control . Truth and half-truth are there in abundance . The problem is to evaluate , piece together and check reports against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exasperating job is digesting Communist newspapers , " literature " and broadcasts , with their wearisome load of Marxian cliches . Even the fine print must be studied , for it often tells the story which the headlines are designed to hide . For instance , Neville read a maze of Marxian dialectic about the Reds ' wonderful social security system ( " second only to Soviet Russia 's " ) before he found the catch : the scheme applied only to an insignificant number of workers and even for them it would be delayed . <P> Some of the most shocking news about Red China is deliberately spread and documented by the Chinese Reds themselves . The Communist papers are at their gleeful best in reporting mass killings of " counter-revolutionaries . " The present propaganda line attempts to scare peasants into submission , and so the Red journalist dwells on the gory details with all the morbid gusto of a tabloid reporter on a chorus girl murder . <P> Sickeningly similar stories are told by the hundreds of missionaries , businessmen and disenchanted Chinese who stream by thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assistants interview refugees by the hour , are able to follow much more than the march of the Red purge . They can watch trends such as the growing number of Russian " technicians " in China , the booming tax rate , the rocketing level of unemployment in specific industries . One student of transportation in Hong Kong was able to build up a timetable for trains throughout China . <P> Neville is a veteran of living on the edge of disaster . He was in Spain in 1936 when the Civil War broke out , in Warsaw in 1939 when the Nazis blitzed across the Polish border to start World War II . He has also followed gentler pursuits , e.g. , bridge expert for the New York Herald Tribune . During his newspaper career , he got his first good look at the East . He set off on a westward jaunt around the world in 1940 , reported the war 's effects on Free China and Hong Kong , took a look behind the Japanese lines , and , incidentally , had several interviews with TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
