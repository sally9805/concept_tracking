On a dusty road north of Seoul last week , a U.N . tank commander leaned against the tread of his bulky Patton and read an order to his men : " During the remainder of the armistice negotiations , every effort will be made to avoid casualties and to demonstrate our willingness to honor a cease-fire . " The lieutenant went on with specifications : no more combat patrols , artillery to be used only for counterbattery fire , the infantry to fight only to repel an attack . When he had finished , a sergeant asked : " What does this mean , lieutenant ? " Answered the officer : " It means just what it says . And it means that from now on every round of ammo has got to be accounted for . " <P> Bonfires , Ball Games , As the order was relayed to other units in similar fashion , an unearthly quiet enveloped the snowy front . Earlier , the Chinese Reds had celebrated the settlement of a tentative cease-fire line with a display of military fireworks-red , yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disregarding the usual front-line blackout , built bonfires . Through field glasses , U.N . troops could see them smoking cigarettes , drinking tea , playing volleyball . <P> A British patrol , poking into a dugout in no man 's land ( which the Chinese usually occupied by night , the British by day ) , stumbled across two grinning Chinese still there . Flustered but polite , the British backed off without either side firing a shot . When word of this reached the British brigadier , he exclaimed : " I 'll have to get instructions on this . After all , my chaps might have fired . Why , there might have been a diplomatic incident ! " <P> General Van Fleet 's headquarters had issued an order , the gist of which was : do n't shoot unless you are shot at . It would have been better if the Eighth Army commander had called U.N . newsmen in beforehand , and told them what he was doing instead of letting them draw their own conclusions from what they saw and heard at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Washington and Key West ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , did not trouble the men in the front lines . Using a bayonet to dig chunks of ham from a ration can , one G.I. sighed happily : " Man , this is pure heaven ! " <P> Army &; Air Targets . The air war in " MIG Alley " ( see below ) and U.N . air attacks on the enemy 's rear went on without letup . Van Fleet 's original order on ground activity was soon modified . Some allied artillery crews began firing at " any and all targets . " In one night , U.N . airmen sighted 9,700 enemy trucks rolling south toward the front , many of them with their headlights on for the sake of more speed . The airmen claimed to have destroyed 300 trucks , only a small fraction of the enemy traffic , the heaviest of the entire war . <P> What did the Red buildup portend ? There are two plausible deductions : 1 ) that the enemy expects a smashing U.N . offensive-if the truce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2 ) that he is mounting an offensive of his own . Despite the talk at Panmunjom and in the world 's capitals , all was not entirely quiet on the Korean front .
