txt A disaster plan for the medical profession in the event of atomic attack was issued , yesterday by Col. Lawrence Wilkinson , director of the New York State Civil Defense Commission . The plan shows that an attack on New York City , or any of the seven other target areas in the state , would strain every medical resource to care for an estimated 60,000 wounded and to bury the 60,000 dead from a single atomic bomb . It classifies the probable wounded as 27,000 severely burned , 13,000 with fractures , open wounds and ctushing injuries , 12,000 with severe shock , and 12,000 with radiation illness . Many of these would be suffering from two or more types of injury . A Problem of Logistics Colonel Wilkinson , who drew the plan in cooperation with Dr. Herman E. Hilleboe , State Commissioner of Health , described it as no effort to meet new and strange conditions , but one to solve a great problem in medical logistics . He said that radiation sickness was no problem to doctors , but that the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken area was one requiring not only plans but personnel and funds . In a letter to the 104 local civil defense directors in the state , he called upon them to start forth , with the enrollment and training of volunteer teams of nurses , nurses ' aides , medical assistants , stretcher bearers , messengers , record clerics and laboratory technicians . He described New York City as being in a better position than the seven other target areas in respect to medical personnel and such facilities as laboratories . But ' he emphasized that no community ' could stand alone in such a disaster . " No citizen of the State of New York , " he said , " can escape the responsibility for helping himself , his neighbor or the residents of another community in the event of an atomic attack . The demands upon medical and allied services will be greater than any yet met successfully in the world . " Emergency medical field services are more important than hospital care , because , if the former fails , the latter can not repair the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than a neurosurgeon arriving later . " Though the directive called for every community to expend its own funds initially and immediately in training volunteers and in stockpiling medical supplies Colonel Wilkinson indicated that the commission would ask the Legislature at once for large funds . Blood and blood products are described as the key to saving the wounded . The directive reveals plans for 230 centers throughout the state , at which emergency teams will receive blood and rush it to a target area . If the blood centers were properly organized , with nurses and technicians and apparatus as well as with lists of donors , Colonel Wilkinson believed that the 20,000 pints needed in the first six hours in a target area could be drawn and delivered . He said there must be a continuing program after the critical first six hours . Discussing the effects of shock , he said that battle experience showed that even a healthy young soldier suffering shock from wounds could not survive for eighteen hours if he received . neither treatment nor transfusions . In a general civil population including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of shock would occur in far fewer hours , and early treatment would save thousands of lives .. This , he said , illustrates the importance of Immediately training the non-medical personnel that would be needed to man the primary medical stations on the edge of the totally destroyed area , the clearing stations in the partly destroyed areas , the emergency hospitals farther out , and the remote hospitals to which the- wounded eventually would be removed . Bequirenienta Set Forth The wimary medical field units , according to the plan , will require one physician , one medical assistant ( dentist , veterinarian , etc. , ca. ' pable of dressing wounds , giving injections or medicine ) , two nurses , two nurses ' aides , one record clerk , eight stretcher bearers , four Inessengdra and a messenger leader . These would give ' such immediate attention as was necessary to save life or to transport wounded to emergency hospitals . The emergency hospital will require two physicians , one preferably skilled in major surgery , two medical assistants , fifteen nurses , thirty nurses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four messengers . These would be operated from a supply base , to be selected immediately , in each of five sectors around a target area . Back of these will be " the general hospitals , those in the target community to be evacuated of their regular patients , and ambulances , planes , hospital trains and hospital ships to move both classes of patients . Colonel Wilkinson urged that all local directors make up immediately their lists of professional men , assign the minimum necessary to care for the routine health needs of the community and organize the rest into mobile teams to be moved to the target area . Each team is expected to carry with it the necessary medical supplies to operate in the critical first six , hours . After that the state system of supply would be geared to meet needs as they . developed . He likewise urged local communities in non-target areas to begin ? at once the stockpiling of blood derivatives that could be stored . He recommended that they be stored near airports .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
