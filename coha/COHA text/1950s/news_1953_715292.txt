The money , according to Moretti 's version , as repeated by Mr. Parsons , was allegedly paid the Governor by Harold .1 . *Adonis , a former clerk in Mr. Driscoll 's offree . Adonis is now awaiting extradition in the Netherlands on a charge of common law bribery . . Apprised of the testimony , the Governor denied that he had received . bribes . He termed the Moretti allegation " ac completely false concoction " and-rhe " product of a demented imagination ; " Mr. Parsons was the sole witness at the committee 's public hearing , // which was resumed at 10 A. M. in the State Assembly chamber . . Reading from a prepared statement which he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Parsons sought to show that Mr. Stamler had consistently tried to obstruct the apprehension of Adonis and to block the indictment . However , under questioning by Augustus Studer , committee counsel , and committee members , he admitted what appeared to be laxity by his office in this case . He described an early morning meeting between himself and John Dickerson , Republican state chairman , on a Newark street corner late in 1950 . The two men walked around the ' Hock while Mr. Dickerson told of a visit by underworld characters to his Palisades Park home . He allegedly told Mr. Parsons that Willie Moretti , his brother Salvatore , and the racketeer Joe ( Joe Doto ) Adonis , no relative of Harold , had visited him one evening . $12,000 a Month Pay-off Charged On the visit , Mr. Dickerson reportedly said , Willie Moretti charged that Harold Adonis had received $12,000 a month for nineteen months from Bergen County gamblers , $10,000 of which he gave the Governor and the remainder of which he pocketed ..

The $228,000 allegedly paid to Adonis , the Attorney General said , was presumably for protection of gamblers in Bergen County . Mr. Parsons testified that he did not then and did not now believe that either the Governor or Mr. Stamler received any bribe money . For that reason , although he was and is the chief law enforcement officer in the state , he never sought to investigate either man nor inquire into their bank deposits or financial standings . In addition , he admitted that he never asked Mr. Dickerson to report their conversation to any law enforcement agency or to testify before any grand jury . At the same time he said that he reported the Moretti charges both to Mr. Stamler and Governor Driscoll within twenty-four hours after meeting Mr. Dickerson . He quoted Mr. Stamler as describing the chvges against him as " ridiculous " without foundation . State Police Head Called In The Attorney General went on to testify that both he and Mr. Stamler agreed that a disinterested party should inquire into the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police , was selected . Mr. Parsons asserted-that Colonel Schoeffel had enough evidence against Harold Adonis in April , 1951 , to indict him on bribery charges and sought to present this evidence to the grand jury . However , he went on , Mr. Stamler said he had other matters to be disposed of and the case was held over for a grand jury drawn up in the summer of 1952 . The indictment against Harold Adonis was eventually handed up in November , 1952 , just two years after the street corner meeting between Mr. Parsons and Mr. Dickerson . Mr. Parsons admitted that he did nothing to prevent the dismissal of the 1951 grand jury , although it had heard testimony concerning the bribes and he had enough evidence to warrant an indictment . His testimony also developed that Harold Adonis Bras in telephone communication with Mr. Dickerson between the time the latter talked with Mr. Parsons and Adonis left the country . Asked by Mr. Studer if the bribery charges came as a shock to him , Mr. Parsons replied : " No , " explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , he took no stock in the charges . ( Mr. Parsons presumably referred to Moretti 's testimony before the Kefauver Senate Crime Investigating Committee , but this testimony was not made until several weeks after his meeting with Mr. Dickerson . ) The Attorney General went on to charge that Mr. Stamler wrote a letter to Harold Adonis ' attorney in the Netherlands describing the case as purely a matter of politics . This letter , he declared , has materially helped to delay the extradition of Adonis . The public hearings will be resumed at 10 A. M. Wednesday at which time Mr. Parsons is expected to end his testimony . Mr. Stamler will be the next witness .
