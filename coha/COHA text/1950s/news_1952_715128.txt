Crane , former president of the Uniformed Firemen 's Association , that he was present at Gracie Mansion in OcItober , 1949 , when Mr. Crane allegedly handed Mr. O'Dwyer a manila envelope containing $10,000 . Last Thursday , District Attorney Frank S. Hogan sought to have Mr. Finkelstein cited for contempt on the ground that he made " willful and unlawful refusals to answer proper and legal interrogations " In the grand-jury investigation . Court Reserves Decision Yesterday , Mr. Hogan 's chief . aide in the racket bureau , Assistant District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris B. Steinberg , sub- ' mitted extensive briefs and supplemented the memoranda with oral arguments . At the conclusion of the hearing Judge Valente reserved decision . It was while Mr. Scotti was ' enumerating his reasons why he thought Mr. Finkelstein should be cited for contempt that he averred in open court for the first time that Mr. O'Dwyer was a target in the present  --  inquiry . He told Judge Valente the grand jury was seeking to determine if there had been violations of Sections 774 and 776 of the Penal Law and of Sections 321 , 322- and 323 of the Election Law . He said that the grand jury also was trying to ascertain " whether Mr. Crane or Mayor O'Dwyer , who were witnesses before the grand jury , committed the crime of perjury . " " Section 774 relates to political contributions made by a municipal employe . Section 776 covers the failure to file with the Board of Elections statements of all such contributions . The sections of the Election Law spell out the violations . Both Sections 774 and 776 are misdemeanors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 fines , or both . Perjury is listed in the Penal Law as a felony and carries , on conviction , a prison term up to five years , a $5,000 fine , or both . &Dwyer; Stands on Denial Mr ' . O'Dwyer , , reached in Mexico City and informed of Mr. Scotti 's statement in court , said he would make " no further comment . " Last week , when asked to comment on the prosecutor 's move against Mr. Finkelstein , the former Ambassador said : " I have denied it . I have nothing further to say . Nothing . " Mr. Scotti , seeking to bolster his charge that Mr. Finkelstein was balking the grand jury 's inquiry , cited five specifications as the basis for his contention . The specifications were : ( 1 ) Mr. Crane 's ' visit to the Finkelstein apartment on Oct. 10 , 1949 ; ( 2 ) Mr. crane and Mr. Finkelstein 's entering an- automobile parked at Ninety - sixth Street and Park Avenue ; ( 3 ) their being driven to Gracie ' Mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) whether the witness saw a manila envelope in Mr. Crane 's possession , and ( 5 ) whether the witness saw Mr. Crane alone with Mayor O'Dwyer on the porch of Gracie4Mansion . ? Mr. Steinberg denied his client had been " equivocal " in his replies to questions before the grand jury . He declared that on the principal point  --  knowledge , indication or discussion with Mr. Crane or anyone else of the 510,000 contribution ? Mr. Finkelstein had testified " unequivocally , clearly and without hesitation . " Mr. Scotti said the witness had a " calculated and cunning tendency to duck , dodge and protest and often to indulge in self-serving declarations . " Asserting that Mr. Finkelstein had told the grand ljurors he had " no motive to withhold information from , the panel , " Mr. Steinberg said his client was an innocent man who happened to get in the - way , and that because he was at the mansion every day during the 1949 campaign " he was the natural person for Crane to pick on to sing his Third Man theme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mer Mayor to ' be sulking down there in Mexico when this thing is being investigated , " the lawyer continued . He said the former Ambassador " owed " it to the people to come forward and testify . Court Asks for Answer It was at the conclusion of that oral arguments that Judge Valente , addressing Mr. Steinberg , said he would be interested in hearing Mr. Finkeistein 's answer to a question that contained the five specifications . Mr. Finkelstein throughout the hearing , had been an interested listener in the first row of the spectator 's seats . Mr. Steinberg looked back at his client and then turned to the court : " I will give you the best answer to that . I will put Jerry Finkelstein on the stand , swear him and ask him that question . " With Mr. Finkelstein on the stand , Mr. Steinberg summed up the question as follows : " Do you , or do you not , remember , or can you say , that on or about Oct. 10 , 1949 , a man named Crane came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in or rang the doorbell  --  and waited , or did n't wait ; that he went with you to a car at the corner of Ninetysixth Street and Park Avenue ; that you then got into that car with Crane ; that there was a man in the front seat driving it who had a hearing aid ; that he drove to Gracie Mansion , that when you got to Gracie Mansion you got out of the car ; that the man with the hearing aid went back to the box where a policeman was ; that Sloan Simpson ( the present Mrs. O'Dwyer ) was sitting in a car near the porch he mentioned ; that you spoke to Sloan Simpson in view of the porch ; that you turned around and looked , or whatever else the facts were ; that you saw Crane on that porch in solitary conversation with O'Dwyer , and that after you got back into the car and they drove you to the Commodore Hotel ? can you say that , yes or no ? " Mr. Finkelstein replied : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Steinberg and Mr. Scotti immediately got into a wrangle as to whether the prosecutor was trying " to browbeat " the witness , but the court ordered . Mr. Steinberg to continue . The attorney then asked the witness : " Did that happen , that sequence of events as I have recited it to you , yes or no ? " " Well , there 's five questions there , " protested Mr. Finkelstein . " Do n't argue , " retorted his attorney . " Do n't fence with me now . I am asking , did that happen ? " " No , " he responded . The ? court stenographer , - Louis Frank , repeated the question as Mr. Scotti started his interrogation and Mr. Finkelstein requested a repetition . Mr. Finkelstein then asked : " I have to answer one question for that entire proceeding ? " Advised he would have to do that , Mr. Finkelstein was then asked if " that particular sequence of events * S * did happen ? " " I do n't recall that happening , no . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question again , and asked the witness : " You say unequivocally that these events as recited by the court and now incorporated in my question , never happened ? " " They never happened , " Mr. Finkelstein replied . Judge Valente also went over the sequence of events and , addressing the witness , inquired : " You say it did not happen , is that correct ? " " That 's right . " " Now , I ask you this question , " continued Judge Valente . " Did you in the month of October , 1949 , go to Gracie Mansion with Mr. Crane for the purpose of Mr. Crane 's making a cash contribution to Mr. O'Dwyer ? " " Absolutely not , " answered Mr. Finkelstein . Mr. Steinberg renewed a motion to have the contempt citation dismissed , but the court reserved decision . In the brief submitted by Mr. Steinberg , stress was placed on the testimony given by Mr. Crane when he appeared on March 21 , 1951 , before the Senate Crime Investigating Committee . The fireman told the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansion to see Mr. O'Dwyer . " Whether or not Crane gave O'Dwyer money , I absolutely do not know , " Mr. Finkelstein said in the sworn statement . " I never saw such a transaction . I never knew Of such a transaction . " I never discussed slick a transaction . Furthermore , I testified unequivocally to that fact before a ' grand jury , emphatically and repeatedly . " Mr. Steinberg 's brief cited various excerpts from the grand jury minutes to substantiate Mr. Finkelstein 's contention . In one legal point against a contempt citation , the lawyer contended that any criminal action for contempt would have to be based on an examination of the witness ' own testimony rather than in weighing evidence against evidence . The brief pointed out that Mr. Finkelstein , the publisher of The Civil Service Leader , had been praised by Governor Dewey for his " accomplishments and civic service . " It also noted that his work on the City Planning Commission had been the subject of " appreciative editorials " in THE NEW YORK TIMES and The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
