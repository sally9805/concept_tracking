For reasons uniquely British . Budget Day is the House of Commons ' most festively expectant annual occasion , signaling the power of the purse , which raised the House to supreme authority in Britain . Some M.P.s arrived soon after dawn , hours before the Chancellor of the Exchequer was due to show up carrying the battered dispatch case used by Gladstone and by every Chancellor since . A few Tory traditionalists wore black silk toppers . Sir Winston Churchill , who attended his first Budget Day in 1901 , beamed from his bench below the gangway , sporting a huge red geranium in his lapel . <P> This year the Chancellor , whose single pronouncement could make millions of Britons richer or poorer , was Peter Thorneycroft , 47 , a smooth , somewhat over-groomed son of a Tory ironmaster . On his first budget outing , Thorneycroft kept to the traditions by droning a prosaic prognosis of the nation 's economic health until 4:30 , the hour the Stock Exchange closed . Then , safe at last to let his secrets out , the youthful-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's tax setup . <P> Time to Relax . Instead of last year 's $812 million surplus , Thorneycroft foresaw a whopping $1.5 billion operating surplus from buoyant tax returns and the big savings in defense . He intended to pass out $275 million at once in tax relief . Brushing aside fearful warnings of inflation , he said : " The answer to an over stretched economy is not to tax it but to relax it . " He freed firms doing business abroad from all taxes on their overseas trading operations , removed some unpopular domestic levies , e.g. , the 1955 " pots and pans " tax and the " Suez shilling " on gasoline , lowered others and granted graduated income-tax exemptions for children to help their parents pay higher school bills . But Thorneycroft 's boldest move was to single out for relief the 300,000 Britons-mostly engineers , executives , scientists-who earn more than 2,000 ( $5,600 ) a year and therefore pay a surtax on top of their regular income tax . It was the first break surtax payers have had since 1920 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society which we seek to create there should always be room at the top . " <P> Three Years to Grow . Such welfare-state heresy started a sharp fisc fight . " The richer a man is the more he gets under this budget , ' ' cried Labor 's Harold Wilson . " One of its principal virtues , " answered the Tory Telegraph . <P> Actually , the Tory gentry with inherited wealth did not gain from Thorneycroft 's budget . Its incentives were all directed at the rising middle class , which has contributed so many valuable men to the long lines of emigrants leaving for Australia and Canada . Conservative M.P.s flocked around Thorneycroft afterward with a kind of locker-room enthusiasm unseen in House of Commons lobbies in several years . Said one , noting that Thorneycroft was hanging on to most of his surplus : " If things turn out well , he can give more next year and even more the year after that . Remember , the year after that will be election year . " Prime Minister Harold Macmillan agreed . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the last of our three victory budgets will be better than the first . "
