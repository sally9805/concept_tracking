At first glance , the Lehigh Valley Railroad 's report to its employees gave stockholders cause for cheer last week . Lehigh had grossed $80,009,497 and netted $7,205,179 last year , compared to a $5,846,985 net in 1951 . Furthermore , said President C. A. Major , since 1948 the road had cut its $135 million debt down to $79,500,000 , and had exchanged all its coal-burning locomotives for diesels . But the new equipment , Major explained , had cost some $23 million , which Lehigh will have to pay off at the rate of $3,000,000 a year . Because every cent Lehigh made in 1952 ; was plowed back into the road , President Major was forced to add to his good-year report some news all too familiar to Lehigh 's long-patient shareholders ' 1952 is therefore the 21st successive year in which the stockholders have received no return whatever .
