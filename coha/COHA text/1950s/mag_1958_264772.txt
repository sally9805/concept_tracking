THE CONGRESS Breach in the Line <P> Gathering forces for a surprise attack on the Administration 's stand-pat tax bill last week , Florida 's handsome Senator George Smathers found plenty of allies from the South and West . A top Capitol Hill specialist in transportation affairs , Smathers wanted to kill off the $700 million-a-year federal transportation taxes-3% on freight , 10% on passenger tickets , 4% on pipelined oil , 4 a ton on coal shipments . And the South and West had long been grumbling that the freight tax discriminates unfairly against states far removed from the big-city markets and industrial centers . <P> With bipartisan support behind him , Smathers last week breached the Administration 's previously undentable no-tax-cut line . By sturdy majorities , the Senate nailed the Smathers amendments to the House-passed Administration bill to extend for another year , at present rates , the corporation and excise taxes scheduled to shrink on July 1 . But that was all the tax trimming the Senate did . It voted down a flurry of tax-cut proposals , passed the Smathers-nicked Administration bill with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House-Senate conference to decide whether the House , which approved a hold-the-line bill with no exceptions , will stand still for the Smathers amendments .
