Ulmer Turner , a Chicago news analyst with an expensive hobby , has been hearing some strange sounds lately out of Radio Moscow . Soviet propaganda . Turner reports , is getting a soft pedal . The time devoted to Russian music ( especially Rimsky-Korsakov ) is increasing , the announcers are sprouting Oxford accents , and a Big Ben touch has been added : " We pause now while you hear the clock in the Kremlin strike midnight . " Turner does not claim to know the significance of these facts , but it is just the kind of information he has long wanted to give his listeners first hand . Last week he got his chance to " broaden the scope of newscasting " with a new Turner Calling show on Chicago 's ABC station WENR . The program gives him 15 minutes five nights a week to season his news and commentary with tape-recorded samplings of the world 's propaganda . His sponsor : Hallicrafters Co. , a manufacturer of short-wave and other communications equipment . <P> The Folksy Touch . As one of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : W9UG ) , Turner operates a mass-production listening post in a barn next to his suburban Northbrook home . With the help of a technician , three 35-foot directional antenna masts , eleven short-wave receivers ( six are permanently tuned to catch Moscow , London , Paris , Seoul , Buenos Aires and Melbourne ) and three tape recorders , he collects most of the short-wave signals aimed at the U.S. <P> Confident that a watchful ear can pick up real news beats , Turner listens for statements of government policy , reports on domestic affairs in other countries , and foreign attitudes about America ( on Radio Sofia , " you actually hear them calling us louses " ) . Most of all , he tries to keep up with the latest Communist line for his program . " Listeners for years have heard commentators discuss Red propaganda , " he says , " but very few have heard it as it comes in English direct from Moscow . " Whenever he can , Turner juxtaposes the facts of a situation as he knows it with the Soviet version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts on the Soviet superbomb , it is not all somber stuff . He points out that Radio Moscow , for reasons of its own , goes in for such novelties as the American folk song All God 's Chillun Got Wings , sung in phonetic English by Russian schoolchildren ( " They are just trying to be folksy , " he believes ) . <P> The Big Scoop . Newsman Turner , 52 , picked his first radio message out of the air during his boyhood days in South Carolina by stringing wires between the tall pines in his parents ' backyard . He worked for a while as a professional wireless operator on ships plying the Pacific . Later , when he became a reporter for Hearst 's Chicago Herald &; Examiner , he set up a ham set in the city room . When police captured Public Enemy John Dillinger in 1934 and refused to tell newsmen the whereabouts and time of arrival of the plane carrying him from Tucson to Chicago , Turner was the man behind the big scoop . He caught the pilot 's radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chitchat about Dillinger . " The Herald &; Examiner 's reporters were right there waiting when they came in , " he recalls .
