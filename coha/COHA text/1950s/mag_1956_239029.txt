THE two-week-old steel strike has brought the question from some laymen : Why not arbitrate ? Instead of settling the dispute by force , let industry and union turn the dispute over to an expert , impartial arbitrator who would make a binding decision on the basis of facts . <P> While such a solution sounds reasonable , most arbitration experts flatly say that it makes little sense . Arbitration is an aid to collective bargaining , not a substitute for it . As Houston Transit Co . President Carl Frazier puts it : " You simply can not , in effect , turn over the authority for managing the company to a third party who may not be nearly as familiar with the company 's problems as you are . " Once an agreement is signed , however , arbitration may come into its rightful role , interpreting the fine print , settling the petty grievances that might otherwise erupt into strikes . <P> As a result , arbitration has grown into one of the most useful lubricants in the U.S. economy , not only facilitating industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With contracts increasing in number and complexity , and courtrooms increasingly jammed with work , arbitration has become a practical necessity . Not a new idea ( the Romans wrote it into the Justinian Code ) , arbitration got its big impetus in World War II , when the Government , plagued by quickie strikes , insisted on labor-arbitration clauses in all defense-production contracts . Today nine out of ten union agreements provide for arbitration , and hundreds of thousands of organizations and corporations have arbitration clauses in their contracts . Calls for arbitrators from major arbitration sources have increased 13% in the past year alone . <P> The great fountainhead of arbitration is the nonprofit American Arbitration Association , founded 30 years ago with the help of Charles Evans Hughes , Herbert Hoover and Banker Felix Warburg . With a $500.000 budget , mostly contributed by large corporations , plus modest fees ( $25 per day in labor cases , from one-tenth of 1% to 1.5% of the disputed amount in commercial cases ) , dedicated A.A.A.ers handle about 2,500 disputes a year , 80% of them labor cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing room . <P> As soon as two disputants agree to arbitrate , the A.A.A. sends each a list of experts selected from its 13,000-man master panel , ascertains the man most acceptable to both sides , then sets the hearing . Average elapsed time from appeal to award : 70 days ( two hours in one emergency ) v. two to three years for a final court decision . A fur dispute that had dragged on for six weeks in a New York court and cost $9,000 in litigation fees ended up with a hung jury . Brought to the A.A.A. , it was settled in five days . Cost : $507 . Arbitration can also be expensive . Settling the cases of 226 workers discharged for " misconduct " during the 1955 Southern Bell Telephone strike cost an estimated $2,000,000 . <P> One of the greatest advantages of an A.A.A. hearing over a court session is the expertness of the arbitrator . Unlike a judge , who might have to spend weeks acquainting himself with the technical points of an industry , the arbitrator , usually a topnotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can start right in with the facts in dispute .
