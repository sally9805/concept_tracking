" Bing brought it off beautifully , " reported the society editor of the New York Daily News . She was referring to the social glitter of the Metropolitan Opera 's opening night , but the judgment was just as applicable to the business onstage . With Don Carlo for an opener ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) , new General Manager Rudolf Bing had handsomely kept his promise to bring operatic productions up to date . Furthermore , he had made money doing it . An audience of 4,000 had packed the big house ( paying a $36 top ) to give him the biggest opening-night gross ( after taxes ) in Met history : more than $50,000. * Over his first hurdle with thoroughbred ease , later last week Rudi Bing settled down to running the rest of the race . <P> His second opera was also a completely rebuilt production : Wagner 's romantic The Flying Dutchman , which had not been staged at the Met in ten years . As he had for Verdi 's Don Carlo , Bing went to Broadway for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Iceman Cometh ) Jones . Conductor Fritz Reiner polished cast and orchestra until they shone . If The Dutchman was less of a triumph than Don Carlo , it was mainly because Wagner had given the Met less of a grand opera to work with than Verdi had . <P> The inspiration for The Dutchman came to Wagner during a seasick voyage in a small sailboat through the Baltic to <P> London . His second successful opera , it was based on the legend of a Dutch captain condemned by the Devil to sail the seas until judgment day , unless , in brief excursions ashore every seven years , he could find a woman who would be faithful until death . The ghostly Dutchman finds his woman in the second act , but without giving operatic stage directors much lively theater business to go on . <P> The Met 's singers did their best to make up for all that . For U.S.-trained Astrid Varnay , The Dutchman was a chance to prove again that she really belongs at the top , and opulent-voiced Soprano Varnay ( as Senta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 ( the Dutchman ) , it was a brilliant debut . A onetime choir director with a big , barreling but expressive voice , huge ( 6 ft. 4 , 223 Ibs. ) , handsome Baritone Hotter filled the stage , both vocally and visually . <P> The Met 's next new production , due in December : Johann Strauss 's Die Fledermaus , staged by Broadway and Hollywood 's topnotch director , Garson Kanin . <P> <P> * One unbudgeted item of last-minute expense : in a gesture of good fellowship and good showmanship , Bing ordered 100 cups of afternoon coffee served to a sidewalk queue that had lined up for standing-room tickets .
