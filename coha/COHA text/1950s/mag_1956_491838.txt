Ballplayers Are as Good as Ever They were saying it when I went to my first major-league training camp with the Detroit Tigers forty years ago . " A-a-h , you do n't know what smart , hustling baseball is . You should 've seen the old Baltimore Orioles , " manager Hughey Jennings told the Tigers , including Ty Cobb . When I won a regular job on the Washington Senators in 1920 , I got the same earful from Clyde Milan , who had stolen eighty-eight bases in 1912 . " This crazy swinging for homers is ruining the game , " he grumbled . " Any clown with muscles can make . . the big leagues nowadays . You kids would n't have lasted long enough for a cup of coffee when I broke in as a rookie . " In all the years I 've been associated with baseball , I ca n't remember a period when old-timers did n't bemoan the quality of the players following them . It 's high time someone challenged the phony propaganda insinuating that current players arc collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the brand of baseball on display now . As the dean of major-league managers  --  this will be my twenty-ninth season ? I 'm as well qualified as anyone to compare today 's players with my contemporaries in the I 920 's , the so-called golden age of baseball . The caliber of play now unquestionably is as high as it was then . I 'll go out on a limb and say there are more good , first-class players today than ever before . They arc superior to the old-timers in two departments of the game , and equal in two others . Their one apparent deficiency is traceable more to different strategy than to lack of ability . In this article I 'll bring out a gimmick that helped to inflate batting averages years ago . I 'll show that Ted Williams , Stan Musial , Joe DiMaggio and others of this era are up there with the big guns of the past . Critics who sneer at anything under .350 arc ignorant of the tremendous development in the science of pitching . I 'm convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had conniption fits , and considerably lower averages , had they faced the variety of trick stuff the boys throw today . I was a pretty fair second baseman ? I still hold the record for most put-outs in one sea- son ? but the slickest fielders and double-play combinations of my time could n't match the brilliance of the defensive artists on all clubs now . There has been a sharp decline in base stealing ? but not base running  --  for the identical reason that horseshoeing is a dying skill . The home run , like the automobile , is a more efficient vehicle than old Dobbin for getting home in a hurry . As for competitive spirit , those yarns you 've read about the old firebrands are exaggerated myths . The boys today fight just as hard to win . Let 's take time out briefly to consider the sensational improvements in technique and performance in other sports during the last decade . Every time you pick up a paper it seems that a world record in track and field has been broken . Football teams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base ; the other day I read that the pros kick over 95 per cent of their points after touchdown . The winning scores in major golf tournaments are sometimes twenty strokes under Bobby Jones ' cards a quarter of a century ago . I do n't presume to he an authority on every sport in the book , but I can pass as something more than a half-baked expert in another game besides baseball . When I was appointed manager of the Washington Senators in I had a bigger reputation in basketball than in baseball . In fact , basketball was my springboard to the major leagues . I played semipro baseball around Pittston , Pennsylvania , without getting a tumble from scouts , but Hughey Jennings saw me in a basketball game and gave me a trial with the Tigers on the strength of my drive and hall handling . I played in the top pro ) basketball circuits for eight years against such stars as Holman , Beckman , Dehnert , Inglis and Sedran . Great as they were , they could n't come close to duplicating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands to reason that baseball has kept pace with the progress made in other sports . No game has been studied and analyzed more thoroughly . Baseball never was morepopular . The next time you pass a sand lot , notice how many kids arc aping the mannerisms of big-leaguers they 've seen on TV . All-round college and high-school athletes with pro potential in more than one sport generally choose baseball , because it offers the best salaries and longest career . Above all , improved coaching on every level is producing better ballplayers . My own experience underscores the conmast between past and present grooming of rookies for the major leagues . I spent four years in the minors and never got a tip on making the most difficult maneuver in the business , the second baseman 's pivot on a double play . Although shortstop is the toughest all-round position , the second baseman does have it harder on double-play relays , since he must co-ordinate tricky footwork with a blind throw . The shortstop sees the action in front of him and can sidestep the sliding runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play , making him a sitting duck for getting belted into left field before he can wheel for his throw . A sand-lotter invariably runs off second base and takes two steps toward the mound before relaying the ball to first , to avoid getting spilled by the runner . As he gets into faster ( Continued on Page 78 ) ( Continued from Page 76 ) company , those extra steps cost him double plays , and he must learn to pivot on the bag and take his lumps , or pay his way into the ball park . Most kids need several years of practice to perfect this , but the pivot is a basic play in basketball , and I had the knack down pat by the time I went to the Senators ' training camp in 1920 . It was my chief asset , and I took full advantage of it while trying to help Jimmy O'Neill , a buddy who lived in Minooka , Pennsylvania , seven miles from Pittston , my home town . Jimmy , kid brother of Steve O'Neill , the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was scared stiff he 'd be shipped to the minors on the first bounce if Clark Griffith knew he had a sore arm . On the long train ride to Tampa , Florida , I concocted a little scheme to cover up Jimmy 's lame flipper . He was a shortstop , and I figured we 'd be paired off in infield workouts . I told Jimmy I 'd yell " Get two ! " on all grounders hit to him , so he could nurse his arm by shoveling the ball to me underhand . Those phantom double plays we reeled off in practice did more good for me than Jimmy . His arm betrayed him as soon as games started , but my pivoting was so unusual for a rookie that it clinched the job for me . Today , rookies in the deepest bush get intensive schooling in the pivot and every other facet of the game . All this yapping about the scarcity of talented rookies is hogwash . We 're looking at a rich crop of fine young players , a statement supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cleveland freshman , averaged better than one strike-out an inning last year , a phenomenal achievement never approached by Walter Johnson or any other pitcher working as much as 200 innings in a season . Willie Mays and my boy , Al Kalinc , won batting championships as sophomores , a feat that defied Cobb , Wagner and Hornsby . A good shortstop who hits fifteen homers a season is worth his weight in uranium , even with the rabbit ball now in use . Ernie Banks , the Cubs ' sophomore , whacked forty-four homers last year . Do n't let anyone tell you these kids would n't have been standouts years ago ; and that also goes for Padres , Mantle , Conley , Virdon , Hoeft , Aaron and Sullivan . When old-timers talk about how great players flourished during the first quarter of the century , they refer chiefly to ten superstars  --  Babe Ruth , Ty Cobb , Tris Speaker , Honus Wagner , Rogers Hornsby , George Sisler , Cy Young , Walter Johnson , Christy Mathewson and Grover Cleveland Alexander . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who compiled records that seem beyond the reach of modem players . My sole objective is to upgrade the moderns by showing that the best of them deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with the old superstars . Sure , Cobb wound up twenty-four years in the American League with a lifetime average of .367 , a figure no one has equaled for a single season since 1948 . And Bob Feller 's 266 victories look awfully puny next to Young 's SII , and Johnson 's 411. 1 still insist , though , that a valid comparison can be made . Furthermore , the proportion of sup  --  rstars is as high as it ever was . The ten all-time greats covered a span of forty-seven years , from Young 's debut in 1890 to Hornsby 's retirement in 1937 . The last twenty years have produced Williams , Feller , Musial , DiMaggio and Roberts . Earlier in the story I said I would demonstrate that the old batting averages were on the inflated side . This is why . Between 1908 and 1930 , the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it counted as a sacrifice whenever a hitter unloaded a fly ball that scored a man from third or advanced a runner to second or third . There 's no way of calculating how many times that happened in individual cases , because the records in those days did n't distinguish between sacrifice flies and sacrifice bunts . They were all lumped together as " sacrifice hits . " Then in 1931 , the rule was changed and every batted ball except a sacrifice bunt was charged as an official time at bat . This is the hidden squeeze on the records of modern players . In 1999 , and again in 1954 and 1955 , the sacrifice-fly bonus was partially restored to the hitters . Under the present rule , it has to be a run-scoring fly to qualify as a sacrifice . They do keep the bunts and flies separate in today 's statistics . Last year the ten leading hitters in each major-league averaged about five sacrifice flies apiece . That hardly seems important enough to warrant attention , but it can make a difference of about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If flies that moved runners to second and third were also counted , the difference probably would be as much as four or even five points . If it were possible to adjust all career batting averages to equalize the differences the sacrifice-fly rule has brought about , some of the moderns would be higher on the all-time roll . As it is , two of them , Williams and Musial , are up there in the first ten among all the players who began their careers in this century and had more than ten years as big-league regulars : I 'm confident that Musial would be No. 5 if the adjustment I spoke of could be made . Anyway , no apologies have to be given for the class of ballplayers seen during a period in which two men , Williams and Musial , have nailed down such high ranking among the hitters of this century . Joe DiMaggio happens to be in the top twenty also , with a .925 mark . Keep in mind , too , that Mays , Kaline , Ashburn , Mantle and Snider may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't forget that statistics make no allowance for a severe handicap to modern players . NVorld War II , Korea and the draft have been taking big bites out of careers for fifteen years , a complication that never confronted players in other eras . The only Hall of Famers who missed more than two months of play during World War I were Alexander , Rabbit Maranville and Herb Pennock , and they were out one season . World War II put a really big crimp in the records of men like Williams , DiMaggio , Feller , Greenberg , Mize , Keller and Reiser . What figured to be the best years of their baseball lives were spent in the armed forces . In the case of Williams , it 's entirely possible the five seasons he lost at his peak cost him recognition as the greatest hitter who ever lived . He holds that distinction in my book . His career was interrupted by two long military hitches , and then these last two years he missed spring training and had to start from scratch against pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had a ten-inch steel pin in his shoulder , yet he hit .345 and .956 . The man is an authentic wonder , if ever there was one . The edge Cobb and Hornsby hold on paper over Williams is canceled out , in my opinion , by the vast improvement in pitching technique in recent years . Old-timers who criticize the decline in place hitting and base stealing have a legitimate beef , but they make ridiculous noises when they sound off about pitching . They never saw the variety of stuff hitters must contend with today . One new pitch in common use now , the slider , would have shaved ten to twenty points a year off batting averages in the old days . The slider , combined with other refinements , explains why there has been only one .400 average  --  by Williams in 1941 ? during the last quarter century . It may well be that no one will hit .400 fur another twenty-five years , if then . The basic principle in the art of pitching is to throw the ball at varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more deliveries a pitcher has in his repertory , the rougher he is on the hitters . You can hear a lot about the doctored pitches they used to throw years ago , such as the spitter and the licorice , slippery elm and shine balls . Actually , those deliveries were so hard to control that very few pitchers ever used them . Ninety per cent of all pitcher+ in the old days threw nothing but fast balls and curves , and in the clutch they invariably came down the middle with a fast ball . Nowadays , rookies fresh out of the minors have three or four different pitches , and they do n't hesitate to shoot for the corners with screwballs and knucklers on three-and-two counts . I had the privilege of playing with and managing Walter Johnson , winner of more American League games than any other titan in history . My awe for him has not diminished since that day in August , 1919 , when I made my big-league debut behind him . I 'd sooner hock the world-championship rings I won as manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than disparage Johnson , the ace of the staff that set inc up in the masterminding business . To me , the most incredible part of Johnson 's record is that he won the bulk of his 414 games with one pitch , a fast ball , He was just beginning to develop a dinky curve , after thirteen years iu the majors , when I first saw him . In his prime , Johnson 's speed must have been fantastic . I never thought it was possible for a man to throw harder than Bob Feller , but Clark Griffith always said Johnson was faster . accept that verdict and concede that Johnson was one pitcher in a million . It 's inconceivable , though , that anybody else could get by today with one meal ticket . Hitters dig in and murder guys who do not keep them guessing . If the truth must be known , pitchers in grandpa 's time were n't very resourceful . The fadeaway made Christy Mathewson famous a half century ago , but nobody copied it until Carl Hubbell revived it as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckler , a ball that nutters unpredictably . Good knuckle-ball specialists like Eddie Rommel , Freddy litzsinunons and Dutch Leonard used In be rarities , but most staffs today have at least one relief pitcher who throws the knuckler , When the spitter and the other pitches which involved doctoring the ball were banned in 1950 , few pitchers tried to find bread-and-butter substitutes . George L'hIc and George Blacholder fooled around with something called the slider , but it disappeared when they left the American League . Six years ago the slider suddenly popped up out of nowhere , and now it is standard equipment for fully half the pitchers in both leagues . Thr slider is extremely effective because it is released with a big motion like a last ball , but skids across the corner of the plate and throws the hitter off balance . The process was repeated a few years ago with the palm ball , also called the slip pitch and " the poor man 's knuckler , " featured by Waite Hoyt , the old Yankee . Pitchers like Jim Konstanty and Harry Dorish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  proved how effective it could be , and now it is another headache for hitters . As for the change of pace , that was an old dodge when Connie Mack was a boy , but I never saw it used to better advantage than in the last World Series . It was the pay-off pitch in the games won by Pod me , Ford and Byrne . I can see a question coming . if pitchers today are so all-fired smart , how come nobody has won thirty games a season since Dizzy Dean turned the trick in 1034 ? Frankly , that 's a tough nut to crack . All I can say is that the feat ' Oust be impossible under present conditions if Bob Feller never won thirty games a year . Feller was as great a pitcher as I , and maybe anyone , ever saw . When Feller enlisted in the Navy four days after Pearl Harbor , he had already won 107 major-league games , more than any twenty-threeyear-old pitcher in the Notary of baseball , Cy Young had nine victories at twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander was n't even in the big-time . Feller won twenty-five games in 1041 , then picked tip where he had left off , with twenty-six upon his return in 10,13. think it 's reasonable to assume he wrath ! have registered a minimum of 100 more decisions if it had n't been for the war . Add 100 game. ; to his 266 and he 'd be up there with Alexander and Mathewson , who won 373 , and within nodding distance of Johnson 's al F. Furthermore , Feller and the other modern pitching stars have had to buck pressures which would have cut yesterdays giants down to their size . I 'm talking about that familiar whipping boy , the home run . Before Babe Ruth and the rabbit ball revolutionized the game , only one or two men on a club could break up a tight battle with one swipe of the bat . Now , with almost everyone in the line-up a threat to knock a careless toss into the bleachers , a pitcher must bear down all the way to escape with his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time and the present is the influence of the home run on hitters . The lively ball was introduced in the American League the year I broke in , and it really was first cousin to the rabbit . Although homers were belted by the bushel , I did n't catch the fever because I knew my limitations as a slugger . I hit eleven homers in twelve years  --  including a cheap pair which dropped into temporary bleachers and helped to win 4-3 games from the Giants in the 192+ World Series  --  and each one came as a stunning surprise to me . I never tried to hit a ball out of the park , but today I 'd go up there swinging from the end of the stick like the rest of the boys . It 's the home-run hitters who get the biggest salaries . Take a quick look at the distribution of victories among starting and relief pitchers on a staff , and you 'll understand why aces no longer win games by the hatful . Formerly , managers allowed starters to hang on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-rater from the bull pen . Besides , going the nine-inning route was a comparative breeze . Pitchers often threw as few as ninety balls a game , and had to sweat out only a few jams . Today , a man working carefully to prevent hitters from lowering the boom on him makes via pitches a game . It 's no wonder managers are lifting starters at the first sign of distress and leaning heavily on the most important specialist in the business  --  the relief pitcher . Some sources credit me with pioneering this strategy . Firpo Marberry , whose great relieving was the key to the Senators ' pennant in 192+ , made me look like a dandy little mastermind , but I 've got to admit I picked up the idea from the Yankees ' Miller Huggins , and was lucky enough to have Marberry , a gent with a rubber arm , on the payroll . When you 've been watching big-league baseball for forty years , as I have , you take basic skills , like good fielding , for granted . However , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did some research in old fielding records . It was an exercise I do n't recommend to fans with illusions about the legendary old-timers . The book says the best defensive players of the past were clucks compared to present-day fancy Dans . ' Take Honus Wagner , paragon of shortstops , always the unanimous choice for the position on the all-time team . In his prime , Wagner consistently was charged with forty to sixty errors a year . It 's a rare shortstop who boots more than thirty plays a season nowadays . Modern models of excellence are Rizzuto and Reese , who made fourteen and eighteen errors , respectively , in lab-game seasons . Eddie Collins , prince of second basemen , made nineteen errors in 7K0 chances in 1916 , his best year . Jackie Robinson handled 832 chances with only seven misplays in 1961 . Errors have been cut in half in both leagues since 1900 . Sure , gloves arc better , and well-manicured diamonds have eliminated a lot of bad bounces , but those factors are.more than counterbalanced by the hopped-up speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fielding has improved enormously . Baseball myths are harder to squelch titan second guessers . So much nonsense has been written about the flaming aggressiveness of players years ago that fans probably believe the old-timers ate rookies for breakfast . The yarns are barefaced exaggerations , with one exception  --  Ty Cobb . He represents the only difference in the competitive spirit seen then and now . Cobb was unique . There never was anyone like him , and perhaps it 's just as well . Once I saw him try to go from first to third on a short single to center . Sam Rice 's throw had him dead to rights by ten feet , and Os-sic Bluege , then a rookie , went down the line to take the ball , Cobb leaped at Bluege with his spikes and slashed him down both thighs . It was the most sickening sight I ever saw . " That 'll teach you to go off the bag to tag me , " Cobb snarled . I know of at least one player whose career was ended by Cobb in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Senators , was spiked so badly by Cobb that he never came back . I had one brush with Cobb . He tore into second on a force play with his spikes waving in my face . " Get out of my way or I 'll cut you to ribbons , busher , " he barked . I was n't a big hero , but I knew I 'd be a clay pigeon for every bully in the league if Cobb got me on the hip . " Try it and I 'll throw the ball down your throat , " I said , Mr. Cobb gave me no trouble thereafter . Apart from Cobb , there are as many firebrands and tough guys and gamecocks around as there ever were . Jackie Robinson would 've made a lot of old-timers look like pantywaists , and young punks never came fresher than Billy Martin . On the whole , I believe the boys play harder today because there 's more incentive for winning . A raise 0 ( 11000 was the most a rookie or a veteran could hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of S3500 a year , but today a Willie Mays can jump from $1 2,000 to 533,000 in one season . Al Kaline , who is just twenty-one , is getting $25,000 . You . ca n't tell me that kind of money does n't stimulate hustling . Every manager will agree that the hallmark of a good competitor is his willingness to make sacrifices for the team 's welfare . On that count , modern players make the old-timers look like dumb , self-centered chowderheads . An established veteran always screamed bloody murder if he was asked to change to another position to make a place for a man who could strengthen the line-up . The situation rarely came up , be . cause managers , including myself , lacked the imagination to juggle personnel and get all their best men into the game . It has just dawned on me why Clark Griffith gave me the big break of my life by picking me out of a hat to manage thc Senators in 92+ . It must have gone back to the day when he called me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Grilfs strict orders , and I thought he was going to chew me out . I waited for the blowoff all through lunch at the Racquet Club , but Griff seemed to be on the defensive . " I 've got a favor to ask of you , " he blurted suddenly . " Would you mind going to third base if I get Eddie Collins to manage the team and play second ? " I casually said sure , I 'd do anything to help the dub . Griff 's deal for Collins fell through , and my co-operative attitude must have been what caused him to think of me for the manager 's job . I do n't know of any other qualification I had that could have impressed Gruff . During the war , managers had to make wholesale shifts in desperation . This put an end to the nonsense of static line-ups . Kids were smart enough to go along with the new trend . A rookie who finds his bid for a regular job blocked by a better man today will have a go at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to hang on by proving hisvalue in several spots . I could fill a page with successful switches in recent years , but I 've got the space to mention only a handful . The Dodgers have won pennants with Robinson playing four different positions , Billy Goodman has made himself indispensable to the Red Sox by filling in at five positions in emergencies . Gil Hodges , who started as a catcher , is the best first baseman in the business . Whitey Lockman helped the Giants win two pennants by shuttling between the outfield and first base . Casey Stengel has won six pennants in seven years by manipulating play . ers as though they were pieces in a jigsaw puzzle . About a dozen times a year I pay through the nose for engineering the Yankees ' most important switch back in 1947 , the conversion of Yogi Berra from an outfielder to a catcher . Here 's one old-timer who does n't believe baseball went into the quick freezer when the old superstars departed . I can whip up a team , limited to men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have given an all-star squad picked from baseball 's first century a helluva tussle . It would have Williams , Dialaggio and Musial in the outfield ; Mize , Gordon , Boudreau and Robinson in the infield ; Campanella and Berra catching , and Feller , Roberts and Spahn pitching . The line-up presents two problems . Who would lead off and who would hit in the eighth slot ? It would be a sin and a shame to waste any of my guys in those spots . I 'd gachivec , a year 's pay to wrestle with that head-
