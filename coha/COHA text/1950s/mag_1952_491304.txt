U N Memphis , Tennessee , one sunny morning last fall , an elderly colored man , obviously distraught , rushed into the street in front of his neat , white-shingled house to wave down the large black limousine of Mr. Wallace Johnson , a Memphis builder . " Mr. Wallace ? " the old man said portentously , his voice trembling , " Mr. Wallace , they is after me again . " Mr. Johnson pondered this statement , pulling thoughtfully at his nose . " How close are they to you , Henry ? " he asked . " Mr. Wallace , they is right at me , " the old man answered . He looked as if he were about to burst into tears . Mr. Johnson feigned sternness . " Now , Henry , you know a man has to pay his rent . Ca n't let him stay if he fails to pay up by the fifth of the month . " " I know that , Mr. Wallace , " the old man said imploringly . " But I been laid up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right now , though . I just needs a little time . " By now Mr. Johnson seemed on the verge of tears . " Henry , " he interrupted , " you go on up to my office . You tell them up there 1 said let you have what money you need . Then you go see my rent boys and get straightened out with them . You know I wo n't let nobody throw you out in the street . " The old man stepped back from the car . " God bless you , Mr. Wallace . " " God bless you , too , Henry , " Johnson said . He drove on . " A dear old soul , " said Johnson to his companion . " I 'm glad I run into him . He helped me make up my mind about something . Yesterday some folks offered me $160,000 for my equity in some colored rental property I built over on the other side of town . They wanted to buy me out , take over the mortgage and run it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that project just like that old fellow we just talked to . They 'll need nursing along a little from time to time . They 'd be too hard on ' em . I 'm going to turn their offer down . " He did . A tall , shambling man who describes himself as being " just a po ' little old peckerwood boy from Mississippi trying to do all the good he can in the world , " Johnson is a genuinely pious , profoundly sentimental man who believes that God has called him , as a minister is called , not to preach , but to use his exceptionally sharp business brain for building small , pleasant houses which poor folks can afford to buy or rent . In a profession in which most practitioners prefer to build high-cost and high-profit houses and apartments , Johnson is a mass producer of small units in which only the aggregate profit is large . He likes to hear himself referred to as the Henry Ford of the building trades , a title not undeserved when it is considered that Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for the past ten years , including many built elsewhere under Government contract . His attitude toward a well-built house is almost reverential . His desk is covered with sentimental poetic tributes to The Home . He believes you can take the sorriest sort of man out of a slum , put him in a house he can be proud of , and he will give up spending his money on liquor , women and games of chance and will spend it instead on rugs , drapes , refrigerators and TV sets . With a pleasant home , Johnson feels , a man will avoid beer joints and pool halls on Saturday night and will arise clear-eyed on Sunday morning in a mood to go to church . " Bomah ! " Mr. Johnson sometimes booms mysteriously at visitors to his office . He then goes on to explain that Bomah means " Builder of Men and Homes . " " That is what I have asked the Lord to let me be , " he says . " And that is what , with His help , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Mr. Johnson and his wife , Alma , whose religious feeling is as deep as his , but whose more conservative nature sometimes tempers his eleemosynary impulses , both look upon the Lord as the senior partner in their business . Johnson confirms this . The Lord , he feels , is not only his mentor but a never-failing patron , happy to bestow all manner of largess if Johnson only asks . Johnson does not hesitate to ask . In the drawer of his desk he keeps a number of ruled tablets on which are inscribed in pencil the more formal prayers he and his wife have prayed in the past dozen.years . Johnson writes down these prayers so that he will not overlook asking for anything he needs . In one tablet , dated January 1 , 1945 , Johnson began by praying that the people in his office should become more tilled with the Christian spirit , there being disturbing evidence that some of them were not attending church . " 0 Lord , " he asked then , " make us one of the greatest leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and help the city officials of Memphis to understand that this is our goal , so they will help us instead of hinder us . " Make me , 0 Lord , " he continued , " one of the leading Baptists of the United States , and teach me how to win souls . 0 Lord , help me to be one of the biggest businessmen in the United States , and if it be Thy will , let me be a vice-president of the association . " ( The National Association of Home Builders , of which Mr. Johnson is now a vice-president . ) " God , please , oh , please , let us build 20Q0 units in 1945 , and if it be in accordance with Thy divine purpose , let us accumulate $250,000 in cash during that time . " ( Johnson 's firm built nearly 3000 houses and apartments in 1945 and ended the year with nearly $450,000 in the bank. ) " 0 Lord , help us to build a good house cheaper than anyone else in the United States , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sawmills or whatever else we need . May we be able to house the Negro citizens of our community as they have never been housed before . And , God , please , oh , please help us to make connection with the right kind of banks , that understand that mortgages on Negro property are as safe an investment as any other kind , so that we can go on and on and on . " This 1945 prayer Johnson looks upon as the basic one in which he explains to the Lord his over-all ambitions . Since then , when his plans have hit a snag of one kind or another , he has asked for help in more specific detail . On one occasion he asked the Lord to intercede in his behalf in a spirited squabble with the city over what size drainage culvert he should install in a subdivision . He prayed that the National Production Authority would permit him to run a gas line to one of his projects , pleaded earnestly that a $200,000 loan would go through , and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too slowly to suit him should be promptly sold . On another occasion , when he was having a little loan trouble , he prayed , " 0 Lord , let us do the right thing , so that our firm will be listed in Dun and Bradstreet . " In the past dozen years , the Lord and the John-sons have done a great deal toward changing the face of Memphis . It would be an exaggeration to say that a new heaven and a new earth had been created in that proud old city sprawled on the bluffs above the Mississippi , but it does come nearer now than ever before to living up to its name , which means " Place of Good Abode . " The population of Memphis has increased by 121,000 since 1941 , but new housing has been constructed there for 139,000 people , and one out of every five families has moved into new quarters . Of the 30,000 rental units built since 1946 , about 5000 were in the low-rent ? below fifty dollars a month ? field . Though Johnson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial street , he was the pioneer who proved that the folks whose incomes were small , particularly the Negroes , wanted decent housing as-much as anybody else did , and that they would pay their rent or their mortgage payments steadily month after month if the payments could he kept low enough . This confidence that a prayerful man with a profound knowledge of all the moneysaving tricks of the building trade could make a prodigious financial success in a field ( Cont ed on Page 70 ) THAT PRAYIN ' MILLIONAIRE FROM MEMPHIS ( Continued from Page 37 ) most builders consider extremely hazardous has paid off handsomely for Johnson . In 1939 he was nearly forty years old and earning $37.50 a week as a somewhat harassed salesman for a building-supplies firm . Thirteen years later , he is well-to-do beyond his fondest dreams . In 1950 he collected nearly $1,000,000 from his rental property and built for himself a $65,000 mansion complete with an oxygen tent under which he sleeps at night when his asthma starts bothering him . He owns a sawmill in Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a retail lumber yard that does $300,000 worth of business a year ; a plumbing company that grosses $1,200,000 ; an electrical concern that does $300,000 ; a sand-gravel-and-brick yard that brings in roughly $1,500,000 ; and a retail hardware store , a linoleum-andtile company and a nursery , where he raises the trees and shrubs which he plants around the houses and subdivisions that he builds , which add another $500,000 to his gross take . Though the money rolls in at a rate that sometimes astonishes him , he gets to keep only a small percentage of it . The 800 people who now work for him draw down some $1,500,000 a year in wages and salaries , and he is generous with bonuses . He also owes a lot of money . " Sweetheart , " he told a visitor  --  one of his mild peculiarities being his habit of addressing even casual acquaintances , regardless of their sex , as " sweetheart , " " honey " or " darling " ? " I could n't tell you offhand how much I am worth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any one individual man in Memphis or Shelby County . But it do n't worry me a bit . When I lie down at night and turn the light off , I 'm asleep by the time the room gets dark . I know I wo n't let the Lord down , and I know He wo n't let me down . What I 've done so far is just the beginning . I 've put ? a lot of people in good homes , homes that are going to inspire them to be better Christians . But I 've just got started . There are still 4500 acres of slums in this city that ought to be replaced with decent housing . And if all the people who 've been backing me keep their faith in me  --  I 'm just going to keep going on and on . " Johnson , who has tithed ever since he was a dollar-an-hour carpenter in Mississippi , still gives 10 per cent of his income to what he terms the Lord 's work . Sometimes his gifts take the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Avenue Baptist Church for its new $420,000 educational building , or when he builds a pastor 's house for a small Mississippi church . Most of his companies , though , pay their tithe into the Wallace E. Johnson Foundation , an institution modeled after the Ford Foundation . The foundation at present is paying for the theological education of a number of young Baptist preachers , and a Negro girl singer from Indianola , Mississippi , whose voice , Johnson says , just pours out like water out of a jug . Johnson is also planning an old-folks ' home , to be built by the foundation fonds . It will consist of tiny cottages for old couples and separate dormitories for those who have no mates . There will be grass and trees and garden plots , where they can raise vegetables and flowers . " Most places like that , " Johnson says , " the old folks ca n't do anything but sit and look at each other , or pat up and down the concrete , hunting somebody to talk to . " Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his zest for personal evangelism . He casts a sharp eye about him when he attends the Union Avenue Baptist Church on Sunday mornings , and if he notes the absence of any of his employees who are supposed to be there , he calls them up to ask pointedly if they are sick . When interviewing candidates for a job , he inquires whether or not they drink , and how often they attend church . Johnson takes a keen personal interest in the moral development of all who work for him , and he sometimes goes through the canceled payroll checks to see which of them were cashed at liquor stores . When he finds one , he calls the offender in and gives him a lecture . For a while there was a belief in Memphis that nobody who took a drink or who failed to go to church would be allowed to work for the Johnsons . This , Johnson said , is a canard . One of Mr. Johnson 's great triumphs in his effort to gentle and make mild the ofttimes rough and violent men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gigantic , redheaded Irishman named Basil Willy Stevenson , known as Big Steve . Big Steve , a construction foreman , was famed for irascibility and for the harshness of his language , particularly on the morning after those nights when he had stayed out late , reveling . When Big Steve came to work for Mr. Johnson , the betting was five to one that he could not be persuaded to change his ways . After a few months of Johnson 's insistent evangelizing , a change came over the mountainous Irishman . He still insisted on top-grade work , but he no longer threatened mayhem on those who displeased him . He now goes to bed by seven o'clock in the evening and is a pillar in the Poplar Avenue Baptist Church , in which he was recently baptized , a feat accomplished with some difficulty due to the fact he weighs 285 pounds . " I 'm not as good as I ought to be yet , " Big Steve admits . " But I am a hell of a sight better than I was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prodigious building career , he knew every man who worked for him , the names of his wife and children and what church he attended . As his business expanded , he lost this personal touch to a great extent . To find out what was going on on his jobs , therefore , he has on occasion let his hair grow long , cultivated a three-day growth of beard , dressed himself in overalls and , letting chocolate dribble down his chin to simulate tobacco juice , has gone down on Adams Avenue , where carpenters and construction workers hang out . Safe behind this disguise , he would casually inquire what kind of jobs this fellow Johnson ran . By such espionage he learned that on some of his jobs the foremen were handling the men roughly , abusing them harshly on occasion ; He put a stop to it . " If a laborer is not worthy of his hire , " he told his foremen , " fire him . But do n't cuss him . It 's un-Christian . " Johnson , who works nonunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , providing them with health insurance and maintaining a fund from which they can borrow money  --  at very low interest rates  --  in case of genuine emergencies . If a young workman impresses him favorably , he is likely to jump him suddenly into a position of great responsibility . One of his $10,000-a-year superintendents was making $17.50 a week as a laborer only a few years ago . " I guess I 've ruined about as many men as I 've made , though , " he says ruefully . " Some fellows I 've jumped from seventy-five dollars a week to one hundred fifty just could n't stand prosperity . Saturday night just was n't long enough for them . " Johnson himself has never wasted much time on frivolity . Born in the piney woods of Mississippi , where his father was at various times a fiftycents-a-day sawmill laborer , a tenant farmer and a blacksmith , Johnson early began to show signs of industriousness , piety and thrift abnormal in a small boy . At the age of seven , he picked a bale of cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church without being urged by anyone . " No praying over me , no pleading , no pressure of any kind , " he recalls . " Just little ol ' Wallace Johnson walkin ' clown the aisle all by himself to give his heart to Jesus . " At sixteen , Johnson was a knockabout carpenter , and by the time he was eighteen he had saved up $1800 in cash . The time had come , he felt , to enter business for himself , so he contracted to build a $9000 house for a well-to-do railroad agent . By the time he had finished putting together the jigsaw-puzzle parts of an imported French mantelpiece , the house had cost $11,000 . His $1800 was gone and he was $400 in debt . Urged by his mother , who traces her ancestry back to Jonathan Edwards , the famous New England preacher , Johnson went , somewhat chastened , back to high school , working in the afternoons to pay off the $400 he owed while his mother made and sold rag dolls for fifty cents each to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after nearly three years , one of his former creditors , much impressed by his efforts to pay his debts , hired him to manage a retail lumberyard ? salary , $100 a month . He immediately began to woo a Miss Alma McCool , daughter-of an itinerant sawmill mechanic . Johnson had met Miss McCool before , when he was a carpenter . " She was pretty as a speckled pup on a banana wagon , " he said , " and when I first laid eyes on her I knew that she could make tracks around my flour barrel any time she wanted to . " Miss McCool had no desire to make tracks around Mr. Johnson 's flour barrel , being in love with someone else at the time . But Johnson pressed his suit with such ardor that she finally succumbed , to the amazement of her brothers , who somewhat disrespectfully referred to Johnson as " that big-footed , long-legged peckerwood . " The Johnson-McCool alliance has proved extraordinarily happy . Mrs. Johnson is a full partner in all of Johnson 's enterprises , a clear-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . In the building trades there appears to be a tendency on the part of the more successful men to replace with new and flashier models the wives they wed when they were straw bosses . Johnson likes to tease Alma about reversing this precedure and swapping him off . " No , " she says calmly . " It took me too long to break you in and train you . " As a married man , Johnson set out with great zeal to better himself , taking a correspondence course in architecture and learning how to make blueprints . Before he could venture into contracting again , though , the depression hit , the lumberyard shut down 72 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 26 , 1952 and he and Alma drifted to Arkansas , where he worked as shipping clerk at a sawmill . He was fairly content there until the sawmill boss , suspecting that Johnson was after his job  --  a suspicion probably not without foundation  --  fired him . " Thank God he did , " Johnson says . " Thank God he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lumberjack somewhere over there in the Arkansas swamps today . " Johnson went to Memphis , where , for the next ten years , he worked as salesman for a builders ' - supply house . He learned that a good many people would like to have a house of their own and could pay off a mortgage by the month , but few of them had the down payment  --  banks at that time being afraid to lend more than 60 per cent on the value of a house . Then , with FHA guaranteeing up to 85 per cent of building costs , Johnson saw his chance . He quit his job , borrowed $250 on his automobile and set out to build a house to sell for $3000 . All his years of fooling around with plans paid off at once . He put the house up , a solid , well-arranged , comfortable little five-roomer , sold it for $2999 and pocketed a $300 net profit for himself . That year he built eighty more , the next year 360 . " I figured out twenty-seven different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Now I can build a thousand houses in the same subdivision , using just two basic plans . By changing them a little on the outside , they 'll all look different . If anybody had told me ten years ago I could do that , I 'd have kissed a pig . " When the war came , with restrictions on building , Johnson thought he was sunk . But war housing was needed in Mississippi and Arkansas , and before long Johnson 's swiftly expanding organization was turning out a finished house every two and one half hours . As Johnson got his hands on large chunks of cash , he began to set up his own suppliers , eliminating the middleman . His greatest problem was lumber , and here he thinks the Lord saved him . Once , when he was down to two weeks ' supply of lumber , and neither love nor priorities could get him any more without his going into the black market  --  a solution that his Baptist conscience would not condone  --  he got lost while driving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he found himself , he passed a sawmill , its yard piled high with 1,000,000 feet of air-cured pine . Down the road a piece he picked up two hitchhikers , who told him that the millowner had just died and that the mill was temporarily shut down . Johnson turned around , called on the widow and gave her $10,000 cash and a $30,000 note for the mill and all its lumber . Later on , he found another , bigger mill , which he bought for $160,000 . When ihe war ended , Johnson went back to building his old $2999 house , only now it had to sell for around $7000 . He was doing well , but his conscience hurt him . Driving around , looking at lots on which to put his houses , he passed the slums of the Negro sections , screenless , porchless , paintless shanties , huddled in the marshy flats , leaning drunkenly together on the banks of drainage ditches . Johnson knew that the Negroes who lived in these coops wanted better housing . He knew that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford better houses . All over Memphis hammers and saws were ringing , and homes were going up . But few of them were homes that a low-income man could afford . Another man who was displeased by this was Joe Fowler , director of the Memphis Housing Authority . Fowler knew that in his colored housing projects were hundreds of Negro families whose incomes had risen so that they were no longer eligible for public housing . But he could n't turn them out , for there was no place for them to go . The theory of public housing was that the public project should be the steppingstone from the slum to private housing . But private builders had n't built the houses and apartments to complete the cycle . Another Memphian disturbed by the same facts was Buck Horner , then director of the FHA for Tennessee . He went to a meeting of the Citizens Housing Committee and lectured the architects , the builders , the building-andloan people and the real-estate men gathered there pretty harshly about Memphis ' failure to build any decent housing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't do much good . Then he went to Johnson . " Wallace , " he said , " you built a good house once for $3000 . You see what you can do about building some houses and apartments for Negroes . Figure out something that can rent around $31.50 for one bedroom , $37.50 for two . " " By heck , " said Johnson , using his strongest expletive , " I 'll try it . " He sharpened his pencil , prayed awhile and drew up some plans , and prayed and figured some more . He could n't see how he could come out on a unit to rent for $31.50 and $37.50 . But he could build a pretty good apartment for $33.50 and $41.00 . With FHA guaranteeing the mortgage , it was n't too hard to manage the financial end , though banks and mortgage brokers at first were wary of lending money on Negro property . In the past , folks had thrown together $600 houses for Negroes , gave them no maintenance and charged fifteen to twenty dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every two or three years . That was a sound investment . These long-term loans were something else again . Negroes were supposed to be hard to find on rent day . Johnson did n't think so . A lot of spadework had to be done . He had to persuade the city tax assessors to keep taxes low so that rents could be kept low . He had to persuade white residents of a neighborhood that a pleasant , well-built Negro project near them would n't decrease their property value . He had to get the cooperation of the utilities in laying gas and water lines , electric lines , and setting up transportation systems to his projects . He had to persuade the school people to plan for new schools , and the parks department to lay out new parks near his proposed projects . He had to persuade the Negroes themselves that it was just as easy to come to the rental office every month with a full month 's rent as it was to pay a collector once a week , as they had always done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well on the outskirts of town  --  everybody thought it was fine . Except the Negroes . A Negro businessman to whom he showed the plans took one look and shook his head . " Too isolated , " he said . " Negroes like to live close to other Negroes . They like to live near their churches and lodges and to the stores where they have been trading . " So Johnson abandoned the outlying . site , and almost in the heart of town bought up some vacant lots that lay close beside an extremely shabby Negro slum . Here he built Vandalia , first big low-rent project to be built with private capital on an FHA-guaranteed mortgage in Memphis . It was made up of well-built one- and two-bedroom apartments , equipped with mechanical refrigerators , gas stoves , automatic hot-water heaters , hot-air gas heat , built-in kitchen cabinets and Venetian blinds . Before the project was well under way , 1400 tenants were clamoring for the 170 apartments . Johnson , in order to get any sleep at night , had to switch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein , he ( Cone I on Page 76 ) EVENING POST ( Continued from Page 72 ) immediately started Lincoln Apartments , on the other side of town-158 more units modeled on Vandalia . Next to Vandalia , he started two more projects , Yale and Tunica . White house hunters , prowling through the new apartments , set , up a clamor , urging that they be set aside for white occupancy . Johnson refused , but bought up land and built 300 white units , at rents ranging from $38.50 to $62.50 . At the same time , he was building more than 1000 small houses for sale to both whites and Negroes . By the time Vandalia was filled and Johnson had started on Lincoln , other Memphis builders , who had shied away from low-cost housing , began to sniff the sweet scent of profits in the air . Setting up ofttimes on land adjoining Johnson 's projects , they , too , began to build the same type low-rent units . Fourteen hundred Negro families , whose incomes of more than $3000 a year made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last were able to move out into new houses or apartments . Half of them bought their own homes . An equal number of families whose income was less than $2400 a year moved up from the It s to take their places in the Fed-projects . All during this period , Johnson had had his eye on the squalid cluster of shacks hard by his Vandalia project . Vacant land was getting scarce . Rather than spread all over Shelby County , he felt it made more sense to replace with decent housing the ancient rookeries in the heart of town . On the five-acre patch opposite Vandalia , fifty families lived , more like pigs than people , in twenty crumbling , jerry-built houses . He began buying up this land . Finally he had it all but one lot . " Miss Ada " owned this lot , which sat right in the middle of one side of the tract , and Miss Ada would n't sell . An elderly colored woman of determined disposition , she had bought her shack with her own hard-earned money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nawsir , " she told Johnson 's emissaries , " I wo n't sell . I like my little house . I likes to sit here on my porch in the evening and rock and watch the people pass . " Johnson 's whole massive building organization was stymied by Miss Ada . Finally Johnson called on Ham Smythe , his trouble shooter . " Darling , " he told Smythe , " you go see that dear old soul and tell her we 'll do whatever she wants . But do n't come back without a deed to that lot . " Smythe left . He told Miss Ada they would buy her another , larger lot up the street a few blocks . They would put her little house on rollers and move it up there , and if it was damaged any in the moving , they would repair the damage . On top of this , they would give Miss Ada $2000 in cash . Miss Ada pondered briefly . " Mr. Ham , " she said , " I think that is right nice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up the street to its new site , Johnson 's bulldozers were crumpling into wreckage the hideous shanties of the old slum . The two-story , gray-shingled apartments which Johnson built on the old slum site attracted attention all over the country . It dramatized all the other low-cost housing that had been carried out in Memphis by private builders , and Johnson now receives inquiries from all over the country , asking for blueprints of his projects and inquiring what is his secret formula for building low-cost housing in a high-cost time . January 26 , 1932 He sends the blueprints gladly and denies that be has discovered any magic formula . The methods by which he saves money without sacrificing too much quality are known to every good builder , he says . His houses and apartments are planned in such a way that standard eight- , ten- and twelve-foot lengths of lumber can be used without much sawing . He prefabricates and preassembles as much as he can , sending corner studs , window openings and rough door framing to the job , ready to be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slab , laid on eighteen-inch concrete footings , the floor insulated from the earth with wire mat and felt , and covered with asphalt tile . He stains and waxes interior woodwork , which is cheaper than painting it , leaves off closet doors , substituting far less expensive rods for curtains , and puts no doorbells on his one-story buildings . But he takes no short cuts that affect sturdiness . Alma , his partner who supervises the decoration and finish of all his projects , insists that he build in plenty of closet space , that rooms shall be light , well ventilated , and painted in pleasant colors , warm tints for rooms with a northern exposure , cool blues and greens on the south . She also checks each unit when finished to see that the screens fit snugly , nailheads are sunken and puttied over , and that each speck of paint has been cleaned from window panes , hardware and floors . One secret of his ability to build small houses cheaply is the speed with which his veteran carpenters , painters , plumbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long that they can almost do it with their eyes shut . Another big factor in fast , economical building is a chart by which Johnson can tell at a glance how a job is progressing from day to day . By studying this code , he keeps materials flowing to a job , arriving as needed . He tries to rush a few roofs on , so that his men can work inside on rainy days without a layoff . Johnson makes a special effort to get a high-class tenant , a hard-working man who sleeps at night instead of helling around squandering the rent money . He checks through jail records , their job records and their credit rating , and tries to get only those people whose weekly wage is equal to a month 's rent , or better . He has found that his colored tenants take as much pride in their homes as do his white renters , and that only two of them out of hundreds have had to forfeit the twenty-five-dollar fund they put up as security against unreasonable damage . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may fall a month behind , only 2 per cent have been evicted for not paying . Johnson is fond of dropping in on his renters and is proud of the fact that , of the 328 tenants in Vandalia and Lincoln apartments , 324 of them have radios , 192 own automobiles , sixty own television sets and 211 have telephones . None have been in any serious trouble with the law since they 've lived there . He believes all these things indicate the stabilizing influence of good housing . " If I just accomplish two things , " said Johnson , " I will be well satisfied . If I can just convince all my brother builders all over the country that they can not only make money for themselves but can help their community by building low-rent homes , and if I can just persuade those Yankee bankers that a mortgage on Negro property is a good mortgage , then I have done a whole lot for humanity .
