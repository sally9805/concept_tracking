Calls for Honesty " It is too early to define all the Issues of the 1952 campaign , " Taft said . " Broadly spea'cing , the issue , as I see it , is the restoration of honest principles to government . " The Republican party offers a ? mum to honesty and frankness in the day to day conduct of the vast , sprawling federal government . It offers a return to the principles of liberty which are threatened by a crtepinv socialism masquerading as welfare and Planning and social insurance .

Only a Republican administration can restore principles of common . honesty to Washington .

Turning to foreign policy , Taft said : " The history of the Korean war shows that the administration has no foreign policy , has no consistency and no principle  --  this Korean war is a Truman war . Today the American people resent the Korean war because it was an unnecessary war . " I believe that we should have adopted the proposals of Gen. at the time they were made because Gen. did not like to fight a war in which he was prevented from ever winning a victory ; the President dismissed the man who - knew most about the far east and whose magnificent success in Japan has converted the Japanese to a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice and the outrageous methods which led to that arbitrary dismissal .
