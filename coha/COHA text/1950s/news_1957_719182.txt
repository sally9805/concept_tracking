txt Letter to the Editor 1 ? No Title WILLIAM PROXMIRE , A. BLODNIEKS , ABBOTT WASHBURN , BUELL G. GALLAGHER , HENRY MILLER , To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If what you said in your Sept. 17 editorial were true  --  that " close to 100 per cent of the nonpolitically minded economists specializing in this field " support what Ezra Taft Benson stands for  --  then we should indeed take great alarm for the condition of the nation 's academic resources . Mr. Benson accepted the office of Secretary of Agriculture less than three months after the winning Republican candidate for President had promised specifically and explicitly to " stand behind " the price support law then on the books . Mr. Benson immediately turned his back on these promises , one and all of them . Ever since he has been publicly repudiating them either by word or deed or both . He advocated a sliding scale of price supports which he maintained would reduce surpluses and cut Government costs . After five years in office Mr. Benson has spent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much as the Democrats lost in all the twenty preceding years . The cost in the fisci I year just ended was the highest in history . And the " surpluses " under loan or owned by the Government today amount to five times as much as five years ago . Now , after this fiasco , Mr. Benson confesses that his sliding scale program is a failure and is asking Congress to give him the authority to do away with price supports altogether . Effect on Prices and Income You are wrong when you say , as you do in your editorial , that " Mr. Benson is to be applauded for keeping his campaign on this level " when he claims that " the things we are proposing are right and good for agriculture . " Do you have any notion of what Mr. Benson 's present proposals would do to the level of farm prices and farm family income ? Farm prices are now 14 per cent below those of 1952 . Farmers ' net incomes have dropped about one-fourth since that year . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Benson 's critics , " who send telegrams to the President * * * would benefit a comparatively small minority of the nation 's farmers , most of whom are already in the higher farm-income brackets . " I do not know of any of Mr. Benson 's critics who favor the higher-income minority of farmers . In fact , it is precisely this minority among the farmers from whom comes the small degree of farmer support that Mr. Benson does receive . It is interesting to speculate whether their favor is aroused by the fact that the Benson program is liquidating the smaller , less economically durable farming operations , thus enabling the remaining big farmers to take over the land of those who are driven out of business . Aid for Family Farm As for me , the policies I advocate are aimed very specifically and deliberately to favor the efficientsized family farm . I advocate helping the family-sized farmer in areas where he is weak and defenseless against the powerful interests with whom he contends in the market places where he buys his supplies , borrows his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " subsidize inefficiency , " as is often so thoughtlessly charged , but rather to protect and promote the most efficient agricultural producers the world has ever seen -- our family-scale farmers  --  against competitive disadvantages which have nothing whatsoever to do with production efficiency . To do this requires active and forceful intervention by the Federal Government on a scale comparable to its intervention to enforce antitrust laws , minimum wage and hour standards , regulation of public utilities , and so forth . WILLIAM PROXMIRE , United States Senate . Washington , Oct. 9 , 1957 . Deportations From Latvia To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Committee for a Free Latvia noted with satisfaction that in your recent article " Old Traits Found in Riga and Lvov " the correspondent of The New York Times depicted conditions new prevailing in occupied Latvia 's capital city , Riga . However , the committee considers it a duty to elucidate some facts mentioned in the . article with regard to the deportations carried out by the Soviets . The first deportation of Latvians carried out in 1941 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by several deportations after the end of the 1. var . There were three mass deportations of Latvians , each of them dispatching several tens of thousands of people , Besides the two mass deportations mentioned by your correspondent there was the third one when approximately 50,000 farmers and their family members were deported in 1949 , as the result of the establishment of kolkhozes in Latvia . The qualification of the deportees as " anti-social elements , " as it appears in the article with reference to the first deportation in 1941 , is liable to create a misunderstanding and has provoked a certain bitterness among Latvians in the free world . It is obvious that with regard to the thousands of deported children and babies it could be said that they did not have such qualification . Also , grown people who belonged to various social classes ( workers , in ? tellectuals , etc. ) were loyal citizens of Latvia . It should be added that the deportations carried out by the Soviet occupation regime , including yearly deportations of youths to the Asian parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one common aim . This aim is to weaken the vital sources of the Latvian nation and to facilitate the Russification of the country . Because of the patriotic attitude of the Latvian nation the Soviet occupation regime has not yet succeeded in carrying out Russifica ? tion , which fact is clearly percep ? tible from Mr. Frankel 's article .

Radio Moscow Quizzes Use of Technique for Political and Propaganda Purposes Cited To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Radio Moscow 's quiz for its British listeners reported in your Sept. 30 issue is not a new Communist propaganda device . A series of similar quizzes , all of which contained political and propaganda undertones , have been held in the past . A quiz held a few months ago for North American listeners is an example . It was composed of nine questions . Several alluded to themes of peaceful coexistence and friendship between the peoples of America and Russia : " On what day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of World War II ? " " Name the Soviet airman who made the first non-stop flight over the North Pole to the United States , " etc . Radio Moscow soon thereafter announced that a large number of its American listeners participated in the quiz and some of them won prizes . The prizes consisted of a book of photographs of Moscow , an album of Soviet stamps and recordings of music from various Soviet folksongs . The songs bear such titles as " Thanks to the Party , " " Agriculturists , Engineers Are Coming to Our Kolkhoz , " " Guard Your Homeland , " " Home of Democratic ) Youth , " etc . A similar radio quiz contest was organized by Moscow RadioLfor its Arab listeners earlier this year . Among the questions was this : " Who is the Soviet delegate who insisted in the Security Council on the immediate evacuation of British and French forces from Syria and Lebanon ? " Moscow Radio , which broadcasts 868 hours per week in foreign languages , seems to be using the quiz technique to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider and more consistent audience . The other , as in the case of the Arabs , to equate Soviet political goals with the immediate interests of the area to which the broadcasts are directed . , o.A.BBOTT WASHBURN , Deputy Director , United States Information Agency . Washington , Oct : . 2 , 1957 , Racial Imbalance in Housing To TH , EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Taunt Philip J. Cruise , in his letter published Oct. 9 , makes reference to The Times ' account of my remarks on racial integration in housing made before a City College student group . Actually , my talk concerned itself primarily with the integration problem in private housing and referred only incidentally to public housing , since I firmly believe the record of the New York City Housing Authority is miles ahead of the private developers . The real question , I think , is whether we are to remain content with progress already achieved or whether we are to undertake a continuing and imaginative campaign to secure fully integrated housing , . I know of Mr. Cruise 's deep personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority , with the problem of promoting a healthier racial balance in our city projects . I agree with him that the matter is a " painfully complex " one . And perhaps out of this recognition will come the stimulus for . seeking out real and creative solutions to a very real problem . Mr. Cruise and I are equally , troubled by the present racial imbalance in some of our public proj ? ects , and apparently we are not nearly , as far apart in our views as the press account of my talk and his commentary thereon would seem to indicate .

Faubus Deemed Bad Example To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A deplorable aspect of the Little Rock situation is the evil example Governor Faubus has held up before young people . The burning of a Negro in effigy and sadism toward schoolmates by high School youngsters is a new note in American education . The art of obfuscation and opportunism has been practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , but the Governor has the dubious honor of bringing it into the classroom . In the annals of education Governor Faubus will long remain as the worst educational example of this or any other year .
