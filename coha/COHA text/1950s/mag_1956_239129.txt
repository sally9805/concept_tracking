Where , came a voice out of a crowd in New Jersey , had the Democratic candidate for the presidency picked up his suntan ? " Not from playing golf , " grinned Adlai Stevenson , " but from preaching the Democratic gospel in public places . " Other voices sounded out of other crowds : " We like Ike ! " Stevenson replied : " I 'd trust him with anything but public office . " In Morristown , N.J. he spotted a picture of Eisenhower behind a window grille across the square . " Surely , " he cracked , " there must be a more appropriate place for the President than behind bars . " <P> Thus last week Adlai Stevenson brought his campaign back to the populous , prosperous , vote-heavy states of the industrial Northeast . Everywhere he hitched on gently to the coattails of local Democratic candidates who were manifestly more popular than he ; everywhere he besought the voters to choose come November not between men but between parties ; everywhere he fingered meticulously for the soft spots of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tide . " The Republican managers , " he said to large and enthusiastic crowds in Springfield , Mass. , " see America as a big , well-oiled company controlled by men who , because they run the big corporations , think they ought to run the country . " Again and again he cried : " It is time to take the government away from General Motors and give it back to Joe Smith . " But somewhere beneath his genteel belligerency there still lurked the elements of the enigma of 1952 . " The tide is rising , " said he in Newark , after a day of small and disappointing crowds in Democratic sections of New Jersey . " I only hope I do n't get in the way . " <P> Moving westward through Pennsylvania in The Federal , the private railroad car in which Woodrow Wilson rode to victory in 1912 , he proclaimed out of the past that the Democrats had beaten the Republicans to social security , the minimum wage , federal aid to the farmer . Meanwhile , his managers had arranged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower 's speeches in Cleveland and Lexington . At Pittsburgh Stevenson stepped before the TV cameras for a speech billed as a " turning point " of the campaign , but his sharp thrusts at Eisenhower and the Republican social-welfare record were dulled by his halting delivery . And after it was all over , some Stevenson advisors had misgivings about the tactic of attacking the President anyway . <P> Last-Minute Qualm . Misgivings or no , the attack was on . One day last week Stevenson charged that the President , amid the economic distress , was claiming credit " for every good thing in the country from the American flag to fried chicken " - including the New Deal and Fair Deal ; this reminded Stevenson of how the Russians had claimed credit for inventing the telephone and TV . Eisenhower 's cabinet were " men of wealth and position , " and the President himself , Stevenson added in the distributed text , " has not known or cared what was going on . " At this point in the tactic , however , Stevenson , who fusses endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he toned down the last line of the attack to read " has not been fully informed . "
