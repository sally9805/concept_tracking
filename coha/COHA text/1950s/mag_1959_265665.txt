( See Cover ) <P> Every few years , in early summer , the U.S. is treated to an old , familiar spectacle . With flourish and fanfare , the representatives of the U.S. steel industry 's management and labor sit down to negotiate a new wage agreement , working against the steadily approaching threat of a strike deadline . Labor cockily demands a fat wage hike-and management just as cockily turns it down . Eight times since World War II they have fought their suspenseful duel ; five times it resulted in strikes , three times in an early agreement . This week the U.S. was up against the old deadline once more . But this time there was a vital difference . <P> Before and during the ten long weeks of marathon bargaining , President Eisenhower had warned both management and labor not to make an inflationary settlement , i.e. , one in which wage increases would be so big that they would force price increases . To prove how serious he felt about the dangers of inflation , Ike last week vetoed a housing bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warnings from every quarter-had awakened the nation to the perils of new inflation . As it met with labor last week in Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hotel , steel management was keenly aware of that peril-and of a second danger that followed directly from it : a growing threat to American steel in world markets from foreign competitors . <P> Whether the negotiators reached a last-minute settlement or allowed a strike to tie up 90% of U.S. steel production , those facts had already brought about a dramatic and significant change in the climate of U.S. labor relations . For the first time in 23 years , the nation 's third most powerful union ( after the teamsters and the autoworkers ) had run-to its shocked surprise - into a stone wall . After years of giving in to union demands for wage raises , the steel industry this year met labor with a hard new line , refused right up to this week to give the union a penny that would raise overall wage costs . <P> Change of Climate . Management 's firm policy was publicly expressed by R. Conrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the industry 's chief negotiator . But the man who devised it - and directed industry 's strategy from the background - is Roger Miles Blough , 55 , chairman of U.S. Steel Corp . Big Steel 's Roger Blough ( rhymes with now ) is perhaps the foremost advocate of a new look in U.S. labor-management relations . He feels that the U.S. is no longer a " laboristic society , " that U.S. business , after sweltering for years in a climate that considered labor invincible , can and must check the unions ' power , simply because it can no longer accept the high costs of labor demands . Looking over the whole economy , Blough knows that when it comes to inflation , foreign competition and other new factors in the economy , labor and management are in the same boat ; what hurts one also hurts the other .
