In the Bevanites ' theology , British socialism is a heady brew of rigid dogma , class hatred and " one in the eye for the boss . " For the practiced old trade union chiefs of Transport House , who put up some 60% of Labor Party funds and speak for 85% of its membership , socialism is an alteration , not an abolition , of capitalism , an evolution steeped in the Fabian " inevitability of gradualness . " From two general-election failures , trade unionists sense that Labor 's medicine , heavily laced with Bevanism , is too strong for most Britons . <P> Since they ousted ex-Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison from the Party Executive last year , the Bevanites have influenced policy out of all proportion to their real power . Last month the party 's " Challenge to Britain " platform called for partial nationalization of the complex aircraft , machine-tool and chemical industries . But last week the Trades Union Congress ( 183 unions , 8,000,000 members ) staged a counterattack . Keynoted Chairman Tom O'Brien : " The British trades union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks it is going to devour the father , it must be told there is nothing doing . " <P> The biennial conference of the Transport and General Workers ' Union-Britain 's biggest-met at Southsea , hard by Portsmouth docks . Bevanites hoped to make trouble . When bluff , able Arthur Deakin , 62 , the union 's general secretary , marched into the hall , packed with 800 representatives of the union 's truck drivers and milkmen , trawlermen and stable lads , home helps and gravediggers , someone reminded him that Nelson 's flagship Victory , with its hangman 's yardarm , was not far away . Deakin smiled grimly . " We do n't need the yardarm , " said he . <P> A Shout of Applause . " The test of nationalization , " Deakin told his delegates , " must be , ' How will it serve the interests of the people ? ' Nobody can say that . . . it has achieved satisfactory success . There is no wholesale and general approbation . . . There is a feeling that . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been improved at the expense of the consumer . " <P> Should there be more nationalization , as the Bevanites propose ? Boomed Deakin : " Where do you begin ? Where do you end ? We will have no precipitate action that would involve us . . . in chaos and confusion . . . " Next day he fought off a resolution that censured his anti-Bevanite stand . " I am perfectly sure I have 95% of the membership behind me , " he said . The answer : a great shout of applause . <P> Reassured by Deakin 's triumph , union leaders went right on planning a greater blow at Bevan : a policy statement that would cut right across the " Challenge to Britain , " and the re-election of Herbert Morrison to the Executive , in place of ailing , respected Arthur Greenwood , 73 . Said one union man : " The days of the hotheads are over . . . "
