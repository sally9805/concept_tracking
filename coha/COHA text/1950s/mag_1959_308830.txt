The new planet was tiny , as planets go , but it was the first ever put into the solar system by man . The Soviet Union 's moon-probe missile-promptly dubbed " Lunik " by the Russians-was a giant achievement in the young history of space exploration , the first time man had ever broken anything free from the tight gravitational hold of earth . <P> Lunik 's great , multistage launching rocket , which probably weighed 250 tons or more , roared up from some part of the Soviet Union on Friday . When the Russians made their first announcement , they could already say with confidence that the final stage had attained escape velocity . On Saturday they could announce that at 9:59 p.m . E.S.T. Lunik had passed the moon and plunged on into outer space on an orbit around the sun . At week 's end it was 318,000 miles from the earth and still going strong . <P> In contrast to U.S. Pioneers I and III , whose payloads were a modest 40 and 13 lbs . respectively , Lunik 's sheer size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total weight of its final stage without fuel was 3,245 lbs . <P> Ever since the Russians launched their Sputnik III on May 15 , 1958 , rocket experts have known that they had the potential ability to toss a good-sized bird out of the earth 's gravitational field . To put a satellite on a nearby orbit around the earth takes only about 25% less speed than the escape velocity ( 25,000 m.p.h. ) that will free it from the earth . All the Russians needed to do was to increase slightly the power of Sputnik Ill 's launching rockets or to reduce its final weight . U.S. failure to reach the moon was mainly due to the insufficient power of the launching vehicles . For the U.S. shots to succeed on their lesser thrust , every bit of sophisticated and delicate apparatus had to work perfectly , and this did not happen . <P> Degrees of Success . Since the Russians do not call their shots before they fire , Lunik may have been designed for several degrees of success . The most difficult would be to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force hoped to do with Pioneer I. But this stunt requires a small rocket to nudge the final stage into capture by the moon 's gravitational field , and the Russians have not mentioned any such item . Next degree of success would be to pass around the moon and return to earth . If the Russians were trying to do this , they did not know their own strength . When Lunik passed the moon , it was going so fast ( 5,500 m.p.h. ) that the moon 's feeble gravitation could not pull it back . <P> The overall aim was good . U.S. 's Pioneer III deviated from its planned course by 3.5 . If it had reached the moon 's orbit , it would have missed the moon by about 14,590 miles . The Russian miss ( 4,660 miles ) was an error of only slightly more than 1 .
