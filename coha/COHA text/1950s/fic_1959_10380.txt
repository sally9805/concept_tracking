SWALLOW was taking a bath , and as was his custom on such occasions , he had undressed before climbing into the tub . Man is a creature of habit , but there was more to it than that . Since most of the clothes he 'd been wearing were of the newfangled wash ' n wear , or drip-dry , variety , and equally in need of laundering , he might perfectly well have left them on and killed two birds with one stone . But Charles liked doing things the old way , even when they took more time and though the march of events had rendered them obsolete . It gave you a sense of tradition , and that , Charles increasingly felt as the years mellowed him into middle age , was something we all sorely needed . He had lately been rereading the works of John P. Maryland , with enormous pleasure . In fact he had begun to fancy himself rather a Marquandian sort of hero . For one thing , he had this profound sense of the past . It more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he was alive at all . He could remember the time when as a boy of six he had swallowed a pin , a small pearl-seeded brooch which he had taken from his mother 's dresser drawer on a rainy Sunday afternoon , and been rushed to the hospital for a bronchoscopy . Theyp4had engaged the most brilliant surgeon in the East to perform it . No expense had been spared for the recovery of the brooch , which had been in the family for generations and was regarded as priceless both as an heirloom and on its own account . Charles smiled as he recalled the incident , still vivid in his memorythough blurred in outline . Suddenly the smile left his face as he heard his wife call something through the closed door . It sounded like " Have you finished The Late George Apley ? " Now why in the world would she ask that just then ? It was an absurd query to put in the flutter of dressing for dinner , especially dinner with the Groteguts . Yet it had caught him preciselyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony ) that are the hallmark of the Marquandiangenre . So it must be more than coincidence  --  it must be mental telepathy . In some way , it seemed to substantiate his claim to status as a Marquand hero , for whom things were alwayscoming out of the blue to start the narrative ball rolling and make the protagonist wonder what the meaning of his life was . They were like nudges of a kaleidoscope which jiggle it into slight changes of pattern for the hero to squint a mental eye at . Charles squinted an autobiographical eye down the barrelof himself to see if he rated membership in this breed . To begin with , Charles Swallow found scarcely anything in the world around him to approve of . The suit he had just pitched clown the laundry chute was totally synthetic ( were even the sheep any longer all-wool these days ? ) while his " hat " had been in reality derived from some legume grown in the Deep South ( which perhaps made it edible in case he ever lost an election bet and were required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes from the bath water to see the wallpaper , depictingpeople humorously caged in zoos of which the keepers were animals , that adorned the room . If standards were in visible declineon his own person and in his own house , they were inp5full rout in the world at large . The town rang with gimcrackery , human as well as material . There were the new owners of the old shore properties , people with allergies and two-toned cars , who had built swimming pools on the beaches . They sat around them eating frozen canapes and drinking gin-and-tonics with week-end guests who arrived on Thursday . The guests were those men from New York who ran things up the flagpole to see if anybody saluted , and their wives , metallic women with eyes like nickels who continually said " this . " This I like , this I understand , this I do n't get  --  surely one of the most irritating of locutions . Well , all this Charles Swallow deplored with a genteel scorn ( which a few intimates thought of rather as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life himself , to lay that ghost he had but to run down to New York for a day and drink it in in its present pure form . The Ritz was gone and the old Lafayette was gone , and as for the Algonquin  --  give it back to the Algonquins . Not that his home town of Decency , Connecticut , was n't headed in the same direction . Gone from the local ice cream parlors were the nickelodeons that may not always have worked but which were better than the jukeboxes efficiently spewing their garbage into the streets till dawn . The trolleys that had once meandered leisurely around town were now buses that got you straight to your destination in five minutes or less . Perhaps a subtler gauge of deterioration lay in the decline of reminiscence as such . He could remember a seagoing grandfatherwith a wooden leg , of the best teakwood , who had endowedthe local marine museum . He died in a burst of nautical jargon , having beheld the dawn of the psychiatric .

" But this was really his father 's memory ; his own was merelyp6his father himself , a man picturesque only in the number of magazines that had rejected his articles , substantial only for the philosophers from whom he had cribbed to write them . Once his father had taken him to New York to the theater . After the entertainment they had gone to an uptown restaurant where his father had grown expansive about the play , an old-fashioned drawing room piece which he had liked . " That was a real comedyof manners , without any funny business , " he had said , blowingcigar smoke in the boy 's face . Charles had never forgotten it . There are few smells more delightful than the rich , fullbodiedaroma of a fine Havana cigar provided someone else is smoking it . Puffing one personally only resulted in nausea for Charles , but he still liked the fragrance secondhand . The first thing he was going to do when his ship came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellows he knew did , but hire somebody to puff Havana cigars for him and blow the smoke in his direction . As much more vivid as his father 's recollections were than his own , his grandfather 's had been than that . He could remember a father who ran a chandler 's store on a waterfront still far from being improved by swimming pools , a pious figure with a gold toothpick in his pocket who quoted a brief portion of Scripture with every purchase of twenty cents or more . What , to complete the sorry cycle , would Charles 's own two sons have to look back on ? A man in a Brooks Brothers shirt mildly cursingchip shots on the living room floor . No . Nostalgia , as his Uncle Joshua had said , ai n't what it used to be . Which made it pretty complete . Nothing was what it used to be  --  not even nostalgia . Yet there were corners of his beloved Decency on which the blight of progress had blessedly not yet fallen . He loved to visit , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Matt among the rooms of his old Colonial house , bump/ing his head on the original beams and smelling Matt 's first editions ; or over the grounds , to savor the sights and scents of long-established verdure , grounds kept at least semiformal by ' Pony the gardener and his idiot son Bonaventura , who grinned obliquely at you as he dug up weeds with his bare toes . There were still , too , the Irish and Italian quarters of town into which the marauding antiquarians had not yet swept , whose residents , still reasonably benighted , compounded from herbs with names like oregano and life everlasting nostrums of a charming uncertainty , and whose sons still ate yeast for their pimples . They always would . And there would always be Hallburton Hill , where folk of gentle birth still wet their finger before turning a page , a custom that has all but vanished from the human scene .

There had been in youth a time when he had expected rather more from his typewriter , but he had settled for the realities  --  which was one way of propitiating the Furies . He ran a question and answer column . That was , simply , that . He did not yield to this destiny grudgingly but with a will ; since we must all fall into a category it might as well be head first . All in all , it was a good life . His lines were laid in pleasant places and his heritage was fair . Life now had a felicitous monotony , bland as poundcake , of which the featurelessdays were the slices dropping with soothing regularity from the loaf of Time . Yet there came to him sudden , inexplicable forebodings  --  hunches that Life might not yet have made its peace with him . That there might lurk somewhere yet a still unsettled account . IIe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it unfinished business , that seemed to chill the water in which he sat . He quickly nudged over the " hot " tap with his great toe . Whichp8corrected the liquid temperature but not yet the freezing intimationwith which he had been mysteriously struck . The premonitionof events about to catapult him into another literary key , the fear that Something was going to Happen , was so overpoweringthat it routed out all his other thoughts . It invaded , like the thunder of an approaching tidal wave , the pleasant plash of reminiscence . What key ? As the water drummed into the tub he quickly and rather frantically reviewed the rules and unities of this Marquandian world into which he had so easily issued himself a life membership , as in one of the better clubs , to check once more his qualifications for it . What was it ? It could be defined as a Paradise without a serpent . But there was always , in the Marquandian apple , a worm . Be it a secret concealed in the rosy pulps of respectability or merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger scale , the Cost of Success ( the price of money )  --  it was always there . What in God 's name could it possibly be in his case ? He had no money , so no one could be sending him a bill for that ; and since he was only a peripheral success ( as he was a peripheral New Englander ) he need fear no moral duns on that account . A gnawing discontent everyone had  --  even the dull clods in the novels of Knut Hamsun . Then it must be some secret come to haunt him from his past . But what ? Could it be something connected with what his wife had shouted , and was now shouting again through the closed door and the running water both , and that he had deliberately misheardthe first time ? Iie heard it clearly enough now . Crystal opened the door and called into the clouds of steam : " Do n't dawdle , for heaven 's sake . You 're late for Miss Appleyard already . " " Miss Appleyard ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick her up.  |p9What  do you think I 've been trying to tell you ? You may have t rouble finding her house because it 's way across town , so allow for that . Shake a leg , Chick . " The name , penetrating his thoughts at last , scattered them like a truncheon dispersing a host of idlers . The wheels of memoryspun ; whirled to a stop . He sat erect in the tub . " Sweetie Appleyard ? " he said . " Surely not her . Surely not Sweetie . " " Miss Appleyard is all the name the agency gave me . And the address . " Crystal opened the medicine chest and unscrewed the cap from a jar of cream . " Seven something Beacon Street . I 've got it jotted down there . I think it 's seven-eighteen . " " That 's her . That 's Sweetie . " He laughed  --  a chuckle of relief as well as of recall . Then that was all there was going to be to it . A flashback . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more Marquandianthan that ? Yet as he squeezed out the lathered sponge and felt the suds trickle down his back , he was n't so sure he was sure .. . Not all flashbacks are Marquandian , and this might be not the present flashing back at all but the past bolting forward , a missile held in long suspension and now shot from the abruptly let-go spring of time to meet you as you flew in antic retrograde to meet it , that name plucked out of all happenstance to exactnot contemplation but its opposite , the reluctant recapitulationof all lost years , yourself a target with no less velocity than the arrow streaking toward it in bland outrage even though you knew it was already quivering in its mark , coming in monstrous javelinlike amplification both of speed and size through the clearing chiaroscuro of vapor billowing in violent dispersal through the open door , scattering now and possibly forever the ephemeral scented soaps and steams of old assumptions  --  My God , what kind of stuff was this ! He sat up in the tub now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thenp10what was it ? he asked himself shakily . What ominous vein was this in which his mind was running , in which it had galloped off of itself ? He could place it vaguely but  - -  Could the Marquandian device of recapitulation misfire and , like a bungled rocket take-off or a bit of magic gone awry , land you in another world ? Clear in that of , for instance .. . No . He could n't say it . It would be too awful . He wanted to stay in this world he knew , that enveloped him like this warm bath . The worm was serpent enough for him ! Yet he knew very well how plainly he was thinking it , the name he could n't , or would n't , say , even to himself . He knew all too well , now , what was happening to him.  |p11SO  you say you knew this girl in school ? " Crystal said , kneadingher hands with the cream as she stood watching him bathe twice as fast as before , the water agitated as though by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Well , I 'll be damned . Sweetie Appleyard turning up after all these years as a sitter for my children . " Ile shook his head with that readiness for trite philosophy that the slightest sign of rhythm of pattern in our lives inspires . " It 'll be like old times . " " How old ? " She flipped an electric switch with that effect of languor in which women cage their howling curiosities , letting in light as she had air , dispersing the gloom along with the steam in which he might for the moment have preferred to remain wreathed , the light imploding on his senses as the name had upon his memory . He averted his head long enough to gnash his teeth for this as for all human bother , softening it into a smile as he said , " Well now , I ca n't have seen her since . . . let me sec . . . She used to visit a grandmother who lived on our street , and as children we played among the flowers and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchard boughs and all that jazz . Time passed . We found ourselves in the same grade forone year when they rearranged the school districts . Perhaps it was the eighth . Queer sort of girl , always running off into the woods and reading poetry . It must be ten years since I 've seen her . Does n't she ring any kind of bell , lambswool ? Beth Appleyard ! That was her name . " " Wait a minute . Is n't that the girl there was some scandal about in high school ? Do n't tell me . " She put her hand to her brow like a medium in a trance , the light catching her bracelet , which had that look serene benedictive and forlorn that inheritedjewelry has . The hand came down . " She cheated in an oratorical contest . " " You 're right ! I forgot about that . She got clear to the nationalfinals with a speech lifted bodily from Daniel Webster . Horrible embarrassment in Washington , finals were to be in the Senate . But there she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train platform with her arms full of flowers and her straw hat over her eyes . She had n't known entries should be original and not assembled from available material . ' How the principal must have slaved over that statement . That was our district champ . That was our Sweetie . " " Would n't it be a lot later than eighth grade ? Yes , the contestwas high school . And if you saw her ten years ago , it 'd be even after that . When we were going together . " " Her grandmother hovers over my memory like a particular phantom , " he said with that anger savage and defunctive of a cornered rat , thinking I do n't mind being the rat driven through numberless doors behind one of which lies food , but I 'll be damned if I 'll be the food too . " The Applcyards and the grandmotherwere always exchanging visits , in those far-off childhooddays , so we got to know the old woman too , God rest her . Well , she had a dog that chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? Why should I lie to you ? " " I do n't know , but every time you do you start this nervous gibbering . " Crystal stood wringing her buttered hands with thep13most ludicrous air of portent , as though minding the theft , abduction , lust and murder with which the term " sitter " is latterly encrusted . The sitter is our latest American folklore , he told himself , who told himself also do n't holler till you 're hurt , but whose foreknowledge that he was going to be hurt was the same as being hurt already , the wound and the wretched wriggling to elude it one . " And you could n't possibly have forgotten that oratorical scandal . Why did you pretend to ? Changing the subjectinstead to those densely wooded areas you say she went to read poetry in  --  " " I did n't say densely wooded areas  --  I said in the woods . Densely wooded areas is a tabloid cliche for where girls ' bodies oh never mind . " " I know . But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield this Lovey as you call her ? " " Sweetie . It was her nickname . Her name was Elizabeth , I imagine . Her grandmother 's name was Rodriguez or Bonheur or something like that , which was typical of the baroque strain that ran rather deeply in that family . So get ready . You know writers tell us that children 's perceptions arc the purest ? Well , the first glimpse I got of the grandmother , it struck me that her fingers were like fried bananas . And I knew that if she had any legal documents they would be upstairs in ginger cans . That sort of thing . " " What about Sweetie ? " " Get the Faulknerian quality about this grandmother first , lion , and hence about that house from whose commingled bloods she , Sweetie , had been vatted out of all flesh and time ; get what your correspondent saw in the grandmother in the very instant of her coming into the coalbin for us  --  the voluminous skirts imploding on our sight with the same violence as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure Faulkner : ornate , ramshackle , vertiginous and fine . " " What were you two doing in the coalbin ? "  | " Wait . Because I want you to know everything , so you 'll know , no matter what anybody else may tell you or insinuate , " he said , again with that savage defunctive anger . He knew as he rolled his eyes away that they had that shabby vestigiality of gnawed olives . " Get the idea of what I may have divined in that instant of shocked cognition ; that all this  --  the documents yellowingin the ginger cans among the rotting ancestral lace and the suffocating potpourri , together with the imploding light and the horrible dark brown fried bananas  --  would one day burst into flower to win the Nobel Prize for Literature . That maybe she knew it too , without knowing she knew . Not just he but both of them there , locked in coeval fear and trust in the violated gloom . Doing in the coalbin ? " he called through the open door through which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages riffled in sibilant outrage or anyhowexasperation or maybe both . " Why , reciting poetry more than likely . What else would anybody be doing in there ? Becauseyou see , Sweetie was one of those for whom beauty burns like incense in a million urns . To quote Teasdale . Remember how I used to recite Sara Teasdale to you before we were mar-ried ? " " Passing on to me what you had no doubt got from her . Whispering in my ear what she had in yours . " " Now you 're doing it ! The Faulkner . Now you 're getting the hang of it . That repetition at once woozy and serene , sick with overimplication  --  " " Oh , stop this idiotic rubbish ! " she said , turning around . " And stop trying to throw me off the scent with all this hankypanky , Charles Swallow , the way you always do . " He loved her when she used both his names like that not only because it went with towns of from ten to twenty-five thousand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because it made her once again the girl next door . Not here . " At least in myp15house we recited poetry in the parlor . We did n't go down in the coal cellar . " " You forget one thing , " he said . " You had oil heat . " He got to his knees and began lathering his midst with the same defunctive frenzy , thinking it 's all right to unearth mummiesand maybe even haul them up into the light of day but not to unwind the cerements in which they have lain and in which could they but speak they might themselves prefer to lie . Thinking too , who thought all this , I have more to forgive than be forgiven for but I can never let her know it . Because the wallpaperwas her idea . The wallpaper with the zoo switch . Whimsy , of all sins the most difficult of definition and the least susceptible to reform , was to be forgiven daily and thereby daily unforgettable . He took in a scene over the corner window in which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap of officialdom , was eating his lunch in the noonday sun , a detail on which the ache of allegory lay keenest . A simian dressed in blue flannels and Homburg was thrusting a banana at a caged executivetype . Swallow gorged himself on grievance till she was hopelesslyin his emotional debt . Then he said : " When I talk about when I saw ' her last , I only mean visually . So let 's stop this bone-grinding . She may have been putting flowers in somebody 's mailbox , or shattering stars by walking through a rainpool . Because that was Sweetie Appleyard  --  lovingBeauty every minute . If she had two loaves of bread she would sell one and buy a hyacinth . I-Ier oranges were as sweet as the king 's , and so on . She 'd phone to call your attention to the sunset , then when you called her back after stepping outsideto look at it she would n't come to the phone . " " Playing hard to get . " " Oh , my God . " He rolled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wallpaper . " She could n't come to the phone . It was more beauty than she could bear . Now do you under/stand it ? " Ile squatted in the tub , reaching for the obscene sponge . " So the thing that 'll be interesting to see is whether she still is . " " Still is what ? " " One of those for whom beauty burns like incense in a millionurns . " " She apparently has n't married , if it 's ' Miss ' Appleyard . " Crystal stooped to retrieve a bobby pin . " Was there anything , I mean has she ever been disappointed in love , as they say ? " " Our good friend Nickie Sherman would say you had to be married to be that , now , would n't he ? " he said , smiling affectionatelyupward . " You 're as slippery as that bar of soap , are n't you ? But I think I may have you figured out by this time . " She bent down and kissed him . " You tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't possibly believe it , in hopes that I 'll think there was n't anything to it at all and not believe what there may be . Is n't that right ? " " You 're pretty sharp yourself , and moreover your breasts are like two doves nesting in quiet places . Stay bending over me a minute  --  it looks like mighty pretty country down there . Why do we have to go out tonight ? The question is rhetorical  --  a mating cry . " " Well , there wo n't be any place to go but bed when we get home , now , will there . That 's rhetorical too . " " Is that a promise ? " " More or less . But the Groteguts said eight , and we 're supposedto pick up Nickie and Lila on the way , so hurry . " She rose and bustled into the bedroom . " Right . But as for broken hearts for Sweetie , she had them every day , is what I 'm trying to say . So do n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand bits . They do n't make them like that any more . "  | " Yes , well , you really must get a move on . It 's after seven now , and if I have a new sitter to brief and all . . . Would you rather I went for this Miss Apple Strudel ? " " No , " he said , springing quickly out of the tub . He drew the plug from the belching drain with his toe as he reached for a towel , recovering his balance with one foot on the mat . " I think maybe it 'll be best if I do that , " he added , and began to dry himself briskly.  |p18As  he set forth with all speed to Beth 's house , Charles bethoughthimself of the works of Jane Austen , in which he had by felicitous chance been but recently refreshing himself , as was his wont once in a twelvemonth . His purpose in so doing was more than to clear his mind and restore his sanity , urgent as these motives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been visited , of Beth and himself dallying under the summer boughs with a volume of this author . The picture , if but sedulously dwelt on , must surely expunge from their bond all implication of guile ! In a larger sense , Charles was striving to put Beth herself into focus as a Jane Austen heroine , or at least a girl who might since last seen conceivably have flowered into one . Imputing to her such wholesomeness must definitively exorcise all taint of blame , from which he likewiseardently longed to purge himself of any connection . There were some small means in the Appleyard family , flowinglargely from the grandmother , on her fair portion of which Beth might reasonably presume , and any young man of amorousintent reckon with in turn . Her reappearance as a sitter became therefore doubly an enigma . Of that alloy of human emotions , gold , however , our young friends were as yet blessedly unaware in the years when their companionship began . Thosep19were childhood days , when they had scooped polliwogs from the millpond or picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaped with sunkissed fruit or tadpoles congregated in obscene educational sacs , depending on the season . What sport they 'd had in the orchard ! Charles remembered arriving with a baseball bat one Saturday afternoon in autumn , and their going wild among the windfalls , smiting apples in all directionstill the trunks were spattered with pulp . Beth had flung the bat into the laden boughs at last and run for the river that coiled away behind the house , screaming with pleasure . Childhood ecstasies gave way to the more complex and literaryones of adolescence , embodied in images of Beth reading Shelley on the riverbank , or in the treehousc in the maple that spread its leaves over the gurgling stream , or pinking off unsteadilythe nocturnes of Chopin at their parlor " grand . " Once she threw herself into the open piano and embraced its strings . Though an " aesthete , " in the mode of those days , and committed to beauty in all its forms , he had felt this to be a trifle overshot , the hum of the ravished wires unsettling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in , and his tastes to shift rather toward those that would bear the scrutiny of the boulevards . There was also the other misgiving , which not even the most avowed fldneur could dismiss : whether a girl who habitually pitched herself into musical instruments would make a good wife and mother , let alone housekeeper . IIcr father once protestedthe presence of marigolds in his salad , though in all fairnessto our heroine it was a question whether they represented a literal obedience on her part to the E. E. Cummings injunction to " eat flowers and not be afraid " or whether those poor blooms had merely depended onto his plate from one of the rather disheveledcenterpieces with which his daughter was wont to garnishthe familial board . Friends and family by no means exhausted the range of those who had their lives enriched by Beth against their wills . In sum/mer , she would climb into the elms that shaded the city streets and from there drop , one by one , upon dismayed pedestrians below , pages torn from the book of verses with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this not only with school anthologies but also with volumes drawn from the public library , on the ground that showering the citizenry with beauty outweighed the mutilation of public property entailedthereby . However , the librarians failed to appreciate this reasoning and eventually revoked her card and even barred her from the building . She was usually barefoot , and usually clutchingan old beaded bag apt as not to contain a spray of laurel or pink , or a night moth , or a soft caressable gopher , rather than the keys and coins carried by the less imaginative for openingdoors and paying fines . It is a question whether her love for all living creatures extended to her mother , a gaunt pale woman who was generally to be seen bent over a sinkful of dishes or a steaming kettle in canning time . She was preserving the family fortune , she would have explained in that famously humorless tone of hers . When asked to lend a hand , Beth would answer with a vague shake of her head that pleaded impalement on some sensation too exquisiteto deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she would say with a helpless gesture , if it were a record she was listening to , or " Millay " if a cloud of poetry in which her spirit was afloat , a cloud far more impenetrable than the kitchen steam that wreathed her mother 's fading form , though not physically discernible . That was the idea . ' What effect all this had on Mrs. Appleyard is not known to man : she kept her counsel . But it got to be a nuisance to a young blade bent , as Charles was in the years of which we are now speaking , on the normal perquisites and pastimes of " dates . " Love verses and erotic operatic duets were not , in however glutting quantities , enough.  |p21It  was their custom to go to Hickett 's apothecary for sodas , and once when Christmas was approaching Beth asked what he should have liked in his stocking . " I want what 's in yours , " he told her with all the worldliness of sixteen . Mr. Hickett , a short nerve-ridden man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeballs , gave , on hearing this , a specially deploring , suffering version of this feat . Wiping fixtures behind the soda fountain at which they tarried , he rolled his eyes up till they seemed to vanish in his skull , fluttering his lids the while and twisting his mouth in a kind of outraged astonishment that such conversation could be held at all , let alone in his store . Nevertheless he hovered in their vicinity , powerless not to eavesdropfor more of what repelled him . " Charles , you 're so physical , " Beth averred , poking her soda with her straws . " For a girl who likes love poetry , " he said , groping toward some fresh outrage for Mr. Hickett , for to Outer le bourgeois was then the order of the day , " you certainly shy away from the subject . You fancy yourself some kind of Aphrodite sprite , so why all this skittishness when it comes down to brass tacks ? " " Aphrodite never married , " was the terse reply . " She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were watching him intently , but it was hard to tell , for they were far from lined up . One was always applying to the other for counsel . Charles enjoyed tormentinghim in the same way he had his father , whom his epigramsand paradoxes drove to distraction . " I may be old-fashioned , but I still like the phrase pure as the driven snow , ' " Beth went on . " I like being pure as the driven snow . " " Where would you like to be driven tonight ? " our swain asked , and snickered . " Oh , Charles , do n't be so absurd ! You 're a sensitive person.  |p22You  have standards . Why do you always have to espalier the bourgeois , or whatever you call it ? Why exaggerate the physical in this immature way ? " " It 's not we who exaggerate the physical , it 's you Puritans . For what is chastity , " he said , pushing his soda aside and tappinga Mclachrino cigarette on the lid of its box , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chastity but an overemphasison sex ? " Mr. Hickett 's eyeballs disappeared . And the contortion was followed by his slamming the wadded washcloth down on the counter as hard as he could and walking to the back of the store , where he vanished in the depths of the prescription department , presumably to take something for his stomach or head . Charles 's " paradox " had been , of course , in the then burgeoningboulevardier tradition aforementioned , which had its headquarters on quite other premises than Mr. Hickett 's . It was at the Greek 's that the cafe-minded set foregathered . It was to the Greek 's that Mr. Hickett 's fit of temper had implied the youth should take his custom . He was right . And Charles saw something else as made incontrovertibly plain : that if he hesitatedto take this girl to the Samothrace ( the Greek 's ) for fear of ridicule by his more worldly friends , why , then she was not his " speed " nor he hers , and their relationship were best terminated . Before Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a congealing bond . Besides , he was seeinganother girl named Crystal Chickering . Charles had a date with Beth the next evening , in the course of which she made a mysterious statement . " You ought to know why I 'm skittish about sex , " she said . He thought nothing of it at the time because she was forever talking in riddles ; besides , she herself hastily dug out a record album and set Tristan and Isolde spinning on the gramophone . She hovered near it , refusing to come nigh the settle on which he lurked , both arms spread along its back whilst the smoke of successive Melachrinosp23issued from his nostrils . After an hour of this he simply rose , got his hat and walked out of that house . She did not even sense his departure . He left her standing beside the ever-grinding machine , reverently murmuring " Wagner . . . " That was the last he ever saw of her . Until tonight , when he was doomed to confront her again in the unexpected role of sitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate was unchanged . It was the white cottage with the listing porch choked with wistaria that he had always remembered though never seen since , it being in a part of town into which neither business nor private purpose took him . One can live and die in a city of a hundred thousand and not see more than a handful of its streets . A sound of eccentric but skillful piano music drifted through the open door as he mounted the three porch stairs , causing him to reflect that Sweetie had at least notably improved her playing in the interval . ( Had a dream of the concert stage all the while been secretly inflaming her ? ) But when he reached the screen door and looked inside , he saw that the music was issuing from the same old phonograph , or a successor , before which she stood listening in the same attitude . IIe raised a hand t o the brass knocker also remembered of old , thus reassembling a familiar tableau . He let the screen door swing to again after opening it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had her back to the door . He opened the screen door and rapped again , more loudly . " Khatchaturian . " Whether this was progress remained to be seen . Certainly headway had been made in the matter of taste , of modernity , but she was rooted in the exact same spot in which he had left her more than a decade before , as though she had spent thep24interval neither eating nor drinking but only imbibing ethereal impressions . Even the dress she had on was the same , though that may have been an illusion cast by an old and apparently incorrigible addiction to white , and a way of always managing to look like a child playing grownup , with frocks of excessive length and chaotic fit that appeared to have been delved from attic trunks . She was barefoot . " Sweetie ? " He peered through the screen door , shading his eyes . She turned . She turned by degrees , like those actresses who expose the secrets of their craft . Then she floated toward him in the half-light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's me , " he said . " Chick Swallow . " The process of recognition was , for Sweetie , one with the strain of incredulity , as well as of eviction from a trance . A smile dawned across her face as she pushed the screen door open with one hand and with the other drew him in . " So you 've come back . " A slight chill went up his spine as the screen door twanged shut behind him . " You 're our sitter for tonight , " he said . " Oh , yes . Father said something about giving my name to an agency . " " It 's kind of late . So if you want to pop into a coat . . . " She raked him from head to foot in the darkening vestibule , taking in every detail of his appearance . " So they 've done it to you , " she said . " They 've put you in a blue serge suit and tie to match , and shiny shoes to go to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from nine to five , behind a desk piled with papers for you to do things with before they take them away again to other people . " Sweetie 's " they " had always referred to the forces of convention , the materialist hordes who ran the world and to whose gross standards finer spirits must ever , in the end , capitulate . Itp25was paranoiac in nature but was applied on behalf of others as well as herself  --  all who combined to form a sort of beleagueredand perceptive Few . The powers in question had , in his case , it was clear , " won . " " Well , you have n't changed , Sweetie . " IIe could not get over the dress , whose ill-fitting flamboyance recalled the shapeless folds in which Ophelia is depicted taking leave of her senses on the legitimate stage . It could all but have been a set of draperies plucked from a window in passing . Iler face had n't aged a whit , but resembled still a nerve-gnawed doll . It was to the great length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high school , claiming they prevented her seeing anything in the microscope . However , they had probably aided her passage through many another course . Shc fluttered them now as she reached to shut off the Khatchaturian . IIc was about to repeat that it was late and suggest a speedy departure and a resumption of the discussion on the way when something struck him with the force of a hammer on an anvil . Behind such piping hot romanticism was all too often somethingstone-cold . What she had been lost in clown the years was that lute-embodied , verse-bemused , high gutless swooning based on the illusion and maybe even belief that flesh could be reproducedwithout recourse to flesh ; that you could multiply arms and legs and smiles and tears and hands and feet but without sex organs . Because now the Faulkner came roaring back with twice the fury , and who had been plucked out of New England and dumped clear in the middle of Yoknapatawpha County was now picked up out of nineteenth-century Surrey England and clumped in the middle of it . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austen but not even Bronte , but because he had simultaneously heard on the carpeted stair a tread that memory or instinct or maybe just fear identified even before his eyes turned to take it in , a step secretive and sibilant made by the polished shoes he probably remembered too , as he did thep26creased trousers , tweed coat and Ascot under the bland debonairface , a face that flashed from him to her a smile that moved so smoothly from courtesy to possession as to warn him of something in this house not just eccentric but worse . So is it Mississippi or Massachusetts incest I 'm u  --  against ? The query roared along his bones , who reminded himself that there was Northern Decadence as well as Southern , the Puritan wintry hold-in as well as the semitropical let-go ; so I still do n't know but what it 's Marquand after all  --  his mind swinging violently between the two extremes like the needle of a butcher 's scale on which a joint of meat has been flung for weighing . " Hello , Daddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appleyard was a man of light construction in his middle fifties . He combined what he himself obviously took to be a seasoned charm with a dryness of tone felt to be Anglo-Saxon . He lingered on the second stair to greet Swallow , perhaps for that interval to repair the disadvantage in height , extending one hand while the other remained in his coat pocket . The effect was a sinister geniality like that of those educated gangsters in bygone films , often depicted as emerging from book-lined hideaways to conduct , with as little loss of aplomb as possible , the necessary chores of violence . Sometimes the components of this blend in Appleyard were separately discernible ; thus for minutes on end the learned charm would prevail in a smile turned up to full wattage , like Adlai Stevenson being acclaimed in distant lands ; then that mask would drop and the smile turn taut , a secretive grin predicated on information about you which he happened to possess . In this constant shifting from one identity to the other he resembled those faces in drugstore windowswhich give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passer-by , according to whether one has or has not taken the nostrum being advertised . It was at any rate as Adlai Stevenson that Appleyard led himp27by the arm into the living room , after Sweetie had scuttled off in some direction , presumably to put on shoes . " I remember you now , knocking about Granny 's house as kids , " he said , withdrawing the hand from the pocket to reveal in its grasp nothing more lethal than a pipe . " And then doing parlor duty ' as I think you young bloods called it then . " " Not me . " " But somehow my most vivid memories are those when you were kids . Always racketing about , here or in Sweetie 's grandmother'shouse . I was at Granny 's one summer trying to get a book done in the attic . Vain dreams ! I could hear you clear down cellar . By the way , was n't there a bit of a ruckus down there one day ? " he said , his grip tightening perceptibly on the other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of KrafftLbingto hear Granny tell it . " " No-o , " he answered modestly , smiling at the floor . " Nothing like that . " Things were falling into place at the same time that they were going utterly to hell . He remembered clearly now the fiasco on which Appleyard had been engaged in the attic , a life of Woodrow Wilson that had come to naught . Then he had run for mayor of Decency , waging a " literate " campaign . However , the application of Wilsonianidealism to the problems of garbage removal and road repair had struck few voters as possessing any great relevance , and he was defeated . Then for a while he owned a local movie house where he had gone bankrupt showing photoplays of distinction . A string of such misfires had no doubt done much to develop his acrid strain . He finally took some money settled on him by the grandmother and put it in , of all things , a bauxite mine in France , where the grandmother had come from . ( What was her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The investmenthad prospered , permitting Appleyard the life of cultivatedleisure to which he felt by nature entitled . He spent ap28great deal on his wardrobe , in which the pitiless recurrence of checks proclaimed him the man about town . " What , exactly , happened down cellar ? " Appleyard asked , straightening with his heel a rucked rug . " Well , the thing was , Granny was a terrifying figure to us kids , but amusing nonetheless . There 's a kind of grim humor in what I 'm going to tell you . " Appleyard 's face set itself into an exemplification of the formerhalf of this quality , leaving the other to illustrate the latter . He chewed the cold pipe in his bright teeth , and sucking on it in that state drew from it an occasional death rattle . " She 'd go around the kitchen with a fly swatter swatting flies , and when we kids did something to annoy her , she 'd reach over and swat us with the swy Hotter too . I mean the fly swatter . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left at the flies , then with no warning giving one of us a flick on the hand , and going on swatting flies . She had a kind of authority . Call it an imperial something , that went out with her era . Everything she knew died with her . We shall not see her like again . " " Do n't be too sure of that , " Appleyard told him . " She 's still alive . " " Alive ! Where ? " He jerked a thumb at the ceiling . " Upstairs . " " But I thought . . . That funeral here some years ago ... " " Mrs. Appleyard , " Appleyard said with lowered eyes . " Her mother is still very much with us . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . I mean about Mrs. Appleyard . So her mother is still with us . My , my . How old is Granny now ? " " Ninety-three . " He whistled his appreciation , though the sense of eerie convergences , of accumulations and assumptions menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sense of a plot ,  |p29ten  years in the hatching , to hold him answerable , who at the same time thought : What is it they think they 're saying , that it 's my skeleton in their closet ar theirs in mine ? ... . Appleyard made a sudden nervous movement to the vestibule to make sure they were n't being eavesdropped on , there in the gloom , and returned , and straightening now a rug that needed no straightening , said , " I 'm sure she 'd love to see you again . She has all her wits about her , never fear . " His smile was momentarily maniacal , and the presence in his get-up of the Ascot added to rather than subtracted from the effect of menace confronting Swallow ; which was in part that of being up against someone " weak " who might by wildly misplacing responsibilityget things out of hand . " As you can see , our Sweetie has never grown up past a certain point , " he resumed with a smile of which the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did something happen to her , once , that frightened her permanently back into herself ? A sexual scare thrown into her at an early age ? Granny thinks now the incident in the coalbin may have had something to do with it . " " Rubbish , " he said , feeling a firm line was called for here . " I do n't even know what happened clown there . I 've forgotten the incident completely . What more proof do you want it was insignificant ? " " Insignificant for you , yes . But for a nervous , sensitive girl with a tendency to asthma  --  " " Now look here . It was her grandmother that frightened both of us . Because I suddenly remember it all very clearly now . She who scared the holy bejesus out of us . So if you 're looking for a villain , how about thinking of her ? Has that been given any thought ? " " So you do remember the incident after all . " " That of being frightened , yes . Because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being caught there was in itself trau/matic . We were forbidden to go in there because of all the coal . " " What was the matter with the coal ? " " It was dirty . So get the picture . Those two in trembling complicity locked , clutching one another in the still unblasted dark  --  You 've read Faulkner , I presume ? " " Of course . " Because he suddenly thought now how he might get out of it . Not the thing 's being Faulkner  --  he could n't change that now , he was in too deep  --  but his taking the rap for it . Thinking : I 've got it now . It 'll be what it is only turned around : I wo n't let them hang it on me , I 'll hang it on them . " Because the thing has a kind of Gothic , Faulknerian quality . So all right then  --  here we go . The children locked in that conspiratorial dark while overhead and then outside the coalbindoor the footsteps come , and the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches for the latch , the feet and hands blended in that amalgam of familial power , that matriarchial Menace of which this is the one single feared avatar ; and then the door swinging slowly open and for that suspended second the two still quivering in the still unblasted dark ; and then the detonating light , revealing the shocked materialized old face beneath the upraised arm and the fingers like fried bananas still fumbling the light cord though the light cord has been pulled , the bulb itself dancing in frantic antic **25;620;TOOLONG , disclosing , for her , the shocked one , the two innocents naked where they stand . " " Naked ? " " Not in the physical sense , but those clothes that covered them being themselves covered with dirt from playing in the hole so sternly disallowed them , naked the more to accusation and punishment . " Ile drew a deep breath and continued . " So that they know , those two , that the same hand that pulled the light string will on the instant draw them by the ear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upstairs and into thep31bathtub . And more . Because this may be the point , so get this if you get nothing else : By cackling insinuations about what that boy as ambassador of and from all dirty boys had intended should be done in that coalbin whether it had been done or no convincing the girl that dirt and the act adumbrated are forever one . Thus grinding into her mind what she was simultaneously scrubbing from her flesh  --  Filth . The old and primordial thought-muck . And locking her forever in that cloistral dream from which that sex who alone must waken her must by the same token be the one most powerless to deliver her . " He sank into a chair , breathing heavily . Appleyard dropped into another , likewise greatly agitated . He packed his pipe with tobacco now , but then set it thoughtfully on the arm of his chair . " It may not be all that simple . " " Aye-yi-yi ! " said the other , slapping his brow . " How can I make it any plainer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the picture again . That burgeoning and still unblackened trust  --  " " No , no , please . " Appleyard cut in with a wave of his hand . " Let 's not go into all that again . Let 's try to look at it from anotherpoint of view  --  Granny 's . I 'm afraid she wo n't know what you 're talking about if you take this line . She does n't know Faulkner . Granny , " he said , a faint smile playing across his lips , " reads Dickens . " " God . " The youth rose and gazed out the window . A weight descended on his spirit , settling like an incubus there whose force could not yet be judged and whose tenure none could tell . half an hour ago he was a free man . Now .. . " I see . So now it 's Miss Havisham in Great Expectations , a jilted virgin living out her days in a house where all the clocks stopped on the day the bridegroom never showed . Miss Havishamgoing slowly mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; fingering the dusty goblets and the tarnished flatware ; putting on her bridal robes never to be removed for any lover ; watching the cobwebs gather on the tall tiered cake rotting in its frosting , in that shut-off room which is for her a tomb of memories . Is that what Granny sees ? Is that the way it reads for Granny ? Is that what Sweetie is  --  or may become  --  and I the culprit ? Is that the way it is ? " Appleyard sighed unhappily into his interlaced fingers . There was a whisk of white on the edge of their vision , a pale streak running through the vestibule , a ghostlike fluttering of folds that was gone before they could turn their heads . All that remained was a cloud of smoke from a cigarette  --  which he suddenly rememberedshe 'd smoked then , each one as though it were her first . " She does seem to be , well , frozen in time , like the Miss Havisham to which you so quickly made comparison , " Appleyardsaid . " Sweetie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but she may very well have had Great Expectations of her own which  --  " " But she was undersexed ! She was against it , man ! " " Because of something that happened away back  --  " " Oh , poppycock ! " he said , pacing the room . " Why was n't this put up to me before ? I mean you sure waited a long time ! " " You know how those things are . What you see every day you do n't see at all , till one day  --  And what could we . . . ? You were married and  --  " " If it had n't been for this sitter business we might never have met again for you to lay it in my lap . " " That 's rather Dickensian itself . he creaked with coinci-dence . " " Just let me say this , apropos of Mrs.  --  of Sweetie 's grandmother . " He stood making a gesture which consisted in bringing the tip of a forefinger down into the other palm , like lost outdoorsmenletting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You say she 's ninety-three . Well , she 's probably addled . Remember how old people distort their memories . " " I would n't tell her that to her face , " Appleyard advised urbanely . " When you see her , as you certainly now shall  --  " He broke off and craned forward in his chair to look into the dark vestibule . A sound on the stair arrested them , both . Swallowlistened to it stockstill , steeling himself for a Victorian beldame in black bombazine whose Dickensian world of black and white excluded any question of moral grays . " Quick , does she have any other favorites ? I 'll never butter her up on Dickens . It 'll never wash . Does she read any others ? Quick ! " " She is passionately devoted to Proust . " " Sweet Christ in the morning . " There was a rustle of purple-black silk and a tiny woman clutching a massive cane appeared from the shadows . She seemed at first a mere solidification of the gloom from which she emerged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen to possess a clear particularity , hatchctlike , with a face of the sort known as aquiline  --  though this derived from an incisive gaze more than from any cast of feature . " I think you remember Mme. Piquepuss , " Appleyard said . " Granny , this is that Charles Swallow . " She extended a thin claw which he took while trying to place her , for he did not think now that he remembered her at all . Ile would certainly not have recognized her on the street , or tumbled to her name . Perhaps he had never clearly heard that . She stood scrutinizing him also for memorable detail , and seeming to find none , said with a faint twitch of her lips : " So . " " You 're still the same , " he answered with the shred of a smile . " I remember you always had such sensitive hands . I was recalling to Mr. Appleyard how you 'd smack us with the fly swatter , " he continued with a glance at the stick on which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? "  | " You must come and see us again very soon , " Mme. Piquepusssaid with an abruptness suggesting that he had succeeded in definitively boring her in twelve seconds and was being sped on his way , until another rustle in the hallway made him divine her deeper purpose : that she wished all too firmly to see him on matters best discussed out of earshot of their subject , who now materialized with the wraithlike quality typical of this house . All the huggermugger was getting on his nerves . " We really must go , " he said to Sweetie , who had slipped , still barefoot , up to her father and handed him a rose . He put it in his trouser-pocket . " You 've got to get a move on , " Appleyardsaid . " Have you had anything to eat ? " " I have a hunger food is gall to , " said Sweetie , who always quoted from the best . Appleyard sighed . " She can have a bite at my house , " Swallow said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to catch her , " Appleyard said , for Sweetie had again glided from view . That rang a bell . For many years local artists had seen in her romantic possibilitiesas the Goose Girl or the Milkmaid , and thus it was that painters and illustrators , themselves representing versions of dishevelment , were often seen gesticulating down to the river shouting offers of employment , only to see her dive into the water and reappear , all Nereid , on the opposite bank to taunt them . Or clamber up the maple into the treehouse . " Let 's just forget it , " Charles said . " We can call the agency and get another  --  " " No , " said Appleyard , whose idea it had been that she try a bit of sitting . But it was not he who brought matters to a resolution . Mme. Piquepuss marched into the vestibule . Taking a positionat the foot of the staircase up which Sweetie had whisked , she began flailing the newelpost with her stick in a manner thatp35chilled Charles 's blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a head out of which she were bashing the brains . It was clearly a tested means of bringing the girl round , for here she came down the stairs like a summoned child , pouting and smelling yet another rose . " She 's an Emily Dickinson without talent , " Appleyard declared . He grasped Swallow by the arm again and wheeled him back into the living room for a last word while the grandmother got Sweetie into some sort of sartorial shape . " Now do n't stay out too late , " he told Swallow , with the first show of authority the latter had seen him make . " Get back by eleven , or twelve at the latest . " " Yes , sir . And do n't worry , because the boys are reliable . They 'll get her out of the house in case of fire or anything . " " Good . And one more thing . Do n't let her make you pay her in things of the spirit , like books or flowers . Make her take money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweetie was seated on a Shaker chest while Mme. Piqucpuss wedged high-heeled shoes on her feet . The elder stood with her back to Sweetie and Sweetie 's foot between her legs , like a blacksmith shoeing a horse , tugging and grunting in a determined fashion . " I 'm most anxious to see how this sitting thing works out , " Appleyard said . " We must all work together to get Sweetie out of her shell . " " She needs some responsibility , is what she needs . " Appleyard suddenly transferred his scrutiny from the hall to Charles . " Say , this advice column you run in the Picayune Blade  --  what 's the name of it again ? " " The Lamplighter . They wo n't hear of changing the name , though of course the old-fashioned banalities are a thing of the past . We use the psychological attack today , and I 'm trying to get subtlety O.K. 'd by the front office  --  "  | " That 's just what I was thinking  --  the psychological . By George , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never thought till just now  --  helping people with their problems is your job . " He squeezed Charles 's arm in an access of optimism . " We 'll keep in touch . " Sweetie wobbled uncertainly on the high heels as , snatching up a beaded bag , she started for the door . Was it the same old beaded bag as always ? Very possibly . A normal-looking flannel coat muffled the note of romanticism struck by the dress , though her unsteady legs  --  which necessitated Swallow taking her arm like a more experienced ice skater supporting a beginner with weak ankles  --  restored to their passage across the porch and down the stairs the element of the unusual . Sweetie looked more than ever like a girl playing grownup . A family watching from a porch across the street gave him the momentary feeling of " doing a fine thing , " though where they imagined he was taking her God only knew . They crossed the lawn and climbed into the car to additional shouts of encouragement from the elders . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , a telephone begin insistently to ring . " Tell Mrs. Swallow we 're on our way ! " he called as , slipping the car into gear , he shot off down the street like a madman.  |p37SO  we have the story of a man who wanted to settle down and be a comfortably-off Marquand character for the rest of his days but could n't because of something Faulkncrian in his past . So far so good . Or bad . The problem was how to get back . Back to the literary key from which he had been so violentlytransposed , the world from which he had been so shatteringlydispossessed , or , failing that , the compromise world in which he might settle in between . Mme. Piqucpuss was a formidablefigure and a Proustian phase might be indicated for brief intervals and for the unthinkable . Likewise sustaining the Faulknerianpitch for the rest of his days : he would rather end them now  --  removed , cauterized out of the old and tragic flank of the world . For the moment , why not put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment herself quiescent in the front seat beside me . I figured that I might as well improve the interlude  --  to drop the third-person guise assumed in order to objectify as much as possible the inauguration of events relating all too dismally to myself  --  I figured I might as well take ad/vantage of the ten minutes ' ride to my house by studying my burden . Sweetie sat huddled against the door of the front seat as though on guard against unfriendly blows . Her great chocolate eyes , which watched me in silence as I drove , had the mute reproachof a street dog confident of its breeding in the face of widespread public disapproval , or hostility . Now and then she drew a gold locket back and forth across its chain with somethingof the apathy of the mad . I was glad to see her stop this and dig out of the beaded bag a comb and mirror with which she began to tidy her hair . " Is n't that the rear-view mirror from an automobile you 've got there ? " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its back surface . She stowed the paraphernalia back without answering my question , and settled over again in her corner . " I used to sing for you . " She spoke with a rueful air , leaving unclear whether what was to be regretted was the time when all this had occurred or the fact that it had . " I have awful pitch . " " That 's all right . I 'm tone-deaf . So that was always all right , Beth . " " Shall I sing something now ? " " No , do n't do that . " " Because we ca n't recall the past ? " I bore down on the accelerator , gnashing my teeth as we cut through traffic . " Whom did you marry , finally ? " Finally . Dear God , must the assumption that there 'd been a " triangle , " that I might still not have her " out of my system " and all the silly rest of it , add its weight to the sum of nuisances flapping like vultures about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever knew a girl named Crystalp39Chickering , " I said . " Her father was an advice columnist on the Pick . I married her , and I now conduct the column . " " I do n't place the girl but I remember the column now . Of course ! You 're the Muffin Man , or something like that . " She raised an arm to ward off my upraised hand , which I reached behind her to make sure the door against which she leaned was locked , as I often do with children riding in the front seat . " No , I 'm the Lamplighter , " I said . I mused rather sourly on my solicitude for one destined to do me harm  --  probably  --  a hunch that I now felt I had instantly had on hearing the name of the sitter in my bath . Sweetie took me in again with that air of evaluating not just myself but all life 's unabating dismal developments . " So they 've put you in a tweed cap with little teensy checks and set you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be one of us . Conform . ' They 've given you a house to keep up the payments on and an office with a typewriter to sit behind  --  you , Charles Swallow , who used to read Shelley to me  --  and set you to work turning out platitudes for morons . " " Odd as it may seem , a good many people arc helped by these platitudes , " I answered . " They write me telling me so , and thanking me for my advice . I 've even straightened a few lives out . How do you like that ? I could show you letters . " " What are some of the letters ? Not those you get thanking you , but the ones asking for help . " " Do n't you ever read the column ? " " I never read newspapers . What are some of the problems people have ? " " Well , today , for instance , I got a letter beginning , Dear Lamplighter : I know I can make my marriage work if I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become engaged to three chaps . For years I 've been after her to get a boy friend , like other girls , and get married . Now lo and behold shep40gets three , making the situation hopeless . Where do we go from here ? Is this what I deserve as a mother ? ' and so on . Cries of pain , pleas from the depths . Trying to help is a responsibility I take seriously . " " What will you write these people ? " " The first I 'll probably refer to the Bureau of Missing Persons , and then when she 's found her husband , most likely have them both in for a talk . The other woman is a different kettle of fish . I shall tell her quite frankly Madam , what prompts your daughter to acquire three fiances is a fear of marriage . She wants the situation to be hopeless , because as long as it is she 's free of the clutches of an institution you 've discredited for her as something to be nagged and chivvied into , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be undersexed  --  I would have to see her to find out . Please feel free to phone my office and make a date any time . ' So sneer all you want . I at least do my bit to try to relieve suffering humanity . You do n't know what goes on in the world , up there in your treehouse , Sweetie . " She tucked up the collar of her coat and shivered a little . " Maybe I know only too well , " she said . In the interval of silence in which we again drove , I felt I might have been a bit harsh with Sweetie ; to repair the mood that had fallen between us I resumed chattily in the vein of old-school-friend reminiscence that her query about my marriagehad in a sense generated . " Do you remember a girl named Elsie something ? Elsie Wayne I believe it was , " I said . " She took ballet lessons every Saturday morning at Mrs. Meyer 's . What ever happened to her ? " " They 've put her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . A little jail with pretty chintz curtains on the kitchen windows , and there they keep her very well . They 've put a broom in her hand and the last I heard she had four children.  |p41That  was several years ago . Did n't you have a sister named Lila ? What 's become of her ? " " Nothing 's become ' of her , Sweetie . Get over the idea that something becomes ' of all of us . Lila married Nickie Sherman , my old sidekick . " " Are they happy ? " , , very .  --  This was not true . But all truth is relative , and I felt that what was called for here was a corrective to Sweetie 's warped view of life , not an answer to her question . The problem was not whether the Shermans were happy but how to get Sweetie down out of the treehouse . I might as well begin on that now . It had been put on my docket . Urgency justified a false answer , one as false as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my work , though that estimate was precisely one I had made that afternoon to my wife when she had taken , against me , the line I had just taken against Sweetie . Unable to bear Crystal'sinsinuations that I had a good job and ought to be grateful , I had flung my shirt and tie across the bedroom and declared that I could no longer go on pumping out bilge for morons . Just as , when next I encountered the amused smile with which Nickie Sherman habitually greeted mention of my employment , I would defend its value against the vacuity of wastrels like himself . Fidelity to large truths often requires betrayal of small ones . " Do you know Nickie Sherman ? " I asked , suddenly seeming to remember Nickie 's having once described Sweetie as " the barefoot bluestocking . " But it must have been someone else , because she shook her head and said , " No , I do n't know him . " " Well , anyway , here we are at my house , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for us under the porch light . Its rays cast a shimmer into her cropped hair and along the brown silk ofp42her dress . She looked extraordinarily fresh and electric , up there , and I rejoiced in her appearance though it was one to which anger may have lent an additional sparkle . Overhead dangled a set of wind chimes we 'd picked up on a " second honeymoon , " motionless now in the numb June air but soon enough to be plucked loose and swept away by a hurricane . Crystal clattereddown the wooden stairs to greet us , the racket she made excessive , I thought , punitive . I opened the car door for Sweetie and we repeated our impression of two ice skaters one of whom was teaching the other . Her ankles buckled violently as she clutched my arm . " This is our sitter , dear , Miss Appleyard . My wife . " Slipping a pale hand into Crystal 's hospitable grasp , Sweetie conferred upon her mistress that measuring gaze which was both shy and presumptuous . The scrutiny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , the felicities of face and form by dint of which " they " had been able to snatch me from freedominto bondage , to translate me from the intellectual anarchiesof Shelley to that class of men who seriously purchase souvenirs like wind chimes for attachment to the front porch . Crystal sized Sweetie up in shorter order . Singularity is more easily pegged than normality , it being cloudless natures and clear facades that excite us to remarks like " I ca n't figure him out " or " She throws me , " while devious and even dastardly behaviorwe take in stride as understandable in the face of life 's complexity . Crystal had long ago ticketed the newcomer as a Nervous Girl while that girl was still imbibing the wonder of one able to look so spruce after a day in the Chintz Prison and to stand so affably poised on heels as high as her own . " I 'll introduce you to the children , and then we really must be off , " said Crystal and trotted toward the house , again with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate speed , not to be on anybody 's " side . " Sweetie wobbled up the stairs behind us , holding to the banister and developing a smilep43of anticipation for the adventure . I held the door open for her while Crystal galloped ahead and set up a shouting for the boys . Mike and Fillmore appeared and were introduced , then Crystal took Sweetie into the kitchen for the usual sitter 's briefing  --  phone numbers , where things were , and so on . Acting unhesitatinglyon her title , Sweetie sat . She opened her coat and asked , " What about antidotes ? I heard of a ... " I herded the boys into the nearby bedroom and gave them a few last-minute instructions . " Fix her a bite of supper , " I told Mike , who was just short of ten . " A sandwich will do and I think there 's some potato salad in the icebox . By no means let her turn the stove on or anything of that sort . If you want to call us , we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in bed by nine-thirty . Fill , see that Mike turns in by ten . Make sure Blitzstcin has water . All this will give you ninety units for the week . " " This one does n't seem very reliable , " Mike said , peering worriedly down the corridor toward the kitchen . " She 's funny . " " Read to her . Gain her confidence . We 'll keep in touch  --  and we 'll be back early . " I had a hurried drink in the living room , where , having finished with Sweetie , Crystal found me. 1lcr mouth tight as a scam , she beckoned me off with a jerk of her head that drew a flash of fire from her earrings . I marched behind her toward the front door . From the depths of the hall closet I felt a hand clutch my coat sleeve as I passed , and Sweetie whispered , " She 's right for you . " I drew her out and , shaking her roughly by the shoulders , said , " Stop talking nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away . Now there 's an end of it ! " Crystal was kissing the boys good-by on the porch , taking care not to soil herself . She spread a hand across a large bow at the neck of her dress . She looked like someone bending over a water fountain to drink . Sweetie watched through the screenp44door with that smile which found the occult in everyday things . Behind the house Blitzstein could be heard baying at the end of his chain  --  dragging his house another inch or two across the yard with each leap into the air . Irked by the error of his acquisition , I turned on the boys and said : " Do n't leave any telephones off the hook now , for heaven 's sake . If you do , I do n't know how many units I 'll take away . " We had extensions everywhere , including the laundry , which often resulted in people forgetting to cradle phones after passing a call on to someone elsewhere in the house , by means of a lot of co-operativeyelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy , etc . So that , though we had five telephones , we could rarely be reached . I sped toward the Groteguts ' with the same distraught haste as I 'd driven home in , though I dreaded getting there . Nickie had described the Groteguts ' dinners as food for thought ; big and boring and symptomatic of the divorce between social life and friendship . Crystal had called the Shamans , canceling the plan for us to pick them up , as a result of my delay in fetching the sitter . " What took you so long ? " They were her first words in the car . " We were talking about old times . " " How old ? " I reaffirmed my plan to check irrelevancies and all snowballingdamned nonsense , from whatever quarter , and to give clear notice of this . On the seat between us was a novel Crystal had borrowed from a woman who would also be at the party . Briefly waggling which , I said : " I Iow did you like this ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes ? I mean must we still have that ? And the way they keep referring to it as a profession . Marriage is regarded as a trade . "  | " Wonderful , " I said , taking honest pride in the quip . Was this the girl I married ? No , thank God ! She had come a long way from the provincial innocent I 'd courted to the rather waspishwoman of the world which a decade of marriage to me had made of her  --  no point in being modest about that . Of course her verbal humor was at its best when her mental humor was not , but that is the nature of wit , is it not ? " What else ? About the book . I know the man has a style as heavy as lead , but what else ? Pour it on , ducks . " " Oh , this so-called realism . " Crystal tilted the rear-view mirrorto get a look at her hair , and having done so , swiveled it back . " Is it ever anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm beginning to agree with that radio reviewer you intellectuals are always complaining about . I mean this book  --  they pop in and out of bed like seals in and out of water . They 're always in the sack . " " They overdo it , " I said , with a disagreeable feeling of " sellingout , " of capitulating to garden-club standards that made me avoid my reflection in the mirror when I gave it an extra twist of adjustment . " Why do modern novelists dish out so much sex ? Why have they always got everybody in the sack ? " " Maybe they do n't know the facts of life . " " Swell . Touche . Thou'st a nimble wit , I think it was made of Atalanta 's heel . " My spirits rose , Sweetie all forgot . I even let up on the acceleratora little , not to get to the Groteguts ' sooner than necessary ; to enjoy the cool , delaying ride . Crystal drew a stocking up and fastened a garter clasp . " You said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low old ? " I stepped on the gas . " There was never anything between us . " I gritted my teeth . But what answer would not have been idiotic ? It had been one of those questions to which no replyp46is adequate since denial ca n't be made without automatically implying a situation about which it can be said that there is nothing to it . " I love you , " I said loosely . " You know that . There 's never been . . . " I shifted up in the seat , gripping the steering wheel . I felt like the golfer in the comic strip who with every stroke digs himself the more deeply into the sandtrap from which he is trying to extricate himself . " Never been anyone else . . . " I was glad to see the Grotegut house loom into view , a situationwhich I should not have thought possible . My mood swiftly reversed itself on seeing the trap into which I had escaped . The Groteguts were the sort of whom Nickie was fond of saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so damn many of them around . The house was a bedlam , though of motionless occupants . The guests exceeded by half a hundredthe demonstrable maximum for a decent evening  --  say eight or ten  --  and stood vertically massed like passengers in a subway crush . Eager hostesses ought perhaps to have their living rooms posted with signs like those in commercial establishments which specify the number of persons occupancy by more than which is illegal . The chairs were all empty : they were inaccessible . A group near where I stood , hesitating before the plunge , was being well presided over by my boss 's rather muscular , oblongwife , the veins in whose neck swelled in mid-emphasis of some point . Behind her was a large leather couch , on which I longed to pitch forward and go to sleep . I spotted what I was looking for  --  Nickie at the other end of this room . I wanted a word with him , long enough to bring up Sweetie Appleyard 's name and see if it rang a bell . Snatching a highball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterer 's , I began the long journey to his side . To pass among a cocktail jam of this sort requires a specialp47kind of movement not unlike osmosis . One seeps and sidles through walls of flesh seemingly solid ; nor is passage ever straight but circuitous , as counterpressures carry one off course . Delays are unavoidable as faces familiar to one swim into view and require pauses for greeting and graceful extrication . A man named Harry Larkin , a funny-story-dispenser , materialized in my path , ready with three new ones . He was moon-faced and a shade too expansive , and just now had a heavy summer cold which gave new meaning to the term " infectious laugh . " I laughed dutifully at his three stories and oozed away to the left , and freedom . But not for long . Bearing down through heavy seas was the cultural freighter , Mrs. Adelaide Crcwes , who in a twinkling could be saying to you , " But do n't you think Tennyson . . . ? " By sagging at the knees I lowered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noodles in her shrug , till the danger was passed . One is , of course , contrarily , a chore to others . Two or three were visibly put out at having to take me into account . Knoedler , the German-born violinist who would play for us later , greeted my approach with an expression morose and even despairing . I hoped we would not get into politics , a subject on which he was aggressive without being informed . Ile had the thick shirts and high color of those who demand radical changes in government . What he did  --  with the obvious aim of scaling the encounter to my level  --  was to launch an account of a recentmotor trip in which he had encountered several dead chickenson the turnpike . When I showed no interest in this theme he seized my arm and said , " But these chickens were plucked and dressed ! " I thought of those film fantasies in which flocks of geese are plowed into by speeding airships to emerge , fully cooked , through the exhaust . Murmuring something about refrigeratorvans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman I knew slightly named Mrs. Lumpey was next . She discoursedmainly on the absence of her husband from these fes/tivities . " He has this peculiar pain in his stomach , " she said . " I do n't blame him , " I said , and inched off . I squeezed apologetically between a woman with brown lipstick and a man to whom she was telling a story , so that a fragment , perhaps the climax , lodged in my ear : " . . . and held that ear of corn up for the dog and turned it for him while he ate it ! " she said , grinning richly into my face . A caterer hove near with a bowl of that fish paste into which one is bidden to thrust a potato chip , the body of which then breaks off in the paste , leaving a small residue for one to raise , dry , to one 's lips . I declined the offering , which was by now replete with shards , and reached instead into my coat pocket for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Knowing what is served at these affairs , I often go to them armed with a supply of fresh nuts or even a few squares of Cheddar concealed on my person , on which to nibble privately . Such a practice is hard to justify , but it has become too habitual with me to give a second thought . I tucked a nut or two between my teeth and drank from my glass , which in the congestionI was obliged to hold at chest level , like a libation carried in an antique rite . To the conversational caldron , now deafening , was added the scent of mingled perfumes , growing steadilydenser in the warm air . Before me loomed the powdered shoulders , flecked with rust , of Mrs. Tolliver . She was a pretty woman of middle years who smelled , herself , deliciously of soap , and I paused a moment to drink her in , olfactorily speaking . She stood with a young divine , new to Decency , named Marmon . They were gnawing triangular canapes which looked like pimples on toast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fluent worldliness that struck me as a bit spurious . I had heard him preach at a recent service , " Let us load the camera of our heart with the film of the Gospel , and set the light meter of our spirit at Infinity . " So he seemed to me notp49quite the man to stand with a Martini saying , " Oh , really ? And the Hewitts , are they off to Rome for the summer ? " There was a note of imposture somewhere . I mopped my brow , I hoped with my own handkerchief , and raised my glass for another gulp . It was getting decidedly hot in there . The voices mingling into one Voice were now a physicalpressure applied to all the senses , a weight like water underseas , in which arms waved like dreamy fronds and teeth snapped at bright scraps dislodged from coral reefs by the pulse and thrust of the tide , or at twitching fish reconstructed back into their original forms out of the paste to which they had been reduced . To what end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete with chutney , that lay in wait for us on the sideboard . " The Groteguts are perfectly matched for small-city social life , " I formulated meticulously to myself . " She favors curry while he curries favor . " " My parents are in the iron and steel business . Oh , they are ? Yes  --  my mother irons while my father steals . " That sort of thing . My eyes were growing heavy . They were ball bearings which the muscles assigned to their control could no longer support , and down they went , clown the front of Mrs. Tolliver 's dress . The promise of rest and airborne dreams after the long night of foolishness was over . ' Iie what , for God 's sake ? Harmon was looking at me with his own round eyes , the oustanding feature of his " sensitive " face . One was a plea for the humanities in a time threatened by overemphasis on technologicalskills while the other was a sustained flute note in turn resembling a single gull drifting over seas of measureless blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding my glass carefully , swiveled by degrees out of their vicinity . To find myself squarely in that of Oscar Shook . Well , poor Oscar . Oscar was a nursery owner to whose rival I had let some recent landscaping work . Some hysterical compulsionmade me bring the subject up . He writhed more wretch/edly than I. " You see , " he said , scratching his thin leg just above the knee , " I visualized a bank of evergreen trees as right for that side of your house , but passing by the other day I seen , um , I noticed someone had put in deciduous . " What could I say ? What was there to say ? " Well , " I answered , " I phoned your office at the time , but deciduous out , " and laughed hideously . I was seeking a formula , not for conversation or even for sheer human amenities , mind you , but a means by which a terribledismay with collective mankind could be reduced to an expiatory self-disgust . It would make disintegration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no call to fix in perpetual caricature . It was now nine o'clock . I now saw my plight in terms of the postman in Dickens who plied his rounds in a quarter of Londonso tortuous that he could not get to houses he was in sight of . Nickie could n't be more than fifteen feet away  --  half the original distance  --  yet he seemed as far distant as ever , due mainly to two enormously pregnant women who materialized in my path . I weighed the cogency of getting down on all fours and completing the trip in that position . It would be easier to thread one 's way through human legs than among their owner'supper bulks , certainly . Nearby stood , again , my Boss 's wife , who , glimpsed in sections , was trying to catch my eye , but I shifted mine well to the left and gesticulated at a nonexistent person , presumed to have a prior claim on my attentions , that I would be right over . This brought into my ken her husband  --  my Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in a cozy tete-a-tete with a girl he was damn well not going to let anyone butt in on , judging from the way he flicked his eye away from me . . . . Hey , what 's that just under your conscious mind , clamoring for attention ? Which novel is it of Dickens , about the part of town so tortuous mailmen ca n't get around in it ? Who can tell you ? Mme. Piquepuss ? Oh , no , let'sp51not think about her now . Back to the Boss ; that ogre will drive out any other . He was thick-figured , thick-fingered , thick-necked , thick . He wore a hand-painted necktie depicting a scene of the kind more normally seen on bass drums . It was a woodland prospect featuringa waterfall , which spilled the length of the cravat , knotted so that it would . He had taste . He nodded at something the girl was saying , his head down and his chin , or rather chins , resting in a pleated assortment on the knot of the tie , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy of its all running out of the side of his mouth . 0 my people , why are ye not home in groups of four and six , giving and taking in easy communion all that is pleasant and foolish and lovably human ? Why stand ye here in this woman 's house taking meat and drink in such wise that what cometh out of your mouth is no better than what goeth in ? . . . That girl with the Boss was lovely . If hitching down her shoulder straps I sought her breasts as in the love of globed fruit , would I be accused of an unhealthymysticism ? But the dress had been designed to flatten away not only those hillocks but all of her . All of her . Most of the women there wore the shrouds decreed by fashion . The only ones with any shape to them were the two pregnant ones . Their bellies boomed out a praise of life . I wanted to stop by and say as much , perhaps laying a hand on their sweet burdens , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every instinctnormal to the yearning to make a sacrament of life , he would soon be put away . But let 's think about this stroking an expectant mother a moment . If it were made a custom , like kissing the bride or shaking hands , might n't it have a salutary effect on our nervous systems ? A palm laid ceremoniously on their middles  --  and most ceremonies are casual  --  would purge me of fear and boredom and lust for the rest of the evening . A movement in the crowd suddenly cleared a gap betweenp52me and Nickie . I darted through it to his side . He was talking to a guy from whom I knew he would appreciate being rescued , a feature writer on the Pick who had just had a volume of his humorous sketches of city life published under the title How To Arrest a Policeman . " They told me the advance on Policemanwas seven thousand eight hundred and  --  " he was saying . I reached out to tap Nickie on the shoulder . As I did so , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own wrist . Turning , I saw my sister Lila . " I 've got to talk to you , " she said into my ear . " It 's about Nickie . I know . But this time 'll be the last . I promise . Because  --  come on , let 's go into the library . There wo n't be anybody there . " She towed me through the edge of the crowd toward a pair of tall doors at the end of the room . The library was the place for privacy , all right . No one ever went in there . Not even the Groteguts would dream of profaningthe tomblike sanctity of those beautiful sets of books . It would be safe to say of George Grotegut that he had never even heard of some of the authors on his shelves . There was no vulgarityin this attitude , because no pretension : he simply recognized the contents of the room as the treasures of human genius for which he had provided a shrine best not desecrated by his frequent appearance . Grotegut manufactured commercial candieswhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge Mix " and " TV Munch , " with a " quality " line packagedin wicker containers later usable as sewing baskets . No , the books were safe in their noble ranks till Doomsday . First editionswere in a special locked cabinet the key to which had been lost . I took down a volume of Lamartine 's essays and opened it . It gave out a report like a pistol shot . " Books like that are n't meant to be read , " said Lila , returning with fresh drinks she had gone to fetch us . " They 're bound to sit upon the shelf . "  |p53She  smiled at my little joke . She looked wan and tired , with circles under her normally bright blue eyes . Even so she was as pretty a girl as a man could want , with a figure shapely still after two children . I cursed Nickie for the trouble he caused . Not a month went by but some fresh facet of his impossibility came up for me to worry about . If only it were women ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if only he were not so likable . I steeled myself for another lament from Lila , to be followed by another pep talk from me  --  a simple airing of her feelings that would serve her till the next time . I was quite unprepared for what she told me now . " What is it this time , Sis ? " I asked , taking the glass . " What 's he done now ? " " It 's not what he 's done , this time , Chick , " she said . " It 's what I 'm going to do . " " What 's that ? " " I 'm going to divorce him . " She walked to the nearest chair , where she sat and drank from her highball as though it were a glass of water and she a child quite parched from thirst.  |p54WHEN  Lila told me she wanted to divorce Nickie , I instantlyexclaimed , " But you hardly know the boy ! " She took this to be facetious . Actually , I was trying with gentleirony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as firmly as I now would the divorce . I continued : " It 's all right for two people to rush into marriage , but divorce is a step that should be taken seriously . Splitting up a home ! What will become of the children ? " " What is becoming of them now ? If a judge decides , say , that they shall see their father week ends and three nights a month , that 's just about the status quo . When he had a job , it could be said that he supported his family . Now that he 's come into that ridiculous inheritance ' he sits at the Greek 's all day being a man of means . Maybe if a judge tells him to pony up five hundredsmackers a month alimony it 'll put some iron in his blood . " Lila had not overstated her case . The thumbnail sketch of her husband was accurate , though executed in bitterness and in a tone verging on hysteria . Life which mauls most of us into reliability ( so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriters " they " put into our hands ) had failed to deflect Nickie Sherman from his course , if you can call " drifting with every passion till your soul is a stringed lute onp55which all winds can play " a course . So now , though married and the father of two children one of whom had malocclusion , he still carried a blackthorn stick and said things like , " I hate havingmy life disrupted by routine , " and " I have only once heard Gluck made interesting , and that was by a conductor who misunderstoodhim . " This brought in no money . Nickie had once briefly worked on the local police force ( an outlet I had urged as ideal for his inductive mind ) but he had no more than settled down on the city payroll than an aunt had foolishly died and left him a small trust fund , the interest from which ( roughly ninety-five dollars a week ) he saw as bringing a cultivated insouciance once more within his reach , by conferring on him the status of Young Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job to become a free-lance sleuth . And quit it lie had ! So now we were presumably waiting for a hysterical woman not his wife to burst in on him with the news that her husband of a day had vanished , leaving no trace , and to press on him a retainer of ten thousand dollars . Meanwhile he was to be seen nightly at the Samothrace , the Greek 's , quoting Cyril Connolly to the effect that he vegetated , while other people merely lived , when fresh out of aphorisms of his own . Of his indolence he said , " I 'm developing character the hard way  --  with plenty to eat and drink and no worries . " " He 's hopeless , " said my sister as we sat in the Grotegut librarythat rotten night in June . " Not that you 're much better yourself , at times . You hardly know him . ' God . " " I 'll stand by that remark , " I said . " ' Two people should know one another inside out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what produces the frailties that produce the tensions , and what if anything can be done about them . Nickie 's tried , Lila  --  he has . He 's sworn off being a Restoration wit several times for your and the children 's sake , promised , like a drunkard takingthe pledge , to come home and talk United States , only top56go back to it each time , like a drunkard to drink . That should show you that , like drink , it springs from some inner conflict or problem that we evidently have n't gotten to yet . " " I knew him better when I first met him than I do now . " " You 're a simple girl , without a bent for those paradoxes of his , the intellectual life and all , and I rather think that may be part of the rub . He seems affectionate enough , at parties and all , holding your hand and what not . The soul of domesticity . " " Should n't that begin at home ? " " It 's because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and are bitter . But try to understand what it means to him , what makes him tick , produces the particular esprit that is Nickie . Only when it 's certain nothing can be done , that the ride will never be worth the tolls , should two people throw up the sponge and call a marriage quits . " " I 've had enough tolls , not to mention bumps and detours . No , I want out . " We sank into glum silence . Lila dug a cigarette from a pack , twirling it characteristically in her lips to wet the tip . She snapped at a pocket lighter which at first resisted ignition , then yielded a tongue of flame that lapped the length of the cigarette and half her nose : the fruit of repairs recently made to it by the glittering lad under discussion . I walked the width of the room , frowning in troubled thought . I gave my belt a hitch , and announced to her quietly : " Lila , Nickie has a touch of schizophrenia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a lot of that going around , is n't there ? " " I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do with you , Lila . I 'm going to give this thing my full attention . " She looked up in alarm . She set her glass down , now almost empty , and said : " Chick . Chick , I 'm going to tell you something straight from the shoulder . No holds barred , no punches pulled , no nothing . " She picked up her drink , but only to revolve its dregs in their ice a moment before setting it nervously down again.  | " People are talking about you . You 're the butt of a lot of  --  Now , wait . You run this column . Readers write you about their homey little problems  --  should they change jobs and how long ought a mother-in-law visit  --  and as long as it 's just that it 's fine . But when you bring them into your office and start messing around in their psyches  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case of amnesia , was n't it ? " " Into which you drove him with your therapy . " I really could not let this pass . " I drove him into it ? " I said , standing over her . " You did . By cracking that burglary case he could n't , thereby making yourself so intolerable to his ego he had to forget who you were . A fugue , we call that . Your marriage very nearly went on the rocks then , baby . I pulled it through . " " And here we are again . Which beings me to the second of the ways you 're playing with fire  --  marriage counselor . Now do n't flap your arms around like a windmill . Aere are the facts . You take this intellectual , this Ivy Leaguer , and convince him he should be a cop  --  a dick  --  " " It was my considered opinion , based on a careful analysis of his aptitudes , that criminology was a good niche for him . " " That brings us to number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I stood at the window with my back to her , drawing patiently on a cigarette . I could hear , or perhaps just sense , her turning toward me in her chair . " Chick , do you know what people call you ? " " What ? " " A triple-threat man . Because what you do n't make worse with domestic relations or vocational guidance you use psychoanalysison . Now do n't stand there snorting smoke . I hate to dop58this to you , but there 's a slogan going around about you . Betty Franz told me , not to be catty , but because she felt she owed it to us . And I owe it to you to tell you . Would you like to hear what it is ? " " Not especially . " " What they 're saying is , When you think things ca n't get any worse , see Chick Swallow . ' " I had become aware , by gazing through two windows into a room at right angles to this one , of something that had vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other room was a sort of lounge , or den , fully illuminated perhaps in expectation of spillover from the party , and in one corner stood a statue of Venus with a radio in her stomach . I smiled at this . I liked it . At that juncture of a really rather painful scene it not only drained off emotional pressure through the loving valve of humor , but , by its reminder of the plane on which after all most human judgment is pitched , offered a bridge to forgiveness as well as a call to patience . It said to me : " Little children , love one another . " Turning back into the room , I twisted out my cigarette and said gently , " It 's not just that he do n't plant taters , he do n't plant cotton . It 's a whole view of life that we 've got to knock out of him . Leave this to me . If I can only  --  " She broke in with a shake of her head , looking into her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody 's , any more . That is n't what I called you in here for . All I want is your blessing , as my brother , before I go to Reno . " I stood watching her  --  watching what was an obvious struggleagainst tears . They would be damned up now , only to flow later , when she was alone . " I withhold that blessing , Lila , " I said , quietly . In the silence , the babel of voices could be heard like a surf beating monotonouslyagainst the closed door . " Instead I shall do everything in my power to get you two straightened out . I know thatp59mostly means getting Nickie straightened around , but I mean to take that on again whether you want me to or no . But I must have this one last chance with him . It 's unlikely that I 'll run into him here tonight , and a few words at the buffet table is n't the way to handle this anyway . I 'll go beard him in his den first thing tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any lawyers or go boarding any trains to Reno till I 've had one more go at it . Will you promise ? " She shrugged , which sufficed as consent . " What can I lose ? " she said . " Just you wait and see ! " I said , and , taking her affectionately by the arm , led her out the door and back to the party.  |p60THE  Greek himself was at first all that I saw in the Samothrace . He was behind the cash register , " prostrate on a chair , " as in his current self-pitying mood he called the sitting position when involving himself , turning the pages of an Athenian newspaperwith a bored expression . His present concern was to " favor his feet , " which he had more than once described as on their last legs . He was forever going to chiropodists , meanwhile undermining what remained of them with health shoes , in which he cut gashes to relieve the pressure just as he would in any others , thus indicating to expertsthe futility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of any ministration or expedient , the mark of the true hypochondriac , and doubtless the chief satisfaction he derived from his visits to the podiatrists was that of regularly certifying their impotence . There was always some organ or area of his body in whose imperviousness to treatment he could take pride . A previous citadel which the specialists had been invited to storm had been his head , long the home of peculiar humming , or buzzing , noises ; they had not , to my knowledge , ever been formally eradicated but they were no longer mentioned , having supposedly served their psychological purpose . His systemwas like a symphony orchestra of which each instrumentp61was permitted a term of solo self-expression , according to the whim of the conductor . Now it was the feet . When I had once told the Greek that he struck me as a bit hypochondriac , he had replied , " Yeah , I would n't be surprised I got that too . " After greeting him and dropping a word of commiseration , I became aware that the restaurant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his back partly to the door , sat a figure in blue flannels reading a newspaper of his own , recognizable even from here as the London Times Literary Supplement . A cigarette burned in the fingers of one hand and a pony of somethingstood beside an empty coffee cup . At the sound of my voice Nickie dropped the Lit Sup , as he called it , and waved to me . " Well , well . Setzen Sie rich . " Drawing out a chair for myself here was no longer a natural act , though a familiar one . I had outlived the period it characterized . These were the same tables at which , suave and heathen , destinationless and suave , we had squandered the golden afternoons of youth , but I was no longer that youth . ( To the resolute Proustian , steeped in that genius 's time chemistry , I suppose they were not the same tables either . ) Nothing is so alien as the once intimate , once we arc parted from it . So that the Samothrace worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe in which to partake of food so much as a museum of my lost self , reminding me  --  but without evoking it  --  of a past in whose fantastic spirit I had once broken bread . It had not the power to haunt me  --  I haunted it . Seeing His Nibs still at home in the place did me no good either . His blackthorn was on another chair and under the table dozed his dog , a wire-haired Griffon known as Prud'homme . That Nickie saw the name as spelled that way , with the apostrophe , there was now no longer any doubt . A card from Majorcamentioning the animal had confirmed suspicions . The detailmade my teeth ache , and injected an added hazard into ap62name I already had trouble saying , fond as I was of the creature that bore it . The Griffon is a medium-sized dog of great strength and vigor , with a harsh coat like the bristles of a wild boar , into which it is pleasant to rummage down to the relatively silky undercoat . Prud'homme was steel-gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " Well so ! To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit ? " " Pause in the day 's occupation , " I answered drily , sitting down . " How did you like the party ? " " Bore . " " Why was n't everyone else bored ? " " They may have lacked the discernment . " Nickie twisted round in his chair and called the Greek . " How about a little drink for our friend ? " This was going to be worse than I 'd thought . I had appraised his habits as a return to dilettantism , but nothing in the vein of the old days quite matched the sort of thing he was doing now . Boredom was a matter of discernment ! I said I 'd have a straight Bourbon , which the Greek affected not to have heard . He was always pretending not to hear orders , especially those from remote corners of the store , preferring to hug his own corner , and resisting to the last all attempts to dislodge and set him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our part , bolstered by allusions to the Bill of Rights and threats of reprisal , we managed to establish our claim to service , and he shambled over with the whisky , with the customary show of pain and mumbling about his shoes . " The Greek has a pedal obsession , " Nickie twitted , jerking his head at him . " Pedal my foot , " the Greek said , and toiled away to his nook . I tipped back half my whisky while Nickie sipped at his brandy . " You were talking to Steve Coote at the party , " I chatted . " For my sins . "  | " Oh , now , I do n't think Steve is fair game . It 's all very well to poke fun at him , but those humorous sketches of his do bring pleasure to a good many people . He 's going to leave the world a better place to live in . " " Yes , but when ? " " We could all take a lesson from him  --  hard-working , producingfor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , and they make up 99 per cent of it . " " I suppose it takes all kinds . " This was incredible . I was like a physician who having come to treat a simple relapse encounters at the bedside an altogether new strain of the virus in question , against which previous measuresare no guarantee . By way of acquiring a more substantial " specimen " of the germ for study , as it were , I drew further samplings from quarters of the conversational bloodstream where it might be presumed most to be multiplying  --  the literary . " What 's new in the Lit Sup ? " I asked , picking up that organ and opening it . " Swell article on contemporary style , " Nickic said . " The American novel is a fat slob , and as for the mot juste , that went out with Wolfe . Why bother with one word when three will do ? " " Here 's a review of the Darrow biography , " I said , my hackles rising . " Favorable , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so appreciated abroad . " " Well , by and large , Darrow is the kind of genius that crosses borders fairly easily . Like Lincoln . The appeal is universal . " " And have you noticed something else about figures with the tragic sense ? They 're the ones who buck the race up . Not the twitterers . " Here I sensed Nickie mulling an old gambit , that of agreeing with you by saying what you 'd just said only better , which was more irritating than rebuttal.  | " Yes , " he said , moving his glass about on the tabletop , " it 's interesting to note how much of our faith is derived from skeptics . Having squarely faced an empty universe , they are best bent on cultivating our poor corner of it . Having most nakedly glimpsed eternal snow and ice , they themselves most radiate warmth and light . No , you 're right . It is not from optimists that we derive the courage to go on . " " Bunk , " I said . " This all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper and set it aside . Nickie sat appraising me over his glass as he sipped . " Why do you always get sore when I agree with you ? It 's a curious habit . " I leaned forward and smacked the table with both hands . " Where will you get the money to have Francie 's teeth straightened ? " I demanded . " Where would I get it if I were working ? " he answered , alertly . " If that 's what you 're leading up to . You need n't start another lecture . I 'm perfectly aware of the needs of my children and perfectly capable of taking care of them myself . These orthodontistsare all brigands ! Dr. Quentin quoted a price of three thousand dollars for this job . I 'd have to borrow it if I were still working , just as I would now . " " Why do you say would ' ? Are n't you going to get my niece 's mouth fixed up ? " " Oh , my God , " said Nickie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis ill suited to the role of bon vivant , spreading his arms as he expounded some ideas , like a rug merchantextolling dubious goods . " Look , I do n't hold with this current fad of running off to the orthodontist with every little thing , if that 's what you mean . They 've created malocclusion just as the psychoanalysts have created neuroses , by getting the term about . Every child in Decency has its mouth wired up likep65a bale of hay . Of course these men recommend braces . It 's their living . " " Francie has an overbite . " " So does Ingrid Bergman . So does Loretta Young . I wonder where they 'd be without them . " " It suits your purpose to wonder , " I retorted , reaching across the table to tap his chest , a measure to which I had hoped I 'd not be forced . " Bozo ! You 're just rationalizing your failure to discharge your obligations as a parent , such as correcting Francie'sbuck . " Nickie sighed and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken in a tone that was almost paternal . Now he screwed round in his chair in the manner of clubmen summoningwaiters , and by flourishing our empty glasses in an authoritativemanner very nearly succeeded in fetching the Greek . The latter grunted noncommitally , like a sleeper refusing to acknowledge he has awakened , and sat with folded arms and closed eyes . We returned to our ruckus . " I could kill that aunt of yours , " I said through my own teeth . " That will hardly be necessary , will it ? " Nickie answered with a laugh . " All the trouble that legacy has caused . Ninety bucks a week ! You had a hard enough time making ends meet when you were drawing a paycheck , but now  --  is there a merchant in town who does n't have you on his Bills Outstanding ? " " All my bills are outstanding , " said Nickic , leveling into his role again . " The trouble with you , lad , is you want the privileges of marriagewithout the obligations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a give-and-take . " " I 've never thought of it in quite that way . That 's interesting . I must try to remember it . " " Do n't you see you 're living a romance far more moonstruckp66than any shopgirl fiction ? " I said , striking the table with my fist this time . " When you pounded a beat you at least had your feet on the ground , but now ! What are you waiting for ? Pete Cheshire to get out of jail ? Your Moriarty free again to challengeyour wits ? " " There were things in his early work that I admired very much , " said my prince . " The question is whether he 'll fulfill that early promise . There 's so little creative talent coming along these days . He is due to get out soon , is n't he ? " I fell back like a collapsed puppet , unable to believe my ears . How could he have missed my satire ? No intellectual is without his blind spots , where humor fails him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to carry a kind of built-in naivete , as any cafe-society column shows . I gave the screw of travesty another turn . " Most criminals lack the imagination that excites a man 's wit , you mean , " I said , to see just how far I could go without his perceiving the mockery . " What one wants is an adversary worthy of his steel . " " Precisely . Pete has a certain low cunning . That we must give him . Whether he has the talent to go on to something really first-rate remains to be seen . " I thought of hands enclosing his throat in an act of strangulation , the thumbs joined over the larynx , the fingers well down under the collar  --  all quite undetected . We 'd had a schoolmate named Joe Bond who by bobbing his Adam 's apple up and down could agitate his necktie . He 'd come to a bad end , driving while intoxicated on the Jersey Turnpike . In a restaurant across the street I could see a fat man at a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I be sure it was Danish , I wondered , at this distance ? Because his movements had an element of surface absurdity , traceable only to some such source . My inner mind flowed on in its separate way , like an undergroundriver . It was thinking not of Joe Bond or Nickie or thep67man in the other restaurant at all , but of an article I 'd read in one of the psychiatric journals to which I subscribed . It related a fascinating case  --  or I should say a fascinating treatment  --  involving shock . Not the customary electric or drug shock , but a deliberately aimed emotional blow which had shaken the patientup in much the same sense . The subject had been a shippingclerk in late youth who displayed marked anxiety about marrying a girl to whom he had been engaged for nine years . Agitation and night sweats had followed each mention of " namingthe day . " He was put under hypnosis , and on arousal confronted with data indicating latent criminal sexual tendencies . He promptly married , frightened out of his wits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shocking " him into the assumption of a normal bond for which , previously , there had been no alternative beside which it had seemed less appalling . He acted literally on the Pauline advice that it was better to marry than to burn  --  in the electric chair ! Why should Nickums not be given a similar roughing up ? Was not some extreme possible which , by holding up his life to him for the mare's-nest it was , would administer a purging ridicule ? A man needs his liver periodically cleaned out  --  why not his ego ? The problem was to hit on some measure sufficientlydrastic to drive home the parody I could not penetrate his vanity with by verbal chaffing . Some  --  some what ? Wait a minute . I had it . Some hoax . What kind of hoax ? I puzzled over that as we continued to dispute . " You know something ? " I said . " You resent me . Oh , yes you do . And I 'll tell you why . You resent me because of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He nodded , tracing figures on the table with the base of his glass . He drew across it a design of continuous triangles of the sort that had become familiar in his pauses , and that are associated with Navajo blankets.  | " You have a point there , I 'm afraid , " he said , again in the tone that warned you that your recent remark was about to be refined into an epigram . " It 's easy enough for a man to love his enemies . The question is whether he can forgive his benefac-tors . " " Horse manure , " I said . " I 'm not going to sit here and listen to a lot of horse manure . " I plucked my derby from a chair and put it on . I did not yet rise . I finished a last trickle of whisky with it on . " If you knew what a figure you cut , sitting there . What an ass you are , in the main . I wish I could drive it home to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " " I suppose not , " he sighed quite concurringly . " But then I have no ambition in the usual sense . Perhaps I was not meant to need it . I have n't your reputation , but then I can do without that . " Something in the way he was striking a match to light a cigarette set me seething . I lashed out blindly . " Why does this dog have a cotter pin in his name ? " I shouted , rising out of the chair . " Do n't you see how ridiculous it all is ? 0 God in Heaven , it 's all too silly for words . Prud'homme ! " The dog , hearing his name barked in what he took to be angrysummons , leaped from his sleep and wagged his tail at me in confusion . I reached down and soothed him with a few discreetwords . Nickie had waved the match out , holding a mouthful of smoke uninhaled as he watched me . I felt myself perspiring , and my smile came tautly as I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nickie ? I 've often wondered . Is that who he 's named after ? " " No , no . The painter is Prud'hon . You 're thinking of Pierre Prud'hon . " " Of course . How stupid of me . " I tried to summon the love necessary to go on with this , but it would n't come . Hearing his name further bandied  --  or thinking he had  --  Prud'homme looked from one to the otherp69of us with bright expectation , panting . He had that expression of doting regard we like to call " human , " though whether it is anything more than an echo of something canine in our own natures is a question . " It is n't that I do n't have faith in you , " I said to Nickie . " I do . That 's why I holler at you sometimes . I think you 're worth saving . " He nodded , breathing smoke as he consulted a wall clock . " Because you can amount to something . You have the stuff ... " I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so . Because the idea for the hoax had struck me all of a heap . It had sprung into my mind full-fledged , as the plot for Uncle Tom 's Cabin is said to have sprung into Harriet Beecher Stowe 's while she was sitting in church . This was my " plot , " as indeed I might call it : Saturday night would find us both at another party , the Flickendens ' . Along toward the middle of the evening , there would be a phone call for Nickie . At the other end of the wire would be an overwrought woman 's voice reporting that her husband had been murdered , and would Nickic Sherman please come as soon as possible . Nickie would high-tail it over to the address given , that of a former bit actress named Susan Markey whom I knew but Nickie did n't , and whose husband was an inveterate prankster . He , the husband , would be lying face down on the bedroom floor , clad only in pajamas , a lamp cord twisted round his neck and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to work gathering clues ( in anticipation of the thick-fingered police ) , in the midst of which the corpse would rise and dust himself off . Everyone would get a good laugh , including the party guests , who would have piled into their cars and followed in the excitement . Nickie would put a good face on it , enjoying the fun at his own expense , but once home would take the lesson to heart . IIe would have been made to see himself as others saw him  --  at last ! The japep70would rock him to his roots at first , but then , his ego cauterized , stripped of his folly , he would come down to earth and maybe start a new life on terms with reality . Whether he would learn I was behind it was unimportant ; if he did , he would live to thank me for it . That was the plan . " I must be off , " I said , eager to get back to the office and look up the article again . " See you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins . " I hurried from the reception room to my private office with my secretary at my heels , reading messages aloud as we flew . " Mrs. Cherne called again to say that her husband now sleeps with a chest protector on . There 's a letter from the Women 's Club thanking you for your splendid talk on " The Problem of the Only Child . " They want to know if you 'll address them next month on " The Problem of the Only Parent . " Like when the father and mother are divorced and the children live with one or the other , " Miss McConkey reported as we trotted on through , the swinging door flapping in our wake . " Here , I 'll take your hat , Dr. Swallow . A Mr. Appleyard phoned . He said you 'd know what it was about and for you to please call him back without fail . Oh , and Dr. Swallow . " Her habit of addressing me that way was a persistent one which I had decided simply to ignore since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ego . The reverse of Nickie , she needed buildingup , and nothing built her up so much as bustling importantlyabout calling me " Doctor . " Now her voice dropped a tone to register the sense of portent which accompanied all her references to the Boss . " Mr. Bulwinkle has been trying to reach you all afternoon . He wonders where you go . He wonders what you do . Shall I get him now and let him know you 're in ? "  | " Put him on , " I ordered slavishly , " this very minute ! " " Right , Doctor . " She went out with her gelatinous walk , her flesh setting up within mine a useless contrapuntal greed , leaving in my mind a familiar mixture of tenderness and filth . If without preamble I raised her skirts and likened her limbs to marble seen by moonlight , would I be accused of Neoclassicism ? It was painful to recall that the one time I had taken her to lunch , at a neighborhoodrestaurant , she had looked at the menu and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . I love that . " I sighed heavily and turned to the mountain of human documentsawaiting reply on my desk . It seemed to me that the problems lost quality with each new paper added to the syndicatewe fed , which now numbered eleven dailies in almost as many states . The first letter was from a woman who wrote : I 've been married seventeen years and never had an organism . What are those ? I read in articles and my friends tell me I am missing something , but do n't know how to go about changing my ways . My husband refuses to discuss it with me .. . I threw the letter in the wastebasket ( all that could be done with queries bearing no return address and not suitable for publishedreply ) and picked up another . It was a complaint from a woman who had originally written in asking how to get rid of moles . Since we 'd had no garden editor , I simply had Miss McConkeyphone a drugstore for the name of a reliable mole poison and recommended it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , I believe , Mole-Slay , which are put down into mole runs . The woman had purchased a package and swallowed one or two with a glass of water , necessitating her being rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped out . Which was the first inkling I 'd had that she had meant not lawnp72pests but face blemishes , and that her letter should have been referred to our Beauty Hints expert . Now she was sending notes threatening legal action , which it was a simple matter to keep from the higher-ups by putting them into the wastebasket also . I rose and went to a refectory table on which were kept all my magazines , laid out by Miss McConkey in neat rows like those in clubs frequented by men of parts . I easily found the issue of the Psychiatric Quarterly I wanted , and sat down in an armchair to reread the article which so excited me . It had originally been a paper read at a psychiatric conventionin Lisbon , by a Dutch practitioner named Van Kuykens , and ran : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man down to earth is to blow him sky-high . Blasting is often preliminary to construction . Of course such a measure is precisely the matter of delicacy that it does not sound , and should be undertaken in only the most skilled hands , by someone with the fullest possible knowledge of what he is doing . I raised my eyes to pause in reflection . I guessed I knew Nickie all right enough , inside and out , to gauge the degree of embarrassment that might prove stunning . I read on : For what we are talking about here is a kind of fission , if you will , a momentary furious splitting of the atom of Pride ( of which let us remember that the notorious Ego is only the nucleus ) . Or to use a cruder metaphor , it is like one of these calculated kicks we deal a piece of broken machinery , which will make it work again if it does not destroy it utterly . . . . My phone was being buzzed and I rose to answer it . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McConkey said , " without delay . "  |p73I  galloped derisively into Bulwinkle 's office and came to a running stop on an island of coagulated stockings known as a hooked rug six feet from his desk . There I stood at a caricatureof attention for some seconds . " Yes , sir ? " I said in a timorous squeal which took courage , lifting our relationship as it did into the realm of pure satire . Bulwinkle shifted from ham to ham , like Sweeney in his bath . He sat in shirtsleeves because he was the Boss , while I had on a coat , being a shirtsleeve philosopher with some standing in the community . His tie hung on a rack as well as his coat ; it depicted a girl manipulating a canoe in bright sunlight . He clenched in his teeth an expired cigar , which helped him strike the note of ferocity which he tended to confuse with high standards . Bulwinkle had only recently taken over the Picayune Blade , which he edited as well as published . IIc modeled himself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city-desk man , snapping , " Why ca n't I get decent reporters ? " and " Call that a story ? " in persecuted soliloquy . IIc fomented bedlam in both office and pressroom and tried to convey the impression , though there was always plenty of time to get the paper out , that we were operating under intolerable pressure . He cultivated chaos on his desk , among whose effects were the black coffee , aspirin and stale pie associated with the ruthless metropolitan dailies . On his assumption of ownership , he had summoned the entire staff to a lecture in which he told them bluntly that newspaper work was a brutal profession and that he could promise them nothing but long marches and hard bivouacs , which came as a surprise to numerous veteran employees accustomed to the leisurely , even apathetic , tempo under his predecessor , but who , however , obligingly broke into a trot when Bulwinkle came into view , pecked out copy with their hats on , had sandwiches and coffee sent in , and spoke of " gettingthe rag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , relighting the cigar butt , " goddamnit , with Melton leaving we wo n't have anybody to handle Today 's Chuckle . I was wondering if you 'd care to take it on . It 's open . " " I think not , " I said . " Thanks though . " " You 'd do a bang-up job . " I resented that . To be judged capable of turning out : " Waiter , do you serve crabs ? " " Yes , what 'll you have ? "  --  to be regarded as just the man to beg , borrow , steal or fabricate a wheeze like that every day  --  filled me with rage . By way of panningfor a gleam of self-respect in all this muck I said , " It 's not for me . Besides , my column takes all my time . " " It pays fifty bucks a week extra . We 're going to run it boxed , on the lower front page , from now on . Just a two-line joke a day . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through many such a scene as this , did he but know , and saw me through now . I smiled and said , " Thanks just the same . " " Okie doke . " He shrugged and looked down at his desk . I sensed that he had something more on his mind  --  that the problem of succession to Today 's Chuckle was the least of it . " Swallow , " he said , rising , " you have a hell of a lot of peoplecome to your office . I see them in the waiting room when I go by . Just a minute . I know it 's always been policy for the Lamplighter to be available to people in need as well as to answer their letters . But I 've been told that you get some of them in there and psychoanalyze them . Is that true ? " " I would n't call it that , " I said . " If you mean do I handle their problems in a psychological light , of course  --  that 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . " " But do you represent yourself as a psychiatrist ? " " Certainly not . " He fiddled worriedly with a file of papers on his desk , behind which he remained standing . I noticed that he had only onep75sleeve rolled up , as though in the frenzies of journalism there had been no time to do the other . " Your secretary calls you Doctor . ' " " It 's a little notion she 's picked up . I 'll speak to her about it . " " See that you do . You 're a newspaperman  --  not a head-shrinker . " I thought that ended the matter . Bulwinkle appeared to wish it might , too . But he hesitated again , then asked with visible reluctance : " I understand there was some hullabaloo a few years ago , before my time , about you practising psychiatry on a girl . Lawsuit , was n't it ? " I laughed , though my disrelish at the phrase " on a girl " was keen . " Oh , sir , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start , and I knew it . You see , I deliberately walked into the trap in order to get a case for my brother-in-law , a kind of amateur sleuth . I thought he needed building up then , but I know better now . " " The story is that this brother-in-law went into amnesia as a result of your treatment . " " That 's a lie ! It was a result of his wife 's solving a case that had him stumped , involving a small-time grifter name Pete Cheshire , known as the Smoothie  --  " " Another ward of yours , was n't he ? " said Bulwinkle , reading what appeared to be a full dossier . " He was paroled to me , yes . My position in the community gives me lots of these extra responsibilities . We all went pretty much through hell on it , but I think we 've won through . We 're in the clear now . " " Is your brother-in-law all better ? " " Oh , absolutely . He does n't even remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . We do n't want the paper sued , you know . "  |p76A|p|pleyard  said : " Let 's go sit in the garden . Though it 's probablycooler here in the house . Stone foundation helps that much . The muggy days are here again . " I was glad to leave a house which I found oppressive not for reasons of humidity but because of what is called in journalism an unfavorable climate of opinion . IIe led the way out the back and into a dooryard long remembered . The arbor sagged under wistaria denser than that which choked the front porch ; the vines now supported in their clutch the crumbling latticework , rather than the other way around . I have always thought wistaria a disagreeable bloom . It lay in obscene bloated clusters at our feet as we made for a glider , scarcely less decayed than the arbor , at the edge of the orchard . Sweet trees of my childhood , standing suddenly in your flower like lathered shaving brushes ; cool stream that rippled through the hot afternoons , beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed of odd lumber and the sides of commercial packing cartons , was deep in the obscuring boughs , but I made out a patch of faded letters reading KELLOGG 'S CORN FLA , and a face peering from that green lair : the Nereid was watching . In the astigmatic dusk , I had a sense of mythology encroaching on us , enveloping events . As if reality were still in control but only by a narrow margin , like the 51 per cent by which conservative businessmen struggle to retain possessionof corporations threatened by unstable elements buying up securities on the sly . I had , indeed , the picture of sprites and goblins abroad , now that the sun had set and the moon risen , purchasing shares at a rate that might turn the tables against us if we did not watch out . How long would we be able to keep even our fragile hold on sanity ? " Now then , have you given any more thought to Sweetie ? " Applcyard asked , unctuously enough , as he sat down on the glider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt of red and white plaid , open at the throat ; justp77what an astute stage director would have chosen for a weak character given to buck passing . " May I answer that by asking another question ? " I remained standing , holding to one of the metal uprights of the glider as I crossed one foot over the other and looked down at him . He was wiping his brow with a clean white handkerchief . " Would you say she 's had a parental guidance that took account of her needs ? Particularly , a strong father image in her formative years ? Can you honestly say she 's had that , Appleyard ? " " Shh ! " Appleyard said . He pointed a thumb in the direction of the tree , from where we might be overheard . " Yes , " he whispered , " I think I can say that , in all conscience . I was alwaysgood to her , and stern when the situation called for that . " " Who is the real authority in this house ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one like a withered gourd . " What do you mean by that ? " " What steps have you taken to mature that girl ? " " For one thing , we 've had a telephone installed in the tree-house . " " An extension ? " " Certainly not ! Her own private phone , where she can be reached . We thought it might encourage her to keep in touch . " He sighed and looked toward the house . " Let 's go inside for a breath of air . It 's awful out here . And these damned gnats . " He smote himself in the face . " Just what did you expect me to do ? " Appleyard was uncertain ; at least he hesitated . The light was draining away , and I could see the horn of the moon over the woodlot . After a moment he said : " I was thinking if you were to begin all over again . . . I mean , take it from the scene in the coalbin where it all went wrong , somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do it finely , so to speak , and thus lead her out into normal daylight , like other girls . . . I think you know what I mean . You frightened her  --   |p78all  right , It frightened her  --  into this Lady of Shalott character she 's become . Who better than you to coax her out of her ivory tower , off that island , down to Camelot ? Show her sex is beautifulrather than beastly . " There seemed now no mistaking his meaning . " You mean make love to her ? " Appleyard had been a bit ruffled in stating his plan , but his composure returned now that the words were out and had not frozen us to stone . " She 's a good ' girl for bad reasons , where the reverse might have some virtue to it . My daughter is ruined far worse than if she had been ruined ! I make no bones about saying that only by proper  --  by someone not bungling , but rather  --  Where are you going ? " " Home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I strode toward the porch . " You 're in it up to your neck whether you like it or no . " Appleyard 's voice was so low as to be barely audible , yet it arrested me with one foot on the bottom step . I turned back to hear him out in this position . My coat was over my arm . " You take a conventional point of view just where it serves no purpose . Do you call that "  --  he jerked a thumb over his shoulder toward the darkening tree again  --  " purity ? Is that what you want to perpetuate ? A virgin locked in amber ? Do you think a moral quibble quite the manly thing ? I do n't . Not when you 're probably the only man alive who can unscramble the mess we 've got on our hands . " " You keep forgetting one thing . I 'm not to blame for it . I thought I made that quite clear . " " All right , you 're not . The accusations are withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help us ? Or will you skedaddle like the frightened rabbit that I think you are ? Or are you a coward clean through ? " I sighed irresolutely . " The situation is fraught with danger , "  |p79I  said . " You speak of the Lady of Shalott , and a neat comparisonit is . But do you remember what happened to her , when she finally did go down to Camelot ? It killed her . She had been too long in the world of Illusion . " " I 'll take that risk . Things could n't be any worse than they are now . That 's why I 'm calling on you . " Here was an unpleasant echo of what my sister had told me they were saying about old Chick Swallow , around town  --  and a moment 's inkling of how they might have it all hurled back in their teeth . The most delicate piece of surgery one had yet been called upon to perform .. . Appleyard crossed the grass to my side . IIc looked down , walking with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoes in a store . " I 've given this considerable , and very earnest , thought , and I believe it makes sense . Take up where you left off , and get it right . I 'm a father asking you to seduce his daughter . Is that such an unreasonable request ? It happens every clay , " he went on , backing me up the stairs and against the porch wall while in the wood the centaurs and the fauns were buying up stock like mad by the light of the moon . A faint wind stirred the leaves among which , over the chuckling river , I ) apinne hung betweenheaven and earth . Things were in a kind of unbearable balance , half real , half mythological , with myself planted with a foot in either kingdom . I stood woodenly , as if turned to a tree . " In baseball parlance , you once muffed a fly , " Appleyard murmured gently . " Now I 'm asking you to chase the ball . " " And if I refuse ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " In that case , " he answered with what I will call extreme unction , " I shall have to turn you over to Mme. Piquepuss . " Mme. Piquepuss sat in the cool gloom of the parlor drinking beer from a cup . I thought it was coffee she was sipping till Ip80saw her go into the kitchen , later , and refill the cup from a large bottle of Budweiser . Her stick was propped against her chair , a high wingback embroidered with peacocks . She looked up when I entered , nudged forward encouragingly by Appleyardlike a child pushed onstage , and said , " Can I give you something to drink ? " " No , thank you , " I said , resisting all obligations here , even of ceremony . Appleyard gave a last glance over his shoulder into the room as he fled up the stairs , his footsteps swift and decisive as befit a man taking a firm line . Dressed again in dark hues , Mme. Piquepuss was but meagerlyperceptible in the half-light , except for her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light from a street lamp , just turned on . I sat in a draw-up chair opposite her from where , without seeing her head , I could make out the white antimacassarit partially obliterated . The cup floated upward , lurked a moment out of sight , and returned to the saucer . I reached out and drew the tasseled cord of a floor lamp . " Do you mind ? " I said as Mme. Piquepuss sprang , blinking , into view . She set the cup and saucer on a table which also had one of those white tidies on it  --  they were everywhere . On the table I noticed something else . It was a sheaf of frayed foolscap , rolled up and secured with a fat rubber band . She touched the corners of her mouth with a square of cambric and said , " People do n't like to sit in the dark any more . Is it because they 're afraid of their own thoughts ? " " Twilight is more appreciated in rural communities than urban , and more in foreign lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people eager to snap the switches and get on with the evening , " I said . " And I 'm not at all well . I had a restless night . " " Not sleeping any too well ? " Her voice was low and  --  " throaty " is not the word that comes to me so much as " furry . " It reminded me of soft cater/pillars and things proceeding cautiously in deep shade ; it was something traveling up my spine as much as heard in my ear . The ghost of an accent came and went , subtly changeable , like the nap on her velvet dress , worn in defiance of the heat , or in observance of propriety to callers . She had emigrated from the Touraine in the 188os . I noted again the twitching play of Mme. Piquepuss 's lips , like the flickering origins of smiles that came to naught . As she spoke she tapped her right foot gently on the rug , as though somewhere she heard a melody being faintly fiddled ; or as though  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare people who obtain radio broadcasts on their dental fillings  --  though this may have been the result of a jumble of musical impressions Mine . Piquepuss herself conveyed , and that may be analyzed in this wise : The color of her velvet dress was a deep purplish blue , like that with which the carrying cases of musical instruments are lined . Perhapsit was this association that made her thin arms , for the moment angularly at rest in her lap , remind me of a disjointed clarinet , and all of these thoughts together foster the illusion that she was humming under her breath . " No , I could n't sleep , " I said , and added with a smile , " exceptwhen it was time for the alarm to go off . For just as Proust was awakened by the thought that it was time to go to sleep , so most of the rest of us are , I judge , rather lulled into slumber by the realization that it is time to get up . IIe was a special case . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most anxious to get on with this matter , " Mme. Piquepuss returned . " I almost thrashed her to make her talk about the Experience , but she would not . The alternative is to make you do so . " She reached out to steady the stick , which was slipping along the flank of her chair . " It is naturally very difficult for her to speak of what occurred Down There , but she did tell me one thing . " " Go on . "  | " Please do not interrupt . There was evidently some sort of commotion , or scuffle , she said , during which you reached over and tried to touch something . " There was a rain of blows on my legs . Pummeling my knees , I leaned out of my chair and said , " Now this has gone far enough ! I will not have any more of this absolutely ridiculous kind of talk . I say that too many people are paying too much attention to the fantasies of a hysterical girl  --  yes !  --  suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuses othersof had happened . What we call in psychology projection . So there you have it ! " " It 's what she said happened . " " What does she say I was trying to touch ? May I ask that we be specific ? Shall we lay it on the line , please ? " Mme. Piquepuss gave an uneasy shrug , and glanced speculativelytoward the back door . " Oh , do n't call her in , for heaven 's sake . She does n't even know what she 's got there , for a man to go after , " I said . " But if you could give me a rough idea where it was located , and perhaps a word as to its function , I 'd appreciate it . " Mme. Piquepuss'shead lay back on the tidy , on which it rolled from side to side , the eyes closed , while she raised a hand in a plea to desist . " What was your understanding about that ? Is  --  well , let me put it this way . Are there one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I have a right to ask that . Are there one or two ? " " One or two of what ? " she brought out weakly . " Of what I was trying to touch . For on whether singular or plural depends the gravity of the charge . If we are asked to considersomeone reaching down a dress , with the query Are they beginning to sprout yet , girlie ? Let 's see . Are they , eh ? ' uttered in all good humor , that 's one thing . If reaching up from underneath  --  " Mme. Piquepuss was leaning over the side of the chair , in anp83ominous suggestion of someone two days at sea . The strain was too great for her . She could not finish what she had begun . I relented , and went on more charitably : " My own guess is that the first , or milder , alternative was meant . I say this for reasons that may at first appear occult , but are based on what can be demonstrated as a mysterious sensory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear Mme. Piquepuss , is a recurring nightmare that I can not divest myself of the hunch is related to the Experience in some subterranean way , though my conscious memory yields no account of what you say . Related to it because the feature of this nightmare is a double image  --  the idea of two . In my sleep , I keep dreaming that I am on a motorcycle , speeding down a dark road toward a pair of approaching headlights , between which it is my intention to steer my flying course , supposing them to be two other motorcycles , one at either side of the road . IIowever , at each meeting the pair of headlights prove to be not two motorcycles but one truck , hurtling me awake among the disheveledbedclothes . The dream is repeated , like that of the woman I believe M. Verdurin kept seeing iii Swami 's Way , the evil woman whose hand , holding a cloth , would reappear before his face each time he dozed off and wipe him awake . " " No , I think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite herself again and sitting erect . " Yes , it was Bergotte , in The Captive . " " You read Proust ? " I said . " Why , what a pleasant surprise ! I 've been dipping into him again of late . Well , well ! So we have something in common . A strong bond , would n't you say ? " Mme. Piquepuss was looking toward the bay window in which I sat . There were several wasps in the room , some of which had settled on the curtain there . She rose , glancing up at the ceiling as for some opening in the wall through which they might have made their entry . Picking up an enormous pair of shears from a table , she stole over to the curtain without dis/turbing the insects . Deftly , she slipped one of the blades under a wasp and cut it in two . She did this with a couple of others before the remaining few took wing and dispersed . " I ca n't stand to swat things any more , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose we mellow as we get older . " I stared at the halved wasps . " They have spray bombs for these things now , " I said . " Sluga-Bugis a good one . They 've perfected them so they 're nontoxicto people , and can be used anywhere . " " This is nontoxic , " she said , clacking the shears a time or two before laying them by . She settled herself again among the flamingpeacocks . " Now then , where were we ? " " Sweetie , and these fibs of hers . ' Mythomania ' is the term we have for the compulsion to tell stories . We 'll get her through this , never fear ! But now , Mme. Piquepuss , " I said , " here 's a curious thing that must have struck you too . How can anyone , so shy of the outside world , in her one sortie into it pull a stunt so brazen ? I mean of course that oratorical contest she went into with a speech stolen bodily from Daniel Webster . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cup to the kitchen , where I saw her reach into the icebox and refill it from the halfgallonBudweiser . I hurled myself woozily into some more Proust . " How can a shrinking violet do anything so unlike her  --  so publicly ? That is what we say . Till we remember that the trait most likely to accompany an extreme is its opposite . For just as artists are found to be serving on town schoolboards while businessmen collect rare editions ; just as we find the local clergyman conducting a liaison with a barmaid and the prostitutea devout observer of religious forms ; just as the skinflint  --  following the principle of contrariety which decrees that to every action there be an equal and opposite reaction  --  dispenseslavish tips to waiters , and the son long remarked as ' Mama 's Boy ' is discovered , one morning , to have dismemberedp85his mother with an ax  --  so it is precisely the nervous girl  --  shy , ethereal , cloistered  --  who must at least once in her life blaze a trail across the national skies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my own eyes closed , not in agony but the better to spin a sample of that erectile grammar which I had once observed to be the proxy pleasure of a man doomed : to invirility  --  this in high-school clays when I had used to read : of Combray in bed long after my light was ordered out , so that mingled with the narrator 's fears that his Mama would not come to his bedroom to say good night were mine that my Papa would show up in mine ( a visit ill-mitigated by my humorously remarking , as I did one night , of the writer in which he found me immersed , that , once arrested by this author , we may expect long sentences )  --  but of which in this brief oral espousal I had . suddenly another intimation vouchsafed me , a flash of insight so inebriating that I regretted not being able to share it with Mme. Piquepuss ( under pain of prejudicing my status with her ) , namely that this labyrinthine syntax called for feats of respirationto which an asthmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal breathing is even remotely geared  --  having been thus disposed in my chair , I had not seen : Mme. Piquepuss return to the parlor . She had walked so softly . When I opened one eye it was to find her standing over me , the roll of foolscap in her hand . She was tapping it suggestively in her palm , like a truncheon . " What do you mean ? " I asked , sitting bolt upright and uncrossingmy legs . At the same time I instinctively put out both hands in a reflex of self-defense  --  in time to catch the roll as it dropped into my lap . " Read these , " she said . I removed the rubber band , unfurled the manuscript and . began to read  --  for the surprise of my life.  |p86THE  first of Sweetie 's poems that I read was executed in telegraphicquatrains reminiscent of Emily Dickinson , in form if not altogether in spirit : The cock that splits my slumber Is a very raffish birdWho has had my numberEver since he heardThat I would rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jilted out of night . The lord of light is brazen ; I see his lance come nigh When at last I openThe aspic of my eye . The next page of manuscript suggested that I was probably not reading the poems in the order in which they 'd been written , in the order , that is , of Sweetie 's spiritual and aesthetic developmentover the years the material spanned . It was a seriesp87of couplets done in the offhand mixture of rhyme and nearrhymeof the early Auden : No need to cry " Touche ! " When scalped of your toupee . All that 's false must go . Breast the future so : Comrades marching bald Of all illusion , galledBy nothing but a fattishSentimental fetish . Beware the well-groomed prexyWhose daughter wants your proxy ; Do n't pay for those coiffuresSeen in rotogravures . Beware the smiling briber . Develop lots of fiber . Plan on growing thinner Of a reasonable dinner , And leave the past to pukeInto its own peruke . It was odd to think of Sweetie embracing proletarian thought and sounding calls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested " They "  --  now simply transposed into an economic key  --  and that she probably did n't realize what she was saying anyway . A more interesting question to me was how long it had taken her to play it down , to " throw it away " as they were saying in the theater at the same time that the antipoetic was proceeding on other fronts . Many influences must have been at work before the Oxford Group had their way with Sweetie , not least of which would be the conversationaltone of more obvious origin as displayed in a poem entitled " Stopping at a Country Auction on a Summer After-noon : "  |p88Whose  goods these are I think I know . His house is in the churchyard though ; IIe will not see me stopping here To see how well his goods will go . " Brother ! " I thought , very possibly aloud . This went beyond the question of influences . Sweetie was at it again  --  shoplifting . She had plagiarized from every poet who amounted to a damn since Whitman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the specific metaphor ) without bothering to file the serial numbers off the motors . The result was almost a parody history of modern verse . Knowing I was a fool , I kept an ear cocked for a note I had not heard before , that would announce our Sweetie had at last found her own style . I died hard , on the theory , I guess , that what obtains in legal burglaries must be true of the artistic , namely their requiring enough skill to suggest what the criminal might do if he went straight . While it was one thing to turn out yet another hieroglyphic of Cummings , complete with no capitalsand looking as though it had been punctuated with a peppershaker , and maybe not much better to note the swing to religion among intellectuals in a paraphrase of T. S. Eliot end-ing : This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a wimple .. While these were , I say , one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All Isles Are Blessed While the Voyage Lasts " that would not entirely have disgraced its model , Elinor Wylie : All isles are blessed while The Voyage lasts ,  |p89All  harbors handsome From the masts . Living with you 's lovely , But I 'd soonerGo to seek you In my schooner . I took hope from my not being altogether sure whether it was Wylie or Millay bleeding through here ; it had the strain of girlishirony running in both . And it required a bit of something or other to produce a mimicry of Wallace Stevens that I recognized as such even from the title  --  " The Courtesan Takes Cortisone "  --  some of whose further word-plays ran : Perhaps Her papsAre not what was expected . In short , Sweetie not only talked about poetry  --  she did something about it . What was I going to do about that ? After reading about half of this goulash I asked Mine . Piquepuss ( who had been going quietly about the room dividing hornets ) whether I might take the manuscript home with me for more leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding it longer than overnight , for she had stolen it from a drawer of Sweetie 's desk without the latter 's knowing it . So it was that midnight found me in my own easy chair , reading avidly . The foolscap was intermingled with sheets of ruled and punched notebook paper , many of them old and scuffed . The writing was in both pencil and typewriter . For a long time it was more of the same . Jeffers , de la Mare , Yeats and even Rossetti passed in chronologically untidy review . I was grateful for all my past immersion in the originals , which stood me in good stead in spotting the thieveries.  |p90As  I approached the end of the manuscript , I came to a page that straightened me in my chair . Here was a beat that was new to me , and one that I found instantly exhilarating . Lush sensuousimagery and sheer reveling in words created an effect that broke over me like a wave : While still erect as gravestones let us singHow in the Sabbeth-gentled west the roseBlooms from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained , whose salt blood ticks in my wristHere on the hill where bleeds the pubic spring , And the bridegroom came . I make this in a summer 's dalliance , when all the lion-Joined And loaned and lying loves have left , and a clenching wind Turns me to the ribbed shore beyond . In the fieldBehind me waves tomorrow 's bread . In ocean bedsThe seamen in their beards are tweaked by every tide . Then the red reptile in my vine of veinsQuickens to music from the fluting bones of birds . So clutching that prophet pickled long in brineI let his grandson pluck me from the Scriptures south Straight to that shuttered room in MozambiqueWhere a twist of the dial will shut the ectoplasm off , Killing the suitor with the smoking gun , the debutante in splints , The cross-eyed cop , and all the the 's we got from Auden and his boys . So all my mother tolled me is the clapper in the belle . And all I know is what he rages in the dusk , the songWhirled out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat : The last harvest is a shower of seed  |p91I  rose , scarcely able to breathe . Could it be true ? Had Beth Appleyard , the girl who had for so long gnawed her braids at an upper window , at last broken through her period of apprenticeshipinto a style authentically her own ? Not only that , but one that would burst upon our generation with all the rioting imagery , wild-soaring music and plain juice-squirting joy in words needed to free poetry itself from its long calcification ? And was I destined to be her discoverer ? Sweetie ? No , it was too fantastic . And yet , why not ? Stranger human organisms than she had produced the world 's art . And how much infantilism was there not demonstrably at the heart of all talent ? " You were silly like us " Auden had written of Yeats himself . Trembling , I read the poem again , and two more in the same vein . There was no doubt about it . here was an idiom I had not encountered before . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wink that night . Still quivering with excitement , I hurriedover to show my prize to the one man in Decency capable of appreciating it . Nickie was sitting outside the Samothrace . He had his head tilted back to put nosedrops into it for sonic allergy he suffered this time of year , while in the other hand he held a copy of the Kenyon Review which he continued to read in the position requiredfor this medication . It was a way of showing himself " dedicated , " to all the lumpish and witless herd scurrying past his table . In our high school days , we had persuaded the Greek to let us drag a few tables out onto the sidewalk , there to sip our coffee in the evening air as true expatriates . The custom had persisted through every summer since , with only a little worried reluctance on the part of the Greek who thought we were talking about being " expatriots , " and whose , own wish to be a loyal American , albeit a dirty and sardonic one , was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Existentialp92bandied about , but he seemed to think it was the name of an insurance company . The only other sidewalk customer at the moment was a man named Pete Shotz who must have been as old as Mmc . Piquepuss but in whom , by contrast , the vital saps no longer ran . He had lost all his illusions in 1919 when ShoelessJoc Jackson and his cohorts had thrown the World Series , thereby betraying both the Chicago White Sox and the sport of baseball as such . He rolled his own cigarettes from a sack of Bull Durham , spilling flakes into his beer , which no doubt gained in zest thereby . " Setzen Sie sich , " Nickie said . " Never mind that , " I said , drawing out a chair so as not to disturb Prud'homme , who was snoozing under another . We lit up cigarettes , and then , in a pause , I drew from my bosom the three or four sheets of manuscript which comprised the samples of my discovery . " What do you think of these ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some poems a local writer gave me to look at . " Nickie smoothed them down and read , with no want of absorptionI was glad to see . Once , turning a page , he raised his eyebrows in appreciation at some twist of phrase . When he had finished he handed them back to me , nodding . " Not bad , " he said . " Not bad . Is that all you can say ? " " They 're amazingly skillful pastiches , sure . Some of the echoesare uncanny . All that sea stuff , and the Sabbath-gentled west , catch him to a T. It 's a favorite trick of Thomas 's , making verbs out of adjectives and nouns . And that sort of sprung rhythm , which he got from Hopkins , of course . " Gritting my teeth , I turned in my chair to flag the Greek through the door . But the effort to get him out here was wellnighhopeless , and I abandoned it . Nickie was nursing a beer which he had undoubtedly fetched himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were a per/sonal friend of yours . " Apparently this new voice had already burst on the literary scene while I was tied up with other things than avant-garde publications . " Dylan Thomas . " " That 's better . Of course Dylan Thomas . Do you think I do n't realize that ? Of course every writer is derivative at first . I. did n't come here to ask you that . What I 'm trying to decide is whether behind the echoes there 's enough individuality to warrantencouraging her , for Christ 's sweet sake . " " Her , ' eh ? Who is she ? Anybody I know ? " Now there was a funny thing . For days that had been the . very thing I 'd been meaning to ask him  --  whether he knew Sweetie . Another one of Nickie 's high-school-day mots had popped into my mind , about a certain girl having " lovely lips but a cruel mouth , " and I wondered if lie had said it about her .. I now told him her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " No , it does n't ring any bell . Who is she ? . What does she want ? " " Oh , a half-daft girl with vine leaves in her hair , who hears , the horns of elfland faintly blowing . She 's going to kill us all yet . She 's the one there was that oratorical contest scandal about . " " Oh , yes . I remember that , vaguely . " " Well , at least she reads . She keeps up . " Dylan Thomas , eh ? I must look into him . Evidently the newthingsince Auden and Co. all right . It might be pointed out in my defense that though Dylan Thomas had appeared here in print and had even cut that legendary swathe through Midtown . Manhattan and down the Eastern girl's-school circuit that was to establish him as the mgst Byronic figure since Byron , he was still the pleasure of the few . This was the last poet whose pocketsSweetie Appleyard was to pick , and in whose arms she was destined to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew then , was that I could n't sit here and discuss the Apocalyptic Move/ment with Nickie ; I was too busy , with too many people to get organized , including himself . I would see him soon enough at the Flickendens ' brawl . That was where he would get his . " I suppose it 'll be ghastly , " I said . " Fancy dress , have you heard that ? God . Why do we keep going to things over and over that drive us crazy , when all we need to get out of them is the guts to say the simple word No ' ? " Nickie agreed with me . Nodding , he sipped his beer with narrowedeyes , perfecting my observation . " Yes , " he said at last , " it is to cowardice , rather than to courage , that we pay our tolls of stamina . " " Horse pizzle , " I said . " I ca n't sit here exchanging horse-pizzlynuances about life . I have work to do . See you Saturday then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , rising . " I have n't decided on a costume yet . " " I may go as an ass , " he said , " because that 's certainly how I 'll feel . " If you only knew the half of it , baby ! I thought as I bade him good-by and hurried back to the office.  |p95WENT  as a house painter myself . I had spent the afternoon calcimining upstairs bedrooms and been struck with the inspiration of going as the early Schicklgruber , which combined with a ready-made costume the virtue of not having to dress for dinner . It went down poorly with Crystal , who had spent hours , if I should n't say weeks , assemblingherself as the Mother of the Gracchi , on the assumption that I would go as Tiberius Sempronius , her husband . My lastminuteresource , or rather the unpreparedness it was designed to meet , provoked a bitter quarrel . We had been in touchy spirits since four o'clock when Crystal had chided me for not having " done anything " about Nickie , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the secret of the threateneddivorce . She had learned it that afternoon from Lila herself , in the form of her wondering when I was going to keep my promises about Nickie . She could n't indefinitely hang on by her teeth . " Wait till tonight , " I had said mysteriously from the scaffolding , under which Crystal stood issuing her queries . " He may get his come-uppance . That 's what he needs . " " What do you mean ? " " You 'll see . He 's what is known in psychiatry as too big for his britches. "  |p96When  I declined to amplify , the exclusion from yet another plot added fuel to the fire , as I saw when I finished my decoratingand went into our bedroom . I had knelt to pin the hem of her royal gown , and , impulsively thrusting my head between her thighs , murmured a small devotional . " Oh , Chick , for God 's sake , " she said . " Why does a man always think that will make a thing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Luckily the younger Gracchi wandered in just then . Children do indeed hold two people together , but as mortar does the bricks , by also keeping them a little apart . I rose and said , " Is Blitzstein still tied up all right , ye pampered sprats o ' mine ? " An incident involving the dog had contributed to the trials of the day . A neighbor known to me chiefly as the owner of a low-slung foreign convertible had telephoned complaining that Blitzstein chased his and other cars in a way that constituted a menace on the road . The animal being a mixed Dane and German police of enormous size , he must run alongside any open sports car at about eye-level with the exposed driver , which I could well imagine was unnerving . However , when the fellow went on to protest that you could n't drive a car " faster than twenty miles an hour around here for the dogs , " I retorted that that was nearer the speed limit than his sort usually went when there were n't any dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we all four discussed the problem , Blitzstein began to bark furiously in the yard . We knew what the trouble was before we reached the window . His leash chain was hooked to slide along a fifty-foot tie-out wire strung between two trees , which gave him that much mobility  --  except when , as now , he got the leash snarled around one of the terminals and could n't move an inch . " Oh , " Fillmore groaned , " now we 've got to untangle all that chain again . Come on , Mike , you hold him while I unwind it . "  | " No , no , " I said , " that 's not necessary . You let the dog do it . Watch . " We followed me outside . Utilizing the dog 's instinct to caper in its master 's wake , I walked around that tree in a manner reversing the entanglement , in ever-winding circles , till the dog was clear of its predicament and had the freedom of the run-wire restored to it . I became quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any tedious disconnecting of chains , etc. , and to the instruction of the boys for future purposes . I had just enough time to pick up the sitter  --  a woman we knew well , named Mrs. Healy  --  before hurrying on over to the fete . ' We created quite a stir , arriving as Hitler and Cornelia , but quickly dissolved in the general grotesquerie . Our hosts had come  --  or rather were waiting for us  --  as Caesar and Cleopatra . A stuffed viper encircled IIcicn Flickcndcn 's arm while Jack 's brow was crowned with a victor 's chaplet woven of rhododendronleaves . Its weight and bulk made it keep slipping down over his eyes , like a derby a size too large , iii a manner that hampered his greetings by interfering with his recognition of the guests . A man in a moth-eaten lcopardskin dragging a spiked bludgeon sauntered up and was introduced as a house guest . " I 'm the bouncer , " he announced facetiously . The Flickendenswere in an income group statistically identified as boastinga servant and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterer 's carried the field tonight . When we arrived they still outnumbered the guests . The house was of the contemporary order undoubtedly dear to glaziers , and was set in a most uneven terrain . The property totaled seven acres , which had seemed ample protection when bought in a bygone July , but with the first shedding of autumn foliage were discovered to be mostly vertical ; so that in anything but dense summer the Flickendens found themselves sitting in a nude hollow ringed by neighbors watching from nearby porchesp98of a more traditional cast , like spectators in an amphitheater . Even now , barefoot children could be seen stealing down the wooded slopes to witness the revels . " People in glass houses should n't throw parties , " said a voice at my side . Nickie had on a tight salt-and-pepper coat , jodhpurs and leather puttees , and a tweed cap worn with the peak behind . I took this in uncertainly . " I thought you were coming as an ass , " I said . It was n't until Lila twitched up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea began to take shape , and then only partially . We guessed she was a star of the silent screen , but Nickie 's part in the gag was n't clear until he explained , " I 'm her favorite cameraman , " executing a brief pantomimeof cranking a handle . It was very cute , and one of the hits of the evening . Trust him to do something sweet and second-fiddlishjust when you had your belly full of him . It would be a mistake , however , to think that there could be any mood between us when he had n't but to embrace an opinionfor me to abandon it . To a knot of us forming there , I was expounding the position that women artists failed to equal the masterpieces of men because of an inability , or unwillingness , to plumb the dark side of life when I noted the nodding gleam which prefaced Nickie 's adoption of your opinion for more brilliant summation , and prepared to scrap it in mid-statement . So that by the time he opened his trap I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , definitely , " he said , speaking for the special benefit of a lovely girl in a Japanese kimono who had just joined the group . " Most women novelists , for instance , do n't really delineate good and evil , not by our standards anyway , but degrees of good . Take Jane Austen . A villain by her would pass comfortably for a stuffed shirt in the world of almost any contemporary writer . "  | " Oh , fiddlesticks , " I said , through the girl 's laughter . " You 're oversimplifying it . " " But is n't that what you just . . . ? " " Not at all . I was making a distinction between men and women , and you 've twisted it into one between the past and present . Do n't put words in my mouth . " There was a confused lull . At which Nickie flung out his own topic for conversation . " Guess what , " he said , darting a malicious glance at me . " Pete Cheshire is out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for good behavior . Did only a couple years of his sentence , if that . " " Oh , " said the girl in the kimono , " is n't that the jewel thief who called himself the Smoothie ? And did n't you put him away ? " In addition to giving Nickie the spotlight as Cheshire 's adversarythe news had for him the further value of irritating me . My ignorance of developments meant that Cheshire had been paroled to someone other than the Lamplighter , this time . Not that I wanted him in my hair again , God knew , but it injured one 's pride not to have been consulted . Nickic launched a profoundanalysis of Cheshire 's character that suddenly made me prick up my ears to the realization that it was n't in the Conan Doyle vein that he fancied himself at all , but something a cut subtler . ' What literary wave length was this ? Tantalized , I listened . " All hopes of reforming ' a bloke like that are futile because , while he has a morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sin was in getting caught , so the redemption can only be the perfectcrime  --  not going straight . " " What were you saying a minute ago about a tortured psyche ? " I said . " Would you develop that ? " It was coming to me , the literary beat here . A little more of this and I would have it.  | " Morons , too , can be complex . I was trying to suggest that Pete 's rather involved make-up requires him to live down , not his crime , but his arrest . It 's almost a religious drive with him , ' this urge to meet all the cliches  --  you might even say the Ten Commandments  --  of his trade . He 's got to Strike When Least Expected , and all the rest of it . It would n't surprise me if he pulled a job tonight - the day of his release . It 's a kind of invertedEthic with him , pulling a baffler  --  the final expiation for past shortcomings . " Graham Greene . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I might have known Nickie did n't fancy himself anything so old hat as Sherlock Holmes . He ' was n't just a connoisseur of crime  --  he was a student of sin . " I see what you mean , " I said as the others , out of their depth or distracted by newly arriving friends , wandered off one by one till Nickie and I were alone . " Vanity is often at odds with self-interest , and that 's why we sometimes fail to recognize it . But it 's there , operating in the other fellow when we least expect it . " I gritted my teeth , waiting for the transformation of this dross into gold . " The Ego , " Nickie said at last , nodding agreement , " is the conscience of the psyche . " " Cowplop , " I said and , turning on my heel in time to see him in a wall mirror shaking his head after me , flounced out of the room . Area rather , for the house was of the one-vast-space variety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture . Having flounced out of the living area into the dining , I got myself a drink at the bar there and sat down in a corner to get myself in a Graham Greene frame of mind . If that was the way he was playing it , that was the way I would have to play it  --  if I was to handle him intelligently and properly conclude what I had begun . I could look into the kitchen area and see the telephone  --  a stick of dynamite timedp101to go off at twelve . Two hours and a half to establish the eveningfirmly on Graham Greene lines . Decency was for a Eastern city remarkable in the number of people who refused to be converted . They continued to burn coal . Old houses were the rule , Colonial cottages whose ownersfelt the purr of oil furnaces at odds with original floors buckled into precarious angles and beams on which heads were struck . These hazards had an obscure hilarity , as of New Englandconsciences uneasily appeased , Puritan ancestors from whom the properties had been unworthily inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary homes like the Flickendens ' were still comfortably the exception ; perhaps the suburban element they augured could yet be held at bay ; the commuters stopped at the gates . For this Decency was in a favored pocket of Connecticut . Beyond the commuting limits , it was outside suburbia , exurbia , and all the rest . But briefly during the summer there was a scatteringof New Yorkers who week-ended at the waterside cottages . The Cape was too far for them , Westport not far enough . They were professional people mostly , and a handful of British UN personnel . There was a growing clique of the last whom American hostesses like Helen Flickenden yearned to mix with the local residents , in vain . The elements kept separating as inevitably as cream and milk in a bottle . It was simple to tell the British from the Americans , even without the clues of speech and through the dense thickets of disguise . The English ate as they talked ; the Americans merely talked while they ate . It was churlish to note the trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the one ; no doubt a millennium would suffice for the raw young country straining in its materialist traces , sweating to produce more air conditioners , more snorkels and ballpoint pens than any other , while its parent would go on from prime to senility , dribblingp102her gruel and owing all the world . Meanwhile the hog bestrode the world , scattering its billions to all who wanted . It had not yet learned the civilized knack of the French to nick you for just what the traffic will bear . Swallow felt an old pain beginning to throb . One could n't help preferring the English as one 's spiritual sort , yet the betrayalalways exacted its price . Nothing so intimately bound Swallow to his own kind as the pathos with which he viewed their unworthiness . He sat with eyes hooded and finger tips grazing the green shag rug that lay like an indoor turf in half the American homes , while the cock crew and crew . The difference in the costumes crucified him . Contrasted with the quiet originality of the Englishmen 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four pirates , a few skeletons , another troglodyteto keep the house guest company . A rangy man wanderedby in a checked shirt and black string bowtie ; leaving unclear whether he was a Bohemian artist or a cattleman of the olden time . A human fish swam into view , enigmatically flourishinga tuning fork . Its wife pointed to it and said " Do n't you get it ? Al 's a tuna  --  a piano tuna . " The lash of pity came down . Swallow closed his eyes . He heard the fish say , making off , " Got to practice my scales . " When he opened his eyes again it was to see Bulwinkle standing in front of him . Across his middlewas a canvas vendor 's apron , in the pockets of which he kneaded fistfuls of change . " Extra peebah ! " he was saying . " Read all about it . Extra ! " His fly was open , adding a fathom to Swallow 's despair . When Swallow dared to open his eyes again it was to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman . Dressed as Satan , he shyly fingered a trident . " You look like the devil in that , Art , " Swallow joked . Guilt demanded that he acknowledge his citizenship by calling out vacuities in the manner of Americans . That brought the knout down with twice its sting . The pain was an anodynep103to guilt . He squirmed till a loose spring in his chair was wedged more uncomfortably against his haunch . The need to expiate never ended . He was glad to see a dead bug in his drink . When there was nothing else to wince under , he winced under the need to wince . He glanced at the telephone , braced for that anguish . A stick of dynamite timed to go off at twelve .. . A couple entered of whom the man looked familiar . He wore a sort of dual costume . In faultless evening dress above the waist , he was in tramp 's rags below . On his arm was a slender ash-blonde woman of forty , draped as Guinevere . " Charles has come as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands to his face . He had recognized Appleyard in the tails and baggy pants . The latter 's plot was laid bare in a flash , which also clarified to Swallow his own role as its butt . Appleyard wanted to marry again , and for that had to get his daughter off his hands . What woman , least of all this Arthurian beauty , would put up with the likes of Sweetie ? Was this to be a fresh voice in the chorus demanding miracles of Swallow while they heaped him with slurs ? Appleyard had spotted him and was piloting his prize over . An introduction was impossible to avoid . Swallow experienced the wave of nausea we feel in the presence of superlative beauty . He rose , steeling himself to meet her . She was a seaboard type he certainly knew : the women with eyes like coins in whose metallic laughter lurked the ghost of girlish mirth , the years of Vassar or Wellesley , of autographed raincoats and furtive snacks after Lights Out ; the love of boys so quickly hardened into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what their mothers had scrupulously taught them to forage for : the fifty thousand a year and the house in Rye with the turf of rug like this , the servant and a half and the wine-colored Cadillac . And daughters to train to avoid what their mothers had them : the cottage in Tenafly with a man who left his spoon in hisp104coffee when he drank , hooking his thumb around it , and children with allergies who played pieces ; the winters of " activities " in the Godforsaken Methodist church and the stinking summerson the back porch with root beer and cookies and a neighborbaritone singing " Shipmates o ' Mine . " She would have buried or shed a husband or two already , and Appleyard would not be the last . But Swallow wanted her because her lipstick was ragged . " Hello , hello . " Appleyard smelled of some costly concentrate for men . Was this just the upper half of him , while he reeked of some abomination below ? " I 'd like to present Mrs. Bickerstaffe . Eve , this is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pair of pruned eyebrows rose in greeting . " Oh , yes . Of course . Delighted . " The accent was n't Eastern at all , but English . " We must have a little chat . Charles , do get us drinks . " She was unmistakably British . In her voice rustled the thin paper on which the air editions of the better English journals are printed , in America used for wiping eyeglasses and binding cigarettes . Perhaps the Americans saw too clearly to have vision ? They lacked the touch of fog responsible for the mysticism that made English poetry great . Swallow saw her nose was irregular ; he looked for more of the flaws that breed desire through pity . Her hair was darker at the roots ... he felt the bowels of mercy stir . If her stocking scams were crooked , he would want her then and there . Ile threw a stricken look at the terrace door , a thousand miles away . Through it swept a bell-shaped woman in dense veils who bore mercifully down on Mrs. Bickerstaffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had built its nest of coleslaw strands . With the instinctive courtesy of the British , Mrs. Bickerstaffe turned her back on Swallow , no doubt sensing his embarrassment . Over his shoulder he saw the back of Appleyard'stailcoat . " I must tell Charles something , " he murmured , and chased it toward the bar.  |p105He  tapped Appleyard on the shoulder . " There 's something I 've been meaning to tell you , old man . " " What ? " " Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . It slipped both our minds . The individual relives the history of the race . Boys enact the hunting and fishing era , children naturally seek out caves , corners below stairs , any dark hole . ' That 's ontogeny recapitulatesphylogeny . Ask anybody . " Appleyard chewed a canape plucked from a passing tray , wiping a finger across his brow like a squeegee across a pane of glass . " Eve 's crazy about you . " " But we 've only just met ! " " I 've told her all about you . She 's delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know you better . " " And how is Sweetie ? " " Granny told me she gave you her poems to read . Have you thought any more about it ? I mean , really , what arc your plans ? " " Why , to get her poems printed , " Swallow heard himself say . " You forget one thing . They 're not publishable . " Appleyard was picking a flaw in his logic politely , as one picks a bit of cork from a guest 's wineglass . " I 've read them . They 're like parodies of everybody since The Man with the Hoe . ' " " That 's how we 'll publish them . As a volume of parodies . " Almost peacefully Swallow listened to himself go mad . Were he told it was on the strength of the nonsense he was jabbering that he would have to stand and deliver , lie would have gone out and thrown himself into the Sound . Why not ? The Atlantic deeps were more a home than this . He was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town as to be hastily rewritten for the laughs they unintentionally provoked , and brought into New York as successful farces . But that only happened in plays themselves . " They 'll have to be completely reworked , of course . Begin/ping with a whole new viewpoint , a sophistication about herselfand what she 's been doing , that we 'll have to develop first . Old man . " Appleyard nodded , pursing his lips . " It might just be worth a try . Beerbohm . . . " he babbled . Why must we bleed at every pore for one another , Swallow thought . He said : " I 'll help all I can , of course . " " And I 'll see that you 're left alone together , you two . " Swallow stumbled across the turf to a divan where he sank between a knave of hearts and a man with his head in a scarf and gold bands hanging from his ears , from which hairs also verdantly sprang . The latter turned , smiling . " I 'm a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two ? " " They could n't come . " There was no mistaking the stiff upper lip , the long AngloSaxonface . He was English all right , Seeing It Through . Englishto the marrow of his bones . " My name is Gluckstern . " Mumbling that he had troubles of his own , Swallow apologeticallyrose and staggered back to where Eve Bickerstaffe was still standing , free of the birdlore woman and looking for Appleyard . Swallow had to know what she knew , quickly , before his nerves went . When he gained her side , they stood grinning at one another . She tapped the front if his paint-spattered overalls and said , " Heil . " " Have you known Charles long ? " " Oh , yes . Some months . " " Then you know the others . Quite a household . I take it you 've met Mme. Piquepuss . " " Rather ! " " And Sweetie ? " " Ah . " Appleyard 's arm thrust a drink toward her . He didn'tp107join them , being occupied with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eve Bickerstaffe drank , after a gesture to his health . She watched him as she sipped , as though waiting for him to speak . " Yes , she is a strange case . No one quite knows what she 's thinking . Of course I 've been rather close to her  --  closer than anyone in some ways  --  and the family sort of expect me to  --  pull her out of it . Appleyard  --  Charles had told you some versionof something , away back , I suppose ? " " It 's too bad , of course . Yes , some brouhaha down cellar or something . I 'm not quite sure I . . . What happened exactly ? " " I know now what it was . " Swallow drew a deep breath , taking care not to inhale the crumbs of a canape , and looked over her head , analytically squinting one eye . " You see , Sweetie always roused in you the protective instinct . That appealing helplessness . . . " he said . " You wanted to shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . reach out , urn ... " " I understand . " Eve Bickerstaffe drank again , watching him with a gentle gravity . " Were you in prison ? " " No , " he said , " I was n't . " Among the people swirling like a bright lava through the terrace doors was Jack Flickenden , flushed with excitement . The crown of victory had slipped over one ear . The fish-man forged past , pointing to the bar . " Get stewed to the gills ... " The telephone rang at ten minutes to twelve . Swallow was standing alone in a corner , wincing under the need to wince , when he saw Helen Flickenden run to Nickie after answering it and whisper something in his ear . Nickie nodded , twisting out a cigarette , and rose . Swallow put pity from him . A surgeon with tears in his eyes is worthless  --  a menace . God had no pity . He had compas/lion . Pity was the underside of the coin of contempt . It is the one one ' nobody gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beacons for an era verging toward its Night , Swallow mused . They relieved without dispelling the gloom , like fireflies garnishing a dusk over which hover the incurious and eternal stars . But they would have to do , both for the cruel brevity of life and its appalling length . Everyone was piling into cars . Word had buzzed round about what Nickie Sherman had been summoned for , and a macabre gaiety was in the making . On the clipped lawn ( resembling a rug so much more than the turf of shag inside ) Swallow saw his wife glance speculatively over at him as she climbed into the Flickendens ' growling MG . Swallow found himself in a congested limousine with Nickie on his lap . Lila sat beside them , a hand on Nickic 's wrist ; they had been like that all evening , affectionately linked again in the unity of their costumes . Swallow could hear her mind ticking : " This may be his Big Chance . " Nickie 's cap was switched to rights , the peak in front . Was it his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all a jape , and no one need drink up eisel . But was n't the whole idea that someone drink up eisel ? It was how the prescription read ... . The Markeys ' house was a blaze of lights . Sue met them at the door in a quilted wrapper , her hair loose and gesturing hysterically . She had always overacted on the stage ; it was why she was a housewife now . Nickie bustled importantly inside , an arm around Sue , while most of the thrill seekers , chastened and a little ashamed , waited in the yard or on the road in their cars . Swallow followed Lila and Crystal into the vestibule , then on into the parlor . The body was sprawled face-up on a couch , its head hanging over the edge and its tongue lolling between clenched teeth . The sight reminded Swallow of those faces scrawled on schoolyardwalls with the caption , " Teacher . " A length of cord , tornp109from some electric appliance , was twisted around the neck . Ted Markey was in pajamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises for clues . He avoided rather squeamishly the body itself , Swallow noted . " When did you discover him , Mrs. Markey ? " he asked , stoopingto read the title of a book spread-eagled on the rug beside the couch . " I know this is difficult , but try to remember . " " Why , just now , " Sue said , " when I called you . I had been washing some things out while Ted caught up on his reading . There 's the book . I went in to ask him something and found  --  this . Oh , God . He was only thirty-four ! " She buried her face on Swallow 's shoulder . " We were so happy together . Why should anyone want to do a thing like this to Ted ? " Nickie opened and shut the drawers of a buhl cabinet , looked down out the open window . " Robbery was not the motive , " he said . " Have you notified the police ? " " I wanted you to see it first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you were and I called there . I hope you do n't mind . " " Of course not , Mrs. Markey . The police do their best , " Nickie said generously . " You might call them now . I 'll have seen all I need before they get here and disturb the scene . This was a wanton crime , committed by a man of medium height or slightly under , wearing a dark blue sweater and sneakers with thick crepe soles . " " How can you tell ? " Lila asked . " How did you know that , Nickie ? " " It 's possible to deduce both from the position of the body and something about the window . Entry was made through the window , which was only a third of the way open , not high enough for a man of any size . There are footprints in the flower bed of a pattern made only by those thick gum soles . There 's a snag of blue wool under this splinter on the sill . You see ? "  |p110Swallow  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , as playgoers do a corpse on the stage . No motion was discernible . Had Ted been in the theater too ? Swallow could n't remember . Could the wire round the neck have accidentally got too . . . ? He saw only the lewd judge droning sentence , the visitors bringing him tangerines on Sunday , the attempted suicide with rotten suspenders . . . Sue shifted a chair cushion and raked her hair . Evidently she was running out of dramatic resources . " He was going to get a promotion next month , " she stated into a handkerchief . Nickie at last stepped over and examined the prostrate form more closely . He bent an ear to the chest and listened a moment , then transferred his study to the tongue . He drew the bottom lid of one eye down with his thumb and examined the eyeball . Swallow closed his own eyes and prayed that Ted Markey had had experience on the Elizabethan stage , or even the Grand Guignol , to account for the total lack of rise and fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strollingsat Sue . " Perhaps one of the others can phone them for you , " he said . " The police . You 're probably in no condition to . " She buried her face in her hands , shaking her head distractedly . " I 'd get the Fire Department . " The sofa creaked as the corpse got to its feet . " Better let me do it , darling , " Ted said . " You 've had a trying night . " Those in the room took steps in varying directions . Then they all froze , and looked at one another like participants in a ritual of which the exact sequence had been forgotten . Ted and Sue grinned at one another , then at the rest , who somewhat woodenlyfollowed suit . People seemed to be baring their teeth for the purpose of comparing dental work . One side of Nickie 's face twitched up , like that of a man drawing a shred of food from his teeth . Swallow 's wife whispered to him : " I think thisp111is the most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swallow rocked faintly on the balls of his feet , like the Ghost in more sensitive productions of Hamlet , while a deep sunburn overspread Nickie 's features . Lila went to Nickie 's side and took his arm . " He knew it all the time , only he did n't want to spoil your fun , " she said . " Come on , Nickums , tell us when you first knew it was a hoax . Play fair now , be honest . When did you first tumble , and what was it that gave the game away ? Flow did you know ? " Swallow sat on the back porch of his house , on the worn glider , staring over the trees at the rising sun . A drained coffee cup stood at his elbow . He looked up " cisel " for the third time , in as many dictionaries . This one defined it simply as vinegar , just like the others , but noted its use in Hamlet : " Woul't drink up eisel ? " As he set it aside he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tread ? Like a signature on the stair . He knew Crystal was standing in the doorway in the faded flower wrapper . " I did n't sleep a wink , " she said . " Do you think I liked doing it ? " " Oh , no more of that infinitely gentle , infinitely suffering business , please . You 've been going around like a Graham Greene character all night . All that knowledge-of-weariness and weariness-of-knowledge , **51;647;TOOLONG . " " Can I pour you some coffee ? " " There 's no more cream . " Seeing her shuffle onto the porch in a robe even drabber than he 'd remembered , Swallow felt an old tightening of the shackle of love . Why do we celebrate beauty when it is a threadbare house garment , a new wrinkle , a sagging shoulder that bind us with bands of steel ? He recalled that he had married her notp112in a tide of passion but because her mother had sunburned her face through a basket , making the whole family too ridiculous to desert . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought three dozen . Love was the prisoner of pity ; lust fed on the very shocks of intimacy , renewed itself on pain and rage . Every embrace is a collision . And so on . He leaned over on the glider and pressed his hands against the sides of his head , as though by squeezing thought from his brain he might still the throb of paradox . " I got so tired of whistling down the wind with him , Chris . " He willed himself not to vomit ; what he let out instead was a gorge of verbalized misery . He spoke leaning over , and imaginedwhat he said to constitute a widening pool on the rattan mg . " You see , the thing he had to be shown is that there 's no adversary for him . Not that he is n't brilliant himself , but that life offers no Raffles to use it on . He 's like half of a pair of scissors . Therefore , no living in it . And my sister with huge rents to pay , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents . " " Oh , Jesus . " She leaned her brow on the window frame , her arms hanging at her sides as though her nervous system were losing touch with parts of her at an alarming rate . " He threatened to kill himself . Did you know that ? " Her foot of itself recovered a mule it had lost . " I simply had to get him down out of that balloon . More is not asked of a man than he can take . We think of the failure of theology when what we ought to get straight is the theology of failure . That you have to deserve it . Those not up to defeat are not picked for it . Ezra Pound said : For God , our God is a gallant foe that playeth behind the veil . Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail . Kill himself ? What 's that you say ? " " Yes . Can you take that on your conscience ? " Swallowp113said nothing . He wiped his moist temples with the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets all night . Lila says he was home three times and went away again . He was last seen going in the direction of the waterfront . " It is because of our relationships that we suffer . What fools we are to fear solitude . Swallow remembered a week spent alone in Vermont in the dead of winter : the stark immaculate pines standing like Breughel trees , the snow falling like grains of Bromo-Seltzer . He thought : life is a tragedy perpetuated by the passion that relieves it . " Have we any eisel in the house ? " He was not surprised to hear the telephone ring : stunned but not surprised . Crystal went to the kitchen to answer it . It would be Lila again , reporting . When Crystal ran back from the kitchen the sound of her slippers was like a horde of rats hurrying in his direction . The sun was clear of the treetops . Where did it come from , what did it want ? We groped in the dark , while the mysteries blazed down on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . A police bulletinfrom the waterfront precinct station . " Swallow had once read a fantasy concerning a country in which light traveled at the rate of ten miles an hour . Her fact reached him with that kind of dreamy leisure , while he stood apart from himself , as it were , witnessing its impact on himself . " Whuh  --  ? Whah  --  ? " He opened and closed his mouth several times , as though by so doing he might trap the right words out of the air as a dog does flies . " You 've known me long enough . Let me know in easy stages , " he said . " One , did they find him wet ? " She came forward to the glider and smoothed a cushion on it . The female urge to narrate , to make a thing of tidings . " What 's he done , for God 's sake , woman ? Out with it , by degrees ! "  | " It 's not what he 's done . It 's what somebody else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty thousand dollars ' worth of jewels from their bedroom . " Swallow was on his feet . " Pete Cheshire  --  " She nodded , her face radiant with the relief that was flooding him too . " They called Nickie immediately to retain him . As well they might , the way they laughed at the poor boy . It 's another chance for him , just in time to save his face . Or maybe even his soul . " " Where is he ? " " Safe in bed . Went to sleep like a baby when he heard about it . There 's your other half of that pair of scissors . I 'll take that coffee after all , with milk . Nickie called the shot too , that 's anotherthing in his favor . Remember how he said at the party he would n't be surprised if the Smoothie struck tonight ? Oh , it 's like a kind of miracle . Just think , Chick . Twenty thousand dollars ' worth of jewels stolen . It makes you think there 's a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty awake was none other than the Prince Charming of American letters . You know who I mean . That style was a glittering wand that had but to be flourished over the dreaming likes of Sweetie to make her sit up and rub her eyes . The long overtime childhood was finished . But it left in her a store of fissionable matter ready for the right sensibility to rearrange . By sensibility I do not mean that flabby impressionability thanks to which a man standing barefoot on a coin can tell whether it is heads or tails . I mean that almost ethereal attunement able to draw the data through shoe leather . When I first mentioned Fitzgerald to Sweetie she thought I meant the translator of The Rubaiyat , and began one of those invitational and purely academic dashes through the gorse that were so much more wearing than the bacchanals would have been of which they were the empty blueprint . I thought to myself , " No , dearie , that ballet is over .

"  |p118She  came pouting back through the gorse . " I do n't read novels . " Then that was the whole trouble ! She had been too long the prisoner of poets , who teach you only how to die , not live . This girl needed characters to ape , not verse forms  --  influenceson her conduct . For if the principle of imitation is all it seems  --  and religions call believers to perfection by no other  --  then progress is a series of successful plagiarisms , and the good life a long , translucent parody on which God the Father will grade us at the last . All the world 's a stage  --  in our development . I tumbled those glimmering pages into her lap together with This Side of Paradise and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I left her for thirty days and thirty nights . If , as I thought , she was Poetry 's little debutante , it followed as the night the day who must handle her coming out . When I called again after dinner a month later I was met in the dooryard by another girl . She emerged from the house carrying a glass of red wine from the dinner table . Her dress was a civilized summer print of a material known , I believe , as bleeding madras . The river of chocolate malted that had been her hair was gone  --  in its place a tuft of chopped gold . Even her feet were changed . She wore no shoes as yet , but there was something about them that it took me a second to place . She had been walking through money , that was it , lots of money , and you could hear it whisperinglike a green protective foliage in her path . ( One hoped her father had enough to defray whatever little improvisation she had in store for us now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful ! " she cried . " I had no idea . From now on I 'm going to live ! I 'm going to live if it kills me ! " " How will you begin ? " I sat on the porch steps fanning myself with a straw boater . There was a hushed , almost eroticp119expectancy to the night . The moon sailed like a wedge of Persian melon over the far trees . When Sweetie drank her wine I imagined it running directly into her veins . " I want to work on my poems , " she said . " I see what 's wrong with them now . They 're awful . Sweetie sorry . Sweetie ashamed . " Instead of behaving childishly as heretofore , she deliberately talked baby talk , thus keeping at a fashionable remove from herself , which was something else altogether , and quite fabulousin its way . This gained degree of detachment put her poetry in its first perspective . " But maybe I can turn their very awfulness to account . Make conscious parodies out of the unconsciousthat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them published . " She laughed into her wine and then laid a hand over the glass , as though she were trying to bottle the night 's mirth , or had just jailed a bright bug . " Sweetie dying to go New York . Want toofums filled by someone better than old Decency dentist anyway . Sweetie want to sec the Ritz . " " It 's been torn down . " " Then Sweetie go Plaza . Sit in lobby and see if the music makes the palm trees quiver . Oh Chick , the sands arc running  --  every morning I 've been rubbing another night 's worth out of my eyes and never knowing it . I want to do something . I 've begun work on some of the poems already . Would you like to hear them ? " " Very much . " She recited her revisions in an eager murmur , hugging her drawn-up knees and gazing at the sky . Now , you sniveling hypochondriac , Your sort of thing is done ; Drop that pillbox right away And get inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your stomach 's bent on bolting ;  |p120Do  n't turn and run because you find ' The masses are revolting . " Auden , " I said . " I yuv you ! " She kissed me in a burst of gratitude for having guessed . A window slid either up or down  --  it makes no differencewhich . " It 's now a much better satire on the whole ivory-tower proletarianism of that day , " I said when I could speak . " What else ? " She reeled off several more , all showing the same ripening mondanite at work . One thing about the late-bloomer is that it usually blooms fast . I fancied I could see Sweetie improvethe way you can see the hand of a clock move if you watch closely . I do n't know how long we sat there . The melonsliceof moon paled as it climbed the sky from Persian to cranshaw ; from cranshaw to casaba . The stars struck me as a handful of hot rivets precariously holding together a night threatening to burst under the strain of too much ecstasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of crucifixion and exclaimed , " The Riviera ! " " The Palm Beach of the old country , " I smiled at my pupil , wiping at a stain of claret on my hatband . I shifted on my haunch , half-crazed by a night so drenched in implication . " I had an idea about your Frost , " I said . " Put back even the little you 've changed of the original . Leave the title and the entire first stanza exactly as he has them  --  Whose woods these are I think I know . His house is in the village though ; He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow .. .  --  only capitalize village ' to make it Greenwich Village the owner lives in  --  " "  --  and the poem a satire on the city man dabbling inp121bucolics ! The whole suburbanite thing ! " She gave the editorial hand a grateful squeeze as Appleyard fluttered into view around the side of the house . He made apologetically for the glider from which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile of discreet excitement , a kind of deferential frenzy . " I 'll get her between covers yet , " I called . " I know . " In addition to whipping half the old poems into shape according to the agreed-on plan , Sweetie wrote several new ones for the book-length manuscript at which we now drove , all in the course of the next few weeks . She worked at the same fever pitch as that in which A Shropshire Lad was forged by A. E. Housman , who was , as a matter of fact , represented in the new crop : Loveliest of pies , the cherry now Completes a fine repast ; ' T is not the first I 've ordered , lads , But it will be the last . For soon they 'll slit my trouser-legs And shave my head , and thenThey 'll sit me in the chair from which I 'll never rise again . The lengthy error known as Life Began in a single cell , And that is where for luckless lads It sometimes ends as well . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal curse . And that 's what comes of reading Pessimistic verse.  |p122My  own favorite was one that took off from Byron 's " She Walks in Beauty , " probably because I relished being in the know as to its private origins ( how we love to have literature reduced to gossip ! ) . For it projected perfectly at last that fear of the Chintz Prison that haunted Sweetie , as it may well haunt every woman : She walks in beauty like the nightWatchman on appointed rounds , In the nursery , checking children'sWinter respiratory sounds . Robed in flannel she comes hither , Shod in slippers she goes hence , Sits behind the desk and reckonsUp the measure of their pence . Bedded late , she rises early , And swings before his sallow nose The coffeepot , her morning censer , Which is better than the rose . Before the leaves fell we had a book together , and before the snow flew , published  --  under the name of Beth Appleyard . I knew a Bridgeport printer of trashy comics who did occasional art books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a brochure on deckle-edged paper bound in maroon vellum , sellingat two dollars . It did n't set the world on fire but it did Sweetie , who packed up and lit out for the Village , among whose espresso shops and walk-up apartments she found enough kindred spirits , liberally enough sprinkled with admirers , to make her stay on . Rumors of how the Mocking Bird Girl was carrying on down there boomed like breakers up the dull shores of Decency . And before the buds were out I was called on the carpet again at the vine-choked cottage on Beacon Street.  | " What have you done to her now ? " A prostrate Appleyard put the query this time . He lay on a mound of pillows , a medicated sock of a tasteful pattern pinned around his neck , and a crick in his back . The latter was an injury sustained , according to the attendant Eve Bickerstaffewho had done the phoning in terms of asking me to tea , from too much exercise in a rowing machine he had in the basement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waywarddaughter . The effigy of Adlai Stevenson dissolved into that of an old woman in a nightgown which I was a moment in placing . Thomas Wolfe 's mother on the publication of Look Homeward , Angel . Had it not put her to bed , pale , the model of familial slaughter in our time ? If Appleyard was going to be derivative too .. . " You 've heard about Sweetie ? " he whispered , fingering the sock in a way that subtly shifted our problem onto a new plane . " I hear from her now and again . Why ? " " Not from her  --  about her . They 're not the same thing at all . " There was the groan of a bedspring followed by a human one  --  or perhaps the other way around  --  as Appleyard sat up a little on his pillows , dealing them a series of blows . An electriccord led to a heating pad under his hack . The box the pad had come in was on the counterpane . On its cover was a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voluptuously fingering the thermostat . " Just what do you want of me ? " I asked . " A balance between what she once was and what she is now . Something in between . A little sense of proportion , please ! " " I 'll get it right yet , " I said from the foot end of the bed . " I 'll get her right yet . But I think I ought to have a clearer picture of how things stand at the moment . What exactly have you heard ? If you can give me some idea . " He laughed and fell back among the pillows , as if the sightp124of parental collapse were description enough of the sins being committed under my auspices . Eve Bickerstaffe leaned down and touched his brow with a damp handkerchief . " He 's weak , " she said . " We 're none of us a tower of strength , " I answered charitably . Her glare told me how I had mistaken her meaning , on which I murmured a word of apology with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't like him . Please sit clown , " she said , noting my quest for a chair not too discourteously far from the sickbed . I settled on a wicker hassock shaped like an hourglass which creaked furiously under my weight . I noted among the medicine bottles the consoling presence of a pint of Four Roses , and licked my lips . Curiosity was the one bearableingredient in my emotions , and I was resolved not to have it short-changed . " I must know what you hear about Sweetie , in order intelligentlyto proceed with this thing . Can you be specific ? " " Oh . " He gave a deprecatory wave , and a bit of the old Appleyard returned in the will to disapprove on intellectual rather than moral grounds . " The usual kind of Girl Cutting Loose the Minute She Gets Away from Her Family . Is n't the Jazz Age supposed to have gone out with Fitzgerald ? " " There 's a new jazz Age , " I said , " and a Fitzgerald revival in full swing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper . " " Well , I 'm not casual ! ' Wait till you have daughters dancing on the table in their shift ! " Appleyard summoned his polemic resources for a last heave onto his elbow as he fixed me with a sharp eye . " You realize it would kill her grandmother to hear about this . Of course we 're doing our best to keep it from her . So shh ! Here she comes now . " Mme. Piquepuss looked anything but distraught , whatever she may have overheard . Spruce in green taffeta , and only a little bent under ancestral jewelry , she nodded to me as shep125crossed the room to a window chair . It had been otherwise at our last meeting , when I 'd reported on the poems she had stolen for me to read . When Mine . Piquepuss learned they were derivative she was fit to be tied . She thumped her cane , snatched up knickknacks and flung them to the floor , in a rage at having this bridge to the world for her grand-daughter blown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vestigialhuman being so much as an incipient poltergeist . I forewent any actual exegesis of the text . Accusing her of having an heir who dealt in double entendre would have meant gewgaws flyingin my own direction , while detailed analysis of symbolisms might have put me in receipt of more than bric-a-brac . It was enough to have to explain to Sweetie the sort of thing she was trying to do  --  where she was infusing her work with Freudian elements , where Marxist . Now , as I say , it was happily otherwise . Mme. Piquepuss laid a hand on my shoulder as she passed : blessings on a friend who , by alchemies and devices themselves of no interest to her , had set her child on the road to the world at last . But the other two went on about getting Sweetie home . I sensed between Appleyard and La 13ickcrstaffc a nervous conspiracy . The latter kept depositing finger tips on the buttons of her blouse , as on the stops of a flute . " So we were hoping you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and look in on her in the Village , " she said . " What ! Like Lambert Strether in The Ambassadors sent to spy on What's-his-name in Paris ? " I saw the miles of relentlessly combed Jamesian syntactical fleece stretching away into a dubious future , and rejected it out of hand ; unwisely perhaps , since I was groping for a literary formula that would get us all out of this mess , some mystique as potent to stop the spell as the Faulkner had been to start it . But I did not see this as Henry James . I saw us as long out of those drawing roomsp126slogging steadily across the Waste Land we had blundered into in search of the Other Side . God only knew what was on the Other Side , but we had to cross the Waste Land to see . I was glad at any rate to hear Appleyard croak from the hill of pillows : " Oh , nothing like that , old man . Just tell her we still love her and want her to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window scat . " But she is having fun . Let her have her fling . " Appleyard hitched himself up again . " I do n't want to have to cut her off with a penny ! " As though he were dying in a great Galsworthian bed ! Fever or no fever I sensed something fishy here . The room was swelling with hypocrisy . Then in an instant it was all clear . It was when the old beldame , in response to that Galsworthiandeath rattle , coughed into her fist and said , " I send her checks enough to live on . Let her have her fling . This way she will meet some nice yunk man , n'est-ce pas ? " A startled glance between Appleyard and his bride-elect as she fled for the kitchen teapot told me the story . The old woman was living her life over again in the young . The candles had been snuffed on her parties long ago , but she remembered the waltzes in vanished gardens , the lovers swirlingin the soft French nights , the champagne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her beloved Proust reminds us that when aged people seem to sit with their dim eyes fixed at a point in space six feet in front of them , they are actually looking at something sixty years behind . . . Dream away , Mme. Piquepuss , I get the whole thing now . It is the middle-aged plotters we have on our hands now . They 're scared stiff that in a burst of senility you 'll cut them off with a penny , leaving everything to that girl who has found the road to the world at last . . . . How I had misjudged the woman , as menace ! She was n't the American Puritan at all , only the Gallic grandmerep127bent on seeing the Dance of Life go on . Her skittishness about any irregularities in the order of events was understandable enough . There was a story that a sister of hers , on a long-ago railway journey to Petrograd aimed at healing a romantic sorrow , had been ravished by Rasputin . A silence fell among the rattle of crockery in the kitchen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Becauseshe had some . Money mates with money . The two lie down together and breed themselves endlessly upon one another .. . " I do n't sleep for worrying about it , " Appleyard whispered . " I want my girl home . Where a man can keep an eye on things . I do n't sleep any more . " " You slept last night , " Mme. Piquepuss offered encouragingly . " I looked in a few times . " She sat tranquilly , the eagle eyes in repose , the chocolate fingers on the table-edge before her . They looked like a row of eclairs which a butler might presently serve us in silver tongs with our tea . But when tea came we had sponge cake augmented by certain gray strawberries . " Well , I do n't rest when I sleep , " Appleyard resumed . " Anyoneknows that when you 're worried about something you can sleep eight hours or even ten and wake up feeling just as tired as when you lay down . " " Or even tireder , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been unmasked and we knew where we stood . The ass in bed had forfeited my sympathy but I felt guilty at the rather notorious Freudianism that came to mind : how offspring out to set the world on fire often want only to burn the old man up . Well , he had missed the boat on her poetry . He had thought the stuff hopeless . I did not begrudge the losers my good offices for that one last trip to New York they asked of me . After all , my aim was to extricate myself from l'affaire Appleyard as gracefully asp128possible , and a graceful exit usually means a leisurely one . My father gave me one good piece of advice in his lifetime . " Never slant a swinging door , " he said . I had had too much kickback as it was . So I took the tea and ate the cake and walked out of that house with a kind of gingerly tact . Which was just how , two Saturdays later , I walked into Sweetie 's . At least into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I began to wonder whose it was soon after she admittedme . " Chickie ! Come in , come in . " She sang to the tune of camel bells , or some local silversmith'sequivalent dangling from her wrist . The clatter of wooden sandals on the bare floor was intermittently muffled on the archipelago of small rugs we crossed to reach the living room . Her nails were a pale green now , and her lipstick seemed brown , though that may have been a trick of the light . I became aware of conversation other than ours . A young man with pink hair was sitting on a carousel horse in a corner and telling a girl parked on a rattan stool , " You ca n't say that about Bea Lillie . I wo n't let you . " The girl had wheat-colored hair hanging over one eye , which made her seem to be watching you from behind a curtain . Sweetie introduced them as Bill de Chavannes and Ursula Thorpe , and hurried off to get us drinks . I stood at an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillie , whom he described as a masculine Oscar Wilde . The window gave on a tiny courtyard in which more children than there are in Decency were playing at more games than I had known existed . " Sort of a Breughel effect , " said Ursula , who had drifted to my side . Sweetie returned with highballs and the remark that she still did n't know " where he keeps everything . " hrom which provocativeclue flowered the facts of her present life . " When Danny talked about his convertible , " Bill laughed , " Beth thought hep129meant a Cadillac or at least a Lincoln , and went home with him . " " What kind of convertible did he have ? " I asked . " Castro , " Bill said , indicating the davenport on which I sat . From this and other Restoration exchanges I gathered that there was a bon mot circulating in the Village that went , " I have a rendezvous with Beth . " It was said to have originated with Dylan Thomas  --  whom there was now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droppers-in if they 'd seen him , and even yelling out the window . " It 's no use , " said Bill at last , dismounting the horse . " Ile 's reading this week end at Bennington or a Wclsli workmen 's local or something like that . Danny ! " he finished as the master of the house strode in . I saw a baked face with handsome features which included the diamond-shaped eyes of the Irish . Danny Dolan carried himself with a scrupulous erectness , as though lie had once encountered the phrase , " the lean , clean breed , " and vowed to live up to it . But he was clearly out of his clement in this flat of his . His father owned a steel mill which enabled him to own some racing horses  --  the carousel steed was n't the only sign of his passion in the room . I k was just back from Philadelphia where a three-year-old of his had been operated on at the University of Pennsylvania School of VeterinaryMedicine for the removal of a chip from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runningof the Belmont stakes . " He was all right in there , " he told us , accepting Sweetie 's own highball . " I knew he was a smart horse , but the way he cooperated when they gave him the anesthetic was wonder-ful . " " Sort of a Hemingway hero , " Ursula murmured , lip at glass . Danny roamed from seat to seat like a man trying out chairsin a furniture store . " Where shall we eat ? " he asked with a kindp130of truculent hospitality , the sense of strain put on limited emotionsby playing host to a constant flow of superiors . Beth removed from the refrigerator a gory butcher 's parcel which she opened for our inspection on a stack of magazines . " I bought this meat , and got to thinking I might cook it . But what is it ? I forget what the butcher said . " We studied the bloody still life from our respective distances , without profit , yet as though it rang a bell . Ursula succeeded in identifying it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny rose and gave his belt a hitch . " We 're a rotten set , " he said with some smugness , or at least the wistful hope that he " belonged . " He glared at the window and then around to the rest of us , his diamond eyes glittering . " Let 's go to the Aching Joint , " somebody said . " Let 's go to the Onomatopoeia , " somebody else said . " There 's a new comedian there with a death wish , who gets his head out of a noose just in time . " Bill rose to announce his suggestion . " Let 's call Mary Troiseme . I hear she 's back at Rye . " Thus it was that I found myself in Danny 's station wagon , which reeked provocatively of horseflesh , speeding back in the direction I had just come . In thirty minutes I would be halfwayhome again . My bag was in the rear . " Sort of a Kafka nightmare , " said Ursula , between whom and Bill de Chavannes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we twitched through traffic on Riverside Drive . " The set in Rye is even more decadent , " Bill said . " They sit on the beach drinking Vichyssoise through a straw . " " The Gauls are at the gates , " Danny said at the wheel . It had the ring of a phrase he had picked up somewhere , but he looked at Sweetie beside him in a kind of plea for credit for his cleverness . She was apparently queen of this crowd , arbiter of a worldliness which I tried to calibrate by dropping the namep131of Westport into the discussion . It aroused gales of mirth . Sweetie turned to kneel on the front seat , facing us . " Have you ever read Kafka , Chick ? " she asked . " Well , you must . Start with The Metamorphosis . It 's about a man who turns into a cockroach . " " Oh , let him alone , Beth , " Bill said . " IIe 's read archy and mehitabel . I sometimes wish that 's where I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We swept up a drive whose gravel looked as though it bathed regularly and stopped before a broad stone house around whose veranda ran a balustrade capped with marble figures in reclining positions . On the porch a woman of no attributes , wearing a hat that looked like a dove put through a wringer , stood between two leashed wolfhounds . " I 'm so glad you got here before I left because I ca n't stay , " she said , showing neither surprise nor indifference at our arrival . " You 'll find food in the refrigerator , plenty of liquor in the cellarette , and Waldo in bed . I 'm awfully sorry , but I have to go to New York . " An upper window slid open and a man 's face mangled with sleep was thrust out . " I 'm glad I mistook the Worcestershire sauce for Angostura bitters , " he called down . " It 's what we all need . And I do n't take back what I said about shoofly pie . Hello , all . " The window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a clump of rhododendrons where a taxicab was waiting in cover . " Good-by , Mary , " they all shouted . " Have fun . " " I told you the Gauls were at the gates . " Danny fell in besideme as we started for the house . IIe was shaking his head . " I know for a fact of people in Westport who roast marshy mallows on a Roto-Broil , " I offered out of a persisting chauvinismfor my home state . He danced bitterly , punching the twilight . We climbed a flight of stairs like the bed of a dried cataractp132and trooped through a cathedral door held open for us by a white-jacketed Negro chewing a soda cracker . IIe showed us to our rooms by pointing at their approximate locations through the ceiling . I alone had luggage  --  toted in the suspicion that I might never check into the Algonquin at all but go right on home from here . My memory of the next twelve hours is a blur , like a spectrumspun at a rate too fast to distinguish separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldo appeared  --  a compactlyportly man in a sleep-muffled rage  --  there was a round of parlor games and smoke-wreathed disputes through which Waldo also intermittently somnambulated . He grew more dangerously awake by the hour , however . Someone played a phonograph album given his absent wife by a previous guest , a symphony of a pioneering dissonance that made him stiffen in his chair like a convict through whom an electrical charge is being passed . Seeing this , Bill de Chavannes explained the composition 's merits . " The classical composers are n't in it for tonal violence , " he said . " To approximate that , you 'd have to play Beethoven and Brahms at the same time . " Waldo seized the album and thrust it into the annotator 's lap , in which remnantsof dessert still lingered . " Take it ! I insist  --  I 'm giving it to you ! " One of several newcomers was persuaded by a scrawny beauty in a sweater to read from his poems , a volume of which happened to be around . They were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Crating and Uncrating , " and " Mother , Walk with Me on State Highways . " " Take it , " Waldo said to the scrawny beauty who had been loudest in her praise . Beads of moisture stood on his brow . It seemed he was determined to break up housekeeping ; that when he had distributedthe furnishings he would begin on the house proper , tearing it stone from stone and handing them to passers-by . I remembered a cartoon with the caption " Do n't admire any/thing or he might give it to you , " and decided to keep my mouth shut . All the good it did me ! In a sudden silence , Sweetie looked around and said , " Where 's Danny ? " " On the veranda blowing up that rubber horse he left here last summer . He said he 's going for a swim . " " He 'll turn into a horse , like that man in Kafka who turned into a cockroach , " said Ursula , who was beside me on a couch . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wrist , " Do n't feel too bad about the arclry and mehitabel . It 's never clear in the story that it 's a roach the man turns into  --  just an insect . Waldo , do n't you have a collection of Kafka 's stories ? " " Take it , " Waldo ordered me when he had found it . " Take it away , do you hear ! " Instead of looking into it , however , Ursula and I got on the subject of sex . " Do n't you sleep with anybody beside your wife ? " she asked me at last . " No . " " Just what are you trying to prove ? " When she turned her back for a cigarette , I darted out the door and upstairs to my bedroom . I found I had the Kafka still in my hand . I lay down with my clothes on and read The Metamorphosis till I fell asleep . I dreamed that I was in the Hal Roach studios in Hollywood where a lot of people were throwing pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flying tins were sharply metallic , and quite dangerous . I awoke to a gay commotion beneath my window . Someone had turned the garden fountain on and in the moonlight Sweetie could be seen advancing toward it with soap and towel . I strode out the front door past the balustrade on which the marble figures lay in their cool sleep and down the stairsp134to the lawn . I shouldered past a pair of youths who were arguing about whether Hemingway was yellow , a larger group watching the Nude Bathing with shouts of laughter , and fetched up on the other side of the fountain where there were no spectators . " Sweetie , you 're coming home with me , " I stated through the splash of water . " I speak as your editor as well as your friend . You can do some fine things in the light verse field , but you 've got to get down out of there and dry yourself off first . " She made a face of comic surprise as she postured among the stone dolphins and the nymphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with herself . I turned my back , refusing to look . " Men are such pigs , " she said . She threw some water at me , and I edged out of range , where I stood with a foot on a white wrought-iron bench , waiting stoically  --  Pygmalion facingrevisions . The frolic was over in a moment and I heard her approaching across the grass behind me , toweling herself . " You know something ? " she said . " Ursula likes you . You can sleep with her if you want . " " No , thanks . " " Men can be such swine . Still think the human form is wicked ? " she taunted laughingly , belting up her own in any case in a terrycloth robe . I turned toward her . " Sweetie , if you knew what this is doing to your father . It 's killing him . He 's taken to his bed  --  sick at heart . " " Sick ! He 's on his way to France right this very minute to see about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , just to make sure everything is in order . He 's feeling no pain . Huh ! " We moved as by unspoken consent toward the Sound , ap135hundred yards away . I followed her gaze upward . All the bees of heaven swarmed . The fountain plash faded into the gentler monody of the waves , curling like white feathers along the beach toward which we tended . " Just what do you want of life ? " I asked rather largely . She answered so instantly she must have been going to blurt it out without being asked : " I want a child . " We negotiated a sudden drop in the genially graded lawn that gained us the beach . The sand looked so clean it might have been packaged and sent out from town , like farina . " Why , that 's fine , Sweetie . A very normal wish , " I said , helping her down . " Whom are you going to marry ? " " I did n't say I wanted a husband , I said I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chick , all thanks to you for getting me unknotted , to know that 's not for me . Or I 'm not for it  --  what 's the difference ? That 's simply not an involvement I 'd be good for , or at . But why should I go in for it ? Why ca n't a woman satisfy her maternal instinct without undertaking the institution society attaches as a condition ? Why really ? " " There 's no reason I suppose , intellectually speaking , " I said . " Still , a man around the house ... " " I 'll have money enough , so that 's not a factor . In fact , a man might wish to marry me for mine . " " Money , money , money ! Is that all I 'm to hear ? Legal Tender Is the Night ! " " I can be completely free about this . I 've thought about it for some time . Why run the risk of marriage if there 's no economicneed to ? Half of them fold , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . You know that . " " Do I ? " " So why should I miss out on the one experience I want now , for conventional reasons ? "  |p136We  strolled side by side along the beach , our feet whisperingiii the sand . Ephemeral liquid hands sifted the moon 's casual silver . " All right , let 's accept this Free Spirit theory of yours , " I said . " I know it 's been respectably put in many quarters , not the least a play of Shaw 's . But you 'd still have to choose a father for your child . How would you go about that ? " We paused for her to light a cigarette from a match in my cupped hands . She glanced at me , drawing on it . " That is a problem . Whom would you suggest ? " " Danny Dolan 's a fine sort , and seems to like you . " " Like me , he 's in love with me . That 's the trouble with that . Do n't go trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . And above all get the right slant on this . I do n't want a love child  --  I want a child I can love ! " You thought this a strange end to frivolity till , looking at her more closely , you realized it was the beginning of sobriety : the high purpose of one striking out for moral frontiers . " I 've refused to marry Danny a dozen times because I do n't want to get involved , and each time he gets more depressed . The last time he threatened  --  well , never mind that . The thing is he 's so bourgeois he 'd expect me to marry him because I was the mother of his child . So I 'd almost sooner it were a married man , just to keep it clean . Just to keep it objective . " She gave me another sidelong glance . " I 've even thought of you . " Oh , I think not , " I said . " Thanks just the same though . I 'm flattered . How about Dylan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only too willing . Your refusingshows a kind of character I 'd like my son to inherit . Or daughter . " " For the child really to have it to inherit I 'd have to pass up fathering it . How do we get around that ? " " No , seriously . It 's just the old l'homme moyen sensuel , manp137as a sensual means , that I 'm proposing . There 'd be nothing personal in it . " Romance on short notice . Isadora Duncan on the beach imploring a favor of her rescuer , and a child anonymously begottenon a warm Italian night . These waves plashed on a tame Westchester shore , endless little gasps of amazement . I looked up at the stars  --  consulted , always , as a gauge of the emotional temperature we were running . They had been rivets and bees , oats for Pegasus and intolerably twisted tuning pegs . From a radio came the strains of Charmaine , like scraps of silk fluttered on the spring night . We did n't know it , but just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tinted east over the Atlantic , the last ever seen or heard of it , and Sweeties only living relatives disappeared between two continents . The bulletins next day gave no time , but I often wonder if it was n't just then , as we stood together in our velvet night , that their motors plunged into the sea , churning the blood of the dawn . Sweetie sighed , stooping to fondle a stone . " Well , if you 're going to be stuffy I suppose it 'll have to be Danny . Because I suddenly feel time slipping . Every birthday is like a chill draft from a door somebody 's left open . Oh , Chick , " she cried in a whisper like the waves ' , and with that high dexterity of heart that was at long last hers , " I do so want a child ! " I did n't answer . Two figures in borrowed bathing suits were stumbling toward us over the sand . ' Flue first was Bill . " It 's Danny  --  " he exclaimed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their pallor was absolute  --  like that of cheesecake . " Somebody saw him go out on that damned rubber thing and then when nobody saw him again for an hour  --  Was he despondent ? " " What are you talking about ? " Sweetie faltered . Poor Danny . Had he been out of his depth all along with those companions ? Had the impossible yearning to Belong sent him to the horizon at last ? Had he been infected by thep138same lyric dream we were all in fear of flunking , that dream thanks to whose inherent irony it was best realized by being brought clown in a heap ? There had been a pneumatic horse in Tender Is the Night . Or had he been drunk on the vision of Gatsby bobbing , sad and laudable , on his inflated raft ? I turned toward the mansion behind one of whose uncountablewindows Waldo could be seen trying to give somebody something  --  liquidating our dream with all speed . As exponentof a militant provincialism I had only two allies  --  and one was mad and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Perhaps a little of both . " What makes you think  --  How do you  --  " Bill turned and pointed up the beach along whose receding rim the pure white plumes forever waved . " His horse came back without him , " the couriers panted in unison . My eyes turning upward sought the stars one last time . They looked to me like brass tacks.  |p139THERE  occurred an unexpected merger of my two problems . It was lucky or unlucky depending on how you looked at it . I had one of my charges on her feet . I was to see the other at our usual haunt after a call on Sweetie , who , alone now in the cottage on Beacon Street , was if anything more urgent in her desire for a child , a venture on which , under the sobering elms of home , I was by contrast the firmer in my resolve not to collaborate . " I 'm going to sell this place and move to New Mexico . I can write there . You 'll never see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I admire your spunk , but that 's as far as it goes . Good-by , Sweetie , and good luck . I 'll be watching for those poems . Good-by , good-by . " At the Greek 's there was the preliminary chat with Nickie before the stern periodic inventory . A book of prints he had with him prompted me to remark that a good artist can get more out of a minor subject than a poor one can get out of a major . " You 're absolutely right , " Nickie said . " Sargent gives us still lifes of people . Cezanne gives us portraits of apples . " " Cowplop . When are you going to nail the Smoothie ? Orp140Johnny Velours , as he now calls himself ? Three more jobs since the Flickendens ' and you 're still no closer to a solution . You realize you 're on a kind of probation . Your dream was validated in the sense that there is an adversary , but he 's makingmore of a fool of you than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how much longer I can keep her from Reno . You can , by getting a job . I 've been thinking . " I began my walk on eggs again . " Why do n't you work for a teaching certificate and then get a post at some first-rate university ? " He was lost in that dense thought into which it was so hard to pursue him . " I 've been thinking . It may not be Pete Cheshire at all . This looks like the work of a far more brilliant criminal . " " Two crooks in a town this size ? Oh , come now , is n't that asking too much of Providence ? Pete 's using the Johnny Velours name to throw suspicion off himself , but leaving it on a calling card with each job is clue enough . It 's Pete 's trade mark . Let 's not change the subject . Now I 've taken the liberty of getting some catalogues of normal colleges . . . Please take them . I insist ! " Nickie stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turning fish . " A college professor . Why not ? " he said with that ominous compliance I had learned to watch out for . He had readily agreed to " look into " real estate brokering by accompanyingan agent named Mrs. Apthorpe on her tours with clients . He was supposed to be exploring the possibilities of part-time employment but all it came to was some pleasant countryside rambles with a woman he found amusing , and a chance to see some local houses about which he had always been curious . " Why not indeed ? One is so many things , even at once . What is a man ? What is Man ? Oh , who am I ! " Camus and the problem of identity . Sartre and the blown leaves of self  --  the whole Existentialist express streaking through a night as black as the pit . I will try again , Lord . I willp141lie down between the tracks for yet this train to pass over me , its successive axles grazing the tip of my nose , no real damage let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the rather jolting circumstancesI 've intimated . I was leaning faintly against the wall of a building , in which position I had suffered a bootblack to nudge his apparatus meekly under one foot , when I noticed two backs that looked familiar . As they got into a cab I recognized Nickic and Sweetie Appleyard . When I swept into the vine-choked cottage the minute my work permitted it that afternoon , it was to find Sweetie under a sunlamp on the living room floor . The days were cloudy and she was trying to keep up with a tan she had begun . She lay on her stomach , gnawing a pencil , a notebook on the carpet . " How do you like this new poem ? " she said , turning over . " It 's called Taste , ' and listen , Chickic , because this is my first nonparody . Here 's Beth Appleyard on her own . " I stood modestly with my back turned while she read it aloud : If burlap typifies the taste That marks the common ilk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitute the silk . We drink espresso , we eat snails , We do not read for plot ; Preferring music classical We also like it hot . Many friends have fallen fromMy grace , as down a well , By playing me recorded Strauss , Or serving zinfandel.  |p142Thus  one by one they failed the test Of Sensibility , Leaving , in a world of clods , Him and you and me . But lately flaws in his facadeHave sometimes made me blench ; " Intriguing " is a word of his ; He laughs at fractured French ; His stories , though not shaggy dog , With subtle sickness fill me ; The temperatures at which he serves His vintage clarets chill me . By gradients often so minuteOffenders miss the bus . Oh , spirits rare are rare indeed ! It seems there 's only us . Together we  --  What 's that you say ? You 're fond of Duncan Phy f e ? You can stand Post-New Orleans jazz ? Lord , what a lonely life ! " Swell . See here , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swine , " your life is your own business and I realize the amorality of the artist . But leave Nickie Sherman alone ! " " Nickie who ? " " Sherman . You know who I mean . " " I 'm afraid I do n't . " " Stop lying  --  and get up . He 's a respectable married man , married to my sister is where I come in on this , and I 'll not have you getting your hooks into him and mucking up their already rickety life . An involvement like this might finish it . " She had slipped into shorts and a sweater , and now bent over a table to fish a cigarette out of a box.  | " I really do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Then who did I see you get into a cab with this afternoon ? " " Oh , him . Is that his name ? He was rather vague about it . He 's a nice chap I met in a bar . Very amusing . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has my number . " And I had hers . This girl 's purpose was firm . All the firmer must be mine : to protect my sister from infidelity by that lout . Nickie was weak and might be unable to extricate himself . I could . Nickie was a romantic who might follow her to the sands of Taos . I would n't . " All right , " I said with a sigh of resignation . " I 'll do what you ask . Provided one thing : you leave Nickie alone . Do you promise ? " " I do . " " Then I 'll keep my side of the bargain . When do you want to get this show on the road , as they say ? " " Tomorrow , Chickie ? There 's a lawyer coming in the morning to go over some things , but I 'll be home alone after two . How 's two o'clock ? Can we make it firm ? " " I should n't wonder , " I said , starting for the door . Lila asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show me . Nickie was out and the children were at day camp . Even that was n't enough secrecy . She bolted the door after admitting me and drew the living room blinds . She then disappeared to the rear of the apartment , returning with a small carton which she overturned on a table , spilling out a shower of jewelry . " What is all this ? " I asked , fingering some . She disentangled one of the pieces from the snarled mass of gems and gave it to me . " Recognize this ? " It was a gold bar pin monogrammed in the letter F with tiny green stones . I had seen a photograph of it in the paper.  | " Is n't that the emerald pin the Flickendens had stolen ? " I said . " And this must be that signet ring of the Babcocks ' , and this seed-pearl necklace fits the description of the one taken from the Mulhollands ' bedroom . Everything here tallies with something in the robbery lists . We 've kept clippings . There it is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Velours ! " Lila shook her head , her eyes closed . " Guess again . " " I simply do n't understand . Where did you find all this stuff ? " " Pockets of his clothes , drawers , hidden behind things on the closet shelf . I found this necklace when I was emptying a jacket of his for the cleaners , and kept looking for more . I really got suspicious when  --  " " Over how long a period ? " " Just this week . " " But I do n't understand . He recovers all this loot from Johnny Velours and still does n't turn him in , though the whole town 's laughing at him . It makes no sense . " " There 's one other explanation that does . " Lila drew a long breath and ran her palms down the sides of her hips . " He is Johnny Velours . " " Oh , come now , Lila , what are you talking about ? " " Something I 've been thinking over for days . It all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights more than before  --  afternoons were usually his time out  --  and acting rather mysteriously . There are gaps and discrepancies in the stories he tells mc . And it makes sense psychologically . " " How ? " " Turning the tables for that hoax . " She looked me hard in the eye . " Just think about it a minute . He 's the butt of a practicaljoke he ca n't take . What better revenge than to nip back to the Flickendens ' on the very same night and lift some ofp145their jewels while the revelry 's still going on downstairs ? Maybe on the way to the washroom . That 's not the end  --  making them laugh out of the other side of their mouths is n't enough . He 's smelled the excitement of crime and likes it . He goes out another night  --  " I turned around , running my fingers through my hair . " But the whole thing was supposed to be therapeutic  --  " "  --  and another night , to the homes of people he knows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your paper runs of vacationing citizens  --  most of them cards who had the first laugh , till he 's leading a career of crime . That 's my husband . A jewel thief ! " " You see , his ego needed some sort of appeasement , so havingfailed in one life he migrates to its opposite ; but not its opposite really , since it 's simply the other side of the same coin . He had got to put on the whole show himself . That make it clear to you , Sweets ? " She turned to the window , whirling away from me with a vehemence aimed at no other . I went over and laid a hand on her shoulder . " Now , Sis , you 're all wrought up ... " Wrought up ! Why should n't I be ? You 've made a burglar out of my husband ! " I nodded in diagnostic thought , totting up the factors in the case , now shown to be as grave as I 'd all along thought . " We have a detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crook succes , in a switch that bids fair to make my patient the most famous , I might say artistically tidy , case of dual personality in modern medicine . " " Yes , but you did n't cure it  --  you produced it ! " She whirled back . " If you mean that we purposely hastened the crisis we know to be inevitable in cases like this , yes , I accept that . But do n't get panicky . We induce these things now , just as obstetriciansp146induce labor . But it 's important for you not to tell Nickie you know . Let me handle it . The utmost delicacy is required . One misstep and we 're all in the bottom of the gorge . " " I ca n't go to Reno now , of course . This is too serious . I could n't leave him now . " " And to that extent we 've gained ground . I 'm proud of you , Sis . If it 'll help , Nickie 's is an exaggeration of a kind of split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls the Janus complex . We 're all two-faced . I-Iow many have the gumption to be two-headed ? " " Who is Van Kuykens ? " " A psychiatrist I 'm interested in . " " Shall we call him in ? " " He lives in Amsterdam . Please do n't get hysterical , but not that cold calm either . Something in between . I must find Nickie and have this out with him . Maybe he 's had enough of the cream of the jest to call it quits ; we 'll get the jewels anonymouslyto the police , and the whole thing will blow over . " The sound of a car stopping and footsteps outside sent me to the table where I scooped the mass of loot back into the carton . I popped it into a sideboard . The car drove off and the footsteps in the hall continued softly past the door and on up to an apartment overhead . " Now , sit tight till you hear from me , " I said . " I 'll go out and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he was now roaming about under two identities . He was n't in the Samothrace , nor any of a few bars and coffee shops I knew shared his favor . Then by chance I glanced into a barber shop I was passing and saw him sitting in the chair . I watched him from behind a newspaperkiosk outside . He had that curiously meek look men have when their hair is being cut . But when he emerged , in a neat gray pinstripe , his manner was jaunty.  | " Nickie ? " I said , popping from cover . He gave me a blank look and hurried on . " Nickie ? " I said , trotting abreast of him . " I 'm afraid you 've got me confused with someone else , old chap , " he said amiably . My knees melted as I recognized the look in his eyes that I remembered from the brief period when his wits had wanderedbefore . He did n't know he 'd been committing the crimes . " Of course . You 're Johnny Velours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name is Swallow , " I said , a word which meant nothing to him . " We met in a bar near here . " I indicated a tavern across the street . " How about a nooncr ? Or is it too early for you ? " " Not at all . Feel as though I could do with a spot of down-fall . " The conviction that he was Johnny Velours set well on Nickie . The caustic turn to which his manner had increasingly tended was softened . This island off the mainland of his psyche on which he had temporarily taken refuge , so to speak , was a warm , balmy place of easy tempo and gentle conversational breezes . He was a joy to talk to , to loaf over drinks with  --  I 'll say that for him . He was vague about what he did and where he lived , whether because he did n't know much about that , having only just assumed his alter ego , or out of intentional elusiveness , as Sweetie had implied . Needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . It was two o'clock before I remembered it , and that I was due there . I would call it off ; or simply drop the whole thing from my mind . Nickie required my full attention now . It was by way of granting it that my purposes were rudely shuttled back to the other . Nickie  --  or I should say Johnny Velours  --  fished in his pocket , and finding it barren of smallp148change , asked , " Oh , I say , could I borrow a dime ? I 've a call to make . " The faintly British note was in conformity to the tradition in which his present role was , after all , cast . The touch of Raffles roguishness in the way he went to the phone booth alerted me . I slipped over and listened behind it to the dial clicks . They corresponded well enough to the Appleyard number . When he returned I was seated at our table again , sipping . " Damn , " he said . " She claims she 's busy this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , " I said , with the sigh of one called sternly back to his obligations . For it was all now only too grimly plain . It had been obviouslyas Johnny Velours that he had made Sweetie 's acquaintance , therefore all the more urgent that I keep it from developing . The island must be re-integrated with the mainland before it acquired a sovereignty of its own , and a temporary fugue the dimensions of a complete split . Nickie needed time to resolve his conflict , Sweetie to wind up her affairs and be off for New Mexico and whatever D. H. Lawrence existence she had in mind for herself there ; meanwhile those two must be kept in strict quarantine from one another . Certainly he must be prevented from becoming a full-fledged principal in her flamboyant adventure . Nobody on earth could see to that but me . Such was the office I saw duty as squarely placing before me . So after picking up the check and bidding Johnny Velours good-by with the hope that we might meet here for a spot of downfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with a heavy heart set off in the direction of Sweetie Appleyard 's . " Come in ! " I heard her voice call from upstairs when I rapped the brass knocker . I did , closing the door quietly behind me . " Chick ? Come up . "  |p149She  awaited me on the landing with a smile . She had on , black toreador pants of the sort popular with the ladies that season , and was twirling a pair of horn-rimmed glasses which she explained , as I gained the final stair , she had just got for work and reading . She looked both more iconoclastic and more than ever a woman of the world who knew exactly what she wanted . I had the sense , that is to say , of an accredited revolutionaryhaving at last thoroughly supplanted the merely rebelliouschild . Only recently I could not have sworn to this certainty , seeing in her progress but the surface application of Kafka over Fitzgerald , and Proust over both ; like one wallpaper over another . ( She was reading avidly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) For our private developmentis all too often a matter of mechanical stages for which there is as yet no corresponding enrichment of the spiritual soil . Just as in those commercial billboards on which , on wet days , underlying previous advertisements can be seen " bleeding " through , so that mingled with representations of married couples being conversationally stimulated by their choice of morning paper can be discerned a genial grandmother pressing a chest remedy on a bedridden child , while a phantom rivetworkersmoking Camels haunts them both , just so I could catch , through the surface layer of Sweetie 's new sophisticated self , glimpses and echoes of that wayward girl the new self had not quite yet replaced but merely overlaid ; while closer scrutiny revealed that first avatar in which our odyssey in time had begun : the moppet tearing among the summer trees . Now all that was different . I saw a mature woman whose work was going well and who had a firm grasp of her purposes . So molecular , however , are the processes of growth that no word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too slight to bear its print . Just as the enamored hero of The Guermantes Way could trace Albertine 's transformation since last seen by the most trivial additions to her vocabulary , so that her mere usep150of the phrase " to my mind "  --  in an observation itself of no moment  --  was sufficiently a gauge of burgeoning womanhood for him to assure us that on hearing it " I drew Albertine towards me , and at I regard ' made her sit on the side of my bed , " so I detected in Sweetie 's laughing allusion to herself as " ConstantWriter " an aspect of balanced self-derision , and in her " Bet you like me behind this windshield , yuk , yuk , " the grain of true worldliness . Through an open door I saw a bed strewn with writing materials , under a burning sunlamp . " You look as though you need a drink . " I followed her downstairs , swinging my still undisposed of hat . " Before we begin , there are a few things I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure whether you 've thought this thing through from every angle . Supposing  --  " " Oh , stop supposing , " she laughed , taking my hat , which she hooked insecurely on a hall peg , so that I had to stoop and recoverit . " The lawyer just left and the financial picture is even better than I 'd thought . And guess what  --  Father named you my guardian in his will . " " In that case , " I said , stiffening in a sudden access of opinion , " I must advise you against this whole business and withdrawfrom any further participation in it . " " Oh , do n't be childish . The whole guardian idea is senseless anyway since I 'm of age . It was just a gesture on his part . Pour us drinks . Give me any old thing . I want you to listen to a poem I 've been sweating over . " " All . Let 's hear it . " She dropped into a chair with a page of manuscript . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as thinking about for a long time . It 's the theme of the artist versus society . Talent in conflict with the conventional mold . I only have the first stanza finished , but here it is :  |p151Coleridge  caused his wife unrest , Liking other company best . Dickens , never quite enthralled , Sent his packing when she palled . Gauguin broke the marriage vow In quest of Paradise enow . These things attest in monochrome : Genius is the scourge of home . " I 'll go on from there to other examples , you see . Byron , Wagner , Shelley , all impossible . Then to get around to the women : George Sand , Isadora Duncan , Edith Wharton , and so on . I thought maybe you could help me with some . Who are some other geniuses whose dish of tea home life was n't ? " " Well , I was just thinking about Bach , " I said , handing her a highball . " Loyal not only to one wife but two , with twenty children all told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there 's Mark Twain , Thomas Mann , Conan Doyle who adored his family ... " " You 're pulling my leg . " " No , you 're pulling your own . I think it 's wishful thinking , this idea you artistic types hug , that you ca n't be one of the folks . It 's a self-justification , a kind of goofing off . Why take pride in being a lousy human being , for Christ 's sake ? " She watched me owlishly over her glass as I gestured with mine . " Take Camus . He lives quietly with his wife in Paris . They seem to be making a go of it . Lovely slaughter  --  " " Oh , for Pete 's sake , Chick , stop talking like an idiot . Making a go of it ' ! Really ! " " The E. E. Cummings ' are making a go of it . " " If you say that one more time I 'll scream . Of course there are exceptions . I 'm talking about by and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd hate to have been her ... "  |p152We  went at it hammer and tongs for half an hour or more , drinking steadily . The debate raged as we disrobed upstairs . " hold on there , this average man you keep talking about , " I said , gesturing with a shoe , " I want him defined . " " Oh , defined ! You talk like somebody on a high-school debatingteam . " " Thank you . " An absurd domesticity enveloped the scene as we quarreled together in the upstairs bedroom . " Eliot is a churchwarden , " I said , my voice hoarse with passion . " So ? " " He married his secretary . It 's straight out of Hollywood , woman ! " I had to check my desire for Sweetie as I climbed , yelling , into the bed she had cleared of writing junk . This must be kept objective , a purely functional passion . " I still think you 're making a mistake , " I said , slipping between the sheets . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is ill-advised . However . " She switched off the sunlamp and a reading light over her pillow . " How pale you are , " she said , settling beside me . " You ought to try one of these ultra-violet lamps . Do you realize I even feel better after using it ? Probably psychological , but what 's the difference . " " You 're quite right . Tell me , how much do they cost ? " She looked up at it . " I really could n't say . We seem to always have had one around . Anyhoo . " She remolded her pillowsomewhat . " You know , Chick , you have nice shoulders . " " So do you . And your skin . It 's that soft brown in which French provincial furniture is , for the most part , finished . " I was aware in a drowsy haze of Sweetie rising and drawing on her blouse and toreador pants . I had dropped off . I watchedP153with one eye as she buttoned her clothing and combed her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She came quietly back to the bed . " Take forty winks for yourself while I fix us some coffee , " she said , a faint smile discernible in her murmur . " Here , get yourself a load of the sunlamp if you 'd like . " She switched it on and adjusted it over my head , tucking the sheet down off my shoulder . " Feel good ? Not more than a few minutes the first time , mind , or him will burn . Did you hear Sweetie ? " I nodded , smiling as I snoozed away again . The warmth of the lamp did feel good . I had a sense of delicious lassitude as I sank into oblivion with the sound of her footsteps fading down the carpeted stair .. . I awoke from a dream of being quizzed at police headquarters . Blinking , I pushed the glaring light away and sat up . One side of my face itched quite a bit . When I pressed a palm to it my hand felt hot . A dresser clock said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my clothes , hearing Sweetie 's voice downstairs . It was the drone of someone on the telephone . Twisting into my shirt I caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror . My right cheek and shoulder were a glowing pink . Sweetie hung up and met me as I hurried into the living room . " That was Valerie Lewis . Trying to get her to sign off  --  Lord , Chick , look at you . " " I already have . " I stood buttoning a shirt cuff . " What 's the idea , leaving a man under there like a chicken under a broiler while you gab away with your women friends ? " " I 'm sorry , darling , but I told you only a few minutes at first  --  " " How am I going to explain this at home ? Or the office for that matter ? Come on , help me think of an alibi . Where could a working man spend an afternoon that would also reasonably explain his face being cooked to a crisp ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . " First let 's put something on it . " She flew to the bathroom , returning with a jar of vaseline as I was getting into my coat . " It 's too late for that now , " I said . " And what good will it do to look sauteedon top of it ? " " But , darling , it could be serious . Who was that actor who fell asleep under one and had to be rushed to the  --  " " I told you this would lead to no good . But no , you needed a man to assert your independence of men with , big deal . I 'm not denying the intellectual validity of varied and possibly interlockingcauses  --  " I could not make out what else I said as the door slammed behind me and I ran down the porch stairs to my car . I shot up Beacon for four blocks and turned left on Chestnut , one side of me red hot and the other stone cold . I slammed to a stop before a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , or , more accurately , analyzed the logical imperatives under which I labored . The only account of my appearance that would hold water would be for me to have a sunlamp too . I would have to take the sunlamp up . The drugstore was Hickett 's . I was surprised to find Mr. Hickett still alive and in there , years having elapsed since we had plagued him with superb dialogue and learned allusions at the soda fountain . I was at least grateful no one else was . Keeping in stern profile , like a figure in a Babylonian frieze , I said with some urgency , " Have you got a sunlamp ? " Sunlamp ? " " Yes , you know  --  those ultraviolet things . I need one right away . Out of the tail of my eye I was aware of him appraising my own radiation . His mustache had whitened , his hair thinned , his general appearance grown more motheaten ; he had on the same gray suit he had worn for perhaps half a century and would no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever , so that when he kept circling to get a view of my incandescent side and I swiveled as steadily to keep it hidden , the choreography was weird indeed . " No , we do n't , " he said . " But we have those sun bulbs . Just the bulb , that you can stick in any ordinary socket . " " Will they do the trick ? " " Trick ? " " Yes . Give you a sunburn . Or tan , rather . " Mr. Hickett had edged out from behind the counter in his determination to get a look at the fried side of my face , and his elbow brushed a display card of combs , knocking it down . I turned involuntarily toward it as it tumbled to the floor , giving him a fleeting but decisive glimpse of what he wanted to see . " Do you need it right away ? " he asked , paling slightly himself . " That 's what I said . The bulb , please . " " But  --  " He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in midair as his hand fell away . " Will you please give me one of those things ? I'iiz in a hurry ! " He swallowed his eyeballs . I had not witnessed this agonized rigmarole for a decade or more  --  indeed I had forgotten that feature of my student days  --  and its enactment struck me with fresh impact . Mr. Hickett 's pupils seemed to bulge as they disappeared from view under his fluttering lids , while his mouth worked in a grimace of their own . He plucked a cubeshapedcarton from under the counter while with the other hand he drew a yard of wrapping paper from a roll . " Never mind that , " I said , taking the box from him . " How much is it ? " " Nine fifty . " Standing laterally , I fished a ten-dollar bill from my wallet and gave it to him . He turned to the cash register to make change in a deliberate manner . " Do you want to match thep156other side of your face with it ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't see that that 's any concern of yours . I asked whether this bulb would do the trick and you have n't answeredmy question . " " It 's not as good as a regular sunlamp but it 's ultraviolet . It 's five hundred watts . I had a woman get third-degree burns with one the other day . Will that do ? " " That will be fine , " I said , taking the fifty-cent piece , and hurried sideways out of the store . So far so good . I sped toward the Pick office in a sudden shower , perfecting my plan of action and occasionally glancing at myself in the rear-view mirror . There was no doubt I had sustained a severe bum . Its color was deepening momentarily ; by evening I would resemble a boiled lobster . Halfway to the office I suddenly stopped at the curb . I tapped the steering wheel in thought . My wife was attending a committee meeting for some kind of women 's club symposiumthat afternoon . Did that change the picture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to sneak into the house with my purchase , so that when she returned I might be found lying under it , home from the office early with a cold , which I was doctoring in this fashion , and with an imprudent first exposure , etc . It was foolproof . I phoned the office from a street booth , and over Miss McConkey 's spluttered spate of messages and queries about where the devil had I been , most of them in the name of Bulwinkle , said , " I 'm sick . Put off my appointments till tomorrow or the next day , " and hurried home . My heart sank at the sight of ten cars in my driveway . The women were meeting at our house . Well , no matter . I must go on with the plan , feeling my way and extemporizing around any possible obstacles . If I was seen entering with my purchaseunder my arm I would say that I had overdosed myselfp157with it on my office couch , which had been my original idea anyway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage , then stole round in the rain to the back yard . The damnable Blitzsteinset up a loud barking , which I squelched by pausing to pet him and to enact the march around the pole which freed his tie-out chain . Shifting the parcel under my arm , I tiptoed to the house and listened under a dining room window . A gabble of voices mingled with the clatter of tea crockery told me the women were hard at it . This would be a cinch . I crept unheard into the front door and up the inside stairs to our bedroom . Working quietly as a thief , I unscrewed the bulb from the reading lamp over my side of the bed and screwed in the ultra-violet , which I snapped on . Then I removed my shoes and coat and stretched out on the bed , at peace , except for the urge to scratch my now fiercely itching face . I kept that well out of the rays of the lamp , until such time as Crystal walked into the bedroom . When I heard her footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow to be in the clear . After about ten minutes the buzz of voices rose to the shrill clamor of adjournment . Five more and they were all out . PresentlyCrystal 's tread was heard approaching up the hall . I put my head , cooked side up , under the light . She entered . " Well , where on earth  --  " " Oh , hello , dear . " I stirred as from a sleep , blinking . " What time is it ? Oh , my goodness , how long have I been lying here under this  --  My face  --  look at it ! " Crystal came round the foot of the bed . There were six or seven different expressions on her face . " When in God 's name did you get home ? What are you  --  When  --  The office has been calling since ten o'clock this morning . " " Oh , I 've been here for some time . Hour maybe . I was feel/ing punk but I did n't want to disturb you , so I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and another , and this character at the office has been talking up sunlamps so long that I thought I 'd give it a whirl . Well so . How did the meetinggo ? " " But I came up here for something just a while ago and I did n't see you . " " Well , perhaps I was asleep . " " God , look at you ! " " I know . Shall we call the doctor ? " I said , my anxiety shifting to that quarter . Flaming pain and unappeasable pruriencemingled in my cheek , which I now clawed in a voluptuousfrenzy . " Is there something we can do till he comes ? " " Wait a minute . Agnes Howe had that and there was only one simple thing of any use . What was it ? " Crystal snapped her fingers in the effort to recall . " Cold cream . " She darted into the bathroom from which she instantly emerged with a jar of it . A bell rang as she twisted off its cap . Round that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that often appear in cycles of passion or distress , and that satisfy the taste for cheap symbolism . It is said to hound lunatics and criminals , as well as those in comparable extremities . Or perhaps these repetitions occur constantly in daily life but are only noticed in the heightened awareness that accompanies emotional strain . At any rate , I recognized the blue crock of skin cream for which Crystal had come into the bathroom on the evening when , sitting in the tub , I had heard the name of the sitter which touched off all these events . " Where were you earlier though ? " she asked as she spread it gently on my cheek . " Miss McConkey phoned before lunch and then after , in a perfect  --  " " I was busy with Nickie . You have n't been in touch with Lila , I take it . Well then , I 'd better tell you what 's going on . I think that 'll do . Thanks , darling . Here , sit down on the bedp159while we forget about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a very pretty story . " " Just let me get this part here . It seems to go down your neck and  --  " " She call me Dr. Swallow ? Hey ? Miss McConkey call me that ? I have to laugh at her . " " Loosen your collar . . . That 's better . It seems to go clear down  --  For heaven 's sake , your whole shoulder and back are burned . I thought you had your shirt on when I came in just now. , ,  |p160NICKIE  'S intervals on the island  --  to continue viewing him in that light  --  became more frequent and prolonged . Not , fortunately , that each assumption of the Johnny Velours identityentailed a fresh theft . There was only one new burglary in the next few weeks , that of a Jackson Pollock from the twentyroomBurwash place , thought impregnable by virtue of an alarm system which the police had considered foolproof . That , perhaps more than the literate nature of the heist , was the clincher to me that it was Nickie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been familiar with the installation . Which in no way lessened the wonder of his beating it . Flow had he brought the coup off ? And he was a joy as a person . An errant charm , with no more Continental hand-munching than you could stand , made him quite the ladies ' man . Lila fell in love with him all over again , if I should n't rather put it that she was now tempted to her first disloyalty to her husband on his account . I took her into a bar to meet him one day . Because when his vagueness about placing her became at last a total blank , I suggested she accept the challenge innate in the situation and cultivate him in his new guise . She looked pretty in a blue tweed and matching hat over cropped curls , and when I left them hitting it off in ap161twilit booth I sensed that I had made a fine match . My mother ' was luckily still on hand to take the children in this crisis as she had the last , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plan of procedure . With her entrenched on both island and mainland , we stood a much better chance of integrating Nickums . Of pulling Nickums together . And by George if he did n't fall in love with her . " He 's asked me to marry him , " Lila told me . " I 'm so happy for you . " " he 's promised to go straight . " A development like this becomes more credible when it is remembered that the separate elements in a split arc subterraneouslylinked . Somewhere underwater the island is connected with the mainland , if only unconsciously . ' lucre was a further bond , that between Nickie and me in a mutual past . Johnny Velours had his roots deep in a character in a play Nickie and I had written years before . I recognized some of the mannerisms and even a phrase or two thrown out by a nimble persifleur drawing freely on the old clays . Our county , for instance , abounds in authors of novels suitable for conversioninto movies . Johnny Velours called them writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him wholly delightful . He listened too . Nor did he seize proprietorship of your ideas in mid-statement for more adroit dilation than your own , like that awful Nickie Sherman . " By all means marry him , " I told Lila . " I certainly prefer him as a brother-in-law . The thing has my blessing . " " Would n't that be bigamy ? " " I doubt it in this case , but I 'll look it up . I know there are problems . There 's the children . But I 'll bet one thing . When you spring them on Johnny , he wo n't back out . There 's that gallantry about him . Another hunch I have is that the thefts are over , or at least tapering off . They 've satisfied what in his emotions had to be satisfied . And your marrying him will arrestp162Johnny Velours , so to speak , before the cops can . For Pete 's sake do n't let him get away ! " All this  --  the plan to reverse our thinking and absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than organize Nickie Sherman  --  might have worked , had it not been for a development from a totally unexpected quarter . Pete Cheshire had been all this time the chief suspect , of course , and was periodically hauled in for grilling . Each time he managed to clear himself  --  no surprise to us under the circumstances . Then when the papers were full of the Jackson Pollock job and its sparkling execution , Pete suddenly changed his tune . He stepped forward and claimed authorship of it . There he was in the morning paper , grinning vainly between two cops . I dashed over to my sister 's the minute I saw it . " Did you see the paper ? " I said . " Yes . What do you make of it ? " " It 's hard to tell . But it 's obviously one of those crank confessions . ' He could n't resist getting out there to take those bows . " I could hear someone moving about in the rear of the house , a man 's footsteps . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? " " We 'll see when he comes in . " Seated , Lila pruned a window fern of dead leaves . " He ferries between that island of yours and the mainland so often that I never know from one minute to the next who I 'm up against . Did you know they 're now calling you King Solomon ? " The acceleration and contraction of the cycles indicated a struggle , perhaps an approaching climax . They were fighting for the mastery , that pair . Nickie knew it better than Johnny ; he had finally discussed it freely with me in his more limpid hours as himself . Here was a battle of wits for you : a man trying to catch and elude himself simultaneously , sleuth and male/factor in one . Oh , he had got to put on the whole show himself , all right . Well might he ask as he had , " Who am I ! " " Either way , I ca n't lose , " Nickie had observed to me the day before , when pride in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " Or win , " I 'd added , and he had nodded . " Yes , we shall see who 's the cleverer . I  --  or Me . " The footsteps in the kitchen came down the hall , through the dining room and into the living room where we sat waiting . There was no doubt who strolled in , the way our faces fell . Prud'homme waddled in his wake . " Hello , Nickie . " " Hello , Chick . " He stood there buttoning a shirt cuff . " You look a bit chewed up . What 's the matter ? " " Maybe it 's the worries I take to bed with me . " I made a few remarks polished in advance on the subject , as a safeguard against being topped . It was actually a Proustian fragment left over from the Mme. Piquepuss clays , which seemed halcyon by comparison now . " Slumber , as everyone who has suffered nervous ordeals knows , is no guarantee of refreshment . His henchman , bad dreams , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . Eight hours of oblivionmay be devoted by good spirits to the renewal of vitality , or by bad to a depletion compatible with , or even desired by , our subconscious . " " Yes . Nature gives us the gift of sleep . The rest is up to us . " Cowplop . Well , have you heard about Cheshire ? " " Yes . I was just on my way down to headquarters . I ca n't let him take the rap for those burglaries , you know . It would be comic if it were n't so pathetic . The poor fool does n't even know who Jackson Pollock is . " It was the credit , of course , not the rap he could n't let **26;700;TOOLONG was a long pause . " Come again ? I did n't catch the name . " " Culligan , " I said . " Peter Culligan . " " What about him ? " " Did you ever know him ? " " Maybe I did , a long time ago . So what ? Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Matheson . I have some information , if you 're interested . " " I 'm not . Not if you 're talking for Pete Culligan . " Her voice had become harsher and deeper . " I do n't care anything about him , as long as he leaves me alone . You can tell him that for me . " " I ca n't , though . " " Why not ? " " Because he 's dead . " " Dead ? " Her voice was a leaden echo . " I 'm investigating his murder . " I 'd just decided I was . " I 'd like to talk to you about the circumstances . " " I do n't see why . I had nothing to do with it . I did n't even know it happened . " " I 'm aware of that . It 's one reason I called . " " Who killed him ? " " I 'll tell you when I see you . " " Who says you 're seeing me ? " I waited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the San Francisco Airport . " " I guess I can come there , if it has to be . I do n't want you coming to the house . My husband  --  " " I understand that . It 's good of you to come at all . I 'll be in the coffee shop . " " Are you in uniform ? " " Not at the moment . " Or for the last ten years , but let her go on thinking I was law . " I 'm wearing a gray suit . Youp51wo n't miss me . I 'll be sitting beside the windows close to the entrance . " " I 'll be there in fifteen minutes . Did you say Archer ? " " Yes . Archer . " It took her twenty-five . I passed the time watching the big planes circling in , dragging their late-afternoon shadows along the runways . A woman in a dark cloth coat came in , paused at the doorway , and looked around the huge room . Her eye lighted on me . She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was a token of respectability . I got up to meet her : " Mrs. Matheson ? " She nodded , and sat down hurriedly , as if she was afraid of being conspicuous . She was an ordinary-looking woman , decently dressed , who would never see forty again . There were flecks of gray in her carefully waved black hair , like little shards of iron . She had once been handsome in a strong-boned way . Maybe she still was , under favorable lighting and circumstances . Her black eyes were her best feature , but they were hard with tension : " I did n't want to come . But here I am . " " Will you have some coffee ? " " No , thanks . Let 's have the bad news . I 'll take it straight . " I gave it to her straight , leaving out nothing important . She began to twist the wedding ring on her finger , round and round . " Poor guy , " she said when I finished . " Why did they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was hoping you could help me answer that . " " You say you 're not a policeman ? " " No . I 'm a private investigator . " " I do n't see why you come to me . We have n't been mar/Tied for fifteen years . I have n't even seen him for ten . He wanted to come back to me , I guess he finally got tired of bucketing around . But I was n't having any . I 'm happily married to a good man  --  " " When was the last time you heard from Culligan ? " " About , a year ago . He wrote me a letter from Reno , claimed he 'd struck it rich , that he could give me anything I wanted if I 'd come back . Pete was always a dreamer . The first while after we were married , I used to believe in his dreams . But they all went blooey , one after another . I caught onto him so many years ago it is n't funny . I 'm not laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dream ? " " Great big ones , the kind that never come off . Like he was going to open a chain of restaurants where food of all nationswould be served . He 'd hire the best chefs in the country , French , Chinese , Armenian , and so on . At which time he was a short-order cook on lower Market . Then there was the time he worked out a new system to beat the ponies . He took every cent we possessed to try it out . He even hocked my furniture . It took me all that winter to work it off . " Her voice had the driving energy of old anger that had found an outlet . " That was Pete 's idea of a honeymoon , me working and him playing the ponies . " " How did you get hooked up with him ? " " I was a dreamer , too , I guess you 'd say . I thought I could straighten him out , make a man of him . That all he needed was the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , and I do n't pretend to be . But I was better than he was . " " Where did you meet ? " " In the San Francisco Hospital where I was working . I was a nurse 's aide , and Pete was in the ward with a broken nose and a couple of broken ribs . He got beaten up in a gang fight . " 53 " A gang fight ? " " That 's all I know . Pete just said it was some rumble on the docks . I should have taken warning , but after he got out of the hospital I went on seeing him . He was young and good-looking , and like I said I thought he had the makings of a man . So I married him  --  the big mistake of my life , and I 've made some doozies . " " How long ago was that ? " " Nineteen-thirty-six . That dates me , does n't it ? But I was only twenty-one at the time . " She paused , and raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 'm telling you all this . I 've never told a living soul in my life . Why do n't you stop me ? " " I 'm hoping you 'll tell me something that will help . Did your husband go in for gambling ? " " Please do n't call him that . I married Pete Culligan , but he was no husband to me . " She lifted her head . " I have a real husband now . Incidentally , he 'll be expecting me back to make his dinner . " She leaned forward in her chair and started to get up . " Ca n't you give me a few minutes more , Mrs. Matheson ? I 've told you all I know about Peter  --  " She laughed shortly . " If I told you all I know , it would take all night . Okay , a few more minutes , if you promise me there wo n't be any publicity . My husband and me have a position to keep up . I 'm a member of the PTA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be any publicity . Was he a gambler ? " " As much as he could afford to be . But he was always small-time . " " This money he said he made in Reno  --  did he tell you how he made it ? " " Not a word . But I do n't think it was gambling . He was never that lucky . " " Do you still have his letter ? "  | " Certainly not . I burned it , the same day I got it . " " Why ? " " Because I did n't want it around the house . I felt like it was dirt tracked into the house . " " Was Culligan a crook , or a hustler ? " " Depends what you mean by that . " Her eyes were wary . " Did he break the law ? " " I guess everybody does from time to time . " " Was he ever arrested ? " " Yeah . Mostly for drunk and disorderly , nothing serious . " " Did he carry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't let him . " " But the issue came up ? " " I did n't say that . " She was becoming evasive . " I meant I would n't let him even if he wanted to . " " Did he own a gun ? " " I would n't know , " she said . I 'd almost lost her . She was n't talking frankly or willingly any more . So I threw her the question I did n't expect her to answer , hoping to gather something from her reaction to it : " You mentioned an L. Bay in your letter to Culligan . What happened there ? " Her lips were pushed out stiff and pale , as if they were made of bone . The dark eyes seemed to shrink in her head : " I do n't know what makes you ask that . " The tip of her tongue moved along her upper lip , and she tried again : " What was that about a bay in my letter ? I do n't remember any bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matheson . " I quoted : " I could make trouble for you , double trouble . Remember L. Bay . ' " " If I said that , I do n't know what I meant . " " There 's a place called Luna Bay about twenty-five or thirty miles from here . " " Is there ? " she said stupidly . " You know it . What did Pete Culligan do there ? "  | " I do n't remember . It must have been some dirty trick he played on me . " She was a poor liar , as most honest people are . " Does it matter ? " " It seems to matter to you . Did you and Pete live in Luna Bay ? " " I guess you could call it living . I had a job there , doing practical nursing . " " When ? " " Way back when . I do n't remember what year . " " Who were you working for ? " " Some people . I do n't remember their name . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have that letter with you ? " " I left it where I found it , in Culligan 's suitcase in the house where he worked . Why ? " " I want it back . I wrote it , and it belongs to me . " " You may have to take that up with the police . It 's probably in their hands by now . " " Will they be coming here ? " She looked behind her , and all around the crowded restaurant , as if she expected to find a policeman bearing down on her . " It depends on how soon they catch the killer . They may have him already , in which case they wo n't bother with secondary leads . Do you have any idea who it was , Mrs. Matheson ? " " How could I ? I have n't seen Pete in ten years , I told you . " " What happened in Luna Bay ? " " Change the record , ca n't you ? If anything happened , which I ca n't remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with anybody else , understand ? " Her voice and looks were altering under pressure . She seemed to have broken through into a lower stratum of experienceand a coarser personality . And she knew it . She pulled her purse toward her and held on to it with both hands . It was a good purse , beautifully cut from genuinep56lizard . In contrast with it , her hands were rough , their knuckles swollen and cracked by years of work . She raised her eyes to mine . I caught the red reflection of fear in their centers . She was afraid of me , and she was afraid to leave me . " Mrs. Matheson , Peter Culligan was murdered today  --  " " You expect me to go into mourning ? " " I expect you to give me any information that might have a bearing on his death . " " I already did . You can leave me alone , understand ? You 're not getting me mixed up in no murder . Any murder . " " Did you ever hear of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John Brown ? " " No . " I could see the bitter forces of her will gathering in her face . She exerted them , and got up , and walked away from me and her fear . I WENT back to the telephone booths and looked up the name Chad Bolling in the Bay Area directories . I did n't expect to find it , after more than twenty years , but I was still running in luck . Bolling had a TelegraphHill address . I immured myself in one of the booths and called him . A woman 's voice answered : " This is the Bolling resi-dence . " " Is Mr. Bolling available ? "  | " Available for what ? " she said abruptly . " It has to do with magazine publication of a poem . The name is Archer , " I added , trying to sound like a wealthy editor . " I see . " She softened her tone . " I do n't know where Chad is at the moment . And I 'm afraid he wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The Listening Ear later this eve-ning . " " The Listening Ear ? " " It 's a new night club . Chad 's giving a reading there tonight . If you 're interested in poetry , you owe it to yourself to catch it . " " What time does he go on ? " " I think ten . " I rented a car and drove it up Bayshore to the city , where I parked it under Union Square . Above the lighted towers of the hotels , twilight had thickened into darkness . A damp chill had risen from the sea ; I could feel it through my clothes . Even the colored lights around the square had a chilly look . I bought a pint of whisky to ward off the chill and checked in at the Salisbury , a small side-street hotel where I usually stayed in San Francisco . The desk clerk was new to me . Desk clerks are always moving up or down . This one was old and on his way down ; his sallow face drooped the pull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No luggage , sir ? " I showed him my bottle in its paper bag . He did n't smile . " My car was stolen . " " That 's too bad . " His eyes were sharp and incredulous behindfussy little pince-nez . " I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask you to pay in advance . " " All right . " I gave him the five dollars and asked for a receipt . The bellhop who took me up in the old open ironwork ele/vator had been taking me up in the same elevator for nearly twenty years . We shook hands . His was crumpled by arthritis. " flow are you , Coney ? " " Fine , Mr. Archer , fine . I 'm taking a new pill , phenylbuta-something . It 's doing wonders for me . " He stepped out and did a little soft-shoe step to prove it . He 'd once been half of a brother act that played the Orpheumcircuit . He danced me down the corridor to the door of my room . " What brings you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inside . To San Franciscans , there 's only one city . " I flew up for a little entertainment . " " I thought Hollywood was the world 's center of entertain-ment . " " I 'm looking for something different , " I said . " Have you heard of a new club called The Listening Ear ? " " Yeah , but you would n't like it . " He shook his white head . " I hope you did n't come all the way up here for that . " " What 's the matter with it ? " " It 's a culture cave . One of these bistros where guys read poems to music . It ai n't your speed at all . " " My taste is becoming more elevated . " His grin showed all his remaining teeth . " Do n't kid an old man , eh ? " " Ever hear of Chad Bolling ? " " Sure . He promotes a lot of publicity for himself . " Coney looked at me anxiously . " You really going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have long yearned for the finer things . " Such as a good French dinner at a price I could pay . I took a taxi to the Ritz Poodle Dog , and had a good French dinner . When I finished eating , it was nearly ten o'clock . The Listening Ear was full of dark blue light and pale blue music . A combo made up of piano , bass fiddle , trumpet ,  |p59and  drums was playing something advanced . I did n't have my slide rule with me , but the four musicians seemed to understand each other . From time to time they smiled and nodded like space jockeys passing in the night . The man at the piano seemed to be the head technician . He smiled more distantly than the others , and when the melody had been done to death , he took the applause with more exquisite remoteness . Then he bent over his keyboard again like a mad scientist . The tight-hipped waitress who brought my whisky-andwaterwas interchangeable with nightclub girls anywhere . Even her parts looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds . Most of them were young people with serious expressions on their faces . A high proportion of the girls had short straight hair through which they ran their fingers from time to time . Many of the boys had longer hair than the girls , but they did n't run their fingers through it so much . They stroked their beards instead . Another tune failed to survive the operation , and then the lights went up . A frail-looking middle-aged man in a dark suit sidled through the blue curtains at the rear of the room . The pianist extended his hand and assisted him onto the bandstand . The audience applauded . The frail-looking man , by way of a bow , allowed his chin to subside on the big black bow tie which blossomed on his shirt front . The applauserose to a crescendo . " I give you Mr. Chad Bolling , " the pianist said . " Master of all the arts , singer of songs to be sung , painter of pictures , hepcat , man of letters . Mr. Chad Bolling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet lifted his hand as if in benediction , and there was silence . " Thank you , friends , " he said . " With the support of my brilliant young friend Fingers Donahue , I wish to bring to you tonight , if my larynx will permit , my latest poem . " Hisp6omouth twisted sideways as if in self-mockery . " It ai n't chopped liver . " lie paused . The instruments began to murmur behind him . Bolling took a roll of manuscript out of his inside breast pocket and unrolled it under the light . " Death Is Tabu , ' " he said , and began to chant in a hoarse carrying voice that reminded me of a carnival spieler . He said that at the end of the night he sat in wino alley where the angels drink canned heat , and that he heard a beat . It seemed a girl came to the mouth of the alley and asked him what he was doing in death valley . " Death is the ultimate crutch , ' she said , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . He said that sex was the ultimate crutch , but he turned out to be wrong . It seemed he heard a gong . She fled like a ghost , and he was lost , at the end of the end of the night . While the drummer and the bass fiddler made shock waves on the roof , Bolling raised his voice and began to belt it out . About how he followed her up and down and around and underground , up Russian Hill and Nob Hill and TelegraphHill and across the Bay Bridge and back by way of the Oakland ferry . So he found the sphinx on Market Street cadging drinks and they got tight and danced on the golden asphalt of delight . Eventually she fell upon her bed . " I 'm star-transfixed , " she said . He drank the canned hell of her lips , and it went on like that for quite a while , while the music tittered and moaned . She finally succeeded in convincing him that death was the ultimate crutch , whatever that meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good night , mister , " she said , or he said she said . " Good night , sister , " he said . The audience waited to make sure that Bolling was finished , then burst into a surge of clapping , interspersed with bravos and ole 's . Bolling stood with pursed lips and ab/sorbed it like a little boy sucking soda pop through a straw . While the lower part of his face seemed to be enjoying itself , his eyes were puzzled . His mouth stretched in a clownish grin : " Thanks , cats . I 'm glad you dig me . Now dig this . " He read a poem about the seven blind staggers of the soul , and one about the beardless wonders on the psycho wards who were going to be the gurus of the new truth . At this point I switched off my hearing aid , and waited for it to be over . It took a long time . After the reading there were books to be autographed , questions to be answered , drinks to be drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admirersand made for the door . I got up to follow him . A large girl with a very hungry face cut in in front of me . She attachedherself to Bolling 's arm and began to talk into his ear , bending over because she was taller than he was . He shook his head . " Sorry , kiddie , I 'm a married man . Also I 'm old enough to be your father . " " What are years ? " she said . " A woman 's wisdom is age-less . " " Let 's see you prove it , honey . " He shook her loose . Tragically clutching the front of her baggy black sweater , she said : " I 'm not pretty , am I ? " " You 're beautiful , honey . The Greek navy could use you for launching ships . Take it up with them , why do n't you ? " He reached up and patted her on the head and went out . I caught up with him on the sidewalk as he was hailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute ? " " It depends on what you want . " " I want to buy you a drink , ask you a few questions . " " I 've had a drink . Several , in fact . It 's late . I 'm beat . Write me a letter , why do n't you ? "  | " I ca n't write . " IIe brightened a little . " You mean to tell me you 're not an unrecognized literary genius ? I thought everybody was . " " I 'm a detective . I 'm looking for a man . You may have known him at one time . " His taxi had turned in the street and pulled into the curb . He signaled the driver to wait : " What 's his name ? " " John Brown . " " Oh sure , I knew him well at Harper 's Ferry . I 'm older than I look . " His empty clowning continued automatically while he sized me up . " In 1936 you printed a poem of his in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought that up . What a lousy name for a magazine . No wonder it folded . " " The name of the poem was ' Luna . " " I 'm afraid I do n't remember it . A lot of words have flowed under the bridge . I did know a John Brown back in the thirties . Whatever happened to John ? " " That 's what I 'm trying to find out . " " Okay , buy me a drink . But not at the Ear , eh ? I get tired of the shaves and the shave-nots . " Bolling dismissed his taxi . We walked about sixty feet to the next bar . A pair of old girls on the two front stools flapped their eyelashes at us as we went in . There was nobody else in the place but a comatose bartender . He roused himself long enough to pour us a couple of drinks . We sat down in one of the booths , and I showed Bolling my pictures of Tony Calton . " Do you recognize him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I only met him once or twice . Twice . He called on us when we were living in Sausalito . And then one Sunday when I was driving down the coast by Luna Bay , I returned the visit . "  | " Were they living at Luna Bay ? " " A few miles this side of it , in an old place on the ocean . I had the very devil of a time finding it , in spite of the directionsBrown had given me . I remember now , he asked me not to tell anyone else where he was living . I was the only one who knew . I do n't know why he singled me out , except that he was keen to have me visit his home , and see his son . He may have had some sort of father feeling about me , though I was n't much older than he was . " " He had a son ? " " Yes , they had a baby . He 'd just been born , and he was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father 's eye . They were quite a touching little family . " Bolling 's voice was gentle . Away from the crowd and the music he showed a different personality . Like other performers , he had a public face and a private one . Each of them was slightly phony , but the private face suited him better . " You met the wife , did you ? " " Certainly . She was sitting on the front porch when I got there , nursing the baby . She had lovely white breasts , and she did n't in the least mind exposing them . It made quite a picture , there on the bluff above the sea . I tried to get a poem out of her , but it did n't come off . I never really got to know her . " " What sort of a girl was she ? " " Very attractive , I 'd say , in the visual sense . She did n't have too much to say for herself . As a matter of fact , she massacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance for Brown . I 've seen other young writers and artists fall for girls like that . I 've been guilty of it myself , when I was in my pre-Freudian period . " He added wryly : " That means before I got analyzed . " " Do you remember her name ? "  | " Mrs. Brown 's name ? " He shook his head . " Sorry . In the poem I botched I called her Stella Maris , star of the sea . But that does n't help you , does it ? " " Can you tell me when you were there ? It must have been toward the end of the year 1936 . " " Yes . It was around Christmas , just before Christmas  --  I took along some bauble for the child . Young Brown was very pleased that I did . " Bolling pulled at his chin , lengtheninghis face . " It 's queer I never heard from him after that . " " Did you ever try to get in touch with him ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed him off . PerhapsI did , without intending to . The woods were full of young writers ; it was hard to keep track of them all . I was doing valid work in those days , and a lot of them came to me . Frankly , I 've hardly thought of Brown from that day to this . Is he still living on the coast ? " " I do n't know . What was he doing in Luna Bay , did he tell you ? " " He was trying to write a novel . He did n't seem to have a job , and I ca n't imagine what they were living on . They could n't have been completely destitute , either . They had a nurse to look after the mother and child . " " A nurse ? " " I suppose she was what you 'd call a practical nurse . One of those young women who take charge , " he added vaguely . " Do you recall anything about her ? " " She had remarkable eyes , I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think she approved of the literary life . " " Did you talk to her at all ? " " I may have . I have a distinct impression of her , that she was the only sensible person in the house . Brown and his wife seemed to be living in Cloud-Cuckoo-Land . " " How do you mean ? " " They were out of touch with the ordinary run of life . Ip65do n't mean that as a criticism . I 've been out of touch enough in my own life , God knows . I still am . " He gave me his clown grin . " You ca n't make a Hamlet without breaking egos . But let 's not talk about me . " " Getting back to the nurse , do you think you can remember her name ? " " I know perfectly well I ca n't . " " Would you recognize it if I said it ? " " That I doubt . But try me . " " Marian Culligan , " I said . " C-u-1-1-i-g-a-n . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bolling finished his drink and looked around the bar as if he expected something to happen . I guessed that most of the things that can happen to a man had already happened to him . He changed expressions like rubber masks , but between the masks I could see dismay in his face . " We might as well have another drink , " he said . " This one will be on me . I 'm loaded . I just made a hundred smackers at the Ear . " Even his commercialism sounded phony . While I lit a fire under the bartender , Bolling studied the photographs I 'd left on the table : " That 's John all right . A nice boy , and perhaps a talentedone , but out of this world . All the way out of this world . Where did he get the money for horses and tennis ? " " From his family . They 're heavily loaded . " " Good Lord , do n't tell me he 's the missing heir . Is that why you 're making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They waited long enough . " " You can say that again . Can you tell me how to get to thehouse the Browns were living in when you visited them ? " " I 'm afraid not . I might be able to show you , though . " " When ? " " Tomorrow morning if you like . " " That 's good of you . "  |p66Not  at all . I liked John Brown . Besides , I have n't been to I.iina Bay for years . Eons . Maybe I 'll rediscover my lost youth . " " Maybe . " But I did n't think it likely . Neither did he . IN THE morning I picked up Bolling at his Telegraph Hill apartment . It was one of those sparklingdays that make up for all the fog in San Francisco . An onshore wind had swept the air clear and tessellated the blue surface of the Bay . A white ship cutting a white furrow was headed out toward the Golden Gate . White gulls hung above her on the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was frowsy and gray and shivering with hangover . He crawled into the back seat and snored all the way to our destination . It was a dingy , formless town sprawling along the coast highway . Its low buildings were dwarfed by the hills rising behind it , the broad sea spreading out in front . I stopped beside a filling-station where the inland road met Highway i , and told Bolling to wake up . " Wha ' for ? " he mumbled from the depths of sleep . " Wha ' happen ? " " Nothing yet . Where do we go from here ? " He groaned and sat up and looked around . The glare from the ocean made his eyes water . He shaded them with his hand . " Where are we ? "  | " Luna Bay . " " It does n't look the same , " he complained . " I 'm not sure whether I can find the place or not . Anyway , we turn north here . Just drive along slowly , and I 'll try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luna Bay , the highway cut inland across the base of a promontory . On the far side of the promontory , a new-looking asphalt road turned off toward the sea . A billboard stood at the intersection : " MarvistaManor . Three bedrooms and rumpus room . Tile bathrooms . Built-in kitchens . All utilities in . See our model home . " Bolling tapped my shoulder . " This is the place , I think . " I backed up and made a left turn . The road ran straight for several hundred yards up a gentle slope . We passed a rectangle of bare adobe as big as a football field , where earth-movers were working . A wooden sign at the roadside explained their activity : " Site of the Marvista Shopping Center . " From the crest of the slope we looked down over the roof-tops of a hundred or more houses . They stood along the hillside on raw earth terraces which were only just beginning to sprout grass . Driving along the winding street between them , I could see that most of the houses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in the yards , clothes drying on the lines . The houses were painted different colors , which only seemed to emphasizetheir sameness . The street unwound itself at the foot of the slope , parallelingthe edge of the bluffs . I stopped the car and turned to look at Bolling . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " It 's changed so much , I ca n't be certainthis is the place . There were some clapboard bungalows , five or six of them , scattered along the bluff . The Browns lived in one of them , if memory serves me . " We got out and walked toward the edge of the bluff . Ap68couple of hundred feet below , the sea wrinkled like blue metal against its base , and burst in periodic white explosions . A mile to the south , under the shelter of the promontory , a cove of quiet water lay in a brown rind of beach . Bolling pointed toward the cove . " This has to be the place . I remember Brown telling me that inlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prohibition days . There used to be an old hotel on the bluff above it . You could see it from the Browns ' front porch . Their bungalow must have stood quite near here . " " They probably tore it down when they put in the road . It would n't have done me much good to see it , anyway . I was hoping I 'd run across a neighbor who remembered the Browns . " " I suppose you could canvass the tradesmen in Luna Bay . " " I could . " " Oh well , it 's nice to get out in the country . " Bolling wandered off along the edge of the bluff . Suddenlyhe said : " Wheel " in a high voice like a gull 's screak . He began to flap his arms . I ran toward him . " What 's the matter ? " " Wheel " he said again , and let out a childish laugh . " I was just imagining that I was a bird . " " How did you like it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " I can fly ! I breast the windy currents of the sky . I soar like Icarus toward the sun . The wax melts . I fall from a great height into the sea . Mother Thalassa . " " Mother who ? " " Thalassa , the sea , the Homeric sea . We could build another Athens . I used to think we could do it in San Francisco , build a new city of man on the great hills . A city measured with forgiveness . Oh , well . " His mood sank again . I pulled him away from the edge.  |p69He  was so unpredictable I thought he might take a flying leap into space , and I was beginning to like him . " Speaking of mothers , " I said , " if John Brown 's wife had just had a baby , she must have been going to a doctor . Did they happen to mention where the baby was born ? " " Yes . Right in their house . The nearest hospital is in RedwoodCity , and Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are she had a local doctor . " " Let 's hope he 's still around . " I drove back through the housing-tract until I saw a young woman walking a pram . She shied like a filly when I pulled up beside her . In the daytime the tract was reserved for women and children ; unknown men in cars were probably kidnappers . I got out and approached her , smilingas innocuously as I could . " I 'm looking for a doctor . " " Oh . Is somebody sick ? " " My friend 's wife is going to have a baby . They 're thinkingof moving into Marvista Manor , and they thought they 'd better check on the medical situation . " " Dr. Meyers is very good , " she said . " I go to him my-self . " " In Luna Bay ? " " That 's right . " " How long has he practiced there ? " " I would n't know . We just moved out from Richmond month before last . " " How old is Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n no . " " Too young , " I said . " If your friend will feel safer with an older man , I think there is one in town . I do n't remember his name , though . Personally I like a young doctor , they know all the latest wonder drugs and all . " Wonder drugs . I thanked her , and drove back to Limap70Bay in search of a drugstore . The proprietor gave me a rundownon the three local doctors . A Dr. George Dineen was the only one who had practiced there in the thirties . He was an elderly man on the verge of retirement . I 'd probably find him in his office if he was n't out on a call . It was only a couple of blocks from the drugstore . I left Bolling drinking coffee at the fountain , and walked to the doctor 's office . It occupied the front rooms of a ramblinghouse with green shingle walls which stood on a dusty side street . A woman of about sixty answered the door . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see too often any more , the look of a woman who has n't been disappointed : " Yes , young man ? " " I 'd like to see the doctor . " " His office hours are in the afternoon . They do n't start till one-thirty . " " I do n't want to see him as a patient . " " If you 're a pharmaceutical salesman , you 'd better wait till after lunch . Dr. Dineen does n't like his mornings to be disturbed . " " I 'm only in town for the morning . I 'm investigating a disappearance . he may be able to help me to find a missing man . " She had a very responsive face , in spite of its slack lines of age . Her eyes imagined what it would be like to lose a loved one . " Well , that 's different . Come in , Mr.  --  " " Archer . I 'm a private detective . " " My husband is in the garden . I 'll bring him in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomas hung on the wall above the old oak desk . The earliest stated that Dr. Dineen had graduated from the University of Ohio Medical School in 1914 . The room itself was like a preserve of prewar time . The cracked leather furniture had been molded by use into comfortable human shapes . A set ofp71old chessmen laid out on a board stood like miniature armies stalled in the sunlight that fell slanting from the window . The doctor came in and shook hands with me . He was a tall high-shouldered old man . His eyes were noncommittal under shaggy gray brows which hung like bird's-nests on the cliff of his face . He lowered himself into the chair behind his desk . His head was partly bald ; a few strands of hair lay lankly across the top of his scalp . " You mentioned a missing person to my wife . One of my patients , perhaps ? " " Perhaps . His name was John Brown . In 1936 he and his wife lived a few miles up the coast where the Marvista tract is now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor said . " Their son was in this office not so very long ago , sitting where you 're sitting . " " Their son ? " " John , Junior . You may know him . He 's looking for his father , too . " " No , " I said , " I do n't know him . But I 'd certainly like to . " " I daresay that could be arranged . " Dr. Dineen 's deep voice rumbled to a stop . He looked at me intently , as if he was getting ready to make a diagnosis . " First , I 'd want to know the reasons for your interest in the family . " " I was hired to make a search for the father , the senior John Brown . " " Has your search had any results ? " " Not until now . You say this boy who came to see you is looking for his father ? " " That is correct . " " What brought him to you ? " " He has the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to be with him . If his father is dead , he wants to know . "  | " 1 mean what brought him here to your office specifically ? had you known him before ? " " I brought him into the world . In my profession , that constitutesthe best possible introduction . " " Are you sure it 's the same boy ? " " I have no reason to doubt it . " The doctor looked at me with some distaste , as if I 'd criticized some work he 'd done with his hands . " Before we go any further , Mr. Archer , you can oblige me with a fuller response to my question . You have n't told me who hired you . " " Sorry , I ca n't do that . I 've been asked to keep my client 's identity confidential . " " " No doubt you have . I 've been keeping such matters confidentialfor the past forty years . " " And you wo n't talk unless I do , is that it ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , like an annoying insect . " I suggested no bargain . I simply want to know who I 'm dealing with . There may be grave matters involved . " " There are . " " I think you ought to elucidate that remark . " " I ca n't . " We faced each other in a stretching silence . His eyes were steady , and bright with the hostility of a proud old man . I was afraid of losing him entirely , just as the case seemed to be breaking open . While I did n't doubt his integrity , I had my own integrity to think of , too . I 'd promisedGordon Sable and Mrs. Gallon to name no names . Dr. Dineen produced a pipe , and began to pack its charred bowl with tobacco from an oilskin pouch . " We seem to have reached a stalemate . Do you play chess , Mr. Archer ? " " Not as well as you do , probably . I 've never studied the book . " " I would have thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a kitchen match . The blue smoke swirled in the hollow shafts of sunlight from the window . " We 're wasting both our times . I suggest you make a move . " " I thought this was a stalemate . " " New game . " A flicker of interest showed in his eyes for the first time . " Tell me about yourself . Why would a man of your sort spend his life doing the kind of work you do ? Do you make much money ? " " Enough to live on . I do n't do it for the money , though . I do it because I want to . " " Is n't it dirty work , Mr. Archer ? " " It depends on who 's doing it , like doctoring or anything else . I try to keep it clean . " " Do you succeed ? " " Not entirely . I 've made some bad mistakes about people . Some of them assume that a private detective is automaticallycrooked , and they act accordingly , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunt which sounded like a seal 's bark . " I ca n't act blindly in a matter of this importance . " " Neither can I. I do n't know what makes it important to you  --  " " I 'll tell you , " he said shortly . " Human lives are involved . A boy 's love for his parents is involved . I try to handle these things with the care they deserve . " " I appreciate that . You seem to have a special interest in John Brown , Junior . " " I do have . The young fellow 's had a rough time of it . I do n't want him hurt unnecessarily . " " It 's not my intention to hurt him . If the boy is actually John Brown 's son , you 'd be doing him a favor by leading me to him . " " You 're going to have to prove that to me . I 'll be frank to say I 've had one or two experiences with private detectives in my time . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine  --  a young girl who had a child out of wedlock . I do n't mean that reflects on you , but it makes a man leery . " All right . I 'll put my position hypothetically . Let 's say I 'd been hired to find the heir to several million dollars . " " I 've heard that one before . You 'll have to invent a better gambit than that . " " I did n't invent it . It happens to be the truth . " " Prove it . " " That will be easy to do when the time comes . Right now , I 'd say the burden of proof is on this boy . Can he prove his identity ? " " The question never came up . As a matter of fact , the proof of his identity is on his face . I knew whose son he was as soon as he stepped in here . His resemblance to his father is striking . " " How long ago did he turn up ? " " About a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient ? " " As a friend , " Dineen said . " Why did he come to you in the first place ? " " My name is on his birth certificate . Now hold your horses , young man . Give me a chance to think . " The doctor smoked in silence for a while . " Do you seriously tell me that this boy is heir to a fortune ? " " He will be , if his father is dead . His grandmother is still living . She has the money . " " But you wo n't divulge her name ? " " Not without her permission . I suppose I could call her long distance . But I 'd rather have a chance to talk to the boy first . " The doctor hesitated . He held his right hand poised in the air , then struck the desk-top with the flat of it . " I 'll take a chance on you , though I may regret it later . " " You wo n't if I can help it . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to that . " " What did he have to say about his origins ? " " It would be more appropriate if you got that from him . I 'm willing to tell you what I know about his father and mother from my own direct observation . And this has more relevance than you may think . " He paused . " What precisely did this anonymous client of yours hire you to do ? " " Find John Brown , Senior , " I said . " I take it that is n't his real name . " " That 's right , it is n't . " " I 'm not surprised , " Dineen said . " At the time I knew him , I did some speculating about him . It occurred to me he might be a remittance man  --  one of those ne'er-do-wells whose families paid them to stay away from home . I remember when his wife was delivered , Brown paid me with a hundred-dollar-bill . It did n't seem to suit with their scale of living . And there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  diamonds and rubies in ornate gold settings . One day she came in here like a walking jewelry store . " I warned her not to wear them . They were living out in the country , near the old Inn , and it was fairly raw territory in those days . Also , people were poor . A lot of them used to pay me for my services in fish . I had so much fish during the Depression I 've never eaten it since . No matter . A public display of jewels was an incitement to robbery . I told the young lady so , and she left off wearing them , at least when I saw her . " " Did you see her often ? " " Four or five times , I 'd say . Once or twice before the boy was born , and several times afterwards . She was a healthy enough wench , no complications . The main thing I did for her was to instruct her in the care of an infant . Nothing in her background had prepared her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background ? " " She did n't have to . It had left marks on her body , forp76one thing . She 'd been beaten half to death with a belt buckle . " " Not by her husband ? " " Hardly . There had been other men in her life , as the phrase goes . I gathered that she 'd been on her own from an early age . She was one of the wandering children of the thirties  --  quite a different sort from her husband . " " How old was she ? " " I think nineteen or twenty , perhaps older . She looked older . Her experiences had n't hardened her , but as I said they left her unprepared for motherhood . Even after she was back on her feet , she needed a nurse to help her care for the child . Actually , she was a child herself in emotional development . " " Do you remember the nurse 's name ? " " Let me see . I believe she was a Mrs. Kerrigan . " " Or Culligan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good young woman , fairly well trained . I believe she took off at the same time the Brown family did . " " The Brown family took off ? " " They skipped , without a good-by or a thank-you to anybody . Or so it appeared at the time . " " When was this ? " " A very few weeks after the child was born . It was close to Christmas Day of 1936 , I think a day or two after . I remember it so distinctly because I 've gone into it since with the sheriff 's men . " " Recently ? " " Within the last five months . To make a long story short , when they were clearing the land for the Marvista tract , a set of bones were unearthed . The local deputy asked me to look them over to see what I could learn from them . I did so . They were human bones , which had probably belonged to a man of medium height , in his early twenties.  | " It 's not unlikely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones . They were found buried under the house he lived in . The house was torn down to make way for the new road . Unfortunately , we had no means of making a positive identification . The skull was missing , which ruled out the possibility of dental evidence . " " It rules in the possibility of murder . " Dineen nodded gravely . " There 's rather more than a possibility of murder . One of the cervical vertebrae had been cut through by a heavy instrument . I 'd say John Brown , if that is who he is , was decapitated with an ax . " BEFORE I left Dr. Dineen , he gave me a note of introduction to the deputy in charge of the local sheriff 's office , written on a prescription blank ; and the address of the gas station where John Brown , Jr. , worked . I walked back to the drugstore in a hurry . Bolling was still at the fountain , with a grilled cheese sandwich in his left hand and a pencil in his right . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry to keep you waiting  --  " " Excuse me , I 'm writing a poem . " He went on scribbling . I ate an impatient sandwich while he finished , and dragged him out to the car : " I want to show you somebody ; I 'll explain who he is later . " I started the car and turned south on the highway . " What 's your poem about ? "  | " The city of man . I 'm making a break-through into the affirmative . It 's going to be good  --  the first good poem I 've written in years . " Ile went on telling me about it , in language which I did n't understand . I found the place I was looking for on the southern outskirts of the town . It was a small independentstation with three pumps , one attendant . The attendant was a young man in white drill coveralls . He was busy gassing a pickup truck whose bed was piled with brown fishermen 's nets . I pulled in behind it and watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calton . He had the same light eyes set wide apart , the same straight nose and full mouth . Only his hair was different ; it was dark and straight . Bolling was leaning forward in the seat . " For Christ 's sake ! Is it Brown ? It ca n't be Brown . He 's almost as old as I am . " " He had a son , remember . " " Is this the son ? " " I think so . Do you remember the color of the baby 's hair ? " " It was dark , what there was of it . Like his mother 's . " Bolling started to get out of the car . " Wait a minute , " I said . " Do n't tell him who you are . " " I want to ask him about his father . " " He does n't know where his father is . Besides , there 's a question of identity . I want to see what he says without any prompting . " Bolling gave me a frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver of the pickup paid for his gas and rattled away . I pulled up even with the pumps , and got out for a better look at the boy . He appeared to be about twenty-one or - two . He was very good-looking , as his putative father had been . His smile was engaging.  | " What can I do for you , sir ? " " Fill her up . It 'll only take a couple of gallons . I stopped because I want you to check the oil . " " I 'll be glad to , sir . " He seemed like a willing boy . He filled the tank , and wiped the windshield spotless . But when he lifted the hood to check the oil , he could n't find the dip-stick . I showed him where it was . " Been working here long ? " He looked embarrassed . " Two weeks . I have n't caught on to all the new cars yet . " " Think nothing of it . " I looked across the highway at the windswept shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice country . I would n't mind settling out here . " " Are you from San Francisco ? " " My friend is . " I indicated Bolling , who was still in the car , sulking . " I came up from Santa Teresa last night . " He did n't react to the name . " Who owns the beach property across the highway , do you know ? " " I 'm sorry , I would n't know . My boss probably would , though . " " Where is he ? " " Mr. Turnell has gone to lunch . He should be back pretty soon , if you want to talk to him . " " How soon ? " He glanced at the cheap watch on his wrist . " Fifteen or twenty minutes . His lunch-hour is from eleven to twelve . It 's twenty to twelve now . " " I might as well wait for him . I 'm in no hurry . " Bolling was in visible pain by this time . He made a conspiratorialgesture , beckoning me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said in a stage whisper . " Could be " " Why do n't you ask him ? "  | " I 'm waiting for him to tell me . Take it easy , Mr. Bolling . " " May I talk to him ? " " I 'd just as soon you did n't . This is a ticklish business . " " I do n't see why it should be . Either he is or he is n't . " The boy came up behind me . " Is something the matter , sir ? Anything more I can do ? " " Nothing on both counts . The service was fine . " " Thank you . " His teeth showed bright in his tanned face . His smile was strained , though . He seemed to sense the tension in me and Bolling . I said as genially as I knew how : " Are you from these parts ? " " I could say I was , I guess . I was born a few miles from here . " " But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can you tell ? " " Accent . I 'd say you were raised in the middle west . " " I was . " He seemed pleased by my interest . " I just came out from Michigan this year . " " Have you had any higher education ? " " College , you mean ? As a matter of fact I have . Why do you ask ? " " I was thinking you could do better for yourself than jockeying a gas pump . " " I hope to , " he said , with a look of aspiration . " I regard this work as temporary . " " What kind of work would you like to do ? " He hesitated , flushing under his tan . " I 'm interested in acting . I know that sounds ridiculous . Half the people who come to California probably want to be actors . " " Is that why you came to California ? " " It was one of the reasons . " " This is a way-stop to Hollywood for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " His face was closing up . Too many questions were making him suspicious . " Ever been to Hollywood ? " " No . I have n't . " " Had any acting experience ? " " I have as a student . " " Where ? " " At the University of Michigan . " I had what I wanted : a way to check his background , if he was telling the truth ; if he was lying , a way to prove that he was lying . Universities kept full dossiers on their students . " The reason I 'm asking you all these questions , " I said , " is this . I have an office on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood . I 'm interested in talent , and I was struck by your appear-ance . " He brightened up considerably . " Are you an agent ? " " No , but I know a lot of agents . " I wanted to avoid the lie direct , on general principles , so I brought Bolling into the conversation : " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may have heard of him . " Bolling was confused . He was a sensitive man , and my underhanded approach to the boy troubled him . He leaned out of the car to shake hands : " Pleased to meet you . " " I 'm very glad to meet you , sir . My name is John Brown , by the way . Are you in the picture business ? " " No . " Bolling was tongue-tied by the things he wanted to say and was n't supposed to . The boy looked from Bolling to me , wondering what he had done to spoil the occasion . Bolling took pity on him . With a defiant look at me , he said : " Did you say your name was John Brown ? I knew a John Brown once , in Luna Bay . "  | " Chat was my father 's name . You must have known my father . " " I believe I did . " Bolling climbed out of the car . " I met you when you were a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed up warmly . His gray eyes shone with pleasure , and then were moist with deeper feelings . I had to remind myself that he was a self-admitted actor . He pumped Bolling 's hand a second time . " Imagine your knowing my father ! How long is it since you 've seen him ? " " Twenty-two years  --  a long time . " " Then you do n't know where he is now ? " " I 'm afraid not , John . He dropped out of sight , you know , quite soon after you were born . " The boy 's face stiffened . " And Mother ? " His voice cracked on the word . " Same story , " I said . " Do n't you remember either of your parents ? " He answered reluctantly : " I remember my mother . She left me in an orphanage in Ohio when I was four . She promised to come back for me , but she never did come back . I spent nearly twelve years in that institution , waiting for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then I realized she must be dead . I ran away . " " Where was it ? " I said . " What town ? " " Crystal Springs , a little place near Cleveland . " " And you say you ran away from there ? " " Yes , when I was sixteen . I went to Ann Arbor , Michigan , to get an education . A man named Lindsay took me in . He did n't adopt me , but he let me use his name . I went to school under the name of John Lindsay . " " Why the name change ? " " I did n't want to use my own name . I had good reason . " " Are you sure it was n't the other way around ? Are youp83sure John Lindsay was n't your real name , and you took the name of Brown later ? " " Why would I do that ? " " Somebody hired you , maybe . " He flushed up darkly . " Who are you ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was all that bushwa about Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard ? " " I have my office on Sunset Boulevard . " " But what you said was deliberately misleading . " " Do n't worry about me so much . I needed some information , and I got it . " " You could have asked me directly . I have nothing to hide . " " That remains to be seen . " Bolling stepped between us , sputtering at me in sudden anger : " Leave the boy alone now . He 's obviously genuine . He even has his father 's voice . Your implications are an in-sult . " I did n't argue with him . In fact , I was ready to believe he was right . The boy stepped back away from us as if we 'd threatened his life . His eyes had turned the color of slate , and there were white rims on his nostrils : " What is this , anyway ? " " Do n't get excited , " I said . " I 'm not excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and ask me a bunch of questions and tell me you knew my father . Naturally I want to know what it means . " Bolling moved toward him and laid an impulsive hand on his arm . " It could mean a great deal to you , John . Your father belonged to a wealthy family . " The boy brushed him off . He was young for his age in some ways . " I do n't care about that . I want to see my father . "  | " Wily is it so important ? " Bolling said . " I never had a father . " His working face was naked to the light . Tears ran down his cheeks . He shook them off angrily . I bought him , and made a down payment : " I 've asked enough questions for now , John . Have you talked to the local police , by the way ? " " Yes , I have . And I know what you 're getting at . They have a box of bones at the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's bones , but I do n't believe it . Neither does Deputy Mungan . " " Do you want to come down there with me now ? " " I ca n't , " he said . " I ca n't close up the station . Mr. Turnell expects me to stay on the job . " " What time do you get off ? " " About seven-thirty , week nights . " " Where can I get in touch with you tonight ? " " I live in a boardinghouse about a mile from here . Mrs. Gorgello 's . " He gave me the address . " Are n't you going to tell him who his father was ? " Bollingsaid . " I will when it 's been proved . Let 's go , Bolling . " He climbed into the car reluctantly . THE Sheriff 's substation was a stucco shoebox of a building across the street from a sad-looking country hotel . Bolling said he would stay in the car , on the grounds that skeletons frightened him :  | " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike Webster in Mr. Eliot 's poem , I like to remain oblivious to the skull beneath the skin . " I never knew whether Bolling was kidding me . Deputy Mungan was a very large man , half a head taller than I was , with a face like unfinished sculpture . I gave him my name and occupation , and Dineen 's note of introduction . When he 'd read it , he reached across the counter that dividedhis little office , and broke all the bones in my hand : " Any friend of Doc Dineen 's is a friend of mine . Come on in around behind and tell me your business . " I went on in around behind and sat in the chair he placed for me at the end of his desk : " It has to do with some bones that were found out in the Marvista tract . I understand you 've made a tentative iden-tification . " " I would n't go so far as to say that . Doc Dineen thinks it was a man he knew  --  fellow by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the location of the body , all right . But we have n't been able to nail it down . The trouble is , no such man was ever reported missing in these parts . We have n't been able to turn up any local antecedents . Naturally we 're still working on it . " Mungan 's broad face was serious . He talked like a trained cop , and his eyes were sharp as tacks . I said : " We may be able to help each other to clarify the issue . " " Any help you can give me will be welcome . This has been dragging on for five months now , more like six . " He threw out a quick hooked question : " You represent his family , maybe ? " " I represent a family . They asked me not to use their name . And there 's still a question whether they are the dead man 's family . Was there any physical evidence found with the bones ? A watch , or a ring ? Shoes ? Clothing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I suppose it could rot away completely in twenty-two years . What about buttons ? " " No buttons . Our theory is he was buried the way he came into the world . " " But without a head . " Mungan nodded gravely . " Doc Dineen filled you in , eh ? I 've been thinking about that head myself . A young fellow came in here a few weeks ago , claimed to be John Brown 's son . " Do n't you think he is ? " " He acted like it . He got pretty upset when I showed him the bones . Unfortunately , he did n't know any more about his father than I do . Which is nil , absolutely nil . We know this John Brown lived out on the old Bluff Road for a couple of months in 1936 , and that 's the sum-total of it . On top of that , the boy does n't believe these are his father 's bones . And he could just be right . I 've been doing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head , now . We assumed when the body was first turned up , that he was killed by having his head cut off . " Mungan made a snicking sound between tongue and palate , and sheared the air with the edge of his huge hand . " Maybe he was . Or maybe the head was chopped off after death , to remove identification . You know how much we depend on teeth and fillings . Back in the thirties , before we developed our modern lab techniques , teeth and fillings were the main thing we had to go on . " If my hypothesis is right , the killer was a pro . And that fits in with certain other facts . In the twenties and thirties , the Bluff Road area was a stamping ground for hoods . It was until quite recently , as a matter of fact . In those days it was a real hotbed . A lot of the liquor that kept San Francisco going during Prohibition came in by sea and was funneled through Luna Bay . They brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women from Mexico and Panama . You ever hear of the Red Horse Inn ? " " No . " " It stood on the coast about a mile south of where we found the skeleton . They tore it down a couple of years ago , after we put the stopper on it . That was a place with a history . It used to be a resort hotel for well-heeled people from the City and the Peninsula . The rum-runners took it over in the twenties . They converted it into a three-way operation : liquor warehouse in the basement , bars and gaming on the first floor , women upstairs . The reason I know so much about it , I had my first drink there back about 1930 . And my first woman . " " You do n't look that old . " " I was sixteen at the time . I think that 's one of the reasons I went into law enforcement . 1 wanted to put bastards like Lempi out of circulation . Lempi was the boss hood who ran the place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law got to him before I grew up to his size . They got him for income tax in 1932 , he died on the Rock a few years later . Some of his guns were sent up at the same time . " I knew those boys , see , and this is the point I 'm coming to . I knew what they were capable of doing . They killed for pay , and they killed because they enjoyed it . They bragged in public that nobody could touch them . It took a federal indictment to cool Lempi . Meantime a number of people lost their lives . Our Mr. Bones could be one of them . " " But you say Lempi and his boys were cleaned out in ' 32 . Our man was killed in ' 36 . " " We do n't know that . We jumped to that conclusion on the basis of what Doc Dineen said , but we 've got no concreteevidence to go on . The Doc himself admits that given the chemistry of that particular soil , he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Mr. Bones couldp88have been knocked off as early as 1931 . I say could have . " " Or as late as 1941 ? " I said . " That 's right . You see how little we have to go on . " Do I get to take a look at what you have ? " " Why not ? " Mungan went into a back room and returned lugging a metal box about the size of a hope chest . He set it on top of his desk , unlocked it , lifted the lid . Its contents were jumbled like kindling . Only the vertebrae had been articulatedwith wire , and lay coiled on the heap like the skeleton of a snake . Mungan showed me where the neck bone had been severed by a cutting instrument . The larger bones had been labeled : left femur , left fibula , and so on . Mungan picked out a heavy bone about a foot long ; it was marked " right humerus . " " This is the bone of the upper arm , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on over to the window here . I want to show you something . " He held the bone to the light . Close to one knobbed end , I made out a thin line filled and surrounded by deposits of calcium . " A break ? " I said . " I hope in more senses than one . It 's a mended fracture , the only unusual thing in the entire skeleton . Dineen says it was probably set by a trained hand , a doctor . If we could find the doctor that set it , it would answer some of our questions . So if you 've got any ideas . . . " Mungan let his voice trail off , but his eyes stayed hard on my face . " I 'll do some telephoning . " " You can use my phone . " " A pay phone would suit me better . " " If you say so . There 's one across the street , in the hotel . " I found the telephone booth at the rear of the dingy hotel lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's secretary put him on the line.  | " Archer speaking , the one-man dragnet , " I said . " I 'm in Luna Bay . " " You 're where ? " " Luna Bay . It 's a small town on the coast south of San Francisco . I have a couple of items for you : a dead man 's bones , and a live boy . Let 's start with the bones . " " Bones ? " " Bones . They were dug up by accident about six months ago , and they 're in the sheriff 's substation here . They 're unidentified , but the chances are better than even that they belong to the man I 'm looking for . The chances are also better than even that he was murdered twenty-two years ago . " The line was silent . " Did you get that , Sable ? He was probably murdered . " " I heard you . But you say the remains have n't been iden-tified . " " That 's where you can help me , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fracture in the right humerus , close to the elbow . It was evidently set by a doctor . I want you to check on whether Tony Galton ever had a broken right arm . If so , who was the doctor that looked after it ? It may have been Howell , in which case there 's no sweat . I 'll call you back in fifteen minutes . " " Wait . You mentioned a boy . What 's he got to do with all this ? " " That remains to be seen . He thinks he 's the dead man 's son . " " Tony 's son ? " " Yes , but he is n't sure about it . He came here from Michigan in the hope of finding out who his father was . " " Do you think he 's Tony 's son ? " " I would n't bet my life savings on it . I would n't bet against it , either . He bears a strong resemblance to Tony . On the other hand , his story is weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's pretty long and complicated for the telephone . He was brought up in an orphanage , he says , went to college under an assumed name , came out here a month ago to find out who he really is . I do n't say it could n't have happenedthe way he says , but it needs to be proved out . " " What kind of a boy is he ? " " Intelligent , well spoken , fairly well mannered . If he 's a con artist , he 's smooth for his age . " " How old is he ? " " Twenty-two . " " You work very quickly , " he said . " I was lucky . What about your end ? Has Trask got anything on my car ? " " Yes . It was found abandoned in San Luis Obispo . " " Wrecked ? " " Out of gas . It 's in perfectly good shape , I saw it myself . Trask has it impounded in the county garage . " " What about the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another car in San Luis . One disappeared late yesterday afternoon . Incidentally , Trask tells me that the Jaguar , the murder car , as he calls it , was another stolen car . " " Who was the owner ? " " I have no idea . The Sheriff is having the engine number traced . " I hung up , and spent the better part of fifteen minutes thinking about Marion Culligan Matheson and her respectablelife in Redwood City which I was going to have to invadeagain . Then I called Sable back . The line was busy . I tried again in ten minutes , and got him . " I 've been talking to Dr. Howell , " he said . " Tony broke his right arm when he was in prep school . Howell did n't set the break himself , but he knows the doctor who did . In any case , it was a fractured humerus. "  | " See if they can turn up the X-ray , will you ? They do n't usually keep X-ray pictures this long , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can think of for making a positive identification . " " What about teeth ? " " Everything above the neck is missing . " It took Sable a moment to grasp this . Then he said : " Good Lord ! " After another pause : " Perhaps I should drop everything and come up there . What do you think ? " " It might be a good idea . It would give you a chance to interview the boy . " " I believe I 'll do that . Where is he now ? " " Working . He works at a gas station in town . How long will it take you to get here ? " " I 'll be there between eight and nine . " " Meet me at the sheriff 's substation at nine . In the meantime , is it all right if I take the local deputy into my confidence ? He 's a good man . " " I 'd just as soon you did n't . " " You ca n't handle murder without publicity . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But then we do n't know for certain that the victim was Tony , do we ? " Before I could give him any further argument , Sable hung up . I PHONED the Santa Teresa courthouse . After some palaver , I got Sheriff Trask himself on the other end of the line . He sounded harried : " What is it ? "  | " Gordon Sable just told me you traced the murder car in the Culligan case . " " A fat lot of good it did us . It was stolen in San Francisco night before last . The thief changed the license plates . " " Who owns it ? " " San Francisco man . I 'm thinking of sending somebody up to talk to him . Far as I can make out , he did n't report the theft . " " That does n't sound so good . I 'm near San Francisco now , in Luna Bay . Do you want me to look him up ? " " I 'd be obliged . I ca n't really spare anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel called the Sussex Arms . " An hour later , I drove into the garage under UnionSquare . Bolling said good-by to me at the entrance : " Good luck with your case . " " Good luck with your poem . And thanks . " The Sussex Arms was another side-street hotel like the one I had spent the night in . It was several blocks closer to Market Street , and several degrees more dilapidated . The desk clerk had large sorrowful eyes and a very flexible manner , as if he had been run through all the wringers of circumstance . He said Mr. Lemberg was probably at work . " Where does he work ? " " He 's supposed to be a car salesman . " " Supposed to be ? " " I do n't think he 's doing so good . He 's just on commission with a secondhand dealer . The reason I know , he tried to sell me a car . " He snickered , as if he possessed the secret of a more advanced type of transportation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , more or less . This would n't happen to be a police matter ? " " I want to see him on personal business . "  | " Maybe Mrs. Lemberg is up in the room . She usually is . " " Try her , will you ? My name is Archer . I 'm interested in buying their car . " He went to the switchboard and relayed the message . " Mrs. Lemberg says come right on up . It 's three-eleven . You can take the elevator . " The elevator jerked me up to the third floor . At the end of the dust-colored hallway , a blonde in a pink robe gleamed like a mirage . Closer up , her luster was dimmer . She had darkness at the roots of her hair , and a slightly desperate smile . She waited until I was practically standing on her feet ; then she yawned and stretched elastically . She had wine and sleep on her breath . But her figure was very good , lushbreastedand narrow-waisted . I wondered if it was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lemberg ? " " Yeah . What 's all this about the Jag ? Somebody phones this morning and he tells them it was stole . And now you want to buy it . " " Was the car stolen ? " " That was just some of Roy 's malarkey . He 's full of it . You serious about buying ? " " Only if he has clear title , " I said fussily . My show of reluctance made her eager , as it was intended to . " Come in , we 'll talk about it . The Jag is in his name , but I 'm the one that makes the money decisions . " I followed her into the little room . At the chinks in the drawn blinds , daylight peered like a spy . She turned on a lamp and waved her hand vaguely toward a chair . A man 's shirt hung on the back of it . A half-empty half-gallon jug of muscatel stood on the floor beside it . " Siddown , excuse the mess . With all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to houseclean. "  | " What do you do ? " " I model . Go ahead , siddown . That shirt is ready for the laundry , anyway . " I sat down against the shirt . She flung herself on the bed , her body falling automatically into a cheesecake pose : " Were you thinking of paying cash ? " " If I buy . " " We sure could use a chunk of ready cash . What price did you have in mind ? I 'm warning you , I wo n't let it go too cheap . That 's my chief recreation in life , driving out in the country . The trees and everything . " Her own words seemed to bewilder her . " Not that he takes me out in it . I hardly ever see the car any more . That brother of his monopolizes it . Roy 's so soft , he do n't stick up for his rights the way he should . Like the other night . " " What happened the other night ? " " Just more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual . He 's got another one of these big job opportunities that never pan out . All he needs is a car , see , and he 'll be making a fortune in no time . So Roy lends him the car , just like that . Tommy could talk the fillings right out of his teeth . " " How long ago was this ? " " Night before last , I think . I lose count of the nights and days . " " I did n't know Roy had a brother , " I prompted her . " Yeah , he 's got a brother . " Ilcr voice was flat . " Roy 's all fixed up with a brother , till death doth us part . We 'd still be in Nevada , living the life of O'Reilly , if it was n't for that punk . " " How so ? " " I 'm talking too much . " But bad luck had dulled her brains , bad wine had loosened her tongue : " The Adult Authoritysaid they 'd give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back we move to California , to make a home for Tommy . " I thought : This is a home ? She caught my look : " We did n't always live here . We made a down payment on a real nice little place in Daly City . But Roy started drinking again , we could n't hold onto it . " She turned over onto her stomach , supporting her chin on her hand . Her china-blue eyes looked fractured in the light . " Not that I blame him , " she added more softly . " That brother of his would drive a saint to drink . Roy never hurt nobody in his life . Except me , and you expect that from any man . " I was touched by her asphalt innocence . The long curve of her hip and thigh , the rich flesh of her bosom , were like the disguise of a frightened adolescent . " What was Tommy in for ? " " He beat up a guy and took his wallet . The wallet had three bucks in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That works out to fifty cents a month . Tommy must be quite a mastermind . " " Yeah , to hear him tell it . It was supposed to be longer , but I guess he 's good when he 's in , with somebody watching him . It 's just when he gets out . " She cocked her head sideways , and her bright hair fell across her hand . " I do n't know why I 'm telling you all this . In my experience , the guys do most of the talking . I guess you have a talkable-attable face . " " You 're welcome to the use of it . " " Sanctuary mucho . But you came here to buy a car . I was almost forgetting . I worry so much , I forget things . " Her gaze slid down from my face to the muscatel jug . " I had a few drinkies , too , if the truth be knownst . " She drew a lock of hair across her eyes and looked at me through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When can I have a look at the Jaguar ? "  | " Any time , I guess . Maybe you better talk to Roy . " " Where can I find him ? " " Do n't ask me . Tell you the truth , I do n't even know if Tommy brought it back yet . " " Why did Roy say the car was stolen ? " " I du n no . I was half asleep when he left . I did n't ask him . " The thought of sleep made her yawn . She dropped her head and lay still . Traffic went by in the street like a hostile army . Then footsteps came down the corridor and paused outside the door . A man spoke softly through it : " You busy , Fran ? " She raised herself on her arms like a fighter hearing a far-off count . " Is that you , hon ? " " Yeah . You busy ? " " Not so 's you 'd notice . Come ahead in . " He flung the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excuse me . " His dark eyes were quick and uncertain . He was still in his early thirties , but he had a look about him , intangible and definite as an odor . The look of a man who has lost his grip and is sliding . His suit was sharply pressed , but it had n't been cleaned for too long . The very plumpness of his face gave it a lardlike inertness , as if it had stopped reacting to everything but crises . His face interested me . Unless I was getting hipped on family resemblances , he was an older softer version of the boy who 'd stolen my car . This one 's dark curls were thinner and limper . And the violence of the younger man was petulancein him . He said to his wife : " You told me you were n't busy . " " I 'm not . I 'm only resting . " She rolled over and sat up . " This gentleman wants to buy the Jaguar . " " It 's not for sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you it was ? "  | " Grapevine . " " What else did you hear ? " He was quick on the uptake . I could n't hope to con him for long , so I struck at his vulnerable spot : " Your brother 's in trouble . " His gaze went to my shoulder , my hands , my mouth , and then my eyes . I think in his extremity he would have liked to hit me . But I could have broken him in half , and he must have known it . Still , anger or frustration made him foolish : " Did Schwartz send you to tell me this ? " " Who ? " " You need n't play dumb . Otto Schwartz . " He gargled the words . " If he sent you , you can take a message back for me . Tell him to take a running jump in the Truckee River and do us all a favor . " I got up . Instinctively , one of Lemberg 's arms rose to guard his face . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your brother 's in very bad trouble . So are you . He drove down south to do a murder yesterday . You provided the car . " " I did n't know whah  --  " His jaw hung open , and then clicked shut . " Who are you ? " " A friend of the family . Show me where Tommy is . " " But I do n't know . He is n't in his room . He never came back . " The woman said : " Are you from the Adult Authority ? " " No . " " Who are you ? " Lemberg repeated . " What do you want ? " " Your brother , Tommy . " " I do n't know where Tommy is . I swear . " " What 's Otto Schwartz got to do with you and Tommy ? " " I do n't know . " " You brought up his name . Did Schwartz give Tommy a contract to murder Culligan ? "  | " Who ? " the woman said . " Who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know him ? " " No , " Lemberg answered for her . " We do n't know him . " I advanced on him : " You 're lying , Lemberg . You better let down your back hair , tell me all about it . Tommy is n't the only one in trouble . You 're accessory to any crime he did . " He backed away until the backs of his legs were touching the bed . He looked down at his wife as if she was his only source of comfort . She was looking at me : " What did you say Tommy did ? " " He committed a murder . " " For gosh sake . " She swung her legs down and stood up facing her husband . " And you lent him the car ? " " I had to . It was his car . It was only in my name . " " Because he was on parole ? " I said . He did n't answer me . The woman took hold of his arm and shook it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where he is . " Lemberg turned to me : " And that 's the honest truth . " " What about Schwartz ? " " Tommy used to work for him , when we lived in Reno . They were always asking him to come back to work . " " Doing what ? " " Any dirty thing they could dream up . " " Including murder ? " " Tommy never did a murder . " " Before this one , you mean . " " I 'll believe it when I hear it from him . " The woman groaned . " Do n't be an idiot all your life . What did he ever do for you , Roy ? " " He 's my brother . " " Do you expect to hear from him ? " I said.  | " I hope so . " " If you do , will you let me know ? " " Sure I will , " he lied . I went down in the elevator and laid a ten-dollar bill on the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languid eyebrow : " What 's this for ? You want to check in ? " " Not today , thanks . It 's your certificate of membership in the junior G-men society . Tomorrow you get your intermediatecertificate . " " Another ten ? " " You catch on fast . " " What do I have to do for it ? " " Keep track of Lemberg 's visitors , if he has any . And any telephone calls , especially long-distance calls . " " Can do . " " His hand moved quickly , flicking the bill out of sight . " What about her visitors ? " " Does she have many ? " " They come and go . " " She pay you to let them come and go ? " " That 's between me and her . Are you a cop ? " " Not me , " I said , as if his question was an insult . " Just keep the best track you can . If it works out , I may give you a bonus . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll mention you in my memoirs . " " That will be just ducky . " " What 's your name ? " " Jerry Farnsworth . " " " Will you be on duty in the morning ? " " What time in the morning ? " " Any time . " " For a bonus I can be . " " An extra five , " I said , and went outside . There was a magazine shop on the opposite corner . 1p100crossed to it , bought a Saturday Review , and punched a hole in the cover . For an hour or more , I watched the front of the Sussex Arms , trusting that Lemberg would n't penetratemy literate disguise . But Lemberg did n't come out . IT WAS past five when I got to RedwoodCity . The commuting trains were running south every few minutes . The commuters in their uniforms , hat on head , briefcase in hand , newspaper under arm , marched wearily toward their waiting cars . The cop on traffic duty at the station corner told me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior-executive residential section , several cuts above the Marvista tract . The houses were set further apart , and differed from each other in architectural detail . Flowers bloomed competitively in the yards . A bicycle lay on the grass in front of the Matheson house . A small boy answered my knock . He had black eyes like his mother 's , and short brown hair which stuck up all over his head like visible excitement . " I was doing pushups , " he said , breathing hard . " You want my daddy ? He ai n't , I mean , he is n't home from the city yet . " " Is your mother home ? " " She went to the station to get him . They ought to be back in about eleven minutes . That 's how old I am . " " Eleven minutes ? "  | " Eleven years . I had my birthday last week . You want to see me do some pushups ? " " All right . " " Come in , I 'll show you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large brick fireplace with a raised hearth . Everything in the room was so new and clean , the furniture so carefully placed around it , that it seemed forbidding . The boy flung himself down in the middle of the green broadloom carpet : " Watch me . " He did a series of pushups , until his arms collapsed under him . He got up panting like a dog on a hot day : " Now that I got the knack , I can do pushups all night if I want to . " " You would n't want to wear yourself out . " " Shucks , I 'm strong . Mr. Steele says I 'm very strong for my age , it 's just my co-ordination . Here , feel my muscle . " He pulled up the sleeve of his jersey , flexed his biceps , and produced an egg-sized lump . I palpated this : " It 's hard . " " That 's from doing pushups . You think I 'm big for my age , or just average ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As big as you when you were eleven ? " " Just about . " " How big are you now ? " " Six feet or so . " " How much do you weigh ? " " About one-ninety . " " Did you ever play football ? " " Some , in high school . " " Do you think , will I ever get to be a football player ? " he said wistfully . " I do n't see why not . "  | " That 's my ambition , to be a football player . " lle darted out of the room and was back in no time with a football which he threw at me from the doorway . " Y. A. Tittle , " he said . I caught the ball and said : " Hugh McElhenny . " This struck him as very funny . He laughed until he fell down . Being in position , he did a few pushups . " Stop it . You 're making me tired . " " I never get tired , " he bragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to take a run around the block . " " Do n't tell me . It wears me out . " A car turned into the driveway . The boy struggled to his feet : " That 's Mummy and Daddy now . I 'll tell them you 're here , Mr. Steele . " " My name is Archer . Who 's Mr. Steele ? " " My coach in the Little League . I got you mixed up with him , I guess . " It did n't bother him , but it bothered me . It was a declaration of trust , and I did n't know what I was going to have to do to his mother . She came in alone . Her face hardened and thinned when she saw me : " What do you want ? What are you doing with my son 's football ? " " Holding it . He threw it to me . I 'm holding it . " " We were making like Forty-niners , " the boy said . But the laughter had gone out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " She turned on the boy : " James , your father is in the garage . You can help him bring in the groceries . And take that football with you . " " Here . " I tossed him the ball . He carried it out as if it was made of iron . The door closed behind him . " He 's a likely boy . "  | " A lot you care , coming here to badger me . I talked to the police this morning . I do n't have to talk to you . " " I think you want to , though . " " " I ca n't . My husband  --  he does n't know . " " What does n't he know ? " " Please . " She moved toward me rapidly , heavily , almost as though she was falling , and grasped my arm . " Ron will be coming in any minute . You wo n't force me to talk in front of him ? " " Send him away . " " How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need something from the store . " " But we just came from the store . " " Think of something else . " Her eyes narrowed to two black glittering slits . " Damn you . You come in here disrupting my life . What did I do to bring this down on me ? " " That 's the question that needs answering , Mrs. Math-eson . " " Wo n't you go away and come back later ? " " I have other things to do later . Let 's get this over with . " " I only wish I could . " The back door opened . She pulled away from me . Her face smoothed out and became inert , like the face of someonedying . " Sit down , " she said . " You might as well sit down . " I sat on the edge of an overstuffed chesterfield covered with hard shiny green brocade . Footsteps crossed the kitchen , and paper rustled . A man raised his voice : " Marian , where are you ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the doorway . Matheson was a thin small man in a gray suit who looked about five years younger than his wife . He stared at me through his glasses with the belligerence of his size . It was his wife he spoke to :  | " I did n't know you had a visitor . " " Mr. Archer is Sally Archer 's husband . You 've heard me speak of Sally Archer , Ron . " In spite of his uncomprehendinglook , she rushed on : " I promised to send her a cake for the church supper , and I forgot to bake it . What am I going to do ? " " You 'll have to skip it . " " I ca n't . She 's depending on me . Ron , would you go downtown and bring me a cake for Mr. Archer to take to Sally ? Please ? " " Now ? " he said with disgust . " It 's for tonight . Sally 's waiting for it . " " Let her wait . " " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around that I did n't do my share . " He turned out his hands in resignation . " How big a cake does it have to be ? " " The two-dollar size will do . Chocolate . You know the bakery at the shopping center . " " But that 's way over on the other side of town . " " It 's got to be good , Ron . You do n't want to shame me in front of my friends . " Some of her real feeling was caught in the words . His eyes jabbed at me and returned to her face , searching it : " Listen , Marian , what 's the trouble ? Are you okay ? " " Certainly I 'm okay . " She produced a smile . " Now run along like a good boy and bring me that cake . You can take Jimmy with you , and I 'll have supper ready when you get back . " Matheson went out , slamming the door behind him in protest . I heard his car engine start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well trained . " " Please leave my husband out of this . He does n't deserve trouble . " " Does he know the police were here ? "  | " No , but the neighbors will tell him . And then I 'll have to do some more lying . I hate this lying . " " Stop lying . " " And let him know I 'm mixed up in a murder ? That would be just great . " " Which murder are you talking about ? " She opened her mouth . Her hand flew up to cover it . She forced her hand down to her side and stood very still , like a sentinel guarding her hearth . " Culligan 's ? " I said . " Or the murder of John Brown ? " The name struck her like a blow in the mouth . She was too shaken to speak for a minute . Then she gathered her forces and straightened up and said : " I do n't know any John Brown . " " You said you hated lying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter of 1936 , looking after his wife and baby . " She was silent . I brought out one of my pictures of Anthony Calton and thrust it up to her face : " Do n't you recognize him ? " She nodded resignedly . " I recognize him . It 's Mr. Brown . " " And you worked for him , did n't you ? " " So what ? Working for a person is no crime . " " Murder is the crime we 're talking about . Who killed him , Marian ? Was it Culligan ? " " Who says anybody killed him ? He pulled up stakes and went away . The whole family did . " " Brown did n't go very far , just a foot or two underground . They dug him up last spring , all but his head . His head was missing . Who cut it off , Marian ? " The ugliness rose like smoke in the room , spreading to its far corners , fouling the light at the window . The ugliness entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to find the words that would exorcise it . I said : " I 'll make a bargain with you , and keep it if I can . I don'tp106want to hurt your boy . I 've got nothing against you or your husband . I suspect you 're material witness to a murder . Maybe the law would call it accessory  --  " " No . " She shook her head jerkily . " I had nothing to do with it . " " Maybe not . I 'm not interested in pinning anything on you . If you 'll tell me the whole truth as you know it , I 'll do my best to keep you out of it . But it has to be the whole truth , and I have to have it now . A lot depends on it . " " How could a lot depend , after all these years ? " " Why did Culligan die , after all these years ? I think that the two deaths are connected . I also think that you can tell me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . " What do you think I am , a crystal ball ? " " Stop fooling around , " I said sharply . " We only have a few minutes . If you wo n't talk to me alone , you can talk in front of your husband . " " What if I refuse to talk at all ? " " You 'll be having another visit from the cops . It 'll start here and end up at the courthouse . And everybody west of the Rockies will have a chance to read all about it in the papers . Now talk . " " I need a minute to think . " " You 've had it . Who murdered Brown ? " " I did n't know he was murdered , not for sure . Culligan would n't let me go back to the house after that night . He said the Browns moved on , bag and baggage . He even tried to give me money he said they left for me . " " Where did he get it ? " After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " Did he murder Brown ? " " Not Culligan . He would n't have the nerve . " " Who did ? " " There was another man . It must have been him . "  | " What was his name ? " " I do n't know . " " What did he look like ? " " I hardly remember . I only saw him the once , and it was at night . " Her story was turning vague , and it made me suspicious . " Are you sure the other man existed ? " " Of course he did . " " Prove it . " " He was a jailbird , " she said . " He escaped from San Quentin . He used to belong to the same gang Culligan did . " " What gang is that ? " " I would n't know . It broke up long before I married Culligan . He never talked about his gang days . I was n't interested . " " Let 's get back to this man who broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Culligan must have called him something . " " I do n't remember what . " " Try harder . " She looked toward the window . Her face was drawn in the tarnished light . " Shoulders . I think it was Shoulders . " " No last name ? " " Not that I remember . I do n't think Culligan ever told me his last name . " " What did he look like ? " " He was a big man , dark-haired . I never really saw him , not in the light . " " What makes you think he murdered Brown ? " She answered in a low voice , to keep her house from hearing : " I heard them arguing that night , in the middle of the night . They were sitting out in my car arguing about money . The other man  --  Shoulders  --  said that he 'd knock off Pete , too , if he did n't get his way . I heard him say it.  |p108The  walls of the shack we lived in were paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it cut through the walls like a knife . He wanted all the money for himself , and most of the jewels . " Pete said it was n't fair , that he was the finger man and should have an equal split . He needed money , too , and God knows that he did . He always needed money . He said that a couple of hot rubies were no good to him . That was how I guessed what happened . Little Mrs. Brown had these big red jewels , I always thought they were glass . But they were rubies . " " What happened to the rubies ? " " The other man took them , he must of . Culligan settled for part of the money , I guess . At least he was flush for a while . " " Did you ever ask him why ? " " No . I was afraid . " " Afraid of Culligan ? " " Not him so much . " She tried to go on , but the words stuck in her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to dislodge them . " I was afraid of the truth , afraid he 'd tell me . I did n't want to believe what happened , I guess . That argument I heard outside our house  --  I tried to pretend to myself it was all a dream . I was in love with Culligan in those days . I could n't face my own part in it . " " You mean the fact that you did n't take your suspicions to the police ? " " That would have been bad enough , but I did worse . I was the one responsible for the whole thing . I 've lived with it on my conscience for over twenty years . It was all my fault for not keeping my loud mouth shut . " She gave me an up-from-under look , her eyes burning with pain : " Maybe I ought to be keeping it shut now . " " How were you responsible ? " She hung her head still lower . Her eyes sank out of sightp109under her black brows . " I told Culligan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown kept it in a steel box in his room . I saw it when he paid me . There must have been thousands of dollars . And I had to go and mention it to my hus  --  to Culligan . I would have done better to go and cut my tongue out instead . " She raised her head , slowly , as if she was balancing a weight . " So there you have it . " " Did Brown ever tell you where he got the money ? " " Not really . He made a joke about it  --  said he stole it . But he was n't the type . " " What type was he ? " " Mr. Brown was a gentleman , at least he started out to be a gentleman . Until he married that wife of his . I do n't know what he saw in her outside of a pretty face . She did n't know from nothing , if you ask me . But he knew plenty , he could talk your head off . " She gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! They cut his head off ? " She was n't asking me . She was asking the dark memories flooding up from the basement of her life . " Before death or after , we do n't know which . You say you never went back to the house ? " " I never did . We went back to San Francisco . " " Do you know what happened to the rest of the family , the wife and son ? " She shook her head . " I tried not to think about them . What did happen to them ? " " I 'm not sure , but I think they went east . The indications are they got away safe , at any rate . " " Thank God for that . " She tried to smile , and failed . Her eyes were still intent on the guilty memory . She looked at the walls of her living-room as if they were transparent . " I guess you wonder what kind of a woman I am , that I could run out on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother me . I almost went out of my mind for a while that winter . Ip110used to wake up in the middle of the night and listen to Culligan 's breathing and wish it would stop . But I stuck to him for five more years after that . Then I divorced him . " " And now he 's stopped breathing . " " What do you mean by that ? " " You could have hired a gun to knock him off . He was threatening to make trouble for you . You have a lot to lose . " I did n't believe it , but I wanted to see what she would make of it . Her two hands went to her breasts and grasped them cruelly . " Me ? You think I 'd do that ? " " To keep your husband and son , you would . Did you ? " " No . For God 's sake , no . " " That 's good . " " Why do you say that ? " Her eyes were dull with the sicknessof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you have . " " Do n't do me any favors . " " I 'm going to , though . I 'm going to keep you out of the Culligan case . As for the information you 've given me , I 'm going to use it for private reference only . It would be easier for me if I did n't  --  " " So you want to be paid for your trouble , is that it ? " " Yes , but not in money . I want your confidence , and any other information you can give me . " " But there is n't any more . That 's all there is . " " What happened to Shoulders ? " " I do n't know . He must of got away . I never heard of him again . " " Culligan never mentioned him ? " " No . Honest . " " And you never brought the subject up ? " " No . I was too much of a coward . " A car entered the driveway . She started , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning dusky gray . In thep111yard across the street , red roses burned like coals . She rubbed her eyes with her knuckles , as if she wanted to wipe out all her past experiences , live innocent in an innocent world . The little boy burst through the door . Matheson came at his heels , balancing a cake box in his hands . ' Well , I got the darn thing . " He thrust it into my hands . " That takes care of the church supper . " " Thanks . " " Do n't mention it , " he said brusquely , and turned to his wife : " Is supper ready ? I 'm starved . " She stood on the far side of the room , cut off from him by the ugliness . " I did n't make supper . " " You did n't make it ? What is this ? You said you 'd have it ready when I got home . " Hidden forces dragged at her face , widening her mouth , drawing deep lines between her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran in the furrows of her face . Sobbing , she sat on the edge of the hearth like an urchin on a curb . " Marian ? What 's the mater ? What 's the trouble , kiddie ? " " I 'm not a good wife to you . " Matheson went across the room to her . He sat on the hearth beside her and took her in his arms . She buried her face in his neck . The boy started toward them , and then turned back to me . " Why is Mother crying ? " " People cry . " " I do n't cry , " he said.  |p112I  DROVE back across the ridge toward the last fading light in the sky . On the road that wound down to Luna Bay I passed an old man with a burlap bag on his back . He was one of the old-time hoboes who follow the sun like migratory birds . But the birds fly , and the men walk . The birds mate and nest ; the old men have no nests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and backed up and gave him the cake . " Thank you very kindly . " His mouth was a rent in shaggy fur . He put the cake in his bag . It was a cheap gift , so I gave him a dollar to go with it . " Do you want a ride into town ? " " No , thank you very kindly . I 'd smell up your car . " He walked away from me with a long , slow , swinging purposeless stride , lost in a dream of timeless space . When I passed him , he did n't raise his bearded head . He was like a moving piece of countryside on the edge of my headlight beam . I had fish and chips at a greasy spoon and went to the sheriff 's substation . It was eight by the clock on the wall above Mungan 's desk . He looked up from his paperwork : " Where you been ? The Brown kid 's been looking for you . " " I want to see him . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dineen 's house . They 're pretty good friends . He told me that the doc is teaching him how to play chess . That game was always a little over my head . Give me a hand of poker any time . " I went around the end of the counter and complied with his request , in a way :  | " I 've been doing some asking around . A couple of things came up that ought to interest you . You say you knew some of the hoods in these parts , back in the early thirties . Does the name Culligan mean anything to you ? " " Yeah . Happy Culligan , they called him . He was in the Red Horse mob . " " Who were his friends ? " " Let 's see . " Mungan stroked his massive chin . " There was Rossi , Shoulders Nelson , Lefty Dearborn  --  all of them Lempi 's guns . Culligan was more the operator type , but he liked to hang around with the guns . " " What about Shoulders Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bunch . Even his buddies were afraid of him . " A trace of his boyhood admirationshowed in Mungan 's eyes . " I saw him beat Culligan to a pulp one night . They both wanted the same girl . " " What girl ? " " One of the girls upstairs at the Red Horse . I did n't know her name . Nelson shacked up with her for a while , I heard . " " What did Nelson look like ? " " He was a big man , almost as big as me . The women went for him , he must have been good-looking to them . I never thought so , though . He was a mean-looking bastard , with a long sad face and mean eyes . Him and Rossi and Dearborn got sent up the same time as Lempi . " " To Alcatraz ? " " Lempi went there , when the Government took it over . But the others took the fall on a larceny charge . Highjacking . The three of them went to San Quentin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't keep any track of them . I was n't in law enforcementat the time . Where is all this supposed to be leading ? " " Shoulders Nelson may be the killer you want , " I said . " Would your Redwood City office have a dossier on him ? " " I doubt that . He has n't been heard of around here inp114more than twenty-five years . It was a state case , anyway . " " Then Sacramento should have it . You could have RedwoodCity teletype them . " Mungan spread his hands on the desk-top and stood up , wagging his big head slowly from side to side . " If all you got is a hunch , you ca n't use official channels to test it out for you . " " I thought we were co-operating . " " I am . You 're not . I 've been doing the talking , you 've been doing the listening . And this has been going on for quite some time . " " I told you Nelson 's probably our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " By itself , it does n't do anything for me . " " It could if you let it . Try querying Sacramento . " " What 's your source of information ? " " I ca n't tell you . " " Like that , eh ? " " I 'm afraid so . " Mungan looked down at me in a disappointed way . Not surprised , just disappointed . We had had the beginning of a beautiful friendship , but I had proved unworthy . " I hope you know what you 're doing . " " I hope I do . You think about this Nelson angle . It 's worth going into . You could earn yourself some very nice pub-licity . " " I do n't give a damn about publicity . " " Good for you . " " And you can go to hell . " I did n't blame him for blowing off . It 's tough to live with a case for half a year and then watch it elope with a casual pickup . But I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even want to . I went outside the counter and sat down on a wooden bench against the wall . Mungan resumed his placep115at his desk and avoided looking at me . I sat there like a penitent while the minute hand of the clock took little pouncing bites of eternity . At eight-thirty-five Mungan got up and made an elaborate show of discovering me : " You still here ? " " I 'm waiting for a friend  --  a lawyer from down south . He said he 'd be here by nine o'clock . " " What for ? To help you to pick my brains ? " " I do n't know why you 're browned off , Mungan . This is a big case , bigger than you realize . It 's going to take more than one of us to handle it . " " What makes it so big ? " " The people involved , the money , and the names . At this end we have the Red Horse gang , or what 's left of it ; at the other end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's their lawyer I 'm expecting , a man named Sable . " " So what ? I get down on my knees ? I give everybody an even shake , treat ' em all alike . " " Mr. Sable may be able to identify those bones of yours . " Mungan could n't repress his interest . " He the one you talked to on the phone ? " " He 's the one . " " You 're working on this case for him ? " " He hired me . And he may be bringing some medical data that will help us identify the remains . " Mungan went back to his paperwork . After a few minutes , he said casually : " If you 're working for a lawyer , it lets you off the hook . It gives you the same rights of privacy a lawyer has . You probably would n't know that , but I 've made quite a study of the law . " " It 's news to me , " I lied . He said magnanimously : " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all the fine points of the law . "  |p116His  pride and his integrity were satisfied . He called the county courthouse and asked them to get a rundown on Nelson from Sacramento . Gordon Sable walked in at five minutes to nine . He had on a brown topcoat and a brown Homburg , and a pair of yellow pigskin driving gloves . The lids of his gray eyes were slightly inflamed . His mouth was drawn down at the corners , and lines of weariness ran from them to the wings of his nose . " You made a quick trip , " I said . " Too quick to suit me . I did n't get away until nearly three o'clock . " He looked around the small office as if he doubted that the trip had been worth making . Mungan rose expectantly . " Mr. Sable , Deputy Mungan . " The two men shook hands , each of them appraising the other . " Glad to meet you , " Mungan said . " Mr. Archer tells me you 've got some medical information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That may be . " Sable glanced sideways at me . " How much more detail did you go into ? " " Just that , and the fact that the family is important . We 're not going to be able to keep them anonymous from here on in . " I realize that , " he snapped . " But let 's get the **25;728;TOOLONG first , if we can . Before I left , I talked to the doctor who set the broken arm . IIe did have X-ray pictures taken , but unfortunately they do n't survive . He has his written record , however , and he gave me the  --  ah  --  specificationsof the fracture . " Sable produced a folded piece of paper from an inner pocket . " It was a clean break in the right humerus , two inches above the joint . The boy sustainedit falling off a horse . " Mungan said : " It figures . "  |p117Sable  turned to him . " May we see the exhibit in question ? " Mungan went into the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in an undertone . " At a friend 's house , playing chess . I 'll take you to him when we finish here . " " " Tony was a chess-player . Do you really think he 's Tony 's son ? " " I do n't know . I 'm waiting to have my mind made up for me . " " By the evidence of the bones ? " " Partly . I 've got hold of another piece of evidence that fits in . Brown has been identified from one of Tony Galton 's pictures . " " You did n't tell me that before . " " I did n't know it before . " " Who 's your witness ? " " A woman named Matheson in Redwood City . She 's Culligan 's ex-wife and Galton 's ex-nurse . I 've made a commitmentto keep her name out of the police case . " " Is that wise ? " Sable 's voice was sharp and unpleasant . " Wise or not , it 's the way it is . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut it short . The bones rattled in his evidence box . He hoisted it onto the counter and raised the lid . Sable looked down at John Brown 's leavings . His face was grave . Mungan picked out the arm bone and laid it on the counter . He went to his desk and came back with a steel footrule . The break was exactly two inches from the end . Sable was breathing quickly . He spoke in repressed excitement : " It looks very much as if we 've found Tony Calton . Why is the skull missing ? What was done to him ? " Mungan told him what he knew . On the way to the Dineen house I told Sable the rest of it . " I have to congratulate you , Archer . You certainly get re-sults. "  | " They fell into my lap . It 's one of the things that made me suspicious . Too many coincidences came together  --  the Culligan murder , the Brown-Galton murder , the BrownGaltonboy turning up , if that 's who he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been planned to come out this way . There are mobsters involved , remember . Those boys look a long way ahead sometimes , and they 're willing to wait for their payoff . " " Payoff ? " " The Galton money . I think the Culligan killing was a gang killing . I think it was no accident that Culligan came to work for you three months ago . Your house was a perfect hide-out for him , and a place where he could watch developments in the Galton family . " " For what possible purpose ? " " My thinking has n't got that far , " I said . " But I 'm reasonablycertain that Culligan did n't go there on his own . " " Who sent him ? " " That 's the question . " After a pause , I said : " How is Mrs. Sable , by the way ? " " Not good . I had to put her in a nursing home . I could n't leave her by herself at home . " " I suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The doctors seem to think it 's what triggered her breakdown . But she 's had emotional trouble before . " " What sort of emotional trouble ? " " I 'd just as soon not go into it , " he said bleakly.  |p119DR  . DINEEN came to the door in an ancient smoking-jacket made of red velvet which reminded me of the plush in old railway coaches . His wrinkled face was set in a frown of concentration . He looked at me im-patiently : " What is it ? " " I think we 've identified your skeleton . " " Really ? How ? " " Through the mended break in the arm bone . Dr. Dineen , this is Mr. Sable . Mr. Sable 's an attorney representing the dead man 's family . " " Who were his family ? " Sable answered : " His true name was Anthony Galton . His mother is Mrs. Henry Galton of Santa Teresa . " " You do n't say . I used to see her name on the society pages . She cut quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , " Sable said . " She 's an old woman now . " We all grow older , do n't we ? But come in , gentlemen . " He stood back to let us enter . I turned to him in the hall-way : " Is John Brown with you ? " " He is , yes . I believe he was trying to locate you earlier in the evening . At the moment he 's in my office studying the chessboard . Much good may it do him . I propose to beat him in six more moves . " " Can you give us a minute , Doctor , by ourselves ? " " If it 's important , and I gather it is . " He steered us into a dining-room furnished in beautifulp120old mahogany . Light from a yellowing crystal chandelier fell on the dark wood and on the sterling tea set which stood in geometrical order on the tall buffet . The room recalled the feeling I 'd had that morning , that the doctor 's house was an enclave of the solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed us on either side of him . Sable leaned forward across the corner of the table . The events of the day and the one before it had honed his profile sharp : " Will you give me your opinion of the young man 's moral character ? " " I entertain him in my house . That ought to answer your question . " " " You consider him a friend ? " " I do , yes . I do n't make a practice of entertaining casual strangers . At my age you ca n't afford to waste your time on second-rate people . " " Does that imply that he 's a first-rate person ? " " It would seem to . " The doctor 's smile was slow , and almostindistinguishable from his frown . " At least he has the makings . You do n't ask much more from a boy of twenty-two . " " How long have you known him ? " " All his life , if you count our initial introduction . Mr. Archer may have told you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain this is the same boy that you brought into the world ? " " I have no reason to doubt it . " " Would you swear to it , Doctor ? " " If necessary . " " It may be necessary . The question of his identity is a highly important one . A very great deal of money is in-volved . " The old man smiled , or frowned . " Forgive me if I 'm notp121overly impressed . Money is only money , after all . I do n't believeJohn is particularly hungry for money . As a matter of fact , this development will be quite a blow to him . He came here in the hope of finding his father , alive . " " If he qualifies for a fortune , " Sable said , " it ought to be some comfort to him . Were his parents legally married , do you know ? " " It happens that I can answer that question , in the affirmative . John has been making some inquiries . He discovered just last week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benicia , by civil ceremony , in September 1936 . That seems to make him legitimate , by a narrow margin . " Sable sat in silence for a minute . He looked at Dineen like a prosecutor trying to weigh the credibility of a witness . " Well , " the old man said . " Are you satisfied ? I do n't wish to appear inhospitable , but I 'm an early riser , and it happens to be my bedtime . " " There are one or two other things , if you 'll bear with me , Doctor . I 'm wondering , for instance , just how you happen to be so close to the boy 's affairs . " " I choose to be , " Dineen said abruptly . " Why ? " The doctor looked at Sable with faint dislike . " My motives are no concern of yours , Counselor . The young man knocked on my door a month ago , looking for some trace of his family . Naturally I did my best to help him . He has a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If he can prove that he 's a member of it . " " There seems to be no question of that . I think you 're being unnecessarily hard on him , and I see no reason why you should continue in that vein . Certainly there 's no indicationthat he 's an impostor . He has his birth certificate , which proves the facts of his birth . My name is on it as attendingphysician . It 's why he came to me in the first place . "  | " Birth certificates are easy to get , " I said . " You can write in , pay your money , and take your choice . " " I suppose you can , if you 're a cheat and a scoundrel . I resent the implication that this boy is . " " Please do n't . " Sable moderated his tone . " As Mrs. Galton'sattorney , it 's my duty to be skeptical of these claims . " " John has been making no claims . " " Perhaps not yet . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as financial . Mrs. Galton is in uncertain health . I do n't intend to present her with a situationthat 's likely to blow up in her face . " " I do n't believe that 's the case here . You asked me for my opinion , and now you have it . But no human situation is entirelypredictable , is it ? " The old man leaned forward to get up . His bald scalp gleamed like polished stone in the light from the chandelier . " You 'll be wanting to talk to John , I suppose . I 'll tell him you 're here . " He left the room and came back with the boy . John was wearing flannel slacks and a gray sweater over an openneckedshirt . He looked like the recent college graduate that he was supposed to be , but he was n't at ease in the situation . His eyes shifted from my face to Sable 's . Dineen stood beside him in an almost protective posture . " This is Mr. Sable , " he said in a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teresa , and he 's very much interested in you . " Sable stepped forward and gave him a brisk handshake . " I 'm glad to meet you . " " Glad to meet you . " His gray eyes matched Sable 's in watchfulness . " I understand you know who my father is . " " Was , John , " I said . " We 've identified those bones at the station , pretty definitely . They belonged to a man named Anthony Galton . The indications are that he was your father . " " But my father 's name was John Brown . "  | " He used that name . It started out as a pen name , apparently . " I looked at the lawyer beside me . " We can take it for granted , ca n't we , that Galton and Brown were the same man , and that he was murdered in 1936 ? " " It appears so . " Sable laid a restraining hand on my arm . " I wish you 'd let me handle this . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , who looked as if he had n't absorbed the fact of his father 's death . The doctor laid an arm across his shoulders : " I 'm sorry about this , John . I know how much it means to you . " " It 's funny , it does n't seem to mean a thing . I never knew my father . It 's simply words , about a stranger . " " I 'd like to talk to you in private , " Sable said . " Where can we do that ? " " In my room , I suppose . What are we going to talk about ? " " You . " He lived in a workingmen 's boardinghouse on the other side of town . It was a ramshackle frame house standing among others which had known better days . The landlady intercepted us at the front door . She was a large-breasted Portuguese woman with rings in her ears and spice on her breath . Something in the boy 's face made her say : " Whatsamatter , Johnny ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorgello , " he said with forced lightness . " These men are friends of mine . Is it all right if I take them up to my room ? " " It 's your room , you pay rent . I cleaned it up today for you , real nice . Come right in , gentlemen , " she said royally . Not so royally , she jostled the boy as he passed her in the doorway . " Lift up the long face , Johnny . You look like judgmentday . " His room was a small bare cubicle on the second floor atp124the rear . I guessed that it had been a servant 's room in the days when the house was a private residence . Torn places and stains among the faded roses of the wallpaper hinted at a long history of decline . The room was furnished with an iron cot covered by an army blanket , a stained pine chest of drawers topped by a clouded mirror , a teetery wardrobe , a kitchen chair standing beside a table . In spite of the books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead man Culligan . Perhaps it was the smell , compound of hidden dirt and damp and old grim masculine odors . My mind skipped to Mrs. Galton 's grandiose estate . It would be quite a leap from this place to that . I wondered if the boy was going to make it . He was standing by the single window , looking at us with a sort of defiance . This was his room , his bearing seemed to say , and we could take it or leave it . He lifted the kitchen chair and turned it away from the table : " Sit down if you like . One of you can sit on the bed . " " I 'd just as soon stand , thanks , " Sable said . " I had a long drive up here , and I 'm going to have to drive back tonight . " The boy said stiffly : " I 'm sorry to put you to all this trou-ble . " " Nonsense . This is my job , and there 's nothing personal about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May I have a look at it ? " " Certainly . " He pulled out the top drawer of the chest of drawers and produced a folded document . Sable put on horn-rimmed spectacles to read it . I read it over his shoulder . It stated that John Brown , Jr. , had been born on Bluff Road in San Mateo County on December 2 , 1936 ; father , John Brown ; mother , Theodora Gavin Brown ; attending physician , Dr. George T. Dineen.  |p125Sable  glanced up , snatching off his glasses like a politi-cian : " You realize this document means nothing in itself ? Anyonecan apply for a birth certificate , any birth certificate . " " This one happens to be mine , sir . " " I notice it was issued only last March . Where were you in March ? " " I was still in Ann Arbor . I lived there for over five years . " " Going to the University all that time ? " I asked . " Most of it . I attended high school for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the University . I graduated this spring . " He paused , and caught with his teeth at his full lower lip . " I suppose you 'll be checking all this , so I might as well explain that I did n't go to school under my own name . " " Why ? Did n't you know your own name ? " " Of course I did . I always have . If you want me to go into the circumstances , I will . " " I think that 's very much to be desiderated , " Sable said . The boy picked up one of the books from the table . Its title was Dramas of Modernism . He opened it to the flyleaf and showed us the name " John Lindsay " written in ink there . " That was the name I used , John Lindsay . The Christian name was my own , of course . The surname belonged to Mr. Lindsay , the man who took me into his home . " " He lived in Ann Arbor ? " Sable said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy 's tone was faintly sardonic . " I lived there with him for several years . His full name was Mr. Gabriel R. Lindsay . He was a teacher and counselor at the high school . " " Is n't it rather odd that you used his name ? " " I did n't think so , under the circumstances . The circumstanceswere odd  --  that 's putting it mildly  --  and Mr. Lind/say was the one who took a real interest in my case . " " Your case ? " The boy smiled wryly . " I was a case , all right . I 've come a long way in five years , thanks to Mr. Lindsay . I was a mess when I showed up at that high school  --  a mess in more ways than one . I 'd been two days on the road , and I did n't have decent clothes , or anything . Naturally they would n't let me in . I did n't have a school record , and I would n't tell them my name . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd drag me back to Ohio and put me in training-school . They did that to some of the boys who ran away from the orphanage . Besides , the superintendentdid n't like me . " " The superintendent of the orphanage ? " " Yes . His name was Mr. Merriweather . " " What was the name of the orphanage ? " " Crystal Springs . It 's near Cleveland . They did n't call it an orphanage . They called it a Home . Which did n't make it any more homelike . " " You say your mother put you there ? " I said . " When I was four . " " Do you remember your mother ? " " Of course . I remember her face , especially . She was very pale and thin , with blue eyes . I think she must have been sick . She had a bad cough . I-ier voice was husky , very low and soft . I remember the last thing she ever said to me : Your daddy 's name was John Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what or where California was , but I held on to the word . You can see why I had to come here , finally . " His voice seemed to have the resonance of his life behind it . Sable was unimpressed by his emotion . " Where did she say that to you ? " " In the Superintendent 's office , when she left me there.  |p127She  promised to come back for me , but she never did . I do n't know what happened to her . " " But you remember her words from the age of four ? " " I was bright for my age , " he answered matter-of-factly . " I 'm bright , and I 'm not ashamed of it . It stood me in good stead when I was trying to get into the high school in Ann Arbor . " " Why did you pick Ann Arbor ? " " I heard it was a good place to get an education . The teachers in the Home were a couple of ignorant bullies . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aptitude test , and he decided that I deserved an education , even if I did n't have any transcript . He put up quite a battle for me , getting me into the high school . And then he had to fight the welfare people . They wanted to put me in Juvenile , or find a foster-home for me . Mr. Lindsay convinced them that his home would do , even if he did n't have a wife . He was a widower . " " He sounds like a good man , " I said . " He was the best , and I ought to know . I lived with him for nearly four years . I looked after the furnace , mowed the lawn in the summer , worked around the house to pay for my board and room . But board and room was the least of what he gave me . I was a little bum when he took me in . He made a decent person out of me . " He paused , and his eyes looked past us , thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no right today , to tell you that I never had a father . Gabe Lindsay was a father to me . " " I 'd like to meet him , " I said . " So that you can check up on me ? " " Not necessarily . Do n't take all this so hard , John . As Mr. Sable said , there 's nothing personal about it . It 's our business to get the facts . " " It 's too late to get them from Mr. Lindsay . Mr. Lindsayp128died the winter before last . He was good to me right up to the end , and past it . He left me enough money to finish my studies . " " How much did he leave you ? " Sable said . " Two thousand dollars . I still have a little of it left . " " What did he die of ? " " Pneumonia . He died in the University Hospital in Ann Arbor . I was with him when he died . You can check that . Next question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to mask his feeling . I thought if his feeling was artificial , he did n't need the Galton money : he could make his fortune as an actor . " What motivated you to come here to Luna Bay ? " Sable said . " It could n't have been pure coincidence . " " Who said it was ? " Under the pressure of cross-questioning , the boy 's poise was breaking down . " I had a right to come here . I was born here , was n't I ? " " Were you ? " " You just saw my birth certificate . " " How did you get hold of it ? " " I wrote to Sacramento . Is there anything wrong with that ? I gave them my birthdate , and they were able to tell me where I was born . " " Why the sudden interest in where you were born ? " " It was n't a sudden interest . Ask any orphan how important it is to him . The only sudden part of it was my bright idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me before . " " How did you know your birthdate ? " " My mother must have told the orphanage people . They always gave me a birthday present on December second . " He grinned wryly . " Winter underwear . " Sable smiled , too , in spite of himself . He waved his handp129in front of his face , as if to dissipate the tension in the room : " Are you satisfied , Archer ? " " I am for now . We 've all had a long day . Why do n't you lay over for the night ? " " I ca n't . I have an important probate coming up at ten tomorrow morning . Before that , I have to talk to the Judge in his chambers . " He turned suddenly to the boy : " Do you drive a car ? " " I do n't have one of my own , but I can drive . " " How would you like to drive me to Santa Teresa ? Now . " " To stay ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother will be eager to see you . " " But Mr. Turnell 's counting on me at the station . " " He can get himself another boy , " I said . " You better go , John . You 're due for a big change , and this is the beginning of it . " " I 'll give you ten minutes to pack , " Sable said . The boy seemed dazed for a minute . He looked around the walls of the mean little room as if he hated to leave it . Perhaps he was afraid to make the big leap . " Come on , " Sable said . " Snap into it . " John shook himself out of his apathy , and dragged an old leather suitcase from the wardrobe . We stood and watched him pack his meager belongings : a suit , a few shirts and socks , shaving gear , a dozen books , his precious birth certificate . I wondered if we were doing him a favor . The Calton household had hot and cold running money piped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . Like any other commodity , it had to be paid for.  |p130I  SAT up late in my motel room , making notes on John Brown 's story . It was n't a likely story , on the face of it . His apparent sincerity made it plausible ; that , and the fact that it could easily be checked . Some time in the course of the interview I 'd made a moral bet with myself that John Brown was telling the truth . John Galton , that is . In the morning I mailed my notes to my office in Hollywood . Then I paid a visit to the sheriff 's substation . A young deputy with a crewcut was sitting at Mungan 's desk . " Yes sir ? " " Is Deputy Mungan anywhere around ? " " Sorry , he 's off duty . If you 're Mr. Archer , he left a messagefor you . " He took a long envelope out of a drawer and handed it across the counter . It contained a hurried note written on yellow scratch-pad paper : R.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to S.F. docks in twenties . Assault with intent , nolle-prossed . Lempi gang enforcer 1928 on . Arrested suspicionmurder 1930 , habeas-corpused . Convicted grand theft 1932 , sentenced " Q. " Attempted escape 1933 , extended sentence . Escaped December 1936 , never apprehended . Mungan . I walked across the street to the hotel and phoned Roy Lemberg 's hotel , the Sussex Arms . The desk clerk answered : " Sussex Arms . Mr. Farnsworth speaking . "  | " This is Archer . Is Lemberg there ? " " Who did you say it was ? " " Archer . I gave you ten dollars yesterday . Is Lemberg there ? " " Mr. and Mrs. Lemberg both checked out . " " When ? " " Yesterday aft , right after you left . " " Why did n't I see them go ? " " Maybe because they went out the back way . They did n't even leave a forwarding address . But Lemberg made a long-distance call before they took off . A call to Reno . " " Who did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . Lemberg used to work for him , I think . " " And that 's all there is ? " " That 's all , " Farnsworth said . " I hope it 's what you want . " I drove across country to International Airport , turned in my rented car , and caught a plane to Reno . By noon I was parking another rented car in front of Generous Joe 's lot . A huge billboard depicted a smiling Santa Claus type scattering silver dollars . The lot had a kiosk on one corner , and a row of late-model cars fronting for half an acre of clunks . A big corrugated metal shed with a Cars Painted sign on the wall stood at the rear of the lot . An eager young man with a rawhide tie cantered out of the kiosk almost before I 'd brought my car to a halt . He patted and stroked the fender : " Nice . Very nice . Beautiful condition , clean inside and out . Depending on your equity , you can trade up and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail . I just rented this crate . " He gulped , performed a mental back somersault , and landed on his feet : " So why pay rent ? On our terms , you can own a car for less money . " " You would n't be Generous Joe ? "  | " Mr. Culotti 's in the back . You want to talk to him ? " I said I did . He waved me toward the shed , and yelled : " Hey , Mr. Culotti , customer ! " A gray-haired man came out , looking cheaply gala in an ice-cream suit . His face was swarthy and pitted like an Epstein bronze , and its two halves did n't quite match . When I got closer to him , I saw that one of his brown eyes was made of glass . He looked permanently startled . " Mr. Culotti ? " " That 's me . " He smiled a money smile . " What can I do for you ? " A trace of Mediterranean accent added feminine endings to some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . " " That 's right , he used to work for me , wanted his old job back . Nix . " A gesture of his spread hand swept Lemberg into the dust-bin . " Is he back in Reno ? I 'm trying to locate him . " Culotti picked at his nose and looked wise , in a startled way . He smiled expansively , and put a fatherly arm around my back . " Come in , we 'll talk . " He propelled me toward the door . Hissing sounds came from the shed , and the sweet anesthetic odor of sprayed paint . Culotti opened the door and stepped back . A goggled man with a paint-gun turned from his work on a blue car . I was trying to recognize him , when Culotti 's shoulder caught me like a trunk-bumper in the small of the back . I staggered toward the goggled man . The paint-gun hissed in his hands . A blue cloud stung my eyes . In the burning blue darkness , I recalled that the room clerk Farnsworth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sap 's soft explosion against the back of my head . I glissaded down blue slopes of pain to a hole which opened for me . Later there was talking.  | " Better wash out his eyes , " the first gravedigger said . " We do n't want to blind him . " " Let him go blind , " the second gravedigger said . " Teach him a lesson . I got a hook in the eye . " " Did it teach you a lesson , Blind-eye ? Do what I tell you . " I heard Culotti breathe like a bull . He spat , but made no answer . My hands were tied behind me . My face was on cement . I tried to blink . My eyelids were stuck tight . The fear of blindness is the worst fear there is . It crawled on my face and entered my mouth . I wanted to beg them to save my eyes . A persistent bright speck behind my eyes stared me down and shamed me into continued silence . Liquid gurgled in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't call me that . " " Why not ? You 're a blind-eye greaseball , hamburger that used to be a muscle . " This voice was light and featureless , without feeling , almost without meaning . " You got any olive oil ? " " At home , plenty . " " Go and get it . I 'll keep store . " My consciousness must have lapsed . Oil ran on my face like tears . I thought of a friend named Angelo who made his own oil from the olives he grew on his hillside in the Valley . The Maffia had killed his father . A face came into blurred focus , Culotti 's face , hanging slack-mouthed over me . I twisted from my side onto my back , and lashed at him with both feet . One heel caught him under the chin , and he went down . Something bounced and rolled on the floor . Then he stood one-eyed over me , bleeding at the mouth . He stamped my head back down into earthy darkness . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eve/ping . Somebody had awakened me with his snoring . I listened to the snoring for a while . It stopped when I held my breath and started again when I let my breath out . For a long time I missed the significance of this . There were too many other interesting things to do and think about . The staring speck was back again in the center of my mind . It moved , and my hands moved with it . They felt my face . It bored me . Ruins always bored me . I was lying in a room . The room had walls . There was a window in one of the walls . Snow-capped mountains rose against a yellow sky which darkened to green , then blue . Twilight hung like blue smoke in the room . I sat up ; springs creaked under me . A man I had n't noticedmoved away from the wall he 'd been leaning on . I dropped my feet to the floor and turned to face him , slowly and carefully , so as not to lose my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black curls tumblingover his forehead . One of his arms was in a sling . The other arm had a gun at the end of it . His hot eyes and the cold eye of the gun triangulated my breastbone . " Hello , Tommy , " I tried to say . It came out : " Huddo , Tawy . " My mouth contained ropes of blood . I tried to spit them out . That started a chain-reaction which flung me back on the bed retching and cawing . Tommy Lemberg stood and watched me . He said when I was still : " Mr. Schwartz is waiting to talk to you . You want to clean up a little ? " " Wheh do I do dat ? " I said in my inimitable patois . " There 's a bathroom down the hall . Think you can walk ? " " I can walk . " But I had to lean on the wall to reach the bathroom . Tommy Lemberg stood and watched me wash my face and gargle . I tried to avoid looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , when I was drying my face . Onep135of my front teeth was broken off short . My nose resembled a boiled potato . All of this made me angry . I moved on Tommy . He stepped back into the doorway . I lost my footing and fell to my knees , took the barrel of his gun in the nape of my neck . Pain went through me so large and dull it scared me . I got up , supporting myself on the sink . Tommy was grinning in an excited way . " Do n't do things like that . I do n't want to hurt you . " " Or Culligan , either , I bet . " I was talking better now , but my eyes were n't focusing properly . " Culligan ? Who he ? I never heard of any Culligan . " " And you 've never been in Santa Teresa ? " " Where 's that ? " He ushered me to the end of the corridor and down a flight of steps into a big dim room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the darkening sky . I recognized the mountains west of Reno . Tommy turned on lights which blotted them out . He moved around the room as if he was at home there . I suppose it was the living-room of Otto Schwartz 's house , but it was more like the lobby of a hotel or the recreation room of an institution . The furniture stood around in impersonalgroupings , covered with plastic so that nothing could harm it . An antique bar and a wall of bottles took up one whole end . A jukebox , an electric player piano , a roulettelayout , and several slot machines stood against the rear wall . " You might as well sit down . " Tommy waved his gun at a chair . I sat down and closed my eyes , which still were n't focusing . Everything I looked at had a double outline . I was afraid of concussion . I was having a lot of fears . Tommy turned on the player piano . It started to tinkle out a tune about a little Spanish town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding the gun in his hand . He did n't seem to know what to do with himself . I concentrated on wishing that he would put his gun away and give me some kind of chance at him . He never would , though . He loved holding the gun . He held it different ways , posturing in front of his reflection in the window . I began to draft a mental letter to my congressman advocating legislationprohibiting the manufacture of guns except for militarypurposes . Mr. J. Edgar Hoover entered the room at this point . He must have been able to read minds , because he said that he approved of my plan and intended to present it to the President . I felt my forehead . It was hot and dry , like a heatingpad . Mr. Hoover faded away . The player piano went on hammering out the same tune : music to be delirious by . The man who came in next radiated chill from green glacial eyes . He had a cruel nose and under it the kind of mouth that smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had a well-sustained tan and a lean quick body . He wore a light fedora and a topcoat . So did the man who moved a step behind him and toweredhalf a foot over him . This one had the flat impervious eyes , the battered face and pathological nervelessness of an old-fashioned western torpedo . When his boss paused in front of me , he stood to one side in canine watchfulness . Tommy moved up beside him , like an apprentice . " You 're quite a mess . " Schwartz 's voice was chilly , too , and very soft , expecting to be listened to . " I 'm Otto Schwartz , in case you do n't know . I got no time to waste on two-bit private eyes . I got other things on my mind . " " What kind of things have you got on it ? Murder ? " He tightened up . Instead of hitting me , he took off his hat and threw it to Tommy . His head was completely bald . He put his hands in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the curve of his nose at me :  | " I was giving you the benefit , that you got in over your head without knowing . What 's going to happen , you go on like this , talk about murder , crazy stuff like that ? " He wagged his head solemnly from side to side . " Lake Tahoe is very deep . You could take a long dive , no Aqualung , concrete on the legs . " " You could sit in a hot seat , no cushion , electrodes on the bald head . " The big man took a step toward me , watching Schwartz with a doggy eye , and lunged around with his big shoulders . Schwartz surprised me by laughing , rather tinnily : " You are a brave young man . I like you . I wish you no harm . What do you suggest ? A little money , and that 's that ? " " A little murder . Murder everybody . Then you can be the bigshot of the world . " " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth pursed suddenly and curiously , like a wrinkled old wound : " I take insults from nobody ! And nobody steals from me . " " Did Culligan steal from you ? Is that why you ordered him killed ? " Schwartz looked down at me some more . His eyes had dark centers . I thought of the depths of Tahoe , and poor drowned Archer with concrete on his legs . I was in a susceptiblemood , and fighting it . Tommy Lemberg spoke up : " Can I say something , Mr. Schwartz ? I did n't knock the guy off . The cops got it wrong . He must of fell down on the knife and stabbed himself . " " Yah ! Moron ! " Schwartz turned his contained fury on Tommy : " Go tell that to the cops . Just leave me out of it , please . " " They would n't believe me , " he said in a misunderstood whine . " They 'd pin it on me , just because I tried to defend myself . I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shut up ! Shut up ! " Schwartz spread one hand on top ofp138his head and pulled at imaginary hair . " Why is there no intelligenceleft in the world ? All morons ! " " The intelligent ones would n't touch your rackets with a ten-foot pole . " " I heard enough out of you . " He jerked his head at the big man , who started to take off his coat : " Want me to work him over , Mr. Schwartz ? " It was the light and meaningless voice that had argued with Culotti . It lifted me out of my chair . Because Schwartz was handy , I hit him in the stomach . He jackknifed , and went down gasping . It does n't take much to make me happy , and that gave me a happy feeling which lasted through the first three or four minutes of the beating . Then the big man 's face began to appear in red snatches . When the light in the room failed entirely , the bright staringspeck in my mind took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinny little jokes : " Just promise to forget it , that will be that . " " All you got ta do , give me your word . I 'm a man of my word , you 're another . " " Back to L.A. , that 's all you got ta do . No questions asked , no harm done . " The bright speck stood like a nail in my brain . It would n't let me let go of the room . I cursed it , but it would n't go away . It wrote little luminous remarks on the red pounding darkness : This is it . You take a stand . Then it was a light surging away from me like the light of a ship . I swam for it , but it rose away , hung in the dark heaven still as a star . I let go of the pounding room , and swung from it up and over the black mountains.  |p139I  CAME to early next morning in the accident ward of the Reno hospital . When I had learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of detectivesasked me who took my wallet . I did n't bother disturbingtheir assumption that I was a mugging victim . Anything I told them about Schwartz would be wasted words . Besides , I needed Schwartz . The thought of him got me through the first bad days , when I doubted from time to time that I would be very active in the future . Everythingwas still fuzzy at the edges . I got very tired of fuzzy nurses and earnest young fuzzy doctors asking me how my head felt . By the fourth day , though , my vision was clear enough to read some of yesterday 's newspapers which the voluntary aides brought around for the ward patients . There was hardwarein the sky , and dissension on earth . A special dispatch in the back pages told how a real-life fairy-tale had reached its happy ending when the long-lost John Galton was restored to the bosom of his grandmother , the railroad and oil widow . In the accompanying photograph , John himself was wearing a new-looking sports jacket and a world-is-myoystergrin . This spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was starting to get around . One morning after my Cream of Wheat I sneaked out to the nurses ' station and put in a collectcall to Santa Teresa . I had time to tell Gordon Sable where I was , before the head nurse caught me and marched me back to the ward . Sable arrived while I was eating my **28;755;TOOLONG . He waved a checkbook . Before I knew it I was in a private room with a bottle of Old Forester which Sable had brought me . I sat up late with him , drinking highballs through a glass tube and talking through my remaining teeth like a gangster in very early sound . " You 're going to need a crown on that tooth , " Sable said comfortingly . " Also , - plastic surgery on the nose . Do you have any hospital insurance ? " " No . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't commit Mrs. Calton . " Then he took another look at me , and his manner softened : " Well , yes , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwrite the expense , even though you did exceed your instructions . " " That 's mighty white of you and her . " But the words did n't come out ironic . It had been a bad eight days . " Does n't she give a good goddam about who murdered her son ? And what about Culligan ? " " The police are working on both cases , do n't worry . " " They 're the same case . The cops are sitting on their tails . Schwartz put the fix in . " Sable shook his head . " You 're way off in left field , Lew . " " The hell I am . Tommy Lemberg 's his boy . Have they arrested Tommy ? " " He dropped out of sight . Do n't let it ride you . You 're a willing man , but you ca n't take on responsibility for all the trouble in the world . Not in your present condition , any-way . " " I 'll be on my feet in another week . Sooner . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was full of stormy optimism . " Give me another week after that and I 'll break the case wide open for you . " " I hope so , Lew . But do n't take too much on yourself . You 've been hurt , and naturally your feelings are a bit ex-aggerated . " He was sitting directly under the light , but his face wasp141getting fuzzy . I leaned out of bed and grabbed his shoulder . " Listen , Sable , I ca n't prove it , but I can feel it . That Galtonboy is a phony , part of a big conspiracy , with the Organizationbehind it . " " I think you 're wrong . I 've spent hours on his story . It checks out . And Mrs. Galton is quite happy , for the first time in many years . " " I 'm not . " He rose , and pushed me gently back against the pillows . I was still as weak as a cat . " You 've talked enough for one night . Let it rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of everything , and if she does n't want to , I 'll make her . You 've earned her gratitude . We 're all sorry this had to happen . " He shook my hand and started for the door . " Flying back tonight ? " I asked him . " I have to . My wife 's in bad shape . Take it easy , now , you 'll hear from me . And I 'll leave some money for you at the desk . " I SPRUNG myself out of the hospital three days later , and assembled myself aboard a plane for San Francisco . From International Airport I took a cab to the Sussex Arms Hotel . The room clerk , Farnsworth , was sitting behind the counter at the rear of the dim little lobby , looking as if he had n't moved in two weeks . He was reading a muscle magazine , and he did n't look up until I was close enough top142see the yellows of his eyes . Even then he did n't recognize me right away : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You wish a room , sir ? " " No . I came to see you . " " Me ? " His eyebrows jumped , and then came down in a frown of concentration . " I owe you something . " The color left his face . " No . No , you do n't . That 's all right . " " The other ten and the bonus . That makes fifteen I owe you . Excuse the delay . I got held up . " " That 's too bad . " He craned his neck around and looked behind him . There was nothing there but the switchboard , staring like a wall of empty eyes . " Do n't let it bother you , Farnsworth . It was n't your fault . Was it ? " " No . " He swallowed several times . " It was n't my fault . " I stood and smiled at him with the visible parts of my face . " What happened ? " he said after a while . " It 's a long sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the creaking new wallet out of my hip pocket and laid a five and a ten on the counter between us . He sat and looked at the money . " Take it , " I said . He did n't move . " Go ahead , do n't be bashful . The money belongs to you . " " Well . Thanks . " Slowly and reluctantly , he reached out for the bills . I caught his wrist in my left hand , and held it . He jerked convulsively , reached under the counter and came up with a gun in his left hand : " Turn me loose . " " Not a chance . "  | " I 'll shoot ! " But the gun was wavering . I reached for his gun wrist , and twisted it until the gun dropped on the counter between us . It was a .32 revolver , a little nickel-plated suicide gun . I let go of Farnsworth and picked it up and pointed it at the knot of his tie . Withoutmoving , he seemed to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please . I could n't help it . " " What could n't you help ? " " I had orders to give you that contact in Reno . " " Who gave you the orders ? " " Roy Lemberg . It was n't my fault . " " Lemberg does n't give orders to anybody . He 's the kind that takes them . " " Sure , he passed the word , that 's what I meant . " " Who gave him the word ? " " Some gambler in Nevada , name of Schwartz . " Farnsworthwet his mauve lips with his tongue . " Listen , you do n't want to ruin me . I make a little book , lay off the heavy bets . If I do n't do like the money boys say , I 'm out of business . So have a heart , mister . " " If you level with me . Does Lemberg work for Schwartz ? " " His brother does . Not him . " " Where are the Lembergs now ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I said , him and his wife both . Put the gun down , mister . Jeeze . I got a nervous stomach . " " You 'll have a perforated ulcer if you do n't talk . Where did the Lembergs go ? " " Los Angeles , I think . " " Where in Los Angeles ? " " I du n no . " He spread his hands . They had a tremorrunning through them , like dry twigs in a wind . " Honest . " " You know , Farnsworth , " I said in my menacing newp144lockjaw voice , " I 'll give you five seconds to tell me . " He looked around at the switchboard again , as if it was an instrument of execution , and swallowed audibly . " All right , I 'll tell you . They 're at a motor court on Bayshore , down by Moffett Field . The Triton Motor Court . At least , that 's where they said they were going . Now will you put down the gun , mister ? " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Do you know a man named Peter Culligan ? " " Yeah . He roomed here for a while , over a year ago . " " What did he do for a living ? " " He was a horseplayer . " " That 's a living ? " " I guess he hacked a little , too . Put the gun down , eh ? I told you what you wanted to know . " " Where did Culligan go from here ? " " I heard he got a job in Reno . " " Working for Schwartz ? " " Could be . He told me once he used to be a stickman . " I dropped the gun in my jacket pocket . " Hey , " he said . " That 's my gun . I bought it myself . " " You 're better off without it . " Looking back from the door , I saw that Farnsworth was halfway between the counter and the switchboard . He stopped in mid-motion . I went hack across the lobby : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip off the Lembergs , I 'll come back for you . Is that clear ? " A kind of moral wriggle moved up his body from his waist to his fish-belly face . " Yeah . Sure . Okay . " This time I did n't look back . I walked up to Union Square , where I made a reservation on an afternoon flight to L.A. Then I rented a car and drove down Bayshore past the airport . The hangars of Moffett Field loomed up through thep145smog like gray leviathans . The Triton Motor Court stood in a wasteland of shacks on the edge of the flight pattern . Its buildings were a fading salmon pink . Its only visible attraction was the $3.00 Double sign . Jets snored like flies in the sky . I parked on the cinder driveway beside the chicken-coop office . The woman who ran it wore a string of fake pearls dirtied by her neck . She said that Mr. and Mrs. Lemberg were n't registered there . " They may be going under their maiden name . " I describedthem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She do n't want to be disturbed , not in the daytime . " " She wo n't mind . I have no designs on her . " She bridled . " Who said you had ? What kind of a place do you think this is , anyway ? " It was a tough question to answer . I said : " What name is she going under ? " " You from the cops ? I do n't want trouble with the cops . " " I was in an accident . She may be able to help me find the driver . " " That 's different . " The woman probably did n't believe me , but she chose to act as if she did . " They registered under the name Hamburg , Mr. and Mrs. Rex Hamburg . " " Is her husband with her ? " " Not for the last week . Maybe it 's just as well , " she added cryptically . I knocked on the weathered door under the rusted iron seven . Footsteps dragged across the floor behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were puffed . The roots of her hair were darker . Her robe was taking on a grimy patina . She stopped blinking when she recognized me . " Go away . "  | " I 'm coming in for a minute . You do n't want trouble . " She looked past me , and I followed her look . The woman with the dirty pearls was watching us from the window of the office . " All right , come in . " She let me come in past her , and slammed the door on daylight . The room smelled of wine and smoke , stale orange-peel and a woman 's sleep , and a perfume I did n't recognize , Original Sin perhaps . When my eyes became night-adapted , I saw the confusion on the floor and the furniture : clothes and looped stockings and shoes and empty bottles , ashes and papers , the congealed remains of hamburgers and french fries . She sat in a defensive posture on the edge of the unmade bed . I cleared a space for myself on the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had a run-in with some of Tommy 's playmates . Your husband set me up for the fall . " " Roy did ? " " Do n't kid me , you were with him at the time . I thought he was a straight joe trying to help his brother , but he 's just another errandboy for mobsters . " " No . He is n't . " " Is that what he told you ? " " I lived with him nearly ten years , I ought to know . He worked one time for a crooked car-dealer in Nevada . When Roy found out about the crookedness , he quit . That 's the kind of guy he is . " " If you mean Generous Joe , that hardly qualifies Roy as a boy scout . " " I did n't say he was . He 's just a guy trying to get through life . " " Some of us make it harder for the others . " " You ca n't blame Roy for trying to protect himself . He'sp147wanted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't blame him for what Tommy did . " " You 're a loyal wife , " I said . " But where is it getting you ? " " Who says I want to get any place ? " " There are better places than this . " " You 're telling me . I 've lived in some of them . " " How long has Roy been gone ? " " Nearly two weeks , I guess . I do n't keep track of the time . It goes faster that way . " " How old are you , Fran ? " " None of your business . " After a pause she added : " A hundred and twenty-eight . " " Is Roy coming back ? " " He says he is . But he always sides with his brother when the chips are down . " Emotion flooded up in her eyes , but drained away again . " I guess I ca n't blame him . This time the chips are really down . " " Tommy 's staying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedge that would open her up . " Tommy 's in Nevada ? " " I saw him there . Schwartz is looking after him . And Roy , too , probably . " " I do n't believe you . Roy said they were leaving the country . " " The state , maybe . Is n't that what he said , that they were leaving the state ? " " The country , " she repeated stubbornly . " That 's why they could n't take me along . " " They were stringing you . They just do n't want a woman in the way . So here you sit in a rundown crib on Bayshore . Hustling for hamburgers , while the boys are living high on the hog in Nevada . " " You 're a liar ! " she cried . " They 're in Canada ! " " Do n't let them kid you . "  | " Roy is going to send for me as soon as he can swing it . " " You 've heard from him , then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her loose mouth tightened , too late to hold back the words . " Okay , so you got it out of me . That 's all you 're going to get out of me . " She folded her arms across her half-naked breasts , and looked at me grimly : " Why do n't you beat it ? You got nothing on me , you never will have . " " As soon as you show me Roy 's letter . " " There was no letter . I got the message by word of mouth . " " Who brought it ? " A guy . " " What guy ? " " Just a guy . Roy told him to look me up . " " He sent him from Nevada , probably . " " He did not . The guy drove a haulaway out from Detroit . He talked to Roy in Detroit . " " Is that where Roy and Tommy crossed the border ? " " I guess so . " " Where were they headed ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " I sat on the bed beside her . " Listen to me , Fran . You want your husband back , do n't you ? " " Not in a convict suit , or on a slab . " " It does n't have to be that way . Tommy 's the one we 're after . If Roy will turn him over to us , he 'll be taking a long step out of trouble . Can you get that message to Roy from me ? " " Maybe if he phones me or something . All I can do is wait . " " You must have some idea where they went . " " Yeah , they said something about this town in Ontario near Windsor . Tommy was the one that knew about it . "  | " What 's the name of the place ? " " They did n't say . " " Was Tommy ever in Canada before ? " " No , but Pete Culligan  --  " She covered the lower part of her face with her hand and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , but not for long . Her feelings were too diffuse to sustain themselves . I said : " Tommy did know Culligan , then ? " She nodded . " Did he have a personal reason for killing Culligan ? " " Not that I know of . Him and Pete were palsy-walsy . " " When did you see them together ? " " Last winter in Frisco . Tommy was gon na jump parole until Roy talked him out of it , and Pete told him about this place in Canada . It 's sort of an irony of fate like , now Tommy 's hiding out there for knocking Pete off . " " Did Tommy admit to you that he killed Culligan ? " " No , to hear him tell it he 's innocent as an unborn babe . Roy even believes him . " " But you do n't ? " " I swore off believing Tommy the day after I met him . But we wo n't go into that . " " Where is this hideout in Canada ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an edge of hysteria . " Why do n't you go away and leave me alone ? " " Will you contact me if you hear from them ? " " Maybe I will , maybe I wo n't . " " How are you fixed for money ? " " I 'm loaded , " she said . " What do you think ? I park in this crib because I like the homey atmosphere . " I dropped a ten in her lap as I went out . Before my plane took off for Los Angeles , I had time to phone Sheriff Trask . I filled him in , with emphasis on Culligan 's probablep150connection with Schwartz . In the rational light of day , I did n't want Schwartz all to myself . IN THE morning , after a session with my dentist , I opened up my office on Sunset Boulevard . The mailbox was stuffed with envelopes , mostly bills and circulars . There were two envelopes mailed from Santa Teresa in the past few days . The first one I opened contained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon Sable typed on the letterhead of his firm . Sad as was the fact of Anthony Galton 's death , his client and he both felt that the over-all outcome was better than could have been hoped for . He hoped and trusted that I was back in harness , and none the worse for wear , and would I forward my medical bills as I received them . The other letter was a carefully hand-written note from John Galton : Dear Mr. ArcherJust a brief note to thank you for your labours on my behalf . My father 's death is a painful blow to all of us here . There is tragedy in the situation , which I have to learn to face up to . But there is also opportunity , for me . I hope to prove myself worthy of my patrimony . Mr. Sable told me how you " fell among thieves . " I hope that you are well again , and Grandmother joins me in this wish . For what it 's worth , I did persuade Grandmother top151send you an additional check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to visit us when you can make the trip up this way . I myself would like very much to talk to you . Respectfully yours , John Galton . It seemed to be pure gratitude undiluted by commercialism , until I reflected that he was taking credit for the check Sable had sent me . His letter stirred up the suspicions that had been latent in my mind since I 'd talked to Sable in the hospital . Whatever John was , he was a bright boy and a fast worker . I wondered what he wanted from me . After going through the rest of my mail , I called my answering-service . The girl at the switchboard expressed surprise that I was still in the land of the living , and told me that a Dr. Howell had been trying to reach me . I called the Santa Teresa number he 'd left . A girl 's voice answered : " Dr. Howell 's residence . " " This is Lew Archer . Miss Howell ? " The temporary crown I 'd just acquired that morning pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Mr. Archer . " " Your father has been trying to get in touch with me . " " Oh . He 's just leaving for the hospital . I 'll see if I can catch him . " After a pause , Howell 's precise voice came over the line : " I 'm glad to hear from you , Archer . You may recall that we met briefly at Mrs. Galton 's house . I 'd like to buy you a lunch . " " Lunch will be fine . What time and place do you have in mind ? " " The time is up to you  --  the sooner the better . The Santa Teresa Country Club would be the most convenient place for me. "  | " It 's a long way for me to come for lunch . " " I had a little more than lunch in mind . " He lowered his voice as though he suspected eavesdroppers . " I 'd like to engage your services , if you 're free . " " To do what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . Would today be possible for you ? " " Yes . I 'll be at the Country Club at one . " " You ca n't drive it in three hours , man . " " I 'll take the noon plane . " " Oh , fine . " I heard the click as he hung up , and then a second click . Someone had been listening on an extension . I found out who it was when I got off the plane at Santa Teresa . A young girl with doe eyes and honey-colored hair was waiting for me at the barrier . " Remember me ? I 'm Sheila Howell . I thought I 'd pick you up . " " That was a nice thought . " " Not really . I have an ulterior motive . " She smiled charmingly . I followed her through the sunlitterminal to her car . It was a convertible with the top down . Sheila turned to me as she slid behind the wheel : " I might as well be frank about it . I overheard what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about John before Dad does . Dad is a well-meaning person , but he 's been a widower for ten years , and he has certain blind spots . He does n't understand the modern world . " " But you do ? " She colored slightly , like a peach in the sun . " I understand it better than Dad does . I 've studied social science at college , and people just do n't go around any more telling other people who to be interested in . That sort of thing is asp153dead as the proverbial dodo . Deader . " She nodded her small head , once , with emphasis . " First-year social science ? " The color in her cheeks deepened . Her eyes were candid , the color of the sky . " How did you know ? Anyway , I 'm a sophomore now . " As if this made all the difference between adolescence and maturity . " I 'm a mind reader . You 're interested in John Calton . " Her pure gaze did n't waver . " I love John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you wanted to say to me ? " " No . " She was suddenly flustered . " I did n't mean to say it . But it 's true . " Her eyes darkened . " The things that Dad believes are n't true , though . He 's just a typical patriarch type , full of prejudices against the boy I happen to like . He believes the most awful things against John , or pretends to . " " What things , Sheila ? " " I would n't even repeat them , so there . Anyway , you 'll be hearing them from him . I know what Dad wants you to do , you see . He let the cat out of the bag last night . " " What does he want me to do ? " " Please , " she said , " do n't talk to me as if I were a child . I know that tone so well , and I 'm so tired of it . Dad uses it on me all the time . He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be nineteen on my next birthday . " " Wow , " I said softly . " All right , go ahead and patronize me . Maybe I 'm not mature . I 'm mature enough to know good people from bad people . " " We all make mistakes about people , no matter how ancient we are . " " But I could n't be mistaken about John . He 's the nicest boy I ever met in my life . "  |p154I  said : " I like him , too . " " I 'm so glad . " Her hand touched my arm , like a bird alighting and then taking off again : " John likes you , or I would n't be taking you into our confidence . " " You would n't be planning on getting married ? " " Not just yet , " she said , as if this was a very conservative approach . " John has a lot of things he wants to do first , and of course I could n't go against Father 's wishes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She answered vaguely : " He wants to make something of himself . He 's very ambitious . And of course the one big thing in his life is finding out who killed his father . It 's all he thinks about . " " Has he done anything about it ? " " Not yet , but I know he has plans . He does n't tell me all he has on his mind . I probably would n't understand , anyway . He 's much more intelligent than I am . " " I 'm glad you realize that . It 's a good thing to bear in mind . " " What do you mean ? " she said in a small voice . But she knew what I meant : " It is n't true , what Father says , that John is an impostor . It ca n't be true ! " " What makes you so sure ? " " I know it here . " Her hand touched her breast , ever so lightly . " He could n't be lying to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So does Aunt Maria . " " Does John ever talk about his past to you ? " She regarded me with deepening distrust . " Now you sound just like Father again . You must n't ask me questions about John . It would n't be fair to John . " " Give yourself some thought , too , " I said . " I know it does n't seem likely , but if he is an impostor , you could be letting yourself in for a lot of pain and trouble . " " I do n't even care if he is ! " she cried , and burst into tears . A young man in airline coveralls came out of thep155terminal and glared at me . I was making a pretty girl cry , and there ought to be a law . I assumed a very legal expression . He went back inside again . My plane took off with a roar . The roar diminished to a cicada humming in the northern sky . Sheila 's tears passed like a summer shower . She started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a chauffeur who happened to be a deaf-mute . John was a very fast worker . BEFORE she deposited me in the main lounge of the clubhouse , Sheila apologized for her emotional outburst , as she called it , and said something inarticulate about not telling Daddy . I said that no apology was necessary , and that I would n't . The windows of the lounge overlooked the golf course . The players were a shifting confetti of color on the greens and fairways . I watched them until Howell came in at five minutes after one . He shook my hand vigorously . " Good to see you , Archer . I hope you do n't mind eating right away . I have to meet a committee shortly after two . " He led me into a huge dining-room . Most of the tables were roped off and empty . We took one by a window which looked out across a walled swimming-pool enclosure where young people were romping and splashing . The waiter deferred to Howell as if he was a member of the stewardship committee. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the first question that occurred to me : " What kind of a committeeare you meeting ? " " Are n't all committees alike ? They spend hours making up their collective mind to do something which any one of their members could accomplish in half the time . I 'm thinking of setting up a committee to work for the abolition of committees . " His smile was a rapid flash . " As a matter of fact , it 's a Heart Association committee . We 're laying plans for a fund campaign , and I happen to be chairman . Will you have something to drink ? I 'm going to have a Gibson . " " That will do for me . " He ordered two Gibsons from the hovering waiter . " As a medical man , I feel it 's my duty to perpetuate the little saving vices . It 's probably safer to overdrink than it is to overeat . What will you have to eat ? " I consulted the menu . " If you like sea food , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gordon Sable told me about your little accident . How 's the jaw ? " " Mending , thanks . " " What precisely was the trouble about , if you do n't object to the question ? " " It 's a long story , which boils down to something like this : Anthony Galton was killed for his money by a criminal named Nelson who had just escaped from prison . Your original guess was very close to the truth . But there 's more to the case . I believe Tony Galton 's murder and Pete Culligan 's murder are related . " Howell leaned forward across the table , his short gray hair bristling . " How related ? " " That 's the problem I was trying to solve when I got my jaw broken . Let me ask you a question , Doctor . What 's your impression of John Galton ? " " I was going to ask you the same question . Since you gotp157to it first , I 'll take first turn in answering . The boy seems open and aboveboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like obvious charm . His grand  --  Mrs. Galton seems to be charmed with him . " " She does n't question his identity ? " " Not in the slightest , she has n't from the beginning . For Maria , the boy is practically the reincarnation of her son Tony . Her companion , Miss Hildreth , feels very much the same way . I have to admit myself that the resemblance is striking . But such things can be arranged , when a great deal of money is involved . I suppose there 's no man alive who does n't have a double somewhere in the world . " " You 're suggesting that he was searched out and hired ? " " Has n't the possibility occurred to you ? " " Yes , it has . I think it should be explored . " " I 'm glad to hear you say that . I 'll be frank with you . It occurred to me when the boy turned up here , that you might be a part of the conspiracy . But Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other inquiries made . " His gray eyes probed mine . " In addition to which , you have the marks of honesty on your face . " " It 's the hard way to prove you 're honest . " Howell smiled slightly , looking out over the pool . His daughter , Sheila , had appeared at the poolside in a bathing-suit . She was beautifully made , but the fact seemed to give her no pleasure . She sat by herself , with a pale closed look , undergoing the growing pains of womanhood . Howell'sglance rested on her briefly , and a curious woodennesspossessed his face . The waiter brought our drinks , and we ordered lunch . When the waiter was out of hearing , Howell said : " It 's the boy 's story that bothers me . I understand you were the first to hear it . What do you think about it ? " " Sable and I gave him quite a going-over . IIc took it well , and his story stood up . I made notes on it the same night. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this morning , and could n't find any self-contradictions . " " The story may have been carefully prepared . Remember that the stakes are very high . You may be interested to know that Maria is planning to change her will in his favor . " " Already ? " " Already . She may already have done . Gordon would n't agree to it , so she called in another attorney to draw up a will . Maria 's half out of her mind  --  she 's pent up her generous feelings for so long , that she 's intoxicated with them . " " Is she incompetent ? " " By no means , " he said hastily . " I do n't mean to overstate the case . And I concede her perfect right to do what she wants to do with her own money . On the other hand , we ca n't let her be defrauded by a  --  confidence man . " " How much money is involved ? " He raised his eyes over my head as if he could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't estimate . Something like the national debt of a medium-sized European country . I know Henry left her oil property that brings in a weekly income in the thousands . And she has hundreds of thousands in securities . " " Where does it all go if it does n't go to the boy ? " Howell smiled mirthlessly . " I 'm not supposed to know that . It happens that I do , but I 'm certainly not supposed to tell . " " You 've been frank with me , " I said . " I 'll be frank with you . I 'm wondering if you have an interest in the estate . " He scratched at his jaw , violently , but gave no other sign of discomposure . " I have , yes , in several senses . Mrs. Galton named me executor in her original will . I assure you personal considerations are not influencing my judgment . Ip159think I know my own motives well enough to say that . " It 's a lucky man who does , I thought . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what exactly is bothering you ? " " The young man 's story . As he tells it , it does n't really start till age sixteen . There 's no way to go beyond that to his origins , whatever they may be . I tried , and came up against a stone wall . " " I 'm afraid I do n't follow you . The way John tells it , he was in an orphanage until he ran away at the age of sixteen . The Crystal Springs Home , in Ohio . " " I 've been in touch with a man I know in Cleveland  --  chap I went to medical school with . The Crystal Springs Home burned to the ground three years ago . " " That does n't make John a liar . He says he left there five and a half years ago . " " It does n't make him a liar , no . But if he is , it leaves us with no way to prove that he is . The records of the Home were completely destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Superintendent should be traceable . What was his name  --  Merriweather ? " " Merriweather died in the fire of a heart attack . All of this suggests the possibility  --  I 'd say probability  --  that John provided himself with a story ex post facto . Or was providedwith one . He or his backers looked around for a foolproof background to equip him with  --  one that was uncheckable . Crystal Springs was it  --  a large institution which no longer existed , which had no surviving records Who knows if John Brown ever spent a day there ? " " You 've been doing a lot of thinking about this . " " I have , and I have n't told you all of it . There 's the question of his speech , for instance . He represents himself as an American , born and raised in the United States . "  | " You 're not suggesting he 's a foreigner ? " " I am , though . National differences in speech have always interested me , and it happens I 've spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Canadian pronounce the word about ' ? " " If I did , I never noticed . About ' ? " " You say aba-oot , more or less . A Canadian pronounces the word more like aboat : And that 's the way John Brown pronounces it . " " Are you certain ? " " Of course I 'm certain . " " About the theory , I mean ? " " It is n't a theory . It 's a fact . I 've taken it up with specialistsin the subject . " " In the last two weeks ? " " In the last two days , " he said . " I had n't meant to bring this up , but my daughter , Sheila is  --  ah  --  interested in the boy . If he 's a criminal , as I suspect  --  " Howell broke off , almost choking on the words . Both our glances wandered to the poolside . Sheila was still alone , sitting on the edge and paddling her feet in the water . She turned to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck and body were stiff with expectancy . The waiter brought our food , and we ate in silence for a few minutes . Our end of the dining-room was slowly filling up with people in sports clothes . Slice and sand-trap seemed to be the passwords . Dr. Howell glanced around independently from time to time , as if to let the golfers know that he resented their intrusion on his privacy . " What do you intend to do , Doctor ? " " I propose to employ you myself . I understand that Gordon has terminated your services . " " So far as I know . Have you taken it up with him ? "  | " Naturally I have . He 's just as keen as I am that there should be further investigation . Unfortunately Maria wo n't hear of it , and as her attorney he ca n't very well proceed on his own . I can . " " Have you discussed it with Mrs. Galton ? " " I 've tried to . " Howell grimaced . " She wo n't listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrating , to say the least , but I can understand why she has to believe in him . The fact of her son Anthony 's death came as a great shock to her . She had to hold on to something , and there was Anthony 's putative son , ready and willing . Perhaps it was planned that way . At any rate , she 's clinging to the boy as if her life depended on it . " " What will the consequences be if we prove he 's crooked ? " " Naturally we 'll put him in prison where he belongs . " " I mean the consequences to Mrs. Galton 's health . Youtold me yourself that any great shock might kill her . " " That 's true , I did . " " Are n't you concerned about that ? " His face slowly reddened , in blotches . " Of course I 'm concerned . But there are ethical priorities in life . We ca n't sit still for a criminal conspiracy , merely because the victim has diseases . The longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in the long run for Maria . " " You 're probably right . Anyway , her health is your responsibility . I 'm willing to undertake the investigation . When do I begin ? " " Now . " " I 'll probably have to go to Michigan , for a start . That will cost money . " " I understand that . How much ? " " Five hundred . " Howell did n't blink . He produced a checkbook and ap162fountain pen . While he was making out the check , he said : " It might be a good idea if you talked to the boy first . That is , if you can do it without arousing suspicion . " " I think I can do that . I got an invitation from him this morning . " An invitation ? " " A written invitation to visit the Calton house . " " He 's making very free with Mrs. Galton 's property . Do you happen to have the document with you ? " I handed him the letter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right , by God ! " " What do you mean ? " " The dirty little hypocrite is a Canadian . Look here . " He put the letter on the table between us , and speared at it with his forefinger . " He spells the word labor ' 1 , a , b , o , u , r . It 's the British spelling , still current in Canada . He is n't even American . He 's an impostor . " " It 's going to take more than this to prove it . " " I realize that . Get busy , man . " " If you do n't mind , I 'll finish my lunch first . " Howell did n't hear me . He was looking out of the window again , half out of his seat . A dark-headed youth in a tan sport shirt was talking to Sheila Howell at the poolside . He turned his head slightly . I recognized John Gallon . He patted the shoulder of her terrycloth robe familiarly . Sheila smiled up full into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was out of the room before I could stop him . From the front door of the clubhouse , I saw him striding across the lawn toward the entrance of the swimming-pool enclosure . John and Sheila came out hand-in-hand . They were so intent on each other that they did n't see Howell until he was on top of them . He thrust himself between them , shakingp163the boy by the arm . His voice was an ugly tearing rent in the quietness : " Get out of here , do you hear me ? You 're not a member of this club . " John pulled away and faced him , white and rigid . " Sheila invited me . " " I dis-invite you . " The back of Howell 's neck was carbunclered . Sheila touched his arm . " Please , Daddy , do n't make a scene . There 's nothing to be gained . " John was encouraged to say : " My grandmother wo n't like this , Doctor . " " She will when she knows the facts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sails . He was n't as loud as he had been . " Please , " Sheila repeated . " John 's done no harm to anyone . " Do n't you understand , Sheila , I 'm trying to protect you ? " " From what ? " " From corruption . " " That 's silly , Dad . To hear you talk , you 'd think John was a criminal . " The boy 's head tilted suddenly , as if the word had struck a nerve in his neck . " Do n't argue with him , Sheila . I ought n't to 've come here . " He turned on his heel and walked head down toward the parking-lot . Sheila went in the other direction . Molded in terrycloth , her body had a massiveness and mystery that had n't struck me before . Her father stood and watched her until she entered the enclosure . She seemed to be moving heavily and fatally out of his control . I went back to the dining-room and let Howell find me there . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious loss of blood . His daughter was in the pool now ,  |p164swimming  its length back and forth with slow and powerfulstrokes . Her feet churned a steady white wake behind her . She was still swimming when we left . Howell drove me to the courthouse . He scowled up at the barred windows of the county jail : " Put him behind bars , that 's all I ask . " SHERIFF TRASK was in his office . Its walls were hung with testimonials from civic organizationsand service clubs ; recruiting certificates from Army , Navy , and Air Force ; and a number of pictures of the Sheriff himself taken with the Governor and other notables . Trask 's actual face was less genial than the face in the photographs . " Trouble ? " I said . " Sit down . You 're the trouble . You stir up a storm , and then you drop out of the picture . The trouble with you private investigators is irresponsibility . " " That 's a rough word , Sheriff . " I fingered the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I know you got yourself hurt , and I 'm sorry . But what can I do about it ? Otto Schwartz is outside my jurisdiction . " " Murder raps cross state lines , or have n't you heard . " " Yeah , and I also heard at the same time that you ca n't extradite without a case . Without some kind of evidence ,  |p165I  ca n't even get to Schwartz to question him . And you want to know why I have no evidence ? " " Let me guess . Me again . " " It is n't funny , Archer . I was depending on you for some discretion . Why did you have to go and spill your guts to Roy , Lemberg ? Scare my witnesses clear out of the damn country ? " " I got overeager , and made a mistake . I was n't the only one . " " What is that supposed to mean ? " " You told me Lemberg 's car had been stolen . " " That 's what switched license plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for a minute , pushing out his lower lip . " Okay . We made mistakes . I made a mediumsizeddilly and you made a peacheroo . So you took a beatingfor it . We wo n't sit around and cry . Where do we go from here ? " " It 's your case , Sheriff . I 'm just your patient helper . " He leaned toward me , heavy-shouldered and earnest . " You really mean to help ? Or have you got an angle ? " " I mean to help , that 's my angle . " " We 'll see . Are you still working for Sable  --  for Mrs. Galton , that is ? " " Not at the moment . " " Who 's bankrolling you . Dr. Howell ? " " News travels fast . " " Heck , I knew it before you did . Howell came around asking me to check your record with L.A. You seem to have some good friends down south . If you ever conned any old ladies , you never got caught . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed aside the badinage with an impatient gesture . " I assume you 're being hired to go into the boy 's background . Howell wanted me to . Naturally I told him IP166could n't move without some indication that law 's been broken . You got any such indication ? " " Not yet . " " Neither have I. I talked to the boy , and he 's as smooth as silk . He does n't even make any definite claims . He merely says that people tell him he 's his father 's son , so it 's probably so . " " Do you think he 's been coached , Sheriff ? " " I do n't know . He may be quarterbacking his own plays . When he came in to see me , it had nothing to do on the face of it with establishing his identity . He wanted information about his father 's murder , if this John Brown was his father . " " Has n't that been proved ? " " As close as it ever will be . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I started to say , he came in here to tell me what to do . He wanted more action on that old killing . I told him it was up to the San Mateo people , so what did he do ? He made a trip up there to build a fire under the San Mateo sheriff . " " It 's barely possible he 's serious . " " Either that , or he 's a psychologist . That kind of behavior does n't go with consciousness of guilt . " " The Syndicate hires good lawyers . " Trask pondered this , his eyes withdrawing under the ledges of his brows . " You think it 's a Syndicate job , eh ? A big conspiracy ? " " With a big payoff , in the millions . Howell tells me Mrs. Galton 's rewriting her will , leaving everything to the boy . I think her house should be watched . " " You honestly believe they 'd try to knock her off ? " " They kill people for peanuts . What would n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't let your imagination run away . It wo n't happen , not in Santa Teresa County . "  | " It started to happen two weeks ago , when Culligan got it . That has all the marks of a gang killing , and in your territory . " " Do n't rub it in . That case is n't finished yet . " " It 's the same case , " I said . " The Brown killing and the Culligan killing and the Galton impersonation , if it is one , all hang together . " " That 's easy to say . How do we prove it ? " " Through the boy . I 'm taking off for Michigan tonight . Howell thinks his accent originated in central Canada . That ties in with the Lembergs . Apparently they crossed the border into Canada from Detroit , and were headed for an address Culligan gave them . If you could trace Culligan that far back  --  " " We 're working on it . " Trask smiled , rather forbiddingly . " Your Reno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distance last night to a friend in Reno , captain of detectives . He called me back just before lunch . Culligan was working for Schwartz about a year ago . " " Doing what ? " " Steerer for his casino . Another interesting thing : Culliganwas arrested in Detroit five-six years ago . The FBI has a rap sheet on him . " " What was this particular rap ? " " An old larceny charge . It seems he left the country to evade it , got nabbed as soon as he showed his face on American soil , spent the next couple of years in Southern Michigan pen . " " What was the date of his arrest in Detroit ? " " I do n't remember exactly . It was about five-and-a-half years ago . I could look it up , if it matters . " " It matters . " " What 's on your mind ? " " John Galton turned up in Ann Arbor five-and-a-half years ago . Ann Arbor is practically a suburb of Detroit.  |p168I  'm asking myself if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , and flicked on the switch of his squawk-box : " Conger , bring me the Culligan records . Yeah , I 'm in my office . " I remembered Conger 's hard brown face . He did n't remember me at first , then did a double take : " Long time no see . " I quipped lamely : " How 's the handcuff business ? " " Clicking . " Trask rustled the papers Conger had brought , and frowned impatiently . When he looked up his eyes were crackling bright : " A little over five-and-a-half years . Culligan got picked up in Detroit January 7 . Does that fit with your date ? " " I have n't pinned it down yet , but I will . " I rose to go . Trask 's parting handshake was warm . " If you run into anything , call me collect , anytime day or night . And keep the hard nose out of the chopper . " " That 's my aspiration . " " By the way , your car 's in the county garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Save it for me . And take care of the old lady , eh ? " The Sheriff was giving Conger orders to that effect before I reached the door.  |p169I  CASHED Howell 's check at his bank just before it closed for business at three . The teller directed me to a travel agency where I made a plane reservation from Los Angeles to Detroit . The connecting plane did n't leave Santa Teresa for nearly three hours . I walked the few blocks to Sable 's office . The private elevator let me out into the oak-paneled anteroom . Mrs. Haines looked up from her work , and raised her hand to smooth her dyed red hair . She said in maternal dis-may : " Why , Mr. Archer , you were badly injured . Mr. Sable told me you 'd been hurt , but I had no idea  --  " " Stop it . You 're making me feel sorry for myself . " " What 's the matter with feeling sorry for yourself ? I do it all the time . It bucks me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She dipped her bright head as if I 'd paid her a compliment . " What 's the difference ? " " You do n't want me to spell it out . " She tittered , not unpleasantly , and tried to blush , but her experienced face resisted the attempt . " Some other time , perhaps . What can I do for you now ? " " Is Mr. Sable in ? " " I 'm sorry , he is n't back from lunch . " " It 's three-thirty . " " I know . I do n't expect he 'll be in again today . He 'll be sorry he missed you . The poor man 's schedule has been all broken up , ever since that trouble at his house . " " The murder , you mean ? "  | " That , and other things . His wife is n't well . " " So I understand . Gordon told me she had a breakdown . " " Oh , did he tell you that ? He does n't do much talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . " She made a confidential gesture , raising her red-tipped hand vertically beside her mouth . " Just between you and me , this is n't the first time he 's had trouble with her . " " When was the other time ? " " Times , in the plural . She came here one night in March when we were doing income tax , and accused me of trying to steal her husband . I could have told her a thing or two , but of course I could n't say a word in front of Mr. Sable . I tell you , he 's a living saint , what he 's taken from that woman , and he goes right on looking after her . " " What did she do to him ? " Color dabbed her cheekbones . She was slightly drunk with malice . " Plenty . Last summer she took off and went rampaging around the country spending his good money like water . Spending it on other men , too , can you imagine ? He finally tracked her down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Reno ? " " Reno , " she repeated flatly . " She probably intended to divorce him or something , but she gave up on the idea . She 'd have been doing him a favor , if you ask me . But the poor man talked her into coming back with him . He seems to be infatuated with her . " Her voice was disconsolate . After a moment 's thought , she said : " I ought n't to be telling you all this . Ought I ? " " I knew she had a history of trouble . Gordon told me himselfthat he had to put her in a nursing home . " " That 's right , he 's probably there with her now . He generally goes over to eat lunch with her , and most of the time he stays the rest of the day . Wasted devotion , I call it . If you ask me , that 's one marriage doomed to failure . I didp171a horoscope on it , and you never saw such antagonism in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is the nursing home she 's in , Mrs. Haines ? " " It 's Dr. Trenchard 's , on Light Street . But I would n't go there , if that 's what you 're thinking of . Mr. Sable does n't like to be disturbed when he 's visiting Mrs. Sable . " " I 'll take my chances . And I wo n't mention that I 've been here . Okay ? " " I guess so , " she said dubiously . " It 's over on the west side , 235 Light Street . " I took a cab across town . The driver looked me over curiously as I got out . Perhaps he was trying to figure out if I was patient or just a visitor . " You want me to wait ? " " I think so . If I do n't come out , you know what that will mean . " I left him having a delayed reaction . The " home " was a long stucco building set far back from the street on its own acre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence which surrounded the patio at the side . A man and a woman were sitting in a blue canvas swing behind the fence . Their backs were to me , but I recognized Sable 's white head . The woman 's blond head rested on his shoulder . I resisted the impulse to call out to them . I climbed the long veranda , which was out of sight of the patio , and pressed the bellpush beside the front door . The door was unlocked and opened by a nurse in white , without a cap . She was unexpectedly young and pretty . " Yes , sir ? " " I 'd like to speak to Mr. Sable . " " And who shall I say is calling ? " " Lew Archer . " She left me in a living-room or lounge whose furniturep172was covered with bright chintz . Two old ladies in shawls were watching a baseball game on television . A young man with a beard squatted on his heels in a corner , watching the opposite corner of the ceiling . His lips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun-filled patio . I saw the young nurse cross to the blue swing , and Sable 's face come up as if from sleep . He disengagedhimself from his wife . Her body relaxed into an awkward position . Blue-shadowed by the canvas shade of the swing , her face had the open-eyed blankness of a doll 's . Sable dragged his shadow across the imitation flagstone . He looked small , oddly diminished , under the sky 's blue height . The impression persisted when he entered the lounge . Age had fallen on him . He needed a haircut , and his tie was pulled to one side . The look he gave me was redeyed ; his voice was cranky . " What brings you here , anyway ? " " I wanted to see you . I do n't have much time in town . " " Well . You see me . " He lifted his arms from his sides , and dropped them . The old ladies , who had greeted him with smiles and nods , reacted like frightened children to his bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck and slunk out of the room . The other stretched her hand out toward Sable as if she wanted to comfort him . She remained frozen in that position while she went on watching the ball game . The bearded man watched the corner of the ceiling . " How is Mrs. Sable ? " " Not well . " He frowned , and drew me out into the corridor . " As a matter of fact , she 's threatened with melancholia . Dr. Trenchard tells me she 's had a similar illness before  --  before I married her . The shock she suffered two weeks ago stirred up the old trouble . Good Lord , was that only two weeks ago ? "  |p173I  risked asking : " What sort of background does she have ? " " Alice was a model in Chicago , and she 's been married before . She lost a child , and her first husband treated her badly . I 've tried to make it up to her . With damn poor success . " His voice sank toward despair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . Dr. Trenchard is one of the best psychiatrists on the coast . If she gets any worse , he 's going to try shock treatment . " He leaned on the wall , looking down at nothing in particular . His red eyes seemed to be burning . " You should go home and get some sleep . " " I have n't been sleeping much lately . It 's easy to say , sleep . But you ca n't will yourself to sleep . Besides , Alice needs me with her . She 's much calmer when I 'm around . " He shook himself , and straightened . " But you did n't come here to discuss my woes with me . " " That 's true , I did n't . I came to thank you for the check , and to ask you a couple of questions . " " You earned the money . I 'll answer the questions if I can . " " Dr. Howell has hired me to investigate John Galton 's background . Since you brought me into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course . You have it , as far as I 'm concerned . I ca n't speak for Mrs. Galton . " " I understand that . Howell tells me she 's sold on the boy . Howell himself is convinced that he 's a phoney . " " We 've discussed it . There seems to be some sort of romance between John and Howell 's daughter . " " Does Howell have any other special motive ? " " For doing what ? " " Investigating John , trying to prevent Mrs. Galton from changing her will . " Sable looked at me with some of his old sharpness . " That'sp174a good question . Under the present will , Howell stands to benefit in several ways . He himself is executor , and due to inherit a substantial sum , I really must n't say how much . His daughter , Sheila , is in for another substantial sum , very substantial . And after various other bequests have been met , the bulk of the estate goes to various charities , one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Howell is an officer of the Heart Association . All of which makes him a highly interested party . " " And highly interesting . Has the will been changed yet ? " " I ca n't say . I told Mrs. Galton I could n't conscientiously draw up a new will for her , under the circumstances . She said she 'd get someone else . Whether she has or not , I ca n't say . " " Then you 're not sold on the boy , either . " " I was . I no longer know what to think . Frankly , I have n't been giving the matter much thought . " He moved impatiently , and made a misstep to one side , his shoulder thudding against the wall . " If you do n't mind , I think I 'll get back to my wife . " The young nurse let me out . I looked back through the wire fence . Mrs. Sable remained in the same position on the swing . Her husband joined her in the blue shadow . He raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sat like a very old couple waiting for the afternoon shadows to lengthen and merge into night.  |p175THE  cab-driver stopped at the curb opposite the gates of the Galton estate . He hung one arm over the back of the seat and gave me a quizzical look : " No offense , Mister , but you want the front entrance or the service entrance ? " " The front entrance . " " Okay . I just did n't want to make a mistake . " He let me off under the porte-cochere . I paid him , and told him not to wait . The Negro maid let me into the reception hall , and left me to cool my heels among the ancestors . I moved over to one of the tall , narrow windows . It looked out across the front lawn , where the late afternoon sunlight lay serenely . I got some sense of the guarded peace that walled estates like this had once provided . In the modern world the walls were more like prison walls , or the wire fence around a nursing-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I preferred the service entrance . The people in the kitchen usually had more fun . Quick footsteps descended the stairs , and Cassie Hildrethcame into the room . She had on a skirt and a sweater which emphasized her figure . She looked more feminine in other , subtler , ways . Something had happened to change her style . She gave me her hand . " It 's good to see you , Mr. Archer . Sit down . Mrs. Galton will be down in a minute . " " Under her own power ? " " Yes , is n't it remarkable ? She 's becoming much morep176active than she was . John takes her out for a drive nearly every day . " " That 's nice of him . " " He actually seems to enjoy it . They hit it off from the start . " " He 's the one I really came to see . Is he around ? " " I have n't seen him since lunch . Probably he 's out in his car somewhere . " " His car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John 's crazy about it . He 's like a child with a new toy . He told me he 's never had a car of his own before . " " I guess he has a lot of things he never had before . " " Yes . I 'm so happy for him . " " You 're a generous woman . " " Not really . I 've a lot to be thankful for . Now that John 's come home , I would n't trade my life for any other . It may sound like a strange thing to say , but life is suddenly just as it was in the old days  --  before the war , before Tony died . Everything seems to have fallen into harmony . " She sounded as if she had transferred her lifelong crush from Tony to John Galton . A dream possessed her face . I wanted to warn her not to bank too heavily on it . Everythingcould fall into chaos again . Mrs. Galton was fussing on the stairs . Cassie went to the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailored suit with something white at her throat . Her hair was marcelled in hard gray corrugations which resembled galvanized iron . She extended her bony hand : " I 'm most pleased to see you . I 've been wanting to expressmy personal appreciation to you . You 've made my house a happier one . " " Your check was a very nice expression , " I said . " The laborer is worthy of his hire . " Perhaps she sensed that that was n't the most tactful way to put it , because shep177added : " Wo n't you stay for tea ? My grandson will want to see you . I expect him back for tea . He should be here now . " The querulous note was still in her voice . I wondered how much of her happiness was real , how much sheer will to believe that something good could happen to a poor old rich lady . She lowered herself into a chair , exaggerating the difficulty of her movements . Cassie began to look anxious . " I think he 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheila ? " " I think so , " Cassie said . " Is he still seeing a lot of her ? " " Just about every day . " " We 'll have to put a stop to that . He 's much too young to think of taking an interest in any one girl . Sheila is a dear sweet child , of course , but we ca n't have her monopolizing John . I have other plans for him . " " What plans , " I said , " if you do n't mind my asking ? " " I 'm thinking of sending John to Europe in the fall . He needs broadening , and he 's very much interested in the modern drama . If the interest persists , and deepens , I 'll build him a repertory theater here in Santa Teresa . John has great talent , you know . The Galton distinction comes out in a different form in each generation . " As if to demonstrate this proposition , a red Thunderbird convertible careened up the long driveway . A door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sullen . He stood insidethe doorway and pushed his fists deep in his jacket pockets , his head thrust forward in a peering attitude . " Well ! " he said . " Here we all are . The three fates , Clotho , Lachesis , and Mr. Archer . " " That is n't funny , John , " Cassie said in a voice of warning . " I think it 's funny . Very , very funny . " He came toward us , weaving slightly , exaggerating the movements of his shoulders . I went to meet him : " Hello , John . "  | " Get away from me . I know why you 're here . " " Tell me . " " I 'll tell you all right . " He threw a wild fist in my direction , staggering off balance . I moved in close , turned him with his back to me , took hold of his jacket collar with both hands and pulled it halfwaydown his arms . He sputtered words at me which smelled like the exhalations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrating through him . " Straighten up and quiet down , " I said . " I 'll knock your block off . " " First you 'll have to load yourself up with something solider than whisky . " Mrs. Galton breathed at my shoulder . " Has he been drink-ing ? " John answered her himself , in a kind of small-boy defiance : " Yes I have been drinking . And I 've been thinking . Thinking and drinking . I say it 's a lousy setup . " " What ? " she said . " What 's happened ? " " A lot of things have happened . Tell this man to turn me loose . " " Let him go , " Mrs. Galton said commandingly . " Do you think he 's ready ? " " Damn you , let me go . " He made a violent lunge , and tore loose from the arms of his jacket . He whirled and faced me with his fists up : " Come on and fight . I 'm not afraid of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tossed his jacket to him . He caught and held it , looking down at it stupidly . Cassie stepped between us . She took the jacket and helped him on with it . He submitted almost meekly to her hands . " You need some black coffee , John . Let me get you some black coffee . " " I do n't want coffee , I 'm not drunk . "  | " But you 've been drinking . " Mrs. Galton 's voice rose almostan octave and stayed there on a querulous monotone : " Your father started drinking young , you must n't let it happen all over again . Please , you must promise me . " The old lady hung on John 's arm , making anxious noises , while Cassie tried to soothe her . John 's head swung around , his eyes on me : " Get that man out of here ! He 's spying for Dr. Howell . " Mrs. Galton turned on me , the bony structure of her face pushing out through the seamed flesh : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Howell is incapable of committing disloyal acts behind my back . " " Do n't be too sure of that , " John said . " He does n't want me seeing Sheila . There 's nothing he would n't do to break it up . " " I 'm asking you , Mr. Archer . Did Dr. Howell hire you ? " " I 'll have to ask you to take it up with Howell . " " It is true , then ? " " I ca n't answer that , Mrs. Galton . " " In that case please leave my house . You entered it under false pretenses . If you trespass again , I 'll have you prosecuted . I 've a good mind to go to the authorities as it is . " " No , do n't do that , " John said . " We can handle it , Grandma . " He seemed to be sobering rapidly . Cassie chimed in : " You must n't get so excited about nothing . You know what Dr. Howell  --  " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed by an old and trusted friend  --  well , that 's what it is to have money . They think they have a right to it simply because it 's there . I see now what August Howell has been up to , insinuatinghimself and his chit of a daughter into my life . Well , he 's not getting a cent of my money . I 've seen to that . "  | " Please calm down , Aunt Maria . " Cassie tried to lead her back to her chair . Mrs. Calton would n't budge . She called hoarsely in my direction : " You can go and tell August Howell he 's overreached himself . He wo n't get a cent of my money , not a cent . It 's going to my own kith and kin . And tell him to keep that daughter of his from flinging herself at my grandson . I have other plans for him . " The breath rustled and moaned in her head . She closed her eyes ; her face was like a death mask . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . " Get out , " he said to me . " My grandmother is a sick woman . Ca n't you see what you 're doing to her ? " " Somebody 's doing it to her . " " Are you going to get out , or do I call the police ? " " You 'd better go , " Cassie said . " Mrs. Calton has a heart condition . " Mrs. Galton 's hand went to her heart automatically . Her head fell loosely onto John 's shoulder . He stroked her gray hair . It was a very touching scene . I wondered as I went out how many more scenes like that the old lady 's heart would stand . The question kept me awake on the night plane to Chicago . I PUT in two days of legwork in Ann Arbor , where I represented myself as a personnel investigatorfor a firm with overseas contracts . John 's account of his high school and college life checked out in detail . I estab/lished one interesting additional detail : He had enrolled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , on January 9 . Peter Culligan had been arrested in Detroit , forty miles away , on January 7 of the same year . Apparently it had taken the boy just two days to find a new protector in Gabriel Lindsay . I talked to friends of Lindsay 's , mostly high-school teachers . They remembered John as a likely boy , though he had been , as one of them said : " A tough little egg to start with . " They understood that Lindsay had taken him off the streets . Gabriel Lindsay had gone in for helping young people in trouble . He was an older man who had lost a son in the war , and his wife soon after the war . He died himself in the University Hospital in February of the previous year , of pneumonia . His doctor remembered John 's constant attendance at his bedside . The copy of his will on file in the Washtenaw County courthouse left two thousand dollars to " my quasifoster-son , known as John Lindsay , for the furtherance of his education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ; which probably meant it was all the money he had . John had graduated from the University in June , as a Speech major , with honors . His counselor in the Dean 's office said that he had been a student without any overt problems ; not exactly popular perhaps : he seemed to have no close friends . On the other hand , he had been active in campus theatrical productions , and moderately successful as an actor in his senior year . His address at the time of his graduation had been a rooming-house on Catherine Street , over behind the GraduateSchool . The landlady 's name was Mrs. Haskell . Maybe she could help me . Mrs. Haskell lived on the first floor of an old three-story gingerbread mansion . I guessed from the bundles of mailp182on the table inside the door that the rest of her house was given over to roomers . She led me along the polished parquetryhallway into a half-blinded parlor . It was a cool oasis in the heat of the Michigan July . Somewhere over our heads , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern drawl twanged like a mandolinin Mrs. Haskell 's voice : " Do sit down and tell me how John is . And how is he doing in his position ? " Mrs. Haskell clasped her hands enthusiasticallyon her flowered print bosom . The curled bangs on her forehead shook like silent bells . " He has n't started with us yet , Mrs. Haskell . The purpose of my investigation is to clear him for a confidential assign-ment . " " Does that mean the other thing has fallen through ? " " What other thing is that ? " " The acting thing . You may not know it , but John Lindsay'sa very fine actor . One of the most talented boys I 've ever had in my house . I never missed an appearance of his at the Lydia Mendelssohn . In Hobson 's Choice last winter , he was rich . " " " I bet he was . And you say he had acting offers ? " " I do n't know about offers in the plural , but he had one very good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract and train him professionally . The last I heard , John had accepted it . But I guess he changed his mind , if he 's going with your firm . Security . " " It 's interesting about his acting , " I said . " We like our employees to be well-rounded people . Do you remember the producer 's name ? " " I 'm afraid I never knew it . " " Where did he come from ? " " I do n't know . John was very secretive about his private affairs . He did n't even leave a forwarding address when hep183left in June . All I really know about this is what Miss Reichler told me after he left . " " Miss Reichler ? " " His friend . I do n't mean she was his girlfriend exactly . Maybe she thought so , but he did n't . I warned him not to get mixed up with a rich young lady like her , riding around in her Cadillacs and her convertibles . My boys come and go , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is several years older than John . " IIer lips moved over his name with a kind of maternal greed . The mandolin twang was becoming more pronounced . " He sounds like the kind of young man we need . Socially mobile , attractive to the ladies . " " Oh , he was always that . I do n't mean he 's girl-crazy . Ile paid the girls no mind , unless they forced themselves on his attention . Ada Reichler practically beat a path to his door . She used to drive up in her Cadillac every second or third day . Her father 's a big man in Detroit . Auto parts . " " Good , " I said . " A high-level business connection . " Mrs. Haskell sniffed . " Do n't count too much on that one . Miss Reichler was sore as a boil when John left without even saying good-by . She was really let down . I tried to explain to her that a young man just starting out in the world could n't carry any excess baggage . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slam-banged into her ear and ground those old Cadillac gears to a pulp . " " How long did they know each other ? " " As long as he was with me , at least a year . I guess she had her nice qualities , or he would n't have stuck with her so long . She 's pretty enough , if you like that slinky type . " " Do you have her address ? I 'd like to talk to her . " " She might tell you a lot of lies . You know : Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned . ' " " I can discount anything like that . "  | " See that you do . John 's a fine young man , and your peoplewill be lucky if he decides to go with them . Her father 's name is Ben , I think , Ben Reichler . They live over in the section by the river . " I drove on winding roads through a semi-wooded area . Eventually I found the Reichlers ' mailbox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick house with a sweeping roof . It looked small from a distance , and massive when I got up close to it . I began to understand how John could have made the leap from Mrs. Gorgello 's boardinghouseto the Calton house . He 'd been training for it . A man in overalls with a spraygun in his hands climbed up the granite steps of a sunken garden . " The folks are n't home , " he said . " They 're never home in July . " " Where can I find them ? " " If it 's business , Mr. Reichler 's in his office in the Reichler Building three-four days a week . " " Miss Ada Reichler 's the one I want . " " Far as I know , she 's in Kingsville with her mother . Kingsville , Canada . They have a place up there . You a friend of Miss Ada 's ? " " Friend of a friend , " I said . It was early evening when I drove into Kingsville . The heat had n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lake lay below the town like a blue haze in which white sails hung upright by their tips . The Reichlers ' summer place was on the lakeshore . Green terraces descended from the house to a private dock and boathouse . The house itself was a big old lodge whose brown shingled sides were shaggy with ivy . The Reichlers were n't camping out , though . The maid who answered the door wore a fresh starched uniform , complete with cap . She told me that Mrs. Reichler was resting and Miss Ada wasp185out in one of the boats . She was expected back at any time , if I cared to wait . I waited on the dock , which was plastered with No Trespassingsigns . A faint breeze had begun to stir , and the sailboatswere leaning shoreward . Mild little land-locked waves lapped at the pilings . A motorboat went by like a bird shakingout wings of white water . Its wash rocked the dock . The boat turned and came in , slowing down . A girl with dark hair and dark glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brown chest , and cocked her head questioningly . " You want me ? " I nodded , and she brought the boat in . I caught the line she threw and helped her onto the dock . Her body was lean and supple in black Capris and a halter . Her face , when she took off her glasses , was lean and intense . " Who are you ? " I had already decided to discard my role . " My name is Archer . I 'm a private detective from California . " " You came all this way to see me ? " " Yes . " " Why on earth ? " " Because you knew John Lindsay . " Her face opened up , ready for anything , wonderful or otherwise . " John sent you here ? " " Not exactly . " " Is he in some kind of trouble ? " I did n't answer her . She jerked at my arm like a child wanting attention . " Tell me , is John in trouble ? Do n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know whether he is or not , Miss Rcichlcr . What makes you jump to the conclusion that he is ? " " Nothing , I do n't mean that . " Her speech was staccato.  | " You said that you 're a detective . Does n't that indicate trouble ? " " Say he is in trouble . What then ? " " I 'd want to help him , naturally . Why are we talking in riddles ? " I liked her rapid , definite personality , and guessed that honesty went along with it : " I do n't like riddles any more than you do . I 'll make a bargain with you , Miss Reichler . I 'll tell you my end of the story if you 'll tell me yours . " " What is this , true confession hour ? " " I 'm serious , and I 'm willing to do my talking first . If you 're interested in John 's situation  --  " " Situation is a nice neutral word . " " That 's why I used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She gave me her hand on it , as a man would have . " I warn you in advance , though , I wo n't tell you anythingagainst him . I do n't know anything against him , except that he treated me  --  well , I was asking for it . " She lifted her high thin shoulders , shrugging off the past . " We can talk in the garden , if you like . " We climbed the terraces to a walled garden in the shadow of the house . It was crowded with the colors and odors of flowers . She placed me in a canvas chair facing hers . I told her where John was and what he was doing . Her eyes were soft and black , lit tremulously from within . Their expression followed all the movements of my story . She said when I 'd finished : " It sounds like one of Grimm 's fairy tales . The goatherd turns out to be the prince in disguise . Or like cEdipus . John had an CEdipus theory of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kingdom . I thought it was very clever . " Her voice was brittle . She was marking time . " John 's a clever boy , " I said . " And you 're a clever girl , andp187you knew him well . Do you believe he 's who he claims to be ? " " Do you ? " When I failed to answer , she said : " So he has a girl in California , already . " Her hands lay open on her slender thighs . She hugged them between her thighs . " The girl 's father hired me . He thinks John is a fraud . " " And you do , too ? " " I do n't like to think it , but I 'm afraid I do . There are some indications that his whole story was invented to fit the occasion . " " To inherit money ? " " That 's the general idea . I 've been talking to his landlady in Ann Arbor , Mrs. Haskell . " " I know her , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this offer John had from a producer ? " " Yes , he mentioned it to me . It was one of these personal contracts that movie producers give to promising young actors . This man saw him in Hobson 's Choice . " " When ? " " Last February . " " Did you meet the man ? " " I never did . John said he flew back to the coast . He did n't want to discuss it after that . " " Did he mention any names before he dried up ? " " Not that I recall . Do you think John was lying about him , that it was n't an acting job he was offered ? " " That could be . Or it could be John was sucked in . The conspirators made their approach as movie producers or agents , and later told him what was required of him . " " Why would John fall in with their plans ? He 's not a criminal . " " The Calton estate is worth millions . He stands to inherit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it would make him a rich man . "  | " But he never cared about money , at least not the kind you inherit . He could have married me : Barkis was willing . My father 's money was one of the reasons he did n't . At least that 's what he said . The real reason , I guess , was that he did n't love me . Does he love her ? " " My client 's daughter ? I could n't say for sure . Maybe he does n't love anybody . " " You 're very honest , Mr. Archer . I gave you an opening , but you did n't try to use her on me as a wedge . You could have said that he was crazy about her , thus fanning the fires of jealousy . " She winced at her own self-mockery . " I try to be honest with honest people . " She gave me a flashing look . " That 's intended to put me on the spot . " " Yes . " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see all the way to California . The last sails were convergingtoward shore , away from the darkness falling like soot along the horizon . As light drained from the sky , it seemed to gather more intensely on the water . " What will they do to him if they find out he 's an im-postor ? " " Put him in jail . " " For how long ? " " It 's hard to say . It 'll be easier on him if we get it over with soon . He has n't made any big claims yet , or taken any big money . " " You really mean , really and truly , that I 'd be doing him a favor by puncturing his story ? " " That 's my honest opinion . If it 's all a pack of lies , we 'll find out sooner or later . The sooner the better . " She hesitated . Her profile was stark . One cord in her neck stood out under the skin . " You say that he claims that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Crystal Springs , Ohio . Did he ever mention the place to you ? " She shook her head in a quick short arc . I said : " There are some indications that he was raised here in Canada . " " What indications ? " " Speech . Spelling . " She rose suddenly , walked to the end of the garden , stooped to pick a snapdragon , threw it away with a spurninggesture . She came back toward me and stood with her face half-averted . She said in a rough dry voice : " Just do n't tell him I was the one that told you . I could n't bear to have him hate me , even if I never see him again . The poor damn silly fool was born and raised right here in Ontario . His real name is Theodore Fredericks , and his mother runs a boardinghouse in Pitt , not more than sixty miles from here . " I stood up , forcing her to look at me . " How do you know , Miss Reichler ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a very fortunate meeting . It did n't do anything for either of us . I should never have gone there . " " Did he take you to meet his mother ? " " Hardly . I went to see her myself a couple of weeks ago , after John left Ann Arbor . When I did n't hear from him I got it into my head that perhaps he 'd gone home to Pitt . " " How did you learn about his home in Pitt ? Did he tell you ? " " Yes , but I do n't believe he intended to . It happened on the spur of the moment , when he was spending a week-end here with us . It was the only time he ever came to visit us here in Kingsville , and it was a bad time for me  --  the worst . I hate to think of it . " " Why ? "  | " If you have to know , he turned me down . We went for a drive on Sunday morning . I did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel of my car . That 's the way he was with me , so proud , and I had no pride at all with him . I got carried away by the flowers and the bees , or something , and I asked him to marry me . He gave me a flat refusal . " He must have seen how hurt I was , because he asked me to drive him to Pitt . We were n't too far from there , and he wanted to show me something . When we got there he made me drive down a street that runs along by the river on the edge of the Negro section . It was a dreadful neighborhood , filthy children of all colors playing in the mud , and slatternly women screaming at them . We stopped across from an old red brick house where some men in their undershirts were sitting on the front steps passing around a wine jug .

She had a voice like a kazoo , and she was a hideous fat pig of a woman . John said that she was his mother . " I did n't believe him . I thought he was hoaxing me , puttingme to some kind of silly test . It was a test , in a way , but not in the way I imagined . Ile wanted to be known , I think . He wanted me to accept him as he actually was . But by the time I understood that , it was too late . He 'd gone into one of his deep freezes . " She touched her mournful mouth with the tips of her long fingers . " When did this happen ? " " Last spring . It must have been early in March , there was still some snow on the ground . " " Did you see John after that ? " " A few times , but it was n't any good . I think he regretted telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That Sun-P191day in Pitt was the end of any real communication between us . There were so many things we could n't talk about , finally we could n't talk at all . The last time I saw him was humiliating , for him , and for me , too . He asked me not to mention what he 'd said about his origins , if anyone ever brought it up " " Who did he expect to bring it up ? The police ? " " The immigration authorities . Apparently there was somethingirregular about his entry into the United States . That fitted in with what his mother told me afterwards . He 'd run away with one of her boarders when he was sixteen , and apparently crossed over into the States . " " Did she give you the boarder 's name ? " " No . I 'm surprised Mrs. Fredericks told me as much as she did . You know how the lower classes are , suspicious . But I gave her a little money , and that loosened her up . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I know , I 'm just what John said I was , a dollar snob . Well , I had my comeuppance .

" " He was easy to lose , " I said , " and no great loss . " She looked at me like an enemy . " You do n't know him . John 's a fine person at heart , fine and deep . I was the one who failed in our relationship . If I 'd been able to understand him that Sunday , say the right thing and hold him , he might n't have gone into this fraudulent life . I 'm the one who was n't good for anything . " She screwed up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making herself look ugly . " I 'm just a hag . " " Be quiet . "  |p192She  looked at me incredulously , one hand flat against her temple . " Who do you think you 're talking to ? " " Ada Reichler . You 're worth five of him . " " I 'm not . I 'm no good . I betrayed him . Nobody could love me . Nobody could . " " I told you to be quiet . " I 'd never been angrier in my life . " Do n't you dare speak to me like that . Do n't you dare ! " Her eyes were as bright and heavy as mercury . She ran blind to the end of the garden , knelt at the edge of the grass , and buried her face in flowers . Her back was long and beautiful . I waited until she was still , and lifted her to her feet . She turned toward me . The last light faded from the flowers and from the lake . Night came on warm and moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ( C41C " ( C chapter 2 5 ( Cg ( C. ( CC ( CC ( CTHE town of Pitt was dark except for occasional street lights and the fainter lights that fell from the heavily starred sky . Driving along the street Ada Reichlerhad named , I could see the moving river down between the houses . When I got out of the car , I could smell the river . A chanting chorus of frogs made the summer night pulsate at its edges . On the second floor of the old red house , a bleary light outlined a window . The boards of the veranda groaned under my weight . I knocked on the alligatored door . A card offering " Rooms for Rent " was stuck inside the window besidethe door.  |p193A  light went on over my head . Moths swirled up around it like unseasonable snow . An old man peered out , cocking his narrow gray head at me out of a permanent stoop . " Something you want ? " His voice was a husky whisper . " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Mr. Fredericks . If it 's a room you want , I can rent you a room just as good as she can . " " Do you rent by the night ? " " Sure , I got a nice front room you can have . It 'll cost you  --  let 's see . " He stroked the bristles along the edge of his jaw , making a rasping noise . His dull eyes looked me over with stupid cunning . " Two dollars ? " " I 'd like to see the room first . " " If you say so . Try not to make too much noise , eh ? The old woman  --  Mrs. Fredericks is in bed . " He must have been just about to go himself . His shirt was open so that I could have counted his ribs , and his broad striped suspenders were hanging down . I followed him up the stairs . He moved with elaborate secrecy , and turned at the top to set a hushing finger to his lips . The light from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman 's voice rose from the back of the house : " What are you creeping around for ? " " Did n't want to disturb the boarders , " he said in his carrying whisper . " The boarders are n't in yet , and you know it . Is somebody with you ? " " Nope . Just me and my shadow . " He smiled a yellow-toothed smile at me , as if he expected me to share the joke . " Come to bed then , " she called . " In a minute . " He tiptoed to the front of the hallway , beckoned mep194through an open door , and closed the door quietly behind me . For a moment we were alone in the dark , like conspirators . I could hear his emotional breathing . Then he reached up to pull on a light . It swung on its cord , throwing lariats of shadow up to the high ceiling , and shifting gleam and gloom on the room 's contents . These included a bureau , a washstand with pitcher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many bodies . The furnishingsreminded me of the room John Brown had had in Luna Bay . John Brown ? John Nobody . I looked at the old man 's ever possessed good looks , time had washed them out . His face was patchily furred leather , stretched on gaunt bones , held in place by black nailhead eyes . " The room all right ? " he said uneasily . I glanced at the flowered paper on the walls . Faded morning-glories climbed brown lattices to the watermarked ceiling . I did n't think I could sleep in a room with morninggloriescrawling up the walls all night . " If it 's bugs you 're worried about , " he said , " we had the place fumigated last spring . " " Oh . Good . " " I 'll let in some fresh air . " He opened the window and sidled back to me . " Pay me cash in advance , and I can let you have it for a dollar and a half . " I had no intention of staying the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took out my wallet and gave him two ones . His hand trembled as he took them : " I got no change . " " Keep it . Mr. Fredericks , you have a son . " He gave me a long slow cautious look . " What if I have ? " " A boy named Theodore . " " He 's no boy . He 'll be grown up now . "  | " How long is it since you 've seen him ? " " I du n no . Four-five years , maybe longer . He ran away when he was sixteen . It 's a tough thing to have to say about your own boy , but it was good riddance of bad rubbish . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because it 's the truth . You acquainted with Theo ? " " Slightly . " " Is he in trouble again ? Is that why you 're here ? " Before I could answer , the door of the room flew open . A short stout woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fredericks : " What you think you 're doing , renting a room behind my back ? " " I did n't . " But the money was still in his hand . He tried to crumple it in his fist and hide it . She grabbed for it : " Give me my money . " He hugged his valuable fist against his washboard chest . " It 's just as much my money as it is yours . " " Aw no it is n't . I work myself to the bone keeping our heads above water . And what do you do ? Drink it up as fast as I can make it . " " I ai n't had a drink for a week . " " You 're a liar . " She stamped her bare foot . Her body shook under the nightgown , and her gray braids swung like cables down her back . " You were drinking wine last night with the boys in the downstairs bedroom . " " That was free , " he said virtuously . " And you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stranger . " She turned to me for the first time . " Excuse us , mister . It 's no fault of yours , but he ca n't handle money . " She added unnecessarily : " He drinks . " While her eyes were off him , Fredericks made for the door . She intercepted him . He struggled feebly in her embrace . Her upper arms were as thick as hams . She pried open his bony fist and pushed the crumpled bills down be/tween her breasts . He watched the money go as though it represented his hope of heaven : " Just give me fifty cents . Fifty cents wo n't break you . " " Not one red cent , " she said . " If you think I 'm going tohelp you get the d.t. ' s again , you got another think coming . " " All I want is one drink . " " Sure , and then another and another . Until you feel the rats crawling up under your clothes , and I got to nurse you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of rats . A woman that wo n't give her lawful husband four bits to settle his stomach is the worst kind of rat there is . " " Take that back . " She moved on him , arms akimbo . He backed into the hallway : " All right , I take it back . But I 'll get a drink , do n't worry . I got good friends in this town , they know my worth . " " Sure they do . They feed you stinking rotgut across the river , and then they come to me asking for money . Do n't you set foot outside this house tonight . " " You 're not going to order me around , treat me like a hasbeen . It ai n't my fault I ca n't work , with a hole in my belly . It ai n't my fault I ca n't sleep without a drink to ease the pain . " " Scat , " she said . " Go to bed , old man " He shambled away , trailing his slack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I apologize for my husband . He 's never been the same since his accident . " " What happened to him ? " " He got hurt bad . " Her answer seemed deliberately vague . Under folds of fat , her face showed traces of her son 's stubbornintelligence . She changed the subject : " I notice you paid with American money . You from the States ? "  | " I just drove over from Detroit . " " You live in Detroit ? I never been over there , but I hear it 's an interesting place . " " It probably is . I was just passing through on my way from California . " " What brings you all the way from California ? " " A man named Peter Culligan was murdered there several weeks ago . Culligan was stabbed to death . " " Stabbed to death ? " I nodded . Her head moved slightly in unison with mine . Without shifting her eyes from my face , she moved around me and sat on the edge of the bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He boarded with me for a while , years ago . He had this very room . " " What was he doing in Canada ? " " Do n't ask me . I do n't ask my boarders where their money comes from . Mostly he sat in this room and studied his racing sheets . " She looked up shrewdly from under frowningbrows . " Would you be a policeman ? " " I 'm working with the police . Are you sure you do n't know why Culligan came here ? " " I guess it was just a place like any other . He was a loner and a drifter  --  I get quite a few of them . He probably covereda lot of territory in his time . " She looked up at the shadows on the ceiling . The light was still now , and the shadows were concentric , spreading out like ripples on a pool . " Listen , mister , who stabbed him ? " " A young hoodlum . " " My boy ? Was it my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " I think your son is involved . " " I knew it . " Her cheeks shuddered . " He took a knife to his father before he was out of high school . IIc would of killedp198him , too . Now he really is a murderer . " She pressed her clenched hands deep into her bosom ; it swelled around her fists like rising dough . " I did n't have enough trouble in my life . I had to give birth to a murderer . " " I do n't know about that , Mrs. Fredericks . He committed fraud . I doubt that he committed murder . " Even as I said it , I was wondering if he had been within striking distance of Culligan , and if he had an alibi for that day . " Do you have a picture of your son ? " " I have when he was in high school . He ran away before he graduated . " " May I have a look at the picture , Mrs. Fredericks ? It 's barely possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any hope of this died a quick death . The boy in the snapshot she brought was the same one , six years younger . He stood on a riverbank , his back to the water , smiling with conscious charm into the camera . I gave the picture back to Mrs. Fredericks . She held it up to the light and studied it as if she could re-create the past from its single image . " Theo was a good-looking boy , " she said wistfully . " He was doing so good in school and all , until he started getting those ideas of his . " " What kind of ideas did he have ? " " Crazy ideas , like he was the son of an English lord , and the gypsies stole him away when he was a baby . When he was just a little tyke , he used to call himself Percival Fitzroy , like in a book . That was always his way  --  he thought he was too good for his own people . I worried about where all that daydreaming was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming , " I said . " Right now he 's representinghimself as the grandson of a wealthy woman in Southern California . Do you know anything about that ? " " I never hear from him . How would I know about it ? "  | " Apparently Culligan put him up to it . I understand he ran away from here with Culligan . " " Yeah . The dirty scamp talked him into it , turned him against his own father . " " And you say he knifed his father ? " " That very same day . " Her eyes widened and glazed . " He stabbed him with a butcher knife , gave him an awful wound . Fredericks was on his back for weeks . He 's never got back on his feet entirely . Neither have I , to think my own boy would do a thing like that . " " What was the trouble about , Mrs. Fredericks ? " " Wildness and willfulness , " she said . " He wanted to leave home and make his own way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Theo 's welfare at heart and I know what you 're thinking , that Theo did right to run away from home with his old man a bum and the kind of boarders I get . But the proof of the pudding is in the eating . Look at how Theo turned out . " " I have been , Mrs. Fredericks . " " I knew he was headed for a bad end , " she said . " He did n't show natural feelings . He never wrote home once since he left . Where has he been all these years ? " " Going to college . " " To college ? He went to college ? " " Your son 's an ambitious boy . " " Oh , he always had an ambition , if that 's what you want to call it . Is that what he learned in college , how to cheat people ? " " He learned that someplace else . " Perhaps in this room , I thought , where Culligan spun his fantasies and laid a long-shot bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Culligan 's taint on it . The woman stirred uncomfortably , as if I 'd made a subtle accusation :  | " I do n't claim we were good parents to him . He wanted more than we could give him . He always had a dream of himself , like . " Her face moved sluggishly , trying to find the shape of truth and feeling . She leaned back on her arms and let her gaze rest on the swollen slopes of her body , great sagging breasts , distended belly from which a son had struggled headfirst into the light . Over her bowed head , insects swung in eccentric orbits around the hanging bulb , tempting hot death . She managed to find some hope in the situation : " At least he did n't murder anybody , eh ? " " No . " " Who was it that knifed Culligan ? You said it was a young hoodlum . " " His name is Tommy Lemberg . Tommy and his brother Roy are supposed to be hiding out in Ontario  --  " " Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using that name . Do you know Roy and Tommy ? " " I hope to tell you . They been renting the downstairs room for the last two weeks . They told me their name was Hamburg . How was I to know they were hiding out ? " ( c.HtNic.Hc. : ( c ( c4- (  --  ( ia4 ( chapter 26C4 ( c , oux ( c ' ( c I WAITED for the Lembergs on thedark porch . They came home after midnight , walking a bit unsteadily down the street . My parked car attracted theirp201attention , and they crossed the street to look it over . I went down the front steps and across the street after them . They turned , so close together that they resembled a single amorphous body with two white startled faces . Tommy started toward me , a wide lopsided shape . His arm was still in a white sling under his jacket . Roy lifted his head with a kind of hopeless alertness . " Come back here , kid . " " The hell . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me busily , and spat in the dust at my feet . " Take it easy , Tommy . " Roy came up behind him . " Talk to him . " " Sure I 'll talk to him . " He said to me : " Did n't you get enough from Mr. Schwartz ? You came all this way looking for more ? " Without giving the matter any advance thought , I set myselfon my heels and hit him with all my force on the point of the jaw . He went down and stayed . His brother knelt beside him , making small shocked noises which resolved themselves into words : " You had no right to hit him . He wanted to talk to you . " " I heard him . " " He 's been drinking , and he was scared . He was just putting on a big bluff . " " Put away the violin . It does n't go with a knifing rap . " " Tommy never knifed anybody . " " That 's right , he was framed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy was just an innocentbystander . " " I do n't claim he was innocent . Schwartz sent him there to throw his weight around . But nobody figured he was going to run into Culligan , let alone Culligan with a knife and a gun . He got shot taking the gun away from Culligan . Then he knocked Culligan out , and that 's the whole thing as far as Tommy 's concerned . "  | " At which point the Apaches came out of the hills . " " I thought maybe you 'd be interested in the truth , " Roy said in a shaking voice . " But your thinking is the same as all the others . Once a fellow takes a fall , he 's got no human rights . " " Sure , I 'm unfair to organized crime . " The wisecrack sounded faintly tinny , even to me . Roy made a disgusted sound in his throat . Tommy groaned as if in response . His eyes were still turned up , veined white between half-closed lids . Roy inserted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peering down at the dim face , unconscious and innocentlooking , I had a pang of doubt . I knew my bitterness was n't all for Tommy Lemberg . When I hit him I was lashing out at the other boy , too , reacting to a world of treacherous little hustlers that would n't let a man believe in it . I scraped together a nickel 's worth of something , faith or gullibility , and invested it : " Lemberg , do you believe this yarn your brother told you ?  --  " Yes . " " Are you willing to put it to the test ? " " I do n't understand you . " But his white face slanted up fearfully . " If you 're talking about him going back to California , no . They 'd put him in the gas chamber . " " Not if his story is true . He could do a lot to back it up by coming back with me voluntarily . " " He ca n't . He 's been in jail . He has a record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , does n't it ? More than it does to other people , maybe . " " I do n't dig you . " " Why do n't you dissolve the brother act ? Commit yourselfwhere there 's some future . Your wife could do with a piece of you . She 's in a bad way , Lemberg. "  |p203He  did n't answer me . He held his brother 's head possessivelyagainst his shoulder . In the light of the stars they seemed like twins , mirror images of each other . Roy looked at Tommy in a puzzled way , as if he could n't tell which was the real man and which was the reflection . Or which was the possessor and which was the possessed . Footfalls thudded in the dust behind me . It was Mrs. Fredericks , wearing a bathrobe and carrying a pan of water . " Here , " was all she said . She handed me the pan and went back into the house . She wanted no part of the trouble in the street . Her house was well supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . He snorted and sat up blinking . " Who hit me ? " Then he saw me , and remembered : " You sucker-punched me . You sucker-punched a cripple . " He tried to get up . Roy held him down with both hands on his shoulders : " You had it coming , you know that . I 've been talking to Mr. Archer . He 'll listen to what you have to say . " " I 'm willing to listen to the truth , " I said . " Anything else is a waste of time . " With his brother 's help , Tommy got onto his feet . " Go ahead , " Roy prompted him . " Tell him . And no more kid stuff . " " The whole truth , remember , " I said , " including the Schwartz angle . " " Yeah . Yeah . " Tommy was still dazed . " Schwartz was the one hired me in the first place . He sent one of his boys to look me up , promised me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " " A little death , you mean ? " He shook his head violently . " Nothing like that , just a little working over . "  | " What did Schwartz have against Culligan ? " " Culligan was n't the one . He was n't supposed to be there , see . He got in the picture by mistake . " " I told you that , " Roy said . " Be quiet . Let Tommy do the talking . " " Yeah , sure , " Tommy said . " It was this beast that I was supposed to put on a little show for . I was n't supposed to hurt her , nothing like that , just put the fear of God in her so she 'd cough up what she owed Schwartz . It was like a collection agency , y'unnerstan ' ? Legit . " " What was her name ? " " Alice Sable . They sent me because I knew what she looked like . Last summer in Reno she used to run around with Pete Culligan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , for God sake . The way they told it to me , she was alone by herself out there all day . When Culligan came marching out , armed up to the teeth , you could of knocked me over with a ' dozer . " I moved in on him , very fast , very fast reflexes I got , talking all the time . Got hold of the gun but it went off , the slug plowed up my arm , same time he dropped the gun . I picked it up . By that time he had his knife out . What could I do ? He was going to gut me . I slammed him on the noggin with the gun and chilled him . Then I beat it . " " Did you see Alice Sable ? " " Yeah , she came surging out and yelled at me . I was startingthe Jag , and I could n't hear what she said over the engine . I did n't stop or turn around . Hell , I did n't want to rough up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Culligan 's knife before you left , and cut him with it ? " " No sir . What would I do that for ? Man , I was hurt . I wanted out . " " What was Culligan doing when you left ? " " Laying there . " He glanced at his brother . " Lying there . "  | " Who coached you to say that ? " " Nobody did . " " That 's true , " Roy said . " It 's just the way he told it to me . You 've got to believe him . " " I 'm not the important one . The man he has to convince is Sheriff Trask of Santa Teresa County . And planes are taking off for there all the time . " " Aw , no . " Tommy 's gaze swiveled frantically from me to Roy . " They 'll throw the book at me if I go back . " " Sooner or later you have to go back . You can come along peaceably now , or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg-chains . Which way do you want it , hard or easy ? " For once in his young life , Tommy Lemberg did some , thing the easy way . I PHONED Sheriff Trask long distance . He agreed to wire me transportation authorization for the Lemberg brothers . I picked it up at Willow Run , and the three of us got aboard an early plane . Trask had an official car waiting to meet the connecting plane when it landed in Santa Teresa . Before noon we were in the interrogation room in the Santa Teresa courthouse . Roy and Tommy made statements , which were recorded by a court reporter on steno and tape . machine . Tommy seemed to be awed by the big room with its barred windows , the Sheriff 's quiet power , the weight of the law which both man and building represented . Therep206were no discrepancies in the part of his statement I heard . Trask motioned me out before Tommy was finished . I followed him down the corridor to his office . He took off his coat and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his armpits . He filled a paper cup with water from a cooler , drained the cup , and crushed it in his fist . " If we buy this , " he said at last , " it puts us back at the beginning . You buy it , do n't you , Archer ? " " I 've taken an option on at . Naturally I think it should be investigated . But that can wait . Have you questioned Theo Fredericks about the Culligan killing ? " " No . " " Is Fredericks doing any talking at all ? " " Not to me he is n't . " " But you picked him up last night ? " Trask 's face had a raw red look . I thought at first that he was on the verge of a heart attack . Then I realized that he was painfully embarrassed . He turned his back on me , walked over to the wall , and stood looking at a photograph of himself shaking hands with the Governor . " Somebody tipped him off , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got there . " He turned to face me : " The worst part of it is , he took Sheila Howell with him . " " By force ? " " You kidding ? She was probably the one who tipped him off . I made the mistake of phoning Dr. Howell before I moved on the little rat . In any case , she went along with him willingly  --  walked out of her father 's house and drove away with him in the middle of the night . Howell 's been on my back ever since . " " Howell 's very fond of his daughter . " " Yeah , I know how he feels , I have a daughter of my own . I was afraid for a while that he was going to take off after her with a shotgun , and I mean literally . Howell 's a trapshooter , one of the best in the county . But I got him calmedp207down . He 's in the communications room , waiting to hear some word of them . " " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought for him . " " A red Thunderbird should be easy to spot . " " You 'd think so . But they 've been gone over eight hours without a trace . They may be in Mexico by now . Or they may be cuddled up in an L.A. motel under one of his aliases . " Trask scowled at the image . " Why do so many nice young girls go for the dangerous ones ? " The question did n't expect an answer , and that was just as well . I had n't any . Trask sat down heavily behind his desk . " Just how dangerousis he ? When we talked on the telephone last night , you mentioned a knifing he did before he left Canada . " " He stabbed his father . Apparently he meant to kill him . The old man is no saint , either . In fact , the Fredericks ' boardinghouse is a regular thieves ' kitchen . Peter Culligan was staying there at the time of the knifing . The boy ran away with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abstractedly , dropping the pieces on his blotter . " How do we know the Fredericks boy did n't murder Culligan ? He had a motive : Culligan was in a position to call his bluff and tell the world who he really was . And M.O . figures , with his knifing record . " " We 've been thinking the same thing , Sheriff . There 's even a strong likelihood that Culligan was his partner in the conspiracy . That would give him a powerful motive to silence Culligan . We 've been assuming that Fredericks was in Luna Bay that day . But has his alibi ever been checked ? " " There 's no time like the present . " Trask picked up his phone and asked the switchboard to put through a call to the San Mateo County sheriff 's office in Redwood City.  | " I can think of one other possibility , " I said . " Alice Sable was involved with Culligan last year in Reno , and maybe since . Remember how she reacted to his death . We put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been something worse . " " You 're not suggesting that she killed him ? " " As a hypothesis . " Trask shook his head impatiently . " Even putting it hypothetically , it 's pretty hard to swallow about a lady like her . " " What kind of a lady is she ? Do you know her ? " " I 've met her , that 's about all . But hell , Gordon Sable 's one of the top lawyers in the city . " The politician latent in every elected official was rising to the surface and blurring Trask 's hard , clear attitudes . I said : " That does n't put his wife above suspicion . Have you questioned her ? " " No . " Trask became explanatory , as though he felt that he had missed a move : " I have n't been able to get to her . Sable was opposed , and the head-shrinkers backed him up . They say she should n't be questioned on painful subjects . She 's been borderline psychotic since the killing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Howell 's her personal doctor , is n't he ? " " He is . As a matter of fact , I tried to get to her through Howell . He was dead set against it , and as long as it looked like an open-and-shut case , I did n't press the point . " " Howell should be ready to change his mind . Did you say he 's somewhere around the courthouse ? " " Yeah , he 's down in Communications . But wait a minute , Archer . " Trask rose and came around the desk . " This is a touchy business , and you do n't want to hang too much weight on the Lemberg brothers ' story . They 're not disinterestedwitnesses . " " They do n't know enough to invent the story , either . "  | " Schwartz and his lawyers do . " " Are we back on the Schwartz kick again ? " " You were the one that got me on it in the first place . You were convinced that the Culligan killing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe . We 'll let the facts decide when they all come out . But if you were wrong , you could be wrong again . " Trask punched me in the stomach in a friendly way . " How about that , Archer ? " His telephone chirped , and he lifted the receiver . I could n't make out the words that came scratchily over the wire , but I saw their effect on Trask . His body stiffened , and his face seemed to grow larger . " I 'll use my Aero Squadron , " he said finally , " and I ought to be there in two hours . But do n't sit around waiting for me . " He slammed down the receiver and reached for the coat draped over the back of his chair . " They made the red Thunderbird , " he said . " Fredericks abandoned it in San Mateo . They were just going to put the word on the teletype when they got my call . " " Where in San Mateo ? " " Parking-lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train into San Francisco . " " Are you flying up ? " " Yeah , I 've had a volunteer pilot standing by all morning . Ride along with us if you want . He has a four-passenger Beechcraft . " " Thanks , I 've had enough flying to last me for a while . You did n't ask them to check Fredericks 's alibi . " " I forgot , " Trask said lightly . " I 'll take it up with Frederickspersonally . " He seemed glad to be leaving Alice Sable in my lap.  |p210THE  communications center of the courthouse was a windowless room on the basement level , full of the chatter and whine of short-wave radio signals . Dr. Howell was sitting with his head down in front of a quiet teletype machine . He raised his head abruptly when I spoke to him . His face was gray in the white overhead light : " So here you are . While you 've been junketing around the country at my expense , she 's gone away with him . Do you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . The two deputies monitoring the radios looked at him and then at each other . One of them said : " If you two gentlemen want to talk in private , this is no place to do it . " " Come outside , " I said to Howell : " You 're not accomplishinganything here . They 'll be picked up soon , do n't worry . " He sat in inert silence . I wanted to get him away from the teletype machine before the message from San Mateo hit it . It would send him off to the Bay area , and I had a use for him here : " Doctor , is Alice Sable still under your care ? " He looked up questioningly . " Yes . " " Is she still in the nursing home ? " " Yes . I should try to get out there today . " He brushed his forehead with his fingertips . " I 've been neglecting my patients , I 'm afraid . " " Come out there with me now . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to help us terminate this case , and help us reach your daughter . "  |p211He  rose , but stood irresolute beside the teletype machine . Sheila 's defection had robbed him of his force . I took hold of his elbow and steered him out into the basement corridor . Once moving , he went ahead of me up the iron stairs into the hot white noon . His Chevrolet was in the county parking-lot . He turned to me as he started the engine : " How can Mrs. Sable help us to find Sheila ? " " I 'm not certain she can . But she was involved with Culligan , the Fredericks boy 's probable partner in the conspiracy . She may know more about Theo Fredericks than anyone else does . " " She never said a word about him to me . " " Has she been talking to you about the case ? " He said after some hesitation : " Not being a practicingpsychiatrist , I have n't encouraged that line of discussionwith her . The matter has come up , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mental condition . " " Can you be more specific ? " " I prefer not to . You know the ethics of my profession . The doctor-patient relationship is sacrosanct . " " So is human life . Do n't forget a man was murdered . We have evidence that Mrs. Sable knew Culligan before he came to Santa Teresa . She was also a witness to his death . Anything she has to say about it may be very significant . " " Not if her memory of the event is delusional . " " Does she have delusions on the subject ? " " She has indeed . Her account does n't agree with the actual event as we know it . I 've gone into this with Trask , and there 's no doubt whatever that a thug named Lemberg stabbed the man . " " There 's a good deal of doubt , " I said . " The Sheriff just took a statement from Lemberg . A Reno gambler sent Lembergto collect money from Alice Sable , and maybe rough her up a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was shot in the process , left him unconscious on the ground . He claims that somebody else did the knifing after he left . " Howell 's face underwent a curious change . His eyes becameharder and brighter . He was n't looking at me , or at anything external . The lines around his eyes and at the cornersof his mouth curved and deepened , as if he was being forced to look against his will at something horrible . " But Trask said Lemberg was undeniably guilty . " " Trask was wrong . We all were . " " Do you honestly mean to say that Alice Sable has been speaking the truth all along ? " " I do n't know what she 's been saying , Doctor . You do . " " But Trenchard and the other psychiatrists were convinced that her self-accusations were fantasies . They had me convinced . " " What does she accuse herself of ? Does she blame herself for Culligan 's death ? " Howell sat over the wheel in silence . He had been shaken , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality closed up again : " You have no right to cross-examine me about the intimateaffairs of one of my patients . " " I 'm afraid I have to , Doctor . If Alice Sable murdered Culligan , there 's no way you can cover up for her . I 'm surprised you want to . You 're not only breaking the law , you 're violating the ethics you set such store by . " " I 'll be the judge of my own ethics , " he said in a strained voice . He sat and wrestled with his unstated problem . His gaze was inward and glaring . Sweat-drops studded his forehead . I got some sense of the empathy he felt for his patient . Even his daughter was forgotten . " She has confessed the murder to you , Doctor ? "  |p213Slowly  his eyes remembered me again . " What did you say ? " " Has Mrs. Sable confessed Culligan 's murder ? " " I 'm going to ask you not to question me further . " Abruptly , he released the emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing home , hoping my patience might earn me an interview with Alice Sable herself . A gray-haired nurse unlocked the front door , and smiled with special intensity at Howell . " Good morning , Doctor . We 're a little late this morning . " " I 'm having to skip my regular calls today . I do want to see Mrs. Sable . " " I 'm sorry , Doctor , she 's already gone . " " Gone where , for heaven 's sake ? " " Mr. Sable took her home this morning , did n't you know ? He said it was all right with you . " " It certainly is not . You do n't release disturbed patients without specific orders from a doctor . Have n't you learned that yet , nurse ? " Before she could answer , Howell turned on his heel and started back to his car . I had to run to catch him . " The man 's a fool ! " he cried above the roar of the engine . " He ca n't be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . She 's dangerous to herself and other people . " I said when we were underway : " Was she dangerous to Culligan , Doctor ? " His answer was a sigh which seemed to rise from the center of his body . The outskirts of Santa Teresa gave place to open country . The hills of Arroyo Park rose ahead of us . With his eyes on the green hills , Howell said : " The poor wretch of a woman told me that she killed him . And I did n't have sense enough to believe her . Somehow her story did n't ring true to me . I was convinced that it was fantasy masking the actual event . "  | " Is that why you would n't let Trask talk to her ? " " Yes . The present state of the law being what it is , a doctorhas a duty to protect his patients , especially the semipsychoticones . We ca n't run off to the police with every sick delusion they come up with . But in this case , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're not sure . " " I 'm no longer sure about anything . " " Exactly what did she say to you ? " " She heard the sounds of a struggle , two men fighting and calling each other names . A gun went off . She was terrified , of course , but she forced herself to go to the front door . Culligan was lying on the lawn . The other man was just driving away in the Jaguar . When he was out of sight , she went out to Culligan . Her intention was to help him , she said , but she saw his knife in the grass . She picked it up and  --  used it . " We had reached the foot of Sable 's hill . Howell wrestled his car up the climbing curves . The tires shuddered and screeched like lost souls under punishment . ( C4 ( C4CO ( C ' ( C ( C ( C ( mcocc chapter 2 9cc  --  cc ( C ' ( C.cc  - -  +SABLE must have heard the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He opened the door at once . His bloodshot eyes began to water in the strong sunlight , and he sneezed . " Where is your wife ? " Howell said . " In her own room , where she belongs . There was so much noise and confusion in the nursing home  --  "  | " I want to see her . " " I do n't think so , Doctor . I understand you 've been grilling her about the unfortunate crime that occurred on our premises . It 's been most disturbing to Alice . You told me yourself that she should n't be forced to talk about it . " " She brought up the subject of her own accord . I demand to be allowed to see her . " " Demand , Doctor ? How can you do that ? I should make it clear , I suppose , that I 'm terminating your services as of now . I intend to hire a new crew of doctors , and find a place where Alice can rest in peace . " The phrase set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't hire doctors , Sable , and you do n't fire them . " " Your law is rusty . Perhaps you should hire a lawyer . You 're certainly going to need one if you try to force your way into my house . " Sable 's voice was controlled , but queerly atonal . " I have a duty to my patient . You had no right to remove her from nursing care . " " From your third-degree methods , you mean ? Let me remind you , if you need reminding , that anything Alice has said to you is privileged . I employed you and the others in my capacity as her lawyer in order to have your assistance in determining certain facts . Is that clear ? If you communicatethese facts or alleged facts to anyone , official or unofficial , I 'll sue you for criminal libel . " " You 're talking doubletalk , " I said . " You wo n't be suing anybody . " " Wo n't I , though ? You 're in roughly the same position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain investigation , and ordered you to communicate the results orally to me . Any further communication is a breach of contract . Try it out , and by God I 'll have your license . " I did n't know if he was legally right . I did n't care . Whenp216he started to swing the door shut , I set my foot against it : " We 're coming in , Sable . " " I think not , " his queer new voice said . He reached behind the door and stepped back with a gun in his hands . It was a long , heavy gun , a deer rifle with a telescopic sight . He raised it deliberately . I looked directly into the muzzle , at the clean , glinting spiral of the rifling . Sable curled his finger on the trigger , and cuddled the polished stock against his cheek . His face had a fine glaze on it , like porcelain . I realized that he was ready to kill me . " Put it down , " Howell said . He moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the line of fire : " Put it down , Gordon . You 're not yourself , you 're feeling upset , you 're terribly worried about Alice . But we 're your friends , we 're Alice 's friends , too . We want to help you both . " " I have no friends , " Sable said . " I know why you 're here , why you want to talk to Alice . And I 'm not going to let you . " " Do n't be silly , Gordon . You ca n't look after a sick woman by yourself . I know you do n't care about your personal safety , but you have to consider Alice 's safety . She needs looking after , Gordon . So put it down now , let me in to see her . " " Get back . I 'll shoot . " Sable 's voice was a high sharp yell . His wife must have heard it . From deep inside the house , she cried out in answer : " No ! " Sable blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of a precipice . Behind him his wife 's crying went on , punctuated by resounding blows and then a crash of glass . Caught between impossible pressures , Sable half-turnedp217toward the noise . The rifle swung sideways with his movement . I went in past Howell and got one hand on the gunbarreland the other on the knot of Sable 's tie . I heaved . Man and rifle came apart . Sable thudded against the wall and almost fell . He was breathing hard . His hair was in his eyes . He bore a strange resemblance to an old woman peering out through the fringes of a matted white wig . I opened the breech of the rifle . While I was unloading it , running feet slapped the pavement of the inner court . Alice Sable appeared at the end of the hallway . Her light hair was ruffled , and her nightgown was twisted around her slender body . Blood ran down over her naked foot from a cut in her leg . " I hurt myself on the window , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the glass . " " Did you have to break it ? " Sable made an abrupt , threateningmovement toward her . Then he remembered us , and sweetened his tone : " Go back to your room , dear . You do n't want to run around half-dressed in front of visitors . " " Dr. Howell is n't a visitor . You came to fix it where I hurt myself , did n't you ? " She moved uncertainly toward the doctor . He went to meet her with his hands out . " Of course I did . Come back to your room with me and we 'll fix it now . " " But I do n't want to go back in there . I hate it in there , it depresses me . Peter used to visit me in there . " " Be quiet ! " Sable said . She moved behind the doctor , making her body small as if to claim a child 's irresponsibility . From the protection of Howell 's shoulder , she peered sadly at her husband : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , hush it up . But what 's the use , Gordon ? Everybody knows about me and Peter . Dr. Howell knows . I made a clean breast of it to him . "  |p218Her  hand went to her breast , and fingered the rosebuds embroidered on her nightgown . Her heavy gaze swung to me . " This man knows about me , too , I can see it in his face . " " Did you kill him , Mrs. Sable ? " " Do n't answer , " Sable said . " But I want to confess . I 'll feel better then , wo n't I ? " Her smile was bright and agonized . It faded , leaving its lines in her face and her teeth bare : " I did kill him . The fellow in the black car knocked him out , and I went out and stabbed him . " Her hand jerked downward from her breast , clenched on an imaginary knife . Her husband watched her like a pokerplayer . " Why did you do it ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got sick of him . Now it 's time for me to take my punishment . I killed , and I deserve to die . " The tragic words had an unreal quality . She spoke them like a life-size puppet activated by strings and used by a voice that did n't belong to her . Only her eyes were her own , and they contained a persistent stunned innocence . " I deserve to die , " she repeated . " Do n't I , Gordon ? " He flushed up darkly . " Leave me out of this . " " But you said  --  " " I said nothing of the sort . " " You 're lying , Gordon , " she chided him . Perhaps there was an undertone of malice in her voice . " You told me after all my crimes that I deserved to die . And you were right . I lost your good money gambling and went with another man and now on top of it all I 'm a murderer . " Sable appealed to Howell : " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ill and hurt . It 's inconceivable that you should let her be questioned . This man is n't even a policeman  --  " " I 'll take the responsibility for what I do , " I said . " Mrs. Sable , do you remember stabbing Peter Culligan ? "  |p219She  raised one hand to her forehead , pushing back her hair as if it got in the way of her thoughts . " I do n't remember exactly , but I must have . " " Why do you say you must have , if you do n't remember ? " " Gordon saw me . " I looked at Sable . He would n't look at me . He stood against the wall , trying to merge with the wall . " Gordon was n't here , " I said . " He was at Mrs. Galton 's house when you telephoned . " " But he came . He came right over . Peter was lying there on the grass for a long time . He was making a funny noise , it sounded like snoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him breathe . " " You remember all this , but you do n't remember stabbing him ? " " I must have blanked out on that part . I 'm always blankingout on things , ask Gordon . " " I 'm asking you , Mrs. Sable . " " Let me think . I remember , I slid my hand down under his shirt , to see if his heart was beating properly . I could feel it there thumping and jumping . You 'd think it was a little animal trying to get out . The hair on his chest was scratchy , like wire . " Sable made a noise in his throat . " What did you do then ? " I said . " I  --  nothing . I just sat for a while and looked at him and his poor old beatup face . I put my arms around him and tried to coax him awake . But he went on snoring at me . He was still snoring when Gordon got there . Gordon was angry , catching me with him like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window . " Suddenly her face was incandescent . " I did n't kill him . It was n't me out there . It was Gordon , and I watched him from the window . He picked up Peter 's knife and pushed it into his stomach . " Her clenched hand repeated its down/ward gesture , striking her own soft abdomen . " The blood spurted out and ran red on the grass . It was all red and green . " Sable thrust his head forward . The rest of his body , even his arms and hands , remained stuck to the wall : " You ca n't believe her . She 's hallucinating again . " His wife seemed not to hear him . Perhaps she was tuned to a higher frequency , singing like salvation in her head . Tears streamed from her eyes : " I did n't kill him . " " Hush now . " Howell quieted her face against his shoulder . " This is the truth , is n't it ? " I said . " It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers were fantasy after all . This account is much more circumstantial . I 'd say she 's taken a long step toward reality . " " She 's crazier than she ever was , " Sable said . " If you think you can use this against me , you 're crazier than she is . Do n't forget I 'm a lawyer  --  " " Is that what you are  --  a lawyer ? " Howell turned his back on Sable and spoke to his wife : " Come on , Alice , we 'll put a bandage on that cut and you can get some clothes on . Then we 'll take a little ride , back to the nice place with the other ladies . " " It is n't a nice place , " she said . Howell smiled down at her . " That 's the spirit . Keep saying what you really think and know , and we 'll get you out of there to stay . But not for a while yet , eh ? " " Not for a while yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other hand to Sable . " The key to your wife 's room . You wo n't be needing it . " Sable produced a flat brass key which Howell accepted from him without a word . The doctor walked Alice Sable down the hallway toward the court.  |p221GORDON  SABLE watched them go with something approaching relief . The bright expectancy had left his eyes . He had had it . " I would n't have done it , " he said , " if I 'd known what I know now . There are factors you do n't foresee  --  the factor of human change , for example . You think you can handle anything , that you can go on forever . But your strength wears away under pressure . A few days , or a few weeks , and everything looks different . Nothing seems worth struggling for . It all goes blah . " He made a loose bumbling sound with his lips : " All gone to bloody blah . So here we are . " " Why did you kill him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying and moaning over him , trying to wake him up with kisses . It made me sick to death . " " Do n't tell me it was a sudden crime of passion . You must have known about them long before . " " I do n't deny that . " Sable shifted his stance , as if to preparehimself for a shift in his story . " Culligan picked her up in Reno last summer . She went there to divorce me , but she ended up on a gambling spree with Culligan egging her on . No doubt he collected commissions on the money she lost . She lost a great deal , all the ready money I could raise . When it was gone , and her credit was exhausted , he let her share his apartment for a while . I had to go there and beg her to come home with me . She did n't want to come . I had to pay him to send her away . " I did n't doubt the truth of what he was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of splasher beacons to join up with the other eleven groups of our attack . We were at about nine thousand feet , and it was time for me to take a turn around the ship and make a manual check of everyone 's oxygen-hose connections  --  a practice which Marrow had instituted after a navigator on the man-killing ship , Chug Bug , had died of anoxia at twenty-four thousand feet . I made the rounds , exchanging shouted greetings with some of the men , working silently at the stations of others . I left the nose till last . In the navigator 's compartment , Clint Haverstraw was bent over the right-hand side of his desk watching the radio-compass indicator , but when I leaned over him he swiveled his chair and looked up at me . Clint had the cleanliness madness , and his compartment was fussily housekept , pencils lashed with bowknots , the driftmeter hood weirdly shined with shoe polish . I remembered that early in our tour we 'd had groundschooldinghy drill one day , and Marrow got Clint 's goat talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need these dinghies , " Buzz said , " to ride the mud around here . " And , seeing Haverstraw'sloathing of our dirty , disordered life welling up , Buzz took off . The clean war of the Air Force . No marching , no foxholes , no mud . Clint wanted a bath right on the spot , by the time Buzz got through . Marrow was merciless . Most of the time , though , Marrow was gentle and protective with Clint , whose trick mind for numbersdazzled Buzz . Haverstraw was really Marrow 's toy . The favoritismwas clinched when Haverstraw came up with a most unexpectedtalent  --  for baseball . This was revealed to us on April Fools ' Day , after we had been shown The Body for the first time , when , in the late mildness of that spring afternoon , a bunch of us organized a pickup hardball game . Haverstraw said he 'd like to play third . Marrow insisted , of course , on pitching , and the opponents began pasting him , and Haverstraw made some stops that took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like telegrams . Marrowp101became ecstatic . " See that wing ? " he shouted . And after the game he said to Clint , " You got to go out for the Group ball team , son . We got to keep those God-damn sergeants off that ball team . " Clint never meant to do any harm but often managed to do some , and now , at his desk , after we had shouted over the engine roar a few commonplace complaints against this mission we were on , he turned the full glare of his insensitivity in my direction and cried out , " I hear Marrow 's f  --  ing your girl . " I could n't believe my ears ; the vibration of the motors suddenlyseemed to get into my knee joints . " What ? " I shouted . Clint repeated his happy announcement . " Who the hell told you that ? " " Three guesses . " Clint gave me a grin like the chrome grille on the radiator of a Buick . Marrow , then , was already making a story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at that , and probably purveying it , as he did his many accounts of his swordsmanship , in the officers ' club , buying anyone he could collar a beer or a coke so he could have a bonded audience , and letting the others talk until , at a general pause , he would lean back in his chair and get off a fine lead sentence . " Did you ever clamp it to your co-pilot 's best girl ? " Something like that . And all a lie . In the past , when I had Iistened to Buzz 's stories of his epic successes in bed , I had always thought of his girls as figures in a homemade myth , not as flesh and blood and breathing reputation , but now I saw that the coin he spent so freely was human , and I was in a rage standing there looking at Clint 's delighted face  --  but my rage was mixed with a sadness for Marrow , too . I saw for the first time , after what Daphne had told me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales of his prowess . All lies ? There was some insatiable repetitive driving need in him . I turned my back on Haverstraw 's table , and on him , and made my way in a daze of thinking and anger back up to the cockpitand sat in my seat and looked over at Buzz . He had buckled his helmet and buttoned the collar of his suit , and he was ready for whatever the day would offer , and like the cadaver on the beach at Pamonassett , he seemed to be looking into distant times and spaces  --  only of course he was simply scanning the sky for signs of our other groups ; very much alive , damn his alert green eyes.  |p103I  shuddered . I think I must have wanted to kill Buzz . Yes , I wanted to kill . I , who had such a horror of killing . Who had guiltfraughtnightmares about our work of killing civilians : the faces looking upward , in the dream , and I among them , watching the killing coming down from the sky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with upturned Picasso faces , and the horrible feeling of being rooted to the ground and unable to run away , and yet knowing that it was also I up above who had dropped the killing that was falling on also me below . To overcome this fearful anger I , too , looked into the distance . There were broken clouds below us , but around us the sky was porcelain . We were flying southeastward over Norfolk . I felt somewhatcalmer . Suddenly I had a new understanding of one of Marrow 's favorite stories about his own flying  --  about the dive that had really scared him . While testing at Mildress he had flown as a stunt pilot in several movies : Through the Thunderhead , Wings Over the Desert , Mail Run , and some others . " This one movie , when they were making it , " Marrow once had told us , while we were still in training , and he had repeated the story many times , " they said to me , Go up , stunt as crazy as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did what they said , and I did n't ask any questions ; they paid me to fly , not to yap at ' cm . When the picture came out , I bought me a ticket and went in to see it , and I found out it was about this pilot , he got p  --  ed off at his wife , so he went up to spite her with some wild flying that was going to pay her back , he figured . I could see where I took over with the stunting , I mean , the flying got good . I looked around the theater at the faces to see how they were taking it . Boy , was I scaring some of those women ! Anyway , I looked back at the screen , and I was going into this dive , and diving was my specialty ; it was real clean . Then I noticed , God , I was getting low , and I did n't remember I went that low , and I still was n't pulling out . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late for me to pull out . I shouted right out in the theater , the people must 've thought I was off my trolley . The lousy plane crashed and the pilot was killed , and I was almost dead myself . They should have told me about what they pasted onto the end of my dive . . . . " And Marrow laughed at the memory , with too much laughter.  | " All right , " Marrow said , " prepare to go on oxygen . " We were at ten thousand feet , and it was twelve minutes past noon . I unhooked my mask and ran a hand across my jaw ; I 'd shaved too early  --  nearly ten hours before  --  and I could see that I was going to have stubble trouble , as Handown had once called it , under the tightness of an oxygen mask . Colonel Bins was taking huge easing turns , so that two groups behind us could attach themselves to us . Now I was in my mask , cut off from the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for an oxygen check , ticking off the numbers from nose to tail , and each man answered in his way . I said , " O.K. " Marrow always said , " I 'm here , son . " At splasher six , where our task force was to achieve its final assembly , we all made an enormous S of two semi-circles , so that the whole formation could close up , and on the way around to the right I looked out and , seeing group after group tacked closely onto the great loop , I had a sense of our strength , our growing strength . It was always a thrilling sight to see a strike tighten into ranks , and that morning it was breathtaking . " Four aborts , " Farr said . He meant from our Group . " Lucky bastards . " After the huge turns , which took nearly ten minutes , we unwoundon a southwesterly course , sailing over the Suffolk downs for Orfordness , where we would break with the friendly coast . We were all put together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about a hundred ships each , which were flying in train twelve minutes apart ; each task force consisted of two combat wings , one behind the other , five minutes apart ; each combat wing comprised three groups of eighteen ships each . The groups had now joined up into these combat wings , slanting wedges exactly like the basic vee in which our three planes , The Body , Finah Than Dinah , and ExpendableVI , were stacked in our element , and like that in which the three squadrons of six ships each in our Group , Bins ' , Jonas ' , and Holdreth 's , were formed up in their turn . The combat wingp104had a lead group of eighteen , a high group of eighteen stacked up behind to the left , and a low group of eighteen astern , below , and to the right . We in The Body , in the second element of the lead squadron of the lead group of the second combat wing of the second task force , were about three quarters of the way back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed than that sounds , for thanks to the gaps between combat wings , we were right out on the nose of the last big fighting box of the strike . All that shielded us from the very nose was Colonel Bins ' element , Angel Tread , Erector Set , and Gruesome Twosome . On the way to Orfordness something happened which was very curious , which struck me at the time as being strange , but whose meaning I did not then even try to fathom , for I was busy thinking of other things . Junior Sailen came up on interphone . " Ball turret to engineer , " he said , though we usually had none of that radioman'smanualkind of formality on our ship , Roger , over , and out , but simply spoke to each other by name and shut up when done . " Roger , " which was supposed to mean , " I understand you , " was occasionally used by our sergeants with a heavy accent on the secondsyllable to express mock alacrity , and for a while , during Marrow'sphase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rodney , " which Buzz had said was the R.A.F. equivalent for " Roger . " On the whole we were sloppy because Marrow thought it was manly to be raunchy . " Cut that kid stuff , " Marrow had said on an early mission when our first radioman , Kowalski , had gone formal on us . Anyway , Sailen said , " Ball turret to engineer . " " What 's up , Junior ? " Handown said . " Come down here a minute , " Sailen said . Junior Sailen was a tiny guy ; one look at him made me feel burly . He was five feet and one inch tall , weighed a hundred fifteen  --  and a good thing that he was so tiny , too , because his stationin combat was just a small plastic bubble full of machinery down there under the ship , where even he had to sit with his knees drawn up like an embryo . He was strong for his size , and well coordinated , and needed to be , because it took a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sperry K-2 power turrets around , traversingthrough range and deflection at the same time , by means ofp105feather-delicate touches on the hand grips of the guns , to get a bead on a German fighter coming from underneath at a skidding angle . And though he had this litheness and quickness and was twenty-one years old , we all treated him as a baby , and he loved it . He was our mascot . He told me once that his father had died early and that as a kid he 'd been brought up by a brother ten years older than he , and that from the time his brother had left home he 'd always been restless ; he would take a job , and there 'd be no one to look out for him , and he 'd quit in a few days and mope around the house , and then take another job , and the same thing would happen . In our crew he was in clover  --  nine older brothers , who fought each other to take care of him . Even Farr : " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take a p  --  without getting permission from one of us . Marrow hated not being in the know , and when Sailen asked Handown to come down to his turret , Buzz cut in right away , saying , " What 's itching you down there , Junior ? " " Nothing , " Junior said . " What do you mean , nothing ' ? Wha 'd you call the engineer down for if it was nothing ? " Usually at this point Junior Sailen would have been eating out of Marrow 's hand , but this time he seemed inspired with gall and he said , " It 's just between Handown and me . " I was amazed at this : it made me think there must be somethingseriously wrong in the turret about which Sailen was too scared to tell Marrow , for fear it might mean turning back . Handown had an amazing knack for getting things straight in the plane . In the heaviest of action he could retain the cool , systematic logic of a case-hardened mechanic on a trouble-shooting quest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of their probability . He had saved us all more than once . I think that what made me sure something was wrong in the turret was Sailen 's having started the whole thing off in that formal way , using the word " engineer " in calling Handown . Power of suggestion . Rebuffed by the tiny man , Marrow went wild . He loosed a fantastic torrent of obscenities against sergeants , which reminded me , in its excesses and its vileness , of his tirade the night he had gone for a dancing lesson at the Red Cross Aeroclub.  |p106And  what came out now was distorted in sound , because a throat mike could n't take more than a certain amount of volume . When it was over , Sailen said with astounding quiet courage , " You must have the wrong number , sir . No one here by that name . " " Listen , you God-damn yellow-bellied mouse ... " Handown was apparently back at his post in the upper turret , because he now spoke one word that cut Marrow short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is this all about ? " Marrow shouted . " I gave Junior a loan of my lucky dice couple days ago , " Handowncalmly said . " He thought maybe I 'd want ' em today . Gave ' em back . " I had no idea whether that was the truth or whether Neg was covering for the Little Brother . As we approached the coast of East Anglia the broken and scattered cumulus clouds , far beneath us , lay like scraps of lint on the floor of a careless home . The sky above us was clear . We could see for fifteen miles all around . The sun was already behind us , and ahead , low in the sky , a slender moon was rising , and the Channel beneath had the cold blue-gray cast of finished steel . We went over Orfordness at twenty-six minutes after one , at fourteen thousand feet . From the coast onward our briefed cruisingspeed was one hundred sixty miles per hour , indicated air speed , and , as Colonel Bins adjusted to that rate , Marrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes out Marrow told me to fly awhile , and I took the controls . There were no problems now ; just a matter of keeping hooked snugly underneath the first element . This kind of flying had at long last become second nature to me . About fifty miles out over the Channel I remembered to remind Butcher Lamb to cut off the IFF . Erector Set overhead was the first ship I could see test-firing her guns , flinging out momentary puffs of smoke , pale blue against the deeper blue above ; then our ship began to shiver , and through my earphones and the engines ' roar Ip107could hear the crackle of short bursts as our men shook out their barrels and then left their guns cocked and on fire against the dangerwe were so soon to face . Prien barked off an oxygen check , and afterwards Haverstraw sang out , " On flight plan , " stretching out the pla  --  a  --  a  --  n , like an echo among hills . That meant that we were on course and on time ; the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of a watchman in the night , a cry of defiance against would-be thieves , murderers , disturbers of the peace . There came back to me , then , a warning I had indirectly taken , the day before , from something Daphne had said  --  that men with Marrow 's taint might , in an extremity of facing defeat of some kind or other , try to destroy everyone around them , along with themselves . She had not put it so explicitly , of course . She had been talking about an R.A.F. pilot she had once loved  --  a man much like Marrow , she had said ; the warning I had inferred myself . I thought there was some analogy between the tale of the last hours of her R.A.F. boyfriend and the legend of Samson 's death , and I was not sure that the fact that Samson was surrounded by enemies when he brought the roof of the temple down deprived the analogy of its force . I felt , at any rate , a sort of chill of bracing myself for whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these thoughts . For a few minutes , as we climbed through the eighteen-thousand-foot mark over the Channel , all the planes of the great attack began to give off short , non-persistent trails of condensation . Each ship was like a huge brush leaving a stroke of whitewash on the ceiling of the afternoon . Fortunately  --  for beautiful though the contrails were , they were a menace to planes in formation and a cover for enemy fighters  --  they faded quickly away , and as we ascended they no longer formed . Far ahead , over the enemy-held land , higher than we yet were , I could see a thin plate of cirrus clouds , and it briefly crossed my mind that that cover might cause us trouble . Directly under it , like an indistinct shadow , I could just make out the dark line of the enemy coast . What was ahead was like a huge mouth , the upper lip of vapor , the lower lip of earth . In between , on our course that would lead us to be swallowed in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray uncertainty , an atmosphere almost opaque.  |p108Slee|p  is a mystery . That was a night I should have spent going round and round on a barbecue spit , but not at all . I dived asleep before Marrow even came in the room , and I was in a black void from then until nine thirty in the morning , when Sully wakenedme , shaking my shoulder , saying , " Breakfast at ten . Briefing at ten thirty . Out , you slug . " No . Not again . Not three days in a row . It was not a dream . Sully persisted . " I mean it , stupid . Get up . And get your fat-ass pilot up while you 're at it . " When Marrow finally came to , he was so furious at Wing he seemed to have forgotten all about the night before and Daphne . They briefed us , and we went out to the ships , and we taxied , and we had three postponements , and then they scrubbed the strike . In our weeks at Pike Rilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen many a scrubbing , but this was our first direct knowledge of how pernicious these cancellations were . They had got us believing we really were going on our third in a row . They 'd worked us up to the pitch of reluctant willingness known as slight cramps in the bowels , and they 'd made us wait two hours , missing lunch , and then , like puppeteers grown tired of the weights on their fingers , they 'd let us down.  |p109In  the truck , going back in , Marrow was pleasant to me . I was amazed . He seemed to have no hard feelings whatsoever about Daphne . Did n't say a word . It was four thirty when we got to our room . I washed up and changed into O.D. 's and went to the PX and asked the tech behind the barred window for a box of three condoms . For once I almost had to agree with Marrow about sergeants : always a razz . " Officers ' dance last night , sir ? " this tech said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some miracle ingredient . " Congrats . " On the speedy work , he must have meant . I was n't a great hand at this particular transaction , and I could feel a blush start at the back of my skull and push out around my hairline , so that my face felt sheathed with blotting paper , but I 'd picked up enough of wising to say , " They 're a present for those bastards up at Wing , so the Situation wo n't get pregnant . " " Have a nice ride , " the tech said . " Sir . " I drew a pass and caught the liberty run to Cambridge at , as they said , eighteen hundred hours  --  appropriate that day , because it had seemed at least that many from Sully 's fracture of my peace in the morning until now , six o'clock , when with a snarl of poorly maintained gears our grown-toy R.A.F. bus took off into a hazesoftenedsunset . I had been in a strange fluctuating mood all day , even during Wing 's interminable hoax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aglow and luminous at times , cold and dark between . In the periods when the coils were lit I had rehearsed Daphne as a presence : the swift rushes of eagerness to please in her expression as she sat and talked with the big ox , Braddock ; her left hand tremblingaround her compact , as if holding a living bird ; her sincerely hospitable face as it met its twin in the small round mirror , almost saying , " Oh , it 's you ! Delighted to see you , my dear . " Above all her straight look into my eyes . Again and again . I had a sense of wonderat her subtle favoring of me , as if I had been given some leastexpectedhonor  --  been made Mayor of Donkentown just because people trusted my phizz . Then the intervening chill . I wondered how much I had kidded myself about her election of me , for Daphne had , to be honest , made every man look as if he felt chosen . Maybe the reason Marrow was n't sore today was that hep110thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not getting her address , her name , even . Had I been drunk ? No good could come of my challenging Marrow in the very hearth and parlor of his conceit . What in the world was I doing on this bus ? The men in the bus were meanly silent , like released criminals , men pale from living in the shadow of prison walls , oppressed with a feeling of the immensity of the world , yet eager to be in it again , to prove themselves or get revenge . I heard them murmur , one to another , plans for their rehabilitation : Let 's have a beer first , or , Why' n't we wait and see they got a movie house . As for me , I was just going to walk around the streets looking for a face . The square bus ran along at about twenty miles an hour with a whine of a hurtling Spitfire . I saw glimpses in the dusk of the East Anglian farmlands , gently breathing contours under a blanket of mist ; then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two-hundred-foot bumps looming in that flat land like noble distantsierras . Then suddenly we were being dumped out on TrumpingtonStreet . I began with a semblance of system  --  by looking for bright lights , but there were none . My eyes were so wide open I saw nothing . Past a small church into a market square . Faces blank in the caverns of the night . Under a street lamp some students in idiotic truncated academic gowns , not even as long as their suit coats , with mortar caps under their arms . A sound of military boots against a wall . Bicycles , singly and in packs , dangerous as wild dogs . Then I stood opposite the great gate of Trinity College , like a huge , upside-down , four-legged butcher 's chopping block ; what it really was I did not then know . An iron grille was locked . Indeed I had again and again at what must have been college gates an impression of being shut out . I entered lobbies and restaurants and stared in corners ; told headwaiters I was expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had the honor to be thrown out of a gentlemen 's club called , I was given to understand , The Pitt . Daphne had been Pitt 's girl ; I remembered , in a game of hidden treasures in a strange living room , a woman playing the piano very loudly when I got " warm , " near the object of the quest but still unable to see it . I squinted to make out , on plaques on the faces of houses onp111street corners , the names of streets , as if the deficiency of not having an address could be overcome by close concentration . Maid 's Causeway . Petty Cury . Many . I scowled at the doors on Paradise Street , for surely .. . On King 's Parade I saw a middle-aged gentleman , with a face shut tight , jaw shadowy , looking like an F.B.I . man wearing a silk top hat , a cutaway , and striped pants , running headlong down the middle of the street in pursuit of three clearly drunken students in those crazy short gowns like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their eccentricity . For me it was a consolation . We were all in this world together . Long since I should have given up , but I see now that my desireto be near Daphne Whatshername was very , very great . Like a gloomy voyeur I stared in rare un-blacked-out windows for a chance sight of her face . I seemed to hurry faster and faster the more absurd my search became . I saw none of the great sights of the ancient seat of learning , and late , once , in a disturbing open place , I cried out to ask a distant walking man where I was , and he shouted , Jesus College Cricket Ground . I caught the Pike Rilling liberty bus at the Bull on TrumpingtonStreet at eleven o'clock , twenty-three hundred hours  --  uncountablehours since I 'd seen the girl who had said her name was Daphne . I slept hard in the bus , with my head fallen forward and , I guess , bouncing on the bus window ; I had a stiff neck for a week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mission the next morning , and Marrow was still up , and keyed up . " I been looking all over for you , " he said . " Where the hell you been ? " " Bike ride , " I said . " Where the hell you go , Cincinnati ? " " Just around , " I said . " Stopped for a bottle of stout . " " Some bottle , " he said . " You look bushed . " Buzz was really revved up . He said he 'd been investigating " that dish of yours last night . " I was too tired to give a whoop ; he 'd calmly surrendered her to me . Said to be a great piece . Lucky bastard . Something about some sort of tragedy  --  lost an R.A.F. fiance , or some such , no one knew exactly what . Was known to have had several relationships , here and there , Pitt having been the last , but during each one was absolutely monogamous . " Boman ,  |p112you  really hit it lucky if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually glad for me  --  either that , or be was wiring up a booby trap . The next few days were a bad dream  --  exhausting activityand frustration . The morning after I went to Cambridge they scrubbed a mission for the marshaling yards at Amiens ; the morningafter that we had wind , rain , and what the English newspapers call bright intervals , and Colonel Whelan sent us up on a Group practice mission , to tighten up our formation flying , but all we did was dodge the intervals that were n't bright ; the following day he 'd scheduled another practice mission , but someone slipped a cog , and Sully did n't wake any of the fliers in time for the take-off , and Whelan was infuriated and restricted all personnel to the base , pending an investigation of what he deemed to be sabotage of his will . The next day after that they sent us on a prolonged low-level practice mission . That was the morning it came to me that maybe Marrow knew Daphne 's last name , or her telephone number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could have found out that night while I 'd gone to the boys ' room . Only I could n't figure out how to ask him without giving away too much . The practice mission had Marrow in a tizzy . He had connectedtwo things : our being sent on a hedge-hopping practice flight , and an order from Wing , that very morning , that all combat crews were to be given new lectures on security , and he was convinced that they were planning to send us on sneak strikes against heavily defended targets at zero altitude . He was furious . He said Fortresses had been designed in every particular for extreme highaltitudeattacks ; they were n't mosquitoes , they had n't the maneuverabilityor stamina for grasscutting missions . It was true that weather interfered with our usefulness high in the air , but . . . how could a man tiptoe in hip boots ? Marrow fumed away till we got in the air , then suddenly he was transformed , because he saw what our low-lying thunder didp113to the countryside . Flocks of sheep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their open runs  --  all were thrown into panic at our approach . Marrow 's chest expanded . The calm smile of a powerful man spread on his face . The flight gave me curious new sensations , I must admit . When we went across woodlands , treetops whipped past my ears , it seemed , and looking out my side window I saw the intricate patterns of bare branches , like the orderedbarbs , barbules , and barbicels of great feathers , and I saw a wagon in a stone-fenced yard , a car in a road , a clutch of thatched roofs like the backs of huddled badgers  --  all in instantaneous camera-shutterglimpses . That was what made the mission eerie for me : the flickering sensation , sizes and shapes confused in my bewilderedeyes . But for Marrow the thrill of power grew and grew , and finally he said , " You take her , Boman , I got to see this closer . " He unstrappedhimself and crawled down in the greenhouse and he plugged in on Brindt 's interphone and began giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the impact of our roaring threat on all living beings below . He cackled as he talked , the swift laugh of seeing pie thrown into faces . " Listen , you guys . . . " He told of a farm crew , spreading manure from a wagon , cringing , one or two running blindly nowhere , at the sound of our hundred engines . Then he almost killed himself laughing  --  " you should 've seen this "  --  when the driver of a tractor threw a gear to halt his machine and tumbled off and sought shelter under his slender vehicle . Out of nowhere , as I strained to stay in formation and maintainminimal altitude , I had a thought . I would ask Clint Haverstrawabout Daphne 's number . Haverstraw , the math demon , had a trick system for rememberingphone numbers , and during the phases , back at home , at first in fun and then for ready reference , Marrow had filed in Haverstraw 's head several score , maybe a couple of hundred , telephone numbers of various women he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Kingdom was also beginning to figure in the catalogue . Sometimes , to show Haverstraw off , Marrowwould just give a first name . " Margie . " " Which one ? "  | " That 's right ! S  --  , I forgot , there are three of ' em . The blonde . " " Denver . Decatur six , four four oh nine . " " You see ? " Marrow would say , looking around at the audience . " The son of a bitch has a f  --  ing machine in his head . Too bad he ca n't put it to some good use . Like , say , navigating a ship . " The only number Haverstraw could n't remember was that of his own best girl . Marrow had found that out somehow , and alwaysannounced it to the audience , and you 'd just be thinking that this was a gag when Clint would blush . I could n't wait for the mission to be over . We flew north over soft heathery hills and turned back before we reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we bump into a stuffed cloud , up there where they had real hills . I was very busy flying and began to have cramps in the right cheek of my fanny . We finally got home , and of course Marrow came up and took the controls away from his idiot co-pilot to be in charge of the landing . That was all right with me . I was drenched with sweat . They had an interrogation which was also a sort of critique , and on the way out I managed to catch Haverstraw for a minute . Clint would n't have seen Daphne , because he had n't been to the dance ; he was soldering the connections of a homemade radio receiver in his room that night . I asked him if Marrow had registeredwith him the number of a dame called Daphne from Cambridge . Iaverstraw said , " The Marrow Meat File is not open to unauthorizedpersonnel . " Sometimes I have a hard time taking a joke , especially when it 's on me . I did n't want to sound too eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take a slash , " Cut the crap . I got to know . " Clint saw that he had me on the ropes . " I ca n't remember any of that stuff only when Marrow asks me . It 's like he 's got me hypnotized . " I was afraid that if I pushed any harder Clint would tell Marrowhow riled up I was about someone named Daphne , so I dropped it.  |p115We  had eight days of maddening weather after that  --  not bad enough to keep us on the ground but not good enough to fly missions . The older hands , particularly those who had nearly completedtheir tours , began to get fidgety at having no mission scheduledand Marrow took us up a couple of times but really did n't drill us on anything ; he just wanted to fly . On the eighth of those mizzling days , the thirtieth of April  --  I have a good reason for remembering the date  --  a batch of replacementscame in , and although we of The Body had only been on two missions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me realize how raw , how childish , we must have looked when we had first arrived . After supper we were sitting around , and Marrow said to big Braddock , jerking his head toward a chilled clump of new officers , " What say we flak ' em up a bit ? " " Why do n't we go over and do it to the new sergeant gunners ? That 's more fun . " " Let 's warm up here , " Marrow said . So we drifted across the room , and Marrow began the hazing in the most natural way in the world , because of course the new boys began asking questions . They got onto the subject of friendly fighter escorts , and Marrow said , " Under eighteen thousand the Spit-5 with the clipped wingtips , that 's a capable ship . It 's given us a lot of support , would n't you say , Brad ? " " Sure , " Braddock said , " and above twenty-four thousand the Spit-9 is a very good airplane  --  right ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Messerschmidt , the 110 , seems to be the ideal ship . " " Trouble is , " Braddock said , " right in there is where we fly . " A few minutes later the Tannoy announced an alert , for thenext day , and even I was strangely relieved at the announcement , but I noticed the new cheeks go pale , as my own must have whenI had first heard the fateful , hollow , metallic voice from Out There . After the alert Benny Chong , going off to his sack , left the clubdoor ajar , and right away Marrow called out , " Benny ! Hey ! Closep116that f  --  ing door . You think you 're coming back tomorrow or something ? " Chong poked his head in , said , " Up yours , Marrow , " and slammed the door . It got much worse . Braddock and Marrow fed each other horrorsto frighten the new men with . The way that gunner ( invented ) looked with the top of his head blown off by a cannon shell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip was untouched , he needed a shave , there was some cigarette paper stuck on the lip ; but his upper lip did n't exist , he was like the InvisibleMan from there upwards . About the gunner 's pal who had to take the rag in there and wipe the brains off the inside of the turret . Vivid details . I must say I went along with it , putting in my oar now and then , wanting , I think , to share some corner of Marrow'sfeeling that nothing nasty could happen to him on this earth ; little did I dream that our game of that evening would come home to roost on my sickened conscience weeks later , in July , when Kid Lynch had his immature but dazzling brain removed by part of a shell . By that time Marrow and Braddock apparently considered their malice warmed up , because they excused themselves and , with me and a couple of others tagging along to feel safe , wanderedover to the enlisted men 's Nissen huts and rooted around until they found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Willis Lamb , whose last name appealed to Marrow . I laughed that night . In those days I thought my pilot could do no wrong , and flakking-up was an honored institution , the dividing of a new man 's possessions against his likely death being a macabre burlesque of the conviction men held that disaster would strike not themselves but others . But memory has altered my point of view , and I wonder why I laughed at the sight of Marrow , with his eyes bugging out exactly as they did at the height of his stories about making love , an officer razzing an enlisted man , using death as a big joke to frighten a boy who had not yet faced it for the first time : Lamb on his hands and knees with Marrow leaning over him , Butcher Lamb who was to be Marrow 's own radio gunner , with his pathetic store of possessions scattered across the floor , his shaving set , his penknife , his flashlight ( " Say , that 's a pretty keen flashlight , where the hell did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a snapshot of his girl , a pale stick of a city girl in a cheap organdy dress that was like a whirl of spun sugar in an amusement-park eatery  --  Lamb 's upturned face , streaming sweat and agony , as Marrow triumphantly lifted the snapshot and said , " Well , look at Little Bo Peep ! Hot s  --  ! Lamb , when you 're shot dead I 'm going to go home and put the clamps to Bo Peep . Mmm  --  mmm . I bet she 's got a tight crotch . Look at this , fellas . You think this girl even knows she has a c  --  ? " I saw a momentary flash of hatred , of what might have passed for courage , on Lamb 's face , then its fading away into incredulity and despair as Marrow tore the snapshot into tiny pieces and threw them , like confetti , over Lamb 's head , and shouted amid the laughter all around , " Lamb of God ! You ready for the sacrifice ? " As we walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Group badly needed replacements , yet at dinner we 'd heard some of the new officers talk of having spent three months sitting around with nearly a thousand other trained pilots in a replacement center in Tallahassee , unable to get orders cut sending them to the E.T.O. , unable even to get up in aircraft long enough to make good on their flying pay . The new men had said , too , that they were positive they had n't had adequate training for combat . One of us brought these squawks up as we walked through tall woods toward our quarters , and Marrow stopped on the path , raised a fist and shook it toward Pike Rilling Hall , and through clenched teeth he uttered a cry of protest , frustration , and , I think now , yearning for the very authority he hated : " The bastards ! The mother-f  --  ing bastards ! " But when we got to our room Marrow said , " I 'm famished . Let 's steal us some eggs . " So we organized a foray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd learned , we could pull rank if we were caught , and while Braddock and I covered , Marrow and Stebbins broke a small pane in the mess-hall pantry door and let themselves in and put about a dozen real eggs and some butter in a helmet shell , and we took them back and scrambled four at a time in a pie tin on a hot plate , and while we were eating the second batch with spoons out of the common pan , Marrow , with his mouth full of hot eggs , said , " Oh Boman , letter for you . F'got to tell you . " " Where ? "  |p118He  pointed with his spoon at our desk . " Under some that stuff . " He turned to Braddock . " Good eggs , huh ? Better'n that f  --  ing powder . Wonder where they 'll send us tomorrow . " I dug down in the chaos on the desk and finally found the letter . It was typed . Addressed to Captain Boman at the base . A promotion and no first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Date four days past . Locus of origin Cambridge . " How long this been here ? " I asked . Buzz was chewing . He shrugged . " Day ' fore yesterday , " he said , " two , three days , I forget . Brought it over for you . " I tore it open . " Dear Captain , " it said . " It occured to me that neither you nor your friend has my address . It is Abbey Road , 24 . If you could ring up before six you could get me at the office , Cambridge 7342 . Ask for Section B. If that should be impossible try Cambridge 1476 after hours , and if you catch my landlady , Mrs. Coffin , in a good humour , she might fetch me downstairs to speak with you . Better tell her you 're a colonel to offset your being a Yank . She 's a bit of a lady , if you please . Place used to be digs for University Students . She had an Indian prince once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , or write to : Yrs. , Daphne Poole . " Before I felt really good I had three quick thoughts : Of course she knew my last name because that was all Marrow ever used ; and , Nice straight note , no fake excuses for being forward , and only one serious defect  --  that word " both " ; and , The rascal , hiding the letter on me for three days . The worst I could think of my pilot then was that he was a playful rascal . Braddock looked at my face and said , " Rich aunt die ? " On the hardstand , next morning , just before we boarded The Body , Clint Haverstraw said he had something to tell us all . He looked pale and earnest . Haverstraw was one flier who never had wanted to be a pilot.  |p119He  had elected navigation because he had a long head for numbers and patterns . The one thing he lacked was a sense of direction , and it appeared that navigation was unnatural work for him ; the worse he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting a fix with a sextant to keep in practice , he shot the sun , you had the feeling he left it thoroughly dead . He did most of his navigational figuring in his head , and though he seemed quiet , steady , efficient , he made dangerous mistakes , not of computation but of application ; formationflying saved us . He was rather submissive , eager to do a good job , though he had told me once that the idea of dropping bombs and killing people was deeply disturbing to him . Somehow he tickled Marrow , who seemed his opposite pole , and when others teased Clint , Marrow rose , often angrily , to his defense . Haverstraw was inflexible ; hated change of any kind . His enemy was not Nazi Germany but dirt , and he uttered the word " mud " as if there were some of it clinging to his palate about to trip by counterweightthe sluices of nausea . He would not have dreamed of going on a mission without carrying his good-luck charm  --  a British swagger stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't like it , " Haverstraw said . " Maybe I better not . " " P  --  or get off the pot , " Marrow said . " I 've been doing some figuring , " Haverstraw said . Then he said we 'd had a sixteen-per-cent loss on the Bremen mission , " but let 's say , to give ourselves the benefit of the doubt , that five per cent is more normal . " His calculations indicated , he said , that if you took an attrition rate of five per cent and applied it to the remainingships in the case of each successive mission , only two hundred seventy-seven out of each thousand planes would survive the standard tour , twenty-five missions . " Great timing , Clint , " I said . " Perfectly calculated to calm the troops just before battle . " But Marrow gently said , " Lay off him , Boman . " Buzz turned to Haverstraw . " Thanks , son , " he said . " I tell you something . I do n't give a s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm going to be one of ' em . " He stared us all down . He seemed a great man in those days . As we emplaned through the belly hatch , I happened to fol/low Haverstraw aboard . He paused at the mouth of the hatch , grasped his swagger stick as if it were a wand , touched lightly once with its tip each of the four sides of the hatch opening , then leaningand twisting his torso he kissed the skin of The Body just to the right of the doorway . After that he went up into the ship . They had given us St. Nazaire , another of the U-boat bases on the Bay of Biscay , and after Bremen we were nervous without yet knowing enough to understand why . Getting a mission started  --  that was when Marrow was at his best in those early days , for the wait before the take-off was the bad time , with so much idleness . He kept us all busy ; poured out a stream of chatter . " All right , Boman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all right ? . . . Watch the cowl flaps . " Then taxiing : " How are we on the right ? O.K. on the right ? " because if a wheel went off the hardstand into the mud the whole mission could be loused up . And he had similar jogs for all the others , keeping them on their toes . That was a rotten mission . There were low-flying clouds and spotty rain at the base . The  --  th Group , which was supposed to lead the strike , left the rendezvous ten minutes early , and our people had to fly with our throttles wide open twenty minutes to catch up . Five ships aborted . Over the continent we flew through a clearing , and below it was surprisingly hazeless so early , and we had reached base altitude , and looking down I could see a spread of France , flat , farm-textured , the faraway greens night-washed and yellowy under the morning sun . I saw a river that must have hated the sea , so much did it writhe in its reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like splotches of gray fungus , here and there on the carpet of Brittany . Views like this from the upper sky made me feel , even in danger , a kind of calm that came from considering myself an insect , or a unit of virus , for the activities of men  --  I imagined a Breton farmer playing a game with greasy cards at a tavern table , wine at his elbow , a fat brute with pink skin , bloated and selfish , oblivious to war , his bloodshot eyes flashing as he raised a winning card and slapped it down on the table and bellowed his triumph  --  were reduced to a microscopic scale , so that a whole city of such activities was no more than a stain on the earth , and a whole provinceof them was only a splash of cartographer 's green . It was corn/forting to think of men as being so small as to be invisible altogether , and therefore of the self , too , as utterly insignificant : a poor target . Yes , I had begun to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not , in the mission , the sensation of personaldanger I 'd experienced in more intimate conflict , such as boxing , which I 'd doggedly done in school . Flying at high altitude in extreme cold , unnaturally masked and strapped , depending on oxygen for survival , forced to communicate with my fellow creaturesmechanically ( I had to remember to press the button at one end of my half-moon wheel to make myself heard ) , above all seeingthe earth so far below as a mere pattern , a palette , gave me a feeling of severance , of being cut off , of being , as I was in an Englishpub , foreign . I think I 'd have been very surprised at the connection with humanity that would have been involved if The Body had been hit ; and I guess I would have reacted automatically with a further disconnection  --  by bailing out . I decided that the battle on the ground between missions was much more hazardous than combat itself , and up there I felt a kind of numbness , an alienation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was eight-tenths cloud , the enemy met us strongly . Brien exclaimed once on the interphone , with distinct accents of enjoyment , over the sight of one of our planes going down asmoke . I had an uneasy feeling about him , for he with his bad stomach seemed to regard combat as a kind of game . Flak was heavy ( " We could 've let our wheels down , " Handownsaid afterwards , " and taxied on the stuff " ) , and just before the bombing run there was an incoherent bit of jabbering on the interphone from Bragnani , but soon Farr broke in on CALL , saying , " Do n't pay no attention to him . " Those two . The crew of a Fort was supposed to be a big happy family , its members all willing to die for each other . Our crew was not that . We had individualists and cliques aboard our ship , and lots of bickering and hard feeling , even when we were in danger . Another thing . According to the poop you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hearts of gold , and all officers were supposed to be f  --  ups . I could n't see it that way . A sergeant waist gunner was the trouble-maker on our ship . Farr . For myp122money he single-handedly justified Marrow 's insane war on sergeants . Farr and Bragnani , the two waist gunners , were willing to die for each other , so they said . They claimed they had made a pact that if one had to go the other would , too , and I believe Bragnani would have followed Farr , all right , into the jaws of a lion ; the other way round , I 'm not so sure . At any rate , those two were surely allied against the rest of us ; I still remembered the practice flight when I 'd stumbled into the waist compartment with those flare pistols aimed down my throat . Farr was aggressive , always known as an irascible and difficult character , and consequently he was our lowest ranker , tech-three ; he 'd been demoted twice for brawling . Bragnani was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitating every moment Farr 's loud gripes . As Haverstraw 's enemy was dirt , Farr 's was the U.S. Army . " You 'd think they 'd give us some consideration . All this bull s  --  they put out ! They never had it so good . I 'll be f  --  ed if I 'll brown my nose for those bastards . " On the bombing run Fan called in a claim that he 'd shot down a German fighter . Regulations required that such claims should be reported at once to the pilot and be logged by the navigator . " I got one , " Farr shouted . " I got me a ME-log . " " You lying bastard , " Marrow said . " You never did . You made it up . " Farr and Marrow ranted on the interphone until I shut them up . The Group 's bombing was frightful . Visibility was poor , but it was good enough to see that most of our bombs fell short , into the sea . Going home the lead group turned north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take such a sharp turn that it went to pieces . We became scattered in a cloudy sky . The weather worsened , and Haverstraw had no idea where we were , and our ships landed separately at R.A.F. airdromes all over Southern England  --  at Warmwell , Potreath , Predannack , Exeter , Portland Bill  --  but Marrow took us right through a front and , flyinglow with a chart in his lap , got us home to our own base ; only one other ship made it . Upon landing we learned that our radio gunner , a timid , conscientious boy named Kowalski , had frozen his hands over the target . At altitude that day the temperature had been forty-fivep123degrees below zero , and in such cold as that , ninety seconds ' exposureis enough to freeze a man 's hands into solid blocks . The boy had been too afraid of a bawling out to report his condition ; he just whimpered , when we found him in the radio room , doubled over . His gun had jammed ; the electrically heated gloves we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or turn a turret crank , but they were too cumbersome for clearing a gun , and the poor sucker had tried to work too long with naked hands . Marrow was gentle with Kowalski , who was , as Marrow said , " one of my boys . " At the interrogation Farr pushed his claim of having shot down a German , but Marrow obdurately suppressed it . Fan was pale with anger , and unexpectedly he turned his rage , as soon as we were dismissed , on his pal Bragnani . Fan declared that before the bomb run  --  when we 'd heard that burbling on the interphone  --  Brag had panicked and had wanted to bail out . Fan said he 'd restrained him by force . Marrow promptly made a joke of it . " What you doing , Brag , testing your death pact with Jughead ? " Bragnani was absolutely enslaved to Fan from that time onward . We were all depressed after that mission . Gross-Error Brindt was so hacked about the bad bombing that he began to say that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were losing the war . Marrow valiantly teased us , to keep us game . But when Marrow learned that Kowalski had serious frostbite and would have to be grounded indefinitely , Marrow himself became morose . " The stuff those sergeants get away with , " he said . After supper a stand-down was announced for the following day , and I called Daphne , and , though she did not sound particularlyexcited to hear my voice , she agreed to meet me at noon , at the Bull . " Will your friend come , too , Captain ? " " Marrow ? He 's all tied up tomorrow . By the way , I 'm only a lieutenant . Leftenant to you . " " Could n't matter less , " she said. 124 The next day was the second of May , and the sun arrived in a brand-new sky as cheerful and strident as a milkman . I waited for Marrow to leave the hutment before I got slicked up , and afterwards I went to the PX and drew hospitality rations  --  one of the parcels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among our English cousins the ill-will arising from gratitude . I hopped a liberty bus at ten , and driving across the base in the gloriousmorning we passed first a rectangular place where workmen were laying down four tennis courts , and then the five plowed acres of the station 's agricultural project , the dream and stubborn fixationof a patriotic major from Ohio in Group Headquarters who wanted us all to eat good American golden-bantam corn in summertime , if it would only grow in this lousy rainy swamp of a country . I felt completely engulfed by the life of the Group , and I was sharply struck by the intermittency of my war : high hell at noon , a warm familiar sack at midnight ; briefing at three in the morning , tennis-anyone at three in the afternoon . One day the sight of poor Kowalski 's dead-looking hands ; the next the sight of Daphne 's delicate fingers lighting a cigarette . Braddock had gone on one raid in his dress uniform under a flying suit so he would n't be late for a date in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . I felt , as a shudder , my luck that I was not a foot soldier forced to sleep on the ground night after night , never able to get clean , my Daphne an impossible fantasy ; my luck that at this moment I could deny with all my heart the existence of danger . I had only one idea : to go to bed with a girl I liked . There she was , before I knew it , in the dusky lobby , in a printed cotton dress with a sweater over her arm . " How come you got the afternoon off ? " I asked . " My dear auntie "  --  a very broad a  --  " in Bury St. Edmunds isill . " I laughed with her , and a question went lickety-split through my mind : If she 'd lie for me , would she lie to me ? Then I held the parcel out to her . " Oooh ! " she said . " Snacks ? " I nodded.  | " Then we must picnic . " Her delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the river . " " You ought to save that junk , " I said . " We can eat somewhere fancy . I 'm loaded . " I put a hand in my pants pocket and jingled the bulky half-crowns and florins and pennies there . I guess I was playing the rich American to the hilt , and I got my come-uppance . " Why save ? " she said . " To feast alone ? " She flooded me with a sense of the importance of that single day  --  a feeling I was to get often from Daphne . Sometimes she would speak freely of the past , but she seemed to prefer the present . Talk of the future made her secretive , taciturn , gloomy . We went on foot through a soft noontime across Christ 's Piece and Midsummer Common to a raised footpath along the Cam , opposite a row of boathouses , and soon we were in a countrysideof lanes , coming down to the river , that Constable might have painted , where firethorn and vibumums had spread out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade was bluish close at hand . Daphne was evidently elated at the way I stared at her . I could think of nothing except touching her , and though her body walked sedately on the riverside path , her mind moved like the feet of a child playing hopscotch . I could n't follow what she was saying ; she did n't seem to care . We came to a meadow full of daisies , and I spread my tunic for Daphne , and we opened a can of I forget what and tasted it . " Should have brought some beer , " I said . We could n't eat . For some crazy reason I talked about Janet , my so-called fiancee . " She 's on the chubby side , " I said , " and she 's got a very long tongue , she can touch the end of her nose with her tongue . Also , double-jointed thumbs . " I told Daphne that Janet had been the most  --  what should I say ?  --  libidinous girl , judging by appearances , in Donkentown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , even after I found out that appearances could be deceptive , and if there had n't been a war I might have gone ahead and married her . " Did you love her ? " Daphne asked . " With an adolescent tomcat love , " I said . Janet and I were at loggerheads from the start , though , because I wanted her to be Ingrid Bergman , and she wanted to be Virginia Woolf , and we were both stuck with her being Janet Spenser . She was a tease . She 'd lead you on , and then , whammo ! Put it on the basis thatp126That Was Sacred To Marriage . I kept coming back for more and never could figure out why we argued so bitterly  --  whether Vivien Leigh made a good Scarlett O'Hara , and whether a third term for F. D. R. was a good idea , and whether the British pavilion at the New York World 's Fair was stuffy . I mean , we really fought . I recalledone time with her at a Robin Hood Dell concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other all through one of those Stokowski transcriptions of Bach ; around us the shushes were louder than the music . " I 'm finished with her , " I said . " When I got over here she wrote me two letters in two weeks , and the second accused me of being unfaithful to her  --  when , hell 's bells , I had n't had a chance to figure out the best way to walk through the mud from our hutmentto the officers ' mess  --  and then she quit writing . Have n't heard another word . You know what I think ? I think she 's come as close as she can to being unfaithful to me . I was sore for a while , but to hell with her . " The marvelous warm sun made me drowsy . " You look ninety years old , " Daphne said . " Here . Put your head here . " She patted her lap . I gladly took her suggestion , and I slept like a baby for two solid hours . I awakened grumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience to such a severe test on our first outing  --  bored her with Janet and then folded on her . She was tranquil ; she waited out my bad humor . " Big deal for you today , " I said . " Bet you wish you were back in Section B. " But she was n't going to indulgemy self-pity , and she silently stood up and brushed off her dress , and then , with the first tiny pain in my chest in her honor , I recalled the feel of her thigh under my cheek . " Where 's the fire ? " I said . When we started back , however , I felt refreshed . We struck out across country through tawny green fields and into a shadowy woodland , along a tiny path , and , with a last stab of my bad mood , I thought : How come Daphne knows about this path ? How many guys has she led along it ? So quickly , so subtly had she taken possessionof me by making me feel possessive of her . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of renewal out of the damp earth , I remembered a vivid mood I hadp127had just before I had fallen asleep with my cheek on Daphne 's leg , the back of my head pressing against her ungirdled abdomen  --  a mood of restlessness and dissatisfaction with myself , for I had thought of a few of the many things I 'd left unfinished back in Donkentown , of the books I 'd planned to read some day , the artifactsI 'd intended to make . Next time . There 'd never be a next time . If I lived , I 'd be older , different . " We must come back to our meadow some time , " I said . " Love to , " Daphne said . " It 's wizard out here , is n't it ? " " I 'll bring a couple beers next time . " But I knew we 'd probablynever return , and if we did , we 'd be different : we would n't be total strangers , anyway , trying by random words and apparently casual touch to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Arms on the dull fare of English austerity : whatever it was , it was breaded and cooked as if cooking were a type of punishment . And we asked about each other in a rather challenging way , almost saying : What 's the matter with you ? There was something here about being foreign to each other , our ideas at variance and our goals for life , though unexplored , probably far apart . But on my side there seemed to be more : I wanted to know why Daphne had preferred me to Marrow , yet I could not ask , and I wondered whether , now that she knew me , she really did , or would , and I had begun to doubt my intention of taking her to bed . Of all this I said not a word . I see now that perhapswe were both steeling ourselves to unnatural and immodest animal haste , for I suppose we both could see that no matter how strong my doubts , I would surely try to go to bed with her before the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life as an aviator gave me the right to do that . This certainty produced a curious perversity in me . I did not try to be as attractive as possible ; to the contrary , I ran myself down . I told her I 'd been a boxer at Penn , had become Eastern intercollegiaterunner-up in the **30;814;TOOLONG class . I told her I 'd hated it ; I 'd stayed with it , I guessed , in order to prove something to Janet and to myself about a man of my small stature  --  although I 'd always done all I could to avoid being a typicalcocky shorty . I 'd never hit anyone hard enough to knock him out , never really roughed it up , partly , I suppose , because I 'd usedp128to play the piano , and I was concerned about what my mother had always called my " piano hands , " and I was also worried about my ugly nose , whose shape I wanted no worse than it already was , but also because I did n't enjoy hurting people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good boxer one really had to enjoy dealing out pain . I stressed to her that I had always been a runner-up ; a co-pilot . Daphne asked me what had been my field of interest in college . I kept right on depreciating myself ; said my sole interest had been dean's-list marks , which I 'd achieved by writing long essays in such a scrawly , semi-legible hand that the instructors had thought there must be something hidden in that underbrush . " History . I was hot for everything remote . Want to hear an example of my examination prose style ? The Merovingian dynasty , ruling iron-fisted over the Franks , helped Actius stem the barbarian wave at the battle of Mauriac , on the Catalaunian fields , the Frankish foedereti under Meroveus gnashing in the forefront of the fray . ' " " Gracious , " Daphne said . " That 's me , " I said . I even went to the trouble of dragging Marrow into the conversation . " Funny guy , " I said . " He talks about new pilots being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Daphne , I was discovering , was tactful in a painfully feminineway : She took a position only after finding out exactly what yours was . Her answers often took the form of questions . " Is he a good flier ? " she asked . " The best , " I sourly said , and dropped the subject , lest it becomeinteresting . After dinner she asked me , with a direct look in my eyes , if I wanted to go with her to her room . The answer to the question was obvious , but I had to say , " How does your landlady feel about your having visitors ? " I could n't even say what I meant but had to use a sardonic euphemism : visitors . " Mrs. Coffin ? As I told you in my note , " Daphne said , playingupon my churlishness with an absolute innocence of expressionand tone , " she takes a dim view of Yanks . " " You make the traffic sound pretty heavy , " I said.  | " Not really , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sadness in her eyes as she spoke . Pitt ? What a heel I felt ! I was gratuitously giving a hard time to this girl whom I barely knew , almost calling her names  --  for what reason ? Maybe to justify my having gone to the PX to buy those condoms before I had even learned where she lived . The first thing Daphne did when we reached her room  --  Mrs. Coffin may have heard my heavy shoes on the stairs , but she did n't make herself known  --  was to close the door and shoot the bolt . She sat down with the oddest expression before a mirror on a tiny single-drawered dressing table she had , for her face seemed to say , " Look at me ! Did you ever see such a clever girl ? " She seemed uncommonly pleased with herself . Then that expression passed , and she began brushing her hair , and sitting on the edge of the bed I was struck again by her obviousliking of herself . It was almost as if she were sneaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair . The packet of hospitality rations was on the edge of her table , and she began taking the things out , one by one , and when she came to a bottle of hard candies she behaved like a child . She jumped up and brought it to me and asked me to open it , and while I made a show of being strong , she jiggled impatiently in front of me . She popped a sourball in her mouth , and , speaking thickly , asked me if I wanted her to tell me a secret . She was like a kitten . She sat on the opposite side of the bed from me , pulled her legs up , threw her shoes on the floor . I said , sure , I 'd like to know all about her . This secret was an embarrassing tale , told with the too-big candy in her mouth , about Major Silg , who had showed his appreciation for her at an earlier dance on the base in a distinctlyunorthodox way . " You 're the only person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swear you wo n't repeat it to anyone . " I solemnly swore , and a week later I heard the same story from Stebbins at the bar ofp130the officers ' club . The bottom almost fell out of my stomach when I heard Steb begin to describe Silg 's pathetic technique of attack ; then I realized that Stebbins might have had the account from Pitt , and I felt better . I asked Daphne about Pitt , and it was obvious that she had overestimated him . But she said , perhaps as a comfort to me , " he was n't really right for me . " During this time I was torn , for Daphne 's face , as she talked , was suffused with a pinkish warmth , and I was drawn toward it with a painful yearning ; but at the same time I was more and more impressed with her air of child-like innocence , and I had a queer feeling that I must not take advantage of her . It was a foregone conclusion that my desire , the deep , lonely hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphover my scruples , which were dissolving . In the back of my mind , no doubt , as a goad , was the thought of what Marrow would be doing while I sat there talking . Somehow , at any rate , I decided to compromise , to experimentto see if I could kiss her a bit and then opt what to do . I thought I was leaving myself a free choice ! As my desire grew stronger and I came closer and closer to touching her , I began to feel a need to be attractive and I began to experience powerful and painfully sweet emotions , akin to those of my adolescent years , and suddenly I was talking about those years . " In the eighth grade I was a good boy , I was Class Monitor , and that meant I had an important job  --  clapping the erasers at the end of the day . " The clouds of fragrant dust , the hoarfrost on my sweater . I told Daphne about Miss Davis , who wore short sleeves and had fascinating ambushes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of a Czech refugee , and I recalled my brilliant tenor swipe , " in the mo-o-o-orning , " in Do Ye Ken John Peel ? I took great interest in Marion Swienkoski , a tall girl at the next desk , who was said to be fast . No luck ; I was unable to bring myself to speak to her . I described basketball knee pads to Daphne , and I told her how embarrassed I had been about the shape of my hands , which were stubby ; I used to try to spread my fingers on my own thigh in a sophisticated , relaxed manner . The steel legs of my desk in class were like those of an old-fashioned Singer Sewing Machine ; I wished for a treadle.  |p131Civitas  , civitatis , civitate , civitatem , civitate . Was that right ? I remembered , walking home , Mr. Watkins ' cherry tree completely covered with cheesecloth to keep the birds out . The workbench in my room was cluttered with strips of cardboard , ready to be assembledinto a model , let 's say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads from the ceiling were the Wrights ' primitive kite , the Spirit of St. Louis , the Winnie Mae , Bellanca 's Columbia , a Gee Bee Sport Racer ... . I shifted my weight , to quite a clanking and squeaking of the brass-framed bed , and I put my cheek against hers . She did not draw away ; to the contrary , she moved as if slowly melting . This soft , yielding acquiescence , on top of her many other signs of acceptanceof me , stirred an overpowering flood of feeling in me , and I took her in my arms. 71I was eased yet unfulfilled . Never in my young life had I experienced anything like what this extraordinary girl had given me , yet I was far more aware of what she had withheld . There had been no resistance , no difficulties . What I had seen of her delight in being admired , her pleasure at being hungrily watched by many men at the dance , had had its counterpart in something that had made her , here in her yellow-walled room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated to the easy surrender of very much . This was not a cheaply used girl . Yet instead of feeling like a lion , arrogant , boastful , and exultant , I felt , instead , somehow embarrassedand locked out . She had sweetly given in , but she had yielded only her shell , not her self , for I sensed that she still wanted to be fought for and truly conquered , and that she still awaited her defeat at my wooing hands in joyful agitation . This had not been what she wanted . It had not been what I wanted , either . I had great obstacles to overcome before I would have accessto the enormous treasures I now knew were deeply secreted in Daphne . Her underclothing was shabby and frequently mended . Asp132we dressed I handled some of it , passing it to her , and she gave me the look of the poor , called pride , which is hard to distinguish from resentment . Yet she spoke with a generous voice . " Leftenant Boman , " she said , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed , " do n't you think it 's time you told me your first name ? " " Charles , " I said . " Some people call me Bo . " " Bo , " she said , cocking her head to one side as if listening with a thoughtful ear . " Yes , I like that . Bo . " Then she took me in her arms and pulled me to her . " My dear Bo , " she feelingly said . I was as gentle as I could be . I saw that I had much work to do , to fathom the surely marvelous depths of Daphne . We were checking over the plane after a practice flight , and Marrow told Red Black that he might pass as a mechanic but that he looked like a chimneysweep  --  could n't he neaten up ? His whole ground crew , Buzz said , was filthy . Black then had a temper tantrum , shouting at Marrow that the mechanics had been issued exactly two suits of coveralls apiece , and that the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ; he strode off , quite audibly calling Captain Marrow a f  --  ing Captain Bligh . Marrow said to me , " This is on those bastardly desk pilots up at Wing . " Wing had long since become our favorite target for gripes . " Come on , Boman , let 's get our bikes and go on up there to Wing right now and blast ' em about this . " Sergeants in clean clothes were bad enough . We rode out through the Wing gate to Pike Rifling Hall . Wing Headquarters was in a placid Georgian house set in a formal park designed ( Lynch told me much later ) by Andre Lenotre . From wide parterres the vistas extended down avenues cut through woodlands of towering beeches , and at the end of the principal one , running toward the eastward , there was a Temple of Love sheltering a marble figure of Aphrodite . " Great climate top233be bare-ass in all year round . " In one of the reception rooms of the house , where Marrow and I were kept waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print of the house , and out the window we saw that certain trees in the print were still living  --  notably one linden , which , after two hundred years , had become a noble giant overvaulting one whole end of the house . Lynch observed , when I later spoke to him about the great tree , that the house was now occupied by men whose country was younger than the tree . Marrow , of course , had asked to see the General , and it goes without saying that we saw , instead , his aide , a Major Hunert , who was notorious for riding to hunt foxes in a pink coat with a local pack . He led us through the Wing Operations Room  --  the Bubu Factory , as it was known to us fliers  --  a high-windowed parlorwith a huge celotex sheeting over one wall , on which there was a vast 1:500,000 situation map of most of Europe , under talc , splotched with red measles representing flak areas , decorated with toy airplanes showing where the Hun fighters were based , webbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and splasher beacons , and dew-dropped with bright-headed pushpins . There were blackboards and desks with WACs at them , and Marrow 's eyes rolled in lightning flirtations . Major Hunert sat us down , and he was polite to us , in the way a man of the world is polite to waiters , and he got rid of us quickly , and nothing ever happened about the laundry . But somethinghappened in Marrow . On our way back to the base , as we rode near the Temple of Love , Marrow stopped , dismounted , examined the alley of enormousbeeches that lined the vista , and , after a brief calculation , said , " You know , Boman , I bet a Fort could fly up this split in the woods . You could fly lower than the treetops  --  straight at those windows up there . Bet you something else , too . If that Major Hunert was standing in the window , he 'd really p  --  in his pants . "  |p134We  met after Daphne 's office hours in the lobby of the Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning -- itwas Wednesday , the fifth of May  --  had broken cold and disagreeable . A huge truckload of mail had arrived at the base ; we had been starved for mail for three weeks , and it turned out that this whole shipment was a month old and had been dispatchedby mistake to the Twelfth Air Force in North Africa . Situation normal : all f  --  ed up . No letter from Janet . I was actuallyglad . I had taken off for Cambridge on the afternoon liberty bus , carrying with me some candy bars I had saved from a scrubbingand a mission we 'd had in preceding days . I handed Daphne the candy , and she kissed me on the cheek , to thank me , and said , " How you Yanks must eat ! " I said , " No , listen ! We have a guy named Prien in our ship , our tail gunner , he gets gas on his stomach , you ought to hear him bitch about the food they sling us . " Monotony . Powdered eggs . Grease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law of gravity . Beans and cabbage just before an evening alert  --  a bellyache and morale all shot . I told her Prier 's whole song and dance . " I want milk . I need milk . " Filthy mess halls . KPs shovingthe food off spatulas with dirty thumbs , black fingernails . What a way to start off a date with a girl ! " You poor dear , " Daphne said , as if Prien 's complaints had been my own , seeming to know exactly what had made me talk that way , seeming to take such talk for granted . " I 'm going to fix you a high tea in my room , but we 'll have to get some buns . Do you have some of that famous money ? " " Cash is my middle name , " I said . We went shopping . She had an umbrella . She scolded me for not wearing a raincoat . The first thing she did in her room , again , was to lock the door . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mrs. Thingumbobcheck up on you ? " " No , " she said , and she shrugged . " I guess I just like secrets . "  |p135Her  room was our secret place ; the rain tapped at the window . Everything was different from the last time . We wanted to please each other , and I felt happy , and I wanted Daphne to know that . She brewed some tea that would have flown a Fort , and she put out some cakes , and we talked about our childhoods . She had had diphtheria , she told me , when she was four or five . She remembered that she was supposed to be taken to the hospital , her father had been summoned from his office to carry her there , but he was delayed , and he did n't come and did n't come . He was a civil servant of some minor kind , she said , a versatileman , humorous , kindly , and well read , but not born or educateda gentleman ; he 'd come of working-class people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ceiling to his career . This had not , however , by Daphne 's account , embittered him , but had turned him to a life of the mind , and to his children . Anyway , the day she fell sick , it got later and later , and her mother was upset , and finally her father came  --  and why was he late ? Becausehe had been to Regent Street , to a shop much above his budget , and he had bought her a nightgown , and a bed jacket , and a comb , for her visit away from home . " He sounds like a kind man , " I said . She told me he was dead . She said she remembered being led by his hand to art galleries ; she spoke of her vivid response , when she was about thirteen , to Bouchers and Fragonards in the Wallace Collection , and she spoke of the " burning Turner sunsets " that her father loved in the Tate . " I 'd like to see those , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take you one day , " she said , as if an understanding had been reached between us that we would have a great deal of time together . I tried to tell her about the sunrise we 'd seen flying out on the Antwerp raid the day before  --  a clear , lemon-yellow sky ahead , and behind us the dim blue of the part of the heavens still in the earth 's shadow , and far below us an upside-down sky  --  a vast sheet of cirrocumulus with its tidy mackerel pattern seen from above . " I like to look at the sea , " she said , and she told me about a childhood trip to the beaches of Devon . " I love the sky , " I said . " I remember a mackerel sky , when I was maybe twelve , as if it were yesterday , out of my window inp136Donkentown . " I remembered it so vividly ! There was a foretaste of dry days  --  a few sweeping mare 's tails off to the northwest . They made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge horses , and I began to daydream , looking out the window , about chariot races , and I was a driver , and I hooked the wheel of the coppersheathedchariot of the Hun villain , on a skidding turn , and his wheel came off ten feet before the torches of the finish line , and I looked up at the Emperor , and the crowd was roaring , and overhead  --  Isaw it so clearly in my memory !  --  overhead , above the Circus Maximus , there was a mackerel sky , tinged with the first pink undertouches of the end of the day . " Did you ever have cambric tea ? " Daphne asked me . " No , what 's that ? " " It 's really only hot milk and water and sugar with the least suggestion of tea . . . . " Daphne pictured to me a tiny summerhousein a tiny garden , and something about her brother , who was meticulous , had a model railway outdoors , the L.M.S. , a perfect replica .. . . But I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of what I could tell her next to impress her with my sensitivity , my kindness , my warmth , the ideality of my parents , my high regard for everything fine . Daphne was trying to impress me in the same way , I guess , and probably she was not really listening to me , either . But strangely enough , each of us , so concerned with our own excellent qualities , came through that conversation to appreciate each other more than before , even though we took in little of what was said . This feeling of self-love , the first step toward the love of someoneelse , was a source of inner strength for me , and I wanted to let Daphne know that ever since I had been in this room with her the last time , I had felt stronger , more sufficient to my tasks . I told her that , thanks to having been with her , I 'd been , ever since , a friend to all mankind . I told her we 'd lost our radioman , Kowalski , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him in sick quarters , and I 'd cheered him up a lot . Now , through my exultation in my own goodness , I was payinga tribute to Daphne , so what I was saying was partly about her , and she therefore had begun to listen attentively to me , with herp137head a little on one side and her eyes looking at me with profound understanding and approval . I was quite off-hand about a raid we 'd flown to Antwerp the day before . It was a funny war , one joke after another . Our new radioman , Lamb , on his first mission , had begun by talking volublyover the interphone , but later we had n't heard a word from him , and he was supposed to be firing a gun on a sliding bracket mount in a slot back of the top turret , so Handown had gone back in the radio room and had found the guy sound asleep . Thought he 'd passed out but he was just taking a nap ! I laughed , and Daphne laughed , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing , " 1 said ; " flies by intuition . " An FW-190 had dive-bombed us , air to air , from about four thousand feet above us , and Buzz had waited to the very last moment , and then . . . " I 'll bring him along the next time I come to see you . " I was so dazzled with myself that I 'd lost my mind . " All right , " she said . The hours fled from our happiness , and the time came to leave . " I do n't know , " I said , " you 've sort of given me a whole new slant on things . " I kissed her once , and that was all . On the liberty bus going back to the base , I looked at the faces of our fliers , and I thought , What decent men ! How fortunateI am to be one of them ! On Saturday , May eighth , I called Daphne and arranged to meet her the next day for lunch in the town of Motford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could take a bus there . I asked Marrow later if he wanted to go with me . " Hey , neat , " he said , like a kid . " We can ride bikes . " And that was what we did , though it was a sad , drizzling day.  |p138Part  of the time we rode side by side . Willows lined the highway for a stretch . Buzz began talking about after the war . According to Haverstraw 's Law of Probabilities , there was n't going to be much chance of surviving the war for any of us , but Buzz , I guess , believed that the law could n't be proven without some exceptions , among which he planned to be one of the most prominent . He said , " Jesus , I got a stack of back pay just rotting . It 's rotting till it stinks . " It hurt his feelings to think he 'd have to wait until after the war to spend it . A few minutes later he said , " You know something ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll populatea whole new heavy-bombardment group for ' em . " He pumped some more and said , " No , I guess I want to be a padre after the war . Those f  --  ing chaplains lead a nice life  --  not too much work , just listening to a bunch of guys spilling their guts about their troubles , same as a bartender , you know ? Only a padre can sit down while he listens and a bartender ca n't . And then he picks out some hymns and thinks up a sermon and maybe cleans up five bucks marrying somebody : We arc gathered together , brethrenand sistern , to unite this man and this woman in holy matrimony . . . . Will the fellows from the glue factory please take the back pews , near the windows ? . . . ' Jesus Christ , Boman , now , you know , that 's a good life . That 's for me . " We met Daphne in time for lunch , or maybe it was tiffin , at the Old Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Marrow over breaded veal and brussels sprouts and boiled potatoes . It seemed to me that Daphne was one of those women who keep a close eye on themselves , who think hard about why they do things , and so have a powerful apparatus for understanding other people 's actions and motives . Daphne appeared to have Marrow absolutely taped . It was as if his inner mind and feelings were her own . She gave a striking impression of warmth and sympathy toward him , because of this capacity of hers . She knew , right off the bat , that the only proper subject of conversation with William Siddlecoff Marrow was William SiddlecoffMarrow . He laid it on with a trowel . She got Marrow going on the thrill of flying . " Why , " he said , " it 's like nothing can stop you . Sometimes I just want to yell up there . You see , " he said , approaching a serious face close to Daph/ne 's , " that whole machine is part of you . You 're the most powerful creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny bit , in deference to the might of which Buzz spoke . This was undoubtedly what gratified him the most . " What about death ? " she asked in a small voice . " Phooey ! " Marrow scornfully said . " Do you know the biggest discipline problem among pilots ?  --  I mean pilots that are men . It 's they ca n't resist thumbing their noses at death . They take chances that would turn your hair white . . . . " And Buzz showed that he was angry with death . He spoke of death as " that bastard in the sky " and " that God-damn sergeant . " " You know what I 'd like to do ? " he ferociously said at one point . " I 'd like to kill death . " He banged the table , and the ladle jumped in the soup tureen . Marrow was twenty-six  --  a strange age at which to have given death so very much thought . When we had finished the main course Daphne said to Marrow , " Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buzz said . " Hell , I 've flown thirty-one hundred hours and never cracked up a plane . " " No , " Daphne said . " Start at the beginning . " " Oh , Christ ! " Buzz said . But Daphne looked at him with that air of close concentration of hers . Marrow lit a cigar . " O.K. , I 'm twenty-six years old , " he said . " I was born inHoland , Nebraska , and was raised up there . It 's in the corn countrysixty-four miles from Omaha and fifty-six from Columbus , between the Elkhorn , Loup , and Platte Rivers . Population nine hundred and three . They have sidewalks but nobody uses ' em . " Right away I 'll say my old man was my hero . He did a littlep140of everything and not much of anything  --  real estate , and a bit of insurance such as there is in a hick town like Holand , and he had the Chevvy agency for the county for a while . He wanted me to have all the opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man 's man . He 's dead now . Sometimes I suspect maybe he was a blowhard , but I loved the old son of a bitch . " I 'll never forget the first night I stayed out all night . Me and some other guys took some girls over to Columbus , and you know , one thing led to another , nothing much in a crowd like that , only all of a sudden the sun was coming up . It was the Fourth of July on a Saturday  --  or had been when we started out . I got home at nine thirty Sunday morning , and I knew the old man was going to get after me with the hammer and tongs . I had a story made up , but I did n't bank on it to help me much . When I went in the house I did n't see anyone , so I went in the dining room , and there was the old man , eating breakfast . Why , son , ' he said . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so early Sunday morning ? Sit down , ' he said , have some breakfast . ' So I did . I thought I 'd split a gut from not laughing . " I went two years to Creighton University in Omaha . I was going to take premedical . I wanted to be an obstetrician . I do n't know , women just naturally fascinate me , and "  --  Buzz turned an ego-maniacal grin on Daphne  --  " and vice versa . And sister , I mean vice . " The first woman I ever went to bed with , I was thirteen years old , and she was so old she had a daughter ten . I do n't know what pleasure she got out of having my little body on top of her , I swear I do n't . But she made me do it . Afterwards she was ashamed and made me promise not to tell anyone . Well , by the time I got to be a sophomore at Creighton , her daughter was seventeenand I was going on for twenty . That girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vacation time , I noticed whenever I used to call on the daughter , her mama would go right upstairs and leave us alone . One night I said to Dottie , " Let 's go to the movies over at Columbus . ' Columbus was an hour 's drive , and our town was strict  --  you know ?  --  so when a fellow wanted to take a girl to Columbus , the girl needed notice , she had to ask permission , and you always had to double-date . So Dottie said she 'd have to ask Mama , and I said , It 'll be all right , ' and she said , Why , Bill '  --  I wasp141called Bill in those days  --  I could n't go all the way to Columbus alone with you , without I even asked Mama . ' So she went over to the stairs and shouted , Mama ! ' " Yes , dear . ' " Can I go to the movies in Columbus tonight ? ' " Who with , dear ? ' " Bill Marrow . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . You go right ahead now with Billy . ' " We drove over to Columbus and I took her to the movies , and one way and another I kept her out real late . I went to see her the very next night , and Mama raised no objection to me taking her to Omaha . So that second night Dottie said to me , You know , Bill , ' she said , I do n't get this . Mama wo n't let me go out with anyone else alone , and two nights in a row ! And with everyone else she gives me a definite time to be home , and when I come in , she asks me : what did I do ? and was I a good girl ? But last night she did n't even call me in her room , and when I went in there she just rolled over and made out she was half asleep , she only groaned like . I do n't get the picture . ' " So I said , Maybe she just trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a hot one . ' " And I said , Yeah , it is . ' " Junior year I transferred to Georgetown , in Washington , D.C. Christ 's sake , I just had to break away and get to the Easternseaboard . I arrived in Washington with a portable radio and a brand-new set of golf clubs ; I must 've thought I was joining a God-damn country club . I soon found out . " My roommate was Maxwell Gorse Ervin . We called him Plankton , he was so little , he was littler than you are , Boman . He was the **25;846;TOOLONG wrestler on the team , and now he 's wrestling the controls of one of those huge PBYs , those flyingbarges they have in the Navy , you know ? He 's a lot smaller than you are , Boman , and those planes , Jesus , they 're huge . I have to laugh when I think of him flying a PBY . Almost as silly as you flying a Fort , Boman . " The first time I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than going to bed with Dottie 's mama  --  or anyone else . It was really keen . It was one day Plank and me went out to look aroundp141at Anacostia , and while we were looking the planes over we asked if we could hop a ride . And one of the fellows said , Sure . ' It was an old Navy 02U he took us up in . We just flew around Anacostia . God 's teeth , I could n't wait to get another ride . " Then , vacation time , Plank said to me , Thug , ' he said , that 's what he called me for a while , he said , The hell with the train , let 's go over to Bolling Field and catch a lift in a plane . ' So I said I was game , and we did , and after that we both wanted to be fliers . " I lasted out that one year , then I flunked out . That place wore me to the bone . End of that year I weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I weigh a hundred eightysix . So you can see . At the present time , by the way , I wear size nine shoes and a size seven and a half hat . Did you ever hear of such small feet going with such a big head ? It 's the girls that gave me a swelled head . " I wasted two years working in a grain dealer 's office in Omaha . I never did anything except what they told me to do , not a God-damn thing more . I was like a God-damn sergeant . All I could think about was learning how to fly or else getting in there with some girl . But I did n't do anything about the flying  --  and the other : hell , those girls were so easy it turned your stomach . " Then I got this letter from Plank , he was in Worcester , Mass. , and he said he was taking flying lessons , so I packed a suitcaseand went out there and got a job , and me and Plank learned at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Lack . The reason I 'm such a good flier , he was drunk all the time , and you could say I was obliged to solo the first time I ever went up . " Seriously , though , I was a natural . My reflexes are fast . ' When a doc hits under my kneecap with that little rubber hammerto test my reflexes , that doc has got to be a well co-ordinated r. , an to duck my foot , I kick like a God-damn bullfrog  --  know what I mean ? " I could n't afford a plane , so I just bummed rides whenever I could . I built up pretty good hours that way . Then I finally got a job testing for Mildress  --  I lied like a Eyetalian boor about how many hours I 'd had , and they liked the way I handled a plane , so they put me to work . They 'd broke a test pilot 's neck two weeksp143before , so it was in their minds that they wanted me more than I wanted them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , they made these stodgy little trainers  --  remember , Boman ? Twelve flat , to get up , give it a slow roll , a snap left , a snap right , and a dive . Those dives were my meat ! I used to give the hoi polloi a thrill , believe me . " Then the time came when you could be blind as a mole in the ground and still see there was going to be a war , so I got myselflined up to pretend I had to learn to fly , and from Spanner Field on it was one long rat race . You know that , Boman . " That 's about it , except I failed to mention the women in my life , only do n't think I forgot ' em . I never forget ' em for a minute . I 'll never forget one , I called her the Filly from Philly , she came to deliver an album of records , wanted to make me a present of this album  --  Dwight Fiske ; remember Dwight Fiske , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl Who Came to Dinner . " I do n't know my secret , me and my ugly pan , unless maybe if you treat a hoor like a lady she 'll do anything for you , and you treat a lady like a hoor she 'll either do anything for you or haul off and bop you one , which is a time-saver in the long run . " No , seriously , I 'm just nice to ' em . I make an effort . I remember when I was working at Mildress , I used to make a point of diving right down over the houses of each one of my best girls daily . To let them know I was thinking about ' cm . " Some people say I talk too much . That gets me real sore , because I 'm just making an effort . Once a girl in Denver , she 'd heard I was a blowhard and she came up and she said , Are you this famous Guff Marrow ? ' I did n't talk for two days . Man , that struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buzz until I was at Spanner Air Base , getting my so-called flight instruction when I was already a hell of a flier . In my bunch of cadets , we had two Smiths , two Days , and two Turners , and no less than ten guys named Bill , which was always getting everybody screwed up on exactly who they meant , so they just doled out a whole new bunch of names . They looked at me and said I was going to be Buzz . So I 'm Buzz . " Let 's see , what else ? " Oh : cars . I 've had a slew of cars . The only thing that used top144pass me out home was the Streamliner . I clocked it at a hundred and five near Grand Isle , once . My last car , you know , I left it in the parking lot at Bennett the day we flew over here . The key was in it and everything . I just drove up and got out and went on board the plane . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty bucks . Who knows , John O. Public may be honest after all , the damn thing may even be there when I get back . But if it 's not , hell , I 'll just figure I lost it in a crap game . I 've lost more'n that at one sitting . But God damn it , I am sore about leaving my electric razor in the car . It was Haverstraw 's fault , the son of a bitch . I told him to put it in the back , in my suitcase . He just left it loose . I 'd a lot sooner lose my car than that razor . I have a very tough beard . Have to shave at least twice a day to be presentable . " And , let 's see . ' Wherever I go , I always carry two fifty-dollar bills . I call it my mad money . Case I get in any kind of trouble . " Well , you asked for the story of my life . " Buzz folded his arms on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Daphne . He looked pleased with himself . " But what about the war ? " she said , using again the very small voice of someone intimidated by such masculine vitality as his . " Never had it so good , " he snapped out . " What do you mean ? " she asked . " I like to fly , " he said . " I like the work were doing . " " Work ? " " Listen , " he said , with flashing eyes , " Boman here and I belong to the most destructive group of men in the history of the world . That 's our work . " Daphne looked at me questioningly , as if to ask whether I associated myself with these statements , and I believe I gave my head the slightest negative shake . Her look , then , of only a moment'sduration , dissolved me altogether . I had from that instant onward no question in my mind that Daphne really did prefer me to Marrow , and that I was quite lost to her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time , I sensed a serious lack in him , and , also for the first time , with Daphne , I was conscious of a gap of nationalities . I felt apologeticabout my American colleague . I determined to explain top145Daphne , at a later meeting , that . . . But what would I explain ? There was something wanting in Marrow 's education . He was uncultured , crude . . . . No , that was hardly it . . . . Ours was a people who liked what money could buy ; we were blunt , open , aggressive . . . . No .. . But I did not need to explain , because already Daphne understoodfar better than I myself did about Buzz Marrow . Dunk Farmer , the tech-three bartender in the officers ' club , was trying to worm his way onto Apollo Holdreth 's crew . A number of us were loafing in the club , playing acey-deucy and shove ha'penny , or just standing at the bar and throwing the bull . It was May twelfth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a mission , for chilly , cheerless , damp weather had kept the Fortresses on the ground , and the combat crews , particularlythose that had nearly completed their tours , were increasingly nervous and bored . Many of the men were drinking , and Marrow and I were at the bar having Scotches ; neither of us was the least bit tight . I was still oppressed by the shadow of doubt about Marrowthat had come over me the previous Sunday , when we had lunched with Daphne . You could tell who was considered the hottest pilot in the Group at any time by watching which man Dunk was trying to do a snow job on . Dunk was a Florida swamp cracker who in peacetimehad been a shouting sort  --  a carnival barker , a honky-tonk singer , a small-time auctioneer . Night after night , in the club , he proclaimed , in his rapid , penetrating , assertive voice , a crude fatalismthat went down well with the fliers . " I figure I 'm a goin ' to die , see , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my number 's up . I don ' give a damn what happens , like I might be in a Flyin ' Fortress , or in a boat , see , and it crash , and if it ain ' my time , hell , it cai n't kill me . Might to cripple me , but it cai n't kill me , not if my number ain ' up . " It was Dunk 's everlasting complaint that he could n't seem top146get sprung from bar duty to combat ; he could n't seem to talk anyoneinto taking him on as a gunner . " Hell , I ben pullin ' treggers ever since I was knee-high to a rabbit tick , " he was saying to Holdreth . " I can shoot real nice . " " All right , Dunk , " Holdreth said . " Tell you what . If my tail gunner gets shot up , I 'll take you on . " " Gee , Major , that 's the nuts , " Dunk said . His voice was delightedbut his face was curiously crestfallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marrow asked Dunk , jerking his head in Holdreth 's direction . Holdreth turned his face quickly toward Marrow and saw that Marrow was grinning at him . " He do n't fly a Fort , " Marrow said . " He flies a f  --  ing windbag . " Holdreth could have made a fight out of that crack , but he chose to turn away . Marrow had been like that for several days  --  edgy , provocative . But there was always a grin balanced on the edge , and it was hard to tell how serious he really was . Doc Randall , our Flight Surgeon , came slouching up to the bar for the first of his invariable pair of nightcaps . Doc was a big man , who carried himself with a stoop , sagging as he walked and never standing up straight , as if he thought it would n't be polite to be too big . He had a free-flowing mustache and a number of warts and moles , and the lines running down by his mouth were deep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge 's pardon . He had huge hands on thin arms , and his gestures were demonstrations of the law of centrifugal force , for once his hands got moving they swung right out to the limit . It was not a bad idea to stand beyond his reach , when talking to Doc , so as not to be clouted by uncontrolled flying objects with fingers on them . Doc mumbled , especially when on the border of being tight , and this made him seem undogmatic , which we fliers liked in a flight surgeon . It was a basic rule of Air Force life that officers of field rank , desk warriors , chaplains , and flight surgeons should be closely watched for signs of cowardice , effeminacy , hypocrisy , or moral turpitude ; Doc was free of all that . He was sturdy , masculine , aggressive , and he had an eagle eye for goof-offs . Right now Dunk Farmer , as he poured the Doc a shot , apparentlybegan to face the possibility that Apollo Holdreth 's tailp147gunner might in fact be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I get a bitch of a pain in my chest when I breathe . Anything I can do about it ? " " Stop breathing , Dunk , " Doc shortly said . " That 'll relieve the pain . " Marrow barked out a laugh . Marrow , I have come to think , was afraid of Doc , and because Buzz was driven to show the world that he was afraid of no man or thing , he took a fierce line with Doc . " Listen , Doc , " he said . " I 'm horny . I get horny after we get all these stand-downs . Why do n't you set up a nice clean hoot house for us fliers ? I got to get me a girl  --  or else get up in the air . " Doc just stood there looking at Marrow . The placid friendlinessin Doe 's stare must have been profoundly upsetting to Marrow , who was itching for a fight . " Flying 's the same as saltpeter , " Marrow said . " It kills the sex urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a lot of it . If you bastardsare going to keep me on the ground all the time , why do n't you give me some relief ? " Doc gave Marrow an unmistakable brush-off . He turned to others at the bar and began discussing with them news that had come over B.B.C. earlier in the evening , of the Axis collapse in North Africa . Von Arnim , Rommel 's successor , had been captured . " Where 's the relief in that ? " Marrow truculently asked . " My office hours begin at six a.m. , " Doc firmly said to Marrow . " At sick quarters . You know where it is . " I saw Marrow blanch . I expected him to say that there was nothing the matter with him , he did n't need a God-damn psychiatrist ; but he held his tongue . Buzz was silent , indeed , for half an hour , but he had a couple of snorts , and he was as tense as a racehorse in the starting chutes . Doc finally left . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a meaningless argument with Braddock . Buzz knocked over Brad 's drink . They had a short tussle . Through some extraordinary-alchemy , their first angry clinch turned into an embrace , and they wheeled on the rest of us , malevolent , leering , crafty . They became collaborators in stirring up violence ; they played on the restlessness of the old hands . Calling for a celebration of the Axis defeat in North Africa , they fomented instead ap148riot that had no joy in it . It was the worst brawl I had ever witnessed  --  orrather , assisted . Marrow and Braddock began firing glasses at the club stove . Dunk Farmer shouted for a halt , and he was rewarded by being carried to the door and thrown out . Othersjoined the disorder  --  began tearing magazines to shreds , throwingdarts at the ceiling . We overturned tables and broke up chairs and smashed bottles of coke and soda , and we tore down the curtainsat the windows . Braddock lit fires in three metal wastebaskets , and the smell of burning paint was acrid and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long rubber nozzle and made as if to fight fire by the issue of urine ; he squirted the walls and tables . There were fist-fights and sounds of splitting wood and the crash of glass , and three men were carried to bed with serious head injuries . " I got my relief , " Marrow said , as we were going to bed. 13I could n't seem to hold formation . I 'd put on a lot of manifold pressure , trying to catch up and pack in tight , then I 'd get afraid I was going to overshoot , and I 'd chop it off and nearly throw my turbos , and I 'd practically lose an engine or two , and I 'd have to pour it on again . My feet felt frozen solid ; they hurt like the devil , but I was certainly not going to admit it . I remember , more than anything else , my feeling of helplessness . When I had got up that morning , I had had a distinct impression that I must have been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth had tasted like the inside of one of those wastebaskets Braddock had fired . I had been so foggy that I had put on a pair of badly shrunken wool socks , and long before we had reached altitude the blood had stopped pumping to my feet , and they had grown colder and colder . As soon as we reached the enemy coast the German fighters whom we called the Abbeville Kids , in yellow-nosed FW-rgcs , reactedagainst us , with attacks from ahead , split-assing right in frontp149of us at two hundred yards , or going on through the formation . I was nervous , and my feet were torturing me , and I flew badly . The target was the airplane factory of S.N.C.A. du Nord at Meaulte , not too deep in France , and somehow we got there and home again . My flying was atrocious , there was no doubt of it , and , hung as Marrow was , his was superb . No sooner had we got down than Marrow started eating me out . It was the first time I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said I flew according to poop . No imagination . Everything I did was in the book . Gradually it got worse . " You are n't thinking about anything but yourself , " he said , " and you know how that hurts everyone back of you in the formation . Other words , you 're just flying along and any correction you make , it 's just for yourself , you 're not thinking it 's got to be smooth and help the other jokers in the formation , doing it gradual  --  you know ? You got to remember that whole formation out behind . You 're going to start the whole Goddamnthing accordioning . " The condescending tone in his voice crushed me  --  as if he were lecturing a flying cadet who still had his diapers on . I guess he was making good on his claim of being one of the super-destructivemen of this world . To me the most interesting part of all , looking back on it , was the extent to which I allowed him to be destructive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; my slipped morale let him see what he could do . After the interrogation I rode out alone on my bike and lay on my back in a meadow of feed grass of some sort that was alreadytwo feet tall , so that all around me there was stockade of slender green shoots , tipped with the fuzz of half-formed seed scales , fencing me in from the sunny day . What was the matter with me , anyway ? Was it all because I was small ? My bad flying could n't be just because I was short . I 'd been over that plenty of times . Being short made a lot of people sorry for me , and others despised me , and others thought they had to take care of me when I wanted it least , and others kidded me to make themselves feel bigger  --  and I knew all these things , and Ip150The others had gone , and we had been left behind . Buzz and I stood on the hardstand , looking at The Body . Buzz made a show of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " The first time she stood me up . I feel like I caught some guy in bed with one of my girls . " It was May fourteenth . The Group had taken off on a mis-150 THE WAR LOVERknew they had an effect on me . They put me on the defensive and made me try to show what I could do , on my own . But I was n't going to let them make me cocky . I was n't going to be a typical shorty  --  noisy and pushy , declaring myself all over the place . With two minutes of his belittling talk , Marrow had set me right back to the refrain of my teens . A breeze stirred the grass around me , and I began to study the swaying , juicy tubes , crisscrossing against an unusually crisp blue sky , and I forgot Marrow , and I thought of Daphne , and I was vividly conscious of being alive ; intense gratitude fell on me , like a cool shower . I remembered images from a certain day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its massive concrete counterweighton the far side of the river , and my dog , Lad , a more-orlesscollie with a reddish tail curving up and forward over his back , the tail incessantly fanning ; a perfect sky ; a crazy towhee in the sweet birch in our yard , shouting , " Trick or treat ! Trick or treat ! " And my gentle father , who had never spanked me , looking at me with a pained expression , saying , " Son , this was supposed to be your job . " He did the job himself , before my eyes , whatever it was . Yes , I assumed on slightest provocation a disapproving attitude toward myself and readily took the blame for things that were not my fault . How shrewdly Marrow sensed this ! And moved in . And , moving in , opened the way to crippling himself , because his appetite for destructiveness was insatiable , insatiable.  |p151sion  for two big submarine-building yards at Kiel , Germania Werft and Deutsche Werke , but we had been crossed off the list because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found some trouble in a turbo and had grounded The Body . Black was up on a wing , opening up the cowling of the ailing engine . Marrow approached , and he called up , " Sergeant Black ! " A screwdriver was put down on the wing with more energy than was necessary , and a dark-haired , pale-faced head appeared over the leading edge of the wing . " Listen to me , Sergeant , " Marrow said . . . and out came a tirade , for Marrow could not stand frustration  --  least of all , frustrationof his urge to fly . Our crew chief was a strange bird . He was subject to lightning changes of temper . Immediately after having been talking with us on the hardstand , early any morning before a take-off , in an obviouslyjolly mood , beaming like a seraph and going off trolling snatches from I 'm Dreaming of a White Christmas or Waltzing Matilda in a loud voice , off key , he could suddenly be heard to have switched , with no apparent cause , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowtorch and banging tools down on the skin of our poor ship . " And he 's a bastard , too , a second f  --  ing lieutenant of a bastard . " Black was a small man in his early thirties with a big pocked plow of a nose . Not at all a standardizedhe went around in coveralls but swung the upper part off his shoulders and let the loose folds and sleeves hang down from his belted waist , and his dead-white arms were always streaked with black grease marks . I do n't know why he was nicknamedRed , unless as a tribute to his temper . He was outwardly servile toward all officers from the rank of first lieutenant upwards , but he seemed to consider second loocys like me some speciesof schoolboy , to be hazed and gulled at every turn . Under his fawning manners there lurked a tyrant . Let a corporal from the motor pool make a false move on our dispersal point , and Red would land on him like a hod full of mortar . " You ! Where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under that wing ! " But the other members of the ground crew swore by the chief , whose meticulousness as a mechanic and whose worship of The Body were unbounded . He was a dedicated workman  --  and this was precisely the point on which Marrow attacked him.  |p152Our  lives depended on Black 's carefulness , yet Marrow accusedhim , in vile , insulting terms , of being too cautious . Black appeared to be in an agony of agreeableness as Marrow undermined his talent , his triple-checking cautiousness . Marrow said Red should have let the turbo go another day , so The Body would not have missed a mission ; if we 'd lost an engine  --  so what ? Ships came home every day on three . Marrow made it out that Black 's care was a kind of timidity , and that such timidity would lose us the war . In the end Marrow made Black 's finest quality as a mechanic seem traitorous . We played in a pickup ball game with some ground-gripperswhile the mission was being flown , that day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing arm . Funny : that made me sore . I guessed I was as bright as Haverstraw , taking aptitudesfor number concepts and for verbal concepts together . It was just that I was n't a lousy idiot savant . Your mathematical nut ( Haverstraw ) would always be flashier than your all-round , sociallyadjusted , intelligent high achiever ( Boman ) . And when Buzz found out that Haverstraw could remember his dames ' phone numbers for him and peg a ball like Peewee Reese , he went all the way off his conker . Phooey on that . Later that afternoon I felt low . I wanted to quit the whole show . I sat in our room , alone , and I could hear test-firing at the clay bank , and as I looked through the window at the meadow on the near side of the flight line , an English farmer crossed in the middle distance , plodding behind six Guernsey cows , oblivious , apparently , to the firing ; he looked neither to right nor left but simply kept on walking with a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My chest ached for Daphne.  |p15316  /At the interrogation after a mission we flew the next day , May fifteenth , we caught , as our interrogating officer , an applecheckedcaptain from Wing Headquarters , who wore an unconvincingmustache , more a plea than a declaration . This mother 's boy got off on the wrong foot with us right away , by asking which mission this had been for us . It was our sixth . " Oh , " he said , on a groaning note , which had the effect of dismissing us as beginners , and therefore unreliable . We had thought ourselves rather seasoned . The interrogation was held in the briefing hut , into which a number of small tables had been moved . An interrogator sat at each table , with a stack of report forms before him , and he took on one crew at a time . When our turn came , we of The Body gatheredaround the pink-faced young captain 's table , some sitting and some standing ; we were still in flying gear , with our jackets unzipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , and several of us held white mugs of coffee . Well , our child captain began giving us a hard time . It seemed that neither he nor any of the other interrogators , even our own from the Group , were too well satisfied with our day 's work . They did n't quite believe we 'd been where we said we 'd been  --  or that we knew where that was . By rights , the mission should have hiked our morale , because , having been briefed for some sub yards at Wilhelmshaven , our Group had led the mission out over the North Sea , and we had n't climbed to altitude until twelve minutes before the target , so we had been comfortable and warm all that time , and not even on oxygen . The primary target , besides throwing up considerable flak , which Handown now called " iron cumulus , " had been under ten-tenths cloud , so , with no briefed secondary target , we had wheeled full circle and had gone out to sea and had bombed what Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What made us think it was Helgoland ? Under pressure from the baby captain , Marrow grew ugly , and he began to jump his own crew.  |p154First  he piled into Haverstraw , of all people  --  teacher 's pet ; asked for his log of the mission right there at the interrogation table , to check it and prove we 'd been to Helgoland , but it turned out from his record that Clint had had no idea whatsoever where we 'd flown . " I figured the Colonel knew what he was doing , " Clint lamely said . Marrow took off on Brains ; really scored Clint for a mental defective . Next it was Farr 's turn . In the background of the anxious cross-examination , we could hear the Jughead muttering about Wing 's having sent us to a target covered by solid cloud , without a secondary target , and so on ; all in Farr 's nastiest whine . Jughead'scomplaints about what he considered to be the futile and suicidal missions the bicycle generals had been devising for us were getting on our nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoiled child . He made outrageous demands on all of us , and alternatelyexploded with dangerous rages and wheedled for sympathy , irritated us and charmed us , abused us and flattered us . IIe blew up over nothing like a child and saw reality with the clear eyes of a child . Indeed , his complaints were largely justified ; he railed against conditions the rest of us were doing our best to ignore . Marrow , in a white heat of defending himself against the baby-face , turned on Farr and told him to shut his big mouth before he , Marrow , pasted it shut . Farr fell silent , but after the briefing he rounded up several of the crew and , in a barely audible murmur , said that Marrow was too weak to carry legitimate beefs to Wing . It took our breath away to hear Marrow called a lily-liver , and Handown spoke for all of us when he told Farr he was only bellyachingbecause Marrow had shut him up . He reminded Farr that Marrow had in fact been to Wing to grouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than lots of other pilots had done.  |p155It  had been a very early mission , and we were all through by lunchtime , and we had just turned in for some luxurious afternoonsack time when a voice on the Tannoy ordered all combat crews to report to the tower in olive drab on the double , to be taken to the dispersals to stand review by some personages . I had to wake Marrow up , and he was so mad he was speechless . We got out there and stood around for an hour , and then a batch of about six Rolls-Royces and Bentleys whizzed by on the perimeter track , and we could see the procession stop a couple of stands down , at Angel Tread , Wheatley Bins ' ship , for about ten minutes . Then it sped on and ducked in by the hangars and hurriedpast the Admin building and cut out the main gate . When we got in , we were told we 'd been visited by Their UndoubtedMajesties , the King and Queen of England , together with their retinue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this injury of cursoriness , Generals Eaker , Longfellow , Hansell , and several other unidentified U.S.A.A.F. officers of whom we had n't seen hide nor hair in all those dangerousweeks . Marrow reacted to this with a crazy fury that Their Royal Jackasses , as he called them , had stopped at Angel Tread rather than at The Body . He went on with an elaborate , carefully detailed , and quite devastating analysis of Wheatley Bins ' flying technique . Buzz made a convincing argument that he was a far better flier than Bins . I think , in justice , that he was . Through the dance Daphne sat at a table with me in a corner , wearing around her bare shoulders a scarf of pale , bluegray , gauzy material , something I could have reached out of the cockpit and grabbed on the way to Helgoland that morning , andp156with her eyes rather heavily made up , she looked as if she had been weeping , though in fact she seemed happy in my company . We talked about the King and Queen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . I was attentive to her ; she was acknowledged to be my girl , and I did not have to worry about her drifting off with some guy ( Janet 's trick : she used to get me hot as a firecracker at a party and then disappear , just leave the party with a total stranger ) , and I called fliers over to meet her and talk with her . I danced with her now and then just to have my arm around her ; she was responsive , and I felt unhurried and extravagantly alive . Marrow hung around , but he was plastered . He kept singing , What Shall We Do With a Drunken Pilot ? The answer , in successivestanzas , was , " Put him in the nose of a Flying Fortress , so earlye in the morning , " and , " He will bomb the blind and pregnant . . . he will bomb their homes and churches . . . he will bomb their turnip patches . . . . " Marrow had a cherubic expression as he sang these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard . During one of the times when we were alone at the table I said I 'd heard she 'd had some sort of tragedy  --  lost her first importantman , supposed to be a Spit pilot , or something . I thought I was being sympathetic ; the illusion that Daph had been crying was strong at that moment . " Do n't ask me about other men , " Daphne said , and the way she put it made her seem not self-pitying but instead inclined to spare me pain . " Let 's try ... " But impulsively she told me a little about the man . She called him only Dugger ; whether this was a last name or a nickname I never asked . He had been a great R.A.F. bomber pilot who , she said , could n't get enough , and upon the completion of his regular tour he had transferred to night fighters , and he had grown more and more daring , or suicidal , until , it was said , he had led his entiresquadron in pursuit of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to their airdrome in England . Word had come home through prison-camp escapees that Dugger himself had been killed . Then , with a somber expression , Daphne said , " He was like a blood brother to your pilot . " " Marrow ? "  | " As like as two peas in a pod . In character , I mean . " I was n't sure I relished that likeness , but Daphne stared at me with a sort of helplessness ; she looked as if she were skidding and could n't stop . " My father was killed in the Blitz , " she said , " too . " " I 'm sorry , " I said , and I knew at once that that was a stupid response . But Daphne went back to talking , half-heartedly , about bugger , and then her voice drifted off , and she looked as if she had forgotten what she wanted to say . So I laid off the subject of other men , and she never came back to it until the day we went to Hampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , all purpose , and all meaning seemed to be encompassed in each moment 's perceptions . An edge of Daphne 's scarf against the white tablecloth , an ash tray with our crumpled cigarettes ( Daphne 's butts were short , frugal ) , my Scotch with a ring of shining soda bubbles around the glass at the surface , a sensitive trembling of Daphne 's mouth at the beginning of a smile : I had the impression that each image was immensely important  --  that the enjoyment of life , which might end some early morning soon high in the sky , could not be more than a savoring of these glimpses . I had seen that Daphne always experienced every moment with deep and easily available emotion , and my own feelings were greatly heightened . I respondedstrongly to absurd trivialities . Our bar used plastic swizzlesticks embossed with the phrase , BUNDLES FOR BERLIN ; some pilot'sold man manufactured such things and had given us a trillion gross of them , though as yet we had by no means the capability of carrying anything as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end of such a stick , as if it were a marvel of nature , a salmon 's egg or an immense dewdrop on a rose petal , and I experienced a kind of ecstasy ; then I felt with my finger tips the sharp edges of the thing , and I took extraordinary pleasure in my sense of touch . I bent the stick . It broke . I felt intensely sad , as if I had snapped something of great value . At about midnight there was a drumroll and up stood GeneralMinott , himself , our Wing Commander , and in an unbecomingmanner , almost groveling , he vindicated us for that morning 's mission ; acknowledged that strike photos showed that we had , inp158truth , hit the Helgoland base and had done damage to naval installations . The din in the place was deafening ; our joy  --  not at having hurt the enemy but at having bested Wing  --  was unbounded . While the celebration of the announcement was still going on , Marrow showed up in the doorway , with a fierce grimace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand a lighted candle . " Hey , Braddock ! " I heard him shout . " Get your ass over here . " ' When Brad joined him , Buzz climbed on his shoulders and rode pick-a-back out onto the cleared place that served as a dance floor . Daphne was convinced that he was going to set fire to the mess hall . I said he was a crazy goop but not that far gone . Waving the smoking taper and shouting incoherently , Buzz rode to the center of the floor and , with many a hitch of his balance on poor Braddock 's shoulders , he wrote in smoke on the ceiling : TO HELLWITH HELLAGOLAND . As the message unfolded , men standing with girls around him cheered him , and the cheers seemed to make him wildly happy . As usual , some pilots from the  --  th Group had crashed our party , and Marrow got into an argument with one of them over which group had dropped its bombs more accurately that day , killed more Krauts , and Marrow proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the Senior Officers ' Mess , so four or five guys ran out for bicycles , and others pushed tables around to make an oval track , and Marrow and Benny Chong were selected to compete for us . As the desperate , aimless wildness of our men grew , with Marrowin the forefront of the restlessness , I found that I was becoming more and more embarrassed , in Daphne 's presence , over the behavior of my companions . It was national pride again ; it was because she was English . I felt sure an R.A.F. party would not have turned out like this . Australians would have been like this , yes , but not Englishmen . We were crazy frontiersmen . " We do n't know what we 're fighting about , " I said . " Our peoplehave n't been hurt the way yours have . " I got talking with Daphne then about how badly prepared I 'd been for war . I said I 'd waded through translations of both Mein Kamp f and Das Kapital but had n't got wet while wading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I should have been , perhaps , better than most . I had had at best a passive acceptance of my country 's part in the conflict . I washed my hands of responsibility , saying that Grew and Hull should have been better aware of the true intentions of the Japanese , and should have avoided conflictby diplomatic means . I guess this was all college stuff ; Janet stuff . I regarded war as a struggle between the haves and the have-nots , and I said , " You ca n't really blame the Japanese and Germans and Italians for wanting to live as well as we do . " I brushed aside the notion of the Axis threat to our way of life , saying , " There 's plenty that 's not so hot about us . " But even about " us " I was unclear , unsharp . I told Daphne that my father used to talk about the Depression ; being at the time engrossed in geography ( for there could n't have been a sky without an earth ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lowered place in Pennsylvania , not exactly a valley but rather a kind of crease where there was unfamiliar misery and want . I was too young for it , and anyway , my father , being a doctor , escaped the worst of it , because sickness did not fall off along with jobs , and enough people could pay their bills so that my brother Jim and I always ate . Daphne said she did n't think that wars were started on account of economics . " That 's what all the books say , " I said . She said something about men like her Dugger . . . but then the bike race began , and we lost that thread . The four cyclists rode a couple of laps , and everyone was shouting , and Benny crashed ( accidentally on purpose ? ) into the bar , and scores of glasses were broken . People began throwing glasses then , and Marrow got into a fist-fight with one of the crashers and wound up with a shiner and a bad cut on his knuckle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth of one of those uninvitedwisers . I suggested to Daphne that we get out of there . Outside it was a fine May night , and we found Daphne 's bus and sat in it , holdinghands . I had no thought of where our feelings would lead us . I was caught up in the widespread delusion that men who exposed themselves to death had no moral responsibility , and in my selfcenteredhaze I felt that Daphne asked nothing of me except myp160company , my good manners , my absorption in her , my strong erotic desire for her . I would have sworn that I had never been so happy , and that the same went for her . We had an alert the following evening , and after it , Marrow suggested that we ride our bikes out to say good night to the ship . He was still in his combative mood . We 'd had a critique of the Helgoland raid that morning , and Marrow had got into a pointless squabble with Wheatley Bins , over a technical point  --  how our intervalometers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Marrow was wrong and Bins right , but Buzz had hung onto the quarrel with a tenacity that exposed his true feeling about Bins . And as we rode out to The Body under a partly cloudy night  --  it looked as if great uneven fields of stars had fallen to the ground , leaving black holes where they had been  --  Marrow railed in a monotone about a group in Bins ' squadron that he called " Bins ' clique . " But I could think only of Daphne  --  of the pressure of her knee against mine under the table the night before . I felt a joyous pain in my chest . . . . The Body loomed , gray and dull , in the darkness of the blackedoutbase . Marrow slapped the side of the fuselage . " Good night , baby , " he said . And I said , " Good night , " too , but my message had some distance to fly in the night . We were in the low squadron of the lead group , and Braddock was flying the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Eighth Bomber Command riding along asp161a tourist , and they were perhaps two hundred yards above us and ahead of us , the craft a glinting silver tube against a midday cat'stailsky . We were coming home from Lorient . It had been an early mission : up at two forty-five , briefing at three thirty . Since we had been to Lorient on our very first mission , we had felt a blase detachment about the assignment , and indeed , the morning had seemed to go easily . After sunup the sky had been a pale semiglobeof sapphire , flawed only by a thin sheet of frosty cirrus over Europe . There had been no ground haze ; no contrails had formed ; the target had been visible from forty miles away . Enemy oppositionhad been relatively light and had concentrated on formations other than ours . The bombing had been fair . At the rally point Marrow had suddenly asked Haverstraw , in order to check up on Clint 's alertness , what the bearing would have been to the secondarytarget . Haverstraw , apparently having thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had n't had the faintest idea how to answer , and now Marrow had just finished eating him out . Braddock 's ship was named Bull Run . Braddock was Marrow 's good friend , but I scarcely knew him , except as a ton of prime meat , a big , tall , fat man , about whom I had heard it said that he was incredibly cool and steady in the air ; his nervous system must have been primitive , like a whale 's . I had not even stopped to think who else was in his ship besides the tourist : eight nobodies ; to me , the plane was simply Braddock up there , Bull Run . We were going along all right . We had flown through some of Handown 's " iron cumulus " over the target , but none of our Group had been knocked down , and it was good , leaving the rally point , not to have any fighters around , and to have such a clear sky , with home and rest ahead , and we were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying a word on VHF about fighters , though the general , being new , was chattering a lot of nonsense . On the whole we were comfortable , with another mission , The Body 's seventh , practically under our belts ; it was really wonderfulup in the sky streaking for England . Then Marrow was pointing . Up there , Braddock 's ship . And I thought , Look out , Brad , look out , look out , you 're smoking , number two 's smoking.  |p162I  could not take my eyes off the thin gray telltale of smoke , more than exhaust but less than peril as yet ; it did not blow out . Someone came up on VHF to tell Braddock he was burning , and at that the whole Group was alert to his danger . Suddenly the smoke went black , and there were visible flames , pale against the sky , and it seemed to me that the ships of the formation edged in closer ( it was a fact that Marrow pushed up the manifold pressure ) to watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his position above us and began a shallow power glide to try to blow the fire out , and just then Max Brindt shouted on our interphone , " Look out ! What the f  --  is that ? " ' What was it ? What was it ? Something had come off Bull Run and went flipping past us . I realized it was the little rear hatch door ; the tail gunner must have kicked it out . No , it would n't be the tail gunner in the lead ship with a tourist aboard . It would be the co-pilot , because under the circumstances he would be back there flying tail-gunner observer , watching the formation and reportingeverything up to the general , so the general could make a fool of himself with a full supply of information ; it would have been myself back in that tail position if we had been leading the Wing . I had a moment 's fantasy that it was I who had kicked out that small flipping plate ; I was getting out . I remembered then with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pale fellow who never seemed to speak a word  --  an impression of white , white skin with a heavy black stubble of beard , a face immobileand silent . There came a leg , and another , and Kozak was squeezing out like a creature being born , and I almost shouted on the radio , " Look out , Kozy ! Christ , there are over a hundred ships here , we 're all coming at you . " Surely Kozak had thought of just that , or surely he would not have done what he did . He ripped his chute the moment he was out . He was too excited . His body , fresh from the speeding Fort , was going through the air at more than a hundred fifty miles per hour . I saw a flutter of shining nylon , flaglike at first , then what seemed to be a big Ioose bunch of feminine understuff , and we were all coming up at it  --  he 'd been small before and now , with the breaking parachute , he seemed massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every bone in his body must have broken , he just  --  hisp163back  --  we were right close under him  --  when the chute filled , his back arched and flapped like a ribbon snapping out in a wind ; it must have killed him on the instant , the way he  --  Kozy , he jumped to save himself but he was dead , because of the speed we were all going up there , and he did n't wait . He just snapped , mind and body . What he thought would happen , with all those ships , he must have thought someone would run into him , that was the way I judged it , and he bailed out and did not hold his count , be must have been afraid of all those props , because we were coming all around him , and he was going to drift back through the formation , and he must have thought that if he could just get his parachuteopen right away , we 'd all see him and could evade ; but that was the wrong idea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . If I 'd been the tail-gunner observerin the lead ship , Kozy , I 'd have dropped and dropped , a delayed jump , clear down to those newly forming white fluffy clouds on the edge of this high-pressure area of sparkling blue , a long , long drop , more than fifteen thousand feet ; way down . That 's what I 'd have tried to do . Arms against the sides . Knees up .. . But you 're dead , Kozy , from trying too hard to be alive . I had thought it was easy to get out , no problem , just get out and wait and pull and float down ; that 's what I had thought . Maybe it was n't so easy . I had never let myself think about that . Braddock 's plane was quite far ahead and below , now , perhaps a thousand feet down , going very fast and pulling forward and down and away , but the smoke was worse than ever and flames were pouring back off the wing , not blowing out at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camp stove blown on with a deep breath . Braddock started to climb . As he got halfway back up to our height I noticed that Buzz had begun to climb in key with him , and I looked out and saw that we were all climbing , we were all flying formation behind and above Braddock 's black plumes . We 're going up with you , Brad , do n't worry , we 're sticking with you . No , not like that , we ca n't climb like that . Hey . Hey . Do n't climb that way . You 're out of control , you 're going right up to the top . What an impressive sight !  --  a big Fort shooting straight up , ahead of us in the sky . Your smoke . Such a clear day . . . No ! No ! No ! iip164He blew up . Right at the top , right in front of us , the whole thing . That smoke  --  why did n't you all jump ?  --  that smoke  --  fire , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then everything . Two or three flashes . . . He blew up . Buzz ! Look out for all that crap ! Twenty , thirty tons of bits , we 're going to fly right into the stuff . Look at it . Look at that big piece of metal . Head down , cover eyes , do n't look . Nothing 's happening , we 're diving . It 's past us . Marrow , good work , Marrow . What an explosion that was ! I even heard it , I think I heard it , and that would be unusual at altitude , in all one 's gear , and that far away ; it made such a big thud I think I heard it in the cockpit . Now it was quiet . A minute before everyone had been chatteringon VHF , everybody making his big remark , we had been talking away and then everyone stopped . It was such an impressive sight . Now there was n't a sound , and there were more than a hundredForts around us , but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one was saying a word , not even an exclamation . Why did n't somebody speak ? It was so quiet . I wished somebody would come up and talk . There . There it was . High squadron . " Well , form on me . We 'd better take over and do something . " There , that was better . Junior Sailen called in . He had n't heard anything , you understand . Only Buzz and I and Lamb in the radio room could hear the VHF , and Buzz had only pointed at Braddock . Just that one remark of Max 's . Sailen cut in on interphone from the ball turret , down under the plane , asking , " Say , what was all that junk that went past us ? " Marrow answered . " Braddock , " he said . " That was Braddock . " " Any chutes ? " Junior said . " Anybody see any chutes ? " Marrow asked . Max Brindt in the nose said , " One out of the tail . The guy ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " That pale guy . " Then little Junior Sailen , down in the close cocoon in which he flew , said in a low voice , icy dead cold , " I knew it . I knew it . You ca n't get out of these God-damn crates . " It hit me . Nobody had got out . Not one . They all died . Kozakp165died . Braddock died . That general . Ten men dead . I had always thought you could get out of a Fort , it was so big . Plenty of hatches . But maybe you would n't get out . You 'd just sit there and get killed . You could n't escape . I thought : I 'm scared . Somebody 's got to help me . Look at Marrow , maybe he 'll help . Oh , Jesus , look at Buzz , he 's smiling at me . He can see I 'm scared . I see his eyes smiling behind his goggles to buck me up . He wants to tell me something , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a piece of tail , he 's goingto speak to me , he 's pushing the interphone button on his wheel with his thumb , he 's going to say something to all of us . " It ca n't happen to this bucket , boys , not while I 'm in it ! " 21/I was in rough shape when I got to Cambridge . We went to a pub and drank quite a lot , and to my amazementI blurted out , " Why do you love someone as short as I am ? " There had been no mention of love . Daphne hung her head and said , " Everything 's so mixed up . " I understood that she was not really answering my question . There was a woman at the next table , a pretty but hard-lookingblonde , a working girl , waiting for a man , or hoping for one . She was getting drunk and angry . The owner of the pub crossexaminedher about her expectations . Stridently she insisted that someone was coming to meet her , though she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young Americans , one in a leather flight jacket and the other in a crimson nylon basketball windbreaker with the nickname of his unit applied in cursive script across the back , were playing darts . The owner managed to hustle the girl out of the place , but not before she had drawn a great deal of attention to his inhospitality . Stirred by the sight of the blonde 's loneliness to an awareness of my good fortune in Daphne 's company , I began to recite some sentimental verses : " I dreamed I stood in a valley of lovers , " and " Wine comes in at the mouth , " and " I whispered : I am toop166young , " and I was carried away on a flood of emotion , so that at certain lines my voice caught in my throat because the words seemed so valid for Daphne and for me . Her eyes had a way of melting , her lids sagging down , when I came close to a truth about her , and I was half choked when I spoke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes .... " Daphne had a curious trait . She felt things deeply , I knew , and when she was moved her face would soften and grow pink , full of warm , warm blood , and her eyelids would droop in that way , and sometimes a hand would move spasmodically toward me , but suddenly her mouth would say something that seemed to me quite out of key : that seemed to me almost harsh . This time she abruptly began to recite : " ... Here , said she , Is your card , the drowned Phoenician Sailor . ( Those are pearls that were his eyes . Look ! ) Here is Belladonna , the Lady of the Rocks ... " I suddenly felt cold and gloomy . The Channel ! Each time we went out , and each time we came back , I dreaded crossing England'smoat : just to think of that choppy , frigid stripe of water gave me a chill . But one glance at Daphne 's face relieved me , for she was blandly looking at me , with a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simply nice words she liked ; she was not trying to say anything , except perhaps that I had let my batteries get overcharged . My verses and hers  --  there was the gulf between us . Naive sentiment ; powerful irony . A nice clean-cut American boy ; a woman on the edge of a Europe in agony . But I insisted on being serious in my own way . I reached out my hand and touched Daphne 's cheek , and with the slightest movement of her head , pressing her cheek against my palm , she acceded to my seriousnessand confirmed her surrender . " Dear , dear Bo , " she said . " My darling ! " I said . It was the first time I had used that word , the first time I had claimed her . Daphne gave me her liquefied look , and her cursed little mouth changed the subject . " Your pilot , " she said , " has a wild look in his eye . "  |p167For  a moment , driven back from my intimacy with Daphne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braddock 's plane that morning , and I said , " Remember , the other night , when Buzz was burning those words in the ceiling , the guy whose shoulders he was riding on ? " Daphne , obviously having sensed the intensity of my question , nodded and searched my eyes with hers . " This morning . . . " I began , and then the bottle of my feelings broke , and I put my forehead down on the edge of the table and cried . " Steady , steady , " I heard Daphne say . In the midst of my dramaticsI felt a startling sharp amusement that she had fallen back on a standard English response to a public show of emotion . Stiff upper lip . Must dress . Pip pip . I had to laugh . The realization that I was on the edge of hysteria quieted me at once , and I sat up . " Good man , " Daphne said . " What the hell 's it all about ? " I feelingly said . " Why do we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just try to get from day to day withouttoo much fuss . " As if to say : she was a girl , she had nothing to do with war except to endure it . I had a feeling of utter helplessness , almost like what I had felt in the nose of the ship that time on our first raid , when Marrowhad suddenly pushed over and I had hung weightlessly floating in mid-air along with some inanimate objects . I was being carried along toward death through a life over which I had no control . I remembered experiencing at the dance the previous Saturday , if not happiness , at least an approach to it , through close attention to momentary impressions : seeing small things with a clear eye . I now tried to recapture that observant and receptive state , but all I saw this time was banality : a glass of warm and soapy stout ; a half-eaten and anyway barely edible piece of cold kidney pie ; the owner of the bar , savoring his triumph over the blonde , muttering out loud and flicking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed in his mind to be aging prostitutestrying to trump up trade on his decent premises . And even Daphne : her sleeve was shiny at its cuff ; from an American point of view there was something shabby about her.  | " Bo , " she said . " Dear Bo . You do n't like me very much just at this minute , do you ? " Startled at her perceptiveness , I said , " It 's not you , Daph . " She took me to her room and sat me down on the edge of her bed and urged me to tell her about what had happened that morning , and I did . She made no attempt to comment , but I had a curious impression of a deep satisfaction she had from listening to me . What I said was less important to her than the fact of my saying it . I was spewing out bitterness , retching ; she seemed profoundlyhappy . What a way to court a girl ! Yet it was , I think , exactly appropriate to that place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , gradually , hearing me out with big reflective eyes , she instilledin me a feeling , not exactly of strength , but at least of resiliency ; a hide in tanning grows flexible.  |p169'We  crossed the Dutch islands at 510351N-03040'E , at four minutes before two o'clock , flying at twenty-one thousand feet , and of course Marrow had taken back control of the ship before our penetration of the enemy zone . My rage at him , over what Clint had blurted to me of his lying tale of having mounted my Daphne , had ebbed away , but I was still aware of him , across from me , as a kind of adversary , along with the German , on this long day 's flight which was now entering its dangerous phase . Yes , Marrow was my enemy , just as surely as the Nazis were . One contest was a matter of life and death ; the other , against Marrow , whose life was bound with mine to our common ship , was one of inner tensions , of all those personal values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , if life remained , worth or not worth living . For Daphne had shown me the truth about Marrow . I-le was a destroyer . He was in love with war . I could have no peace  --  the world could have none  --  if men like him were indulged in their passion . Being now convinced that Marrow , whom the Group consideredmy closest friend , was in fact my most intimate enemy , I became alert for signs of vulnerability in him , and here , as we crossed over the huge islands of man-made land at the edge of Europe , I began thinking there had been indications all throughp170the morning of something which in many men would have seemed to be strength but in Marrow could only have been weakness . I mean caution . In a superb flier like Marrow a certain carefulness was inbuilt and natural , and his indifference to inspections and checks , during the period when he had become a hero and had gotten his D.F.C. , was abnormal for him ; but an excess of cautionin Marrow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been checking up on things too much . Now , out of the blue , he came up on interphone to the engineer . " Listen , Handown , " he said . " Did that son of a bitch Black say anything to you about changing the hydraulic fluid ? " " Negative , " Handown said . " he was supposed to change it , " Marrow said . " Did n't say anything about it , " Handown said . " I forgot to ask him , " Marrow said . " Meant to ask him . " " The pressure was O.K. this morning , " I said . " I checked it in the preflight . Both accumulators were O.K. " " It was O.K. , huh ? " Marrow said . " He was going to put new fluid in . " I knew all about that kind of worrying . During the July Blitz , when we had flown so many missions so close together , I had done plenty of it . I used to begin at the beginning  --  wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if they 'd figured all the stresses correctly , if the wingloading was right ; and I 'd heard somewhere that if you dived a Fort at more than three hundred miles per hour the de-icing boots on the leadingedge of the wing would begin to rise slightly , and then more and more , and would begin to flap and then tear and then . . . And when I 'd finished with the designers , I 'd wonder about the people who put The Body together . Workers in a factory had meat rationing and gas rationing to worry about , poor bastards , and after dozens and dozens of planes , performing the same operation , they could have gotten careless , wondering where their next sirloin was coming from . I used to think there might have been an inspector whose wife was having a baby the day he inspected The Body , and he was n't concentrating the way he ought to , and he missed a whole seam that was supposed to have been riveted but had n't . Once , during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me " teacher " because I had been so finicky about in/spections , I actually went back in the plane , on some excuse or other , and began looking for places where the rivets were n't right . ... Then , when I got through with the workers at the plant , I 'd start in on the ground crew . There was so much they could go wrong on ! Four motors , each with a million parts . A hydraulic system as complicated as the water-main system of Donkentown . A wiring system like that of a big building . Radios . Tires . Brakes . Cables . They could n't check everything . What had they forgotten ? What had they skipped ? What had they got in the habit of skipping ? If Red Black had worked twenty-four hours a day , he could n't have begun to check The Body . I used to spend hours up there cataloguing the things he might have missed . That obsessive concern for details of The Body 's health was all very well for me , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way . But when it began cropping up in Marrow , it was time to stop fussing about the plane and start watching him. 2/Ahead of us , now , the layer of cirrus that I had seen from over the Channel was building up , and its base at the edge of the cloud , which was perhaps ten miles away , was no higher than we . The formation therefore had to make one of two choices , neither good . The first was to trust that deep into Europe this was only a thin sheet of mackerel cloud , as it seemed at first to be , and so to rise above it ; the risk in this alternative was that the cloud might thicken and tower too high for us , and that the whole formation might be forced to plunge into it and inevitably scatter  --  or that the target might be obscured . The second possibility was to abandonour briefed base altitudes , between twenty-three thousand and twenty-six thousand five hundred feet , and duck below the cloud mass ; here the risks lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flak and fighters , our providing the fighters with cover above our heads , and our possibly having to descend ever lower , to altitudes unsafe for our special sort of work . I spoke of the cloud to Marrow on interphone , partly , I sup/pose , to probe him , partly to seek reassurance . " How about that cirrus ahead ? " " Keep your pants on , " he said , giving me no comfort at all . " Check in , " said Prien from the tail , and he began to count us off , and as he did I visualized our plane , and the men in it , and this gave me comfort , for I worried about The Body and loved her , not in Marrow 's erotic way , but because she was familiar , and reliable , and her interior walls curved about me , cuppingme as I took life-giving nourishment from her oxygen tubes ; perhaps because I had entrusted my existence to her so many times . " One ! " " O.K. , " Max said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very nose , leaning forward in his tense way in the air , bathed in greenishlight . Before him , source of that light , was a conical plexiglass windshield with a lozenge-shaped panel in the middle of its lower part , through which the concentrated sightings for bombardment , the aim and point of our missions , were made . There were also low windows in the plane 's walls on both sides of Max . Just now Max would be ready at the handle of a hand-held fiftycalibermachine gun with a post-and-ring sight which was poked out through a kind of nipple up near the center of the nose ; in action he might also have to jump to another gun farther back in the left side of the nose . To Max 's right , on the side wall , were his oxygen regulator , suit-heater outlet , interphone jackbox , and brackets to stow the nose gun . To his left were his instrument panel and bomb controls : a round-knobbed handle which , along with a switch , worked the bomb-bay doors ; another handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or set them to be toggled out at electrically controlled intervals ; and a release switch , covered by a protective guard , for this toggling . Fastened to the curving wall above these controls was a goose-neck lamp that might have beenp173on an office desk in some peaceful place . The bombsight was still stowed , for freedom of action , back in the navigator 's space . The navigator 's area was directly behind Max 's at a somewhat lower level , but with no physical barrier between the two so-called compartments . Clint Haverstraw 's province was lit by two pairs of windows in the sidewalls , by the navigator 's astrodome overhead , and indirectly by the plexiglass nose . Clint 's desk , with a dial of the radio compass recessed in its right side , stretched across the back of the bombardier 's seat and ran to the right side wall ; on the left was Max 's passageway forward . Along the side wall to Clint 's right were a bulbous driftmeter , a storage box for the bombsight , an aperiodic compass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , beyond the narrow passageway , were the radio compass and its control panel , Clint 's map case , his interphone jackbox , and another oxygen regulator . Everything was neat as a pin ; Clint had even installed a set of grip holders on the wall over his desk to hold a comb . Just now Clint was manning , doubtless with distaste , a fifty-caliber gun that poked out of a large covered window on the right side of the nose , at the forward end of his compartment . A corresponding gun on the left side was Max Brindt 's alternative weapon . Aft of the navigator 's compartment was a section of the plane that was divided into two levels . The upper one was the pilots ' cockpit , and to reach it , one had to climb up through a trapdoor between Buzz 's seat and mine . The space of the lower level , which was only about four feet high , was in part for the storage of large oxygen bottles , but it also provided access to the forward escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . Buzz and I sat at the top of the plane , looking out through a windshield which ran across over the nose ; we had side windows , too . We were , it seemed , embedded in instruments . The main panel spread like a swollen dashboard before us , while the power-plant controls  --  throttles , turbo levers , mixture levers , and propeller-pitch handles  --  were in a central stand between the two flight columns ; below that stand , forward of the trapdoor on the floor between us , was another block containing the automaticpilot with its many knobs and switches ; each of us had a pair of j side control panels , on the wall and floor beside him ; radio-tuning apparatus was on the ceiling above us . Altogether there were morep174than a hundred and fifty dials , switches , levers , indicators , handles , cranks , knobs , buttons  --  any one of which might , at a moment of crisis , save or lose the plane and all of us . Directly in back of the cockpit was the engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the upper turret , above it . This was a ribbed plexiglass dome , shaped something like the gun turret of a tank , with room for Handown 's head and shoulders in it . From it extruded a pair of fifty-caliber guns ; the whole dome could revolve , under power , on a cogged track , while the guns , which Neg fired through an automatic computing sight , could be elevated and depressed by an electrical mechanism . It was a pity Neg had only two hands . There were two handles with which to charge the guns with ammunition ; a pair of hand grips to control the azimuth and elevation of the guns ; triggers on them ; a range knob between them ; and the usual gadgets for heat and oxygen and communication , as well as hand cranks in case the power failed  --  all to be manipulated at once , it seemed , in response to lightning reactions under the threat of death from an attacker . The engineer 's compartment ended at a bulkhead , in the center of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windowlesscavern containing a big vee of racks for the bombs . One had to step down two steps from the doorway to reach a narrow catwalkto the rest of the ship ; I had gone in there one day  --  it was on the Hills mission , on June twenty-second  --  when the bomb-bay doors , like great longitudinal jaws , had been jammed open by a wedge of flak , to help Neg crank them shut by hand , and we had nothing between us and the good earth but twenty thousand feet of air . It took us an hour to fix it . Another time , over Kassel , Max had leaned way down off the catwalk into space to fuse some of his bombs by hand when the arming mechanism had failed . Next , going back , was the radio compartment , Butcher Lamb 's place . This was the only self-contained room-like space on the ship , a kind of cabin , where Butcher , at a table on the left side , operated , as needed , the main controls for the VHF and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radiocompassrecorder , and homing set . The receivers and transmitters were disposed around the room ; in one corner there was a stack of five transmitters which looked something like a high layered office file . Besides Lamb 's seat , there were two others , where Brag-ip175nani and Farr , the waist gunners , commonly sat on take-offs and landings . Behind one of them was lashed a portable emergency transmitter , for use in case of a ditching in the sea . At the end of a mission Butcher 's compartment was littered with pencil stubs , butts , scraps of paper , and , above all , Westerns and comic books in which he immersed himself at crucial moments , sometimes reading while supposedly manning his hand-held gun which pointed rearwardout of a slot at the top of the cabin . Handown caught him doing that once  --  firing when a fighter took a pass at us , then reading a few sentences , then firing again , absent-minded , dreamyeyed , like a certain kind of man fussing with a pipe he is smoking while he reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came next to the ball turret , set like a knuckle in its socket in the bottom of the plane . The ball turret differed from the upper turret in one vital way : Junior Sailen had to let himself down into it and sit in it , hunched up like an embryo , firing between his spread legs , with a door locked above him , and with the whole turret revolving not only in azimuth , as did the upper turret , but also in elevation , as the upper turret did not . In other words , Sailen , locked into the ball , spun and tilted with the motion of the ball , which he controlledhimself by power as he aimed at the enemy . His mechanismswere even more complicated than Neg Handown 's ; in order to adjust the reticles of his gunsight for range he had to use a leftfootpedal , and to press the talk switch of his interphone he had to use his right foot , while he tracked the target with hand grips and fired with switches on top of the grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the ball was properly upright . It was no wonder that Junior had repeatedly made his crewmates swear that they would get him out of the turret if it ever got stuck . Abaft the ball turret was the waist gunners ' post . Here one was in the long tube of the naked fuselage , its walls honeycombed with ribs and frames . Farr on the right and Bragnani on the left would be standing with their guns on brackets pointing out the two large open waist-high windows ; the main entrance door of the plane was to Farr 's right , and beyond that a chemical toilet , which was the center of much kidding of Prien with his bad stomach . Prien himself was beyond a doorway in a final bulkhead ; his station was in the narrow wedge of the very tail of the plane . Hep176sat perched on an oversized bicycle seat , and when he was actuallyfiring he heaved his body further to the rear and kneeled on a pair of knee pads . He fired twin-fifties hung on pulleys and cables , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Farr , and switchingto VHF I heard some chatter among the command pilots of the first Schweinfurt task force , up ahead . Various ones of them were calling " Croquet " trying to get in touch with the Spits that had been supposed to rendezvous with our leading force over the Dutch coast . The fighters ' radio channel was jammed by the Germans ; the answers were unintelligible . " Sounds like the Spits did n't show , " I said to Marrow , having cut back to interphone . " We were n't supposed to have any , " he curtly said . " I mean up ahead , " I said . " All right , " Marrow said . " Let 's keep our eyes peeled . " In battle , under attack , I was supposed to be in charge of fire control and interphone discipline , though of course no one man could really be in charge because no one man could see all the sectors of possible attack ; and there was the added fact that Marrowcould not stand letting anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned a definite segment of the sky , corresponding to the zone of fire of his gun or guns , and he was supposed to cut that piece of sky into small sections in his mind and to search those sections systematically for enemy planes . Neg Handown in the top turret searched ahead and above  --  from ten o'clock to two o'clock , high ; Junior Sailen in the ball turret searched ten to two , low ; Butcher Lamb searched ( if he could tear his eyes from his book ) four to eight , high ; and Prien , in the tail , four to eight , low ; Fan , at the right waist window , searched two to four , high and low , and Bragnani , on the left , eight to ten , high and low . From time to time each man might take a look outside his sector ; Neg Handown and Junior Sailen , for instance , intermittently made. **30;873;TOOLONG sweeps with their turrets . The officers , having other duties , were not assigned definite sectors to watch , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . ' When a man sighted an enemy fighter in his sector , he was supposed to call it in at once , and generally speaking I was supposed to co-ordinate our firing , but in practice Buzz often jumped in ahead of me , and in the heat of action the gunners often called directly to each other , the man who sighted a fighter in his sector alerting another who was apt to get a good crack at the attacker as he passed . The greatestmenace to our efficiency was everyone 's talking at once , and here I was supposed to ride herd ; though , again , Marrow could n't keep his big mouth shut for long . Since our mutual safety was at stake in all this , no one stood on ceremony . We were eager to help each other and were not jealous for rank or duty , and occasionally , singing out at the sight of the enemy , calling back and forth to save our skins , we had ( or at least I know I did , and I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crewmates , so that we who were so diverse , gentle Sailen , thug-like Farr , tidy and compulsiveHaverstraw , cold-fish Prien , and the others , all of us , who got along rather badly as human beings , some of us bearing deep hatreds for others  --  all were drawn together under attack by what , for most of us , was the second strongest love on earth , second only to self-love : the love of those upon whom our lives depended . Now , passing beyond the coastline , our searching began in earnest . All we had seen up to this point had been a few black puffs of flak  --  the erratic , inaccurate anti-aircraft firing we always seemed to catch at the rim of Europe , where the batteries either had had insufficient alert or were not of the quality of those ringingmany of our targets . At any moment enemy fighters might come up . We had no way of knowing to what extent , if at all , the Regensburg strike had disorganized or exhausted the German defenses . Nor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they held back and concentrated on trying to break up our bombing runs on targets , while on other days they began to ride us a few minutes beyond the coast . " Anybody see anything ? " I said . " I see the sun and the moon , " Negrocus Handown said.  |p178As  I searched , as I monitored the bands of sound and scanned the dials in front of me , I was trying also to work out in my mind whether what Daphne had told me the day before about Marrow was as much a revelation as it had seemed at the time of her telling . It had come to me that I had dimly seen the real Marrow all along , that I must have , and now I was trying to place a turning point , if there had been one , in my attitude toward him . I realized that such a turning point , if there had been one , had come not from anything Marrow did that was new in him but rather from a growth in me , an enlargement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had helped me to achieve , along with Kid Lynch ; this must have come some time in June , about halfway through our tour , before Marrow became a hero . I now had glimpses of him in that period : at the throttle of that railway engine rolling to a stop in King 's Cross Station , his ugly face creased with his delight over our amazement at him ; his homicidal eye as he roared his disapproval of John L. Lewis in a London bar , and his sentimental expression standing in the reviewformation listening to the vainglorious Senator Tamalty rant about " the blood of arr Amarrcan boys " ; the clench of his jaw during that split-second nightmare thundering up the alley of noble beeches leading to Pike Rilling Hall at a hundred and seventymiles an hour , when Buzz took his pass at Them ; his tendernesswith his pet dog ; the tumbling of his wit , and his happy grimaces , at that squadron party at Lady Minsdale 's castle ; furious expressions on his face on several occasions  --  when he found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage missing , and when he got the news of Wheatley Bins ' having been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross , and when he started that near riot between the active pilots and the Happy Warriors , the men who had completed their tours and were hanging around , dangerously idle , waiting for new orders ; the telltale hesitancy of his head and hand as he turned The Body toward the act of courage ( so it was considered ) that made him a hero among us . I saw him as shrewd , adaptable , moody ; a natural aviator ; bellicose and noisy ; growing wiser and more exhausted , like all of us . But didp179I see deeper , and more ? In retrospect I thought I could mark the gradual change in him , and I knew I could follow the gradual change in myself . At some point the two curves must have crossed , and at that point , it seemed to me , my attitude toward Buzz must have changed . On VHF I heard Colonel Ewing , the commander of the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dropping altitude two thousand . Repeat , dropping altitude two thousand . " So we were going under the cloud cover . I indicated this to Marrow with a gesture . " The son of a bitch , " he said . " What gives ? " Handown asked , his curiosity aroused by Marrow'scurse . " Mind your beeswax , sonny , " Marrow said . Then apparentlyhe relented , for he added , " Colonel Chicken S  --  is going to tuck us under that cloud . " " That 's ducky , " Handown said ; he understood the dangers in going close under the cirrus . I supposed that my getting to know Kid Lynch had been the turning point  --  the unself-conscious prattler , so naive and unformed ; yet serious , too , always groping , between wisecracks , for some reason for all this we were doing . He provided the foil to Marrow that I guess I had needed . But of course it was Daphne who had brought me to the stage of needing a dose of Lynch 's curious blend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had never had it so good . It was Daphne who had opened my eyes , had made me love my life and want some purpose for it . I remembered sitting on the ground , one June afternoon , under the huge elms of the Backs across from King 's and Clare in Cambridge , while a cluster of students spiced the bland air of a good day with bouncing madrigals . " You call that music ? " Marrow said . He got the giggles , like a child . But I remembered Daphne 's calm . She looked at me and filled me with it . We were sitting near the Clare bridge , whose pale gray stone seemed alive in the moving , dappled shadows , and the slow Cam reflected the bridge and the sky , and I leaned close to Daphne and saw the delicate down on her cheek and the sweep of shining light-brown hair back over her ear . She was leaning back on her elbows , and I saw her breast pressing the soft cloth of her dress ,  |p180and  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life force stirringand swelling , I had very strongly a curious yearning  --  for idealism . My physical want soon drowned that out , but I remembered it . The singers stood on the far bank of the stream , young men frowning as they opened the wet caverns of their mouths and reached for high notes , then ducked their heads to the low ; and beyond them was the silvered rectilinear repose of the Clare courtyard , and beside it , as if Clare had been built to set it off , the breathtaking note of optimism , hope , and yes , stolid idealism of King 's Chapel , which Daphne had told me was the most beautifulbuilding in England , and I believed her . Then that yearning , which was a kind of dissatisfaction , passed , and I wanted to be alone with Daphne , I wanted to hold her  --  she had a way of turning her head on the pillow , looking at me each time as if she had never seen my true value before  --  and I glanced at my watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at four o'clock low ... and crackling . Marrow was bolt upright , gesticulating . He was craning over toward my side , and I started up . Earphones , it had been in my earphones . Four o'clock . I turned my head around as far as I could to the right and looked downward and saw them . The yellow upsniffingnoses . Farr came up on interphone , " Sweet Jesus ! Here they come . " Marrow was pounding my left arm . I slowly pivoted back toward my pilot and raised my gloved hands as fists , then stretched out my fingers , then clenched again , then stretched : ten , twenty . There seemed to be about twenty . And off there to the right , on a level with the bombers , well out of range , was their guide plane , the one we called Coach , throttledback and idling along like a fox terrier at the same speed as the Forts . And lower down , there they came ! They were swingingout in a wide , climbing arc , to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a kind of dumping point where they would break off to come in at us . They liked to come from the sun . They were flying smart formation . How beautiful the day was ! The school of yellow-heads swam up in a long curve , and beneath them the peaceful farmland spread out and out to a place where , in thin haze and smoke , earth gave way to sky , not so much with a horizon as with a kind of emptiness , or uncertainty , and now thep181school of enemy planes was crossing that indefinite zone in the line of my sight . They flew much faster than Forts , and their angle of climb was astounding . While still struck by the beauty of what I saw , I felt my heart begin to hurry . For a moment , in a corner of my mind , I saw a flicker of a picture  --  reclining on the bank of the Cam near the bridge , Daphne stirred , turned toward me , so the far breast rose and moved and the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students in full outcry . I wanted her ; my heart was pounding . On the interphone Marrow began to shout reminders . For a moment he was like his old self on the early missions , meddlesome yet keen , quick , happy  --  only now did I know how grotesquely happy . " All right ! Let 's not forget they might split ass and pull up ahead of us , or either push on under and loop back up for a traverse shot from under . So Junior , you be ready to open the second they get under , if they go under . Max , you be ready to tell us soon as they break . Say , Down , ' or , Up , ' whichever . And Boman , I want you to watch the .. . " Boman , it was always Boman . Nicknames for the others . And Daphne wanted me , too . Her melting eyes , cloud-pale eyelids . What was it Marrow had wanted me to watch ? I realized I had n't listened at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising against the blue , now , abeam , a close march of them , twenty or thirty planes . Now and then a whole cluster of the fighters ' props would catch the sun just right , and there would be a sudden constellation of silvery yellow-centeredroundels ; then the shining shields would fade . I recoiled as a shout rattled in my earphone . It was Marrow , upon catching his first view of the enemy procession off to the right . " Hot spit ! " Slowly I turned my head and looked at my pilot . Behind the flat glass parabolas of Marrow 's goggles I saw a frightful sight : the green pupils of his eyes completely surrounded by porcelain laced with lightning-shaped veins . The eyes of cattle with the lids pulled back , unripe grapes being forced out of thin skins ; the eyeballsmight pop right out and splatter against the glass.  |p182Almost  choking in a resurgence of my rage against Marrow , I tore my eyes , with a convulsion of my will , from Marrow 's eyes and looked at dials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in . " In the phones it was Colonel Ewing , commander of the attack , in the lead plane , wanting to get the poisonous bristles of the huge formation as compact as possible . I did not need to relay the word . Colonel Bins ahead of us was already chopping the speed down so the long files behind could push in closer , and Marrow , responding automatically , had eased the throttles back ever so slightly . I looked out at the Germans . Their small swarm was up at ten o'clock and perhaps five hundred feet above the level of the Forts . It would be only a matter of seconds now . I tried not to let go of the memory of Daphne in the shifting filtered sunlight . Her dress was pale yellow . Why did I cling to the memory of desire , when I could have thought of a passage of fulfillment ? Deepest peace of all .. . I started to hum a tune that I guess I considered protective , a kind of armor-plate spell I had often used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Nothing in This World , the way I 'd heard Kenny Sargent treat it once with the Casa Loma band , slow , souped up . I 'd make a string of pearls out of the dew . . . Over the highways and over the seas . . . It had come to me once , for some reason , on a raid , as the music of safety , magic music that would keep me out of trouble . Marrow was shouting something ; I did n't get it . I looked up into the sky ahead . Suddenly four Germanplanes skidded up and over out of the chunky parade in a beautiful simultaneous peel , and in no time they were coming down four abreast . Then Marrow began his customary war whoop at the first joining , a guttural scream , not words at all , a howl of defiance of death and delight in killing , a kind of primitive elated expulsion of a chestful of breath of a spear-thrower , and I hummed as loud as I could , because the vibration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears somewhat and helped me not to hear that familiar nightmare shriek of Marrow 's . I gripped my knees . I had for an instant a feeling that everything had stopped  --  the Fort , the oncoming fighters , my heart , my humming , our war ; only the scream persisted.  |p183Enough  of us to fill two ordinary locals horsed around on the platform of the tiny railroad station at Bartleck , with three days ahead of assured life , and of freedom from being bulldozed by Them . It was May twenty-second and fine . Our crew stuck together . The station was a wrinkled wooden building which put me in mind of the Toonerville trolley in the funnies of my childhood , and under its wide eaves on a notice board was an advice of change of fare , thenceforth to London the first-class tariff rising to ten and threepence , with a faded date underneath , of my thirteenthyear . The fare was still the same . The platform was raised and fenced and it swayed under our stamping feet . More men were arriving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ragged sweater who took sixpence to keep the wheels in a stall was growingmuddled and had begun to whine at the fellows ' crude jokes with her . A narrow , curving alley came up a slope to the station , and across from the city-bound platform two ancient men , twisted like old storm-broken willow trees , were unloading lumber from a dilapidated lorry ; the planks must have been heavy for them , and Benny Chong said , " What say we help the old goats ? " The two toothless grandpas never knew what happened to them . There was a rush of perhaps thirty of us Yank fliers , and ap184lot of whooping and clattering ensued , and in a jiffy the whole load was neatly stacked at the side of the street . It surprised me to see that Marrow had not joined us , and when we got back to the platform he said , " You do-gooders really got those old f  --  ers confused . They planned to spend all day unloadingthat crap . Look at ' em . Never pays to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you . " The old men were puttering around the tidy stack . They would lift a plank , and put it down just where it had been , and look testily across at us , and lift another plank , and put it down . They went round and round the stack with little senile steps , wringing their palsied hands . " Come on , Haverstraw , " Marrow said , " let 's have a catch . " There was a chipped and rusted enamel cup for thirsty wayfarershanging from a tap against the station wall , and Marrow grabbed it and pegged it to Clint , and then Buzz ripped one of the half-rotten pales off the platform fence , and assuming a batter'sstance he called , " Come on , son , see if you can get it over . " I-laverstraw threw the cup . Marrow swung and missed , and derisive shouts went up  --  shouts , I believed , with such an edge to them of vindictive glee over my loud pilot 's having whiffed that I felt a bristling defensive anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a big caricatured windup and threw it again , and this time Marrow connected , and the picket dustily broke , and the bottom fell out of the cup , and everyone , including Buzz , laughed . Then the train came in , a tiny soprano engine with two cylindrical bumpers like " a nice pair of boopers , " as Marrow said , pulling a line of old-fashioned four-wheeled cars along whose sides ran rows of metal-handled doors . Marrow latched onto one of the handles , and he shouted , " My crew rides first class , by Jesus , " and he brushed all corners aside , and he shouted , " Come on , Boman , drag your ass over here . Haverstraw ! Farr ! Come on , get the lead out of your pants . " The ten of us pried ourselves into the compartment along with an elderly dominie in a backwards collar who had already been sitting inside by the window , facing forward . Marrow , seating himself opposite the preacher , was subdued into a Sunday-school docility by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man while the rest of us silently stared out the window at fields ofp185turnips and wheat and rye , and at hoardings in praise of Bovril and Bile Beans , and at the towns along the way  --  Royston , Hitchin , Knebworth . Marrow and the curate got friendly over Marrow 's appalling lies about our life , and I noticed that my pilot had the gall to eat half of the old boy 's picnic lunch . " Just did it to please him , " Buzz said later . I shook the rest of them at King 's Cross Station and headed for Leicester Square Underground , where I had a date to meet Daphne at ten o'clock . She was there ahead of me , by the news kiosk where we had said we 'd rendezvous , and at the sight of her I took a deep breath and felt as if I were diving into a cool pond of peace . We decided to ride around , having nothing but time to kill , and we mounted the stairs of a shiny red double-decker bus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I were seeing London for the first time  --  a beleaguered place long after the worst of the siege , with vast stretches of barbed wire and barriers of cheveaux-de-frise and pillboxes with menacing black gun slits , and boarded-up houses , and sandbag walls with the burlap rotting and weeds growing out of the sand , and Anderson shelters , and signs pointing to refuge in the tubes , whose stations were still lined with tripledeckerbunks . We passed a troop of soldiers singing as they marched , and I reckoned myself fairly cynical by then , but those full throats and jaunty exaggerated hand swings made my scalp tingle , and I held Daphne 's hand , thinking of her father killed in a night raid . We had hardly touched each other since that first night I 'd gone out with her in Cambridge , and when she squeezed my arm between hers and her side , I had a flood of ideas . " Would you like to go up the Thames ? " she said . " It 's such a wizard day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " I 'll go , but do n't rush me . " I wanted a big stretch-out ; I wanted the day to drag . I wanted to be with Daphne for a long , long time . " Let 's take a look at Big Ben , " I said . " A clock that big ought to have real enormous hours . " So we did , but I could see the minute hand moving , and I said , " Uhn-uhn , baby , that clock gives me the heebie-jeebies. "  |p186We  went to a dock where there was a big flat steam barge with an awning and seats like park benches , and I thought I 'd bust a gut when I said through the purser 's grille , " Two tickets for Maidenhead , " with Daph poking me in the ribs . It was Saturday , and sunny , and mobs were out on the river . The only thing that spoiled the day was uniforms  --  Britishers , Canadians , Australians , Poles , Czechs , Frenchmen , Belgians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was dirty , but under the open sky it tried its best to be blue . The river diminished and became just a stream , narrower than the Shaushohobogen at Donkentown . It was hard to take that in , because the whole world had heard of the Thames , and a couple of my own crewmates did n't believe , to that day , that there was a grand , wide watercoursein the U.S.A. called the Shaushohobogen . The barge docked , and the passengers filed ashore , and Daphne and I sat on the grass in a kind of park beside the riverand watched the boating parties , some in small launches which I glided silently along , propelled by storage batteries . " Petrol shortage , " Daphne explained . I thought of Marrow joy-riding in a B-i7 with three nurses , and I estimated that he 'd burned enough gasolineon that self-indulgent mission to keep boating parties going at Maidenhead till the war was squeezed into history books . Waste . I thought of the rows and rows of garbage cans , outside our messes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunks of meat and jillions of slices of perfectly good white bread . " Hungry , Daph ? " She gave me that melted-eye look and said , " For you . " For the second time in my life I lay down and put my head in Daphne 's lap , but this time I did n't sleep . She stroked my temple and sang old music-hall songs in a furry , droopy voice . It is not surprising that my foremost memory of that hour  --  and it was an hour that I called up often for review in the subsequentweeks  --  was of the absolute peace of lying on my back , looking up at Daphne 's bosom and at the underside of her face as she dreamily stared out across the river , and concentrating my entirebeing into the few square inches of my skin that Daphne 's finger tips caressed . Thinking back more painstakingly , however , I realize that during that time we talked quite a lot about Marrow.  |p187To  begin with , I said , " Daph , do you remember I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lorient raid  --  I mean , that you can always get out of a Fort ? Well , I lost another , going to Kiel the other clay . " Daphne 's fingers seemed to hesitate ; I think perhaps there was a delicate tremor in them . " What this time ? " she asked . " That nothing can happen to Marrow 's ship . I wanted to believe it . Seemed better than having insurance to believe it . But I got shed of that idea . " I told her the story . " I 'm afraid that mission did n't do much to win the war , or to reflect credit , as your military chaps say , to our branch of arms . I do n't know , it seemed to have a deliberate plan of chaos and error about it . They got us up at two forty-five , but there was a bad ground haze , and we had two postponements , and by ten o'clock we were so sure the strike would be scrubbed that we were mentally relaxed and let down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen , in the wrong frame of mind . " There was a period of about ninety seconds on the bombing run , Daph  --  it was just a distillation of confusion . There was a heavy smoke screen around the target , and nobody up ahead seemed to know where the aiming point was , and a formation of twin-engine German fighters was in the act of bombing us from twenty-seven thousand feet , and about forty single-engine jobs were coming in , head on , at our level , and you could have walked on the flak . Any jerk could have told that the lead group was so far off its course that it could n't have bombed accurately without a **26;905;TOOLONG turn , but it let go anyway . Listen . We later learned that not a single bomb of the five attacking groups landed within four thousand feet of the aiming point ; in other words , the bomb closest to the target was four fifths of a mile away from it . " But let me tell you , darling , some brilliant lug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little surprise for us . " The group going in on the target immediately ahead of us , and higher than we  --  they 'd been loaded with a considerable quantityof five-hundred-pound clusters of incendiary bombs , and when they toggled , a lot of the clusters opened at once , and the individualincendiaries  --  each one was fused to splash flame on anything it touched at the instant of contact  --  these things floated slowly down directly in our path . Marrow really has remarkable reflexes ; he saw this and he knew in a flash what had happened , and what might happen , and he took evasive action as if his finger had touched a hot stove . " The trouble was , some other pilots in our Group were alert , too , and they dodged , every which way , and wham ! We hit prop wash . " The Body wung up onto her right ear , and I was sure we were going into a spin . Handown , who 'd been operating the upper turret , came sprawling down out of it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . . . . " I closed my eyes . It made me dizzy even to think of those moments . Being in prop wash is like being in the water in the wake of a ship ; the turbulencehas an elemental ferocity , and in the air only the long fang of a tornadic squall can match it . " I could n't have told which end was up , tail or teakettle . But Marrow righted us within seconds  --  only the prop wash had thrown us right into the mess of incendiaries ; they were as thick as a flock of starlings . " I heard Marrow holler to Max Brindt to toggle , and I guess Max whacked his bomb-release handle  --  and that was our ship 's contribution that day to what is known as high-level precision , or pin-point , bombing . Rather large pickle barrel . " Anyway , I looked out the right-hand window and saw a flame going like a big match-head on the leading edge of the wing close against the nacelle of number three . " I rapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time Marrow had stretched his neck enough to look out my side there was a nasty streak of black smoke pouring out behind the number-three engine . I had one thought : Braddock . Otherwise I was blank . " Somehow Handown had got on his feet and was plugged in on interphone , and he growled at me , Cowl flaps . '  | " But Marrow said , ' No , wait a minute . ' He wanted to run the r.p.m. up on that engine first , to see if he could blow the fire out . At the same time , incidentally , he was pouring on the coal to catch up and hook back onto the formation , because if there 's anything lonely in this world it 's a straggler just after the bombing run . He really was on the ball . I was really impressed by his presence of mind , and Handown 's , too . I could n't have scratched fleas , myself , at that moment . " Nothing happened when Buzz ran up the engine , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaps : that 's like closing the damper on a stove . I was really just reacting to Neg 's growl . I saw Marrow close the fuel shut-off valve to number three , so as not to feed the fire . But though the smoke thinned out , it persisted . " My heart , Daph , it seemed to be going with a double thump : Braddock Braddock Braddock Braddock Braddock . " Handown said , ' Set your fire-extinguisher selector valve . ' " I was gazing at the smoke , you know , like somebody puzzling out the flames of a fireplace fire on a winter evening . " Handown kind of sang , ' Lieutenant Bo-o-oman . ' " At that his message about the selector got through to me , and I jumped to it , feeling like a jackass . " ' All right , ' Marrow said , ' pull the God-damn charge . ' " I pulled it . The fire went out . I felt as if I 'd done something important , as if I 'd been a resourceful fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daph . " Marrow nipped this by saying  --  and he said it as if he 'd been ordering some step of familiar routine , ' All right , let 's feather . ' " By this time I was fairly rational , and I moved the mixture control of number three , above the throttles , to engine-off , and I flicked a little bar like a metal light switch on the central control panel which cut three 's booster pump , and then I reached over belowthe bank-and-turn indicator and gave the feathering button for number three a good thorough mashing . " All this seems like nothing to tell , Daph , but to me it was impressive . My heart was going Brad-Brad-Brad-Brad , and what seemed like six billion switches and buttons and levers were bristlingall around me  --  and I reached out and eased the right lever , flipped the right switch , pushed the right button . It really was n't bad.  | " Now that the crisis was over , the fire out , the prop standing up stiff and cutting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my mind became unbelievably quick and clear . ... " I remembered it , too , with utmost clarity : For a few minutes , as I had worked with Handown , this time on my initiative , to transfer fuel from the tank of the dead engine , no extraneous thought had intruded , and in the command centers of my mind all had been swept away in favor of action and reaction . Thanks to Marrow 's steady hand , we had held our place in the formation on three engines as rigidly as if we had been attached to the Group by struts , bolts , and rivets . When we had got down to twelve thousand , Marrow peeled off his mask , and he threw a look my way that seemed to say , " Well , you jerk , you thought we were in trouble , but I got you out of it . " But I was thinking , The Body could be hit . There was nothing sacrosanct about Marrow 's ship . I wanted to puke . I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to use the relief tube , and I got unstrapped and went back in the ship . In the radio room , Butcher Lamb was pretending there was n't a war , for he had his mask off and , using a clipboard and a Form One , he was writing a letter to his mother . " What are you thinking ? " Daphne asked me . I was thinking , The Body was not inviolate after all . " Nothing , " I said . " I was just thinking that Marrow is n't magic . I really guess I 'd thought he was . " " All the same , " I said , " he 's grown in my estimation , too . " I told Daphne that his coolness in moments of stress , and his ability during those moments to keep track of many complex threads of action  --  these were truly remarkable . Whereas for me there was a dangerous gap in time , of a kind of stunned amazement , between the shock of an untoward happening and the wonderfulclarity of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case this turnover was instantaneous ; the same was apparently true for Neg Handown . I told Daph that to achieve combat efficiency I must narrow that time gap . But I realized , too , that this narrowing was not something I could accomplish as an act of will , or by autosuggestion , by repeating , as in prayer , " I 'm getting braver and braver . " " The day after the fire , " I said , " I did get a hint of how the gap could be closed , and of course I got it from Marrow . " No mission was scheduled that day , but Marrow was up early , and he went to Operations and arranged to borrow a ship , Betty Grable , since ours was on the line having her dead engine hoisted out , and he rounded up our crew , and he took us up high , so we were on oxygen , and he sounded a mock alarm  --  fire in the number-one engine ! Then he re-enacted with us everything that had happened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not once , but several times , exactly what to do if such a thing ever happenedagain . And while he was at it , he started imaginary fires in other parts of the ship , and we practiced putting them out . " This was the toughening process , which Buzz understood . The threat to his life was not a monolith called Danger ; it was a lot of bits and pieces of trouble and potential trouble , and his secret of gaining internal strength was to recognize them , and deal with them , one by one . It had dawned on me that Marrow broke off little fragments of Danger , put them in compartments , and took them out from time to time to dust them off in his mind . He evidentlymastered every possible separate minor mishap , and every possible major breakdown , too , by going over it many , many times in imagination , till his defenses were second nature . Thus there seemed to be very little about flying that was unexpected or unknown to him , and when something nasty happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind , against which cries of vague inner fear echoed ; it was rather a familiar-shaped reality , it was itself , and it stirred up in his mind other realities  --  consequences , remedies , preventions , counter-measures . I talked about all these things with Daphne , but I realized something else , too , and this I did not discuss with her  --  that in our kind of warfare one had to have an almost infinite capacity for toughness . At the beginning we had had an amazingly efficient substitute for strength  --  ignorance . On our early missions we re/acted well to danger because we could n't see it . But now , as we were learning how to atomize danger and master its fragments , we were also learning , with giddying rapidity , that there were ever new pieces of peril to be overcome : experience brought both the attritionof danger and its expansion . The race between these two was a race for our lives , and , I must say , Marrow 's intuitive grasp of the way to grow tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helped me in the end to outlast even him . I began talking then about our all too frequent inaccuracies , gross errors , what they must have meant twenty-odd thousand feet below us , when our bombs , intended for some visceral center of enemy industry , landed instead in housing . I guess I still had Daph 's poor father on the edge of my mind , and all the boarded-up windows and shells of homes we 'd seen on our bus ride that morning . I came right out and said I was getting scrupulousabout killing people . When it was Germans it was bad enough ; with Frenchmen , Belgians , Dutchmen , it was even worse . I said I 'd been brought up with moderate middle-class strictness , nothing exceptional , for my people were nice but not so nice as to be nasty  --  and I had had what had seemed to me a more or less average social self , I 'd had a sense of decency , much like that of many of our officers and enlisted men upon the inception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the standardized debasementof all values that went with an army existence , where toughnessand self-centered amorality were the popular things , and considerationfor others and any form of propriety were considered chicken s  --  , I had rather easily given up a great deal of what came under the general heading of square behavior , and I took for granted and , along with my associates , indulged freely in obscene language , drunkenness , sexual promiscuity , and a certain ruthlessnessin looking out for one 's own comforts . But there were some taboos  --  and killing was foremost among them  --  that were harder to shake , even under the persuasion of a good cause . With my corn/rades , I could live and let live ; it was not so easy , with my enemies , to live and let die . I had n't been truly persuaded , before I 'd got into the fight , that the Germans were a threat to my life or my way of life ; I 'd heard a lot of talk about the threat , and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been real to me , and it still was not  --  even after touring the wreckage of London that morning . I tried to express some of this to Daphne . " You 're lucky , " Daphne said . She had begun again the gentle movements of her hand across my face , and I guess that for a minuteI took this massage , as I had taken so many dull , badly organizedlectures of indoctrination in the Air Force , to be a deliberate lulling of my qualms , for Daphne , being English , and having lost a father and a lover to the Germans , had a vested urge to keep me in fighting trim . " How come lucky ' ? " I truculently said . " You 're not like some of the others , " she said . All of a sudden I wanted to make a little argument . " What the hell do you mean by that ? " I asked . " For some of them war 's a license , " she said . " Like a hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she said , " Exactly . Makes what they want to do legal and even respectable . " " Who 's they ' ? " " Oh , I know them , " she said . " I made the mistake of falling in love with one of them . " At that she stopped rubbing my head . " Hey ! " I said , protesting the stoppage , and the automatic fingers began to move again , and I realized that their warm friction was more important to me than all the bellyaches and gripes on earth . I gave up interest in our exchange and pressed my head against Daph 's resilient abdomen and half lost what she said next . " You ought to know one of them . " She meant Marrow , of course . So my Daphne , having already sized up my pilot , had dropped a hint about him , to which I wish I 'd paid better attention . Had I thought through what she had said , had I not been transported , put half to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Marrow whole much earlier in my tour , and I might have been spared the full force of the disappointment , shock , and revulsion to which I was treated so near the end.  |p194Time  glided along like an electric launch , and too soon we had to board our barge , and we rode downriver , and we were famished . There was supposed to be a five-shilling limit on the price of meals all over England , but Daphne knew of a place called the White Tower off Soho Square where , for a heap more than the limit , we could get some fine crackling bootleg roast mutton . ( " Nothing like beating the system , " I said . ) And afterwards , in mid-afternoon , we took a room at one of the best hotels , and when a stiff clerk asked where our luggage was , Daphne held up her purse , which was a big one with her nightgown and fixings in it , and without batting a lash the clerk said , " ' Nk yaw , " on a rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to pay in advance , because of war and allies and all that , I supposed ; perhaps he was thanking me for Lease-Lend . And I took time to think : Americans call it Lend-Lease , the English , Lease-Lend  --  a nice exercise all around in self-congratulatory self-deception . A very old porter  --  for all the young men were otherwise engaged  --  witha single key on a huge ring led us to our room . " If you please , sir , " he said , standing by the door and pointing with his elbow ( in order , I suppose , that only the gentleman would get it ) at a sliding bolt with which one could lock the door from within . At that I tipped him too much , and when he was gone I loudly shot the bolt and Daphne and I , laughing , embraced . The sack was superior . We were in it , awake most of the time , for twenty hours . Daphne had to go back to Cambridge on Sunday afternoon to be able to return to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's Cross Station and then hopped a cab to join Marrowand the gang at the Dorchester , where they had said they would be . Marrow had a room , all right , but no one answered the house phone , and I bribed an old boy to take me up and let me in , andp195no one was home , so I lay on the bed and gave myself over to the best glow I 'd ever experienced . Daphne was really mine ! When we had first approached each other , the previous afternoon , it had been with a deep shyness yet an overpowering yearning . What ensued seemed our first touching and joining , for this time Daphne truly gave herself to me , and I found that I had not been mistaken : deep in her there were surprises , storms of feeling , extraordinary furnace fires , bottomless spasms , tender places , changes , quiets . At the end she had anxiously asked me , " Do you still love me ? " I had not made any formal declarations ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was the king of the forest , and I was amazed at her question . Then she had wept . She had sobbed in my arms , and I had been stirred all through , because I understood that her tears , her wrenching , heaving sobs , stood for an enormous gift to me  --  of her whole self . I understood that something that had happened to her in the past had made her want to hold back large parts of herself ; she would allow herself , perhaps , to be more or less raped , as I had , I guess , violated her , with her acquiescence , the first time we had been together in Cambridge , but she would not dig deep and make , as the expression goes , love . But now she had done just that , and she wept out her overwhelming joy . I dried her tears with a new access of passion . All night and all morning we made new discoveries . I fell into a sleep such as I had not had since our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innermost soul ; but this healing rest was interrupted , because Marrow , half tight , came blustering in to take a shower before dinner . He got me up and recruited me for a pub crawl . It seemed that the mighty swordsman had nothing definite to do . We went out and moved from bar to bar . Marrow may have crawled ; I floated . I was high . I did n't need a drink . But I took one . And another . We lapped up wine ; tried gin ; had a Pimm 's ; found some so-called whiskey . Sang down the Mall . We tied up with some Dutch R.A.F. pilots in the Berkeley Buttery , where , through some inadvertence , we decided to have some chitterlings and champagne.  |p196After  we got talking , the Dutchmen started ripping Hitler 's stomach with vengeful hearts ( " Daph ! Daph ! "  --  I kept floating off into reveries ) , and suddenly Marrow said to those two guys : " You know whose guts I hate ? " Marrow lit into John L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , and livings to Hitler , were astounded at Marrow 's vehemence , for they did n't even know who Lewis was . Marrow started by describing Lewis ' enormous head , and the great contempt-swollenflap of his upper lip ; he gave a vivid picture of Lewis  --  and , oddly , of a physical being such as he , Marrow , might one day become : gross , aggressive , toad-like . At the end of April Lewis had taken his soft-coal miners out on strike in Alabama , Kentucky , and Pennsylvania ; he had thumbed his nose at the War Labor Board ; Roosevelt had had to seize the mines . Men were dying overseas ! Marrow 's tirade began with animal epithets : skunk , pig , horse 's ass , and it moved through scatology into demonology , until it appeared that Hitler was only a petulant , troublesome urchin and John L. Lewis was the true scourge of the earth . Really , the Dutchmen began to look cross-eyed , and I must say that I was surprised by the virulence of Marrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I wondered why . Perhaps the physical picture , or caricature , that he had drawn of Lewis was a clue , for there was surely some self in it ; perhaps Marrow 's own long battle with cold and discomfort , back in March and April , which had involvedhim in that theft of coke from the stack for the enlisted men 's showers , was preying on his mind . The Dutchmen went off shaking their heads , and pretty soon we got on the move again . In the Savoy we found Max Brindt hooked up with some fancy Army desk types in gabardine uniformswhich they 'd had made , they told us , in Savile Row . They were fighting a hard sartorial war ; had to buy new uniforms all the time to keep the seats of their pants from getting shiny . " Boman , " Marrow said while we were drinking with them , " what the f  --  has got into you ? You look like you got a snoot full of hasheesh . " I think that what bothered Buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he demanded , and usually got , close attention . I said , " Girl name of Daphne . "  |p197Marrow  said , " You gone soft in the head ? " One of the tailor 's dummies , slightly soused , said , " What 's a matter , big boy , do n't you like name Daphne ? " " Listen , Mr. Gabby Dean , " Marrow said , " I 've screwed more women than you 'll ever shake hands with in all the Embassies and all the Duchesses ' palaces you 'll ever worm your way into , but I 'm a flier ! No woman is ever going to come between me and flying . " Max , bless him , chimed in for me . " Who said Bo was going to quit flying ? " " Look at him ! " Marrow said , holding a hand up toward my face . " Captain , " the soldier said , " you sound like you ca n't stand for anyone to get onto Topic A except yourself . " This soldier-boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky high . Instead he said , benignly , " Listen , Mac , Topic A may be women in the suit-and-cloak branch of the service . In the Air Force , Topic A is flying . Topic B is s  --  , which is just another way of saying bombs , huh , Max ? Topic C is women . Right , Boman ? " He had allied himself with me , with us . Fliers against the world . We took off once more . We got around that night . At the Captain 's Cabin we wound up at a big table of Eighth Air Force staff johnnies with some Mayfair girls who were out slumming , and a funny thing happened to me . I got flirting with one of them , and I danced with her , and I felt all arrogant , and I damn near asked her to go to bed with me ; I felt sure she would . Yet all I cared about in the whole world was Daphne . It was some kind of momentumin me , I guess , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned in at the Dorchester as a saffron dawn seeped in behind the barrage balloons to the east . The last thing I heard as I dropped off to sleep was the sound of some hard-heeled British boots striking the pavement outside our window , going away , echoing , fading.  |p198I  slept some more of that innermost sleep until the middle of the following afternoon , when I got up and went out to an old-fashioned photographer 's studio and smirked like a man who has just won a war single-handedly while the widow who ran the shop ducked under a black cloth behind a big box camera , and squeezed a rubber ball , and I paid for the picture , sight unseen , and told the lady to send one copy to Daphne 's address and one to my mother 's . Our whole crew rendezvoused at King 's Cross to catch a train out to the base . As we were waiting , a cocky littly shunting engine kept puffing back and forth , and when it started up once , Marrow jumped aboard , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too fast . " Runway ai n't long enough to take that thing off , " Handown said . Our train time approached . We began to worry about our pilot . About fifteen minutes passed . Then in came a crack express from the north , the Scottish Queen , or something like that , and the majestic black and red engine came to a stop and exhaled , with a contented cloudy hiss . A huge head , topped by a coal-dusty Englishengineer 's cap , poked out the cab window , the ugly mug split by a magnificent grin  --  Marrow 's , of course . Behind him in the cab we saw a dignified elderly English railroader in an Air Force cap with the wire ring taken out . Marrow never would tell us how he had managed it.  |p199On  the train on the way out to Pike Rilling ( Marrow still in his new hat ) we learned that during the leave Handown had attempted the worldly education of Junior Sailen , had procured for the tiny man a tiny woman and had rented for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny house , but at the last moment , as Handown was offering instructions for the tiny operation that was to ensue , Junior had put on a demonstration of unexpected spirit and had thrown Neg the hell out . It further developed that after bolting the door the ungrateful little bastard had poked some toilet paper into the tiny keyhole . " How was it , Junior ? " Marrow asked . " Big , " said Junior , grinning in a fairly good imitation of his pilot . Back at the base , as we checked in , we took a lazy look at the C.O. 's bulletin board , and we saw a notice which read : " The intensity of operations has permitted an accumulation of various kinds of trash , waste paper , scrap lumber , and other debris on variousparts of the airdome . Commanding officers of all units at Pike Rilling are warned that they will be personally responsible for the cleanliness of the areas they control . " Immediately under that information was another typed page : " A deplorable laxness in discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station . All personnel are advised to improve their personal appearance and to adopt a more soldierly standard of behavior . All officers and enlisted men will observe the ritual of the salute with the greatest possible precision and propriety . " " The Colonel 's cracking up , " Marrow said . He meant Whelan , the Group C.O. " S  --  , " Haverstraw said , " that 's just to depress us in case we had a good time on our leaves . "  |p200But  Marrow was dead serious . " No , " he said , " you watch . He 's off his chump . Any fighting man who gets the regulation book on the brain "  --  and Buzz kissed his finger tips and threw the kiss away . For the next two days we were breaking off salutes as if they were wooden laths . After that we returned to normal . Having checked in I went to our room and had an hour alone there , because Marrow felt compelled , I guess , to go to the officers ' club and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metropolitan womankind during the long stand-down . I thought I wanted to think about Daphne , but when I got to the hut and tossed myself on my bed , I found that all I wanted was to savor the familiarity of my room . The stove . The muslin blackout curtains , faded from black , in places , to yellow-green-gray by sun and dampness . The acrid smell of dirty Army blankets . Every detailof it was familiar to me . This was my home . I closed my eyes and visualized the contents of my metal locker , the crammed , rather orderly array  --  a place for everything and everything , if not in its place , at least accounted for . In time I was thinking about Marrow  --  the inanimate Marrow scattered around our room , disorderly , positive , maddening , distinctive . I despised and admired his sloppiness . He parked his towels , wet or dry , under his bed . He raided my locker often for socks or handkerchiefs just because he was too lazy to dig deep enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would surely be there . He had the upper half of a human skull  --  said it was a woman 's  --  on the desk for an ash tray , and it always brimmed with cylinders of cigar ash . His eight-dollar pillow . Stringless ukulele . Pin-ups neatly covered with transparent talc : Danielle Darrieux , within reach ; Paulette Goddard , twisting rear view , about to take everything off ; Eleanor Holm , demonstrating her flotation mechanisms in a racing suit ; Betty Grable ( " She is able , " Marrow always said ) ; Simone Simon , leaning dizzy-makingly forward . ( " How do you suppose shep201squeezes that e in between those two See-moans ? " ) One Varga . One Petty . Only one nude  --  picture of a dame , said to be a starlet , named Carmen Lundquist . Swedish tits , Spanish ass , Marrow said . Strictly his . For a while he had a laundry shirt-cardboard hinged over Lundquist , so that he , and only he , could lift the flap and look at her when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second day after we arrived in England , and finding Marrow at work nailing up these pictures . Where had he acquired them ? He had n't had them during training , or in the phases . . . . On the desk there was a precariously balanced pile of Marrownesses : four cans of shoe impregnate  --  stuff we 'd lugged halfway across the world to protect our feet against poisonous gases  --  which Marrow had found to be even better kindling than shoe polish for English so-called stoves ; one pair drop-seat long underwear in readiness to take along when joy-riding nurses because ( according to him ) one of the three on his early joy ride damn near came down with frostbiteof the nates ; fire-fighting bucket of sand used as ash receptacle and cigar-butt douser ; comic books and back issues of Stars and Stripes and Yank , not for perusal but for starting fires , wiping up spilled beer , and swatting the bees that kept getting in . The Tannoy crackled outside , and I half sat up , then let myselfdown again when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself Kid Lynch . " Now hear this , " the voice said , Navy-style . " Footnote on morale : " Those that I fight I do not hate . Those that I guard I do not love . . Nor law , nor duty bade me fight , Nor public men , nor cheering crowds . A lonely impulse of delightDrove to this tumult in the clouds . " He signed off : " Lieutenant Lynch reporting . " Those lines gave me a funny feeling ; for some reason I thought of my mother . Lynch did n't write those words , I thought ; his stuff was doggerel . I dropped off to sleep in my clothes and slept right through till ten the next morning , something like sixteen hours.  |p202An  irony : Having some point to my life made my days seem intolerable . I became bored , impatient , jumpy ; wanted to fly and hated flying . On the afternoon after my long sleep there was a shake-up in squadron commanders , because two of the three in the Group had completed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the squadrons , and one of Marrow 's friends , Curly Jonas , was made Operations Officer of the Group . When these and some other promotions had been posted , Marrow went around with more than his usual swagger and bounce , but I sensed that he was feeling badly slighted , and indeed I myself felt hurt on his behalf . How could he have been passed over ? New evidence that Colonel Whelan was off his trolley . Anyone with any gray matter knew that Marrow was the best flier of the bunch . That evening in the enlisted men 's mess some civilian , a real sharpie , gave us an exhibition of card tricks , magic , and sleight-ofhand , but with a new twist : He showed us how the tricks were done . He explained " strippers "  --  decks of cards shaved to a very slight wedge shape for certain effects ; other decks with tiny bits of ends off certain cards . Very slowly , so that the eye was faster than the hand for a change , he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how easy it was for experts to fool suckers . Coming out afterwards , the padre , Major Plate , a bald , heavy-bearded man who had been a saxophone player in a jazz combination before he got the call , happened to be alongside Buzz and me , and he said , trying to be a funny joe , " Anybody for a couple rounds of poker ? " Marrow , who prided himself on his poker winnings , who was indeed famous in the Group as a steady winner , tugged me by the sleeve to slow me down ; the chaplain walked on . Marrow was burned up . " That bastard padre , " he whispered . " He must think I cheat on ' cm . God damn it , I 'm shot full of luck . "  |p203The  following day , May twenty-sixth , the weather was perfect , but we were stood down . The worst of it was that there was no advance notice of the free day ; we did n't get the word until ten in the morning , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an announcement the night before would have given me a chance to arrange seeing Daphne . The whole station was on edge , and the core of the restlessness was the band of thirty-odd men who in recent days had completed their tours , the Happy Warriors , so-called , only they were n't warriors any more and they certainly were n't happy . I watched the try-outs for the Group ball team in the afternoon , and Marrow was shouting so raucously , so childishly , for Clint I-Iaverstraw that Clint was almost cut off the squad , but Clint 's natural talent for scooping up grounders finally won out over the coach 's exasperation at Marrow 's rasping voice , and Clint was picked for the first club . You 'd have thought Marrowpreferred this choice to his own promotion to Squadron C.O. I felt stale and half nutty , and I was conscious of Marrow 's having made a spectacle of himself , and I decided to take a bike ride alone . It was already nearly six o'clock . I followed the perimeter track around to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sky had a silken texture , the pale color of certainoff-white hollyhocks we had had in Donkentown . ' Warm sunlightlit the hedges and fields of crops . I was fed to the teeth with everything . I rode back and threw myself onto my spine in one of the beer-smelling leather chairs in the officers ' club and listened to Frances Langford and Ginny Sims and Connie Boswell on an American Forces Network program , and that just made me want to break up the place . So I called Daphne at her lodgings , and I said , " Baby , you 've got to rig up some emergency yarn so we can get together when they spring a last-minute stand-down on us . " " I 'll think of something , Bo , " she said . I did n't sleep a wink that night , and they gave us a tedious Group practice mission next morning , to break in some replacements . And when we got back down there was this notice thatp204Loony Whelan had posted . Bicycle regulations . Lights after dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then wham ! No individual to ride bicycle more than fifteen miles from the station . That put Cambridge out of bounds . I went straight to a booth and called Daph at her office : " Listen , Daph , " I said , " first chance I get I 'm going to rent a room in Motford Sage . " So she and I could have some privacy once in a while . Easy bike distance from the base . She could bus it . " That sounds wizard , darling , " she said . My boiler pressure was getting mighty high . Marrow came rushing into the room . Panting , he told me they 'd announced a blanket invitation to officers of our Group from a certain Lady Minsdale , who had a big country place the other side of Bartleck , to come to a joint R.A.F.-U.S.A.A.F. tea party that afternoon . Marrow talked me into going with him . He said this Lady Minsdale was probably a dark-eyed nymphomaniac like lots of British noblewomen whose husbands were in the desert , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainthe troops . There would be sherry  --  famous aphrodisiac used by English lady enthusiasts . I was so knocked out I went . We rode in a convoy of weapons carriers , about forty horny fliers and I with Daph on my mind . Snaking up Lady M. 's long driveway we saw a troop of the Home Guard , the sorriest collection of lopchicks and wheelchair reprieves you ever saw , out for their Thursday tactical problem , on a stalk across Lady M. 's magnificent lawns after imaginaryHuns with a lot of rabbit guns and crow irons . Truly it was very touching , but our fliers laughed at the old boys and yoohooedas if those earnest defenders of the realm were a gaggle of high-school girls . When we got to the house it turned out that Lady M. was seventy-three , and that she had a sister sixty-nine . " That one 's the nympho , Buzz , " I said , and he gave me a sock on the upper arm . Not a single girl had been invited , just a lot of chaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice old duck/ies treated us like schoolboys . Games we had . Tug of war . Lady M. and sister Agatha sat nine limeys and nine Yanks in two rows facing each other on the polished parquet , each man with his legs spread holding the one in front of him around the belly , the lead man in each line holding one end of a mop handle , then at a cry from Agatha the two lines began to tug , the men inching and squirming and straining backwards on their behinds , grunting , yelling like wahoos . The R.A.F. won once ; our team , with Marrow holding , won once . There was a treasure , hunt . Then the R.A.F. fellows introduced a game called , " Are You There , Moriarty ? , " played by two blind-folded men on their knees , each grasping the other by the left hand and holding in his right a rolled-up magazinefor a cudgel , the purpose being to outguess the opponent 's evasive maneuvers and blam him on the head . The dear old girls shrewdly saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We snatched and gulped like wolves . Toward the end , Lady M. stood in a chair and in a sweet , fruity voice said , " I find I have just one biscuit left . What shall I do ? Which of you nice officers can tell me what to do with this one last biscuit ? " Marrow spoke up in a marvelous imitation of Old Man Whelan on his severe note . " First man , " he said , " who tells the lady what she can do with the biscuit gets thirty days in the guard-house . " The next day Marrow was away down in the dumps . They had alerted us for a mission to the ship-building installations at Bremen , and Sully wakened us at two thirty in the morning , and we went through all the preparations , and then they scrubbed us , and of course we were sore as cats in the rain , and we went back to our sacks . In mid-afternoon they mustered all the crews over in front of the Admin building for a lecture by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Colonel was losing his mind  --  on security , not talking while intoxicated , not giving brief/ings to Piccadilly commandos , but the thing I remembered of that assembly was being conscious of Lynch , on account of the bogus crew he had set up for Stormy Peters . At the last moment , just as the roll was about to be called , Stormy and Doc Randall and some of the S-a boys came tumbling out of the building , all in a heap , and formed up with us a crew ; their mythical plane had been named the Blue-Ass Baboon a few days before , and Lynch had gotten Chan Charles to make a drawingof a monstrous ship , half airplane , half ape , and he had had postcard-sized photographs made of the drawing and had put them up among the recognition silhouettes and drawings in various offices all over the base . A ribald folklore was growing up around the Blue-Ass Baboon , and we all knew that Lynch was the instigatorof most of it . After we had been dismissed I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut me off really with a snarl . I rode my bike to Motford Sage and rented a room . It was easy to do . I inquired of the bartender at the Blue Anchor about rooming houses in the town , and he asked some townsmen who were having late afternoon beers , and they told me of a Mrs. Porlock , on Stanley Crescent ; this turned out to be a curving street of stucco houses behind stucco walls at the edge of town , a pathetic caricature of London pretentiousness , and Mrs. P. was a fat , stoical woman who , having been cleaned out of a husband and four sons ( two men drowned on the Repulse , one dead in the desert , one killed at Narvik , one missing at Dunkirk ) , had nothing but room and memories , and for a weekly stipend that was less than the price of a steak and French fries in Donkentown she let me have an upstairsback room , with substantial privacy , that had been shared by two of her boys  --  still contained their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleated soccer shoes , a box of spanners , a drawer full of marbles , cheap lead soldiers , a brass gyroscope , a wooden foot-rule , treasures of Mrs. Porlock 's heart , whichp207she took out for me , one by one . She understood perfectly the situation . She asked me , " Will she be livin ' in constant , or inter-mittent ? " When I got back to the station , after dark , Marrow was tight and surly , and an alert was announced , and he said , " Come on and walk me , Boman . I got to sober up . " We struck out along the perimeter track under a quarter moon , and Marrow said in a disgusted tone , " I want to go to that God-damn track where they 're trying to grow yellow corn . " We walked to the station agricultural project , and we saw that in the English drizzle and mugginess the corn , ten thousand stalks of which had been transplanted out in recent days , had poorly started , and only came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this made Marrow , a Nebraska cornland boy , absolutely furious . " Muddle-headed bastards ! " he shouted , and before I could stop him he was wildly running directly down the rows , kicking and trampling the tiny stalks . He had destroyed nearly three rows ' worth of those seedlings before I could catch up and throw him down with a football tackle . " Crazy f  --  ing Whelan idiot , " he was shouting , and he seemed to be whimpering , as he lay on the ground , and he said once , " They should 've known there would n't be enough sun , " and another time , " What ever made them think that Bins can fly an airplane ? " Poor guy . Drunk as a coot . I was sorry for him . Riding out to the ship in a weapons carrier on May twenty-ninth , we had a brand-new crew with us , and it might have been a college football team just before the first game of the season . The boys were chatty , eager , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How innocent they are ! I was going on my ninth raid . On the whole the crews were happy , for the briefing had n't been until eight thirty , and the take-off was to be at five minutes to two in the afternoon . We in The Body worked up some appre/hension about flak before the take-off , discussing that day 's innovation  --  forour formations were to be joined that afternoon for the first time by a handful of YB-40s , Forts that had been converted from bombers to super-fighters by the addition of five extra fiftycaliberguns and some armor plate around the engines . These air destroyers were supposed to beef us up defensively . The only troublewas that their extra weight made them slow , and to keep them socked in we could only go at an indicated air speed of one hundred and fifty  --  and this , good old number-brained Haverstraw had remarked , would make the problem of the German anti-aircrafttrackers simpler than usual . Furthermore , St. Nazaire was known as " Flak City , " for the Germans had brought more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's submarine installations around with them , and their crews were obviously superior gunners . On top of all this , we saw , as we approached the initial point , that the Hcinies had a JU-88 sitting up over St. Nazaire as a flak observer . On the bombing run I think every one of us on the ship , with the exception of Max , who was happily busy getting ready to " take a crap , " as he called toggling the bombs  --  except for him we were all frozen at our stations waiting to get ours . There were no fighters yet . After spotting the JU-88 , Junior Sailen said , " They must be using a predicted barrage . " We all had flak on our minds . The terrible thing was the enforced passivity . You could strike back against fighters , and under attack from them we shouted a lot on interphone to work together in our common defense . With flak we just had to sit there and fly through it and hope they 'd miss . Beforethe actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees or so every twenty or thirty seconds ; it had all been laid out in the briefing . But on the run we had to fly straight as a pool cue for ninety seconds , and that was when I felt most helpless . Neither Marrow nor I could even help fly then , because we had a gadget called Automatic Flight Control Equipment , which held you as if on railroad tracks , and on the run Max Brindt actually flew us , through his bombsight being tied up with the AFCE . There we sat , strapped down with safety belts , so a near miss would n't knock us out of our seats , and waited . Max broke our tension after he let the bombs go . You could feel the ship tremble as they vacated her belly , and Max told usp209they were away , and he gave the controls back to Marrow , who began to swim us all over the sky , which would n't necessarily evade flak but made us feel better , and then , several seconds later , when Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , he hollered on the interphone , with his babyish glee : " Voom ! Clobberedthe bastards ! Voom voom voom . " We all began to chatter then , and enemy fighters hit us , and we felt lots better . From that day onward , through all the raids leading up to the Schweinfurt strike , I was petrified by the sight and thought of flak , which once had seemed so harmless , so beautiful . And so  --  I happened to learn from Daphne on the eve of the Schweinfurt raid  --  was my great pilot , Marrow , who told all corners that he feared no man or thing , and who was soon to be regarded , in the world 's eyes , as a hero . The following day was Memorial Day , and a Sunday , and the weather was good but no mission was scheduled , so I called Daphne and arranged to meet her at noon in the street in front of Barclay 's Bank in Motford Sage . That gave me plenty of time to go to a nine-o'clock service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admin block , in memory of the men who had died in our Group . Now Preacher Plate , as I have said , had been a saxophone player , and I guess he knew the power of a short musical line , and he had promised in his notice advertising the memorial service that at least it would be brief , and it certainly was , for he lined us up ( a very large number of men showed ) , and all he did was to hold up a book and read these words : " Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth , while the evil days come not , nor the years draw nigh , when thou shalt say , I have no pleasure in them:While the sun , or the light , or the moon , or the stars be not darkened , nor the clouds return after the rain : In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , andp210the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease , because they are few , and those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of music shall be brought low . Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high , and fears shall be in the way , and the almond tree shall flourish , and the grasshopper shall be a burden , and desire shall fail : because man goeth to his long home , and the mourners go about the streets : Or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern . Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was : and the spirit shall returnunto God who gave it . " He lowered the book and dismissed us , and I rode off on my bike to meet Daphne , thinking of Braddock , who was dead . Along the road I stopped for a while on a stone bridge over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket of gnarled osiers . These trees had often been pollarded , perhaps in order to make baskets out of their shoots ; the eleven-o'clock sun was bright on the trembling narrow yellowish leaves of the new growth . I thought , without regret or fear , that the days of my youth were far behind me . Flying was making me old . There was a deep pool under the trees , and its water was black and still , and it mirrored the lacework of the osier 's leaves . Hearing the words from the Bible that the padre had read , and having had in mind the young men who were dead  --  very young boys , some of them , who had died without having learned a single thing about people or the world  --  I thought : Religion is of no good to me . My forebears were Presbyterian ; my parents were what I think of as automatic church-goers . I guess they believed . Our minister in Donkentown was a prig and a bore . As soon as I was well launched into years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps because of the attitude of some members of our congregation that they were among the absolutely elected , while others in the world were not ; they took baths on Saturday night and put on irresistible grace for an hour or so on Sunday morning . Some of them could be pretty un-Christian on weekdays.  |p211I  loved the language of the Bible  --  as literature  --  but religion was not much use to me . Some of the men who patronized the Nissen hut on the base that the padre used as a chapel were doubtless devout , but most of them , I wagered , went for the purpose of lining up magic aids to survival ; for them church was like tossing a pinch of spilt salt over the left shoulder . I guess the best I could say for myself was that I had a vague sense of decency . I had tried to tell Daphne about it , a few days before , but I was n't sure exactly what it was , or where it came from . It was n't a natural product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , had produced some men , whom I intimatelyknew , who had none of the sense and no very great share of the thing itself : Marrow , Max Brindt , Jughead Farr  --  though Farr was to surprise me in time . It was related , though , to a basic American notion , that anything that contained the spark of life should not be pushed around . There was more to it than that . My time with Daphne had opened up in me a realization that part of what I meant by decency , or dignity , was the one aptitude , aside from higher intellection , that set men apart from animals  --  the greater faculty of selfdenyinglove . I was for that . I doubt if I ever would have said such a thing out loud at the base , because I would have caught an unholyrazz . In the face of a distinguished body of literary works to the contrary , however , I had come to think that my belief in the importance of this kind of love was widely , though secretively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , and I think , indeed , that the vociferousness of the razz would have bespoken the depth , the life-saving depth , of the conviction . This faculty was something Marrow not only did not have , but scorned . Perhaps this was why we came , in the end , to be enemies . I grew cheerful as I pedaled on , and I waited for Daphne on the sidewalk in Motford Sage in a sunshine that seemed to soak into me.  |p212The  bus from Cambridge stopped across the way from Barclay 's Bank , in a square , at the center of which a stone horse trough encircled a well . I held my ground , and Daph ran across the cobbled street and stood in front of me , with her head on one side . I said , " Mind walking ? " She said , " Not with you . Never . " " Might have to run a bit , " I said . " All right , darling , " she said . " Let 's hurry . " We got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one look at my Daph and nodded her head at me , in approval . She said she 'd been expecting us . I liked her . She fixed us a pot of tea and brought it up to the room and said , using a minimumnumber of words , that she had to visit an ailing friend and would be gone until six o'clock and hoped we would n't mind an empty house . Slight smile gripping her dry lips . " She 's a lamb , " Daphne said after she had left . I said I was sorry the room was n't fancier , and I started to tell Daph about Mrs. Porlock 's husband and sons , but halfway through the catalogue of their deaths I found myself in Daphne 's arms . Archie and Willie Porlock , rest their souls , had slept alive in lumpy beds ; we sampled both that afternoon , and we found that we were deeply , joyfully , unreservedly given to each other . In quiet interludes we laughed hard over nothings . I had never in my life been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was offering me a woman 's innermost gift : identification . She seemed to renounce all former convictions and poses and quite sincerely to take on , as hers , my opinions , my prejudices , even many of my mannerisms and turns of speech . All this was profoundly flattering to me , for it gave me a sense of my own worth that I had n't had before . We had only to touch , finger tip to finger tip , for us both to be consumed with our need for each other . " Why did you let me make love to you that first night ? " I asked , because it seemed that a single kiss now gave more reward than that whole first importunate grabbing had given . Daphne ran a finger , at her own risk , down my nose , over my lips , and back and forth across my chin . " Because , " she said , " I'mp213the sort who finds it hard to give up today 's pleasure for tomorrow 's much greater pleasure . " That seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she added , " Besides , I thought you might leave me . " I had just begun to revolve that in my mind when she further said , " Why should a man do anything he wants and a woman have to wait for . . . for . . . " I laughed , because her feminism was so weak . She laughed , too , but perhaps , in the outcome , something about this was to cause her pain and me bewilderment . Giving too much of herself to me had to lead to her trying to save some of herself , I guess . I tried to tell Daphne of my new feeling about flak . " I want to live , " I said , holding her close to me . But as I said that , I knew that it was not as simple as that ; all my crewmates shared my feelingabout flak , but they did n't share Daphne , my particular reason for loving life . I realized that our new attitude toward anti-aircraft fire must have been part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lore of survival  --  wiser , perhaps , in knowing that survival in aerial combat was largely out of our hands . These thoughts got me started pouring stuff out to Daphne about some of my crewmates . I found myself unable to say enough in Neg Handown 's praise , for this thirty-six-year-old boy , who behavedso peculiarly in London , was in the air as substantial and immovable as the Dover cliffs we loved so much to see on coming home from danger . During the previous day 's mission Neg 's massivesolidity had really come to the front . Max Brindt had talked so much in early days about being hit by flak ( Max , who delighted so in hitting with bombs ) that we had all cone to believe that such a thing might happen  --  all of us save Handown , who just seemed to go about his business . How he loved his small corner of the plane ! He treated his guns , his delicate automatic gunsight , and his complicatedturret as he might have treated children of his own . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on missions his guns ran like sewing machines , and he kept checking the harmonization of his sight , and he constantly moved his turret to keep the hydraulic fluid warm and so have a lively turret . He had great stamina and a burning sense of responsibility , and it was he who called in by far the greatest number of enemy fighters first , many of them far outside his sector of search . And in the midst of our fear of the flak on the way to St. Nazaire he had struck in onp214interphone singing , " There 'll be no promotion this side of the ocean . " I had shut him up , but his steady , firm voice had bucked up my courage . By contrast Farr was getting more and more sour . Though he had often said he liked the open waist window because firing through it was like shooting skeet , he had now shifted his unendingtorrent of complaint to the poor provision of armor plate for waist gunners . Whereas most men managed to utter their gripes and then master their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter bones , until at last he concluded he was being discriminated against , and he began to fume about grocery clerks who 'd become ninety-day wonders in order to push him around . " I 'd like to stand some of those so-called officers up against a wall and plug ' em . " Farr was perfect firing-squad material . Yet Marrow lumped all the enlisted crewmen , Handown as well as Farr , together for condemnation , not only in his crazy tirades against sergeants but also in his more reasoned talk . The career gunners , he said , were under-educated , and anyway , as infantsthey had n't been fed enough cod-liver oil , or whatever it was that gave you the I.O. to tell your ass from your ear . The only thinkingthey did was to figure out how to goof off , and the only reason they looked ahead was to see whether they could get out of a stint . " Boman , " he said , as if it were a compliment , " I could make you a better gunner than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My " ship . Yes , I see now that I was getting riled , that sunny afternoon in the squalid room of dead brothers with my only known love , about my pilot , Marrow . Daphne listened to me , in her quiet way , still and deep as that pool under the osiers along the road . She did not comment then , but she silently stored up , to be able to give it to me some day , her treasure of understanding . During the inactivity of the first days of June , some of the more enterprising combat crews , including our own , inspired perhapsby the beefed-up YB-40s , designed and built gun-mounts forp215twin instead of single fifty-caliber machine guns at the waist-windowpositions . Fan and Brangnani had all but finished installing their new mounts when , on Memorial Day , an order came down from Wing ordering all such twin-fifties removed . Our crews were enraged . Wing , as usual , gave no reason for the command . Perhapsthey thought we 'd overload our planes and slow them down . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twin-fifties , and after a few days he had worked up enough of a storm so that Group finally put in a formal application to Wing for permission to modify the mounts . Nothing happened , and nothing happened . I was lying on my sack after lunch , one Tuesday , bored silly , reading a funny piece in a copy of Stars and Stripes that I 'd scrounged from the trash drum at the end of the hut  --  only it was n't funny  --  about how hard it was for this jerk of a 4-F who was making $65 a week just out of high school to get home from a vacation in Florida , when Buzz came in and said , " I got to move . Let 's go for a ride . " I pointed out that it was drizzling . " So when did it ever not ? " he said . We had had a spell of weather which made us think that someone had acted upon the standard G.I. query about the island on which we were stationed : " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " We felt as if we were sunk . The days had gone like this : May thirty-first , cold , wet , and windy ; June first , beautiful clear dawn , cloudy by eight thirty , rain by noon , wind in afternoon , stoves going by evening to drive away the chill ; June second , nine separate fronts , some bearing hailstones , and more to come ; June third , electrical disturbances . And so on , day after day . We had begun to abuse Stormy Peters , as if the inclemency were his fault . By that Tuesday , June eighth , we were all three-quarters crazy . We had n't had a raid since what we had come to think of as Flak Day , May twenty-ninth ; I ' had n't seen Daph since the thirti/eth . All the excitement we 'd had was one scrubbing ( Caen ) , a visit from a Senator , and Farr getting blotto the day he was finally supposed to receive a promotion . " I 'm on , " I said . Marrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he had wrecked the front wheel of one machine , by wrenchingit sidewise out of a bike rack , and he had n't bothered to put in for another . Before we started out on our ride he hooked the bestlookingwheel he could find in the racks at the Admin building . Off we went in a gentle rain . We stopped first at the Star in Bartleck and had a beer , and I could see that Marrow 's teeth were on edge . Old Whelan had posted a notice a couple of days before directing personnel to wear Class A uniforms when away from the base . But Buzz remembered that weeks earlier Whelan had classifiedcycling as an athletic sport , so this afternoon he had talked me into leaving my blouse at home and wearing a leather jacket ; we were just going out for a " workout " to test the situation . In the Star Buzz developed the theme of Whelan 's insanity , and said he just wished a bloody M.P . would come in and try to start something . We moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought with an ache in my chest about Daphne , and our sun-filled room at the Porlocks ' , and our drawing together there . We stopped at the Cat and the Fiddle , at a country crossroads , and at the Old Abbott Inn in Motford Sage , where Daph and Buzz and I had had lunch that day , and that made me miss her all the more ; and then at some other public houses in Motford Sage  --  the ' Wheat Sheaf , the Bell , the Sceptre , the Blue Anchor . We had one beer in each place , and in the Blue Anchor we had an argument about how many pubs we 'd tallied . I think that I was right and Buzz was wrong . Anyway , we lost interest in setting a record and just stayed there , and we both began beefing about the missions Wing had been setting up for us . Publicity raids , Marrow said . Killingsheep , I said . Noball targets . S  --  ty bombing . Fighter bait . Marrow was furious at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the twin-fifties . Buzz railed at the brass for a while , then suddenly he said , " The thing I like about flying  --  it 's like it used to be out of doorsp217when I was a kid , with your friends . Nobody to jump on your neck . We had the best f  --  ing time . I remember once we had this firecrackerfight . We took big ones , double-enders , you know , bombs : they would go off on the ground and then go off in the air . We had these brick forts , and we made these slanting troughs for the double-enders , and we 'd shoot ' em off and they 'd go over toward the enemy fort and go off there ; and the other guys were shooting at us . It was keen . " As he talked Marrow looked like a small boy . But then he was suddenly sore at Jughead Farr . " Stupid bastard , getting soused the day he was going to get his stripe . " Farr had complained for weeks about not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice removed , after brawls . Took the line that the officers were just trying to keep him down . " You want to know something , Boman ? I think Fan 's one of those fake tough babies that all he really wants is a swift kick in the ass . I mean he asks for it . He whines and whines till you give it to him , and then he 's like teacher 's pet . " After that I had one of my rare arguments with Marrow . I guess I used to figure that the easiest way to handle him was to keep the peace , give in and agree even when I inwardly disagreed . But when he got going about Senator Tamalty I just had to speak up . On Saturday , June the fifth , the Tannoy had announced in the morning that distinguished visitors were expected on the base that afternoon and that combat crews and base personnel should stand by in quarters in uniform for a parade review at about one o'clock . As always happens , the VIPs were late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time a cortege of black cars pulled in at Admin , and the Tannoy called us out on the double , and they formed us in a three-sided box , in the drizzle , and Whelan introduced a party of Senators and Congressmen , who were touringthe battlefields , and presented " for a word or two " the HonorableFrancis P. Tamalty of the U.S. Senate , who seemed to be the dean of the group . He was a real man of the gravel pits , a primitive , with bulging veins and a pronounced speech defect  --  a lisp which he had , so to speak , furiously crushed , so it had become what he must have felt was a manly thickening of words . He stood up before us and talked nearly as long as it took to fly to the Dutch coast . The blood of American boys was as saliva in his mouth . You ca n't trust allies ; have to be strong enough to stand alone . Nations , likep218men , had to be practical . " I know the Frenchies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Later research by Kid Lynch developedthe information that Private Tamalty never got east of a camp near Fayetteville , South Carolina . ) Amarrcan knowhow . As it says in the book of Isaiah . Mothers by their hearth-fires . No man 's brother is as good a watcher at the gates as that man 's self . Self . Of course . That was what appealed to Marrow . Marrow had never seen such a hero . Wanted to run the patriotfor President , get rid of Roosevelt , who only knew how to give things away with his eyes closed . Cripple anyhow . Everything from the waist down . When a man was paralyzed there .. . Well , I finally said my say about the Senator . Marrow blinked with amazement at my daring to speak out against both Tamalty and Marrow . At one time Buzz had the gall to say , " Shush , son , you 're surrounded by English ears . " And so we were . Some elderly men , laborers of some kind , with limestone faces and fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and they had fallen silent and were listening intentlyto us . Marrow talked louder than ever . Began to pitch in on the Frogs . Suddenly he let out a peal of laughter . Martin Foley , a pilot in our squadron , had announced that he was going to study French in one of the language classes that had been set up on the base by the Special Events Officer . " Imagine , Foley the F  --  up , trying to parley voo . " Marrow bellowed . The idea of trying to learn a foreignlanguage , and French of all languages , struck Marrow as very funny . " He figures he stands a good chance of getting shot down over France , " I said , " and maybe getting to use his parachute . " " Let the sons of bitches speak English , " Marrow said with brutal force . " Matie . " One of the old Englishmen was tapping Marrow on the shoulder . " Do they put up classes in the King 's English at the Yank aerodrome ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in his face . " Your King stutters , " he said . " Aye , " the man said , very benign . He nodded happily , as if stuttering were quite a feat.  | " Let 's get out of here , " Marrow said . " This stuff tastes like " Aye , " the man said . " Listen , stupid , " Marrow said , turning his chair full around , " what makes you think you 'd be sitting here enjoying yourself at all if the Americans had n't come over to fight your war for you ? " " Henjoying meself ? " " You 'd be browning your nose on some Nazi 's bum . " " Never ! " the old man said , and he bounced two or three times with an odd laugh that came out of him at the absurdity of the young American 's ideas . Suddenly there were three R.A.F. enlisted men behind Marrow'schair . Marrow saw them out of the corner of his eye , and he turned and said to me , " Silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they accomplish ? Kill civilians , I guess . " He took a sip from his glass . " If that 's what you want to do in a war . " One of the R.A.F. men grasped the straight back of Marrow 's chair and gave it a single powerful shake which threw Marrow to his feet . I stood up . Marrow 's jaw was sticking out like an engraved invitation . " Hoy ! " the old man who had been talking to Marrow now said with his face up to the R.A.F. men . " This cheeky bahstit , " the man who had rocked Marrow 's chair said . " ' Ere , ' ere , " the old man said . " Let 's ' ave friendly language . " At this the three R.A.F. men turned away from Marrow and started toward the bar . " God-damn limey chicken s  --  , " Marrow said , ostensibly to me but loudly enough to be heard all the way to the bar . " Come on , Boman . " You could see the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned . As we went out of the door I heard the old fellow say to his friends , " ' Omesick , poor miserable bloke . " When we got outside to the bicycle racks we found that the bike Marrow had been riding was gone . Forgetting altogether that he himself had swiped the machineon the base in the first place , Marrow began screaming aboutp220the sneaky British . God-damn limeys stealing an American bike . " Bunch of bloody crooks , " he shouted . He was really teed . He wanted to go inside and pick a fight with the three R.A.F. boys , but I managed to persuade him that it was quite unlikely that they had taken the bicycle , inasmuch as they were still in the pub . For a while we tried to make our way by riding each other , taking turns at the pedals and on the bar , but we were both beerlogged , and we zigzagged and fell down often . At last we came to a fish-and-chips vender 's horse-drawn van , and we ate some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a scarf wound round and round his neck , to drive us back to the base for two pounds  --  more than he could make in several days of selling fish and chips  --  and we put my bike in the back and rode , all three in the cab , to the clopping of an old gray 's feet . Our heads were wreathed with the acrid smell of hot deep fat . A weather front peeled back the dripping clouds , and there was an apple-green sky over a sparkling landscape . On Wednesday , June the ninth , we went to Cambridge and heard the university students sing madrigals on the banks of the Cam , and I lay beside Daphne among the listeners on the grass under the enormous trees of the Backs , full of desire in the warm afternoon . Between numbers some Yank near us said to his pal that the concert was part of an annual celebration , which was , he said , called May Week because it was in June . " These screwy limeys , " the pal said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered off with some others , and Daph and I hired a punt and drifted on the narrow river along the Backs , under the marvelous King 's and Clare and Garret Hostel and Trinity and St. Johns bridges , for an hour or so , and it was then that I worked my way , with Daphne 's help , to some thoughts which foreshadowed my crisis of late July . While the students had been singing their **30;933;TOOLONG , about which I knew nothing , my mind had wandered , and I had spent some time thinking about girls back in the States . There had always been a girl . I had some very particular associationswith the casual ones during the phases . With Penny it was a moving picture in Sikeston , Missouri , called Here Comes Mr. Jordan ; with Sybil it was her old man 's Buick , in the mountains out of Denver , parked in a turnout , not even necking , but listening to Tommy Dorsey on the car radio ; with Marylee it was a tune , This Love of Mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alabama . All through the whole time , like a theme , ran Janet , my home-town girl , who was official , who seemed inescapable , like an inheritance . The reward of this ruminationhad been to appreciate Daphne all the more , for with each girl , no matter how much of a yen I had had for her , I had always been conscious of some quality that grated on my nerves , and with Daphne I could find no cause for holding back . I got the knack of poling the punt right off the bat , then after a while I just sat in the stern , and we talked . Daphne was open with me . There was no language barrier . In some way we cut straight through our differences of nationality and experience . I understood that she had seldom provoked aggressive behaviorin men , for though she was fragile and feminine , she had , besides , the enormous inner strength of a woman at peace with herself . " We never argue about anything , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss you so much when I 'm away from you , how could I spoil the time when we 're together ? " She loved longing ; it was clear that she loved the suffering that a deep attachment could bring . " What would you do for me ? " she asked . The things I promised to do were out of songs . Climb a mountain . Slow boat to China . I could write a book . Swim the ocean wide . I 'll make a string of pearls out of the dew  --  my safe song . Yes , with Daph I felt , above all , far away from danger of any kind . Then suddenly it seemed that Daphne was cross-examining me a little . " What do you want of me ? " she asked . It was an anguishedquestion and took me by surprise.  |p222Bed  came into my mind first , but I knew I must give a better answer than that . Comfort when I am in despair . Good company ; good talking ; good laughing . A way to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was clear that Daphne wanted to shake some kind of open-ended commitment out of me , a promise , a very big promise , and all of a sudden I was chary and evasive . " There 's a war on , " I said , as if to explain my long pause . " I want this war to be over and done with . " " Why are you in it ? " she asked . " I mean , what have you to do with war ? " Her question was oddly worded , and I should have known Daphne well enough by then to realize that she meant the questionexactly as she asked it , for I suppose she had a woman 's belief that wars could only end when men refused to fight in them , but I was rattled , and I probably would have scoffed at that belief as too namby-pamby , soft , because I certainly did n't think that conscientious objectors would bring a warless world , and anyway I chose to believe that she had simply asked me the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm fighting for , " I said . " Certainly not for Senator Tamalty 's brand of patriotism . I do n't think any of our guys are fighting for that  --  not even Marrow . I think they 're fightingto finish twenty-five missions , period . I know that does n't sound very good to somebody who 's English , Daph , but I swear , I think that 's the only war aim . Every mission you get behind you is one more mission toward getting finished . If you can just get through it alive , that 's the thing . " I think I was too embarrassed even with Daphne to speak of the sense of decency that had been on my mind . I thought some more later on about trying to kill in order to stay alive . In school in Donkentown , when I had been about ten years old , I 'd been interested in dinosaurs . Maybe it was because I was so small , such a shorty , that I was crazy about brontosauruses and stegosauruses and triceratopses and allosauruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those beasts took millions of years to adapt themselves to killing in order to stay alive  --  did it by developing spikes as tall as men , tails that could knock down houses , collars of bone as big as the sides of Sherman tanks , clawsp223like axe blades . They had brains the size of walnuts . And seventyfivemillions of years had passed and I , in my Flying Fortress , with my brain the size of a goodly grapefruit , might just as well be a tooth in a leather-winged pterosaur . It seemed to me that for civilizedman , it was not enough to have as the central idea of life mere survival . When I came to think more carefully about the question Daphne really had asked me  --  what had I to do with war ?  --  I realized that fighting in the war was something I was doing simply because it seemed easier than not doing it . I was a member of a community in which flying and fighting were the only accepted ways of behaving . It all seemed to come down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that was not considered normal , proper , usual . At the same time , looking at Daphne in her yellow dress on the green thwart of the flat-bottomed boat , I knew that I would far rather live than die . What would I do for her ? she had asked me . At the end of July , at the height of the series of raids we called our Blitz , having put Kid Lynch 's body to rest in the U.S. military cemetery here at Cambridge , I passed through a crisis in my attitude which came from trying to pull these confused and conflicting thoughts together , and it was not until the . last trying passage of the Schweinfurt raid that I was to come face to face with what they all meant for me . On the day of the madrigal concertthey were merely random , troublesome ideas . When our hour 's rental of the punt was over , we went to Daphne 's apartment . A bunch of us were sitting around in Titty 's room , gassingabout a mission we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In walked a screwball character I 'd seen around the station ,  |p224who  looked about sixteen years old , a flaming redhead , and I saw LYNCH stenciled on his leather jacket and assumed it was the jocko everyone called the Kid , who kept reading poems , ditties , dob gerel , and wisecracks over the Tannoy  --  I guess with the acquiescenceof the Special Events officer . The Kid would break into the middle of nothing on a rainy afternoon with a clean limerick . Alwayssigned off , " Lieutenant Lynch reporting . " Some guys thought him a nuisance , but I 'd been for him , sight unseen , on the ground that he was a co-pilot who was said to be a much better flier than his first pilot . A man in a position like that has to disseminate screwy verse . We in Titty 's room got talking about the lone black Fort , the German spotter , which we 'd seen again that afternoon . Following a briefing for Bremen and a leisurely take-off at noon , clouds had made an attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bremerhaven for our secondary , the lead group , too eager or not poised enough , had swung too sharply , and the turns of succeeding groups had grown wider and wider , till ours , at the end of the line , like that of the outermost man in a game of Crack the Whip , had overswung so far that our bombing had finally been rushed and poor , and we had cut for home , disgusted , and then , in the evening sky , tracking us from a position to the rear and high above the last element of our Group , that unmarkedB-i7 had made its appearance and had stayed with us nearly halfway across the North Sea and at last had turned back and had flown , unescorted and incongruous , toward Germany . While we were talking about the spotter , someone brought up the concept of the Germans as good fighters , good sportsmen . All Quiet on the Western Front . Wings . Kid Lynch kept quiet . Marrow said one of our crippled planes had pulled out of formationon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters not only had n't fired on it but had hovered around it , sort of mothering it down to the ground . The Krauts probably wanted another spotting ship , but Marrow had to believe that this was the Code of the Sky . Never shoot at a man in a chute . The Victory Roll . The fellowship of aviators . Fliers were different from other men ; enemy fliers were more like you than Allied foot soldiers . Then Lynch spoke up , and at first he rattled me , but I see now what he was doing . He wanted to show this **25;965;TOOLONG that all the crap about the chivalry of the air was just a way to pretend everything was going to be safe and nice  --  for Number One , one 's self . Of course the Kid had uphill going in our crowd . Humanity 's abomination was not at all clear to us , for we 'd been too young for Spain , and it was too soon for Auschwitz , and we thought we had , in the Fortress and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the greatest weapons man would ever hold in his fist  --  because of course our war was going to be the last war ever . There 's too much idiocy at large about how we were disenchanted young men who 'd been wised up by A Farewell to Arms and Soldier 's Pay and Three Soldiers . We were up to our tallywhackers in illusions , slogans , shibboleths , belief in magic  --  mostly out of ads . We were ready to die to the last man for Dinah Shore , rare sirloin , a cold beer , and a Caribbeancruise . Maybe we did n't put much stock in the Four Freedoms ; that was propaganda . But we really believed in Time and the Post and Collier 's and Life . Anyway , the Kid said he 'd heard from the boys in S-2 that this fellow in the spotting plane was known as the Black Knight , he was from the Black Forest , he wore a black onyx ring that Hitler had given him , he had taken pilgrimages to all the scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle web out of fantastic threads , and that night he took strands , I guess , from the Nibelungenring and from the Grimms and the Walpurgisnacht , and I tell you , it was creepy . IIe threw in a bit of Faineant Le Noir for good measure . It was the first time I ever saw Marrow scared . After the session broke up he took me in our room and questioned me , with a kind of feverish desperation , about how much I thought Lynch knew , and whether all that could be true about the Black Knight . I had to face it that Marrow half believed every word the Kid had said . I think Lynch had Marrow believing that each evening the Black Knight drank a tiny silver gobletfull of blood drawn from the veins of captured R.A.F. and U.S.A.A.F. pilots . After that , when we saw the Black Knight on missions , Marrow would suddenly becomecautious , and would start raising hell with me about manifoldpressures and oil temperatures.  |p226Lynch  dropped into the seat next to mine at supper the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lulus for pilots , " he said . " At least mine can fly , " I said . I 'd heard about the clunk Lynch had drawn , Bessemer . " I do n't know which I 'd less rather have , " he said , " a born non-flier like mine or a bloody hell 's angel like yours . Boy , that Airman 's Code stuff ! " I told Lynch that Marrow was human , that he 'd just adopted a pet dog  --  a half-starved medium-sized long-haired nondescript  --  and that he was pretty good to it , and the pup had taken to him at once . And about how Marrow felt about sergeants , and about his old man having been a sergeant in the First World War . And that just before I 'd come over to the mess hall , Buzz had said : " Know what I 'm going to do ? I 'm going to inject this mut with hydrophobia and let him go after some of these sergeants . " But Lynch got off that topic . " Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that beginning back in the winter hoodlums dressed in exaggerated pegtop trousers and long jackets and pointed shoes , and wearing enormous watch chains , had begunwaylaying lone sailors in San Pedro , beating them up and sometimes stabbing them , and over the months had extended their crazy operations to the whole Los Angeles area . Lynch told me that there had been open warfare in the past week between bands of servicemen and gangs of zoot-suiters . My eye had vaguely wandered across two-line items about the zoot-suiters in Stars and Stripes , but Lynch was up on all the details  --  thecircumference of zoot pants at the cuff and at the thigh  --  and what interested me was the fiery intensity with which he talked . He wanted me to discuss with him the reasons for these outbursts  --  guilt over high wages and non-combat status , latent homosexuality , the pose of indifference on the West Coast ; the Kid was full of theories . This was the first conversation with any meat in it that I 'd had in a long time . Lynch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might lose his life , and he wanted top227know and feel all he could , good and bad , about the country for which he might be asked to pay the ultimate tax . This earnestness surprised me . The uninhibited Kid who broadcast doggerel and bad jokes on the Tannoy had n't prepared me for this other man . Lynch was pretty ugly to look at , yet he gave an impression of charm and even beauty . His hair was of an unbelievable redness  --  not russet or auburn , but the color of the undersides of stratus clouds in one of the sudden-flash sunsets we used to have in Donkentown ; you expected the violent glint to fade off his head any moment , to give way to gray and night . His eyes had something wrong with them : the folds of skin and conjunctiva around the lids were somehow pulled tight , so his eyes seemed too small and piggish . He had not the usual redhead 's creamy complexion but a pitted and thick-looking skin , like canvas or a fruit rind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . The rapiditywith which his mind worked ; the warmth of his feelings ; his wit , heard on his tongue and seen in his queer eyes ; and , perhaps most impressive of all , the passionate seriousness that underlay his flippancy  --  all these gave him more than enough to pay back the debt on his looks . He was twenty-two , and he was a college graduate , a married man , and  --  hard to believe !  --  the father of two daughters . Maybe this was where the seriousness came from . At the table in the mess hall , amid the crude jokes being passed back and forth like mashed potatoes , Lynch secretively showed me a snapshot of his " three women . " The little fat girls were redheads , too  --  Ruby and Ginger ( nicknames , he told me ) . I 'll bet I was the only man on the base who knew that the Kid was a father . We had a raid the next day , June thirteenth , our eleventh mission in The Body , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , to seek Lynch out and talk it over with him.  |p228The  mission as a whole had been a dud , because another wing , not ours , had cut off from its briefed course about thirty miles before the initial point and had headed straight for the target , and this short cut had put it on a collision course with our Wing , which had followed instructions , so we were forced to circle wide to avoid the others , and in the ensuing confusion most of our groups dropped their bombs a couple of miles from the city out in the sea . But I could n't help telling Lynch that this had been our best raid in The Body . Fighter opposition had been stiff , and we had been hot . Reports of sightings by our crew had been quick and concise , and our interphone discipline had been tight . Lynch and I , still in our flying suits , holding sandwiches at the Red Cross stand , talked rapidly back and forth and sometimes we put the food down and , with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I seemed to want to convince Lynch that Marrow was a remarkablepilot . His evasive tactics that afternoon had been superb . Under head-on and tail attacks , he had devised a subtle , eccentric corkscrewing , a spiral path varying from four to six compass degreesout of the line of flight , which must have given the Germans exceedingly difficult targets , as their reflection allowances must have been continually varying ; yet Marrow seemed to hold formationand over-all course as truly as any . Another thing : We got a radio message , halfway home , that there were some VIPs visiting Pike Rilling and that upon returning to base we were to take one low pass over the field , flying smart formation , and I told Lynch that Marrow had turned the plane over to me for that run ( having a puppy must 've made him kind-hearted ) , and I 'd felt great , supposing that Hap Arnold , or Clark Gable , or somebody else of consequence was down on the ground watching me hold The Body in there like a screwed-on attachment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he meant by the shrug . Just then Marrow came over and tore down before Lynch all that I had built up about him . He was laughing hard . " Boman , " he said , barely able to control his heaving and cackling enough to speak . " Boman , Jesus , the joke 's on you , kid . Foley got shot down . Over Germany . Now that he can talk French . You and your God/damn foreign languages . " And he went rollicking off to tell someoneelse ; I gathered later that he kept telling the story as a joke on me . That evening Lynch told me that he had heard about Marrow'shaving knocked the bottom out of the old cup at the Bartleck railway station and that he , Lynch , had , a few days later , sneaked a new enamel cup out of the mess hall and had carried it to the village on his bike and had hung it on the spigot against the stationwall , to replace the wayfarer 's cup one of our men had destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over the field today , too , but that was only because Bessemer may be a first pilot but he ca n't fly formation yet . He 's promised me he 'd try to learn how . But listen , Bo , what makes you think Marrow was being kindheartedto you , letting you fly that run ? In his language that was an insult . Marrow 'll fly when it matters , Boman can fly for the shiny-ass brass . " I stood up for Marrow : said he was n't like that . Doc Randall , his huge hands flailing , conducted a class on venereal diseases . They had scrubbed Le Mans in the morning , and now in the afternoon they had assembled all the officers in the Number One Mess . Doc seemed embarrassed , and we guessed that Loony-bug Whelan had put him up to it . Doc showed us a movie on how to catch a dose . We got cheering for the microbes , as if they were the Good Guys . Lynch and Marrow and I walked back across " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the living area of the base . Marrow said , " Any of you guys know how to dip a sheep ? " From a farmer near Bartleck , Marrow had acquired somesheep-dip , so he could free his ever-scratching pup of vermin . Lynch , who seemed to know everything , instructed Buzz . " It 'll be quite an experience for both of you , " he said . When we got to our room Marrow took one look at his pup , really a sad apple , and said , " Watch out , fleas , here I come ! "
