For six hours one day last week , the roar of auto engines echoed against the foothills of the Rocky Mountains as 23 cars gunned and slid around the $500,000 Continental Divide Raceways near Denver . The competition on the twisty , 2.8-mile circuit was the first endurance race to see how well Detroit 's new compact cars stack up against their competition both at home and from abroad . <P> Under the rules only hardtop sedans and coupes with engines no bigger than 3,500 cc. could enter , and all V-8s were excluded . Lined up at the start in ten classes were cars from the U.S. , Britain , France . Germany and Sweden . The entries that held all eyes were the new Chevrolet Corvairs and Ford Falcons , both competing in the same class ( 2,001 to 2,500 cc. ) and each with top drivers and pit crews . Chevy made it a major effort , with five cars and a 25-man pit crew sponsored by the Denver Chevrolet Dealers Association . Not to be outdone , Denver Ford dealers entered three cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . <P> As testimony to the ruggedness of the small cars , there were no mechanical breakdowns . But the race was hard on the standard tires , particularly those on Chevy 's five Corvairs , which had to slow down to make sure that they would finish . At the final flag , American Motors ' Rambler was out in front averaging 55.5 m.p.h. , with a Volkswagen second . A pair of Ford Falcons drove off with third and fourth , and two Corvairs had to settle for sixth and seventh .
