Lightheartedly , French Novelist Pierre Daninos said yes when ECA asked him to write the captions for a NATO movie cartoon . Then , because this made him a foreign employee of a U.S. Government agency , Daninos received the usual four-page questionnaire asking about his 1 ) birth &; parentage , 2 ) complexion &; distinctive body marks , 3 ) emotional &; mental state , 4 ) drinking habits , 5 ) aliases , if any , 6 ) connections with the Communist Party , if any , 7 ) past &; present employment in detail-and some 50 other questions . Daninos filled in the questionnaire , named three character references , duly swore that he had no intention of " upsetting the U.S. Government by force or violence . " <P> Eight days later , Daninos received a second questionnaire repeating many of the previous questions . Daninos blew up . Last week the Paris Figaro frontpaged a Daninos letter to President Truman . Said Daninos : " Being only vaguely informed about the U.S. , I would like to proceed with an ' investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " 1 ) What were you doing before the discovery of America ? ( List of residences before and after 1492-complete history of employment. ) 2 ) What is your complexion ? Distinctive marks and characteristics ? 3 ) References : give the names of three major and responsible countries , not related to you by blood or alliance , qualified to give precise information about you . 4 ) Are you suffering from any serious troubles ? ( Political ? Mental ? Epidemic ? ) . 5 ) May I consider that during the course of the past twelve months none among you has drunk alcoholic liquor to excess ? Oui ? Non ? " In case some might think him anti-American , Daninos explained : " I am nothing but a damned individualist who would not seek the tiniest louse on the head of the United States if they would not try to find one on mine .
