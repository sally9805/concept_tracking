The Justice Department won a round last week in the case of Owen Lattimore , once an important influence in framing U.S. policy in the Far East . Last summer a U.S. Court of Appeals voided the key count in Lattimore 's perjury indictment - for denying that he was " a sympathizer of Communism " - because the word " sympathizer " has too many differing dictionary definitions . <P> Last week a Federal Grand Jury indicted Lattimore for denying that he had been 1 ) a " follower of the Communist line " and 2 ) a " promoter of Communist interests . " The new indictment lists 132 instances where , it says , Lattimore 's writings and the Communist Party line coincided .
