" It has now been made crystal clear that the American people hold the networks responsible for what appears on their schedules . " With that belated recognition of the obvious , CBS President Frank Stanton announced that his network will no longer permit " games whose major appeal is the winning of large sums of money or lavishly expensive prizes . " CBS followed through by axing The Big Payoff , Top Dollar and Name That Tune . <P> But rival NBC wanted none of that solution . Suggesting archly that to be consistent CBS would have to drop such petty-cash guessing games as I 've Got a Secret and What 's My Line ? , NBC said that it would make its own shows honest from top dollar to bottom , because " millions of Americans like and want them . " <P> As past contestants reappeared in the newspapers to plead innocence or cast suspicion , and TV reporters wrote reams of copy designed to show that they had really been in the know all along , considerable suspicion piled up against CBS 's $64,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite TV-screen image of New York 's Manufacturers Trust Company , with its dignified vice president and two uniformed guards , turned out to be hollow ; the bank had guarded the questions all right , but had only the word of the producers that no one else had seen them . But the implications of the quiz scandals last week went far beyond the guilt or innocence of any individual show or contestant , including Charles Van Doren ( who reappeared after a long , lost weekend in New England , accepted a subpoena to testify when the Washington hearings resume Nov. 2 ) . Growing recognition of the networks ' irresponsibility ( notably their willingness to let packagers control much of their entertainment fare ) put in question the ethics of the television industry in general . For the first time , the U.S. was forced to think about the philosophy that lies behind the picture tube as well as the character of those who sit in front of it . <P> Wrote the Atlanta Constitution 's Ralph McGill : " It is a melancholy business , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us . That so many millions hang on the results of the quizzes , in which sterile parrot knowledge was put to artificial use , was a commentary on our public values . " As if to support McGill 's point , the New York Daily News 's inquiring photographer asked six New Yorkers a $64,000 question : " Would you have any qualms about appearing on a rigged quiz show ? " Answered five out of six : No , I 'd take the money . No amount of public naivete or cupidity could excuse the networks ' lack of responsibility . Said CBS 's Stanton : " As I see it with the benefit of hindsight , we should have been more thoughtful and critical . "
