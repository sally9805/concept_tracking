Last week , having cast Director Laszlo Halasz adrift , the New York City Opera announced a spring season in the best Halasz tradition . In addition to eleven operas from current repertory , it promised productions of i ) Alban Berg 's tragic opera , Wozzeck , which no U.S. audience has seen in 21 years , 2 ) a stage version of Gian-Carlo Menotti 's Amahl and the Night Visitors , and 3 ) a new adaptation , by Marc Blitzstein , of Kurt Weill 's The Three-Penny Opera . Possible hitch : Halasz , who is still fighting his year-end dismissal ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) , contends that , under his last contract , none of last year 's repertory may be produced this year without Halasz on deck .
