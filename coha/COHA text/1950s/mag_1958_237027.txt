For 72 hours last week the world hovered on a brink-not the brink of war but a rare opportunity to take the plunge toward peace . <P> The U.S. was not satisfied with its negative propaganda victory of the week before-compelling Russia to withdraw its U.N . charge that U.S. bomber flights were a " threat to peace . " Now , accenting the positive , Henry Cabot Lodge went before the U.N . Security Council with a proposal to open the top of the world above the Arctic Circle to international inspection to guard against surprise aerial or missile attack . There were no strings attached . Here was an imaginative proposal , to make a start somewhere , and in an area not complicated by populations and boundaries , to break the cold war ice jam . <P> To assure Russia that it was more than a propaganda trick or a play for headlines , the U.S. engaged in the highest form of diplomacy : it told Soviet diplomats about the plan in advance and in secret . In Washington John Foster Dulles called in Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , was " not exactly heart-warming " ) , and in New York Henry Cabot Lodge went up to the Park Avenue residence of Soviet Delegate Arkady A. Sobolev to outline the U.S. offer privately . <P> Then in the U.N. , Lodge stated the case : " Our flights are a necessary defensive measure against massive surprise attack , and it follows , therefore , that if the danger of such attack were removed , the need for this defense could be correspondingly lessened . . . Let us attack the cause of the Soviet concerns-not their symptoms . " The U.S. proposal : the prompt establishment of a northern zone of inspection against surprise attack ( see map ) . <P> Lodge suggested an international inspection force for the Arctic that would provide notification of flights and other significant military movements , radar monitoring of all flights , and establishment of ground-inspection posts . <P> Out of the Nightmare . The proposal won immediate endorsement from other members of the Security Council-such disparate nations as France , Canada , Sweden , Japan , Iraq-and a cool , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week 's most dramatic turn . Sitting to the right of Lodge , who was president of the council , U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold murmured that he would like to speak . <P> None was more startled than Lodge at the Secretary-General 's decision : Hammarskjold had intervened in council debate only twice before-once during the Suez crisis , again when the Russians smashed the Hungarian rebellion . Hammarskjold could recall the fate of Trygve Lie , whose intervention on behalf of the U.N . in Korea had won Lie the hostility of the Russians and cost him the Secretary-General 's post . But , at 52 , Hammarskjold had just been re-elected to a five-year term , and for weeks he had been brooding about the disheartening deadlock over disarmament .
