Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> Speaking to a rapt covey of newshens , Pollster George Gallup , mindful of the time when his prophecies all but installed Thomas E. Dewey in the White House , made it clear that he will crawl out on no limb this election year . Announced hypercautious Dr. Gallup : " As I look into this crystal ball , I see a light flashing and hear a small voice saying , ' Remember 1948 . ' It will be my intention in this campaign simply to use the magic words , ' Let others make the predictions . ' " <P> . . . <P> In Britain , the government and the public executors of the estate of Playwright George Bernard Shaw agreed on the value of his copyrights , thus nearly doubled the provisional worth of his estate that was set in 1951 . The new figure : $1,680,000 , subject to whopping inheritance taxes in the 70% bracket . Meanwhile , G.B.S. 's will was soon to get raked over in court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made a bequest to provide a handsome subsidy to renovate the English alphabet . A hater of diphthongs and illogical pronunciations , Alphabetterer Shaw wanted the ABCs stretched to 40 letters on a one-sound , one-letter plan . Tart-tongued Lady Astor took one look at her old friend 's idea and pronounced it ridiculous . The British Museum , one of Shaw 's three institutional heirs , now wants the court to quash Shaw 's bizarre bequest on the ground that a newfangled alphabet would not benefit the community . If the court concurs , the Museum , along with Ireland 's National Gallery and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts , will start collecting royalties now pouring into Shaw 's estate , plus all that is left of it in 1970 . <P> . . . <P> Practically unrecognizable in his Okinawan getup , Cinemactor Marlon Brando looked uncharacteristically scrutable on a movie location in Japan , where M-G-M is making a film version of Broadway 's long-run ( 1,020 performances ) hit , Teahouse of the August Moon . <P> . . . <P> When A.F.L.-C.I.O . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , bluntly tagged India 's Prime Minister Nehru as a Communist ally ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) , U.S. Ambassador to India John Sherman Cooper sent out a hasty S O S for Meany 's more diplomatic vice president , the Auto Workers ' Walter Reuther , to come soothe the anger of India 's trade unionists . Reuther returned to the U.S. last week after a shining fortnight 's good-will mission . He had sat in as a drummer at a village folk dance , got dolled up in a turban , been festooned with countless flowers , made 118 speeches . In a Calcutta auto plant , he had eaten lunch with the workers instead of in the bosses ' dining room , explaining , " Hell , I would n't eat with them in the States . Why should I eat with them here ? " Onetime ( 1933-35 ) Russian Auto Plant Worker Reuther drew new applause from approving Indians with a well-worn point : " In America the capitalists own the factories but we workers own the automobiles . In Russia , workers may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Despite the personal success of his tour , however , Labor Chief Reuther came home glum : " The gulf of misunderstanding between this country and Asia is widening .
