INDOCHINA <P> The Vietnamese Minister for Information , Le Thang , was helpfully trying to explain the situation in Indo-China as he saw it . " The trouble here , " he said , " is that the average Vietnamese does n't want the U.S. to come in because he 's afraid of atomic bombs . He does n't want the Communists because he 's afraid of China . He does n't want the French to stay because they 're colonialists . He wants a strong Vietnamese government , but not mobilization . He does n't want elections because the Communists might win . "
