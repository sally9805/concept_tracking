1 INT . EMPTY CAFE - NIGHT FADE IN ( This action played in thirty seconds , opens before MAIN TITLES appear on the screen . ) BOOM SHOT  --  HIGH CAMERA HOLDS to show a deserted , cellar night club . It 's a barn-like structure , dark melancholy , the hour late . A storm threatens outside , suggested by an occasional rumble of THUNDER and splashes of lightning through a skylight which is apparent but which we do not see . ( Actually , this set is no more than one of our big , empty stages and exciting lighting effects . ) CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY , halfway down and around to another ANGLE . There are four or five tables stacked with upturned chairs , half revealed in the semi-darkness . At the furthermost point in the shot , we barely discern a man sitting at the PIANO tapping out the tune " One More For The Road , " with one finger . We hear the man and feel his presence more clearly than we actually see him . A tumbler of whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an eerie quality about both the place and the action . 2 MED . SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE a short flight of stairs , against pitch blackness . CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on a pair of polished shoes descending ; they obviously belong to a well-dressed man who has quietly entered the cafe . Three or four stairs from the bottom , one of the steps creaks under the man 's weight . The shoes stop in mid-action , one foot on a solid step , the other half-withdrawn from the creaking one . The foot sways slightly and points downward . The shadow in polished shoes is wary , pausing to see if the noise alerted the man at the piano . The tapping MUSIC continues uninterrupted . Satisfied of not being heard , the polished shoes continue the descent , carefully by-passing the creaking step . 3 MED . SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE toward man at piano pecking away at the keys .

Suddenly a NOISE startles Yonkers . THAT SAME CREAK of the board on the stairway ! He spins around , his eyes straining to pierce the darkness . He fires a couple of shots in the direction of the stairway . Somebody else is there  --  a witness to his crime ! Panic seizes the killer . We hear MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS from above and then a DOOR at the head of the stairs SLAMS SHUT . Gun still in hand , Yonkers races toward the stairs . The THUNDER from outside fills the room and ominous MUSIC ( full symphonic arrangement of " One More For The Road " ) sneaks in and builds to a crescendo as we DISSOLVE 6 EXT .

CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THE WINDOW , PASSING JOHNNY YONKERS , who is sitting center of the couch , with the window directly at his back . A toy piano is on the low table which is before the couch . Yonkers is one of the vice overlords of the eastern seaboard  --  not a " heavy , " but rather the modern concept of the businesslike gangster . Present in the room but not yet seen is JEREMIAH KERN  --  a prominent , capable , if somewhat shady attorney . Also present in the room , seated back to CAMERA in a high armchair and never actually seen , is a THIRD PARTY . This party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls up from the chair , and by the fact that later remarks are addressed towards the chair . We do not reveal who the third party is , or whether it be man or woman . The room is underlit , in fact what little light there is is directed away from Johnny Yonkers who sits in shadow and whose face is never really seen until he rises ( later ) and steps forward . AS SHOT OPENS the lightning flashes and thunder cracks wide open . THE PULL BACK past Yonkers ' head comes in a moment of darkness  --  then the lightning flashes again , throwing Yonkers ' head into SHARP SILHOUETTE . THE PULL BACK CONTINUES , and we see that Yonkers is tapping out the tune , " One More For The Road "  --  using one finger on the toy piano , just as the murdered man had done on the real piano in the opening shot . CAMERA CONTINUES ITS PULL BACK , until Kern is in immediate f.g. , his face crosslit as he puts papers into his brief case . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that tune  --  it 's getting on my nerves . You 've been playing it for weeks . Lightning flashes , again silhouetting Yonkers who can still be seen beyond on the shadowy couch . He continues to peck out the tune as he says smoothly : &nbsp; YONKERSTwo weeks . Ever since this rain started . It soothes me ... What else can I do ?  --  4  --  &nbsp; KERN ( closing brief case ) You could be figuring where you go next ! Yonkers pauses in his playing , a finger poised above the toy piano notes ... then the finger lifts to signal towards the bar . &nbsp; YONKERSMilk , George ! A COLORED BUTLER , just visible now at the bar , turns away , saying : &nbsp; BUTLERYes , suh ! Now Kern is turning towards Yonkers , CAMERA MOVING IN WITH HIM as he says : &nbsp; KERNI 'm sorry , Johnny , this is the way it is . The District Attorney thinks there was a witness , and he 's determined to produce such a witness at the trial ... ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yonkers looks up from the toy piano , says calmly : &nbsp; YONKERSGo on . &nbsp; KERNYou shot and killed a man named Battaglia  --  &nbsp; YONKERSIn self-defense  --  &nbsp; KERN ( suavely , tongue in cheek ) Naturally  --  naturally . It 's perfectly reasonable that Battaglia pulled a gun on you . But the D. A. is a hard man to Convince . The Butler has brought the milk ...  --  4A  --  &nbsp; YONKERSThank you , George . Kern shrugs as the Butler retires ... &nbsp; KERNWithout a witness , of course he has no case . ( pointedly ) With a witness , your plea of self-defense will be laughable . &nbsp; YONKERS ( across his Milk glass ) I 'm not laughing . &nbsp; KERNNeither is the dead man . ( with suave and quietly dangerous suggestiveness ) But since you say you think you know where this alleged witness is hiding , may I suggest you figure something out  --  while you 're still on bail !

Yonkers points his finger towards the unseen occupant of the chair . &nbsp; YONKERS ( tightly , quickly ) That 's your job  --  but make sure you find the right witness . We 're only guessing who it is  --  we got to be sure . There 's a plane at midnights . Rent a car when you get there . Mingle with the people . Get on friendly terms with our so-called witness ... then make sure it looks like an accident  --  a real accident . Now CAMERA IS MOVING IN to a VERY BIG CLOSE SHOT of Yonkers ' face , as his eyes go towards Kern and he adds :  --  4B  --  &nbsp; YONKERSWhat a hide-out ! No wonder we did n't find it till yesterday . It 's the last place in the world you 'd expect anybody to hide ... SWIFT DISSOLVE 8-11 OMITTED 12 EXT .

The humor leaves her voice and the smile leaves her lips as she asks rather puzzledly : &nbsp; GRAHAMwhy do you say that ? Matt 's tone is casual , but we , the audience , already suspecting him of being Yonkers ' gunmen , will know that he is prying ... &nbsp; HALLETTJust wondered . Matter of fact , I 've wondered quite a lot of things about you . &nbsp; GRAHAMShould I be flattered now ?  --  46  --  He does n't reply , just continues to gaze at her . Her unaccountable feeling of discomfort returns , so she turns towards CAMERA which PULLS BACK to bring a waist- high rock into f.g . She rests her hand on the rock , looking down towards the lake as she asks : &nbsp; GRAHAMWhat sort of things ? &nbsp; HALLETT ( shrugging ) This and that . Paul Adams for example . &nbsp; GRAHAM ( reflectively , still looking down at lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's always around . As he speaks he steps forward , looking down at her where she stands beside the rock . Her eyes have come up to his as she says simply : &nbsp; GRAHAMHe is n't now . &nbsp; HALLETT ( slowly ) No  --  he is n't now . Louise takes a half step back , right against the rock . The fixedness of his eyes is increasing her discomfiture . His voice is quietly insinuating ... &nbsp; HALLETTAnd I 've wondered why you 're working so far away from home . &nbsp; GRAHAM ( unaccountably quick ) You do n't know where I 'm from . &nbsp; HALLETT ( purringly smooth ) Maybe I do . Maybe I worked in a carnival  --  guess your age and home town .  --  47  --  ( watching her fixedly ) Twenty three . New York City . Louise is really on the defensive now ...

With his eyes fixed on her face , Matt whistles one or two bars of the song , " One More For The Road . " We see almost startled apprehension in Louise ' eyes . She breaks in on the whistling ... &nbsp; GRAHAMOne More For The Road  --  &nbsp; HALLETT ( watching her  --  like a cat watching a House ) I wondered what it meant to you  --  and why you stopped dancing  --  All the sense of defensiveness is in Louise ' face and voice again now .

His eyes are still on hers . He has made no movement , no suggestion which could really alarm her ... yet she is alarmed  --  instinctively . Now she talks  --  more for the sake of keeping control of the situation than out of a wish to answer . But her words are halting ... &nbsp; GRAHAMSome tunes  --  start to play on your mind .
