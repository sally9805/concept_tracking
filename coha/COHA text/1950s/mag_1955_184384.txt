Mme. Suzy Volterra , 38 , a pert , blonde Parisian widow , was not exactly a plunger . When her bay colt Phil Drake went to the post for the 176th running of the English Derby at Epsom Downs last week , it had the bright red and white of the Volterra stables on its back and only $56 of Suzy 's money on its nose . With fine French caution , Suzy also bet $14 insurance money on the Aga Khan 's Hafiz II . <P> As Suzy figured it , she was not at Epsom to clean out the bookies . Her husband , the late Leon Volterra , French theater tycoon ( Folies-Bergeres and Casino de Paris ) , had left her well fixed . She wanted to win to wipe out a white lie : Leon had died in 1949 still believing his wife 's report that he owned a Derby winner . That year , the Volterra stables were running Amour Drake , the Derby favorite , and Amour Drake was beaten in a photo finish .

Aside from the hunch players , the crowd had no more . Phil Drake had raced only twice , and won once ; he went off at 100 to 8 . The favorite , at 11-4 , was Acropolis , a handsome colt owned by the grand old lady of English turf , Alice Lady Derby herself . <P> The field broke cleanly on the first try . Downhill to Tattenham Corner , Acropolis was moving well in fourth place ; Phil Drake was slogging along in the pack , 20 lengths behind the leader . Uphill into the stretch , Irish-bred Panaslipper ( 100 to 1 ) charged into the lead on the outside . " I thought I was home and dried , " said Panaslipper 's Jockey Jim Eddery . Then Phil Drake came on . The big-hearted son of Admiral Drake slid past as if the field had slowed to a trot . Suzy Volterra 's red and white silks crossed under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running doggedly in third position : Acropolis . <P> The $52,645 prize money meant as little to Suzy Volterra as the loss of her bet on Hafiz II . She had a winner for her husband 's stables , and that was enough . Back in the saddling area , Alice Lady Derby congratulated her jockey on his fine ride and made brave plans for one more Derby .
