The View from Pompey 's Head ( 20th Century-Fox ) , as Hamilton Basso saw it in his bestselling novel of 1954 , was a rather unnerving spectacle in which the contemporary South looked like a magnolia tundra strewn with discarded Coke bottles . In the picture version , the view is strictly from the cash register , and the focus scrooches down pretty quickly on the kind of hot grits that generally go with the greens Hollywood loves best . <P> The hero ( Richard Egan ) , a Southerner who has " lapsed " to New York , is sent back on legal business to his home town , Pompey 's Head . On the way , he limbers up his lip for both the accent and the girl ( Dana Wynter ) he left behind him . The accent Actor Egan never does quite come to isolate , but the girl he gets alone in a hotel room on his first day in town . <P> When the girl 's husband ( Cameron Mitchell ) , a got-rich peckerhead , finds out about that hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the score . Next day behind a sand dune , Egan has a " soul-shaking experience " with the lady , but Mitchell is victorious in the end . He tells his wife that if she leaves him , she must also leave the old plantation . In the book the plantation was no more than a makeweight for the whole way of life it implied . In the picture it merely looks as if she loves her fun , but oh , that real estate ! <P> <P> Guys and Dolls ( Samuel Goldwyn ; M-G-M ) , as a Broadway musical , had all the vulgar swagger of a fink* with his mink at 4 a.m. on the crosstown , and a lot more salt than the lox in Lindy 's . It was not really Runyon , just as Runyon was not really Broadway , but as a pinstriped fairy tale with garlic on its breath , it made an honest-to-Gotham hit , and it ran for three years . <P> Sold to Sam Goldwyn for a record price of $1,000,000 , Guys and Dolls is now flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite some bad lapses , it is a Sam-dandy of a picture show , a 158-minute blur of unmitigated energy , one of the year 's best musicals . <P> The Hollywood script keeps close to the Broadway book . As the show begins , such assorted knouts , beer-needlers and pete-lousers as Nicely Nicely , Benny Southstreet , Harry the Horse and Angie the Ox are in their customary condition of p.m. panic . " The oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York " is about to sink . Its proprietor , one Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) , can not raise the rent money for a suitably secluded backroom . Happens , however , he runs into Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ) , a curly wolf at all games of chance , and lays the sucker a G he can not make it to Havana , inside 24 hours , with a doll ( Jean Simmons ) named Sarah Brown , from the Save-A-Soul Mission . <P> Sky is accustomed to dolls " wit ' nice teeth and no last names , " so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her company , he promises to deliver twelve of " the Devil 's first-string troops " to prayer meeting come Saturday night . She accepts , but in Havana the track is faster than she expected because Sky puts a hypo in her cow juice . Even so , they are soon lugging in on the preacher for a matrimonial finish .
