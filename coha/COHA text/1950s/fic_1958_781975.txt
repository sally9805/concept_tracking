 | it on the floor , and in a babble of instantaneous commotion everyone moved to the gate . At the gate , in the jeep , sat Kwan , already installed on his bedroll in the back seat . Beside him on another bedroll , sat a second figure swaddled in a shapeless blue cotton gown . As she turned , Baldwin saw it was the woman by the pool . But now he could see her closely . She was in her twenties perhaps , with a broad , round and handsome face , clear and fine of skin , her glossy black hair drawn back thickly to a bun above the nape of her olive neck . It was a good face , strong and calm ; but now Baldwin was annoyed by her presence . She was in his jeep uninvited . " Who is she ? " asked Baldwin . " This is Madame Hung , " said Colonel Li . " Since you are going to Kweiyang , maybe you can take her too . Madame Hung is the wife of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed this summer at Changsha . If you take Madame Hung to Kweiyang in your trucks , she has friends there who will take care of her . " Baldwin was speechless . McNeil had insisted that the one thing to watch out for was women ; that Detached Demolition trucks had to be kept stripped of all Chinese , but especially women . The air-force trucks that had been coursing the highways of East China during the summer retreat had crawled with women  --  hitchhikers , mothers , students , wives of refugees , earning their soft way south and west to safety . McNeil had explained that Detached Demolition carried no one " not because of the V.D. , and there 's plenty of that , but because a lot of these air-force boys get fond of these Chinese women and it fouls up the job . " McNeil would never have let anybody load a woman on his trucks on the way out like this . But Baldwin knew he was stuck . Colonel Li had given him an escort officer ; they had eaten well to- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " together ; they had somehow been woven by the strands of Chinese courtesy into a brief friendship which now he could not repudiate . " What do you want me to say ? " asked Collins , offering no advice . " There 's nothing to say , we 're stuck . Tell him how dangerous the journey may be for her . " The colonel replied that Madame Hung understood how dangerous the trip was , and that it was more dangerous for her to stay . " Thank him for his kindness and let 's get out of here , " said Baldwin . He climbed in behind the wheel , wanting to drive himself , Collins beside him . He turned around and shook hands with Colonel Kwan , nodded to the woman who nodded back . He pressed on the starter and the motor responded ; he felt better . It was an American motor , an American jeep , he could control it , it would move when he thrust in the clutch , it would turn when he turned the wheel . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesies and resistances that had wasted the morning , he felt good just pressing on the gas treadle , and feeling the engine answer as it should . " Good-bye , " he shouted to Colonel Li , " and thanks . " " Good-bye , " said the fat colonel in English . " Good-bye , glorious Americans , China and America is friends . " " Hu ping an ! " said Colonel Li in Chinese and Baldwin recognized that one . He had heard it often . It meant " To the End of the Road , Peace and Safety . " He hoped so . They spun quickly out of the courtyard , down the cart path , onto the main highway , and headed down the slope . " Tell her , " said Baldwin to Collins as they drove , " that  | this is going to be a pretty rugged trip and that we 're all soldiers . Tell her we sleep out in the open . We have to get rid of her . Ask her if she 'd like it if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one moving up the line , we can trade some of our gasoline for a passenger ticket . " Collins turned to the back seat to repeat it all in Chinese . But Madame Hung leaned forward . " Thank you , " she said in perfect English , " thank you . Please do n't worry about me . I know you do n't want me with you but I 'll try not to be a bother . " He was glad he was driving . She could not see the astonishment or embarrassment in his face . He was carrying a woman who spoke English , perfect English . " I did n't mean to be rude , " said Baldwin talking over his shoulder , trying to apologize , " but this is a difficult trip we 're making and we are n't supposed to be carrying women . " She was quiet . Unable to think of anything else , he said : " I 'm sorry about your husband , it 's been a bad summer . " " Yes , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . But it was just as well . He would not try to make friends . They ought to get rid of her . As quickly as possible . There was so much to do . And a woman would be in the way . And the men would not understand . He would not bother to explain her to the men before he put her on the bus . Let Collins explain to the men , he could do it better than anyone else . He saw the team now , as the jeep came down out of the twist at the foot of the hill and approached the bridge through the incessant throng . He pulled the jeep up before the trucks and Michaelson walked over to them , staring curiously at the Chinese colonel and the woman , but addressing himself to Baldwin .  | " We thought they picked you off , " said Michaelson . " We were arguing about whether to go up after you or just take off . Getting late . " " We had trouble at headquarters , clearing the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's move on this bridge right away and then get out . You 've fed , have n't you ? " " Yup . K-rations . " " Fine . Have you figured out what the bridge will take ? " " I figured we want to take out the main span and the piers . Three pressure charges across the center roadbed , maybe twenty pounds apiece , and we drop her in a V-cut . Then I suppose we ought to do the piers , too . Do a wrap-around on them  --  twenty pounds on each face , ten on the sides . " " Good , " said Baldwin . This team could almost operate itself . But it was he who had had to arrange the deal . Aloud , he said , " That 's the way I see it . And put it on time fuse , not primacord . I want to save the primacord . " Colonel Kwan had not spoken to Baldwin since he had placed his finger on Tushan and the ammo dumps on the map in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided in pairs to crawl under the bridge and prepare its soft sandstone pillars for the charge , Colonel Kwan spoke to the sentries on the near end of the bridge and they crossed to join the two sentries on the far side . When they were halfway through the work , Baldwin took Collins with him to speak to the Colonel , who was silent and stiff as he watched the Americans at their work . " We 'll be ready to blow in half an hour , " said Baldwin to Kwan . " Will you have the sentries stop the passengers and hold up the flow a couple of hundred yards from the other side before we set it off ? " Kwan nodded and went off to post himself on the other side . Now and then a Chinese truck would roll along ; people  | continuously walked by , trudging unhappily on their way , but the Americans had been numbed by the procession now and no longer noticed . Baldwin took off his shirt in the warm afternoon sun and went out to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to work his body . The orange-colored fuse cord , unwinding through his fingers , felt greasy but substantial ; it was a good feel after the subtleties of the morning . They were through with the wiring by three-thirty and ready to blow . Baldwin checked the connections himself , walked back to the trucks , looked around , consulted with Colonel Kwan . Kwan pointed with his finger to the far side of the bridge and there , very high , on the road that wound its way down the valley , was a bus . It was coming down slowly on brakes , coasting . They waited as this last bus out of the lowlands slowly grew larger , slowly came nearer . We can blow the bridge now , thought Baldwin to himself , with Kwan 's authority and mine , and the bus will be stuck there on the other side for years , or until the war is over , or until the Japanese take it . But we 'll give the bus ten minutes more to come down , and cross over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kweiyang tomorrow or the next day and never know we let them through . The bus chuffed down to the bridge , the driver pounding the outside of the tin door to warn of his coming . With a swish of the stinking vegetable oil its diesel engine was burning , the driver snapped the engine on as it passed them , and then began the crawl up the ridge that lay ahead of them . " O.K. now , " said Baldwin to Kwan , and Kwan shouted to the sentries on the far side . The four sentries spread themselves across the road and began to walk slowly away from the bridge , herding the uneven procession of stragglers backward before them . Up the hill on the other side of the bridge ,  | as far as Baldwin 's eye could see , they stretched in ones , in twos , in groups , in clots , all winding down toward the valley and the bridge he was about to cut . They would see the bridge go up from where they walked , an eruption of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he was doing it ? Did they know that Americans were doing it ? If they knew Americans were doing it , would it make any difference after the burnings , and bombings , and flights of the months and years past ? Baldwin looked down at the river bed in the ravine . It was ankle-deep , the water clear-green with its fall purity . No wheeled vehicle would cross this unless the Japs could bring up something like a Bailey bridge . But none of the stragglers would have any trouble wading it on foot  --  un less they were sick or old . But he could not think about that , . He found Michaelson beside him . " Ready ? " he asked . " All set , " said Michaelson . " O.K. , let it go , " said Baldwin . Michaelson knelt to the pale-orange length of safety fuse , snipped it and frayed the end , then rose to give the call . Then he knelt again and touched his cigarette lighter to the fuse . The end of the fuse sputtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it wriggled with great deliberation down its length to the bridge in a convulsion of twisting and spitting and the charges , with an echoing , banging slam , went off . The log beams of the bridge cracked from their supports , plunging down into the water , the planking falling after them with a clatter . At the same moment , the stone piers heaved and shuddered , then crumbled like a child 's building blocks being swept away by a casual flick of the hand . If Li holds the position this will stop the advance Jap element for a day , two days , Baldwin told himself . If Li abandons the position , then how long will it take for the Jap to  | bridge it again ? Longer than it took us to blow ? he asked himself . But how did one count time  --  it had taken little more than an hour to destroy the bridge . But it had taken most of the day to arrange for the blowing . It was not the substance of things , he realized again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arranging of them , the deal . Imperceptibly , the day had slipped from his control . They had come only twenty miles . They had ripped out one little bridge . It was already late afternoon and growing sharply chilly . The hours had been lost up there on the hill with Colonel Li , in China . Ile had eaten too much , drunk too much , and he was stuck with a woman whom now he had to get rid of . " Let 's load and get out , " he shouted at the men in a large voice . They were loaded already , he noticed , as he shouted . They , too , knew the day was lost . Sullenly , in a knot , neither talking nor chattering , they waited for him by the jeep . They climbed into their cabs as Baldwin dismissed them and when the jeep started , the convoy rolled . As they ground up the hill again , they were catching the night wind from the highlands ; the sun was sinking , the sky had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was cold . The traffic on the road , the endless chain of people , was thinning now , for the cold was thinning it , and Collins , at the wheel , held the gears back , trying not to separate the jeep from the four trucks behind as the gaps opened before him . Halfway up the hill , Collins cursed : " Damn it , " he said , " there 's a block . " Baldwin had noticed it , too . The big bus , the last to cross the bridge , was just ahead of them , planted squarely in'the middle of the road , leaving barely enough room for the single  | jeep to sidle by . There would be no room for the big trucks behind . Collins ' foot came down squarely on the brake pedal , the jeep stopped , Collins turned off the ignition . Behind them , the other four trucks ground to a halt , too . Baldwin and Collins got out without saying anything to each other . Kwan unbent and stepped out with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchange at the bridge , but Baldwin noticed that he did not have to be asked . He came on his own , the same speechless disgust that moved Baldwin showing on Kwan 's face , too . The three strolled forward to see what was happening . In front of the bus , to the side of the road , lay a mule , its load of long timbers still lashed to its back , bleeding and hoarsely roaring and screeching . Baldwin had never heard a mule make a sound before , and the agonizing , whistling braying from the beast was almost human in its pitch . One of the bus 's headlights was shattered , and Baldwin could almost guess what had happened . The bus with its horn blaring had startled the mule carrying the timbers ; the mule had probably swung wildly in surprise or fright , and , as it swung , the protruding end of the timbers must have hit the headlight , breaking the glass , and knocking the mule over to the side of the road where it lay bleeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pranced at the sound of engines or horns . What Baldwin could not understand was what was now happening . A man in dirty , peasant blue was kneeling on the ground , sobbing and wailing . His body rose and fell as he swayed back and forth , knocking his head to the road in the jackknifing , bobbing motion of the h'o-t'ou . And every time he bent his head to the ground , he was kicked . The uniformed bus driver and another uniformed man were yelling at him ; and each time the man brought his head to earth , they kicked  | it with their boots in the nose , the mouth , the eyes , and it was beginning to bleed , and under the blood it was probably pulp . A boy of fourteen or fifteen was kneeling on the ground beside the blue-gowned peasant , crying , howling , pleading in total terror . " What 's happening ? " Baldwin asked Collins . " I do n't know , " said Collins , but Kwan had taken over . He had marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . They turned to Kwan , and , their faces still hardened in rage , stopped kicking and began to expostulate . The peasant and his son turned to Kwan also , their fingers cupped beneath their chins for mercy and began to cry to him . The uniformed man pointed to the broken headlights and the shattered glass , pointed to the mule by the side of the road , pointed to the crying couple . Kwan 's voice modulated from the bellow to an icy cold , a clipped , harsh interrogatory . " Kwan 's stopping it , " said Collins . " They say this mule broke the headlight . They say they 're sorry . I ca n't catch all that Kwan is saying . He 's telling the peasants they 're wrong . Ile 's telling them they 're interfering with the national defense , now he 's telling the driver that the army should n't beat up on the people . " Gradually , the talk began to simmer down . The driver and his helper climbed back into their bus which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an army bus , loaded with women and children . They must be headquarters ' families from somewhere , being sent ahead to safety . The peasant and his son went over to the mule , trying to tug it to its feet , now coaxing , now scolding it . Collins walked over to see the animal . He came back quickly . " Scratch one mule . They 'll never get that one on its feet again . "  | " What did they say ? " asked Baldwin . " , I ca n't follow any of these local dialects . I suppose that wipes them out . The family 's capital was probably in that mule . " The bus had ground under way again , and Kwan , Baldwin and Collins walked back to their jeep . When the convoy rolled forward again it was dark . Again and again , Baldwin had noticed this happen when he traveled . As the day deepened on the road , as the sun slanted , as the hours wore long and the light faded , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side of the break was daylight and you could reach back to morning . Then , sharply , after the break , it was dark , it was evening , it was time to stop , to rest , to eat . He wondered how a drink would taste . They had come to the crest of the hill and the black night lay before them . Their headlights picked up few wanderers now , but they traveled slowly . It was cold , too cold to sleep in the open unless they had to , and Baldwin asked Collins to ask Kwan if he knew the country . " The road is level now for about twenty li , " reported Collins . " That 's about six miles . We pass through Ishan and then come the mountains . But before we come to the mountains there 's a place called Hwaiyuanchen , a big village . He says we should stay there tonight and not cross the next range in the darkness . " They pushed through Ishan in the early evening and another half hour brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trucks , buses , an old sedan , animals , people , bustled and surged as forms detached themselves , crossing and recrossing , momentarily visible and vanishing , in the twinkling bonfires that the refugees had built on the cobbled main street for warmth . In the hard light of the jeep 's headlights , people 's faces turned up to stare , pale , blank ,  | curious . Some darted out of the way as if jabbed by the surprise and pain of the light ; others dragged themselves heavily to the side as if nothing could make them move faster . It was as if the jeep 's lights had pried up a huge boulder of dark under which a squirming tangle of flesh writhed ; or as if , in a dark hall , a light had been flashed to reveal it full and pulsing with a thousand intimacies . The convoy slowed , and behind the jeep , Baldwin could hear the trucks blasting with their horns ; the men were tired , too . Kwan finally spoke . " In a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li 's regiment has a transport post . We can stay there . " And in a few more minutes he said , " Here we are . " It was easy now . With Kwan to smooth the way for him , Baldwin could handle things . His spirits began to rise again . A large room , on one side of what appeared in the dark to be the courtyard of an inn , was cleared away for the Americans . Chinese soldiers brought two large iron charcoal braziers , and as the charcoal began to glow , the room warmed . Two oil lamps were brought , and as the yellow flames fluttered they began to see each other again . Miller had brought in a gallon can of the pork-and-gravy and a carton of the five-in-one ration . Kwan spread his Chinese quilt-roll in a corner , excused himself from the Americans and said he would go to speak to the commander of the transport post . No , he was not hungry , he said , and left . Slowly , as the food began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . If he were going to get rid of her , it was best to be firm about it , and now . She had already spread her quilt in one of the corners of the room away from the men and was sitting , watching them , self-contained . Baldwin was aware of her dignity as he went over to join her . " You 'll eat with us , I hope , " he said . " We have plenty , "  | as if he were asking an uninvited guest to stay for dinner . " Thank you , " she said . Her voice was proud , yet resigned , and again he was impressed by the perfect American-tonality of the voice coming out of the shapeless swaddle of the padded gown . It might almost be from New England , he told himself . " You can use my mess kit , " he said , and then , " You do eat American food , do n't you ? " Some Chinese , he knew , did not . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used to eat American all the time . But I have my own bowl , thank you , I do n't want to bother you . " She rummaged in her bedroll and came up with an enameled Chinese rice bowl and some chopsticks . Baldwin was still trying to place her voice . There was something of Helen in it , not just the home sound , but the way she made him feel uncomfortable . He unslung his mess kit and together they walked over to the cooking . Miller ladled out two big helpings into Baldwin 's mess kit and Baldwin reached down , took some of the hard crackers and added them to the stew to sop up the gravy . He stooped again , took another handful of crackers , offered them to her , and when she nodded , he put them on her rice bowl , brimming with Miller 's helping of stew . He was conscious it was slum , and aware that she made him feel that way . " Want to join us here ? " Baldwin asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her corner . Baldwin hesitated , then followed her . It was best to get it over with right away and he squatted beside her , munching away . He waited for her to say something , to give him an opening , and when she did not , he said , hoping he sounded polite : " Would n't you be more comfortable if we put you on a Chinese bus ? "  | " If you want to put me on a bus , do it , " she replied , with no give in her voice at all . He began again : " Well , I did n't mean to sound harsh . But we have three or four days of work , perhaps , to do on this road before we get to Kweiyang . There 's no telling what will happen . If we could get you on a passenger bus , you 'd go right on through . " " Have you ever been on a Chinese bus ? " she countered . " No , " he said . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " They flew me in last week . Special job . " " You need protection at one end or the other , " she said . " After Changsha fell , my husband 's officers put me on a bus down to Hengyang . We went only ten miles before the driver stopped the bus and asked everyone for more money , for himself . I paid him . But he threw a woman and child who had no money off and made them walk . " " I thought there were trains for officers ' families , " said Baldwin , puzzled . " I did n't know anybody in Hengyang , so I bought a ticket on a refugee train down to I. , iuchow . " She made no further reference to her husband and Baldwin did not want to press it . " Have you ever seen a refugee train ? " she asked . " No , " he said . " They built platforms in the refugee trains so that people could lie down in three tiers . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people dying , and a woman had a baby in the tier just above me . It was better than being on the roof though . There were people on all the roofs , holding on with their fingers , and our train went through a tunnel just before it came into Kweilin and you could hear the people on the roof being scraped off in the tunnel because it was so  | low , and they were screaming and shouting , and I never knew it was like that . I 'd always been with my husband on a retreat . When we came out of the tunnel , the engineer stopped the train , and we all went out to get some air . There was an old man still lying on the top of one of the cars , bleeding . I saw a student , a handsome-looking boy , lift the man 's head up by the hair and look at his face . Then he pushed the old man off the roof and lay down in his place . " " What happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dead , " she said , and went on , " I sold my watch in Liuchow to get food and then I located Colonel Li . Li was a student of my husband 's at the military academy when the Central government was trying to train Kwangsi officers . I 've been with his regiment ever since , at his headquarters . If Li 's regiment had a bus , he might have put me on it . But it did n't . He told me I 'd be safer with you . " Baldwin , never adept at the game of parlor psychology , knew that fundamentally she was begging . He wondered if she realized it , too . Her voice did not show it . She was not pleading . It would be difficult to put her out on the road after hearing her story . But he did not want to yield at once , either . " It 's a rough country , is n't it ? " he said . " You do n't like it , do you ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why no , as a matter of fact I like China , " he added , wondering whether he was denying what might well be true . In spite of himself , her story had shaken him , and he thought of the bloody peasant they had just rescued from the army bus . " Except . . . I 'll never really understand the brutality ? that peasant with his mule being beaten up like that . " " The bus driver was furious , " she said . " Kwan told me about it . The driver will have to pay for a new headlight out of his wages ; it may cost him a year of his pay . You see , no-  | body trusts drivers . They steal all the time  --  gasoline , tires , anything . If they 're short when they report , they have to pay up or be flogged . That 's why he was beating the peasant . Was he badly hurt ? " She might have been explaining a lesson to a child , her voice cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell with a Chinese , " he said . Her voice had made him forget that she too was Chinese , but now abruptly , she turned . " Oh , what makes you say that ? " she said , her voice rising for the first time . " Because he 's Chinese ? Because he was knocking his head on the ground ? Because he 's a native ? " " I did n't mean it that way , " said Baldwin trying to draw back from this woman who was suddenly all thorn and prickle . " I know what you nican , " she said . " I 'm sorry , " he said , trying to cut it off , remembering her husband had been killed for China and women were emotional . " I only meant that I could n't speak Chinese . " he wanted to get away from her now , but he did not mean to leave her thinking of hint like that . Doggedly , he groped his way back to the original purpose of the conversation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy , " it seems you should n't have to hitch-hike like this . I suppose it 's just that the retreat disorganized everything . But a general 's wife . . . I mean . ... " he knew it sounded pompous , but went on , " I mean provision should be made to take care of a general 's wife . . . " " T'ung-ling was shot , " she said . " I know , I 'm sorry , " said Baldwin softly . " He was executed , " she added , tonelessly , explaining . " What ? " he said , not believing he had heard . " We lost Changsha . And the senior officers were executed , " she said , dropping her voice , closing the subject .  | He could say nothing now that made sense as his mind tried to put the fragments together . Her husband had been executed by the government . Li had foisted her on him . He wanted to be rid of her , and who was she ? He looked around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he could trust Kwan or anyone . But even Kwan would serve as an excuse for leaving her . He rose from the bedroll , abruptly , knowing his shock must show to her , and said , " I have to speak to Kwan , he may have some news . " Still dazed , he beckoned Collins , and approached Kwan . The officer 's face was cold , stiff , ungiving . " There is no more telephone to the 212th regiment , " said Kwan , when Collins asked for information . " What happened to it ? " asked Baldwin . " Colonel Li has gone to the hills , " replied Kwan . " But . . . " stammered Baldwin , " I thought he was going to hold . He was dug in . " Kwan stared at him . " Colonel Li is very brave . He was wounded twice by the Japanese when the Kwangsi brigades fought in Shanghai . They fought well . But they are not Central troops . Central troops stay to the end . For Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills for this winter . He is from Kwangsi . " From Kwan 's calm voice , Baldwin gathered that he must have known of Li 's plan even before they had left the regimental command this afternoon . It had all been an act  --  the banquet , the speeches , the mock heroics . Kwan continued , " And the Japanese are in Liuchow . They entered this afternoon . They are following . That is why Colonel Li left . " So the Japs were on their heels again . And he had all but wasted the day , taking out a bridge which Japanese cavalry could probably ford now that Li had left , and eating a banquet  | that he did not want , and acquiring a woman who might get them in trouble . There should be something to show after a day like this . And there was nothing . Somehow he had failed . " How far is it to Tushan ? " he asked of Kwan , and Collins relayed from Kwan not an answer but a question . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to cut this road tomorrow , either near here or near Hochih , " he replied . " It is one hundred twenty-five miles from Tushan , " said Collins , translating the Chinese figures . " It is one day if we drive all day he says , but several days if we must stop and work . He says it is better to stop near Hochih to destroy the road , than to stop in the morning near here . Japanese patrols may be coming . And they will want to go to Tushan , fast , too , for the ammunition . " Baldwin reflected that he would have to decide it all by himself . He could not trust anybody now . His command , his decision , and he had made no gain today . Without replying to Kwan he closed the conversation . " We 'd better all turn in , " he said . " We 've got a full day 's work tomorrow . " He would make tomorrow count , no matter what . The men were already sleeping , curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Dangerous , that charcoal , Baldwin thought , throws off carbon monoxide . He scanned the ill-fitting doors , sensed the draft of cold air leaking through the cracks in the badly jointed walls . There would be enough fresh air , no danger . Ile looked around the room once more and saw she was still sitting on her bedroll , looking at him . In the charcoal 's glow , he saw her hair glistening , and the light reflecting off her high , smooth cheekbones , making pale her throat and her eyes dark . When she saw him return the  | gaze , her head drooped ; she had shut him out . He knew he resented her ; she made him feel awkward ; she was an unknown quantity . But he could not see how he could put her out now to walk on the road .  | CHAPTER 4 The Cotton Truck IT WAS WINTER when they woke next morning in the heights . The sun had vanished as if it had never shone . The clouds weighed thick and gray above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them tight , seeping in under the woolens , slowing their bodies , stiffening but not quite numbing their fingers . From the moment Michaelson climbed into his truck , he knew it was going to be a bad day . Prince had told him Lewis was sick , and Michaelson had said , Let me warm up my job first and I 'll look at him . But he could not warm up the sullen six-by-six . The truck 's engine turned slowly through its piston chambers , sucking helplessly on the tired battery ; yel the motor would not catch . Cold , thought Michaelson , and it 's going to get colder and they 're sticky with summer oil . He climbed down in anger from the cab and yelled Miller over .  | Then he lifted the hood and jiggled the fuel pump delicately ; when he judged the chambers were filled with just enough vapor , he told Miller to crank it up and got back into the cab . Miller turned the engine stiffly through a few turns and , on the second try , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few minutes with the gas treadle , then gradually fed it more gasoline until it was roaring in full-hearted vigor . Then he cut it back , letting it idle , and turned to see how the other trucks were doing . They were all having trouble , but twq would not start at all . Then Baldwin was approaching him . " Trouble ? " asked Baldwin . " Yup , trouble , " said Michaelson . " Lewis is sick and two of the six-by-sixes wo n't start . " " What 's the matter with Lewis ? " " I do n't know . He 's got a fever . They 're all tired out . Maybe he 's just worn down . " " Serious ? " " I have n't looked at him yet . Maybe it 's that malaria of his come back . But you ca n't tell with Lewis . " They both stood there , two men pondering a problem . Lewis was strictly sad sack . If they had to hike , it was Lewis ' sock that rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes bit at night , they bit through Lewis ' net which was torn . Lewis had had malaria all the way down the retreat from Hengyang in July to Kweilin in October , and had stuffed so much atabrine into himself that his face had stained to saffron yellow . He had also , naturally , poisoned himself with atabrine overdose . Something in Chinese food made Lewis ' face and lips puff , so Lewis ate only from GI cans . A fullblown hypochondriac , Lewis would long since have been shipped back to base at Kunming , except for the fact that he did not want to go . Lewis liked being with Detached Demoli-  | tion which was home to him in the confusing army ; and , Detached Demolition needed him because he was a licensed electrician who had learned his trade in Cleveland and the cunning of his fingers with wires and circuits made him indispensable to the team . They did not need him now for what remained to be done , and it would have been smarter to have sent him out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they would have Lewis sick on their hands for the rest of the trip . " Well , I 'll go look at him , " said Baldwin . " What about those two trucks ? " " Just the frigging cold . You know something  --  we should have figured on it . The batteries are all fried out from summer , we bring them up here in the cold and they have no juice . Prince 's job turns a little bit , if we push her she 'll start . Lewis ' job is cold as stone , all frozen up ; we 'd have to thaw her out first and then push her , and then maybe she 'll crap out on us for good when we get to the first upgrade . " " How long to get them turning ? " Michaelson reflected . Fifteen minutes anywhere back home to get a truck started . But here ? In China ? " An hour , maybe more . Depends on the luck . " " An hour , " said Baldwin frowning . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly the Japanese were following up out of Liuchow . And yesterday had been fouled up . Today he had to get enough distance between them to turn and do something to the road . But he could not abandon a truck just because it was cold . " All right , " he finally said . " We 'll give it the hour . You work on Lewis ' truck , and I 'll have Prince 's truck pushed on the road so we can start it . I 'll get some Chinese soldiers to help you . I 'll look after Lewis myself . " There was no trouble with Prince 's truck . Kwan assembled enough soldiers of the transport post to hand-push it into the  | street , and a shove from another six-by-six spun its engine handily into action . But Lewis ' truck was stone-cold , cumbersome and helpless on the flagstoned paving of the Chinese courtyard . Irritably , Michaelson settled into the job of starting it . Over the hood of the cold engine , the men draped a tarpaulin ; under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braziers so that the heat , rising , could thaw the cold-congealed cylinders . Michaelson noticed , with a grunt of satisfaction , that Ballo had brought a handful of used spark plugs from his own cab and was now filing the points . It would take fifteen or twenty minutes to warm the engine enough to give it a chance ; and with fresh plugs , perhaps it would go . But meanwhile .. . Meanwhile , the soldiers of the transport post had gathered in a knot about the Americans working on the truck , gawking and staring at the new entertainment . Through the gates of the open courtyard , Michaelson could see little boys , young men , curious strangers all crowded about for a look at the strange tinkering of the Americans . The children laughed and jeered at them and Michaelson 's temper began to simmer as they laughed . He had once asked Collins what Chinese kids yelled at the Americans , and Collins had said Chinese kids thought Americans were funny and called them " Big Nose ; " or " Hairy Legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated the way anywhere they had stopped on the road this summer , a crowd had instantly bubbled up about them to pry , to comment , to laugh , to watch . He did not want them close to him , nor anywhere around . This morning their faces rubbed his nerves raw . This truck had to start , to show them it was American . He did not like the woman at the courtyard door holding the cackling chicken by its bound legs , head-down ; nor the Chinese soldiers good-naturedly commenting on their work ; nor the edging and shoving about the gate .  | Nor did Michaelson like the way Ballo was clowning it . Ballo had begun to file the plug points , and was brandishing the plugs high in the sky to examine them , stroking them with his file in an arm-sweeping flourish , gagging it for the mystified Chinese audience . Ballo fingered one of the plugs , muttered , " No damn good , " then flung it aside . Three Chinese soldiers , laughing , scrambled after it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " said Ballo , but Michaelson lost his temper . " Gallo , goddam it , I keep telling you guys , do n't fool around with them ! " " What 's the matter ? " asked Ballo , astonished . " I just do n't want them close to us , I keep telling you . These people are dangerous . " Ballo shrugged and went back to work on the plugs . Prince spoke . " What 's the matter , Mike , you nervous ? " " I 'm nervous  --  so what ? Those Japs are on the road already , and we 're stuck here in this Chinese crowd , and we 've got to get this job rolling , or we 're going to be trapped . " " That frigging Lewis , " replied Prince languidly , " would n't you know it 'd be his truck that conks out . Give you three to two odds that Lewis is goofing off on us , soon as we get back to Kunming he 's all right again ? " Michaelson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Make you another  --  this joker Baldwin 's gon na get us all in trouble . Bet you two-to-one before we see Kweiyang , we 'll have a real run-in with these slopey bastards . We ought to ditch this truck , and barrel on right out , now . " " This truck 'll go , " growled Michaelson . " Quit yakking . " He judged now that the weak charcoal warming pans might have begun to take effect and ordered the tarpaulin off . He  | backed his own truck around into the courtyard gate again , opened its hood and began to connect some wires from his own battery to the dead battery on Lewis ' truck . A Chinese soldier reached to touch one of the clamp-on terminals . Michaelson yelled at him , " Get the hell out of there , " and the Chinese jumped back . The other Chinese laughed uproariously , and the soldier he had yelled at scowled . " Goddam bunch of monkeys , " growled Michaelson , " they 'll eat anything , touch anything , screw anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quickly and efficiently , Michaelson now clamped the wires from his own engine to the dead battery of the Lewis truck and snapped on the ignition . Lewis ' truck roared alive and Michaelson felt good ; he had shown them . The Chinese cheered , clapping their hands as at the climax of a play , and Michaelson found himself smiling at them , then closed it off . The Chinese kept laughing , and the soldiers who now pulled the charcoal fires back from under Lewis ' truck , looked very proud , almost strutting . They lifted their thumbs in the Ting Hao gesture , and Michaelson realized that they must feel they had helped . Partners . Ile looked at his watch . It had taken only twenty-five minutes ; he felt better . Awkwardly , the big six-by-six nosed its way out of the compound and fell into line . Michaelson hopped out of the car and went forward to see Baldwin . " All set , " he said . " Fine , " said Baldwin , " nice work . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? " asked Michaelson . " No , he 's sick , " said Baldwin . " I 've fixed him up on some bedrolls , and he 's lying down in back of Ballo 's truck . We 'll let him ride that way today and keep him warm back there under the blankets . We 'll take another reading on him to-  | night ; I doctored him with aspirin and atabrine . Look , Mike , I 'm changing convoy order today . Niergaard takes the wheel on Lewis ' truck . You and Miller bring up the rear in your truck . " Michaelson did not like riding tail on the convoy . But he walked back to his truck , joined Miller and waited for the signal . Baldwin stood up in the jeep , lifted his arm for the signal , sat down and the jeep rolled . They were off finally , late as usual . " Is Lewis really sick ? " asked Miller of Michaelson as they jounced along in the cab . " I guess so , " said Michaelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd kick his pants off myself . " " Yeah , kick his pants off , " said Miller , the echo . " But he is n't , he 's just a sad sack . " " Yeah , sad sack . " " There 's one in every outfit , " continued Michaelson beginning to unwind , now they were off . " You take the foundry I used to work in on the South Side . We had this hillbilly come to work there once  --  you know we 're getting a lot of these hillbillies in Chicago , now ; they come up from the South for the heavy jobs , the way the Negroes do . Well , this fellow cuts his arm the first day , a big gash all the way up the elbow . I was shop steward then so I had to take it up through the grievance machinery . Then one day he spoiled a plate-mold , next time he spilled a pot of hot iron ; finally one day he spilled a pot of the melt and it damn near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just burned the whole shoe and the inside of it right off  --  hell of a thing to look at . Stank like a piece of burned meat . When they fired him , we did n't say a thing . A foundry 's too dangerous a place to have a sad sack . Accident-prone is what they call those guys . Union never defends an accident-prone man . "  | " Yeah , a guy ought to be able to take care of himself . " " Only you ca n't fire a guy in the army . You 're stuck with him . They should have screened Lewis out before they sent him overseas , kept him at some base back home . He 's a hell of a good electrician but he 's not worth a damn outdoors . And I think this time he 's really got it . " " What do you think he 's got , Mike ? " " It 's either that malaria of his come back again , or something he ate . Or maybe he 's just had it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up into the hills , you 're ready to catch anything , and if anybody in this outfit catches anything , it always has to be Lewis . " " You 're right about that weather , back home in Bridgeport we got this funny weather . Bridgeport 's real nice , but in the fall sometimes it 'll be hot as a furnace one week and the next . . . " Michaelson rode directly over Miller 's talk as if Miller had been mumbling to himself . He always did . Miller was n't important . " What we ought to do is get Lewis back fast and turn him over to the hospital in Kunming . We all ought to get back fast . " " You tell that to Baldwin this morning , Mike ? " " He knows . " " What did he say ? " " He did n't say anything . Went around to look at Lewis , said he was sick , said we 'd wait until tonight and see how Lewis is and how far we get . Maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor either . I figure Baldwin 'll have to do something if he ai n't better tomorrow . " " You going to talk to him about it again , tonight ? " " Listen , for Christ 's sake , Miller , turn it off . Baldwin 's run-  | ning this outfit , not me . I 'm just a god-damned sergeant , not a wet-nurse . " " Yeah , sure , you 're not a wet-nurse , I just asked . " " O.K. , " said Michaelson , turning off the conversation as if he were snapping a switch . Michaelson was irritated again . He realized he was losing his temper too easily . But he could n't help it , he thought . I 've got a right to be tired , too . And they 're all slobs . Big fat Miller 's a slob , Prince is a slob , Niergaard 's a slob . Only Baldwin 's not a slob , and Collins is n't either . I suppose they think I 'm a slob , he said to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bitterness came welling up in him , choking . I 'm not a goddam wet-nurse , he told himself , let Baldwin handle it . Let him handle the whole thing . I 'll make it out safe to Kweiyang . But there 'll be trouble . And that Lewis , what am I supposed to do about him ? Miller thinks I should talk to Baldwin tonight , but this is the Army , and I 'm not a shop steward in the union . I 've had that union crap , I 've had that up to here . Michaelson shifted on the seat , reached in his pants pocket , felt for the pack , thumbnailed a cigarette out , put it to his lips , waited for Miller to give him the light , puffed , blew out again . Why should I ? he reasoned . I 'm through sticking my neck out ; that 's the only thing I learned from the union , and the anger took him again . For he had believed in unions once , when they shoved the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights , the time he let the cop have it with a baseball bat , and the guys getting shot down at the Carnegie Works , and ten hours a day for twenty-five bucks a week , and then they had the union . Stick together , " Solidarity Forever . " " Nobody 's going  | to take care of us unless we all take care of each other . " " One man alone does n't count . " Stick together . And they made it . And then , after it 's all over , after the picket lines , after the fights , after being hungry , after sticking your neck out , then you 're a shop steward . But somebody else who 's never seen a melt , or smelled the sulfur , or never tapped a furnace , sometimes somebody who 's never been in a mill at all , those guys all of them sitting behind the union desks . Lawyers writing contracts . Guys with white collars running the show , big shots from Washington staying at the Palmer House , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economists and college boys interviewing you as if they were doctors , taking twice your pay out of the union payroll , looking at you as if you 're a slob . And you 're a shop steward with all the other slobs nagging you , whether they got an ingrown toenail or tuberculosis you 're supposed to do something about it : " Can you fix vacation for me in October because the ducks start coming over my old man 's farm about then and I want to get in a little shooting ? " " Can you fix it to switch me to the nightshift for just a couple of weeks , I think my wife 's cheating and I want to give her a little rope and come home some night and catch her ? " " The foreman yelled at me , can you do something about it ? " " Say , Mike , I figure I got a right to work on the new four-stand roll they 're putting in , I been here ten years and I got seniority . " . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because they bought protection with their two bucks a month union dues , and you 're the guy who has to pay ofLYou.got to have unions all right , but it 's they who 've got to have them , only the slobs . So you go to night school at the plant and they train you for a foreman . You learn about high-carbon , low-carbon , about job-ratings and work loads , and then you 're a foreman , you 're no longer a union man . But where does it get you  --  fifteen  | bucks a week more . The union 's got it fixed now so there 's no Percentage being a foreman . You 're still a slob . You come in once a week to the plant superintendent 's office in the yard , you listen to the engineer explain the new process , the super spells it out to you as if you were too dumb to understand English , and then you spell it out to the men . Where does it get you ? Then the Army , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to save some money and think things over . It does n't matter where you come from : You 're either one of them or you 're a slob . Or you 're in between and you 've got to make it on your own , take care of yourself . Even in the Army . Now take Baldwin . Baldwin was going to be an officer from the day his old man brought him home from the hospital , he was one of them . And Collins , with his father a politician he was one of them even though he was n't an officer . He could have gone to officers ' training and come out with a bar , but he was having himself a good time when he went to ASTP . But Collins was moving , even though he was a kid . Some day he 'd be a lawyer or a newspaperman , or get on civil service . And all the rest of them were slobs , with himself still in between . Come to think of it , a hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been foremen just like him . And what was a foreman , or a six-striper anyway but a goddamned in-between . They make up their mind upstairs what they want , then they tell Baldwin , then Baldwin tells me . Then it 's up to me to keep the men together , to tell Baldwin how to get the job done . All through the summer , even with McNeil , that 's the way it had been , stuck in between , getting hammered from on top , hammering at the men . Get off your butt , get your back into it , stick together , do n't get separated , nobody 's goofing off today . Or : Major , we 'd better lay over , the guys need some sleep ; or , we 'll need six men for  | that job , Major , two guys ca n't do it alone ; let 's turn them loose in Kweilin for the weekend , Major , they 've got a load in their pants , let them work it off . Still , even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis gets sick . . . . Somebody was going to have to take care of Lewis . Baldwin was a good guy , as those kind of guys go , maybe soft . But he had orders in his pocket . These quiet guys take the job seriously . The road-blowing was more important to Baldwin than anyone being sick . But if Lewis is really sick we ought to high-tail it back to Kunming and the hospital ... . ... Hell ! We ought to be high-tailing it back to Kweiyang and Kunming anyway ; this trip is crazy , the whole goddam idea is crazy . If Lewis is worse tonight , the slob . . . then Baldwin ought to do something about it . If Baldwin could n't see it , he ought to be told . ' 11here 'll be trouble . So Michaelson around and around to himself . But out loud , in exasperation , as he saw the convoy slowing down , he burst out : " Those goddam Chinese ! " They were in traffic now , the traffic they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic was at its midmorning peak . Up ahead , the lead jeep was slowing down , edging to the side of the road to get by two Chinese trucks . Both Chinese trucks had stopped , one of them with its engine still running , the other resting on two tireless front rims as several Chinese worked on the jacked-up rear , stripping the tires . " We give them this stuff and they ruin it . That 's a new weapons-carrier , " Michaelson said . " Yeah , " said Miller , " a new weapons-carrier . " " We just started bringing that stuff in over the Hump this spring , and they 're ruining it . "  | " Yeah , they ruin everything . " " Look , " said Michaelson , " did you ever see anything like this , how in hell do they expect to fight a war ? " Through their windshield they stared out at the winding , unending traffic jam that had bewildered their eyes for so long they now but rarely thought of it . The flight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liuchow . All the floating population of East China that had been pushed onto the roads and thrust back to the mountains for days and weeks and months was trekking along with them , slowing the buses and trucks in the procession to a creeping foot-pace . Younger men walked briskly along , some with foot-staffs , in determination ; others in unencumbered nonchalance . Family groups shuffled ahead , mother tugging children , father carrying baby pick-a-back on his shoulders . Other families pushed wheelbarrows , and the squeal of the unoiled barrow wheels screeched above all the other noises , of yelling , of braying , of chatter , of motors , of congestion . Others , peasants , carried all they had on bamboo staves , from both ends of which their bundles jiggled up and down in yo-yo fashion . Still others , thongs over their shoulders and bodies bent almost parallel to the ground , pulled two-wheel carts loaded with blankets , or suitcases , or wicker baskets . On one cart sat a little boy , his head wrapped in a shawl against the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveying the road from the mound of baggage on which he perched . Above the shoulder height of the procession , an old crone in a high , open sedan chair bobbed up and down on the shoulders of her two halfnaked carriers , whose flesh , despite the cold , glistened with the sweat of their burden . Her lips were chattering in silent dialogue with herself , and in her lap she clutched an enamel chamber pot . On another cart , the face of a grandfather clock poked its head above the clutter of goods it surmounted .  | " Man , I 've seen everything now , " said Miller as they watched and wormed their way along . " Hey , look , hey look , Mike , there 's a camel . " It was a camel , too , red-tasseled , gaunt , sway-necked , a child perched on top , a woman leading it . " Where in hell does that come from , Mike ? " asked Miller . " How do I know ? " said Michaelson . " Camels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the north in the retreat , maybe come out of a zoo , but every goddam thing in China is being pushed along this road like a sewer pump pushes garbage . One thing I know , that camel 's never gon na make Kweiyang ; he 'll make camel-meat before he gets there if you can eat camel-meat . " " Them cows , too , " said Miller . " Those are n't cows , dope , those are oxes , " said Michaelson as they passed a pair of plodding oxen , feet wrapped in old rags , laboring up the incline . Now , at the next incline , they began to run into wheeled traffic again , for the trucks and buses that pounded through the foot traffic on the downgrades and levels , slowed to a single , winding clot on the upslopes . " It 's these hills that bother me , " said Michaelson . " I do n't mind the levels or downgrades , because if worst comes to worst you can just step on the gas and barrel through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any time , these Chinese can jump you , and once we lose our wheels we do n't stand a chance . I wish Baldwin would move faster . " It was at this moment that Michaelson felt the convoy slowing again and lifting his foot from the gas , grunted , " Now what ? " They waited impatiently in the cab , smoking for a minute , two minutes , three minutes . An urchin tried to scramble up on ,  | their fender  --  a mother 's hand reached up , whacked him , hauled him down , began to beat , and the child to wail . Michaelson leaned out and yelled : " Ah , for Christ 's sake , let him alone . " The mother looked back at the American , her face slowly veiling to a cold expressionlessness , and spat . Michaelson laughed . They waited a few more minutes and Michaelson said : " You take the wheel , Miller . I 'm going forward and see what 's happening . Pick me up if we start moving . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American convoy , drawn up double-file beside another lane of Chinese trucks and carts . Square in their path , stood an old , rustflecked , sagging truck with Chinese army markings , loaded with cotton bales , and planted solidly , directly , in the middle of the road . " What 's happening , Collins ? " asked Michaelson as he picked out the slim , alert figure leaning against the hood of the jeep , surrounded by a knot of children . " This , sergeant , " said Collins , " is China , the land of ancient culture and the fast buck . " " Oh do n't give me that crap again , " said Michaelson , not in any anger at Collins but because it was the role they played with each other . Collins went on in the same tone : " Here we have half a million people walking out over two hundred miles of road and maybe a hundred thousand of them will die before they get to shelter . But the truck up there belongs to some clever gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton in Kweilin or Liuchow before he evacuated , and is now expediting them north to Kweiyang and Kunming where he will make a small fortune  | if the cotton gets there safely , which it will not . Anyway , " ? here Collins broke tone and style of his talk and went on , " the joker with the truck is set right in the middle of the road and he wo n't back off or let anyone else pass unless he gets a push , because his truck wo n't work . And the bus behind him has pushed him up this hill halfway and the bus people say they wo n't push any longer because their own engine is overheating and beginning to conk out . So we 're all stuck . " " Well , let 's shove him off the road , and get going , what are we waiting for ? " " Because it 's a Chinese army truck and the three guys with it are in uniform and have guns , and probably a cut of the profits if they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese colonel are up there arguing with them now , and the colonel has got the woman with him up there to translate . I do n't see how we can move them without a gunfight and that 's not a very bright idea . " At this moment , one of the children gabbled in Chinese at Collins and he reached in his pocket , took out a cellophanewrapped sourball , peeled it and popped it in the child 's mouth . ' Hie child 's face was radiant , and all the children clamored . " So what the hell are you doing here with these kids ? " Michaelson asked . Collins , leaning against the jeep , stared coolly back at Michaelson , deliberately reached in his pocket , pulled out a D-bar , broke it in bits , and began to pop chocolate crumbs at the children . Then he answered . " I 'm giving some candy to the kids . " " Jesus Christ , Collins , we 're in a jam ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michaelson.  | " I know we 're in a jam . And we 're going to have to do something about that truck , because nobody else here dares to . In a couple of minutes our major up there is going to realize it , because he 's a pretty smart guy , I think . And when we do , this crowd can go either way  --  for us or against us , and I 'd like to have the crowd with us if we have trouble . See ? See those people watching us ? " Michaelson looked away from the children , to where several older Chinese were regarding them and smiling . " They like kids . I like kids . Kids like candy . Same all over the world ; make friends with the kids , you make friends with their parents . That 's how you make votes . " At that moment , one of the children broke away from Collins , ran to his mother , whispered to her , and came back with his hand dangling some red paper cut-outs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they were cut of stiff red paper , paper moons , paper stars , paper designs . Collins smiled , thanked the child , turned to Michaelson . " See  --  he 's saying thank you for his candy . The Chinese cut this paper stuff up all the time to make toys for their kids . Cheaper than our toys . Some people think it 's an artform , but I suppose you would n't be interested in that . " Michaelson 's temper blasted off as if the pressure within had blown the safety-cock . " Oh my God , Collins , you 're a jerk . We got to get this convoy rolling . This ai n't the time to make friends , we got to do something with that major . Collins , if it were up to me , I 'd break your back . " Collins smiled , then was very grave , and spoke slowly . " Listen , Mike , we may or may not have trouble here in a minute . But if there 's going to be trouble we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too many friends , that 's the first rule of politics . Besides , I like the kids . "  | " Go ahead , make friends , " yelped Michaelson , " some day they 'll beat your goddam brains in , " and he turned , pushing his way through the crowd to where Baldwin , Kwan and the woman stood facing a swart , dark man in an officer 's uniform . From the uniform dangled a belt in which a pistol hung and the officer 's hand lay on the pistol . Kwan was bellowing , Baldwin 's face was frozen with anger , but the stubbornness of the uniformed Chinese in command of the truck needed no translation . He stood , legs spread apart , unmoved , interrupting the flow of Kwan 's invective with flat , negative ejaculations . His truck would be pushed up the hill , or no one would move . " What 's up , Major ? " asked Michaelson . " We 're going to have to move that truck off the road , Michaelson . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mood quickened  --  he realized he was happy that the major was glad to see him , but happier because the major suddenly sounded like McNeil . McNeil had taken no crap from the Chinese on the road . Baldwin beckoned to Madame Hung , who beckoned to Kwan ; a hasty consultation took place , and Kwan went back to the uniformed truck man again . Baldwin turned to Michaelson and speaking quickly , as several Chinese faces pressed in on them to catch their incomprehensible English words , said : " Now listen , Michaelson . This is a fast one . We have to shove that truck off the road . But it 's going to have to look like an accident . And we do n't want any shooting , remember that . Kwan is asking him now to let you look his engine over . You 're supposed to be my mechanic . You 're going to look that engine over  --  and look it over , too . Maybe you can pass a miracle , or find a wire that 's come unstuck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push it . Got that ? "  | " Yup . " " Prince is going to bring his truck up behind the cotton truck . Kwan 'll get the other Chinese trucks to inch back a bit . Then you 're going to get at the wheel of the cotton truck as if you were trying to get it started . When Prince starts to push you , you will simply guide that wheel slowly over the side of the hill and let the truck tumble . You 've got to get out of the cab just as soon as she starts to tip . But it 's an outside curve so I think you can do it . Can you ? " " Major , it 'll be a pleasure . " This was going to be good . Baldwin checked him . " And listen , we 're not doing this for fun . This is because we have to , see ? " t There was , as Michaelson could tell immediately , when he lifted the cotton truck 's hood , nothing he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did , when he saw a piece of machinery abused . Crusted rust , layers of dirt , grease rags , fouled the inside of the engine . The fanbelt had been hammered together with nails and was about to slip its raceway . There was no spark . A trickle of water from the radiator showed that it leaked . Michaelson tapped the distributor head , tried to work the horn , tried to work the starter , acted briefly as if he were working , then pulled his head out . " No miracle , Major , let 's go into the act . " Again a babble of voices , Baldwin to Madame Hung in English , Madame Hung to Kwan in Chinese , Kwan to the truck driver in formal-deceptive Chinese . Behind the cotton truck a backing and filling of the other Chinese trucks took place and a space was cleared . Collins deftly maneuvered the jeep , with Madame Hung now in it again , beyond the cotton truck and to the front of it . Prince maneuvered his six-by-six into position behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton truck  | and noticed the alternate Chinese driver still sitting there , on the outside , the side that would fall off down the slope . " Hey , what about him ? " he said , leaning out of the cab , yelling to Baldwin . " Get him out , " yelled Baldwin , " get him out . " " Let him stay , " yelled Michaelson above the engine sound of Prince 's truck which was now gently nudging him , " what the hell difference does it make ? " " No , " yelled Baldwin , " no , hold it . " Another conference took place . At the end of it , suspiciously , the uniformed man with the pistol came over to the far-side of the truck and asked his driver to get out . Michaelson let his arm drop out of the cab in signal that he was ready , and behind him Prince came nosing with the bumper of the six-by-six . With a lurch , the cotton truck jolted ahead , settled hack against Prince 's bumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Michaelson 's hand , he twisted it , the truck let itself be guided , he could feel a drive wheel , a front wheel , slipping over the edge . By reflex he pulled it back , his hand reached for the cab door , he tugged the wheel again , the off-end of the cab tilted , he could feel the far-end slipping , it was going . . . . With a quick motion , Michaelson had the cab door open , was on the running board and as the truck , awkward , like a sinking vessel slowly careening into the deep , began to fall away from his foot , he leaped for the road , made it , danced on tiptoe and , instinctively , let the carbine slip from the shoulder sling into the ready position at his elbow . Between him and the uniformed truck man there was now nothing but space , the people drawing back in a circle of audience , and across the space the twisted raging face of the uniformed Chinese truck man thrust forwards toward Mi-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the belt and the two of them , guns in hand , stood there , staring at each other as the truck bounced , and bounded , and crashed and rattled down the hillside . Above the noise of the truck , and in the silence , Michaelson heard Baldwin yelling : " Do n't make a move , Mike , do n't shoot , hold it . " But he knew that if the Chinese hand with the pistol lifted even an inch , he would fire first and get him . , The truck driver and Michaelson faced each other for seconds and then around them , like the clap of cymbals , came a peal of Chinese laughter ; the crowd was with the Americans , the crowd was laughing at the way the driver had been tricked , and it was over . The truck man had lost face , thus lost all  --  the right to fire , the right to ride , the right to the fortune that was now tumbling down irretrievably to burst and waste in the winter snow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind coughing into action . There was the sweet stink of an alcohol-burning motor , the sour smell of a diesel motor clearing cylinders to move again . Baldwin signaled with his arm , and Prince rolled by , followed by Niergaard in Lewis ' truck , followed by Ballo , followed by Miller . Miller halted . " What happened ? " he called . " Get in , " said Baldwin to Kwan who was still with them , and taking him by the elbow , thrust him aboard . " Get in , " snapped Baldwin to Michaelson . But Michaelson said , " You get in , I 'll ride the running board . " Baldwin scrambled in , the door slammed . Michaelson caught the handle and was on the running board as the truck started . He shrank against the truck door , wincing . The shot came as he knew it would , a pap from the pistol , a whiz through the air , and a clean miss .  | He could not swing the carbine with the one arm free , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these slopeys , before the war was over he 'd get one . Baldwin rolled down the window and leaned out . " We 'll put a couple of miles between us and that swine , and then I 'll shift back to the jeep , " he said . And then before rolling the window back up , " Nice work , Mike , nice work . " They reshuffled on the level , on the down-side of the slope , and Baldwin , taking the wheel of the lead jeep himself , with Collins beside him , the woman and Kwan behind him , jabbed the jeep off with a jack-rabbit start . An elation , a strange exhilaration had entered liini . Ile had not meant to destroy the truck when he first saw it ; he had simply known what he had to do and had clone it . Best of all was the swing with which everyone  --  Michaelson , Kwan , Prince , all of them ? had fallen into the act , had caught his command when he had made it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racketeers were walking out in the cold . Philip Baldwin , Scourge-of-the-Highway , Baldwin-Takes-Over , Baldwin-Clearsthe-Way , his daydreaming whispered , and he chuckled , for he felt good all over . Not even Ilclen could have faulted him on that one , and he remembered how every now and then , but more rarely in the later years , he could shake her out of criticism and wring the soft praise , " Oh , good , Phil , oh , good . " He would write to her about this ; he knew he had done a clean job . Vaguely , for a moment , he wondered whether he could have done it had they not been racketeers , not been so clearly wrong . Or whether he could have done it had they been Americans , in an American truck , not Chinese . And he knew he could have . A hand tapped his shoulder  --  it was Kwan.  | " Hao , " blurted Kwan , " hao ! " Baldwin knew it meant good . It was the first time Kwan had opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel momentarily to cast a glance back at Kwan  --  leaning forward , talking ? and then Baldwin flicked his eye back to the road . But the momentary glance had shown a new Kwan . You could talk with Chinese for hours ; and if they did not trust you , or were not there for you , it was as if they were in retreat , curtained and veiled from any understanding behind the meaningless stare of their eyes . Then , suddenly , they would change , something would wipe the expressionless gaze from their eyes , their eyes would sparkle , they would be with you , alive . All yesterday he had sensed Kwan aloof , remote , possibly hostile . But the slight , taut Chinese , leaning forward to say " Good , " had now lost his rigidity and glowed with warmth and approval . Baldwin found himself liking Kwan . And as he warmed in response , the woman spoke , too , in English . " Well done , " she said . " Oh , that was good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Baldwin and Collins translated . " There is never anything else to do , " said Kwan , " but sometimes people can not do it . " It was the woman who translated Kwan 's Chinese this time , and Baldwin realized they were becoming a group in the jeep , almost friends . The day had started well , and he did not want to lose the feeling . Today was the day to get something really good done . The road ought to be ripped to pieces some place before Hochih  --  VICINITY HOCHIH , the message had read  --  and any place would do . The refugees were an annoyance , he was making slow time , but he felt he was doing it for them , too . Cut the road and keep the Jap out . Simple . " Where do they all come from ? " he asked out of his think-  | ing , throwing the question to Collins to throw to the two Chinese in back . " From the cities now , " said Kwan , " from the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the rule . When the army goes , the people must go . If the army goes and the people stay , the Japanese will use them . This is the rule : Scorch the earth , fill the wells . ' " Collins hesitated for a moment in the translation , trying to interpret the Chinese phrase . The woman 's voice broke in pleasantly to correct Collins ' translation . When Kwan resumed , it was she who was translating : " If the Japanese find houses , they can sleep in them . If they find food , they can eat . If they find people , they can use them . They tie our people with ropes and make them pull the guns . They make them carry ammunition . If they find Chinese people , they do not need trucks . Whatever they need , they make our people do . They do not care if they kill our people . Because they can not make friends with our people , they make animals of them . The men , the women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . So we must make the people retreat . " Baldwin could not tell whether it was Kwan 's voice or the woman 's translation that suddenly fell from a rising tone of bitterness and wrath , to a note of sadness on the last sentence . " But what if they do n't want to go ? " asked Baldwin . " Then they must go , then the army must make them go . We must burn their houses , bum their bridges , make them take their food away or we must burn it to keep it from the Japanese . There is no way . The people must go when the army goes . " " It 's rough on the people . " " They eat bitterness . Especially these people . " " Is this any different from other retreats ? " asked Baldwin .  | " Yes , " said Kwan , " these people are different . In the beginning , everyone retreated , the peasants , the workers , the merchants , the students , from Shanghai , from Canton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer go . They stay . Only the city people we can make go now . And these people . They have come once already from the coast , at the beginning of the war they came here to Kwangsi and Hunan . They were very good people , who hated Japanese . They would not stay behind under the Japanese . Now they must go again . The second time . But it is better than at the beginning . " " Why is it better ? " asked Baldwin . " Because in the beginning , only the Japanese had airplanes . In the beginning they would kill everyone on the road . Everyone walked at night . Now only the Americans have airplanes , so it is better . They walk by day . " Baldwin considered the thought for a moment and then , the woman , speaking for herself , added : " I do n't know whether he 's right or not . It 's safer , I know , if this is safe . But in the beginning we only hated the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess we hate each other . " She had now thoroughly joined the group . He found her thought interesting and began to study the road again . Ahead , several miles away on a level , Baldwin could see a footpath cutting across the fields , marked by moving clumps of plodding people , the path curving into the main road as a tributary pours its stream into the parent river . " And those people , there , where are they coming from ? " he asked . " More people , " said Kwan . " There are many foot-roads in China . The people who walk from the East take the little roads across the mountains . But there is nothing to eat in the  | mountains , they can not buy food . So they come back to the main road . This is Kwangsi , there is still food . In Kweichou , there will not be food even on this road . " " Why ? " asked Baldwin , and Madame Hung answered without waiting for Kwan to reply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But these hills are the border of Kwangsi . Kweichou is a mountain province , the poorest in China ; it has n't even any history , and the other edge of Kweichou is Tibet , it is n't even Chinese . By the time we get to Kweichou , everybody walking out will have to come down to the main road to look for food . It 's the only real road in this part of China . " Her words brought him back to the problem again : the road . The exhilaration of the fray with the cotton truck was still with him . IIe had to , he would , today , soon , do something about this road . The meandering gray-yellow strip that stretched before him teased and tantalized him . The ground never came to rest , it pushed and swelled , rose and fell , the folds and gray ridge-lines stretching colorless ahead as far as he could sec . It is a bad road , thought Baldwin . It has no majesty . It should be blown . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just one good blow before we get to Hochih , just one and that will fix it . His jeep wheel caught in a frozen rut ; he jerked the steering wheel , got out of the rut , annoyed by the road . Tear it apart , then rebuild the whole thing after the war was over . " How long has this road been in ? " he asked Kwan . " The road is very old . And very new , " said Kwan . " It is very old because it was built in the days of the Emperors . For the couriers . For horsecarts . For mules . For hundreds of years , this road goes through this valley down to Kwangsi . Also for opium . In the beginning the opium went up this , road from Canton to Yunnan , to Ssuchwan . Then , the people  | in Yunnan began to grow poppy , and the road was used to send opium down to the cities . Then the war , and the Generalissimo built the road over again for trucks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think this is a good road ? " " Well , " said Baldwin , not wanting to put a strain on the sense of comradeship that had just developed in the past hour , " we build them differently back home . " " With machines , " said Kwan , " I know . China needs machines . Much machinery . Even more than guns . Machinery to build roads , factories . Like America . But this road , the peasants built . With their hands . " Baldwin peered . Winding and kinking and coiling about itself , the road was flung over the hills . Every now and then the road 's builders had had to lift it from one watershed to the next , switching from the bed of one little stream to the next , following the water back up to the parent plateau . Whenever this happened , the road 's engineers working with coolie labor , mattocks , hand-baskets for dirt-hauling , handpicks for chipping , had been forced to scratch inches off the mountain side , twisting the highway back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one above the other . Baldwin could imagine he saw fingernail marks on the sidewall of the mountains where men had scratched away with bare hands . How did they do it ? Where did they teach Chinese engineers to use people like this ? All the calculations of his education faded to shadow . No slide rule multiplying cubic yardage by tonnage , total fill by haulage distance , multiplying bulldozer days by truck capacity by cement requirements by union wages so as to get a cost estimate or an engineering judgment  --  none of these constants of his training fitted into China . I could n't build a thing their way , Baldwin told himself , I could n't build a thing my way in this country either . But I can destroy .  | This is n't a good road , it 's a bad road , and it 's dangerous , just dangerous enough to let the Japanese in . Now where shall we do it , he asked himself , clutching back at his problem , and , aloud : " Tell Kwan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hairpin bend , a real good horseshoe , something that 'll make a sidehill blow for today 's work and cut this thing permanently . " Collins struggled to explain and Madame Hung took over again . " Let me , " she said , and went into Chinese . " Yes , " said Kwan , " that is right . On the side of a mountain . Where the road goes back and forth on top of itself . Five , six , seven times before it crosses the top . We call it a noodle road . Like that ... " And he pointed . Baldwin looked off into the distance as Collins ' finger pointed where Kwan had first indicated . As his eyes focused , the road trace against the immense hills became clearer and clearer . And it was a beauty , he told himself . He counted . There were seven bends , one directly above the other as the road mounted the high range beyond them . With one or two craters at the bends , possibly a ditch on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Or maybe , with luck , find a snout at one of the bends where they could shave the nose of the mountain right off . His spirits soared . The job ahead was so clean it might have come out of the Field Manual . He could even remember the language , almost see the page in the book : " EXECUTION OF A DEMOLITION REQUIRES , I. THE OBJECTIVE SOUGHT ( MISSION ) II . TIME AVAILABLE  | III . EXTENT OF DEMOLITION NECESSARY TO FULFILL THE OBJECTIVE SOUGHT , ETC . . . . " There were twelve points , said the book , in planning a demolition , but already Baldwin 's mind surged ahead to the hairpin climb , with its clean complications , the formulas of charge , the substance of the equation with its variables of roadbed consistency , the resources in his trucks , the skill of his men , the mathematics that put these together . This was why he had become an engineer . And now he was bossing his own field operation , his own command , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up to him . He turned around in his seat to Kwan , almost happily , then squelched the eagerness in his voice as he realized he was happy and , to a Chinese , the destruction of a Chinese road might not seem quite so gay . " That 's it all right , " he said , " that 's where we take her out . " " It is a good place , " said Kwan . " Halfway up , " said Baldwin , " the third or fourth turn from the bottom , try to slide as much down on the lower turns as possible . " " Excellent , " said Kwan , " then , if they want to fix the road , then their trucks must come up three bends , and the road is too narrow for them to turn around . " " Right , " said Baldwin , proud that his reasoning was so clear and that Kwan understood and approved .  | CHAPTER J Sjdehill Blow QUITE CONFIDENT NOW , determined to keep the rhythm of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was no point in talking , Baldwin curtly halted the convoy at the bottom of the escarpment , and , freed of his cumbersome tail of trucks , gunned the jeep , with its company of three , up the hill . The grade here , he sensed from the jeep 's angle , was steeper than at any of the foothills they had climbed in the past two days and the knew this must be the first shelf of the plateau they were defending . There was good geography in the cable stipulating : VICINITY IIOCHIH . It was at the second horseshoe from the top that Baldwin found what he was looking for  --  an outside curve . To the right , the mountain fell off from the shoulder almost sheer , tumbling down through slopes of stunted scrub and naked rock to a little river far below . On the left , the mountain face had  | been chipped away with an arching half-tunnel effect that left a rock overhang over the roadbed ten feet thick . He could see still the drill marks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place their black powder and chip it to bits . His eye , following the drill marks , could see that the rock face of the mountain was only partly naked here , creviced in spots , a pudding of boulder and stone at the bottom of the arch  --  an entirely dirty , unstable formation which any American engineer would have cleaned out when the road was built . But the instability of it all delighted him now . With luck , with good calculation , if the rock formations were right , they would not only ditch the road here , and trigger a rock-fall ; they would shave a nose clean off the mountain face , cascading boulders and rock down the slopes to all the levels below , to block the Japanese on the twisting bends beneath until it could be cleared . He got back into the jeep , wheeled it briskly about , headed down the slope again to the trucks , his horn and brakes alternating as he threaded the one-way traffic against him . The rise at the horseshoe , he figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred fifty , a gradient of fourteen per cent , and his mind , automatically , told him that the Chinese engineer who had done this was mad , a genius , and had probably never gone to an engineering school in his life . If they slipped it , with any luck at all they should leave an elevation of some twenty feet for the Japanese to face when they brought their vehicles up the road . To slip it meant work , though , all the rest of the day , back-breaking work ; and everything would have to work , the auxiliary motor for the air hammer , the hand-augurs , the men most of all . Hours of work , under strain . But if five hours ' work of eight men could slip it , it would take the Japanese fifty men , with  | heavy equipment , three days or a week to repair it . There was a margin there . Of how much ? Of perhaps one hundred to one . Some day , he thought , I 'm going to rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for physical earth-moving , but for the supreme calculation of demolition . If one man 's work required the repair of effort of two men , did you have a profit ? Should the minimum margin be one man 's effort at destruction to ten men 's effort at repair ? And how did you figure instrumentation ? When you smashed the traversing or elevating mechanism of an artillery piece , how many man hours had gone into making it , how many into assembling it  --  how many into getting it there ? Getting it there was a factor in the equation . The gasoline they had blown in l , inchow was high-octane aviation fuel ? probably a dollar a gallon back home . But what was it worth when it had been tankcred to Karachi , road-hauled from Karachi to the Ilump , flown over the Hump , each gallon delivered having burned up another gallon of similarly valuable fuel to get it across , then flown across China from Kunming to Kwangsi and stored ? And the planes and lives lost getting it there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable because it was where it was . But how valuable ? Two bullets and five seconds burned a gasoline shed , the margin of destruction must be a million to one there . A road , this road now , must rank pretty low in a trade of destruction , compared to the gasoline . Except that there was a time factor , how did one weigh the time of eight Americans today against the time a Japanese column might be delayed the day after tomorrow ? He was approaching the trucks now , and he could see the men smoking , and the usual Chinese wayfarers lingering in a circle to watch them . The thing to do was not to explain to  | the men but to excite them . Everything was going well , except for Lewis being sick . Lead them back up the hill , show them the job , break it down , move them fast , keep going . Ride them up to the overhang , then stop , then get to work . Half an hour later , in the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road , tilting into the gutters out of the traffic , beyond the overhang , Baldwin gathered them together . They had acquired , already , a part-Chinese look . Prince had , from somewhere , annexed a Chinese soldier 's winterpadded , cotton-quilt vest . Miller was wearing an ankle-length khaki overcoat , over an air-force fleece jacket , and the overcoat draped his tubby body like a tent . Niergaard wore a Chinese soldier 's peanut-vendor hat . Several had fleece-lined pilot 's jackets , all wore paratroop boots . It was not the way an American outfit was supposed to look . Baldwin stared at them for a moment ; bleary-eyed , sallow , unshaven , all dirty . They looked back at him suspiciously and Baldwin edged into it carefully . " Mike , " he asked , " have you any idea of what we 're still carrying ? " " Well , " began Michaelson , whose truck carried the explosives , " we 've got maybe fifty sticks of the dynamite that 's making me nervous . It 's so cold today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezes we just ca n't carry it in the trucks . The way this road bounces , it could flash any time once it freezes . The dynamite ought to go right away if we use anything here . Then we 've got three full cases of the TNT in the halfpound blocks , three hundred pounds all told . Figure another twenty , thirty pounds in loose blocks . We got a couple of cases of the nitro-starch half-pound blocks , that 's another two hundred pounds . We got one cratering charge left , lots of time  | fuse , maybe a hundred of those small reels of primacord , anyway plenty . Plenty of caps , all kinds of caps . I guess that 's it . We 're loaded with gasoline , plenty of rations . That 's it . " " Fine , " said Baldwin . His mind had been working on the calculations all the way down the slope and back up again to the overhang . There was no deal involved in this , no negotiation for permission , nothing but the clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had only to fit the charges to formula ; and fit the men to the work . " Listen , now , all of you , " said Baldwin clearing his throat . " I want to try for the jackpot on this one . " He thought that sounded right , and could tell it did by the slow shuffle forward of Niergaard in interest . " We could spend all day hand-boring some chambers in the road on the flat , and have perhaps three or four ditches on the road of about ten or twelve feet deep at the end of a day that the Japanese could fill with refugee labor in another day . " He could sec Michaelson looking at him intently , and he remembered Michaelson was a foreman who had to understand the plan ; you could get Michaelson if he was interested in the job . Now he was speaking to Michaelson : " Or we can really try to take this road out , which is what I propose to do . This is a tough job , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be for the Japanese to fix . " He was telling them , he felt fine , he placed his hands on his hips , his voice fully confident . " This is the first big step up to the plateau . Up to now , we 've been coming out of Kwangsi through the low hills . From here on , the mountains climb and keep climbing into Kweiyang and Kunming . This is the first big elevation . And this overhang strikes me as thoroughly unstable . If we can slide it down , and slide the roadbed out at the same time , here on the curve , the Japanese wo n't be able to use this road  | again until they move heavy equipment up to work on it . " Now here 's the layout , " he continued . " It goes in two parts . The first part is the road itself . I want to shave this whole curve off , the whole lip of the curve as it winds around here . We 'll dig two strings of bore-holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be about ten feet apart , and they 'll run with the curve of the road right around the bend . Seven bore-holes to each string , on the standard pattern , alternating five-foot and seven-foot depths . That 's work with the big hand-augurs , and we 'll chamber out the bore-holes with the half-pound blocks until they 're big enough to take a major charge . " He had turned and was pointing out the pattern on the road when he heard one of them groan . He realized at the groan , the work and labor he was demanding . But he did not know who it was , and did not want to find out now . His mind was working on the calculations as he spoke . He had five hundred pounds of TNT and nitro-starch and fourteen holes . Twenty-five pounds to a chamber would be enough , more than enough , but there was no point in saving explosives . And then there would still be some left over for the overhang . " Now the second part is the overhang . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the limestone , the brute face of it . It would be dirty work . " We 'll have to use the air hammer , hooked up to the auxiliary ninety-six pounder to get in there . Either just under or just above the arch . Five holes , sixty inches deep for the dynamite . " " Do you see ? " he went on , hoping to excite them . " We 'll hook them all up on one circuit , and we blow simultaneously . The road does a double ditch , the overhang hammers down at the same time , and the whole lip falls all the way down .  | With enough concussion , we may loosen up a major fissure in this rock and take the whole nose of the mountain off . " They were alert , listening to him now ; they were pros , Baldwin knew ; they had volunteered for this outfit , and destruction excited them . Deep within himself , Baldwin could feel faintly stirring the same excitement , the almost sexual stirring that came before the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiled it , knowing too late he was saying too much . " That 's the rest of the day 's work , right here , and it 's hard work , I know . But if we can stop the Japanese here , even for a few days , it gives the people back on the plateau time to form some sort of line to stop them . If we rip this road out , here , now . . . why , why , " . . . he paused ? " we may be the ones who hold the whole thing together . " His preoration had fallen flat , he could see on their faces . They did not care about holding the whole thing together . He had sounded like a Sunday-school teacher . " All right , let 's get into it , " he snapped , harshly . " Oh my aching back , " he heard Ballo say as he turned away from them , and then Prince , mimicking him , softly , almost out of hearing , " We 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody 's gon na be happy . Two to one we 're here until night-time . And then it 'll be screwed up like Liuchow . Wan na bet ? " and Michaelson growling at both of them , " Shut up , for Christ 's sake , let 's get this thing over with , " and Prince snapping back , " Ah , blow it out your barracks bag , " and he realized their nerves were all on edge too , and they were snarling at one another because they could not snarl at him . But he must hold them to it . That was why they were here . It was a simple , uncomplicated  | job and he could see it clearly . But he ought to check Lewis while they were setting up for the job . In the back of the truck , Lewis was obviously worse , and a train of annoyance began to build in Baldwin . The job had to be done , but he was the only one who wanted to do it , and all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could scarcely blame Lewis , it was Lewis who kindled his anger first . No , said Lewis , he did n't want anything to eat . No he did n't want any coffee or water . Only a glass of milk . The permanent whine in Lewis ' voice had become a whimper and Baldwin could see how deep Lewis ' brown eyes had sunk into his scrawny face and how the hair was thinning , and how useless this man was . Lewis could not take pressure . The request for milk bothered Baldwin more than Lewis ' appearance . This was China ; there was no milk ; there was only milk in America , far , far away . And Lewis ' petulant insistence on milk , warm milk , meant that Lewis had no grasp on what was happening to him now , and was beginning to wander , like a child in fever . Baldwin 's determination to carry through today , with today 's work , could not erase the fact that by tomorrow , if Lewis were not better , Lewis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back in . Which was all the more reason for making today good , as good as it had promised to be when he pushed the cotton truck off the road , as good as it still might be if they could only blast the nose off the mountain . Covering Lewis with another blanket , promising him to open a can of condensed milk when they broke to eat , he walked back down the line of trucks , and saw that four of the men were already working on the road with the hand-  | augurs , two to an augur , straining away at its long twisthandles . But Prince and Ballo were sitting on a chest of TNT , the air hammer on the ground beside them , doing nothing . He stared at them coldly for a minute and said , " Well ? " " We were waiting for you to come back , " said Prince , deadpan . " Michaelson put us on the first trick with the air hammer , but he could n't figure how to get in there either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not order Prince , or Ballo either , to stand to attention . He could not order them to do anything until he told them how to do it , and he repressed the anger in him . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " Well , " said Prince , pointing to the underside of the arching rock , " I do n't see how we get in there , even if we brought a truck up to stand on the cab . And if we loosen anything , it 's liable to fall right down on us . " He said it patly , not pressing his point , acting stupid ; and Baldwin knew that Prince was not stupid . It was up to him then . He could not leave two men sitting around while the others worked ; nor could he give up the hope of the overhang falling , as it could fall and must fall if it were done right . The way to do it was to get on top and look for a fissure or crevice if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to drill the holes anyway . " Let 's try it from on top , " he said . " Get your truck around the bend , over to the side , so I can climb up . " Prince got in the truck , and deftly maneuvered it around the bend , as the road rose around the curve , close to the wall . Baldwin and Ballo followed on foot and Baldwin realized that Ballo was not gold-bricking , he was simply tired . Unsteadily , Baldwin clambered up to the top of the cab . Leaning from the cab to the shoulder of the overhang , he could swing onto the rock shoulder and then was on top of it .  | And he saw he was right . It was unstable . Rain , or frost , or natural erosion had cut several fissures in the slope that was the roof of the overhang . Studying them , Baldwin decided that at least one of them was wide enough for a man to get into . But it would be dirty . The man would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , cradling the heavy air hammer with one elbow and hand , direct it horizontally into the crack where it narrowed . Could anyone , he wondered , hold the twenty-pound hammer long enough on the horizontal , from that position , to dig into the necessary sixty inches ? Was the rock hard or soft ? he wondered . Would each hole take half an hour or an hour ? He wanted five holes and time moved on . He clambered out of the crevice , knowing he could not escape it , and yelled down to the two beside the truck . " Get the hammer up here to me . And hook it up to the auxiliary . I want to try it . " In a few moments , he could hear the auxiliary chugging , and Ballo had clambered up with the hammer , and since there was room for only one man in the crevice , Ballo had climbed down again , and Baldwin , supporting the hammer with his left hand and guiding it with the right , had the starbit against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could tell , and in good position he knew he could take out the sixty inches in less than half an hour . But the hammer was heavy , and as it bit and beat and shuddered and jolted his body through the arm , through the elbow , through the wrist , through the gripping fingers , he wondered if he could last it , and he knew he must . Every now and then , he turned , flexing and releasing the cramp in his numb left hand , triggering the air hammer to blow it clean , panting as his body began to ache , hating it , hating Prince , Ballo , Lewis , the road , China and the trap into which he had taken himself . If Hutcheson  | could see him here ; or Helen , he thought . Helen would know he was a fool . He pulled out the hammer after a while and with a huge effort , sat up erect on the edge of the crevice to let his back muscles ease from their torment for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent and unbent his stiff fingers , mechanically ; but the hammer had drilled forty inches he saw , measuring with his eye , and through the trembling of his body he realized it could then be done , after all . A rock rattled and he looked around to see Ballo climbing up to him . Baldwin tried to control the panting so that Ballo would not see it , but he panted none the less , as Ballo said : " Are you into it , Major ? Will it work ? " " Yes , " said Baldwin , still panting , still angry . " It 's my trick now . Want me to take over ? " " This bit 's getting dull , " said Baldwin . " Have we got any more in the kit ? " " Yes , sir , " said Ballo , and Baldwin realized the man was saying " sir . " " 1 ' 11 get them right away , sir , " he heard Ballo say as he scrambled clown to the truck , and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Baldwin was back in the crevice , forcing the bit deeper , hoping to take out a few more inches before handing over to Ballo , when lie was aware that Ballo was back . Turning , he could see that Prince had come up with Ballo and they were both ready . lle crawled out , stood up stiffly and said , " Twenty minutes is all anyone can take on this . The hammer is heavy . I want five holes , five feet apart . Sixty inches deep . Ballo on the first trick , Prince , you next . And I 'll have Michaelson rotate the rest up here for their trick , too . " He climbed down from the truck before they could reply , and still holding his breath from panting , but conscious he looked as filthy as any of them now , he explained the rotation  | and the job to Michaelson , and walked away . He wanted to be quiet for a moment , while the irritation and the cramp passed . Without thinking , he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . It would be good to hear her quiet voice . She was not in the jeep and , for a moment , concerned , he looked for her and then saw her , sitting on the edge of the road , looking out over the hills . " Hello , " she said , looking at his dirt-smeared woolens . " Is everything all right ? " " Fine , " he said . " Except for Lewis . How are you ? " " It was cold sitting in the jeep . And I felt so useless . I thought I 'd walk around a bit . " He sat down beside her , found a comfortable niche for his feet , and looked out on the gray-and-lavender heights descending before them over the road they had come . " It must be different for you , " she said softly . " I 'd forgotten how all this must look to an American . " " Why ? " he said . " People change so gradually that they never see themselves change , " she answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror of how you 've changed and everything has a new shape . " " Do you see a mirror here ? " he asked . She pointed down the road , with the people winding on it . " I 'd become so used to it , " she said . " I 've been with my husband 's headquarters for four years . I 've become used to seeing people on the road like this . But then , watching you , I could suddenly see it the way it looks to an American . " " How ? " he asked , puzzled . " In America , when the roads are crowded , it 's always for fun . Everyone is coming or going to a good time . That 's what  | roads are for in America . And I 've grown so used to this in the last few years ? " she waved her hand out into the distance ? " here , whenever the roads are crowded , there 's been a disaster . There 's been a flood , or a famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . We use them only for flight . I never thought about it before until just now . " " This is n't really much of a road , " he said . " Just good enough to be dangerous . " " I know , " she said . " In America it used to seem that the roads went where you made them go , like driving from New York to Boston , they go right over the hills , right across the rivers . Here  --  does n't the road sem to crawl ? It seems to go only where the mountains let it through . " " You 've been in Boston , then ? " he was bemused by the thought . " Yes , " she said . " You 're from Boston , are n't you ? " " I did n't know it showed , " he said , smiling . He was always hoping he did not sound like Boston , though he knew it was home , but now , being so far away , he was glad it showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen of the brown-and-russet city , with its parks , and its river , and the golden dome ? " When were you there ? " he asked . " I was there for four years . At school , " she said . " At Radcliffe . " He wanted to know more . " Oh , " he said . " Mow did you happen to go there ? " She was silent , somehow withdrawing from him as he pressed too far . " It 's a very long story , " she replied . " I know you have to work . You 're really going to cut this road today , are n't you ? " She had turned off anv questioning , gently but firmly , and  | he was back in contemplation of the road again , the irritation stirring underneath . " I hope , " he said . " We have a few more hours of work . " " It 's dangerous , is n't it ? " " Not very , " he said , " if you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . . . the people on the road . How do you get them out of the way ? " He had not thought of the people . The team had been working like divers up to now , as if under water ; the flow of people , carts , animals , vehicles coursing continuously about them . And however much Kwan had cursed and yelled to keep them moving , not to cluster , at least once every fifteen minutes the knots would build up until they had to be dispersed with shouts and threats . And now the people were going to complicate the job . He had not thought of the people in calculating the poundages , the chambers , the depths . He had thought briefly , earlier , of the danger of debris , without mats to cover the tamping . But he had decided to get his men far enough around the bend on the upper level before blowing , and to rely on distance alone to protect them against the fling of the explosion . But he was hoping for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , where the refugee procession moved . How could he halt the procession long enough to blow ? He was conscious of a new source of irritation . " Why , " he said , embarrassed to admit he had not yet thought of this , " why . . . is n't that why Kwan is along ... to handle the Chinese . . . . He 'll think of something . " " Not you ? " she asked . " We 'll think of something , " he said , trying to sweep the problem away until later .  | " Like what ? " she pressed . It was now suddenly enormously complicated , and he resented her pressing . Hastily , he tried to improvise for her . " Maybe we can talk some of these stragglers into cordoning off the road just below the cut , holding them down there . There 's no more truck traffic , we 've cleared the last trucks that passed the bridge we blew yesterday . It 's only foot traffic now . I guess most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow it . " If it worked the way he hoped it would , he knew that most of them would not . Not the animals . Not the carts . Not the old people . Or the sick . But some would . It was beginning to come to Baldwin that there was a difference between the cotton truck this morning and this job . The cotton truck had been a racket . But the refugees below were innocent . How would he stop the procession long enough to blow without blowing the road from under the feet of people who could not understand ? How ? " Maybe we can stop them just below the cut , " he went on , reaching for an answer , " by giving some of the stragglers some cigarettes , or some of the sugar , and they can make a cordon just below the blow . If there were enough food , I 'd open a couple of cartons at the cordon and that might hold them long enough to let us make the blow , or . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been last night when he had spoken of the peasant and his mule in the same way . " You mean leave some food as decoy . . . as if they were animals you want to bait . . . . And what about everyone down below when it tumbles down on them ? " Suddenly , he felt his irritation vent . The temper had been there for years and years simmering away at people who could not see when he saw clearly , who would not listen  | when he explained . He should not have to explain , now . She knew , somehow he expected her to know , that the road must be blown , someone must know he was right . " Do you think I like it ? " he flared . " What do you think I 'm trying to do ? This is n't my job . I 'd rather build a road than tear it down . Right now there 's only eighty miles between us and the Japanese back at Liuchow , and if they get as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kunming and Chungking . They 've always wanted to separate us , and if they separate Chungking from us you can wrap up this government and this country and this war and the whole damned thing is finished until the Navy lands in Shanghai . Nobody knows what the Japanese are going to do . But I 'm not leaving this road as an open invitation for them to come along . It 's up to me , and , damn it , I 'm trying to save what 's left . We 'll make some kind of barrier . As good as we can . How would you do it ? Just blow the road right out from under their feet ? Like a Chinese general would ? " He had jabbed her with the last question , as he had meant , too , because he was angry inside . She winced as if he had slapped her . He got to his feet , brushed his pants , trembling with anger , but aware that he had never spoken that way to a woman before , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furious with himself , the road , the men , with her , with the problem she had now focused so sharply that he could not ignore it , he got to his feet and walked back to where the men were working on the two-string ditch . As he approached them , he saw Prince flipping one of the yellow-paper halfpound blocks of TNT to Niergaard who stood by the shoulder of the road , packing a bore-hole for chambering . Niergaard fielded it deftly , placed it on the ground , raised his hand for another , and Baldwin lost his temper a second time . He knew  | the blocks were inert , that the TNT was stable and safe , but this was sheer carelessness . " Just keep on horsing around , you fools , " he yelled . " Just keep on horsing around and you 'll never even see Kweiyang , let alone home . " They looked at him blankly for he had never yelled at them before . He must get a grip on himself , he realized , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was digging on the road . He paced around the bend , checked their work , found himself elbowing one of the men off the twist-handles of the augur to work it himself and realized that it was easier to work the augur , sweating and straining , losing himself in it , than to figure out what to do about the people coming up the road . At two , Baldwin called a lunch break . By half past three , with five hours of work gone by , Michaelson had begun to stack the explosives by the side of the road and Baldwin had come to check them and run over once more his final calculations . The dynamite and TNT for the overhang were stacked neatly in one pile . More TNT and nitro-starch blocks were stacked separately for the chambers in the ditching holes . The detonating wire was ready in its reel , and the leads , he noted , were clean . The primers were ready . The caps in their compartments , eight to a box , were there . He calculated once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks of dynamite to wire up for the overhang . That made nineteen which fitted easily into the capacity of the thirty-cap blasting machine . Ile had far more explosive here than he needed ; but everything was going to work this time , he knew , exactly as he had calculated . Except for the people ; he had left them out of his calculation . And now he must do something about them .  | Telling Michaelson to spoon out the chambers and wire them up as soon as he could , ordering him to load all but fifty pounds of the excess TNT into the crevice of the overhang , Baldwin dismissed the technical job to Michaelson 's care and called for Collins to interpret . He was going to talk to Kwan . He had decided to turn the problem of the refugees below over to Kwan . Kwan was Chinese . " There is no way , from the beginning , there is no way , " said Kwan when Baldwin had explained the problem . Kwan must have seen it from the moment in mid-morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Ask him if he can stop them for just ten minutes , " said Baldwin . " How ? " said Kwan , and it was back in Baldwin 's lap . " If we set up a couple of empty gasoline drums across the road and string a rope across it , will that work ? " asked Baldwin . " They will go under the rope , " said Kwan . " Ca n't you explain to some of them , some of the soldiers , the stragglers , that they should form a cordon and hold the refugees ? " " How ? " said Kwan . " If I explain to the soldiers that we are cutting the road  --  then they will want to hurry ahead and get through . " " If we give them something ? " said Baldwin . " What ? " said Kwan . " They can not spend money here . Maybe a great deal of money , but we have no money . What else can we give them ? There is no way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cigarettes ? We have lots of cigarettes . What would they want ? " Kwan was withdrawing from him now , as the woman had  | up on the hill . Baldwin knew why this time . In Kwan 's eyes he was trying to bribe or buy Chinese like animals , with toys , or bait , or gifts . " What would you do ? " Baldwin asked Kwan unhappily . Kwan shrugged his shoulders and repeated , " There is no way . " Yet it was important . It was important that there be a warning on the road below , a warning that the refugees might ignore , a warning however meaningless and perfunctory , a warning for his conscience 's sake . It was almost dusk ; Michaelson had reported ready ; and a full quarter of an hour had passed since the charges had been laid before Baldwin had completed his decoy at the bend below the blow . It was a squalid thing when they had finished , put together of the leavings of the convoy . Two empty gasoline drums had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had poured the remaining gasoline of one of the drums into a hollow in the road and lit a fire , hoping curiosity and the warmth would hold a few wayfarers there . Two Chinese ? a soldier and a student  --  had been mobilized by Kwan with cigarettes , a pack of hard candy , a pair of spare paratroop boots , and wordy exhortations to warn all corners to wait for ten minutes until the dangerous road above was fixed . The refugee stream was thinner , for the dark was now fading the sky , and those Chinese who had watched them with curiosity making their ramshackle barrier had lingered to warm their fingers about the gasoline burning in the puddle . When they had halted the flow , Baldwin , Kwan , and Collins hastily climbed back aboard the jeep , raced it back up to the overhang , gingerly picked their way through the bore-holes , followed the wire up , and found the others waiting for them at the detonator.  | Baldwin worked fast now . He checked the leads of the detonating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial , flicked back , flicked up again  --  it was clean . The splices seemed good . He examined the bare leads , twisted the wires around the poles of the blasting machine and screwed them down tight . They were around the upper bend from the cut and they were far enough away . " Nobody down below ? " he asked of Michaelson . " All present , " said Michaelson . " Give it the call , " said Baldwin , and watched Michaelson cupping his hands . Then the yell , " Fire in the hole ! " It was senseless , he knew . All the Americans who understood the call were here gathered about him , and any Chinese who might overhear it would never know or understand . Yet the call of warning comforted him . " Fire in the hole ! " yelled Michaelson again , and the echo of the first call came rolling back to join the sound of the second . Baldwin saw that all the men had , by habit , pressed themselves against the mountain wall for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small as they could get . But he was sure they were far enough away . The little wait passed and Michaelson called for the third and last time : " Fire in the hole ! " and stepped back and said , " That 's it , Major . " In a caprice , Baldwin turned to Kwan and , gesturing to the machine with its long handle sticking up , invited him to plunge it off . Kwan shook his head , firmly . He did not want it . Baldwin stared at the Chinese for a moment and Kwan dropped his eyes , retreating into a blank veiling of expression . Grimly , Baldwin seized the hickory handles of the plungers and with a hard , smooth downthrust pressed , and paused , and heard the earth racket around hip . The sound boomed  | dully , rumbling , echoing , cracking ; and in a moment the earthwave brought a quivering and pounding under his feet . He straightened slowly after the sound and waited , as if he expected to hear something more . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on the hickory handles and relaxed them , then ordered the wires detached . Then , slowly , he walked back around the bend to see what he had done . A cloud of dust still hung over the cut , but by its size and as it began to settle , Baldwin could see that the blow had come off perfectly . He walked straighter now , erect . No one had been with him on this and the road had been cut none the less ? beautifully . The simultaneous charges in the road had all of them together clawed off the entire curve as the road bent one hundred fifty feet about the mountain , while the rock overhang had been hammered down from above at the moment when the two ditches had been erupting from below . From the outer edge of the torn road where he stood he could just barely see the outer edge of the road where it resumcd the curve , and the elevation from where he stood down to where the road resumed was twenty or twenty-five feet and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between where the overhang had been ripped off . Down below he could hear boulders and rocks still bumping and bouncing as they rumbled into the twilight depths . It would take a very agile young roan to clutch the face of the mountain and scramble across the gap to where the road began again . It would take work , hard work , and seasoned engineering to put a vehicle trace across the gouge . It was a good job . The others had followed after Baldwin to see , too . It had been their handiwork and he wanted them to see . They stared out , down the valleys and gorges , over the hideous , dusk-shrouded contours of the bleak and desolate range .  | " Fine job , " said Baldwin to Michaelson . " Good work . This will hold them " ? but quite loudly so that everyone could hear . " Wish I had a picture , " said Miller . " We have n't got a single picture of the whole summer 's work , and when I talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn right they ai n't gon na believe you , " said Ballo . " I do n't believe it myself . " " Sure makes a lot of work for the Slopeys , or the Japs , whichever tries to put it together again , " said Niergaard . " Hey , look at him , look at him , " said Prince suddenly . They looked . At the opposite lip of the gulch they had cut in the road a Chinese had appeared , lonesome and frail , an old man in a black , silk merchant 's robe , staff in hand and leaning . The old Chinese stared across the gap at the Americans , the Americans stared back . " I 'll betcha the old bastard 's real mad , " said Prince , and the rest laughed as if it were a joke . It was the laughter that set off the old man . His face twisted with rage , and his thin voice dribbled across the gap full of hate and cursing . He was too old to be afraid . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a rock , and swinging his arm wildly , flung it at the Americans . The rock traced a pathetically feeble arc through the air , then rattled down into the gap not halfway across . The old man screeched at them again , and the Americans were silent . " All right , " said Baldwin , " that 's enough . Let 's get back to the trucks , and get out . " Abruptly , he turned away and started to walk back , leading them . A gust of an updraft followed him as he walked and , on the wind , faintly from below , he could hear the sound of ? was it screaming or crying ? Or just the whistle of the  | wind ? He knew , still , that he had had to do it and that it had been even harder than the blow at Liuchow or pushing the truck off the road . But it had been the logical thing to do . Now it was cut . He had seen Loomis come back from mission , and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a sweep over Hong Kong , or Hanoi , where the bombs had dropped on the wharves , or close to the wharves , or in the houses near the wharves . They did not talk about who or what might be dying because they had dropped their bombs below , never . But that was because when a bomb fell from the plane you could not hear people crying . He could hear . It was no imagination . There was something crying again , there , far below , it was a voice wailing on the updraft of the wind from the level below . But it had been absolutely necessary . It was almost eight before they were all installed in the inn at Ilochih . Baldwin had forced the convoy ahead through the night after the blow , sensing the mountains still rising beneath his wheels , heading for the town that announced the border of Kweichou . The town , as it opened up , pale and ghostly , in the light of their headlights , was carpeted with people , as if the endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , exhausted from the climb . At Hochih , Baldwin had turned matters over to Kwan , as he had the night before at the little village ; and Kwan had sensed that there was something there in the shifting dark , as a swimmer does who reaches with his toe and finds a hummock of unstable sand off the shore on which to balance . The town was in dissolution as all the road was in dissolution , but Kwan had found troops and their division headquarters , an  | uneasy island in the rout . And the headquarters had a general whose soldiers still sluggishly took his command . Baldwin had left negotiations to Kwan , and when Kwan emerged from the headquarters to report , Baldwin had confirmed the deal although he felt vaguely it must be a dirty deal . The general was a Ssuchuanese , said Kwan , who had offered to clear out half the inn in town in return for some gasoline for his own car , and Baldwin had paid with three jerrycans full . It was Lewis ' condition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and needing shelter , and all of the men tired after the job they had done today ; it was up to him to find them bed space . After the jerry-cans had been paid , the convoy had pushed its way through the frigid , dark streets , where people froze and moaned , and had come to a courtyard . After much shouting and violent noises inside , the Ssuchuanese general 's platoon had cleared the cobbled courtyard for the trucks to enter , and emptied two rooms off the courtyard for the Americans to sleep in , and they had settled down . Baldwin was now , in recapping the day , sorry for Lewis and aware that Lewis was some part , a growing part of his obligation , and stuffing down his distaste and annoyance with the man who should not , must not , be weak at a moment like this when there were things to do , Baldwin went to tend him . Thin and gaunt , Lewis lay stretched in a bedroll by the charcoal fire , his brow hot to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , the dark eyes opening in recognition , and he murmured , " I 'm sorry , Major  --  I guess I 'm sick . " Baldwin tried to cheer him up . He forced some broth , made from the powdered beef bouillon , down Lewis ' throat , and followed that with three of the multipurpose bull pills they carried in their medicine kit , and  | spread another blanket over the sick man 's bedroll . But there was no connection between Baldwin and Lewis , and Baldwin withdrew when Miller had come to sit down beside them . Miller , with his big , bulging body should have been a nurse , thought Baldwin , as he heard Miller 's voice meaninglessly droning on to Lewis as he walked away .. . " . . . so there I am , laying there , sick as a dog , and my Aunt Mary she comes in and she says , I do n't hold with these new doctors , what he 's got is catarrh of the chest . You know she 's old-fashioned , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gets you well . You know something . . . I go along with her . These new health foods ... " Baldwin looked around the room . He did not want to be with any of them ; he did not want to be alone ; and the smell of the pork-and-gravy that was cooking again nauseated him . He reeked of pork-and-gravy , and the thought came that even Spam would taste good when they got back to Kunming . The men were dog-tired , he could see by the droop in their bodies as they squatted , and as he continued to study the halflit room lie realized that there were only three people alert . In the corner , Collins and the woman were sitting on a bedroll and Kwan , taut and slim , was talking to them . Kwan 's face had come out of the withdrawal again and was alive . Kwan was speaking slowly but with animation , very slowly , so that Collins , whose attention spoke in every line of his young face , could follow . The woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Chinese officer , now slowly returning with fondness to the young American . Baldwin watched them for a moment and his ear began to pick up the rhythm of the incomprehensible flow of Chinese as the Chinese officer spoke . It was a familiar rhythm , and then Baldwin placed it . Over and over again , in conferences with the Chinese at Kunming , Baldwin had noticed that the  | better Chinese officers all spoke as if they were talking to a classroom , with the didactic , sequenced logic of a teacher . More often than not the logic was madly unreasonable . But , in translation , it always seemed so spuriously good as they counted off their reasons  --  First , Second , Third , Fourth , and so on . That was it . Kwan was teaching ; and Collins was a student , with the open , excited enthusiasm of a student on his glowing face , learning new things , wanting to learn . It was a wonderful face , Baldwin thought , and for a moment a wave of affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only possible person in the convoy who might know what it was about ; Collins liked the Chinese , too , and could understand why it was important that they help hold the plateau . The others were cogs . Something tugged at him from inside , and he quietly walked over to join the warmth of the group . " Say , " said Collins when Kwan 's discourse broke for a minute , " he 's telling me about these troops that cleared the inn here for us . " " What about them ? " Baldwin asked . " It 's one of these Ssuchuan divisions . They 've been on the road to the front down from Ssuchuan , since July . . . walking . It 's a real , old-fashioned division , belonged to some joker whom the Generalissimo knocked off several years ago . Kwan 's been explaining this campaign . It 's fascinating . He has a theory that the war is a matter of four things : first , transportation ; second , bastions ; third , equipment ; what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " First , second , third , fourth , " said Baldwin dryly . Collins looked at him uncomprehendingly and Baldwin said , " Go on , I want to hear how he works it out . " Collins resumed : " Geographically , he says , the Generalissimo has to hold the  | four bastions  --  the north pass at Sian , the Yangtze river front , the , Salween front , and the big plateau here . Then , secondly , he has to be able to move stuff by foot to each of those fronts faster than the Japanese can go by rail or truck . And then the equipment has to come from America . But the most difficult , he says , is loyalty . He has to keep the discipline in order to hold their loyalty . He has to hold down the Communists in the north , the local people in Ssuchuan , and a few other warlords , too . Every time he can move a Ssuchuan division out of Ssuchuan , that also releases a Central division which does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division does n't fight the Japanese , it 's released some Central troops somewhere to fight the Japanese , too . " Kwan had been listening as Collins spoke to Baldwin , following the two Americans ' conversation by the woman 's murmured translation . But the courtliness of his attitude had bccn wiped out . What could be said to a student , could not be said to an equal . And Baldwin was an equal . Baldwin wanted to hear more , too . It was easing the tiredness in him to listen to this . He squatted on his heels and said : " I hope I 'm not interrupting . I 'd like to hear this . " But he had interrupted . For when Kwan resumed , it was in a different vein , in more complicated Chinese , and the woman , breaking in , took up the translation . " What the Americans should understand , " she translated from Kwan , " is that Chinese believe that every man has an exact relationship to every other person . The son to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his student . The soldier to his officer . The prince to his people . This is the harmony of the good society . When each person knows his duties above and below . " Kwan folded his hands behind his back and his little figure  | was very tense and school-masterly again as he concluded : " The trouble now is  --  no man has discipline any more . The relations have broken down . If no man knows his duties , there is no discipline . If there is no discipline , there is no loyalty . If there is no loyalty , there is no government . There will not be government until China is one again and each man knows his duty and relationship . " Baldwin pondered it . Like so much he had heard from the Chinese it all sounded so plausible , yet he knew it did not make sense . But the woman , unable to stay out of the conversation , was adding something of her own , to Collins , as if explaining a difficult passage to a child . Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours before on the road . Now the warmth of her voice made him wonder why he had been so angry . " He 's talking from Confucius , of course . It 's what we call the Old Learning . But he 's right , " the woman said . " What 's right ? " asked Baldwin , breaking in . She turned to him and he could see that she had dismissed her anger with him , too , and he was pleased as she answered , conversationally , " The five relationships Kwan was talking about . What Confucius says is that there is something like a contract between all men . The prince has a contract with the people : they must serve him and he must protect and take care of them . The father must care for the family , and they must obey him . Each man must serve the one above him , and the one above must protect . If it dissolves , then you have anarchy . If the prince can not protect the people , he is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I thought he was one of the gods here , " said Baldwin . " No , " she said gravely . " No , he is n't a god . He was a teacher , he taught government long before Europe had any  | government . There are temples to him , of course , and a lot of people worship him . But he 's what we call a kuei . ' I do n't know how to translate that . Sometimes it means a ghost , or a demon . But really it means a spirit , an idea . He 's an idea , not a god . " " And there is n't any God , then ? " Baldwin asked . " Oh yes , " she said . " Of course . I 'm a Christian , but China has gods , real gods . I think Kuan-Yin is the closest we come to the Christian God though . " " What 's Kuan-Yin , " said Baldwin . She paused , thinking , and Baldwin noticed the pensive melancholy of her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , " she finally replied . " She 's the goddess who hears . She hears people crying or praying wherever they are , and she is the one who gives mercy . She is never angry , she forgives . When a sailor is going down at sea , he prays to Kuan-Yin ; she is the only one who can hear him . When a child is dying , the mother prays to Kuan-Yin , she is the only one who can hear . She gives mercy . Like Mary , perhaps . When I was a child I used to get Mary and Kuan-Yin mixed up . " " Are n't those her temples , " broke in Collins who had been listening intently , " the little temples you see by the roadside , with willows around them and the incense sticks burning , those lovely temples with the yellow and gold ? But I thought she was only a goddess for Buddhists . Did n't she come from Buddhism ? " " Yes , " said the woman , smiling now as at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what you 're really saying is that Buddhism came to China from India . Religion is all mixed up in China . But Kuan-Yin is easy to understand , for she 's mercy and mercy is something everyone understands . It 's not  | really an idea that belongs to India , or to America , or to Christianity , or to anyone particularly . " " Why look , " said Collins , snapping his fingers , almost exploding with excitement , " you 're right ! I never thought of it that way . It 's wonderful , the more you talk things out , the more you find everything fits . You take mercy . That 's what my father says and I never got it . My father is a politician . He used to run a district in Brooklyn . All kinds of people lived in the district , Italians , and Jews , and Irishmen , and Norwegians , and maybe we even had Chinese somewhere there too . He used to say that none of them could understand the courts , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . Everybody comes with his own idea of justice , and too many lawyers have messed around with it . But mercy , he said , mercy belongs to everyone , even if they ca n't speak English , they have the same idea of mercy , they understand it . That 's what makes politics go round , he used to say , mercy not justice . It 's the same wherever they come from , fixing it with the judge if the boy gets in trouble , fixing it with the commissioner if a guy needs a license , fixing a visa for someone whose mother has tuberculosis and wants to come over here from Sicily . That 's the Kuan-Yin stuff . My father would love Kuan-Yin , he 'd be right at home here . " Kwan had silently withdrawn from the conversation as it glided into English and now she was alone with the two Americans . But somber again . " No , " she said very slowly . " No . China 's too big . There are too many of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except a few Chinese . Confucius is more important than Kuan-Yin here , that 's what Colonel Kwan was trying to say . There has to be a government . First you have to have a government , then you have mercy afterwards . "  | She turned to Baldwin and was speaking to him , in the mood of easy friendship they had shared momentarily on the hilltop above the blow . " There 's no time for mercy any more , is there ? " But she was not accusing him now , she was offering to forget . He winced as he remembered the afternoon . There had truly been no time for mercy then , but he had not thought of it that way at the time . He looked at her silently , the warm feeling swelling up in him ungovernably . She understood . He could say it easily . " I 'm sorry I lost my temper up there , " he said . " I just had to do it , you understand do n't you , there was nothing I could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer and in the pause Collins gracefully unfolded himself from the bedroll where he had been sitting , rose and walked away , leaving them . " I was angry , too , " she said , offering apology in return , " but you knew they were there and what you were doing . I see it now . I was angry , I think , about you being an American . When you had to blow it up , you seemed just like everybody else dealing with Chinese . Everything 's happened to us because of other people  --  the Japanese , or the Russians , or the English , or the French . We do n't control ourselves any more . It should have been we who blew the road . I would n't have minded so much if Kwan had blown the road . I know you had to do it . But it was your being American . I 'd thought I 'd forgotten about being American . It 's terrible to love America and be Chinese . I love America . " The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Baldwin did not know how to answer . He loved America , too . But he had never said so aloud in all his life . It was the most private part of his being  --  along with his hopes , and Helen , and daydreaming . It was why he felt so  | embarrassed when , at banquets , the Chinese toasted " China and America is friends . " Awkwardly , he tried to respond and , as he knew he would , he spoiled the mood . " You said you were in America four years , Madame Hung ? " " Please do n't call me Madame Hung , " she replied . " I thought that was the way you should say it , " he said , even more awkwardly . " It is . In Shanghai . All Chinese women call themselves in English Madame Wang , or Madame Chiang , or Madame Hung . But it sounds so French . And Mrs. Wang , or Mrs. Chiang , or Mrs. Hung , sounds worse  --  does n't it ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyi better than Madame Hung if you have to call me anything . Or Su-Piao , just Su-Piao , that 's better . " She was smiling and he saw that beneath the tan of her face , the throat rose in a warm stalk of flawless skin , and that the eyes with the skin-fold over their corners were beautiful . The hair was glistening in the dim glow of the charcoal fire , and he wondered how she would look without the cottonquilt robe . " I had to do it , " he heard himself saying . " I do n't see what else I could have done . " The smile slowly left her face , and she said , " I know . " He got up to go , to get some of the pork-and-gravy which he knew he could now eat with returning appetite . It was only when he turned away , that he realized she had lightly touched his arm , gently , but firmly , forgiving him  --  and that she really did know .  | CHAPTER 6 Death in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his eyes in the murk of the huge room and lay there , for how many minutes he could not tell , his muscles aching as he turned to comfort them , unable to pry himself out of the snug warmth of the bedroll . Gradually , as he stretched , and brought one arm out of the roll , then the other , and opened his eyes , he came awake , and was aware , first , that several of them were up and moving . Then , beyond that , gradually , his ears picked up a strange , muffled hush . " How is it outside ? " he asked Niergaard whom he now saw drinking coffee . " Snowing , " answered Niergaard . " I never knew it snowed in China , real snow . Like home . " Baldwin turned again , his muscles still sore with cramp , jackknifed his body out of the bedroll , and rose to his feet . It was snowing , and he had to add that to the rest of today  | and the decisions crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk until his mouth was clean , and he reached down for the canteen , swished the water through his lips , swallowed . He reached for his toothbrush , scrubbed vigorously , then tucked it back in his bedroll and looked around . Miller and Niergaard had a charcoal fire going and , over the fire , water bubbled in a pot . They offered him coffee , looked at him inquiringly , to which he said only , " Let them sleep awhile , " and went to the door still holding the coffee in his hand . The door opened directly on the dirt main street of the town , and as his mind oriented in the light , he grasped the design of the inn . It was a U-shaped building , and his men occupied one wing of the U. One door of the room in which he stood opened directly on the street , which he faced now ; the side door of the room opened on the courtyard within the U where his trucks were parked . He stepped out , closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the courtyard were timbered and barred and this pleased him , and he turned to look clown the street . Over the town , the snow was quietly falling in a somber white morning silence , muffling the faint noises of the crowded street , padding the sound of every movement . It was a dry snow and must have been falling half the night . But as it sifted down the street in the wind , it left the hardfrozen yellow ruts in the street bare ; it caught on the curl of the tiles in little white ridgclines , designing ripples of white against the clay-red of the roofs . The town was choked as far through the snow-swirl as lie could see  --  wheelbarrows , old rickshaws , a bicycle , pushwagons , Chinese army trucks , all tangled and snarled in the snow , here on the first ledge of the plateau . Some Chinese soldiers , he saw , were awake , working on a truck . As they stalked about the vehicle , he saw their legs naked in the cold , still ulcered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandals sinking into the powdery snow , and he shivered . He sipped the coffee he had brought with him , and heard the door open , then close behind him . Michaelson had come out to join him . Michaelson wanted to speak to him , but was waiting for him to speak first . He was there , Baldwin knew , to get the day 's plot but Baldwin did not have one yet . Yesterday had been solid , and he knew he had a grip on the unit , on the situation , on everything now ; yesterday had been good . It had taken care of VICINITY HOCHIII , he thought . Or had it ? And there remained the DUMPS AT TUSHAN , which were now a growingly-important thing . Should he go right on to Tushan , or check the local command and find what more could be done here ? He knew the men must now be rising and were waiting for him to decide again  --  to prod them out of their frozen weariness on the way , or to hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the job was done and they were going to cut and run for it . But where were the Japanese ? Would they be following on a snow-day like this ? Was it snowing all over the highland ? Or was this a trick snow flurry in a mountain pocket ? There was something else that bothered him . Lewis . He would have to see Lewis quickly and decide about that . Riding in the back of an open truck in the snow would be bad for Lewis . Lewis could use a day in the sack , beside a fire  --  it might be better than rushing him on to the hospital . If Baldwin could find out where the Japanese were , if they were far enough behind , they must certainly be on the other side of the sidehill-blow , then there was time to wait  --  time to investigate what to do here , time to let Lewis linger by the fire . Until it cleared ? For the whole day ? What ? " Good morning , " he said finally to Michaelson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuter 's trip into town .  | " Morning , " said Michaelson . " This snow sure messes up the job . I never knew it snowed in China . " " We 're two thousand feet up now , " said Baldwin , " and it 's November . How are the men ? Any problems ? " " They 're getting up . ' What 's the score for today ? " " I do n't know yet , " said Baldwin . " We 've been traveling without information since the night before last . It depends on the Jap  --  and the snow . It must snow on the Jap just the way it does on us . We could use a day of rest . So could he . I 'd like to let the men rest up today , if we can , because there may be a major job to do at the dumps at Tushan . And they must be tired from yesterday . " " Major , are you planning for us to do that job at Tushan ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented Michaelson 's questioning . But Michaelson pressed on . " That 's a Chinese job , is n't it , that 's their work , is n't it ? " Baldwin was quiet , not knowing how to slap Michaelson down . IIe could have done it if the unit had been together . But alone , in front of the door , just the two of them  --  it was more difficult . Underneath , he knew he had been mistaken when he had said he did n't know what he was going to do today . In command , you had to know . Or give the impression that you did . " Look , Major , " said Michaelson , " that Lewis is real sick , we ca n't take care of him much longer . We 've got to get him to a hospital soon . " " I know , " said Baldwin . " But it is n't going to do him any good hauling him along these roads in the back of an open truck , with the snow coming down this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road snows up and we get stuck here ? " Michaelson was making a debate of it . Baldwin slowly angered . He would not let Michaelson push him . " Listen , Mike , " said Baldwin , " I 'm running this outfit . And  | I 'm not deciding until I 've found out where we stand . There 's a division headquarters here and they ought to have some information . If the Japs are right on our heels , we 'll move . Snow or no snow . If the Japs are stuck down in the valley , we may be able to sit here today and let Lewis and this unit warm up and get rested , and decide Tushan tomorrow . I 'm just as worried about Lewis as you are , and a day in bed may give him just what he wants to lick it . Go in and make sure he 's fixed up with what he needs now . As soon as I get some information , I 'll let you know what the orders are . " He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yesterday , half-waited for Michaelson to challenge him again , but Michaelson went back inside . Now he had to find the division headquarters , which meant he needed Kwan , and Collins for the translation . He found Kwan , warming his fingers at the charcoal fire , standing , as usual , ramrod-stiff among the slouched and shuffling Americans . Kwan nodded at Baldwin 's questions and suggested , through Collins , that they go looking for headquarters as soon as they had eaten . When they emerged from the inn , the town had long since begun to rustle with the sluggish movements of morning . From wherever they had been sleeping , the refugees had begun to crawl out into the open street  --  out from the eaves , out from the hovels , out from under trucks , out from under the arcades and quivering mat-sheds that leaned against the adobe walls of the houses . And now they were trying to warm themselves . From somewhere in the city , from a warehouse , or an army store , they had taken straw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plats of straw where people sat , or yellow-brown tufts of straw which they were burning to warm themselves . It was bitterly cold ; he could see the plumes of vapor from their breath . Yet the jostle of the peu-  | ple gave the illusion of warmth about them as they walked . At first , Baldwin was not aware of what he was seeing . It was the man lying across the wheelbarrow that the young fellow was pushing who first struck him as curious . The man was dressed in rags and his knees were bare halfway up the thighs , and he lay across the squealing , screeching wheelbarrow face down , his head , with its matted hair , jiggling and bobbing to the wheelbarrow 's bumping . As the wheelbarrow drew nearer , the jiggling seemed stranger until it became obvious that it was not a man , but a body , unstrung and dead . After that , as they walked , Baldwin looked more closely and saw there were many dead . A woman lay stiff and grotesquely flat in the gutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling on her face was melting so that her cheeks dripped , but the snow remained white and dry on her eyes so that it seemed her eyes were wadded with cotton . Another woman , making the first loud sound of the morning , sat on a straw mat with a bundle swaddled in red silk that might have been a doll , but was a baby . ' t'lic baby was dead , too , and the woman was keening , her voice reaching for the high shrill of the sopranohysterical and then tumbling down through the octaves and rising again in a trill . The sound of madness in her voice hurried them past her and they had walked beyond her before Baldwin realized lie should have done something or , at least , felt sorry . They were all going to die , Baldwin slowly realized , all of them , or most of them , and he was outside it , he could not feel it because he had trucks , food , men , gasoline back there at the inn compound . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned , of course , why leave clothes on a dead body when people are freezing , of course . He noticed a man with a child 's sweater buttoned around his head like a shawl , to keep his ears from freezing , and others had towels ,  | or undergarments , or fur wrapped around their heads , and they moved , when they did move , with a gentle stagger through the street , as creatures in a herd moved . Some sat on their straw , and he saw a woman nursing a baby from a flat brown breast that hung like a flap of skin bared against the cold ; the woman cried as she nursed , putting the nipple back in the mouth when the child turned away to howl . Another woman sat in the snow , a man 's head in her lap , her hands slowly stroking his cheeks , back and forth , caressing them , soothing them , pressing them as if she were in the privacy of her bedroom ; and two little boys sat beside her , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the skull . Baldwin , Kwan , and Collins walked almost on tiptoe , not speaking to each other , not wanting to draw attention by talking , knowing they were here , in the presence of death , intruding on last intimacies which they should not be seeing . The three walked slowly , for they did not want to appear to be hurrying , or people might follow them ; we are too fat , thought Baldwin , seeing himself through the eyes of the people of Hochih as obscene . He asked Kwan how far it was to the divisional headquarters and Kwan said it was just beyond those people there , where the three trucks were . The people there , where Kwan pointed , were huddled and growling animal-like in lust about something big that lay on the ground . As the three drew abreast they saw it was the carcass of a horse and the knot of refugees were chipping away at it with knives . The skin had already been taken off and now the layers of white gristle and cherry-red flesh were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a huge misshapen onion that the busy , dirty fingers were peeling . The skeleton of a mule , likewise stripped , lay further down the road , its entrails discarded , its eyes gouged out , its skeleton protruding .  | Over all and everything fell the snow , muffling the sounds through which , constantly , Baldwin could hear or thought he could hear the soft sounds of crying and moaning . Two sentries at the divisional headquarters passed Kwan and the two Americans through to an inner room , where they met the general . It was like no headquarters Baldwin had ever seen before , even in China . It was dirty , which was rare , he knew , in a Chinese headquarters , and the cadaverous , melancholy man who was introduced to them scarcely rose from his chair in the courtesy greeting . Scrawny , his face yellower than any man Baldwin had ever seen , the general offered them tea with hands that shook and quivered . The room stank  --  of garlic and body odor and something sticky-sweet that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they sat down and saw Collins sniffing , too . Collins leaned toward him and said , " Opium . " It was the first time Baldwin had smelled opium . His gorge rose , then he bound himself to the business at hand . The inevitable , slow questioning followed the tea  --  from Baldwin through Collins through Kwan to the general . Then the long pause before the general started his answer on the long return . This was the general who had traded them rooms at the inn last night in return for the gasoline for his car . He was neither hostile nor friendly in any way that Baldwin could make out . He simply did not care , and Baldwin remembered last night 's conversation , and Kwan 's contempt for this Ssuchuan division . He was waiting , said the general , as the conversation wound back and forth , for information . Iic had no information . No one told him anything . His information came by jeep courier , or by horse , from Tushan where the Central Army had a head- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No radio . No telephone . Wires cut . Yesterday the general had been told that Ishan was fallen to the Japanese ; or was on the point of falling . The general pulled out an old-fashioned Chinese map with its ink lines of elevation and pointed . A dirty fingernail pointed out several Chinese characters on the map and said , " Liuchow . " Then , again pointed and said , " Ishan . " Baldwin tried to assemble the scraps of meager information into a pattern . They did not help . If the Japanese were at Ishan , then they had come fifty miles from Liuchow . The Japs had , therefore , already crossed the bridge Baldwin had futilely blown on Wednesday . But they could not have passed the road-cut he had made yesterday . Not in any force . The Jap was coming  --  but to seize and occupy , or to raid and reconnoiter ? The general went on . So , last night , he had sent his own jeep to Tushan to ask for instructions and find out what was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . By noontime , the general corrected himself . Certainly by two o'clock . Or before dark . Maybe soon . The general went back to the map , sweeping both hands back and forth over it , sullenly , as if he were personally aggravated . There were two Japanese divisions , the Third and the Thirteenth , said the general . The Third was the division coming up the road . The general knew about it . But where was the Thirteenth that was circling in a sweep through the hills ? The Third could not get to Hochih up the road for another two days , thought the general . Or maybe they could . But what about the Japanese Thirteenth ? Where was it ? What was he supposed to do ? Should he wait ? The Japanese would certainly take Hochih . But when ?  | Baldwin had lost control of the conversation now , and Collins , too , was being left behind by the flow of Chinese between Kwan and the Ssuchuanese . For the Ssuchuanese was now openly complaining to Kwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Army , Baldwin remembered from the night before , which had tricked this division out of the warm , fertile basin of Ssuchuan . It was Central which had liquidated the warlord to whom this division belonged and sent the division tramping over the hills for all these months to arrive here , nowhere , in the merciless cold of the Kweichou border , in the torrent of retreat , to become the last organized unit between the barrier and the enemy . Not understanding , Baldwin could look closely at the Ssuchuanese . The sallow , drawn face of the man had the furtive , hunted look of a rabbit . The man was lost . Something had been drained from him which command should have , which Colonel I , i had had yesterday , which Kwan had , which an officer has . His vitality was gone . He had lost or never had the essential purpose of the warrior which was to impose his will on other people , making them submit to what his command and wind dictated . The whine , the querulousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far behind , said the general , he knew between Kweiyang and ' I'ushan , the Central Army was making a new line . They were bringing new Central troops from the Chinese army in Burma by air up into Kweichou to make a new line  --  the American planes were bringing them . The Central troops would have a line and they would have American guns . But they would leave him here until it was too late . Or they would tell him to go into guerrilla action . Out of the stumbling heaviness of the opium-blown sloth , an anger began to come alive in the Ssuchuanese . How could he go to guerrilla action ? There was no food in the mountains . The  | people in the mountains hated men from Ssuchuan . His Ssuchuan men did not even speak the same tongue as the mountain people . How could they get food ? Where would they get ammunition ? What could they do here ? Yet he could not go back until he got orders or until the Japanese came . As Baldwin followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the man was useless , to be discarded from any calculation . There was no point in spinning out this conversation . This general could offer neither advice , nor strength , nor help ; nothing but whatever scrap of information might be sent on to him from Tushan this afternoon . Baldwin decided to break it up , and , using Collins , breaking in on one of the Ssuchuanese 's sentences , he said : " Tell him we 'll check back with him about two to see if he has any fresh information on the Japs from Tushan headquarters , " and then realizing he wanted at least the appearance of friendship and the hope of cooperation for the rest of the day , he added , " Ask him if there 's anything we can do to help him ? " " This afternoon , " said the Ssuchuanese , " this afternoon perhaps I will know . I will know if they do not forget me . But they will forget . Come back . " Then , in an afterthought : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give some soldiers . Have the Americans any more gasoline they do not want ? " It was another trade , and Baldwin did not want it . " No , " he said , " we have just enough gasoline for ourselves . " " Or wrist watches ? " said the general , " or fountain pens ? Or tires ? " Kwan snarled in exasperation and anger ; and the general 's face relaxed into its melancholy , half-childish expression of hurt as he accompanied them back to the door .  | " He is no use . He is finished , " said Kwan as they walked back . " Yes , " said Baldwin , " he is finished . " " Not all Chinese soldiers are like that , " said Kwan , " only now at the end of the war , we must use men like these . They are warlord soldiers for fighting warlord wars , or for fighting peasants . They are not soldiers for fighting big wars . But we had soldiers for fighting big wars once , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Americans in Burma . We will have good soldiers again , but first we must have a government , without a government soldiers can not fight . This is what the Generalissimo is trying to do , to make a government so the soldiers can fight . Maybe he is too late , maybe he does not know . But these soldiers here do not belong to him . They do not belong to anybody . That is why they can not fight . " Michaelson met them at the inn . " Lewis is real sick , " he said , " he 's boiling . " " Oh , " said Baldwin . For a full clay the condition of Lewis had been nagging at him under all the decisions he had had to make , and now the death outside reminded him that life was frail , and Lewis was sick and he was responsible . " I 'll take a look at him , " he said , and then , " Tell the men to knock off this morning . We have to lay over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them sack out if they want to , they can all use some rest . But tell them to stay in the inn , or in the courtyard . I do n't want them out in that street until we leave . If they get restless , let 's make sure the trucks are ready for this afternoon . Put them to work on the engines . " He walked over to Lewis . In the dark room , cold yet stuffy with the smell of the bodies that had slept in it , stale with the  | air breathed over and over through the night , Lewis lay quietly in a bedroll , and Su-Piao sat beside him on the k'ang , the high , brick , Chinese bed-rest . She was dipping a face rag in a bowl of steaming water in her lap and mopping Lewis ' face . Baldwin 's own flesh tingled as he watched ; he sensed his eye muscles strain and the jaw muscles of his face tighten , aching for fingers to stroke and soothe them . The touch of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman stroking her dying husband 's face in the street  --  she could do no more , but she had been speaking . The children holding hands in the cold outside , they were speaking . He wished her hands could touch him . Then he spoke to Lewis . " Lewis ? " he said , " Lewis , how are you ? " Lewis barely stirred . From his bedroll came the highpitched voice , weak and soft . " I do n't know , Major , I do n't feel good . " " What 's the matter , Lewis  --  your stomach ? Or your head ? Is it like malaria ? " " I do n't know , Major , but I feel weak all over , just .. . just , I feel as if I ca n't lift my head . I feel shivery like malaria  --  but it 's different this time . My bones ache . And this fever , it does n't come and go the way malaria does . It just stays and stays and I feel lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . but I 'm shivery , too . " Su-Piao shifted on the k'ang beside Lewis and said , " I 'll get some water . " " When are we going to get some place , Major , " asked Lewis . " In a day or so , Lewis , maybe tomorrow we 'll be in Kweiyang . We 're laying over here this morning until we find out where the Japs are .. We may stay all day and give you a chance to get some rest under a roof . "  | " If you 're laying over just because of me , Major , I 'd rather get out of here . I 'm not going to get better until we get out . " With difficulty Baldwin suppressed his indignation . " We 'll get you to Kweiyang , Lewis , do n't worry , " he said . " We have to find out where the Jap is before we can make the next move . It 's snowing today and we ca n't make any time . We might get stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the snow would be bad for you . You take it easy , now , try to sleep . . . . " It was like talking to a child . But the man was sick . " I never knew it snowed in China , " mumbled Lewis . Su-Piao was back with a canteen cup of water . " Yes , it does , " said Baldwin , " real snow . I 'll get some aspirins for you to take with the water . It 'll be good for the fever . " Su-Piao lifted Lewis ' head , and let him sip the water . She fed him several aspirins , gave him another sip , and let him rest once more . Baldwin waited for her to get up , then followed her to the bench on which she sat down , and sat beside her . " I think he has typhus , " she said . " Typhus ? That 's bad , is n't it ? What makes you think so ? " " His fever . The way it stays steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . rllat 's when typhus comes . We 've lost more soldiers to typhus than to the Japanese . It usually comes when a man is completely exhausted . A louse bites him some night as he sleeps , and he 's infected ; then , three or four days later his fever starts to burn . I do n't know whether anything helps . Maybe penicillin would . We 've never tried that . Have you any penicillin with you ? " " We 've got some capsules in the kit , somewhere . " " But no syringe , nothing to inject it with , no ampoule ? " " No. "  | " Oral penicillin does n't do any good , I read somewhere ; I think it should be given intravenously . " " You know a lot about this , do n't you ? " " I should . I 've worked in hospitals quite a bit . " " Hospitals ? " " Officers ' wives look after hospitals in our army , at the war fronts , away from Chungking . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after hospitals in Chungking . And T'ung-ling  --  my husband  --  tried hard to make our hospital a good one . " " Where did you learn about them ? " " Only what I learned at the Red Cross , in the beginning , at Shanghai . We lived in the French concession there and when the Japanese began shelling the Chinese city , we were furious . All my friends joined the Red Cross and we made bandages and took first-aid courses . You could stand on the roof of our apartment house and look out at the fighting in the Chinese city , and see the Japanese shelling the trenches and the houses . But the French concession was so safe , the Japs respected foreign flags then , that some of us could n't stand it . We used to sneak out of the concession and go to the hospitals in the Chinese city , and try to help the wounded . We were all so patriotic then . " " I remember that Shanghai fight , " said Baldwin . " That was seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it back home . " " We used to get the American papers and magazines in Shanghai , too , and they said we were wonderful . It all seemed so romantic in pictures . But they used to bring the soldiers into the hospitals with their feet rotting from the trench water in Chapei . They 'd stay in the hospital for two days and their feet would heal  --  or they 'd die . There were men with arms torn off , men with scalps ripped off , and dysentery and typhus.  | In those days , we still had medicines , not penicillin of course , that was back in 1937 , but we had the sulfa drugs , they were new then , do you remember ? " " Yes , " said Baldwin , remembering how long ago sulfa drugs seemed , and how old this war must be for her which started in 1937 . But she was remembering , too . " Then , when T'ung-ling and I got married , I went off with his unit in the retreat , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives tried to help at the hospitals . The headquarters ' hospital was mostly for the rear troops ; the soldiers who got back from the front were starvation cases , the wounded died on the way . And the little hospitals near the front . Some of them had herb doctors , with their thousand-year-old ideas . You know  --  fever comes from hot winds in the belly , so eat cold food . Stomach ache or cramps are bad winds , so eat belch medicine ; and opium syrup for everything . And for sore throats , eat rotting bean curd , moldy bean curd . The funny thing was that a lot of their medicines worked . The moldy bean curd , for example . I 've heard some of our doctors say we discovered penicillin first because penicillin is only a mold , too . We did n't argue with them , because we did n't have any penicillin anyway , only enough for the staff officers and their families . Look , if you have some of these oral penicillin capsules , why do n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Baldwin got up , went out to the trucks , rummaged around in the medical kit until he found the flask of capsules . Then he hoisted a case of mountain rations on his shoulder for investigation and came back in . When he had given Lewis two of the capsules , he set the case of rations down before Su-Piao and sat down beside her . There was nothing to do but wait , and it was better to be asking questions of her , than be with the men who would be asking questions of him .  | He slit the case of rations open with a long knife and began to pull out the packages . " There may be something in here we can prepare for him that 'll make him feel better , " said Baldwin , " this is the army 's top field ration . " They began to unpack the carton , pulling the containers out one by one  --  the meat cans , the butter cans , the cereals , the pudding cans , the sourballs , cheese , sugar packets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at her . It was an American smile on her face , almost girlish . He had never heard her giggle the Chinese giggle , he realized . That 's what makes them different from us , he told himself  --  the giggle , or the knee jiggling , or hysterics when they get angry , or the frozen face when they withdraw from you . She was American . " Something funny ? " he asked . " No , " she said , and then , " Well , yes . It is fun to look at these again . It 's been so long . I grew up on American food even before I went to America . Our family comes from up north , in Anhui , where we have land , but father owned these apartment houses in the French concession , in Shanghai , where I was born . Father was so proud of his American friends and his American house . We had Americans at home visiting all the time  --  insurance people , banking people , shipping people . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk from the American dairy in Shanghai . We had Christmas with the turkey , and Thanksgiving with the cranberry sauce . My father was so Americanized that he was hurt when the American consul would n't invite him to the Fourth of July party for Americans . He thought the consul was being anti-Chinese . Oh , see ! " she ended abruptly . In the carton at her knees she had found a brown waxed box . " Mashed potatoes , " she said .  | " Dehydrated mashed potatoes , " Baldwin pointed out . " Almost all this stuff is dehydrated . If you open it you 'll find it looks like white soap chips , and when you put water in it , it tastes like dust . " But she was already playing house . She had piled several little tinfoil envelopes by her side . " Here 's chicken broth , and here 's beef broth , " she said . " They 're both good for him . And then there 's this can of dehydrated cheese , and the butter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese and butter  --  it should taste fine . But first we 'll give him some broth . " " Fine , " said Baldwin , " you take over . You can be Florence Nightingale . But let 's wait until about noon when everyone eats . If we have to leave after eating , that way they 'll all have had at least one hot meal today . " He looked across the room . Several of the men were playing red-dog on the floor , two were dozing . Miller was doing nothing . " Miller , " he called , and Miller looked at him in response . " Miller , we 'll cat about noontime . Get another carton of rations off the trucks and fix up something hot and good for everybody while there 's time . And then give a hand to Madame Hung , here ; she 's going to make something special for Lewis . " " O.K. , " said Miller , and then shifted his beefy body about uneasily . " Say , Major , that Lewis , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think there 's a doctor here in this joint ? " " No , " said Baldwin , " no doctor closer than Kweiyang , but we 'll take care of him . " They were more than a hundred miles from a doctor , from clean beds , medicine , from someone who knew . Baldwin had never been so far from a doctor in his life . Being so far from a doctor made him feel naked . But they had to wait .  | Then , because it was Miller , the agreeable , he was talking to , he offered a part explanation . " That 's why we 're laying over here today , to keep him out of the cold and the snow . If we put Lewis on the back of one of these trucks in the snow , he 'd have a bad time of it . " " Yeah , " said Miller , " that 's right , the snow would give him a bad time . Then , when it stops , we can go right on through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . They were all pushing him on , to get in to Kweiyang and safety . But he knew he must not be pushed now , he must make the decision when he knew where he was . And tomorrow was Tushan , where the big one was . For some reason , he did not want to do Tushan today . " We 'll see how Lewis is when the snow stops , " he said firmly , knowing that Miller would carry the thought back to the other men . It was best to pin the delay on Lewis . They had eaten lunch and it was now almost one o'clock . The smell of food mixed with the smell of bodies , but no one noticed . Though their bellies were full and heavy , a nervous indolence twitched them all , some pacing , some talking , Michaelson and Collins needling each other , the inaction scratching at all of them . Baldwin felt he should do something , and ordered the room policed . Idly , they fell to , piling the leftover food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the open tins of butter , the unopened cereals and jam back into the big cartons which were now overspilling in disorder . Outside , finally , the snow was ending . Every now and then someone would open the door to peer out , leaving the door open for the welcome burst of fresh air which cut the heavy stuffiness of the . room , then slamming it shut when the cold began to flood in , overwhelming the little heat from the char-  | coal fires . The last time the door had been opened , there was no doubt but that the snow was ending  --  it fluttered down in occasional gusts , but it was thin , and in the gusts it was difficult to tell whether the snow was falling from the sky or being lifted from the powder drifts in the street . The snow was no longer much reason for lingering , and Baldwin felt it was time to check the Ssuchuanese headquarters again . They were only seventy miles from Tushan and they ought to push on  --  at least part way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will you ask him , " he said to Su-Piao , " if he can go back to that divisional headquarters and see if their courier has arrived yet ? Or any other word from Tushan . We 'll be pushing on soon anyway , but I want to know what the word is . " Kwan was back within the hour , long before Baldwin expected him . He was out of breath , holding on to his dignity with an effort . " Go back , " said Kwan , " now everyone goes back . The courier says the army at Tushan wants everyone to go back because the Japanese are coming . " " When ? " said Baldwin . " They do not know . But the army has decided the Japanese will take Hocliih . Mc Japanese Third Division moved up the road last night , with cavalry . The Japanese Thirteenth Division is north of the road and will start for Hochih soon . " " Both divisions ? Two whole Japanese divisions ? " Baldwin could not conceive of two divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of the lowlands to the winter here with no transition . Unless they had planned , really , to seize the highlands . Did they ? " This general does not know how many . He does not know much . The army has told him only they will not fight for Hochih , that he should go back quickly to Tushan . This gen-  | eral will go quickly , before the army changes its meaning and makes him stay and fight guerrilla battles . This general does not want to fight . He will go first himself , today , in his few trucks , and his soldiers will walk after him , slowly . " " And Tushan ? " said Baldwin . " Tushan is only seventy miles away , there are Central troops in Tushan . But they will go back , too . They will meet the new divisions from Burma near Tuyun , in the hills between Kweiyang and Tushan . They will make a new front there . " " Will the headquarters still be there when we get to Tu-shan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know . The army at Tushan would not tell such a thing to this general . They do not trust him . " Baldwin let the information roll around in his mind . It was not clear . Nothing had been clear since they left Liuchow . He was tired of making up his mind in a fog . He did not know how fresh the general 's information was . In an army without radio or telephone , dependent on couriers , the information might be a day old . Or it might be false , the Central Government might be trapping the Ssuchuan general . It was a madness , thought Baldwin , there were several wars going on at once here . There were the Ssuchuan troops in this town fighting in some past century , on foot , with rifles thirty years old , and old French pack howitzers , their commander an opium sot , dependent on messenger-couriers , almost as antique as General Grant 's army , except that it was worse be . cause the Ssuchuanese distrusted their command , their government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who had begun the war with an air force , a navy , a mechanized army , electronics . And outward on the Pacific they still faced the Americans with air  | force , navy , radar , radio , guns , and were being punished and crushed . So that here they were turning inward on Asia in an older kind of war , moving on foot , on horse , like Jeb Stuart 's calvalry , punishing China because America was strangling Japan . And there would be more people dying on this one road , of hunger , of cold , and sickness , than would die in all the battles of the Pacific . This was the old-fashioned killing , the dirty bloodless killing of women and children and refugees , the oldfashioned war in which he was trapped . And then , ahead of him somewhere , if the general 's rumor were true , reaching around the awkward distances of India , of Buena , of the Hump and the Himalayas , the U.S. Air Force was ferrying fresh Chinese troops into battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans had trained and brought from the last century into this , new units who had learned to fight with American planes , radios , artillery , medicine . Somewhere up ahead , the new armies that Americans were building up for China would meet the dwindling ferocity of the old Japanese horse cavalry . And as Japanese energy ran down , as the Jap capacity to supply ran out , they would come to a deadlock with the new troops and the plateau would be safe . But in-between was where he was right now , seeing everything come apart . And he could sway it a little bit . The Ssuchuanese general would be out by night and , of course , the Ssuchuanese general would not burn Hochih as he left . Hochih should be burned so that the Jap cavalry could not shelter in it . It could be flamed , not easily now that the snow had wet it , but flamed nonetheless . But to flame it was a Chinese job . To flame it , meant leaving the dying in the snow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the highlands to find no shelter . Casually Baldwin wondered whether he was responsible for burning it , and the  | thought ended : The hell with it . He would get out fast , the way the Ssuchuanese general was going to get out . He would get on to Tushan , close on the rear , leave the idiot war to the Chinese , letting them wreck their own country in their own way ; he was responsible only for the road ; and possibly for Tushan if the headquarters there wanted him to be . " Michaelson ! " he yelled . Michaelson came . " We 're moving now , " he said . " Snow 's over . The Japanese are coming . We 're getting out . Are the trucks ready ? " " That Lewis job , she wo n't start . We 've worked on her all morning , but she 's worse than she was yesterday . She 's dead . " " The hell with it . Leave it , " said Baldwin . " Off-load what gear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auxiliary motor . Dump what you have to , to make room . Fix Lewis up comfortably in the back of your truck . Get him as many blankets as you can dig up . " They moved fast . Soon he could hear the big six-by-sixes churning their motors . The men came in one by one to get their bedrolls , moving with force and vigor , for the morning 's rest had helped them . Even Baldwin felt better , now that he had decided . It was almost over . Then Collins was approaching him , and Baldwin smiled because he knew that Collins was with him . " We 're going on to Tushan , " said Baldwin , " and the dumps . There 's no point in wrecking this town ; if the Chinese want to burn it , they 'll have to do it themselves . " " I always hate this part of it , " said Collins , unhurriedly , " pulling out and leaving them behind . I know we ca n't take any of them with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was worse than anything I 've seen all summer . It 's like giving these people over to death . I wonder what they think of when they see us go . "  | " I know , " said Baldwin , realizing that it was because of the people in the street , not because he was tired , that he did not want to burn it . " Say , " said Collins , nudging the overflowing food cartons on the floor with his boot , " are we going to load these , too ? " " Why ? " asked Baldwin . " I was just thinking , " said Collins , " we have enough rations in the trucks for a week or more . And the jokers in the street are starving . We 'll probably dump this stuff on the way , anyway . How about distributing it to them out there ? " Baldwin suddenly knew that Collins was suggesting expiation . The boy shifted from the slick to the soft , from the shrewd to the emotional , so easily ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . He was suggesting expiation for the people killed at the blow , for the old man left at the gap , for the leper at Liuchow , for being well fed and on wheels while the people they had seen in the cold , crowded streets this morning would remain to die . The food would save few , there was so little . But it might save one or two . The biscuits , and butter and cereals and condensed milk might nourish a few bellies for the night , so they could die farther up the road . But not on his Conscience . " O.K. , " he said , " but do n't waste any time . " Awkwardly , Collins hoisted one carton on his shoulder and moved out , through the door that opened on the street . Miller came in to rouse Lewis on the k'ang . Lewis rose , motioned to his bedroll , which Miller shouldered , then staggered after Miller to the trucks , through the side door that opened on the courtyard . Collins returned for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty except for Baldwin and Su-Piao . " Where is he going with that ? " she asked sharply . " We 're leaving it for the refugees , " said Baldwin , knowing she would approve , and glad that Collins had suggested it .  | Instead , her face frowned , and she said sharply : " Oh , no ! Call him back . " The alarm in her voice startled him . " Why ? " he asked . " It 's dangerous , " she said . " Oh do n't ! " He realized as soon as she spoke that there was danger . But everything was dangerous . It was a kindness that Collins was trying to do ; he wished Collins were here to explain it , he could not say the words of kindness the way Collins might . " What 's dangerous ? " he said in a cold voice , his face hardening . " Giving food away ? We ca n't eat it . " He groped and came up with a thought . " You were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , or leave them food . It 's all the same . But I want to leave them food . " She angered him . She was Chinese , these were her people . She should approve ; but she said , " Refugees are dangerous . You do n't understand China . They 're starving . If we leave the food in here , they can loot the place as soon as we 've gone . Oh , please , stop him ! " Outside , muffled by the door , he heard a sudden noise rise , a murmur and growling , punctuated by yells , then shrieking and a howling . Baldwin rushed to the side door and looked at the courtyard . The Americans were there , he noticed , standing alertly , listening to the tumult beyond the barred gates of the inn . " Where 's Collins ? " yelled Baldwin . " Ai n't he in there with you ? " asked Ballo . " Where is he ? " Outside , the din and shouting grew . Baldwin unslung the carbine from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbines , " he shouted . " Open those gates . " As the timbered gates swung slowly inwards , parting to show  | what lay outdoors , it was as if a curtain rose on a stage . In the foreground , a mass of bodies squirmed and twisted in a tangle of forms out of which legs kicked away in the air , arms rose and fell , shoulders thrust up and crumpled again under more bodies that flung themselves on top of the growing mound . From out of the pile , a little boy was running away , dancing , holding a can of butter in his hand . A man shot out a claw , snatched the butter from him and ran off down the street faster than the boy could chase . On top of the pile now , a woman in a smeared pink dressing gown stamped with her heels in the small of someone else 's back , trying to dig down through the mass of bodies to the cartons that lay underneath . From down the street came others , the fast-of-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin leveled the carbine over their heads and fired into the air . Michaelson and Prince were beside him and he was ordering , " Over their heads , over their heads , into the air , Collins is underneath , over their heads . " And they were volleying . A shriek sliced through the growling of voices and Baldwin heard Michaelson grunting , " Winged one ! " Then , dissolving , the tangle began to unsnarl itself , the edges unraveling , the animals becoming people , standing up , running away , leaving a space of snow and mud , littered with torn cardboard , packages , tins and strewn food . And in the blank and littered filth of gray and white , lay Collins . Collins did not move . In one outstretched hand a can slowly dropped from his fingers and Baldwin saw it was a can of sardines . Baldwin stared at the body , his stunned mind slowly grasping that the neck of the boy twisted awkwardly from his shoulders and the round of his head seemed oddly shaped . " Cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked across the snow , and stooped . There was a rock beside the  | head , and the light-brown hair was matted with blood , and the rock with which the head had been bashed in was covered with blood , too . Baldwin wanted to touch the head , to smooth the wound ; he noticed that Collins ' cheeks were shaved , the only man who shaved , he wanted to touch them , too . But he could not , it was over . Like that . Through the quivering of rage in his body , through the fear , through the numbness as he tried to absorb what was happening , as his mind spun , Baldwin found himself trying to reason with the hate that rose in him . It was because they were hungry . It was because Collins was at the bottom . It was n't because Collins was American . Whoever held the rock and was hammering his way through other Chinese to the food had not meant to kill an American because he was American . He had only meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fair made no difference . They had killed Collins because they were beasts . He hated them because he had not been able to keep the vital , fragile distance between his men and the refugees , because you could not be kind to them . He walked back to the courtyard gates , very slowly , not wanting to scuttle back in the sight of the mob or of his men . Michaelson and Prince were still there , facing out with their guns , covering him ; behind on the jeep 's hood , stood Ballo with his gun . " I want to bring him in , " said Baldwin . " Niergaard and Miller , get out there and carry him in . We 're covering . " Baldwin walked out with Niergaard and Miller as they lifted the body and brought it back to the courtyard . And as he walked back , he became aware that they were still there , behind him , hungry , growling and rumbling to get back at the food which now , as the cartons had ruptured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching Collins ' lips with her fingers , lifted  | the wrist , felt for the pulse , stood crouched for a moment , then shook her head . " Oh the frigging Chinese , " said Miller almost to himself . " Oh the bastards . " Kwan spoke softly in Chinese and Su-Piao frowned . " What did he say ? " asked Baldwin , hoping that some magic phrase in Chinese had passed between them that could erase what had just happened . " He says , let us go now quickly . The shots will bring some of the soldiers here . He says the soldiers have guns and they are as hungry as the refugees . If they know we have food here , we can not stop them . If we shoot , they will shoot back . He says go now , quickly . " But Baldwin was already moving the convoy into formation , his orders snapping flatly , efficiently , coming off the top of his mind while somewhere the same mind groped to accept what had happened , and what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath , the ache he knew would return . The jeep first , he ordered , impersonal and brisk , Michaelson riding the hood to fire cover . Miller on the second truck , with Lewis in the blankets behind . Ballo next . Niergaard driving the last truck , carrying Collins ' body , with Prince to fall back from the gate and ride the back firing rear-cover . They were ready to roll now . Baldwin lowered the flat windshield of the jeep flush with the hood . It gave a clearer field of sight if he had to shoot , and no glass to splinter if the crowd threw rocks . Baldwin moved behind the wheel of the jeep , noticed and was angry that Kwan and Su-Piao were already in place without being asked , called to Prince still standing at the gate , with Michaelson , holding the crowd at its distance with their carbines .  | " Prince ! " Baldwin called from the jeep as his motor raced and the other trucks sounded behind him . " Fall back now . Tell every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one of these Chinese edges in between , keep going . Do n't stop . You get on Niergaard 's truck , in the back . You fire rear-cover . ' When you 're ready to go back there , fire two shots , and we take off . Mike , " he continued , yelling to the burly back that stood guard at the courtyard gates , " when you hear Prince fire twice , hop back to the hood of the jeep and be ready to shoot when we roll . " He waited for the seconds it took Prince to get back to Niergaard 's truck , gazing at the mob which held its distance , roaring with desire and discontent . There were no faces he could see , only the large encircling arc of people , half-mooned about the entrance , dressed in grays and blues , rags and woolens , heads covered with old towels , shawls , handkerchiefs , fedoras . They were not people at all , he told himself , but a giant beast , swaying and pulsing like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear . They had killed Collins and none of them was responsible . They could not care that Collins was dead any more than they could care for one of their own Chinese dead that he and Collins had seen this morning . It was a pack . It was not human . The pack had a personality . And he hated it , hated it . Behind him , he heard Prince 's carbine fire twice and he fed gas to the jeep as Michaelson , never lowering his carbine , backed aboard , and then fired over the heads of the mob several times for warning . Baldwin twisted the wheel as he emerged from the gates . He could feel it crunch over the cartons , mashing the food into the ground , knowing the trucks behind would mash what was left and not caring . The crowd thinned and parted , and he moved out , the trucks following . The convoy was in the clear now , slowly gathering speed  | when a figure darted out at them from the side , a figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling , whether to curse or beg for a ride , Baldwin could not tell . But he saw Michaelson 's carbine go up again and shoot pointblank into the running figure and it tumbled awkwardly , like a football dummy carried to the ground . Baldwin noticed as it fell that the soldier had been running barefoot in the snow . Behind he could hear Prince 's gun on the last truck blasting off in a volley , and then they were out of it . The last he saw of Hochih was a little girl gaily waving at them , and the mother 's hand reaching out to snatch her back . They drove a minute or two in silence and Baldwin turned to speak to Collins , but Collins was not there , only the two Chinese and Michaelson up front on the hood . He wanted to talk about it with Collins , only with Collins . He was conscious now of many things as the fright of the flight ebbed from him , that anger was hardening in him , that the boy had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool . Because I was a fool , Collins is dead . I was responsible . It was all right for him to have the idea , thought Baldwin . But it was not right for me to let him go . I was responsible . The flattened windshield was still down , and Baldwin was beginning to be cold , his fingers were numbing at the wheel , and Michaelson must be freezing up there . But he could not stop now because if he stopped he would be sick , he would not be able to stand up , he wanted to throw up . He must keep driving just a few more minutes until his hands stopped shaking . And what were they going to do next ? He could not think about it . IIe would stop in just a minute and when they stopped he would figure it out . If he had gone out with Loomis it would not have happened ; he had wanted to go out by road , to do this job .  | CHAPTER 1 Evening in a Blockhouse WHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convoy to let Michaelson and Prince out of the cold and back into the cabs of their trucks . But he was still not sure enough of himself to try his voice . For now , with only three trucks behind him , he realized one carried a man close to death , and the other a lad just dead , and he could not think of the one just dead , still warm , even through the numbness , without the choke rising in his throat and a wanting to cry . He knew that no man in command cries , and that even a junior lieutenant on patrol in the night must bring back bodies without crying . But beyond the death was somehow a deeper personal sorrow , and , aching with it , knowing he had asked for this command , he tried to think of what he must do next , and could not , and was aware that he was alone in a jeep with two Chinese , and he did not want Chinese close to him . If I wish , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by  | the side of the road , and force them out to join the gray-blue living ghosts streaming , mile by mile , up the road toward death in the snow , and they would probably die too . But , as bitterness toyed with the thought , came the realization that he needed her , now . With Collins gone , the team was tongueless in China . He had no words of Chinese and she would be the only link , for as long as they stayed on the road , between what he wanted and the strange Chinese army and the lost millions of Chinese he must deal with . He drove silently and slowly for even though the snow had thinned the flow of refugees , he had no taste for hurry . The dark was falling , he observed soon , and he reminded himself that it was November , that they were high , and dark came quickly when it was cold . But he could not trust himself to speak yet , not knowing whether his voice would break in a sob or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the road , running beside them , its tongue out , and automatically , flatly , his voice said : " A clog . " Su-Piao answered , softly . " No , I think it 's a wolf , it 's following us . " " I thought wolves were thin , " he said , testing his voice further , " that 's a husky one . " " Yes , " said Su-Piao . " It 's been eating well . I 've never seen a wolf before , I thought they were only in stories . " Baldwin let the jeep speed a bit , and the wolf fell behind down the file of the convoy . Behind , lie could hear a shot ring out . Then another . That must be Michaelson , or Prince , with their guns still ready , firing at the wolf and Baldwin knew their carbines were still on the trigger and they were triggerhappy . Once you fired a gun , you unlocked something inside a man , and then it took enormous pressure to lock it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears came , you could  | not stop a woman from crying unless you brought the entire episode to an end and began a new one . It would not do to barrel on into Tushan this way , with the men still nervous on the trigger , to arrive in a crowded town full of fretting , turbulent people after dark . If they had arrived in Hochih yesterday , by day , and seen what they had seen on the morning 's walk to headquarters , he would have handled it better . he had handled it badly and his daydreaming embroidered what he had done : Philip-Baldwin-foul-up ; no , more simply , PhilipBaldwin-fool . He did not know whether he had to do Tushan tomorrow , or could do Tushan tomorrow , but he did not want to face that decision today . He could not . Through Su-Piao , he turned and consulted Kwan . Kwan 's voice was clipped , unmoved , expressionless . He agreed . It would be better to come into Tushan by daylight and find the headquarters , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could make plans . Better to sleep alone on the open road , Baldwin said , if they could find a roof and walls to shelter them in the fields , than to lock themselves into a village inn , or any town swarming with refugees . But where to find a roof and walls that had not been torn down for wood to warm the wanderers , and his eyes scanned the fields as they drove . It was Kwan who first saw it , his eyes sweeping the landscape with the skill of an old campaigner . On a crest , on a gentle rise , still miles away in the gray , it stood square and squat , like the rectangular locked-masonry of a Norman keep . " Maybe there , " said Kwan , " maybe it is empty . " " What is it ? " said Baldwin as they drew nearer . " A blockhouse , " Su-Piao translated and then added , dully , on her own , " I 've seen dozens of them . " " Blockhouse ? " asked Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all over China . ' We  | built them when we were fighting the Communists . The Generalissimo drove the Communists out of South China that way . He used to build circles of blockhouses about their areas and then squeeze them out . Sometimes , the warlords built them , too . But this is probably an old blockhouse of ours ? The Communists had to march across these hills when they were escaping from the Generalissimo . That was before they turned north , on their Long March . That was ten years ago . The Generalissimo left these blockhouses all across their trail wherever they moved in China . If only this one 's empty . " It was empty . On the aching surface of the day 's events , luck had placed an empty blockhouse in which they could sleep . Its gates were splintered and open , its interior cold and moist , but it was empty ; and in the square courtyard of its thick walls , the jeep and three trucks could stop and be guarded . On the stone flooring they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebbles and gravel , heaped them in a basin , poured gasoline on it and a blue fire burned . They brought Lewis and stretched him on the ground beside the fire and after a while , Miller opened another can of pork-andgravy and they ate . But Collins lay in the truck in the cold outside and no one wanted to talk . Someone had brought the field-radio in and snapped it on , but nothing within its radius made any sound except the occasional da-dit , da-dit of some unknown Chinese sender and the surging roar of the static . Baldwin knew there was probably no American call-signal closer than a hundred miles , yet he leaned forward like the other men about the radio and watched Prince stroking the dials . Once a squawking , distorted Chinese voice balanced momentarily on the edge of a wave-length , above the hum of static , and Prince handed the earphones to Baldwin , who handed them to Kwan . But by the time Kwan had adjusted the phones , the voice had fallen off  | again into the wild emptiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , over and over again to the same point , the voice would not return . They were alone . Baldwin did not want to eat with the men ; they would have to talk and there was nothing to talk about except what had just happened . He did not want to join Su-Piao and Kwan , because the coldness that had settled on him when Collins died had made them Chinese again , and he wanted no Chinese courtesies . But he did not want to sit alone , apart , either , while everyone watched him , wondering what was on his mind . There was nothing on his mind , actually  --  no plans , no program , no will . He would go into Tushan in the morning . If the Chinese wanted him to blow Tushan , he would blow Tushan . If they did not , he would leave it . Let them decide . If they got up early , at six or seven , they would be in Tushan  --  when ? How many miles ? Kwan would know and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pork-and-gravy without conversation and without appetite . They had just passed a town called Nantan , Su-Piao translated for Kwan , and Nantan was about one hundred fifty li from Tushan , " mountain li . " " One hundred fifty li , " said Baldwin calculating three to a mile . " That 's about fifty miles , is n't it ? What does mountain li mean ? " " A li does n't really measure distances , " said Su-Piao , " it 's flexible . The li of an easy , flat road is longer than the li of a difficult mountain road . A short road over the hills has more li sometimes than a longer road over the paddies . It 's a way of thinking , really ; you ask a peasant how far it is to the next town and he tells you how many li but that 's not really the distance , that 's how long it takes to get there . " Baldwin was irritated . That was China , always uncertain .  | Everything sounded sensible , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his question . He said nothing , and Su-Piao continued trying to open a little the bridge of friendship which he had closed . " If you have to cross a river by ferry on your trip , the ferry crossing is ten li all by itself . " " How ? " he asked in spite of his restraint . " If a road is only forty li between two towns and crosses a ferry on the way , that makes fifty li for the journey because it takes more time . " For a moment , Baldwin found himself toying with the odd logic of her statement , and felt a faint ripple of amusement inside himself . Then , he was angry with himself for being amused and at the feeling of friendship rising in him again . Collins had been killed . Chinese had killed him . These two had not yet acknowledged it . " And today , " he said , " how many li did we come today , how many li do you add when the road costs a man ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the responsibility to her because she was Chinese . She did not answer , retreating from him in her silence , then turned and translated what he had said to Kwan . " He was good , " said Kwan , " he was beginning to understand China . " " It did n't do any good , " said Baldwin bitterly . " You will take him back to Kwciyang and send him home ? " asked Kwan . " Yes , " said Baldwin . " It is good . He will sleep in the grave of his ancestors . Chinese soldiers are not sent home when they die . So their families eat great bitterness . " " Yes , " said Baldwin curtly . He did not want Kwan to  | equate the death of an American with the ragged soldiers dying here in the hills . " The soldiers who die here , " said Kwan , " will die without any coffin . They will die without even the straw a poor peasant has at home to wrap him . They will die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their clothes and then the dogs will eat them . " Baldwin stood hard and unyielding before them , still trying to make them , the Chinese , share the blame . " I 'll have to write his father that he died , " he said . Neither Kwan nor Su-Piao answered . Baldwin continued . " Usually you never tell them how their sons died . The Army does n't think parents should be told , it makes them imagine things . You say he was killed in action , that his loss came as a great shock , that he will be mourned and missed by all the men in his outfit . But this will be more difficult . His mother is dead , he told me . And it 's always more difficult to write the father . And his father is a judge . And he 'll write and ask exactly what happened . " They were still silent . Kwan had retreated now into the Chinese neutrality , his eyes bleak as if he were seeing nothing . Su-Piao sat with her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press on . " I 'll have to tell him how he was killed . Not in action . If Collins had been killed in action , fighting Japanese , his father would think he was a hero , and being the father of a hero helps . But now , somehow , his death will seem meaningless , and this will be a private sadness for his father . His father will hate the Chinese , and hate and hate them , until he 's dead . He wo n't understand . " Still looking at the ground , as if she were speaking to herself , Su-Piao said :  | " No one will understand . No one except Chinese . You ca n't explain it to Americans . " Baldwin did not know whether she included him , too . " Explain what ? " " It takes too long to say . " He could not invite her to talk , the coldness was still in him , he did not want to recognize that somewhere in the past two days the distance between them had powerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying nothing , hoping the pause in the conversation and his silence would force her on . Her day , too , had been full of terrors and she , too , had to unwind . " It 's all falling apart , " she said after a while , slowly , speaking almost as much to herself as to Baldwin . " Nobody sees it , not the Chinese , not the Americans . But I can see it . I 'm both . I 'm Chinese . And I 'm American , too ; I feel that way . I can see it now from the very beginning . From when I was a little girl . " Unwillingly , he had been caught to attention . Baldwin had never thought of Chinese as children , except for the urchins on the road , with their scabrous heads , their bright black eyes , their restless playing and chattering , like puppies . All Chinese were grownups when he thought of them . But Su-Piao must have been a little girl once . He listened . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she began falteringly , as Baldwin wondered what this had to do with Collins and it all falling apart , " I was ten years old and father always took me back in the springtime to the family land in Anhui , in a town called IIofei , where the family had come from . He took me back for the spring festival every year because it was so beautiful . In Shanghai , at the apartment , he used to laugh at the old ways and say they were primitive  | superstitions  --  but he loved them . I did , too , they were so beautiful . The torches of pine for the festival that could only be kindled by the light of the sun reflecting on those centuriesold bronze mirrors . We used to polish the mirrors in Hofei with cornsilk , until they were like glass . Then , when it began , the drums would beat , and the procession would start from our house with paper buffaloes , and the dancing , and the flutes  --  and the sky in Anhui is so pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival before the plowing , with foods of honey that people never ate except only then . " My mother would never go . She was real Shanghai , she 'd been born there and she never left except to go to Hong Kong , or the beach , or to visit America  --  her family taught her to play piano when she was a girl , and she spoke English , and she wanted me to play tennis and ride horseback . But she 'd let me go to Anhui , because she knew papa really loved going back once a year , even though he was a modern , and made believe he laughed at all of it . " I think it was 1925 , this time . The warlords were always fighting in Anhui when I was a little girl , they 'd been fighting there even before I was born . I must have been ten years old at the time . " Baldwin did the arithmetic quickly in his mind . She could not yet be thirty if she had been ten in 1925 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a general 's wife , but she was talking about a little girl ; her voice had lost the quality of talking-to-herself and had acquired a quality of intimacy , talking to him urgently , not rapidly but with the excitement of explanation and unburdening . " We stayed in Hofei for four days that year . Papa always did all the year 's business at the spring festival too , looking over the land accounts , trying to tell his brothers and the rest  | of the family about the new seeds the Americans had developed and that our land should be planting , talking with them about the peasants ' rents . " Then one day he took me into town with him , he had business to do at the Guildhall . When he was in Anhui he used to wear the long silk robe , a black one like everyone else who was a gentleman , not the Western business suit he wore in Shanghai . He loved it really . Well , that day ... " She broke off suddenly and looked at Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask if she were saying too much of herself , but his attention reassured her and she began again in the same tone . " That day . . . oh yes , I should have said the family had told him not to go into town because there had just been one of those spring wars between the warlords . I think it was Chang Tso-lin whose troops had come down from the north and had fought some battles with the southern warlords , and now his troops were going back north , retreating so it was best to stay indoors at home because retreating soldiers always did their plundering on the way back . " But papa had just come up from Shanghai . He thought that warlords were comic , just the way the Americans did . " She smiled as a memory crossed . " I suppose they were , the soldiers carrying their umbrellas and their suitcases along with their rifles and some had birdcages with them for their canaries , and the warlords took their concubines with them . Papa thought they were funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we were eating in the restaurant outside the northern gate , the Pei-Men Ta-Tien , after he had finished his business . Just papa and me . He was so happy to have me with him and his family in Hofei again , and the lao-pan , the restaurant-owner , who knew our family , made such a fuss over me  --  he gave me a whole plate of  | pastries of honey and nuts to nibble on myself . I was the little Shang-hai hsiao-chieh . ' " Then the soldiers came in . The restaurant owner and all the waiters left papa and me right away and began to serve the soldiers . The soldiers were already drunk . Papa began to hurry me to finish . Everybody else in the restaurant began to call for their bill , too . Then , suddenly , a big husky soldier , so tall he must have been from Shantung , took out his rifle and slammed the butt down on his table so hard that the dishes broke . And he got up , drunk , and yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quiet . They were all afraid . Papa , too . And the big soldier yelled that the rich people did not like the soldiers who fought for them , that he knew they thought soldiers stank , that it was true soldiers did not smell good , but that was because soldiers had to sleep on the ground , or in the stables with the animals . Then he said that nobody should leave the restaurant until the soldiers had finished eating , that they should give honor to the soldiers . " Then he saw me . I had on a yellow dress , all the little girls got new dresses at the spring festival because it was the beginning of the new year . Nobody in Hofei would have taken a ten-year-old girl in her new dress to a public restaurant , but papa was from Shanghai and so full of American ideas . We must have looked so strange and conspicuous there , me in my yellow dress , he in his black silk robe . " The big soldier came over to us and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at papa when the soldier did that , and papa was frozen with fear . The big soldier smelled of onions , and his breath had alcohol on it . His face was so red . He stroked my head and his hands were rough , but he was n't trying to hurt me . He was telling papa that little children should be taught to respect soldiers because the sol-  | diers were China 's only hope . Then he noticed papa 's wrist watch and he belched over me and asked papa if he could look at the wrist watch . Papa took if off and said to the soldier that he should keep it , because the soldiers were fighting for China . " It made the soldier furious . He yelled that soldiers were n't bandits . He was going to buy the watch from papa . Papa said he did n't want any money . And the soldier yelled some more and gave papa a handful of dirty paper bills , and went off with the watch . Then they upset their own table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money was paper money , of course . Either from some bank they had looted , or paper their warlord had printed up . It was just paper , worthless . Papa left it there . The restaurant owner came over and apologized for what had happened . But papa went home . The next day we got on the train back to Shanghai , and I think papa never went back to Hofei . " But I 'll never forget sitting there , with the soldier 's hand on my head and papa being afraid , saying nothing . Papa being afraid ! He could n't take care of me . He could n't take care of himself . Nobody could take care of us . He was only safe in Shanghai because the foreigners governed Shanghai , with their police . Mama scolded him when he came back . Of course , Mama hated being Chinese . " Baldwin found that he was sitting on the floor beside her , on her bedroll , listening to a story about a ten-year-old . He wondered how many times she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told it . Ile knew he could not stop her now from telling more , and he did not want to stop her . He had forgotten about Collins , without realizing it , and knew the woman was making a point , as women always do , in the long roundabout way the emotions take to illuminate and justify what they want to say . He was listening to her now with only half-attention , aware  | of what she was saying , interested , yet paralleling the story with memories of his own , from his own childhood . She told him how she had dreamed she was American , and went to the American School in Shanghai , and had gone to Boston to Radcliffe as her mother had gone to Radcliffe and come home and found China had begun to change . There was a government now , she said , a real government , and its soldiers were not bandits , and the officers were educated , and there were universities , doctors , factories , engineers . Except that she had gone north to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it was when she was a little girl . She had been walking in the street and had seen two Koreans carrying away a screaming little girl , and a father and mother crying after the Koreans . But they were Korean ronin , gunmen protected by the Japanese army , which already controlled the north . They were moneylenders , who had lent money to the parents , and since the parents could not pay they were seizing the little girl to take away for payment . And Su-Piao had run to the Chinese policemen to ask them to come quickly to help ; but the policemen had shrugged their shoulders because the ronin were under the protection of the Japanese army . There was the hospital she had seen in Tientsin too , the hospital for people dying of opium which the Koreans were peddling for the Japanese army . The students in the schools were organizing a boycott of the Japanese in Tientsin but nobody could stop the Koreans from selling the drugs because the Japanese army was everywhere in North China , and it controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of the people either , there was no protection and she had come back to Shanghai , hating the Japanese . It occurred to him , with the other half of his mind , as she was talking , that all these things must have been happening -  | when he was a boy , too , but he had not felt them , not even the depression although he could remember his father , so sure of himself , talking about that-fool-Hoover , that-scoundrelRoosevelt . Father disapproved of everything that happened in Washington ; father had never been a success ; but he had been proud and never been afraid of anything . Nor was Helen , he suddenly realized . ITelen was strong , he realized , as he listened to this Chinese woman talk . She carried herself with strength ; Helen would have made the policemen help the child . Helen would risk far more than himself , and it was he who always saw what would happen if things went wrong . Until today , when he had risked it without thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Su-Piao talk , thinking about Collins and about Helen and was Helen stronger than he , and why had she wanted to marry him . But Su-Piao had been talking , and there had been a pause , and Su-Piao had begun again exactly as if their thoughts were meshing . " I suppose I married him , " she was saying with great earnestness  --  and Baldwin scrambled to pull back out of his mind what she had been saying when he had begun to wander , and remembered it was about the Japanese attacking at Shanghai seven years ago , in 1937 , and how wonderful it was when China , finally , turned and fought . It was there she had met her husband , ' 1 " unh ling , who was a young colonel , an officer of the artillery , fighting , and had married him . He was fully alert now , listening . " I suppose I married hint , " she said , " because he was n't afraid of anything . He wanted to be proud . Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those first few months , that we could take care of ourselves , we had the new army , and the new officers , and the new arsenals , and everyone helped . " But then we were pushed back inland , and as we went  | back and back and the war went on , I realized what we were . We were a crust , a brittle thin crust beginning to form over the wounds . It had taken all those years since I was a little girl to build up this crust of new people over the warlords , and I thought the Generalissimo had made this crust , that it was his , that he was taking care of us . But it was n't . He was part of the crust , he did n't make it . It belonged to him because he wanted to make China strong , but the Japanese saw it better . If they could break the crust , if they could take Shanghai and Nanking and Canton , the cities on the coast where there was just beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing could ever be built again . I hate the Japanese , they did it , they did everything . Once the crust is gone , everything 's gone . " Baldwin could see what she meant . He had never thought of himself as part of a crust in America , but of course he was . Only it was such a thick crust , it went all the way down to the bottom . He was sure that Lowry &; Moody could get half a dozen engineers to do his job as well , that the army could fill his spot with twenty men just as good just by shuffling punchcards through a machine . But he could see that an engineer , or a good officer , or a good doctor , or a good anything in China would be much more important , in a much thinner crust . Yet you could not wipe out what people knew , they were still there . Musing , he interjected : " But they 're still there , are n't they ? They have n't all been wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said sharply , and Baldwin could see by the tone in her voice that she had been making a point . " That 's what I 'm trying to say . You do n't understand that this is the end of it , here , now , on this road . Some Chinese stayed behind in Canton and Shanghai , and they 're  | working for the Japanese . Even if we go back , it 'll never be the same  --  those people will serve the Japanese as long as they stay , and they 'll serve us if we get back , or they 'll serve the Communists if the Communists come down from the north first . And the people who went to Chungking , with the Generalissimo  --  the war 's been going on too long , they do n't care any more , they 're just waiting for the war to be over . Even T'ung-ling hated the people in Chungking at the end , everyone at the front hates the people in Chungking , they 're safe . But these , these people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? These were the best . These are the people who would n't go north with the Communists , these are the people who did n't stay with the Japanese , they did n't even want to go on to Chungking and be safe with the Generalissimo . These are the good people from Shanghai , or Hankow , or Nanking , or Canton  --  not peasants . These are the people from the cities where we had the little crust , who came to East China or South China four or five years ago to settle down and start over again to help the war . They were the best , and this is the end of them , the end of everything . " It 's the end because there 's nobody to take care of these people . There has to be something to take care of people . People have to be protected . There has to be an order somewhere . And there is n't any order left anywhere in China . The Americans take care of the Generalissimo and he 's safe in Chungking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a warlord the Americans happen to be taking care of . He ca n't take care of us , he is n't taking care of us . Do you think if any of these people get to Kwciyang or Kunming safely , that they 'll be the same ? Do you think they 'd be the same if this happened in Boston and Americans had to walk out in the snow ? " " No , " said Baldwin , " no , they could n't be the same . "  | " They 're going to die , " she said , staring , her tone suddenly a resonant , carrying whisper as if she were talking of ghosts that only she could see . " Everybody back there in Hochih is going to die . Not everybody , maybe , but most of them . If any of them are going to live , it will be by accident . And life should n't be by accident . Death should n't be an accident . Dying should n't be something you can avoid only by trickery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means something , or because someone has come to the end of his days . There has to be something that takes care of people , a law , or a government  --  even here on this road , there should be a government . Any kind of government , even a government with a bad meaning , is better than no government at all . Because then people are animals . " Do you know how many millions of people in China have walked for their lives in the past seven years ? And only the cruel ones or the sly ones got out . All the good ones are used up  --  or their goodness has been used up . The peasants , oh , the peasants will always be the same , they 're hard and they 're bitter and they hate us and the Japanese both . But they stay . They 'll accept any government so long as it 's a government , and it can make some order in the land , or stop the war and let them work in the fields . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't people any more , we 're like what you saw this morning , now . We 're worse than the peasants , because we were educated ; we need to have a government to protect us , and there 's nothing left for us any more . We need a government so we can do something with it , or be kind , or have mercy . When there 's no government , there 's no mercy , it 's only savage . " The team , which had finished its food , had stopped talking to listen to her voice . Baldwin could see that she was crying , without stopping the out-rush of her words , and the words  | were hurting her , while the tears slowly washed down her cheeks . He wanted to hush her but he could not . " It 's all coming apart , " she said . " It 's like an avalanche , only the very strong or the very cruel will live , along with the dirty people who stayed on the coast with the Japanese . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even human any more , everyone dies by accident , without it meaning anything . Do n't you understand ? That 's what happened to Collins , he was caught when the avalanche fell on him , he was trying to be kind , but it fell on him just the same ; there 's no time to be kind any more , it 's too late , it 's too late . It 's all ending . You Americans can still get out  --  so get out , get out . You ca n't take care of us , so you 've got no business here . Do n't you see , do n't you see ? " She stopped again . She was no longer crying . The entire dark room was silent , the Americans waiting for her to go on : Kwan , not understanding her English , only her tone , frowning ; Baldwin tormented , feeling he understood , yet did not , not knowing what to say . Shc had almost finished . Softly this time , she said almost to herself : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radcliffe , I used to dream I was an American . In America , it 's so easy to dream . But I 'm Chinese , I 'm a real Chinese . When T'ung-ling died , I understood . But when Collins died , I did n't know what to think . When an American dies , it should mean something . " There was a long silence now and they were all uncomfortable . Miller broke it . " There 's more coffee , lady , do you want it ? " She shook her head , voice steady , tears gone . " How is Lewis ? " she asked . " He 's sleeping , " someone said .  | She rose from the ground and went over to where Lewis half-snored , half-whistled in his sleep . She knelt beside him and felt his forehead . " He 's burning , " she said as the sleeping man turned his head at her touch . All of them around the fire watched her , the gasoline flame lighting her face from underneath , the smooth planes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek bones , the broad , yet delicate , Chinese nostrils curling flat like an infant 's , the smooth-oiled hair coiled tight around the nape of her sun-browned neck , to where , Baldwin knew , it disappeared in the pale skin of the body . My God she 's beautiful , thought Baldwin , and they 've beaten her , and she 's only twenty-nine . He wanted to sit closer to her , to comfort her , perhaps to take care of her . He would get her to Kweiyang safely , he would get all of them to Kweiyang safely . But he had not taken care of Collins , and the thought brought back all the weight and force of what she said . He had lost Collins to save what ? He had thought he could save China and she had said it could not be saved . What was he trying to do ? He shook his head again trying to be clear in mind for he knew that somewhere in the course of the day he had lost not only Collins but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the team up the road . And if he did not know , what could he do tomorrow ? He was confused as she was , he told himself . Except that I have to decide again tomorrow , and I have to decide for all of us , and for Kunming , and for her . He heard her say , by his side : " I think I 'll try to sleep now . " " Yes , you 'd better , " he said . And then , " Good night , SuPiao . " His tongue had formed the words of her name haltingly , stumbling , but he felt better for having said it . He tried to take his eyes from her as she walked away to where her  | Chinese quilt lay rolled , as her woman 's figure stooped to untie it , as her legs tucked under her knees when she sat , then unfolded as she lay down beneath the quilt , and turned her back to the room . Somehow , she had relieved him of the guilt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the boy again with warmth and affection . But look at it how he would , it had been a bad day . And he could not see what he would do tomorrow . Except that he would put the team on the road early .  | CHAPTER V Decision by Default MICHAELSON was up first the next mor and grunted with satisfaction when he saw that in the r the skies had cleared . Today they could roll right throu they wanted to . If Baldwin wanted to . He wished Baldwin would get up . He needed five min with Baldwin before the men were at him , nagging , to out what was going to happen today . McNeil had al ' given him those five minutes at morning coffee and he been able to lay it out to the men after that . But now what the hell was he going to say . That he did n't know the score was ? Were they going to take the team Tushan , and take another chance of getting jumped like terday ? Or break their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidehill blow ? Or just barrel on through ? D it , it was a Chinese job , why in hell did n't the Chinese  | care of it themselves ? Did Baldwin know what the score was ? Angrily , Michaelson stamped on the ground to jar his freezing toes and began to flail his arms about his chest , warming up ; and then when Prince 's voice spoke up he was annoyed because he knew he looked stupid . There were two of them , Prince and Niergaard , up early too , and Prince was asking : " You know what the score is for today , Mike ? " " Not yet , " growled Michaelson . " Do you think he knows what the score is ? " continued Prince , sarcastically , but seriously . " What do you want , a blueprint ? " answered Michaelson dodging . " Yeah , " said Prince . " As a matter of fact , a blueprint would help . Even money , this joker does n't know what he 's going to do today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel when he 's betting his own chips . But I 'm one of the chips . We lost Collins yesterday . What 's the pitch ? When are we getting into Kweiyang ? " Michaelson 's thinking churned . They had a right to know . But he had a right to know first . Then Niergaard spoke , slowly , as always . " Look , Prince , let me say it . It 's this way , Mike , we 've been talking it over , we are n't pushing you , but you 're the only one who can talk to him . Why are we doing it ? I ca n't understand it  --  these people are dangerous and we 've done our job . The longer we fiddle around with them  --  well , the way I see it , we have our finger in a buzz saw , we ought to go right in  --  I mean , if we have to blow up these dumps they 're talking about , if we have to , well you know us  --  Mike , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do we go in today or do n't we , yesterday we did n't do a goddam thing and we got cut up . You see , Mike ? "  | Michaelson saw perfectly and , because he saw , he was furious , and because it was Niergaard , the farmer , whom he liked , he could explode without slugging him as he might have slugged Prince . " Jesus Christ ! " he yelled . " What the hell do you want ? You know how to read and write  --  write a letter to your Congressman ! Save it up until you get to Kunming and tell it to the chaplain ! This is the frigging army and you volunteered for this detail ! I 'll let you know as soon as I know anything myself . " He throttled down the burst of temper and knew he would have to speak to Baldwin , and snapped , " Let 's get the trucks turning . Warm them up . We 're going to roll early today . " And went to find Baldwin , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , and watched Baldwin shave , and knew by the slow deliberate movement of the man he watched that it was difficult to interrupt his thinking . But he caught Baldwin finally when Baldwin began slowly to drink his coffee from the canteen cup . Michaelson squatted , cleared his throat and said casu-ally : " What 's for today , Major ? " Baldwin did not say anything , and Michaelson said again : " I mean what shall I tell them , Major , are we going to do Tushan , or are we going on through ? " Baldwin turned slowly to look at him , blankly , his eyes still sleep-fuzzed and said : " How soon will we be ready ? " " Any time , Major ; about ten minutes , I guess . But they 're bushed , Major , they 've had it . And this thing yesterday shook them . " Michaelson could see Baldwin coming awake now and Baldwin said : " It 's about a hundred miles , is n't it ? "  | " To Kweiyang , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something like that . " " We could make it by noon , " said Baldwin , distantly , " if the roads were clear . " " By two o'clock anyway , " said Michaelson , his spirits rising . " We barrel right on through then ? Do n't stop for anything ? That 's it then ? " and he edged away , half-rising . It had been easy ; he had thought Baldwin was going to chew him out the way he had yesterday at Hochih . But Michaelson had moved too quickly . " No , " said Baldwin quietly . " No , you do n't get me . We have to stop in at Tushan , just for a look at the dumps , whether we do anything or not . " " Why ? " snarled Michaelson . " It 's dangerous . " " We 've paid for the look , " said Baldwin , as if to himself , " so we have to look . Whether we do anything or not . " Michaelson was baffled , then angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flat , puzzling statement , Michaelson could sense a reasoning . But he could not see it , and he felt like a fool , having to go out and hammer it into the men , when he did not see it . " I do n't get you , Major , " he said stubbornly . " If we do n't go in and look around today then we should have gone on through yesterday , " said Baldwin , more firmly , as if it were all quite clear . " I 'm not following you , " said Michaelson , not yielding at all . " Look , " said Baldwin , straightening , his voice suddenly clear and firm . " We paid the price to find out what 's happening yesterday , with Collins . It 's up to the Chinese headquarters here whether they want these dumps blown . But it 's up to us to check in on them and let them decide whether it 's their job or ours . "  | Michaelson was about to open his mouth , to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words hammered at him , fast , snapping : " Get the trucks loaded . Fast . Let 's get on the road . Let 's move . " In a few minutes they were on the way in traffic again , and Michaelson had dodged answering any questions from the men . The road , he saw , was good today . The fog , the clouds , the snow of the past two days had evaporated and the sky was polished . The frost on the stubble in the fields below sparkled like a carpet of crystals in the brilliance of the morning sun , and along the road they traveled they could see the telephone wires bowed and snapped by the weight of the rime that sheathed the wires in an inch-thick sleeve of ice . The little bed of narrow-gauge rail that had meandered on their route parallel to the highway , now in sight , now out of sight , was finally converging with them on a city , which must be Tushan , and Michaelson still did not know what Baldwin planned to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , stopped the convoy and Baldwin got out of the jeep to speak to them . " All you 've got to do , " said Baldwin as he assembled them , " for the next hour , all of you , is just sit . I 'm going back to town to find Chinese headquarters and find out what they propose to do about the big dumps here . I 'll be back in an hour or two at most . Do n't break out any food . Do n't make friends with anybody . If you 're hungry , use K-rations . Eat inside the cabs . When you 're not eating , I want you outside sitting on the trucks . I want them to see you 've got guns . But if anybody fires a shot except to save his neck , so help me God , I 'll break him and throw the book at him when we get into Kunming . Got that ? " They nodded . Prince began , " Say , Major ... "  | But Michaelson snorted at Prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeep , with the two Chinese , on his way to town when Prince turned to Michaelson again . " Listen , Mike , what the hell 's going on here ? " he asked . " He says he 's already put in his ante ; he 's paid for the next card . He wants to stay one more round because he 's already paid to look . " " So now he 's playing poker , " snapped Prince . " You heard it , " said Michaelson . " What the hell do you want me to do ? " As Baldwin maneuvered the jeep back through the crowded town , he knew he could not explain to Kwan and Su-Piao , whom he needed for this conference , why he wanted the conference any better than he could explain to Michaelson . It made no difference , he told himself , what the final Chinese decision was about the dumps . One way or another , it was up to them . But the dumps should not lie undecided before the Japanese , an accident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call was to establish responsibility for the decision somewhere , anywhere . This was why he had wasted a day ; and lost Collins ; and unless he carried on through now , to this last rendezvous with the Chinese , however perfunctory , then all of yesterday 's events made no sense . He had risen this morning , determined to go right on through to Kweiyang with Lewis , until Michaelson had spoken to him . But when he had answered Michaelson this morning , there had been this conviction waiting there on his tongue , the residue of the night 's sleep and the night 's unconscious thinking , already shaped . He had paid the price to force this decision , he must follow through . He wondered what kind of headquarters this would be . The town , he noted , was even more crowded than Hochih ,  | and he was glad he had posted the convoy on the far edge of town outside the crowd . But the drab grays , browns , blacks , blues of the refugee mass were flecked more persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little town rang with the clanging and cursing of military congestion  --  a soldier pulling at the bridle of two mules that drew a pack-howitzer , soldiers sleeping on trucks piled with ammo cases , soldiers in knots , waiting , leaning against walls , soldiers about a bonfire as the breath of their nostrils steamed in the cold . And he saw an officer beating a soldier with a stick , and though the soldier yelled , he was not being hurt . Baldwin recognized that there was a thin mantle of discipline in this town and he must locate the center , which was Kwan 's job . And after some questioning , Kwan guided him to a stop , before an arcade of boarded-up shop windows , which was the headquarters . A conference was going on at headquarters , an orderly told them , once the sentries had passed them . But , as if they had been expected , Baldwin , accompanied by Su-Piao and Kwan , were admitted in a matter of minutes . In the large , conspicuously clean room , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open grate with an old stovepipe carrying off its smoke and making the draft . It was cozy . The wall was covered with a large American detail map , its arrows in blue and red , its circles , boxes , and designations instantly illuminating the darkness of ignorance in which Baldwin had lived for four days . The red arrow north of the road was sweeping far wider than Baldwin had imagined , and the fat red box marked with the double cross indicated a full Japanese division , the Thirteenth . Along the road they had traveled for the past four days swept another arrow , and its designation marked it as the Japanese Third Division  --  still somewhere short of Hochih . Did the break in the arrow indicate  | the Japanese had stopped , there , where he thought his sidehill blow might have been ? Or did it mean that no one really knew where they were ? All this Baldwin noticed at a glance , as he heard Kwan talking to the men about the big table . It was a staccato conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tuned to the music of the language , could tell that these courtesies were flat and perfunctory . That was all right . It was just the way he felt , too . Su-Piao spoke to him first . " They 're asking about me ; I think they do n't like having a woman here . Kwan says I 'm the interpreter but they still do n't like it . Please say something to me in English so I can translate quickly , before they ask more about me . Kwan 's told them my name but not about my husband , or who he was , and they may learn , and that could be bad . " He had forgotten that her husband had been Central and that he had been executed . She had not mentioned the execution again since the first day . And all China seethed with spies , Japanese against Chinese , Chinese against Chinese , provincials against Central . ' Phis was a Central headquarters and it might , indeed , be bad if he appeared with the woman of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said loudly , " I am Major Baldwin of the American engineers . " His loud voice cut across the Chinese courtesies and abruptly he was in the conversation . They turned to him as Su-Piao translated , and , quickly , she continued to Baldwin . " Say something else , they 're waiting . " Baldwin reached into his pocket , pulled out the old faded Chinese pass McNeil had given him , laid it on the table with the red seal face up .  | " We are on our way from Liuchow to Kweiyang . My team is a demolition team and we 've been ordered to destroy as much as possible in the path of the Japanese advance . Find out what command this is , and whether they want us to stay today and work on these dumps . Make it sound courteous . " Su-Piao translated , Kwan breaking in now and then , obviously telling them by what route , and how they had come to Tushan . While Kwan talked , Baldwin studied them , and found himself impressed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the presence , wore three bronze triangular pips on his throat collar which made him a lieutenant-general , and Baldwin remembered the rule of thumb that all Chinese officers were graded two ranks above equivalent American rank , so this was probably a brigadier in authority . His head was shaven absolutely skin-smooth and it shone . The young one with the thick , full glossy head of hair and the sharp , intelligent face was probably his aide . A stocky , hard-faced man beside them wore two triangular pips . Then there was an old bespectacled one-pip , wearing ancient gold-rimmed spectacles all askew on his nose ; and , finally , the nervous one , chainsmoking his cigarettes . But they looked as if they could run an army , Baldwin admitted to himself . This was like a Chinese headquarters back in Kunming where he dealt with Central officers on engineering problems ; it clicked . They could handle it themselves ; it was all right . This will be over in ten minutes , he told himself , and we 'll be on our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would urge nothing ; and he would get out . The tall one in command had reached across the table to take the Chinese pass and was examining it . Then he handed it to the bespectacled officer and no one said anything . The  | tall one spoke to the old one and all of them conferred . Then the tall one in command spoke again , not unfriendly , but with no trace of courtesy in his voice . " He says this pass carries the seal of Chang Fa-Kuei . Chang Fa-Kuei commands only the war zone in Kwangsi . Now we are in another war zone , " translated Su-Piao . The tall one turned to the wall map , ran his finger down a heavy line that wove its way between Tushan and Hochih on the map . " Chang Fa-Kuei 's command runs only to the border of Kwangsi . Hochih is on the border of the two provinces ? Kwangsi and Kweichou . Tushan , where we are now , is in Kweichou . It is not part of Chang Fa-Kuei 's command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Baldwin . " It means , I suppose , that you have no authority to operate in this area . " Cheerfulness and regret suddenly mingled in Baldwin . I 've done it , he thought . I 've pushed it all the way , all I was supposed to do , and now they 've taken my responsibility away . Now I 've only my own men to think about . The thought crossed his mind that if he could exit now , courteously , while it was still only nine in the morning , why , the whole convoy would be in Kweiyang tonight ; they could have hot baths and sleep under a roof . Tomorrow , if there was a plane , he could be in Kunming and pick up the mail from home . The thought of mail brought Collins back to his mind . It would have been easier to explain Collins to himself and to everyone else if only they could blow the dumps here . It would be worth doing . He had paid for that , too . He wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , not his . " Fine , " Baldwin said , showing he understood by standing up , ready to go .  | " Ch'ing tso , " said the tall one . " Please sit down , he says , " translated Su-Piao . This was a switch . Now what , thought Baldwin , as the aide drew three big , straight-backed chairs about the table to replace the bench on which they had sat . Everyone sat down . These were ceremonial chairs , so high that Baldwin , tall as he was , could scarcely touch the ground . He was sitting on a throne . Su-Piao 's and Kwan 's legs dangled . " Ch'ing ho-ch'a , " said the tall one , and Su-Piao translated , " Will you have some tea ? " " Thank the general , " said Baldwin , " but tell him the men are waiting . If I ca n't help him , I should go back to them and we 'll go on to Kweiyang today . " The general turned to Kwan and said something and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general 's voice . Baldwin turned to Su-Piao for the translation but she held up her hand to silence him , waiting for Kwan to repeat the same phrases . " He was talking to Kwan , not me , " she said to Baldwin . " I 'm the interpreter and I know he still does n't like the idea of my being here . They have n't given me any tea . I think you should be careful now , I ca n't tell what is going on but he says , The honorable American officer must be tired , he must have some tea , then will you please sit with them in this meeting and give them of your honorable instruction . ' It 's very flowery , not the way he was speaking before . " " Instruction ? " " That 's a courtesy phrase , " said Su-Piao , " it means that they invite you to offer them ideas . They want you to wait and listen to them . He must have changed his mind about you since he rejected your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do I say ? " asked Baldwin , thinking to himself that  | if this was another gasoline trade he was having none of it . If the Central Army was that way , too , the hell with it . " Oh you say something courteous , too , like This is too much honor . ' " " Say it . " " Chun-chang t'ai K'o-ch'i , " said Su-Piao to the general . " No , no , the American general is doing us too much honor , he is too courteous , " returned the tall commander . " Tell him I 'm a major , not a general . " " He knows it . " The general muttered something to his staff , and they nodded agreement . " He says he wants your meaning on the situation , I mean , your views on the situation , I 'm getting my languages mixed up , " said Su-Piao . It was difficult to associate her present composure with the last evening 's outburst , thought Baldwin as he realized how smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel poised . But , of course , he thought , she 's almost American ; and these people are the crust , her crust , that she was speaking of last night . " Tell him the situation looks bad to me . I came here to get his ideas , " replied Baldwin . They all leaned forward around the table , the commander spoke to his aide , and the young aide began in a high , rapid , barking voice to speak as if he were reciting a monologue . He would pause , Kwan would ask a question . It dawned on Baldwin that this Chinese command had a real briefing officer , just like an American command , and they were being briefed . As Kwan questioned , the Chinese at the table began to focus on Kwan rather than on Baldwin and the talk moved too fast for Su-Piao to keep up . Something was obviously under debate  --  not in argument ,  | or dispute , but there was a pro-and-con involved and Kwan , who had just come in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whisper to Su-Piao , seeking to catch up . " Whose vote is Kwan casting here ? " he asked . " Yours , " she said . " What am I supposed to be in favor of ? " he asked . " I do n't know yet . Neither does Kwan . He 's trying to find out what 's in back of their minds . " " Well , what are they saying ? " " They 're explaining yesterday 's field orders , from Kunming . The Chinese-American ground-command in Kunming , the YOKE forces I think you call them , has been given authority over this sector . They want to form a new line of resistance . There 's an American airlift going on and the Americans are flying in two Chinese divisions of the New Sixth Army from the Burma front . The Americans are landing the divisions in Kweiyang , and moving them by truck from Kweiyang down the road towards here . The line will be about thirty miles north of here , where the next big mountain rise is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's this headquarters supposed to do ? Why did they order the withdrawal from Hochih yesterday ? " Su-Piao held up her hand , restraining him . She was trying to listen to the conversation and translate at the same time and her sentences came in snatches of undertone . " The general here says it will take about a week to assemble those Burma divisions on the mountain line . It 's almost a mile high . Transport is short . The Americans control the Burma divisions  --  they equipped them with American arms . The Americans refuse to let those troops be fed down the road into the Japanese in pieces . So YOKE and Chinese field headquarters have jointly ordered a withdrawal of all Chinese troops up the road , to prepare the new line for the new divi-  | sions , and hold it until they 're dug in . Everything now on the road is supposed to start moving back as soon as possible without waiting for the Japanese to cut them off . " " I see , " said Baldwin , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head now , clearly , because somewhere far up the line someone else was thinking clearly , too ; there was American staff-work in this . They would yield the foothills to the Japanese all the way up to the main barrier before Kweiyang . That would leave a no man 's land between the Chinese and the Japanese until the new barrier was ready , in force and well supplied . " That 's clear , " said Baldwin , " very good , a pull-back . " " No , " said Su-Piao , " it 's not clear at all . There 's more coming . Be careful . " The officers around the table had paused . The chain-smoker lit a new cigarette . The old one drummed his fingers on the table . The stocky one had begun a knee jiggle . Obviously , they had come to a point of climax . The tall commander was clearing his throat . Now it was the commander himself doing the briefing , in a burst of exposition . He was explaining the Japanese situation : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but much cavalry , much infantry , and pack-borne mountain artillery . On the other hand , the Japs were still dressed in summer clothes and it was very , very cold . It would take at least four or five days of hard marching for the infantry , at least two days of hard riding by the cavalry for the Japanese even to approach Tushan . Therefore , there was no immediate danger , not today . Certainly , in a week , if the Japanese wanted to strike , there would be no way of stopping them . But there was no danger to Tushan from the Japanese at the moment . The only question was a question of time : if they did not start marching these  | troops here , now , to the new line , could they reach it in time when the Japanese came closer ? The general 's troops were tired . Many were sick . They must march in the snow . " There 's something in what he says , " said Baldwin to SuPiao in an undertone as she tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general spoke . Baldwin felt a sympathy for the Chinese general  --  he had a real problem . But it was his decision here ; Baldwin was just an observer and beginning to be interested in the way the Chinese fought a war . Still and all , though , they had orders to withdraw . Why did they wait ? " Yes , I ca n't quite see how the Japanese can get here quickly , " he said aloud , politely . Su-Piao translated the remark , and the Chinese officers all nodded gravely and the general said : " Yes . That is clear , too . That is the opinion of Chunling-pu . Chun-ling-pu does not think the Japanese will be here for several days . Chun-ling-pu says we should wait , " said the general , somberly . " Who 's Chun-ling-pu ? " asked Baldwin . " It 's not who , ' it 's what . Chun-ling-pu is Operations Division of the General Staff in Chungking . Chun-ling-pu 's orders usually come from the Generalissimo personally . " " I do n't get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kunming , the joint Chinese-American command , is supposed to be running the front now . That 's what he just said . They told him to pull out . But this order from Chungking says they ought to sit around and see what happens . There 's a direct conflict there . What 's happening ? Who 's boss ? " " Yes , " said Su-Piao , " oh yes , it 's happening all over again . " " What ? " said Baldwin . " Just a minute , " said Su-Piao . " I want to listen . " A cold silence had fallen over the Chinese staff at the table .  | The general rose and went to the wall map and pondered it as if somewhere in the ridge lines , the elevations , the greasecrayon overlays , there might be an answer . It looked exactly like a Western war-room , like an American war-room . But it was n't , Baldwin suddenly knew , it was different . Kwan joined the general at the map , the other officers followed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone . " They really are in trouble , " said Su-Piao . " If they fall back , they will disobey the Generalissimo . If they stay and get trapped , or do n't get to the new line fast enough and the Japanese come fast , the line up forward may go . Then they 'll be in trouble with the field command . " " This is a hell of a way to run an army , " offered Baldwin . " Do n't say that , " said Su-Piao sharply . " These are brave men . These arc Central troops . They are n't afraid to die , they 're just afraid of the Generalissimo . " These were her people , he realized , her vanishing home . Her husband had been a Central officer . She was still loyal . " It 's just that they do n't know what to do . The Generalissimo does n't trust them any more , he does n't trust anybody . And they do n't trust the Chun-ling-pu . There has to be a glue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make the army really an army again . The glue is gone . That 's how T'ung-ling got killed . Just like this . " " Your husband ? Like this ? " " At Changsha . When the Japanese attacked , our area command wanted to pull back and fight from the hills . But Chunfing-pu thought we ought to fight to hold the city . The Generalissimo is always stubborn , lie wants to hold everything . Then our staff divided . T'ung-ling commanded the corps artillery ; he thought the area command was right and took the artillery up into the hills overlooking the city . But the in-  | fantry commanders thought that Chun-ling-pu was right ; either that , or they were afraid of the Generalissimo . So they kept the infantry in the town . T'ung-ling wanted the infantry to dig in , in the hills , to protect the artillery , where we could support each other . The infantry command wanted the guns brought down to the city to support the infantry there . Our general could n't make up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took the artillery first because it had no infantry protection ; then they wiped out the infantry because it had no artillery support . Chungking was furious . The Generalissimo had the key officers executed . So T'ung-ling was shot . " " God ! " ejaculated Baldwin and thought , what a way to lose a good man . " These people are in trouble , " repeated Su-Piao again , and now they were coming back to their seats around the table and regarding Baldwin . He spoke : " Let 's stay out of this , " he said to Su-Piao . " Ask them what they plan to do about Tushan . Our orders are to coordinate demolition with the Chinese on the way . What about these ammunition dumps here ? Do they want them blown or not ? " Su-Piao translated . The Chinese general stared straight back at them unblinking , and said softly : " And what is the honorable opinion of the Americans ? What is your instruction ? " Over to me , said Baldwin to himself , jolted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switch . Let the American say . Let the American make the decision . They were handing it over to him . He had thought he did not care any longer . But , toying with his answer , he could not escape the fact that he did care .  | He had lost one man killed and another man sick . It would be all right to go on if only these people took responsibility for the dumps . Someone had to do it , and it was their job . But somehow it was his too , and he could not walk away from it . Grand strategy belonged to men back in Kunming , or Chungking , or Washington . But if here at the end of the war America was too busy to think about this front , or what might come after , or what it meant  --  he must . He was Philip Baldwin . He was line command now . This was what line command was . After all the palaver and discussion , and briefing  --  line command was to say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " or " do that . " Big or little , command was different from staff , or counsel , or consultation . This was a bigger thing , he knew , than he had ever done before , or would do again . He could not have done it last week . The reason why he was here lay buried somewhere in yesterday 's snow , and the snows of Boston , and doing things right because they were right . And he must . He lifted his cup of tea , sipped it , reflecting with half his mind that he was beginning to like tea and that he was beginning to understand China . As he sipped it , and they waited for his answer , he thought how easy it would be , if he wanted to , to say Thank you for the tea , and then Good-bye , and be off . But they wanted him to make them agree to blow the dumps , he could sense it . And so he would . " Tell them , " he said to Su-Piao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dumps . " He was speaking slowly , thinking Chinese as he spoke , letting her translate his phrases slowly , using the pauses to think , but knowing that none of the phrases that formed almost of themselves on his lips need be logical now that he had made the basic decision . " Tell them that no one can guess the Japanese intention .  | If the Japanese are only coming here on a raid patrol and then go back because it is too cold , they will certainly destroy the dumps while they are here . We can not save the dumps . But if the Japanese have planned a major drive , they will base here at Tushan and use the ammunition . Or maybe if they find the ammunition , they will change their minds and stay here . " He knew the logic was false , but he was amused to hear how plausible it sounded . Victory would come with the next year , he felt in his bones , and the Japanese command would not spend its last troops so far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very end . But he went on talking about the Japanese , as if it were he , alone , judging the enemy , shirking all mention of the conflict of orders in which this staff was trapped . " So it is wise , and best , to destroy the ammunition before the Japanese get here , because if it stays here it may make the Japanese come . Or if they come , it may make them stay . " Then , oddly enjoying himself , he finished , " . . . but I am only an American major who has come to help the Chinese . The general is older , he understands better , what does he want me to do ? " " You 're learning to speak Chinese , " said Su-Piao after she concluded the translation . But the general spoke better Chinese and was back at him , as all listened . " So the American general wants to explode the dumps . He has decided . " There was the responsibility back in his lap . " Tell him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment more he could force the general 's hand . " The American is very wise , " said the general . " He is right . "  | Baldwin had won on the blowing of the dumps . Therefore he knew the general would also withdraw now . So he had it made . But he wanted to see how far he could force it . He reached back into his pocket for the faded Chinese document with the faded seal of Chang Fa-Kuei . He felt like one of the partners at Lowry &; Moody , describing the clinching of a deal , when the papers are put on the table to sign . " If the general will put his seal on my pass , too , I will go to assemble my men . " The Chinese faces froze . Had he gone too far ? He knew that somehow for days he had meant to blow these dumps . But they were Chinese and this was so big , and it was their country . They should share the decision , once he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice was no longer clipped , short and military . It was young , conversational ? conspiratorial . " Kwan 's good , " said Su-Piao . " Listen . " " I am , " said Baldwin , " but my Chinese is n't that good . What 's he saying ? " " They 're talking it over now , seriously . It always comes down to this . Kwan says the general need n't issue any orders . He says you will assume full responsibility . The general 's seal will be under Chang Fa-Kuei 's seal , it puts him second in line of responsibility after Chang Fa-Kuei . It only gives you permission to do your duty as you pass through this command , that 's what Kwan is saying . " There was no change in the sad features of the general . With melancholy , he explained something to Kwan . " He says he ca n't . Chang Fa-Kuci is not his commander . Chang Fa-Kuei has no authority . Chang Fa-Kuci is not loyal to the Generalissimo . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Su-Piao . " It 's because he 's a Central man , he 's loyal . " " I can get him off that hook , " said Baldwin . He reached into his pocket , shuffled through the papers , drew out the blue top copy of the message that he had been carrying since the night at Liuchow . It was wrinkled and messy now , but the English print of the typewriter was clear and the red stamp of Signal Center reception , with date and time , that the Liuchow field reception had placed on it , looked official . " Tell him these are joint Chinese and American orders , " said Baldwin . Kwan had it clearly now , and his Chinese was rapid , almost jocular , easy , friendly . The general relaxed and examined the blue American message . " I think he 'll put his seal on it , " said Su-Piao . And as she spoke the general made a remark to his aide . The aide left to return in a moment with a pad of vermilion ink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , crystal cube , pressed it in the ink , then pressed it on the message . The seal , a delicate intertwining of lines , stood out on it . He looked up , a smile lit his face , and he handed the document back . " There is time , " said the general . " Will you stay and eat with us ? We have poor food , but we will be honored . " " No , " said Baldwin , smiling now , too . " We must go , we have work to do , and we want to be on the road again this afternoon . " He thought a moment , then added , " Ask him if he can give us a few of his own men to help on the job . We 'll need them if we have any trouble on the spot . " The general agreed  --  his soldiers would meet the Americans at the dump . Baldwin rose . Kwan and Su-Piao rose . Kwan bowed from the hips . Su-Piao bowed from the hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressionlessly turned to Su-Piao . " The general has asked Kwan if he would like to come back to this headquarters and remain when today 's work is done and you have gone , " she said . " What does Kwan say ? " " He did n't say . I 'm sure he does n't want to stay here . " Baldwin was happy . He wanted Kwan with him . He was taking care of Kwan as well as Su-Piao now . " Tell the general I should very much like to please him . But I have orders to keep Kwan with me until I get to Kunming , " lied Baldwin . Baldwin thrust out his hand and the general took it in a firm clasp . He murmured something and Baldwin asked : " What did he say ? " " He says he understands . He says also , China and America are friends , ' " translated Su-Piao , and the conference was over . It was not until they had left the conference that Kwan spoke to Baldwin . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gude . " " Gude ? " repeated Baldwin . " What does that mean ? " Su-Piao smiled . " IIe 's trying to speak English . He 's saying good , ' he 's happy you kept him with us . " It was remarkable how boyish and young Kwan 's voice had sounded in English . In English , thought Baldwin , all Chinese sound young . As Baldwin pushed the jeep back through the streets to the convoy , he realized that even carrying the ache of Collins and the exhaustion of the week , things were now flowing in him again , as if he had been re-wired . Now there was only  | the blow to organize , and that meant the men , and he realized how irritated he had been with Michaelson in the morning , when they woke . To do it well , though , he needed Michaelson with him ; command was not simply a thing of ordering people but of bringing them along to act with the same purpose . He noticed with satisfaction that the convoy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left it , the men sitting on top of the trucks , their guns easily handy , as he had ordered , and there had been no trouble . First Michaelson , Baldwin told himself ; and called him over , apart from the men . " We 've been handed the job , Mike , " he said . " They 're going to leave it to the Japs if we do n't do it . How about our men ? " " What about our men ? " asked Michaelson with an undertone of surliness . " You said they 're beat , " said Baldwin . " This morning . We 've pushed them hard . Have they got it in them for just one more ? " They were going to do it anyway , Baldwin knew , and he knew that Michaelson knew it , too , but he was appealing to Michaelson and wanted him to know it . " If they 've got to , they 've got to , " said Michaelson , feeling he was being mouse-trapped , yet wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could send Lewis on ahead , that would make everybody feel better . If we send Lewis on ahead , and I can lay it on the line to them that this is really the last one  --  well , you know , they 've never blown a whole ammunition dump before , and it 's still a damned good outfit , maybe we can wind them up . " Michaelson had ended in a tone of partnership , and Baldwin wanted to keep it that way . But he hesitated .  | Then he said : " If we send Lewis , that means sending another man to drive . " " Yes . Miller , " said Michaelson . " He 's a nice guy but a slob . He 'll be like a mother to Lewis on the road . And we put Collins on the same truck . They barrel right through , maybe they can get Lewis to a hospital tonight . " " Fine , " said Baldwin . " Let 's move . Maybe we can all be in tonight . Get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " yelled Michaelson , turning from Baldwin . And Baldwin knew Michaelson was with it , finally . " Listen , " said Baldwin when they were all assembled about the jeep , " we 're going to split up now . We have a day 's work here for some of us , but there 's no need of keeping Lewis on the road any longer . " They rustled , edging forward , because now at last they could see it ending , and somebody would , right now , be given clearance to speed a truck down the road , to Kweiyang , and get out of it all . " Miller , " said Baldwin , " you 're driving Lewis out . Take Ballo 's truck , with the rations . We 'll put Lewis in back and cover him up warm . We 'll put Collins on in back with you , too . I want Lewis in a hospital as fast as possible . There 's a YOKE force liaison somewhere in Kweiyang . They can get him to Kunming tomorrow morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or you may hit an American liaison group with these new Chinese divisions coming in . If you do , turn Lewis over . We 'll be in Kweiyang ourselves tomorrow morning . Afternoon at the latest . We 'll locate you through YOKE headquarters . Got it ? " " Got it , " said Miller . " When do I start ? " Baldwin looked at Miller 's round face trying not to show  | its happiness , acting tough and unconcerned like everyone else , and Miller was not making a good job of it . " Right now , " said Baldwin , " just as soon as we can move Collins and Lewis over to Ballo 's truck . Make sure you have enough gasoline and fill up some extra jerry-cans . The rest of of you , start turning the trucks around because we 're going back to the dumps . I 'll explain it when we get there . " Baldwin waited until Lewis had been transferred and then climbed up to look at him . Behind two cartons of food , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the men had fitted Lewis a cubbyhole of blankets and bedrolls where he lay , his face yellow and drawn , his eyes deep with purple edgings . " Lewis ? " asked Baldwin bending low . " All right ? " Lewis looked up at him , nodding , saying nothing . " You 're pulling out now , Lewis , " continued Baldwin . " Miller 's driving up front . You 'll be in Kweiyang tonight , in the Kunming hospital tomorrow morning . " From the cubbyhole in which he lay , Lewis murmured something . Baldwin bent to hear . " Is Collins going on this truck , too ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Baldwin , annoyed . " He 's in back . " " I do n't want to ride with a dead man , " said Lewis weakly . " Can I ride up front ? " " You ride back here , damn it , " snapped Baldwin , not knowing why his annoyance with this weakling was so great , why he should raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , realizing that the man was sick , he bent and stroked Lewis ' head . " I 'm sorry , " he said to the man 's face . " I 'm edgy . Lewis , you 're better off back here , out of the wind , lying down . Collins wo n't bother you . And Miller is up front . You like him you know . "  | Lewis ' head nodded in feeble assent and he closed his eyes . At the end of the truck , Baldwin saw as he straightened , the men were hoisting a flopping bedroll , bound with rope , into place . It was very heavy . Baldwin had not seen Collins ' face since they had lifted him from the snow at Hochih . He could not open the bedroll now and say good-bye . But he clambered over , after the men had rested it on the floor boards , and his hand went out , resting gently on the coarse , field-green twill that covered the bedroll . Underneath , he knew there would always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was charging him and there was the dump to be blown , and Baldwin knew he could do it . It occurred to Baldwin now , as he knelt by the body in the bedroll , that Su-Piao had said yesterday that only the strong and the cruel survived . And here he was , sending Miller and Lewis and Collins on ahead . Miller and Lewis were weak . But was Collins ? ' What was it that made him know he would always remember Collins ? Because he was good ? Or because of all the people being killed in this war hurling masses upon masses of men against each other , Collins alone had known , when the rock was hammering , that he had died on a personal purpose . Everyone else died out of strategy , or by accident . Collins had died , doing something he wanted to do . Doing something good . Was it weak to be good ? How quick and live the boy 's face had been , how it could glow . Baldwin touched the bedroll , whispered good-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " O.K. , Miller , take off ! " he yelled , and the truck lurched away , the men jovially cursing Miller 's luck in envy . Baldwin watched it go , disturbed by the thought that only the strong and cruel got through .  | CHAPTER 9 Tush a n ! THEY HAD NO TROUBLE finding the dumps , which lay exactly where Kwan 's directions said they should be  --  back through town , four miles west of the railway station , through a wooden gate in a long bamboo fence that ran along the spine of a ridge . And by the gate , a dozen Chinese soldiers were waiting to help them , as headquarters had promised . It was when they had passed the gates , and Baldwin had stopped the truck to look from the ridge down on the hollow that he saw what he had taken on . It was immense . The gray , low wooden buildings must be the warehouses , squat onestory cubes of weathered , unpainted lumber , connected by graveled paths that ran off in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of the hollow . How many were there ? Twenty or thirty , he thought , though his eye had not counted yet . What was in them ?  | Where did you begin ? How did you take apart something like this ? Yet the vast field of sheds challenged him . Listening to the men talk behind him as they scrambled out to look too , he knew he could do it because this team was a tool , an instrument , committed to his hand ; a precise , and elaborate tool that the United States Army had somehow thrown together from American skill . And he knew how to use it , finally . The blow itself only took figuring out . Behind him , as he gazed , he could hear someone yelp : " Jackpot ! Man , do you suppose these sheds are really loaded ? " " Frigging Chinese , " he could hear Michaelson exploding , " so that 's where they been hiding it . We give them all this stuff , they hide it in these frigging hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he heard Prince saying . " My back is still aching from the last job  --  we got a whole day 's work here . " " Mike , " he heard Ballo asking , " you absolutely sure that this is the last one we got to do on the road ? " and Michaelson replying , gruffly but not in anger , " What 's the matter , soldier , you want me to tattoo it on your butt ? " and he could tell that Michaelson was excited , too . They waited for Baldwin to say something , but Baldwin was in no hurry . lle could tell by the tone of their growling , by the bubble of excitement in their voices , that the itch of destruction was working in them again . The thing to do was to keep the excitement high as they worked , but his own mind clear so that he could fit the facts together and work out exactly how it should be done . When his mind had told him what to do , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill air braced him . The thing to do was to break the job down into parts , but get the facts first .  | He turned back to them . " We have plenty of time , " he said , " and we 'll be out of Tushan this afternoon if we get our backs into it . This could be the best blow of the summer . If we handle it right . Any of you ever blow an ammunition dump before ? " There was no answer . " All right , " he said , " neither have I. But it should n't be far different from the Liuchow blow . First we split up to find out what there is . There are three rows . Mike , you and Ballo take your truck and scout the off-left row . Prince , you and Niergaard , do the off-right row . I 'll take the center row . " He was counting now and he saw there were twelve sheds in each long row , and he continued : " Let 's see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in about forty-five minutes , and we 'll count up what there is and what we have to do . " And at last he could say what he had been wanting to say since the night of Liuchow . He could make them a promise . " And this is the last one . The YOKE troops are making a new line with new Chinese troops from Burma about thirty or forty miles north of here . That 's where they 're going to stop the Japanese . I would n't be surprised if that 's the end of the show in China . This may be the last big blow any of you will ever see . We 'll be into Kweiyang and Kunming as soon as we finish and you can all sit around in Kunming and get fat until they blow the whistle . So let 's make it good . " They were back within the time set , simmering , all of them . It was big , bigger even than Baldwin had thought . There was everything . There was artillery of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire shed of American pack-75s , all new , all with original cosmolene still greasing their parts , never used . There was a shed full of rifles and another of machine guns , with English and American , French  | and German , Russian and Chinese markings of origin . " Some of the stuff 's real old , " said Niergaard , " there 's rust on these old cases and one of them says 1918 . " There were mortars and mines , pistols and flares , and in Baldwin 's row he had come across three full sheds of small arms ammunition , of every marking , of Skoda , Winchester , Armstrong , Brandt and Krupp . There was one entire shed of TNT  --  German , French , Japanese and American TNT . There were at least two sheds of mortar shells , another shed of shells for 75s , another shed of 105 ammunition , all of them distributed about the dump without apparent reason or system . And then , in one shed , in a fanciful aberration of good order , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , apparently only because everything in the shed was British  --  old British twenty-five pounders , Lee-Enfield rifles , mines , old imperial twenty millimeter ammunition that fitted no gun Baldwin had heard of . Some roving English arms-merchant had , perhaps , long ago , made a killing in selling the trash of the first war to some forgotten warlord who had been snuffed out by the Central Government ; and his hoard had now ended here in the shadow of the Asian plateau . Michaelson reported he had found drums full of fuel in one shed . " I guess some of it 's gasoline , " he said , " but some of it , I guess , is alcohol . It smells like orange juice , do you suppose they made the stuff out of oranges ? " Prince summed it up : " Now I know why they call them dumps  --  they must have bought everything they could lay their hands on and dumped it all right here . They got everything to fight a war , except Confederate money . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dealing with . Thirty-six sheds . And , calculating in his mind , at one thousand to fifteen hundred tons to a shed , it would be forty to fifty thousand tons of ammunition and gear that lay before him ! Too much , too much to handle in one afternoon .  | And yet too little . It was so clear to him now , all the arguments they had had at staff back at Kunming , as to what the Chinese were doing with what the army was giving them , whether the Generalissimo was hiding it , or saving it , or stealing it . Here , in these gray sheds , was the strategic reserve of a nation . Down there , at the far end of the rickety little rail spur which led from these dumps to the mainline in Kwangsi , then up the steaming hot paddies of Kwangsi to Hunan and the front , down there half a million  --  perhaps a million  --  Chinese troops had waited , facing the Jap for six years , nursing on this . Out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had beseeched or cajoled from the outer world , built of the bargains he had made with wandering hucksters of obsolete weapons through the years  --  out of this , the Generalissimo had had to face the power of the Japanese with their industry and their science . Baldwin found himself saddened by the pathetic dilemma , thinking as he knew the Chinese command in Chungking must have been thinking : How does one spoon-feed a starved and diminishing mob of soldiers at the far end of the railways , shell by shell , ton by ton , weighing each shipment against each judgment , each spy 's report on the loyalty , or vigor , or courage of the unit and the commander who pleaded for more to fight with . And so the Chinese command had hoarded and hoarded it , hoarded it to fight against the Japanese when the emergency might come in one last battle , hoarded it against calculations of other wars , with other Chinese , when this war might be over . Hoarded it , in fear , until it had become not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now finally was useless and he , Baldwin , an American major , must erase it from the balance .  | Su-Piao had been translating to Kwan as the men made their report and now Kwan spoke , his body almost trembling in anger . " Now , now everything must be destroyed , " he said . " Why , of course , " said Baldwin calmly . " As much as we can . " " Everything , everything , " said Kwan . " What 's the matter ? " Baldwin asked . " Nothing for the Japanese when they come , " said Kwan , " nothing for anybody . There is no way , now we must do it . " " He 's right , " said Su-Piao , her voice tense with emotion , too . " he 's right , it has to be wiped out . " Baldwin looked at her . He could not see why she was excited ; of course he was going to do the job , that was why he was here . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We could have used it down front , we could have used it . Why did n't they use it ? What were they keeping it for ? T'ung-ling had two hundred shells for a battery at Changsha ; the soldiers had fifty bullets a man . At Hengyang , they let each gun fire two shells a day , just two shells . We had nothing to fight with , and it was here all the time ; it was right here , they could have sent it to us . It 's nobody 's , I tell you , nobody 's , you have to destroy all of it . " She hated it , he could see , and so did Kwan ; they hated this dump more than anything else they had been through on the road . Perhaps , somehow , because the cold dumps here in the cold sky had been more important in the calculations at the Chun-ling- ? u than soldiers , or troops , or life itself . Here was what the Generalissimo had bought or begged , and it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced him to being the client of other men and other strategies . But the Generalissimo had a point , too . Baldwin could see  | it clearly as if it were his own command problem . There had to be a strategic reserve ; war was n't a chess game where you committed your last piece and then there was nothing . And the Japanese had to come after this reserve ; and someone had to blow it before they got there . And he was the man . It was simple . There was no point in getting excited . The only problem was how . He had to think it out alone , so he walked away from them to be quiet and sat on the edge of the road that ran along the ridge in the lee of the bamboo fence . There was nothing in the Field Manual about a dump ; he had thumbed through its pages so often he could almost remember each section heading . The manual listed all techniques for all objectives , but nothing about a dump . Probably because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major retreats and the U. S. Army had no manual on major retreats . We 're probably the only Army in the world that has n't had to plan a major retreat , he thought . We do n't retreat . Grimly , he told himself ? not yet . And then  --  what the hell are we doing now ? But it 's not our retreat , it 's theirs . How much is it ours , he asked himself , what 's this going to cost ? Then with an effort , he pulled himself together , reaching down through the vagrant groping of his mind to grasp the problem . In a while , he had it worked out and called the men together . " There 's some stuff we 're going to have to leave , " he said , " and some stuff we absolutely have to blow . The rifles and the machine guns . We ca n't do anything about them , and so we 'll forget them . If the sheds burn and the cases burn , well and good ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good either . " Then there 's the artillery . We 'd have to set off a thermite charge in each barrel to fuse the metal , and we have n't got thermite . Or we 'd have to set off a block of TNT in every  | breach and that 's handwork , and could take us hours . I 'll leave the artillery pieces to Kwan 's Chinese soldiers  --  we 'll have them smash out the traversing mechanisms on every piece they can find , the same mechanism on every piece so the Jap ca n't cannibalize parts and replace . Would you explain that to Kwan ? " he finished , turning to Su-Piao , who translated to Kwan , who nodded enthusiastically . " Then , " went on Baldwin , " the gasoline and alcohol , that 's standard and we can see whether it burns when the sheds burn or it 's fifteen minutes of S.O.P. to put bullets through the drums . " Now that leaves the ammunition , " he said quite clearly for it was all clear in his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of this job . It 's all stacked for safety , with good separation , so that could make it tough . But 1 think it 's almost certain that one block of TNT , to each shed , as a primer , will kick off any case of shells and the impact of concussion will kick off everything else in any one shed . But that 's not absolutely certain . If each stack of shells has to be blown individually , we 'd have to manhandle these stacks together to get an impact effect . Which means Kwan would have to go back in town and get more labor troops to help us shove all the ammo in any one shed into one big stack so that each shed will go with a single charge . " What we ought to do is try one of these sheds for size right away , and if we need more troops , Kwan can go back in and get them now . " I 'm going to try the first one myself . The far shed in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the stacks , and if it goes then any other shed will go , too , when we 're ready . " All right then , " he concluded , his orders brisk , " Kwan gets his Chinese trooDS to work right now . I take off and case  | the far shed of mortar shells . Mike , I want to work this dump on the same field-net we tried at Liuchow . We 'll run firing wire down the field , and feed twelve cross-ties of primacord from it . Each cross-tie carries three caps to detonate a couple of blocks of TNT in each shed . Get the wire ready . Get the primacord ready for hooking in . Get out about forty or fifty half-pound blocks of TNT and prime them . If you get through that before I try that shed , you can eat . If the shed goes as easily as it should , then all we have to do is string the stuff down the field . Blow it . And get out . " When I get ready to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flare from where I am . That means Kwan gets his Chinese back off the field up here into this drainage ditch by the road for cover . That 's when you take cover , too . When the Chinese are back off the field , give me two shots from your carbine as a signal , and I 'll blow it . Have you got it ? " " Got it , " said Mike . " Does Kwan understand ? " he asked Su-Piao . " He understands , " she replied in a moment . He turned away to assemble the TNT and the primacord he needed for the shed . He wanted to test the shed alone and by himself ; if anything went wrong he did not want to lose another man ; he had lost one already to his conscience . But when he got into his jeep , he found Su-Piao already there . " What are you doing ? " he asked . " I 'm supposed to be with you , are n't I ? " she asked . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you want to ? " " Why , of course , " she said , and a round full smile flourished on her face . He knew it would look ridiculous to the men to see him driving off with the woman , but he did not care . He enjoyed the thought of taking her along to see this last large thing he had to do . He thought quickly  --  what will I do when she 's gone ? And knew he did not want her to be  | gone . They had come a long road together ; he was somehow a different person now than he had been three days ago ; she was part of it . He stabbed the gas treadle hard , the jeep took off . Everything would go well , because she expected him to make it go that way . It was the first time they had been alone together since Thursday on the crest above the sidehill blow , and so much had happened since . He had seen her angry ; seen her in despair last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have closed the deal on the dump without her . He noticed now , watching her face out of the corner of his eye as he drove , that her head was high , her eyes bright , that she sat as erect and gracefully on the bouncing seat of the jeep as if she were in a saddle . He , too , sat straight , not hunched over the wheel as he usually did , and wanted this day to do a clean , quick , effective job that she would remember ; he did not want her to forget him . In the far-off shed , with its empty , abandoned silence , she followed him down the aisles of chest-high stacks of mortar shells . The black stencilings on most of the cases were Chinese markings ; but several piles were stacked only with the yellow triple-tube cases of new American 81 mm. mortar shells . He scanned the long shed quickly , trying to organize what he must do in a precise procedure ; then he went back to the jeep , brought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a toolkit , and squatted on the ground . She squatted beside him , and he was aware simultaneously of the great stillness , the bitter cold and that the curve of her leg from knee to ankle was perfect and firm . As she watched , he tied the blocks of TNT together , deftly inserted the bronze cap in one of the prepared holes in the block , pulled out his crimping tool and crimped the prima-  | cord into the cap . Next he cut a length of twine from the ball in the kit , circled the block twice with the twine , looped it over the primacord , knotted it , and tugged the primacord to see if it would come loose . He was making a show of it , he knew , as he tied the knots firmly and squarely , but he wanted the moment to linger . " It 's like sewing , " she said as she watched his fingers work . " You do n't want the cap to jerk out of the block , " he explained matter-of-factly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block so that the cap is secure inside . It 's Standard Operating Procedure . " " It sounds complicated . " " It 's not , really , it 's all in the book . " " What book ? " " There 's a book for everything in the army , everything 's been figured out  --  there are books for attack and assault , for roads and cooking , for burial , ordnance , survey , supply , signals , repair . We 're engineers , so ours is the book for demolition . " " Do you mean a real book ? " she asked as if he were teasing . " Here , " he said , reaching back to his hip pocket where the brown-paper pamphlet had sat all week , " it 's an Engineers Field Manual . " " TM 5-23 . Engineers Field Manual . Explosives and Demolition . January 12 , 1942 , " she read aloud from the cover . " Do you mean you have to study this ? " " We know pretty well what we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it 's got a lot of formulas in it that save paper work ; and some odd information on situations that arise that we 've had no experience with in this theatre . " He had to pull himself away . There was work to do . He rose to his feet , lifted a carton of mortar shells from its rack .  | He unscrewed the cover , crammed the block of TNT in , bound it down with more twine , manhandled it back in place . She had been reading the book and now she was reading the table of contents , almost in amusement . " Why , it 's how to blow up everything  --  look , here it is , tunnels , railroads and rolling stock , oil and gasoline , telegraph and telephone lines , frame buildings , wells , artillery , wire entanglements , stump blasting , ditching  --  why , it 's a science . " " No , " said Baldwin , " it 's a technique . You can learn it . People who stay in the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . He had never thought of it . The Army ran on brains and learning . " It must be more than schools , " she said aloud , giving the manual back to him . " Learning is n't enough . We used to think so . In some parts of China the God of Scholars and the God of War share the same temple . In some places he 's the same god and he 's called Wen-Ti . ' It does n't help , though . Somehow we got off the track . " He saw her face fall and a soft melancholy erased her expression . There would be time later to talk to her , he wanted to see how this would work , now . " We 're ready , " he said . She rose and he lifted the little plastic reel of primacord from the ground . He stooped for the toolkit but she had reached it first and had it . Letting the cord unravel through his fingers , he backed out of the shed , Su-Piao following with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the distance from the shed that receded in the distance , he explained , " We 've got to give it good distance , I do n't know how it will work . " He was annoyed because the little plastic reels came only in loo-foot lengths and he wanted 300 feet between him and the blow . He was aware now that they were about to make a blast in a  | field of high explosives and that the bowels of the earth would rend if anything went wrong ; and that she had no idea of what the-primacord might do ; or else she did not care . He stopped at the jeep and spliced two more reels together , strode out their length to the end , told her to get into the drainage ditch for shelter while he brought the jeep to the ditch beside them ; and then finally joined her . When he joined her in the ditch , he dropped down again beside her and she handed the greenish-yellow , rough-waxy cord to him and he cut it with a knife , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire ? " she asked . " No , it 's primacord , the highest-speed explosive we make . It goes twenty thousand feet a second , the book says . It 's instantaneous for all practical purposes . You touch a match to this end and as soon as you touch the match to it , it 's flashed at the other end . Really good stuff . " " Now ? " she asked . " No , " he said , " I have to send up a flare to warn Kwan 's Chinese soldiers off the field and back up to the ditch on the ridge . Then Michaelson will fire off his carbine when the field is clear , and I 'll try it . " He climbed out of the ditch once more , cocked the flare pistol in the air , pulled , and the pink-shell traced a lazy , languid parabola of light in the blue sky . It would take several minutes of waiting to get the Chinese back in and he enjoyed the thought of these minutes suspended unavoidably , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , " she asked , " when it goes  --  then there 'll be nothing left ? " " This takes out the shed of mortars . If that goes well , we can hook the whole field up in about two hours work , and take it out all at once . Then there 'll be nothing left . "  | " That 's good , " she said complacently , and then , " but it 's sad , too . Nothing at all ? " " Oh , " he said , savoring the masculine moment , " the artillery will be here , but if Kwan does his job on smashing the traversing mechanisms , it 'll be useless , and in time it will rust , and after a while there 'll be nothing at all left . " " Just rust , " she said , reflecting , " just rust , that 's all that 's left of us . But they tried , our government did try , you know they did . " " Yes , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her this way . It had been a bad campaign , but the war was won . " I wish . . . " she said . " There 's a poem . . . " " A poem about this ? " he asked , inviting her on . Her voice fell across his ears , rich and warm . It was Chinese , but more beautiful than he had ever heard it . " What 's that ? " he asked . " It 's a poem . It 's a thousand years old . By a man called Tu Fu , about some king 's abandoned palace . " " What 's it like ? " " Something like this , I think : ' Of what dead prince , this palace ? Beneath these hills , who graced this ruined hall ? The beauty of his maidens now is yellow dust , Their paints and colors faded , gone . Of those who danced attendance on his golden chariot , None remain But this , among these relics  --  a horse of graven stone . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing girls , and no golden chariots . I do n't mind that . But I mind their finding among  | our relics only rusty old cannon we did n't make . I 'd rather they found one graven horse we left behind , some one thing of beauty we made . Because we tried , our government tried ; we did . try . And we 're leaving nothing , no memory , no beauty . " Baldwin was embarrassed . Sometimes he read the poems at the end of the page in the Atlantic Monthly , but he was embarrassed if someone saw him reading them . He hoped he would not be embarrassed again , when he got back . He thought not . Aloud , he said : " I never studied any Chinese poetry . It 's quite different from ours . " " No , " she said , " it 's almost the same . I read all your poetry when I was in America . Do you know sometimes I would go to tea at our professor 's house , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all poetry . . . until this trip . Americans are hard too , are n't they ? I think . . . I think I learned only the poetry in America , and all you 've seen in China is this road , and how cruel we are . " " I would n't say that , " answered Baldwin quickly , stirred somehow . " I 've learned as much on this trip as you learned in Boston , I 've learned ... " He stopped . He did not know what he had learned . But he was aware of her hand , on his arm , holding him softly but tight , and her deep black eyes , looking at him , and her voice , urgent . " Tell me , tell me ! What have you learned ? It 's important to me . Is there anything you 've learned in China ? I do n't know what I am , I learned everything I know in American , or in America . Have you learned something here ? Did it give you anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rap of Michaelson 's carbine . A double shot . Then another double shot . They were ready . " It 's time now , " he said , reluctantly freeing his arm from  | her fingers , but relieved that he did not have to answer the question . He knelt to the cord on the ground . He took a kitchen match out of its glass vial , scraped it along the sole of his boot until the round head spat at him , and held it upside down so that the shaft of the match might catch . Then he touched it gently and carefully to the frayed cord and with the most fleeting of hisses , the cord had disappeared and was gone . " What happened ? " asked Su-Piao . " In a sec . . . " But as he spoke a hammer sound pounded through the air , and then a racketing , bouncing series of cracks as if firecrackers were going off . " It 's going , " he said , " but it 's not going on simultaneous impact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch and the bank shuddered above them , and he reached out an arm and pulled her close and they both buried their faces in the ground . " Damn , " he said , holding her close , " damn those mortar shells . They 're ricocheting and kicking each other off one by one , and they 're going up and coming down here . " Another shell slammed beside them and he knew they must run for it , and he grabbed her elbow and yelled , " We ca n't stay here , we 've got to run for it . " She looked at him , not hearing through the din , and he yelled as loud as he could . " We 've got to run ! To the shed ! The stuff is making a fountain , it 's mortar shells , we 'll be safer the closer we are to the shed . " He lifted himself to his knees , and , with an effort , grabbed her elbow to haul her up . She was hitching her skirt and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could run , and then they were both out of the ditch and  | running to the shed . As they ran , his hasty , frightened eye could see what was happening . The roof of the shed had fallen in , and yellow and black smoke was pouring from the fallen roof . Occasional fire gashes streaked the smoke and black objects hurtled out into the sky , arcing dark across the blue , falling again , exploding with geysers of dirt , and a roseyellow flower of flame at the center of each instant burst . They stumbled into the drainage ditch that ran about the burning , thundering shed , and lay there . She was beside him , and he was holding her . The fountain of shells was going fine now ; he could hear explosions inside the shed , explosions all about them ; explosions hundreds of yards away . But they were within the arch of the spray and they could lie and hear the ground pound , and pound , and pound and shudder around them . She pressed closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud blasts from inside the shed ripped the volleying , a final thud and bang resounded further away , and after that they were silent , still clutching . There was nothing to say and she looked at him , very close . Curiously she was smiling . " Do you know what I was thinking ? " she asked in the quiet . He shook his head , being comfortable in the moment , being glad he was alive , hoping she did not notice she was in his arms , not wanting to stir . " I was thinking you Americans may have put it all down in your book . But it was the Chinese who invented firecrackers . " He smiled and said : " I was n't thinking at all . We almost got killed . " But he held on to her . She lay there for a moment in his arms and he did not know whether he was holding her because it happened that way , or because of the warmth in the           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
