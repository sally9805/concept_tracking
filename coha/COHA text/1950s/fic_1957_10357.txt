time understanding one another than sun and water did to make rain . They never no more needed to be drawed together than sun and water needed to be . In fact , most of Manfred 's work had already been done for him by that boy back in Frenchman 's Bend  --  McCarron , who except that he come first , could a been Manfred 's younger brother ; who never even lived in Frenchman 's Bend and nobody in Frenchman 's Bend ever seen or heard of him before that summer , like he had been sent through Frenchman'sBend at the one exact moment to see her , like you might say Manfred de Spain had been sent through Jeffersonat the one exact moment to see her . And a heap of McCarron 's work already done for him too because she done it : that night when them five Frenchman'sBend boys laid for them and bushwacked them in the buggy to drag him out of it and maybe beat him up or anyhow skeer him out of Frenchman 's Bend . And graduallythe tale come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought them all off and got the buggy turned around and got her back home all safe except for a natural maiden swoon . Which ai nt quite right . Because them five boys ( I knowed two of them ) never told it , which you might say is proof . That after they broke his arm it was her that taken the loaded end of the buggy-whip and finished the last one or maybe two , and her that turned the buggy around in the road and got it away from there . Jest far enough ; not back home yet : jest far enough ; to as the feller says crown the triumph on the still-hot field of the triumph ; right there on the ground in the middle of the dark road because somebody had to still hold that skeered horse , with the horse standing over them and her likely having to help hold him up too off of that broke arm ; not jest her first time but the time she got that baby . Which folks says ai nt likely to happen jest the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , I do nt never have trouble picking ought . But Lawyer Stevens never understood her and neverp101would : that he never had jest Manfred de Spain to have to cope with , he was faced with a simple natural force repeatingitself under the name of De Spain or McCarron or whatever into ever gap or vacancy in her breathing as long as she breathed ; and that would n't never none of them be him . And he never did realise that she understood him because she never had no way of telling him because she did n't know herself how she done it . Since women learn at about two or three years old and then forget it , the knowledgeabout their-selves that a man stumbles on by accident forty-odd years later with the same kind of startled amazementof finding a twenty-five-cent piece in a old pair of britches you had started to throw away . No , they do nt forget it : they jest put it away until ten or twenty or forty years later the need for it comes up and they reach around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again without no more remembering jest which one it was than she could remember today which finger it was she scratched with yesterday : only that tomorrow maybe she will itch again but she will find something to scratch that one with too . Or I do nt know , maybe he did understand all that and maybe he did get what he wanted . I mean , not what he wanted but what he knew he could have , the next best , like anything is better than nothing , even if that anything is jest a next-best anything . Because there was more folks among the Helens and Juliets and Isoldes and Guineveres than jest the Launcelots and Tristrams and Romeos and Parises . There was them others that never got their names in the poetry books , the next-best ones that sweated and panted too . And being the next-best to Paris is jest a nextbesttoo , but it ai nt no bad next-best to be . Not ever body had Helen , but then not ever body lost her neither . So I kind of happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jitney drove up and Lawyer got out with his grips and trunk and his ticket to Mottstown junctionto catch the express from Memphis to New York and get on the boat that would take him to that Germanp102university he had been talking for two years now about what a good idea it would be to go to it providing you happened to want to go to a university in Germany like that one ; until that morning yesterday or maybe it was the day before when he told his paw : " What must I do now , Papa ? Papa , what can I do now ? " It was still cold , so he taken his sister on into the waiting room and then he come back out where I was . " Good , " he says , brisk and chipper as you could want . " I was hoping to see you before I left , to pass the torch on into your active hand . You 'll have to hold the fort now . You 'll have to tote the load . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jefferson , " he says . " Snopeses . Think you can handle them till I get back ? " " Not me nor a hundred of me , " I says . " The only thing to do is get completely shut of them , abolish them . " " No no , " he says . " Say a herd of tigers suddenly appears in Yoknapatawpha County ; would n't it be a heap better to have them shut up in a mule-pen where we could at least watch them , keep up with them , even if you do lose a arm or a leg ever time you get within ten feet of the wire , than to have them roaming and strolling loose all over ever where in the entire country ? No , we got them now ; they 're ourn now ; I do nt know jest what Jefferson could a committed back there whenever it was , to have won this punishment , gained this right , earned this privilege . But we did . So it 's for us to cope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can ) survive . " " But why me ? " I says . " Why out of all Jefferson pick on me ? " " Because you 're the only one in Jefferson I can trust , " Lawyer says . Except that that one do nt really ever lose Helen , because for the rest of her life she do nt never actively get rid of him . Likely it 's because she do nt want to.  |p103I  remember how Ratliff once said that the world 's Helens never really lose forever the men who once loved and lost them ; probably because they  --  the Helens  --  do nt want to . I still was n't born when Uncle Gavin left for Heidelberg , so as far as I know his hair had already begun to turn white when I first saw him . Because although I was born by then , I could n't remember him when he came home from Europe in the middle of the War , to get ready to go back to it . He said that at first , right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he finished his Ph.D . he was going as a stretcher-bearer with the German army ; almost up to the last second before he admitted to himself that the Germany he could have loved that well had died somewherebetween the Liege and Namur forts and the year 1848 . Or rather , the Germany which had emerged between 1848 and the Belgian forts he did not love since it was no longer the Germany of Goethe and Bach and Beethoven and Schiller . This is what he said hurt , was hard to admit , to admit even after he reached Amsterdam and could begin to really ask about the American Field Service of which he had heard . But he said how we  --  America  --  were not used yet to European wars and still took them seriously ; and there was the fact that he had been for two years a student in a Germanuniversity . But the French were different : to whom another Germanic war was just the same old chronic nuisance ; a nation of practical and practising pessimists who were willing to let anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything  --  particularly one who was willing to do it free . So he  --  Uncle Gavin  --  spent those five months with his stretcher just behind Verdun and presently was himself in a bed in an American hospital until he got over the pneumonia and could come home , inp104Jefferson again , waiting , he said , until we were in it , which would not be long . And he was right : the Sartoris boys , Colonel Sartoris 's twin grandsons , had already gone to England into the Royal Flying Corps and then it was April and then Uncle Gavin had his appointment as a Y.M.C.A. secretary , to go back to France with the first American troops ; when suddenly there was Montgomery Ward Snopes , the first of what Ratliff called " them big gray-colored chaps of I.O. 's , " the one whose mama was still rocking in the chair in the front window of the Snopes Hotel because it was still too cold yet to move back onto the front gallery . And Jackson McLendon had organized his Jefferson companyand had been elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But instead he came to Uncle Gavin , to go to France with Uncle Gavin in the Y.M.C.A. ; and that was when Ratliff said what he did about sometimes the men that loved and lost Helen of Troy just thought they had lost her . Only he could have added , All her kinfolks too . Because Uncle Gavin did it . I mean , took Montgomery Ward . " Confound it , Lawyer , " Ratliff said . " It 's a Snopes . " " Certainly , " Uncle Gavin said . " Can you suggest a betterplace for a Snopes today than northwestern France ? Asfar west of Amiens and Verdun as you can get him ? " " But why ? " Ratliff said . " I thought of that too , " Uncle Gavin said . " If he had said he wanted to go in order to defend his country , I would have had Hub Hampton handcuff him hand and foot in jail and sit on him while I telephoned Washington . But what he said was , They 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I go with you like you 're going , I figger I 'll get there first and have time to look around . ' " " To look around , " Ratliff said . He and Uncle Gavin looked at one another . Ratliff blinked two or three times.  | " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . Ratliff blinked two or three times again . " To look around , " he said . " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . And Uncle Gavin took MontgomeryWard Snopes with him and that was the exact time when Ratliff said about the folks that thought they had finally lost Helen of Troy . But Gowan was still living with us ; maybe because of the war in Europe the State Departmentstill had n't let his mother and father come back from China or wherever it was yet ; at least once every week on the way home across the Square he would meet Ratliff , almost like Ratliff was waiting for him , and Gowan would tell Ratliff the news from Uncle Gavin and Ratliff would say : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the best I can here . " " The best you can what ? " Gowan said . " Holding and toting , " Ratliff said . " Holding and toting what ? " Gowan said . That was when Gowan said he first noticed that you did n't notice Ratliff hardly at all , until suddenly you did or anyway Gowan did . And after that , he began to look for him . Because the next time , Ratliff said : " How old are you ? " " Seventeen , " Gowan said . " Then of course your aunt lets you drink coffee , " Ratliff said . " What do you say  --  " " She 's not my aunt , she 's my cousin , " Gowan said . " Sure . I drink coffee . I do nt specially like it . Why ? " " I like a occasional ice-cream cone myself , " Ratliff said . " What 's wrong with that ? " Gowan said . " What say me and you step in the drugstore here and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gowan said Ratliff always had strawberry when they had it , and that he could expect Ratliff almost any afternoon now and now Gowan said he was in for it , he would have to eatp106the cone whether he wanted it or not , he and Ratliff now standing treat about , until finally Ratliff said , already holding the pink-topped cone in his brown hand : " This here is jest about as pleasant a invention as any I know about . It 's so pleasant a feller jest do nt dare risk getting burnt-out on it . I cant imagine no tragedy worse than being burnt-out on strawberry ice cream . So what you say we jest make this a once-a-week habit and the rest of the time jest swapping news ? " So Gowan said all right and after that they would just meet in passing and Gowan would give Ratliff Uncle Gavin 's last message : " He says to tell you he 's doing the best he can too but that you were right : just one ai nt enough . One what ? " Gowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then Gowan was seventeen ; he had a few other things to do , whether grown people believed it or not , though he did n't object to delivering the messages Mother said Uncle Gavin sent in his letters to Ratliff , when he happened to see Ratliff , or that is when Ratliff saw , caught him , which seemed to be almost every day so that he wondered just when Ratliff found time to earn a living . But he did n't always listen to all Ratliff would be saying at those times , so that afterward he could n't even say just how it was or when that Ratliff put it into his mind and he even got interested in it like a game , a contest or even a battle , a war , that Snopeses had to be watched constantly like an invasion of snakes or wildcats and that Uncle Gavin and Ratliff were doing it or trying to because nobody else in Jefferson seemed to recognise the danger . So that winter when the draft finally came and got Byron Snopes out of Colonel Sartoris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about when he said : " I do nt know how he will do it but I will lay a million to one he do nt never leave the United States ; I will lay a hundred to one he wont get further away from Mississippi than that first fort over in Arkansas where they first sendsp107them ; and if you will give me ten dollars I will give you eleven if he ai nt back here in Jefferson in three weeks . " Gowan did n't do it but he said later he wished he had because Ratliff would have lost by two days and so Byron was back in the bank again . But we did n't know how and even Ratliff never found out how he did it until after he had robbed the bank and escaped to Mexico , because Ratliff said the reason Snopeses were successful was that they had all federated unanimously to remove being a Snopes from just a zoological category into a condition composed of success by means of the single rule and regulation and sacred oath of never to tell anybody how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed every night with a fresh plug of chewing tobacco taped into his left armpit until it ran his heart up to where the army doctors finally discharged him and sent him home . So at least there was some fresh Snopes news to send Uncle Gavin , which was when Ratliff noticed that it had been months since Uncle Gavin had mentioned Montgomery Ward Snopes . Though by the time Uncle Gavin 's letter got back saying Do n't mention that name to me again . I wont discuss it . I will not we had some fresh Snopes news of our own to send him . This time it was Eck . " Your uncle was right , " Ratliff said . " He 's my cousin , I tell you , " Gowan said . " All right , all right , " Ratliff said . " Eck was n't a Snopes . That 's why he had to die . Like there was n't no true authenticroom for Snopeses in the world and they made theirselvesone by that pure and simple mutual federation , and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it do nt even need the rest of the pack like wolves to finish him : simple environment jest watched its chance and taken it . " Eck was the one with the steel brace where a log broke his neck one time , the night watchman of the oilp108company 's storage tank at the depot ; I knew about this myself because I was almost four years old now . It was just dust-dark ; we were at supper when there came a tremendous explosion , the loudest sound at one time that Jefferson ever heard , so loud that we all knew it could n't be anything else but that German bomb come at last that we  --  Mayor de Spain  --  had been looking for ever since the Germans sank the Lusitania and we finally had to get into the War too . That is , Mayor de Spain had gone to West Point and had been a lieutenant in Cuba and when this one started he wanted to get into it too . But he could n't maybe , so he tried to organize a Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously . But at least he had an alarm system to ring the courthouse bell when a German attack came . So when that tremendous big sound went off and the bell began to ring , we all knew what it was and we were all waiting for the next one to fall , until the people running out into the street hollering " Which way was it ? " finally located it down toward the depot . It was the oil storage tank . It was a big round tank , about thirty feet long and ten feet deep , sitting on brick trestles . That is , it had been there because there was n't anything there now , not even the trestles . Then about that time they finally got Mrs Nunnery to hush long enough to tell what happened . She was Cedric Nunnery 's mamma . He was about five years old . They lived in a little house just up the hill from the depot and finally they made her sit down and somebody gave her a drink of whiskey and she quit screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedric anywhereand she came down to where Mr Snopes was sitting in his chair in front of the little house about the size of a privy that he called the office where he night-watched the tank , to ask him if he had seen Cedric . He had n't but he got up right away to help her hunt , in all the box cars on the side track and in the freight warehouse and everywhere , holler/ing Cedric 's name all around ; only Mrs Nunnery did n't remember which of them thought of the oil tank first . Likely it was Mr Snopes since he was the one that knew it was empty , though probably Mrs Nunnery had seen the ladder too still leaning against it where Mr Snopes had climbed up to open the manhole in the top to let fresh air come in and drive the gas out . And likely Mr Snopes thought all the gas was out by now , though they probably both must have figured there would still be enough left to fix Cedric when he climbed down inside . Because Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was dead ; she said she was so sure that she could n't even bear to wait and see , she was already running  --  not running anywhere : just running  --  when Mr Snopes came out of his little office with the lighted lantern and still running while he was climbing up the ladder and still running when he swung the lantern over into the manhole ; that is she said she was still running when the explosion ( she said she never even heard it , she never heard anything , or she would have stopped ) knocked her down and the air all around her whizzing with pieces of the tank like a swarm of bumblebees . And Mr Harker from the power-plant that got there first and found her , said she begun to try to run again as soon as he picked her up , shrieking and screaming and thrashing around while they held her , until she sat down and drank the whiskey and the rest of them walked and hunted around among the scattered bricks from the trestles , still trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Cedric came at a dead run up the track from where he had been playing in a culvert about a half a mile away when he heard the explosion . But they never did find Mr Snopes until the next morning when Tom Tom Bird , the day fireman at the powerplant , on his way in to work from where he lived about two miles down the track , saw something hanging in thep110telegraph wires about two hundred yards from where the tank had been and got a long pole and punched it down and when he showed it to Mr Harker at the plant , it was Mr Snopes 's steel neck-brace though none of the leather was left . But they never did find anything of Mr Snopes , who was a good man , everybody liked him , sitting in his chair beside the office door where he could watch the tank or walking around the tank when he would let the coal oil run into the cans and drums and delivery tanks , with his neck and head stiff in the steel brace so he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn all of himself like turning a wooden post . All the boys in town knew him because pretty soon they all found out that he kept a meal sack full of raw peanuts from the country and would holler to any of them that passed and give them a handful . Besides , he was a Mason too . He had been a Mason such a long time that he was a good one even if he was n't very high up in it . So they buried the neck-brace anyway , in a coffin all regular , with the Masons in charge of the funeral , and more people than you would have thought sent flowers , even the oil company too although Mr Snopes had ruined their tank for nothing because Cedric Nunnery was n't even in it . So they buried what they did have of him ; there was the Baptist preacher too , and the Masons in their aprons dropping a pinch of dirt into the grave and saying " Alas my brother , " and covered the raw red dirt with the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked into it ) ; and the tank was insured so when the oil company got through cussing Mr Snopes for being a grown man with no more sense than that , they even gave Mrs Snopes a thousand dollars to show they were sorry for her even if she had married a fool . That is , they gave the money to Mrs Snopes because their oldest boy , Wallstreet , was n't but sixteen then . But he was the one that used it.  |p111But  that came later . All that happened now was that Mayor de Spain finally got to be a commanding officer long enough to ring his alarm bell at least , and we had some more fresh Snopes news to send Uncle Gavin . By " we " I mean me now . Gowan 's mother and father had finally got home from China or wherever it was and now Gowan was in Washington ( it was fall ) for the last year anyway at the prep school getting ready for the University of Virginia next year and one afternoon Mother sent for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat faded blue tieless shirt and his smooth brown face , in the parlor like company ( there was a tea tray and Ratliff had a teacup and a cucumber sandwich and I know now there were a lot of people in Jefferson , let alone in the county where Ratliff came from , that would n't have known what to do with a cup of tea at four oclock in the afternoon and maybe Ratliff never saw one before then either but you could n't have told it by watching him ) and Mother said , " Make your manners to Mister Ratliff , bub . He 's come to call on us , " and Ratliff said , " Is that what you call him ? " and Mother said , " No , we just call him whatever is handy yet , " and Ratliff said , " Sometimes fellers named Charles gets called Chick when they gets to school . " Then he said to me : " Do you like strawberry ice-cream cones ? " and I said , " I like any kind of ice-cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cousin  --  " and stopped and said to Mother : " Excuse me , Miz Mallison ; I done been corrected so many times that it looks like it may take me a spell yet . " So after that it was me and Ratliff instead of Gowan and Ratliff , only instead of two cones it cost Ratliff three now because when I went to town without Mother , Aleck Sander was with me . And I do nt know how Ratliff did it and of course I cant remember when because I was n't even five yet . But he had put into my mind too , just likep112into Gowan 's , that idea of Snopeses covering Jefferson like an influx of snakes or varmints from the woods and he and Uncle Gavin were the only ones to recognise the danger and the threat and now he was having to tote the whole load by himself until they would finally stop the war and Uncle Gavin could get back home and help . " So you might just as well start listening now , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to have to hear a heap of it before you get old enough or big enough to resist . " It was November . Then that day , the courthouse bell rang again and all the church bells too this time , wild and frantic too in the middle of the week from the Sunday steeples and a few shotguns and pistols too like the old veterans that were still alive when they unveiled the Confederatemonument that day except that the ones this time had n't been to a war yet , so maybe what they were celebratingthis time was that this one finally got over before they had to go to it . So now Uncle Gavin could come home where Ratliff himself could ask him what MontgomeryWard Snopes had done that his name must not be mentioned or discussed . That was when Ratliff told me , " You might as well get used to hearing it even if you ai nt but five . " That was when he said : " What do you reckon it was he done ? Your cousin has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even taken one all the way to France with him to keep his-self abreast and upto-date . What you reckon a Snopes could a done after ten years to shock and startle him so much he could n't bear even to discuss it ? " Or this was when he meant it because when Uncle Gavin came home it was for only two weeks . He was out of the uniform , the army , the Y.M.C.A. now but as soon as he was out they put him into some kind of board or committee or bureau for war rehabilitation in Europe because he had lived in Europe all that time , especially the two years as a student in Germany . And possibly the only reason he camep113home at all was that Grandfather had died during the last year of the war and he came home to see us as people do in bereavement . Though I believed then that the reason he came was to tell Ratliff what it was about Montgomery Ward Snopes that was too bad to write on paper . Which was when Ratliff said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with him , Ratliff , alone again to tote the load , anyway I could do that much . It was one day ; sometimes Mother let me go to town by myself now . I mean , when she was n't noticing enough to say Come back here . No : I mean , when she found out I had now she did n't jump on me too hard .  --  it was one day , Ratliff 's voice said , " Come here . " He had traded off his buckboard and team and now he had a Model T , with the little painted house with the sewing machine in it fastened to the back in place of a back seat ; what they call pickup trucks now though Ratliff and Uncle Noon Gatewood had made this one . He was sitting in it with the door already open and I got in and he shut the door and we drove right slow along the back streets around the edge of town . " How old did you say you was ? " he said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant help that , can we ? " " Cant help what ? " I said . " Why ? " " Come to think of it , maybe you 're right at that , " he said . " So all we got to do now is jest take a short ride . So what happened to Montgomery Ward Snopes was , he quit the fighting army and went into business . " " What business ? " I said . " The . . . canteen business . Yes , the canteen business . That 's what he done while he was with your cousin . They was at a town named Chalons , only your cousin had to stay in town to run the office , so he give Montgomery Ward , since he had the most spare time , the job of running the canteen at another little town not far away that would be more convenient for the soldiers  --  a kind of a shack with counters like a store where soldiers could buyp114the candy bars and sody pop and hand-knitted socks like your cousin told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy fighting , you remember ? Except that after a while Montgomery Ward 's canteen got to be jest about the most popular canteen the army or even the Y.M.C.A. either ever had in France or anywhere else ; it got so popular that finally your cousin went his-self and looked at it and found that Montgomery Ward had cut off the back end and fixed it up as a new fresh entertainment room with a door in the back and a young French lady he happened to know in it , so that any time a soldier got tired of jest buying socks or eating chocolate bars he could buy a ticket from Montgomery Ward and go around through the back door and get his-self entertained . " That was what your cousin found out . Only the army and the Y.M.C.A. had some kind of a rule against entertainment ; they figgered that a soldier ought to be satisfied jest buying socks and sody pop in a canteen . Or maybe it was your cousin ; likely it was him . Because if the army and the Y.M.C.A. had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery Ward so hard he would likely a come back to Jefferson in handcuffs  --  providing he never stopped off at Leavenworth , Kansas , first . Which reminds me of something I may have said to your other cousin Gowan once when likely you was n't present : about how some of the folks that lost Helen of Troy might some day wish they had n't found her to begin with . " " Why ? " I said . " Where was I if I was n't there then ? " " It was your cousin . Montgomery Ward might have even saved enough out of the back-room entertainment tickets to bought his-self out of it . But he never needed to . He had your cousin . He was the hair-shirt of your cousin 's lost love and devotion , whether he knowed it or not or cared or not . Or maybe it was Jefferson . Maybe your cousin could n't bear the idea of Jefferson being represented in Leavenworth prison even for the reward of one Snopes less in Jeffersonp115itself . So likely it was him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see your face again in France . ' " That is , do nt never bring your face to me again . Because Montgomery Ward was the hair-shirt ; likely your cousin taken the same kind of proud abject triumphant submissive horror in keeping up with his doings that them old hermits setting on rocks out in the hot sun in the desert use to take watching their blood dry up and their legs swivelling , keeping up from a distance while Montgomery Ward added more and more entertaining ladies to that-ere new canteen he set up in Paris  --  " " They have chocolate bars and soda pop in canteens , " I said . " Uncle Gavin said so . Chewing gum too . " " That was the American army , " Ratliff said . " They had been in the war such a short time that likely they had n't got used to it yet . This new canteen of Montgomery Ward 's was you might say a French canteen , with only private American military connections . The French have been in enough wars long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut of one is not to pay too much attention to it . In fact the French probably thought the kind of canteen Montgomery Ward was running this time was just about the most solvent and economical and you might say selfperpetuatingkind he could a picked out , since , no matter how much money you swap for ice cream and chocolate candy and sody pop , even though the money still exists , that candy and ice cream and sody pop do nt any more because it has been consumed and will cost some of that money to produce and replenish , where in jest strict entertainmentthere ai nt no destructive consumption at all that 's got to be replenished at a definite production labor cost : only a normal natural general overall depreciation which would have took place anyhow . " " Maybe Montgomery Ward wont come back to Jefferson , " I said . " If I was him , I would n't , " Ratliff said.  | " Unless he can bring the canteen with him , " I said . " In that case I sholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Gavin you keep on talking about ? " I said . " I 'm sorry , " Ratliff said . " Then why do nt you say so ? " I said . " I 'm sorry , " Ratliff said . " Your uncle . It was your cousin Gowan ( I 'm right this time , ai nt I ? ) got me mixed up but I 'll remember now . I promise it . " Montgomery Ward did n't come home for two years . Though I had to be older than that before I understood what Ratliff meant when he said Montgomery Ward had done the best he knew to bring an acceptable Mississippi version of his Paris canteen back home with him . He was the last Yoknapatawpha soldier to return . One of Captain McLendon 's company was wounded in the first battle in which American troops were engaged and was back in uniform with his wound stripe in 1918 . Then early in 1919 the rest of the company , except two dead from flu and a few in the hospital , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square for a little while . Then in May one of Colonel Sartoris 's twin grandsons ( the other one had been shot down in July last year ) got home from the British Air Force though he did n't have on a uniform at all : just a big low-slung racing car that made the little red E.M.F. that Mayor de Spain used to own look like a toy , driving it fast around town between the times when Mr Connors would have to arrest him for speeding , but mostly about once a week back and forth to Memphis while he was getting settled down again . That is , that 's what Mother said he was trying to do . Only he could n't seem to either , like the war had been too much for him too . I mean , Montgomery Ward Snopes could n't seem to settle down enough from it to come back home , and Bayard Sartoris came home all right but he could n't settle down , driving the car so fast between Sartoris Station and Jefferson that finally Colonel Sartoris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would n't even lend the bank 's money to a man who was going to buy one , gave up the carriage and the matched team , to ride back and forth into town with Bayard in the car , in hopes that maybe that would make Bayard slow it down before he killed himself or somebody else . So when Bayard finally did kill somebody , as we ( all Yoknapatawpha County grown folks ) all expected he would , it was his grandfather . Because we did n't know that either : that Colonel Sartoris had a heart condition ; Doctor Peabodyhad told him that three years ago , and that he had no business in an automobile at all . But Colonel Sartoris had n't told anybody else , not even his sister , Mrs Du Pre that kept house for him : just riding in that car back and forth to town every day to keep Bayard slowed down ( they even managed somehow to persuade Miss Narcissa Benbow to marry him in hopes maybe that would settle him down ) until that morning they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a Negro family in a wagon in the road and Bayard said , " Hold on , Grandfather , " and turned the car off into the ditch ; it did n't turn over or even wreck very bad : just stopped in the ditch with Colonel Sartoris still sitting in it with his eyes still open . So now his bank did n't have a president any more . Then we found out just who owned the stock in it : that Colonel Sartoris and Major de Spain , Mayor de Spain 's father until he died , had owned two of the three biggest blocks , and old man Will Varner out in Frenchman 's Bend owned the other one . So we thought that maybe it was n't just Colonel Sartoris 's father 's cavalry command that got Byron Snopes his job in the bank , but maybe old Will Varner had something to do with it too . Except that we never really believed that since we knew Colonel Sartoris well enough to know that any single one of those old cavalry raids or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough.  |p118Of  course there was more of it , that much again and even more scattered around in a dozen families like the Compsonsand Benbows and Peabodys and Miss Eunice Habershamand us and a hundred others that were farmers around in the county . Though it was n't until Mayor de Spain got elected president of it to succeed Colonel Sartoris ( in fact , because of that ) that we found out that Mr Flem Snopes had been buying the stock in lots anywhere from one to ten shares for several years ; this , added to Mr Varner 's and Mayor de Spain 's own that he had inherited from his father , would have been enough to elect him up from vice president to president ( There was so much going on that we did n't even notice that when the dust finally settled Mr Flem Snopes would be vice president of it too. ) even if Mrs Du Pre and Bayard 's wife ( Bayard had finally got himself killed testing an aeroplane at an Ohio testing field that they said nobody else would fly and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted theirs for him . Because Mayor de Spain resigned from being mayor and sold his automobile agency and became president of the bank just in time . Colonel Sartoris 's bank was a national bank because Ratliff said likely Colonel Sartoris knew that would sound safer to country folks with maybe an extra ten dollars to risk in a bank , let alone the female widows and orphans , since females never had much confidence in menfolks ' doings about anything , let alone money , even when they were not widows too . So with a change of presidentslike that , Ratliff said the government would have to send somebody to inspect the books even if the regular inspection was n't about due ; the two auditors waiting in front of the bank at eight o'clock that morning for somebody to unlock the door and let them in , which would have been Byron Snopes except that he did n't show up . So they had to wait for the next one with a key : which was Mr de Spain . And by fifteen minutes after eight , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books that Byron kept , Mr de Spain found out from the Snopes Hotel that nobody had seen Byron since the southboundtrain at nine twenty-two last night , and by noon everybody knew that Byron was probably already in Texas though he probably would n't reach Mexico itself for another day yet . Though it was not until two days later that the head auditor was ready to commit himself roughly as to how much money was missing ; by that time they had called a meeting of the bank 's board of directors and even Mr Varner that Jefferson never saw once in twelve months had come in and listened to the head auditor for about a minute and then said , " Police hell . Send somebody out home for my pistol , then show me which way he went . " Which was n't anything to the uproar Mr de Spain himself was making , with all this time all Jefferson watching and listening , until on the third day Ratliff said , though I did n't know what he meant then : " That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know now jest how much Miz Flem Snopes is worth . Now your uncle wont need to worry about how much he lost when he gets home because now he can know exactly to the last decimal how much he saved . " Because the bank itself was all right . It was a national bank , so whatever money Byron stole would be guaranteed whether they caught Byron or not . We were watching Mr de Spain . Since his father 's money had helped Colonel Sartoris start it and Mr de Spain had himself been vice president of it , even if he had not been promoted president of it just ahead of when the auditors decided to look at Byron Snopes 's books , we believed he would still have insisted on making good every cent of the money . What we expected to hear was that he had mortgaged his home , and when we did n't hear that , we just thought that he had made money out of his automobile agency that was saved up and put away that we did n't know about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day they called anotherp120sudden meeting of the board of directors and announced the day after that that the stolen money had been made good by the voluntary personal efforts of the president , we were not even surprised . As Ratliff said , we were so unsurprisedin fact that it was two or three days before anybodyseemed to notice how at the same time they announced that Mr Flem Snopes was now the new vice president of it . And now , it was another year , the last two Jefferson soldiers came home for good or anyway temporarily for good : Uncle Gavin finally came back from rehabilitating war-torn Europe to get elected County Attorney , and a few months later , Montgomery Ward Snopes too except that he was just temporarily at home for good , like Bayard Sartoris . He was n't in uniform either but in a black suit and a black overcoat without any sleeves and a black thing on his head kind of drooping over one side like an empty cow 's bladder made out of black velvet , and a long limp-ended bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard and now there was another Snopes business in Jefferson . It had a name on the window that Ratliff did n't know either and when I went up to the office where Uncle Gavin was waiting for the first of the year to start being County Attorney and told him , he sat perfectly still for a good two seconds and then got up already walking . " Show me , " he said . So we went back to where Ratliff was waiting for us . It was a store on the corner by an alley , with a side door on the alley ; the painter was just finishing the curlicue letters on the glass window that saidATELIER MONTYand inside , beyond the glass , Montgomery Ward still wearingthe French cap ( Uncle Gavin said it was a Basque beret ) but in his shirtsleeves . Because we did n't go in then ; Uncle Gavin said , " Come on now . Let him finish it first . " Except Ratliff . He said , " Maybe I can help him . " But Uncle Gavin took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means just a studio , " I said , " why do nt he call it that ? " " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " That 's what I want to know too . " And even though Ratliff went in , he had n't seen anything either . And he sounded just like me . " Studio , " he said . " I wonder why he do nt just call it that ? " " Uncle Gavin did n't know either , " I said . " I know , " Ratliff said . " I was n't asking nobody yet . I was jest kind of looking around for a place to jump . " He looked at me . He blinked two or three times . " Studio , " he said . " That 's right , you ai nt even up that far yet . It 's a photographingstudio . " He blinked again . " But why ? His war record has done already showed he ai nt a feller to be satisfied with no jest dull run-of-the-mill mediocrity like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " But that was all we knew then . Because the next day he had newspapers fastened on the window so you could n't see inside and he kept the door locked and all we ever saw would be the packages he would get out of the post office from Sears and Roebuck in Chicago and unlock the door long enough to take them inside . Then on Thursday when the Clarion came out , almost half of the front page was the announcement of the formal opening , saying Ladies Especially Invited , and at the bottom : Tea . " What ? " I said . " I thought it was going to be a studio . " " It is , " Uncle Gavin said . " You get a cup of tea with it . Only he 's wasting his money . All the women in town andhalf the men will go once just to see why he kept the doorlocked . " Because Mother had already said she was going . " Of course you wont be there , " she told Uncle Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the men then . " He was right . Montgomery Ward had to keep the opening runningall day long to take care of the people that came . He wouldhave had to run it in sections even with the store empty likep122he rented it . But now it would n't have held hardly a dozen at a time , it was so full of stuff , with black curtains hanging all the way to the floor on all the walls that when you drew them back with a kind of pulley it would be like you were looking through a window at outdoors that he said one was the skyline of Paris and another was the Seine river bridges and ks whatever they are and another was the Eiffel Tower and another Notre Dame , and sofas with black pillows and tables with vases and cups and something burning in them that made a sweet kind of smell ; until at first you did n't hardly notice the camera . But finally you did , and a door at the back and Montgomery Ward said , he said it quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to move before he had time to decide that maybe he better not . " That 's the dark room . It 's not open yet . " " I beg pardon ? " Uncle Gavin said . " That 's the dark room , " Montgomery Ward said . " It 's not open yet . " " Are we expected to expect a dark room to be open to the public ? " Uncle Gavin said . But Montgomery Ward was already giving Mrs Rouncewell another cup of tea . Oh yes , there was a vase of flowers too ; in the Clarion announcementof the opening it said Flowers by Rouncewell and I said to Uncle Gavin , where else in Jefferson would anybody get flowers except from Mrs Rouncewell ? and he said she probably paid for half the advertisement , plus a vase containing six overblown roses left over from another funeral , that she will probably take out in trade . Then he said he meant her trade and he hoped he was right . Now he looked at the door a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beginning with tea , " he said . We left then . We had to , to make room . " How can he afford to keep on giving away tea ? " I said . " He wont after today , " Uncle Gavin said . " That was justp123bait , ladies ' bait . Now I 'll ask you one : why did he have to need all the ladies in Jefferson to come in one time and look at his joint ? " And now he sounded just like Ratliff ; he kind of happened to be coming out of the hardware store when we passed . " Had your tea yet ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Tea , " Ratliff said . He did n't ask it . He just said it . He blinked at Uncle Gavin . " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " So do we . The dark room ai nt open yet . " " Ought it to be ? " Ratliff said . " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " So did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratliff said . " Do you even hope so ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Maybe I will hear about it , " Ratliff said . " Do you even hope so ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Maybe somebody else will find out about it and maybe I will be standing where I can hear him , " Ratliff said . And that was all . Montgomery Ward did n't give away any more cups of tea but after a while photographs did begin to appear in the show window , faces that we knew  --  ladies with and without babies and high-school graduating classes and the prettiest girls in their graduation caps and gowns and now and then a couple just married from the country looking a little stiff and uncomfortable and just a little defiant and a narrow white line between his haircut and his sunburn ; and now and then a couple that had been married fifty years that we had known all the time without really realising it until now how much alike they looked , not to mention being surprised , whether at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we begun to realise that not just the same faces but the same photographs of them had been in the same place in the window for over two years now , as if all of a sudden as soon as Montgomery Ward opened his atelier folks stopped graduating and getting married or stayingp124married either , Montgomery Ward was still staying in business , either striking new pictures he did n't put in the windowor maybe just selling copies of the old ones , to pay his rent and stay open . Because he was and maybe it was mostly dark-room work because it was now that we begun to realise that most of his business was at night like he did need darkness , his trade seeming to be mostly men now , the front room where he had had the opening dark now and the customers going and coming through the side door in the alley ; and them the kind of men you would n't hardly think it had ever occurred to them they might ever need to have their picture struck . And his business was spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how people  --  men , the same kind of usually young men that his Jefferson customers were  --  were beginning to come from the next towns around us to leave or pick up their prints and negatives or whatever it was , by that alley door at night . " No no , " Uncle Gavin told Ratliff . " It cant be that . You simply just cant do that in Jefferson . " " There 's folks would a said you could n't a looted a bank in Jefferson too , " Ratliff said . " But she would have to eat , " Uncle Gavin said . " He would have to bring her out now and then for simple air and exercise . " " Out where ? " I said . " Bring who out ? " " It cant be liquor , " Ratliff said . " At least that first suhjestionof yours would a been quiet , which you cant say about peddling whiskey . " " What first suggestion ? " I said . " Bring who out ? " Becauseit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that owned the other half of Ratliff'scafe until Mr Flem Snopes froze him out too . He was the night marshal now. ) had thought of that himself . He came to Uncle Gavin before Uncle Gavin had even thought of sending for him or Mr Buck Connors either , and told Uncle Gavin that he had been spending a good part of thep125nights examining and watching and checking on the studio and he was completely satisfied there was n't any drinking or peddling whiskey or dice-shooting or card-playing going on in Montgomery Ward 's dark room ; that we were all proud of the good name of our town and we all aimed to keep it free of any taint of big-city corruption and misdemeanorand nobody more than him . Until for hours at night when he could have been sitting comfortably in his chair in the police station waiting for the time to make his next round , he would be hanging around that studio withoutonce hearing any suspicion of dice or drinking or any one of Montgomery Ward 's customers to come out smelling or even looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grover Cleveland said , once during the daytime while it was not only his legal right but his duty to his job to be home in bed asleep , just like it was right now while he was giving up his rest to come back to town to make this report to Uncle Gavin as County Attorney , even though he had no warrant , not to mention the fact that by rights this was a job that Buck Connors himself should have done , he  --  Grover Cleveland  --  walked in the front door with the aim of walking right on into the dark room even if he had to break the door to do it since the reason the people of Jefferson appointed him night marshal was to keep down big-city misdemeanor and corruption like gambling and drinking , when to his surprise Montgomery Ward not only did n't try to stop him , he did n't even wait to be asked but instead opened the dark-room door himself and told Grover Cleveland to walk right in and look around . So Grover Cleveland was satisfied , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no drinking or gambling or any other corruption and misdemeanor going on in that back room that would cause the Christian citizens of Jefferson to regret their confidence in appointing him night marshal which was his sworn duty to do even if he did n't take any more pride in Jefferson 's good name thanp126just an ordinary citizen , and any time he could do anything else for Uncle Gavin in the line of his sworn duty , for Uncle Gavin just to mention it . Then he went out , pausing long enough in the door to say : " Howdy , V.K. , " before going on . Then Ratliff came the rest of the way in . " He come hipering across the Square and up the stairs like maybe he had found something , " Ratliff said . " But I reckon not . I do nt reckon Montgomery Ward Snopes would have no more trouble easing him out of that studio than Flem Snopes done easing him out of the rest of our cafe . " " No , " Uncle Gavin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun back then ? " " For fun ? " Ratliff said . Then he said : " Oh . He liked excitement . " " What excitement ? " Uncle Gavin said . " The excitement of talking about it , " Ratliff said . " Of talking about what ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Of talking about excitement , " Ratliff said . He did n't quite look at me . No : he did n't quite not look at me . No , that 's wrong too because even watching him you could n't have said that he had ever stopped looking at Uncle Gavin . He blinked twice . " Female excitement , " he said . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " How ? " " That 's right , " Ratliff said . " How ? " Because I was only eight now , going on nine , and if Uncle Gavin and Ratliff who were three times that and one of them had been all the way to Europe and back and the other had left at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too probably in Yoknapatawpha County did n't know what it was until somebody came and told them , it was n't any wonder that I did n't . There was another what Ratliff called Snopes industry in town now too , though Uncle Gavin refused to call itp127that because he still refused to believe that Eck was ever a Snopes . It was Eck 's boy , Wallstreet Panic , and from the way he began to act as soon as he reached Jefferson and could look around and I reckon find out for the first time in his life that you did n't actually have to act like a Snopes in order to breathe , whether his father was a Snopes or not he sure was n't . Because they said ( he was about twelve when they moved in from Frenchman 's Bend ) how as soon as he got to town and found out about school , he not only made his folks let him go to it but he took his brother , Admiral Dewey , who was n't but six , with him , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers brought the little children who were not big enough yet to stay in one place more than just half a day , with Wallstreet Panic sticking up out of the middle of them like a horse in a duck-pond . Because he was n't ashamed to enter the kindergarten : he was just ashamed to stay in it , not staying in it himself much longer than a half a day because in a week he was in the first grade and by Christmas he was in the second and now Miss Vaiden Wyott who taught the second grade began to help him , telling him what Wallstreet Panic meant and that he did n't have to be named that , so that when she helped him pass the third grade by studying with her the next summer , when he entered the fourth grade that fall his name was just Wall Snopes because she told him that Wall was a good family name in Mississippi with even a general in it and that he did n't even need to keep the Street if he did n't want to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on saying it when people asked him why he wanted to go to school so hard : " I want to learn how to count money , " so that when he heard about it , Uncle Gavin said : " You see ? That proves what I said exactly : no Snopes wants to learn how to count money because he does n't havep128to because you will do that for him  --  or you had damn well better . " He , I mean Wall , was going to need to learn to count it . Even during that first winter while he was making up two grades he had a job . The store next to the Snopes cafe that they lived behind in the tent was a grocery store about the same class as the Snopes cafe . Every morning Wall would get up before schooltime , as the days got shorter he would get up in the dark , to build a fire in the iron stove and sweep out the store and as soon as he got back after school in the afternoon he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally the owner of the store bought him a second-hand bicycle and took the money out of his pay each week . And on Saturdays and holidays he would clerk in the store too , and all that summer while Miss Wyott was helping him pass the third grade ; and even that was n't enough : he got enough recommendations around the Square to get the delivery route for one of the Memphis papers , only by that time he was so busy with his other affairs that he made his brother the paper boy . And the next fall while he was in the fourth grade he managed to get a Jackson paper too and now he had two more boys besides Admiral Dewey working for him , so that by that time any merchant or stock-trader or revival preacher or candidate that wanted handbills put out always went to Wall because he had an organization already set up . He could count money and save it too . So when he was sixteen and that empty oil tank blew his father away and the oil company gave Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out that Mrs Snopes had bought a half interest in the grocery store and Wall had graduated from high school by now and he was a partner in the store . Though he was still the one that got up before daylight on the winter mornings to start the fire and sweep . Then he was nineteen years old and his partner had soldMIMil.lAWW'WAIIIn .4p129the rest of the store to Mrs Snopes and retired , and even if because of Wall 's age the store still could n't be in his name , we knew who it really belonged to , with a hired boy of his own now to come before daylight on the winter mornings to build the fire and sweep . And another one too , except that another Snopes industrywould n't be the right word for this one , because there was n't any profit in it . No , that 's wrong ; we worked at it too hard and Uncle Gavin says that anything people work at as hard as all of us did at this has a profit , is for profit whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not or even want to . The last Snopes they brought into Jefferson did n't quite make it . I mean , this one came just so far , right up to in sight of the town clock in fact , and then refused to go any farther ; even , they said , threatening to go back to Frenchman'sBend , like an old cow or a mule that you finally get right up to the open gate of the pen , but not a step more . He was the old one . Some folks said he was Mr Flem 's father but some said he was just his uncle : a short thick dirty old man with fierce eyes under a tangle of eyebrows and a neck that would begin to swell and turn red before , as Ratliff said , you had barely had time to cross the first word with him . So they bought a little house for him about a mile from town , where he lived with an old-maid daughter and the twin sons named Vardaman and Bilbo that belonged to I.O. Snopes 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number-two wife that was different from the numberoneone that rocked all day long on the front gallery of the Snopes Hotel . The house had a little piece of ground with it that old man Snopes made into a truck garden and watermelon patch . The watermelon patch was the industry . No , that 's wrong . Maybe I mean the industry took place because ofp130the watermelon patch . Because it was like the old man did n't really raise the watermelons to sell or even just to be eaten , but as a bait for the pleasure or sport or contest or maybe just getting that mad , of catching boys robbing it ; planting and cultivating and growing watermelons just so he could sit ambushed with a loaded shotgun behind a morning-gloryvine on his back gallery until he could hear sounds from the melon patch and then shooting at it . Then one moonlight night he could see enough too and this time he actually shot John Wesley Roebuck with a load of squirrel shot , and the next morning Mr Hub Hampton , the sheriff , rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again let that shotgun off he would come back and take it away from him and throw him in jail to boot . So after that , old Snopes did n't dare use the gun . All he could do now was to stash away piles of rocks at different places along the fence , and just sit behind the vine with a heavy stick and a flashlight . That was how the industry started . Mr Hampton had passed the word around town to all the mothers and fathers to tell their sons to stay out of that damned patch now ; that any time they wanted a watermelon that bad , he , Mr Hampton , would buy them one , because if they kept on making old man Snopes that mad , some day he would burst a blood vessel and die and we would all be in jail . But old Snopes did n't know that because Vardaman and Bilbo did n't tell him . They would wait until he was in the house , lying down maybe to take a nap after dinner , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some boys were in the patch , and he would jump up yelling and cursing and grab up the oak cudgel and go tearing out to the patch , and nobody in it or near it except Vardaman and Bilbo behind the corner of the house dying laughing , then dodging and running and still laughing while the old man scrabbled up his piled rocks to throw at them . Because he never would catch on . No , that 's wrong too : he always caught on . The trouble was , he did n't dare riskp131doing nothing when they would run in hollering " Grampaw ! Grampaw ! Chaps in the melon patch ! " because it might be true . He would have to jump up and grab the stick and run out , knowing beforehand he probably would n't find anybody there except Vardaman and Bilbo behind the corner of the house that he could n't even catch , throwing the rocks and cursing them until he would give out of rocks and breath both , then standing there gasping and panting with his neck as red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curse louder than whispering . That 's what we  --  all the boys in Jefferson between six and twelve years old and sometimes even older  --  would go out there to hide behind the fence and watch . We never had seen anybody bust a blood vessel and die and we wanted to be there when it happened to see what it would look like . This was after Uncle Gavin finally got home from rehabilitatingEurope . We were crossing the Square when she passed us . I never could tell if she had looked at Uncle Gavin , though I know she never looked at me , let alone spoke when we passed . But then , that was all right ; I did n't expect her either to or not to ; sometimes she would speak to me but sometimes she never spoke to anybody and we were used to it . Like she did this time : just walking on past us exactly like a pointer dog walks just before it freezes onto the birds . Then I saw that Uncle Gavin had stopped and turned to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away since 1914 which was eight years ago now , so she was only about five or six when he saw her last . " Who is that ? " he said . " Linda Snopes , " I said . " You know : Mr Flem Snopes 's girl . " And I was still watching her too . " She walks like a pointer , " I said . " I mean , a pointer that 's just " I know what you mean , " Uncle Gavin said . " I know exactly what you mean . "  |p132I  knew exactly what he meant . She was walking steadily toward us , completely aware of us , yet not once had she looked at either of us , the eyes not hard and fixed so much as intent , oblivious ; fixed and unblinking on something past us , beyond us , behind us , as a young pointer will walk over you if you do nt move out of the way , during the last few yards before the actual point , since now it no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually looking at the huddled trigger-set covey . She went past us still walking , striding , like the young pointer bitch , the maiden bitch of course , the virgin bitch , immune now in virginity , not scorning the earth , spurning the earth , because she needed it to walk on in that immunity : just intent from earth and us too , not proud and not really oblivious : just immune in intensity and ignorance and innocence as the sleepwalker is for the moment immune from the anguishes and agonies of breath . She would be thirteen , maybe fourteen now and the reason I did not know her and would not have known her was not because I had possibly not seen her in eight years and human females change so drastically in the years betweenten and fifteen . It was because of her mother . It was as though I  --  you too perhaps  --  could not have believed but that a woman like that must , could not other than , produce an exact replica of herself . That Eula Varner  --  You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had  --  had had to  --  watched them in bed together . Eula Snopes it could never be simply because it must not simply because I would decline to have it so  --  that Eula Varner owed that much at least to the simple male hunger which she blazed into anguish just by being , existing , breathing ; having been born , becoming born , becoming a part of Motion  --  that hunger which she herself could never assuage since therep133was but one of her to match with all that hungering . And that single one doomed to fade ; by the fact of that mortality doomed not to assuage nor even negate the hunger ; doomed never to efface the anguish and the hunger from Motion even by her own act of quitting Motion and so fill with her own absence from it the aching void where once had glared that incandescent shape . That 's what you thought at first , of course : that she must of necessity repeat herself , duplicate herself if she reproducedat all . Because immediately afterward you realised that obviously she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit that to occur , permit two of them in a place no larger than Jefferson , Mississippi , in one century , let alone in overlapping succession , within the anguished scope of a single generation . Because even Nature , loving concupiscent uproar and excitement as even Nature loves it , insists that it at least be reproductive of fresh fodder for the uproar and the excitement . Which would take time , the time necessary to produce that new crop of fodder , since she  --  Eula Varner  --  had exhausted , consumed , burned up that one of hers . Whereupon I would remember what Maggie said once to Gowan back there in the dead long time ago when I was in the throes of my own apprenticeship to holocaust : " You do nt marry Helen and Semiramis ; you just commit suicide for her . " Because she  --  the child  --  did n't look at all like her mother . And then in that same second I knew exactly whom she did resemble . Back there in that time of my own clowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I remember how I could never decide which of the two unbearables was the least unbearable ; which ( as the poet has it ) of the two chewed bitter thumbs was the least bitter for chewing . That is , whether Manfred de Spain had seduced a chaste wife , or had simply been caught up in passing by a rotating nympholept . This was my anguish . If the first was right , what qualities of mere man did Man/fred have that I did n't ? If the second , what blind outrageous fortune 's lightning-bolt was it that struck Manfred de Spain that might n't , should n't , could n't , anyway did n't , have blasted Gavin Stevens just as well ? Or even also ( oh yes , it was that bad once , that comical once ) I would even have shared her if I had to , could n't have had her any other way . That was when ( I mean the thinking why it had n't been me in Manfred 's place to check that glance 's idle fateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say that she must be chaste , a wife true and impeachless . I would think It 's that damned child , that damned baby  --  that innocent infant which , simply by innocently being , breathing , existing , lacerated and scoriated and reft me of peace : if there had only been no question of the child 's paternity ; or better still , no child at all . Thus I would even get a little relief from my chewed thumbs since I would need both of them for the moment to count with . Ratliff had told me how they departed for Texas immediately after the wedding and when they returned twelve months later , the child was already walking . Which ( the walking at least ) I did not believe , not because of the anguish , the jealousy , the despair , but simply because of Ratliff . In fact , it was Ratliff who gave me that ease of hope  --  or if you like , ease from anguish ; all right : tears too , peaceful tears but tears , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pant with . Because even if the child had been only one day old , Ratliff would have invented the walking , being Ratliff . In fact , if there had been no child at all yet , Ratliff would have invented one , invented one already walking for the simple sake of his own paradox and humor , secured as he was from checkable facts by this much miles and time between Frenchman 's Bend and Jefferson two years later . That was when I would rather believe it was Flem 's own child ; rather defilement by Manfredde Spain than promiscuity by Eula Varner  --  where/upon I would need only to taste that thumb again to realise that any other thumb was less bitter , no matter which : let her accept the whole earth 's Manfred de Spains and refuse Gavin Stevens , than to accept one Flem Snopes and still refuse him . So you see how much effort a man will make and trouble he will invent to guard and defend himself from the boredomof peace of mind . Or rather perhaps the pervert who deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of being rid of them again , since even in the folly of youth we know that nothing lasts ; but because even in that folly we are afraid that maybe Nothing will last , that maybe Nothing will last forever , and anything is better than Nothing , even lice . So now , as another poet sings , That Fancy passed me by And nothing will remain ; which , praise the gods , is a damned lie since , praise , 0 gods ! Nothing can not remain anywhere since nothing is vacuum and vacuum is paradox and unbearable and we will have none of it even if we would , the damned-fool poet 's Nothingsteadily and perennially full of perennially new and perennially renewed anguishes for me to measure my stature against whenever I need reassure myself that I also am Motion . Because the second premise was much better . If I was not to have her , then Flem Snopes shall never have . So instead of the poet 's Fancy passes by And nothing remaining , it is Remaining which will always remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So no matter how much more the blood will slow and remembering grow more lascerant , the blood at least will always remember that once it was that capable , capable at least of anguish . So that girl-child was not Flem Snopes 's at all , but mine ; my child and my grandchild both , since the McCarron boy who begot her ( oh yes , I can even believe Ratliff when it suits me ) in that lost time , was Gavin Stevens in that lost time ; and , since remaining must remain or quit being remaining ,  |p136Gavin  Stevens is fixed by his own child forever at that one age in that one moment . So since the son is father to the man , the McCarron fixed forever and timeless in that dead youth as Gavin Stevens is of necessity now the son of Gavin Stevens 's age , and McCarron 's child is Gavin Stevens'sgrandchild . Whether Gavin Stevens intended to be that father-grandfatheror not , of course . But then neither did he dream that that one idle glance of Eula Varner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would confer on him foster-uncleship over every damned Snopes wanting to claim it out of that whole entire damned connection she married into . I mean foster-uncleship in the sense that simple enragement and outrage and obsession per se take care of their own just as simple per se poverty and ( so they say ) virtue do of theirs . But foster-uncleship only to he : never she . So this was not the first time I ever thought how apparently all Snopeses are male , as if the mere and simple incident of woman 's divinity precluded Snopesishness and made it paradox . No : it was rather as if Snopes were some profoundand incontrovertible hermaphroditic principle for the furtherance of a race , a species , the principle vested always physically in the male , any anonymous conceptive or gestative organ drawn into that radius to conceive and spawn , repeating that male principle and then vanishing ; the Snopes female incapable of producing a Snopes and hence harmless like the malaria-bearing mosquito of whom only the female is armed and potent , turned upside down and backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divine one : the unsleeping hand of God Himself , unflaggingand constant , else before now they would have owned the whole earth , let alone just Jefferson , Mississippi . Because now Flem Snopes was vice president of what we still called Colonel Sartoris 's bank . Oh yes , our banks have vice presidents the same as anybody else 's bank . Only nobody in Jefferson ever paid any attention to just the vicep 137president of a bank before ; he  --  a bank vice president  --  was like someone who had gained the privilege of calling himself major or colonel by having contributed time or money or influence to getting a governor elected , as compared to him who had rightfully inherited his title from a father or grandfather who had actually ridden a horse at a Yankee soldier , like Manfred de Spain or our Colonel Sartoris . So Flem was the first actual living vice president of a bank we had ever seen to notice . We heard he had fallen heir to the vice presidency when Manfred de Spain moved up his notch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds and ends which ( we now learned ) Flem himself had been picking up here and there for some time , plus Manfred de Spain himself . Which was all right ; it was done now ; too late to help ; we were used to our own Jefferson breed or strain of bank vice presidents and we expected no more of even a Snopes bank vice president than simple conformation to pattern . Then to our surprise we saw that he was trying to be what he  --  a Snopes or anyway a Flem Snopes  --  thought a bank vice president was or should be . He began to spend most of the day in the bank . Not in the back office where Colonel Sartoris had used to sit and where Manfred de Spain now sat , but in the lobby , standing a little back from the window watching the clients coming and going to leave their money or draw it out , still in that little cloth cap and the snap-on-behind bow tie he had come to town in thirteen years ago and his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something though I anyway in my part of those thirteen years had never seen him spit . Then one day we saw him at his post in the lobby and we did n't even know him . He was standing where he always stood , back where he would be out of the actual path to the window but where he could still watch it ( watching how much money was going in or how much was coming out , we did n't know which ; whether perhaps what held himp138thralled there was the simply solvency of the bank which in a way  --  by deputy , by proxy  --  was now his bank , his pride : that no matter how much money people drew out of it , there was always that one who had just deposited that zero-plus-one dollar into it in time ; or whether he actually did believe in an inevitable moment when De Spain or whoever the designated job would belong to , would come to the window from the inside and say " Sorry , folks , you cant draw out any more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Flem  --  simply wanted to prove to himself that he was wrong ) . But this time we did n't know him . He still wore the little bow tie and his jaw was still pulsing faintly and steadily , but now he wore a hat , a new one of the broad black felt kind which country preachers and politicians wore . And the next day he was actually inside the cage where the money actually was and where the steel door opened into the concrete vault where it stayed at night ; and now we realised that he was not watching the money any longer ; he had learned all there was to learn about that . Now he was watching the records of it , how they kept the books . And now we  --  some of us , a few of us  --  believed that he was preparing himself to show his nephew or cousin Byron how to really loot a bank . But Ratliff ( naturally it was Ratliff ) stopped that quick . " No no , " he said , " he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of money as to let a feller no brighter than Byron Snopes steal some of it . You boys have got Flem Snopes wrong . He 's got too much respect and reverence not jest for money , but for sharpness too , to outrage and debase one of them by jest crude robbing and stealing the other one . " And as the days followed , he  --  Snopes  --  had his coat off too , in his galluses now like he actually worked there , was paid money every Saturday to stay inside the cage , except that he still wore the new hat , standing now rightp139behind the book-keepers while he found out for himself how a bank was run . And now we heard how always when people came in to pay off notes or the interest on them , and sometimes when they came to borrow the money too ( except the old short-tempered ones , old customers from back in Colonel Sartoris 's time , who would run Flem out of the back room without waiting for De Spain to do it or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he there too , his jaw still faintly pulsing while he watched and learned ; that was when Ratliff said that all he  --  Snopes  --  needed to learn now was how to write out a note so that the fellow borrowing the money could n't even read when it was due , let alone the rate of interest , like Colonel Sartoris could write one ( the tale , the legend was that once the colonel wrote out a note for a country-man customer , a farmer , who took the note and looked at it , then turned it upside down and looked at it , then handed it back to the colonel and said , " What does it say , Colonel ? I cant read it , " whereupon the colonel took it in his turn , looked at it , turned it upside down and looked at it , then tore it in two and threw it in the waste basket and said , " Be damned if I can either , Tom . We 'll try another one . " ) , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about banking in Jefferson , and could graduate . Evidently he learned that too . One day he was not in the bank any more , and the day after that , and the day after that . On the day the bank first opened about twenty years ago Mrs Jennie Du Pre , Colonel Sartoris 's sister , had put a tremendous great rubber plant in the corner of the lobby . It was taller than a man , it took up as much room as a privy ; it was in everybody 's way and in summer they could n't even open the front door all the way back because of it . But she would n't let the colonel nor the board of directors either remove it , since she belonged to that school which believed that any room inhabited by people had to have something green in it to absorb the poison from thep140air . Though why it had to be that monstrous rubber plant , nobody knew , unless perhaps she believed that nothing less than rubber and that much of it would be tough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anxiety or exultation over as much money as her brother 's , a Sartoris , old Colonel Sartoris 's son 's bank would naturally handle . So when the days passed and Snopes was no longer to be seen taking up room in the lobby while he watched the borrowing and the lending and the paying in and the drawingout ( or who did each , and how much of each , which according to Ratliff was the real reason he was there , was what he was really watching ) , it was as if Mrs Du Pre 's rubber tree had vanished from the lobby , abandoned it . And when still more days passed and we finally realised he was not coming back any more , it was like hearing that the rubber tree had been hauled away somewhere and burned , destroyed forever . It was as if the single aim and purpose of that long series of interlocked circumstances  --  the bank which a sentimentalist like Colonel Sartoris founded in order that , as Ratliff said , a feller no brighter than Byron Snopes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove too fast for our country roads ( the Jefferson ladies said because he was grieving so over the death in battle of his twin brother that he too was seeking death though in my opinion Bayard liked war and now that there was no more war to go to , he was faced with the horrid prospect of having to go to work ) until his grandfathertook to riding with him in the hope that he would slow down : as a result of which , the normal check-up of the bank for re-organization revealed the fact that Byron Snopes had been robbing it : as a result of which , to save the good name of the bank which his father had helped to found , Manfred de Spain had to allow Flem Snopes to become vice president of it  --  the single result of all this apparently was to efface that checked cap from Flemp141Snopes and put that hot-looking black politician-preacher 's hat on him in its stead . Because he still wore the hat . We saw that about the Square every day . But never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was not only a director but in whose hierarchy he had an official designated place , second-incommand . Not even to deposit his own money in it . Oh yes , we knew that ; we had Ratliff 's word for that . Ratliff had to know a fact like that by now . After this many years of working to establish and maintain himself as what he uniquely was in Jefferson , Ratliff could not afford , he did not dare , to walk the streets and not have the answer to any and every situation which was not really any of his business . Ratliff knew : that not only was Flem Snopes no longer a customer of the bank of which he was vice president , but that in the second year he had transferred his account to the other , rival bank , the old bank of Jefferson . So we all knew the answer to that . I mean , we had been right all along . All except Ratliff of course , who had dissuadedus before against our mutually combined judgments . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he taught himself the intricacies of banking in order to plumb laboriously the crude and awkward method by which his cousin or nephew Byron had made his petty and unambitioushaul ; we had seen him in and out of the vault itself while he learned the tide-cycle , the rise and fall of the actual cash against the moment when it would be most worth pillaging ; we believed now that when that moment came , Flem would have already arranged himself for his profit to be one hundred percent , that he himself was seeingto it in advance that he would not have to steal even one forgotten penny of his own money . " No , " Ratliff said . " No . " " In which case , he will defeat himself , " I said . " What does he expect to happen when the other depositors , especially the ignorant ones that know too little about banksp142and the smart ones that know too much about Snopeses , begin to find out that the vice president of the bank does n't even keep his own loose change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ratliff said . " You folks  --  " " So he 's hoping  --  wishing  --  dreaming of starting a run on his own bank , not to loot it but to empty it , abolish it . All right . Why ? For revenge on Manfred de Spain because of his wife ? " " No no , I tell you ! " Ratliff said . " I tell you , you got Flem all wrong , all of you have . I tell you , he ai nt just got respect for money : he 's got active " ( he always said active for actual , though in this case I believe his choice was better than Webster 's ) " reverence for it . The last thing he would ever do is hurt that bank . Because any bank whether it 's hisn or not stands for money , and the last thing he would ever do is to insult and degrade money by mishandling it . Likely the one and only thing in his life he is ashamed of is the one thing he wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likely he wakes up at night right now and writhes and squirms over it . Not because he lost by it because do nt nobody know yet , nor never will , whether he actively lost or not because do nt nobody know yet jest how much of that old brass he might a sold before he made the mistake of trying to do it wholesale by using Tom Tom Bird and Tomey Beauchamp . He 's ashamed because when he made money that-a-way , he got his-self right down into the dirt with the folks that waste money because they stole it in the first place and ai nt got nowhere to put it down where they can risk turning their backs on it . " " Then what is he up to ? " I said . " What is he trying to do ? " " I do n't know , " Ratliff said . And now he not only did n't sound like Ratliff , answering he did n't know to any question , he did n't even look like Ratliff : the customary bland smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly sober . " I jest do nt know.  |p143We  got to figger . That 's why I come up here to see you : in case you did know . Hoping you knowed . " Then he was Ratliff again , humorous , quizzical , invincibly . . . maybe the word I want is not optimism or courage or even hope , but rather of sanity or maybe even of innocence . " But naturallyyou do nt know neither . Confound it , the trouble is we do nt never know beforehand , to anticipate him . It 's like a rabbit or maybe a bigger varmint , one with more poison or anyhow more teeth , in a patch or a brake : you can watch the bushes shaking but you cant see what it is or which-awayit 's going until it breaks out . But you can sec it then , and usually it 's in time . Of course you got to move fast when he does break out , and he 's got the advantage of you because he 's already moving because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving yet because you do nt . But it 's usually in time . " That was the first time the bushes shook . The next time was almost a year later ; he came in , he said " Good morning , Lawyer , " and he was Ratliff again , bland , smooth , courteous , a little too damned intelligent . " I figgered you might like to hear the latest news first , being as you 're a member of the family too by simple bad luck and exposure , you might say . Being as so far do nt nobody know about it except the directors of the Bank of Jefferson . " " The Bank of Jefferson ? " I said . " That 's right . It 's that non-Snopes boy of Eck 's , that other non-Snopes that blowed his-self up in that empty oil tank back while you was away at the war , wasting his time jest hunting a lost child that was n't even lost , jest his maw thought he was  --  " " Yes , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that : the non-Snopes son of a non-Snopes who had had the good fortune to discover ( or be discovered by ) a good woman early in life : the second-grade teacher who , obviously recognising that un-Snopes anomaly , not only told him what Wallstreet Panic meant , but that he didn'tp144really have to have it for his name if he did n't want to ; but if he thought a too-violent change might be too much , then he could call himself simply Wall Snopes since Wall was a good name , having been carried bravely by a brave Mississippi general at Chickamauga and Lookout Mountain , and though she did n't think that , being a non-Snopes , he would particularly need to remember courage , remembering courage never hurt anyone . And how he had taken the indemnity money the oil company paid for his father 's bizarre and needless and un-Snopesish death and bought into the little back-street grocery store where he had been the **30;10421;TOOLONG and errand boy , and continued to save his money until , when the old owner died at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he got married who was never a Snopes , never in this world a Snopes : doomed damned corruptedand self-convicted not merely of generosity but of taste ; holding simple foolish innocent rewardless generosity , not to mention taste , even higher than his own repute when the town should learn he had actually proposed marriage to a woman ten years his senior . That 's what he did , not even waiting to graduate  --  the day , the moment when in the hot stiff brand-new serge suit , to walk sweating through the soundless agony of the cut flowers , across the high-school rostrum and receive his diploma from the hand of the principal  --  but only for the day when he knew he was done with the school , forever more beyond the range of its help or harm ( he was nineteen . Seven years ago he and his six-year-old brother had entered the same kindergarten class . In this last year his grades had been such that they did n't even ask him to take the examinations. )  --  to leave the store of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time to be standing at the corner when the dismissal bell rang , standing there while the kindergarten then the first-grade children streamed past him , then the second grade , standing therep145while the Lilliputian flow divided around them like a brook around two herons , while without even attempting to touch her in this all juvenile Jefferson 's sight , he proposed to the second-grade teacher and then saw her , as another teacher did from a distance , stare at him and partly raise one defending hand and then burst into tears , right then in plain view of the hundred children who at one time within the last three or four years had been second-graders too , to whom she had been mentor , authority , infallible . Until he could lead her aside , onto the vacating playground , himself to screen her while she used his handkerchief to regain composure , then , against all the rules of the school and of respectable decorum too , back into the empty room itself smelling of chalk and anguished cerebration and the dry inflexibility of facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss , not to let him touch her even and least of all to remind him that she had already been twenty-two years old that day seven years ago and that twelve months from now he would discover that all Jeffersonhad been one year laughing at him . Who had been divinitive enough to see seven years beyond that wallstreet panic , but was more , much more than that : a lady , the tears effaced now and she once more the Miss Wyott , or rather the " Miss Vaiden " as Southern children called their teacher , telling him , feeding him none of those sorry reasons : saying simply that she was already engaged and some day she wanted him to know her fiance because she knew they would be friends . So that he would not know better until he was much older and had much more sense . Nor learning it then when it was too late because it was not too late , since did n't I just say that she was wise , more than just wise : divinitive ? Also , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own branch of it remained there where they had owned the nearest ford , crossing , ferry before Jefferson even became Jefferson ) so without doubt she even knew in advance thep146girl , which girl even , since she seems to have taken him directly there , within the week , almost as though she said " This is she . Marry her " and within the month he did n't even know probably that he had not remarked that Miss Vaiden Wyott had resigned from the Jefferson school where she had taught the second grade for a decade , to accept a position in a school in Bristol , Virginia , since when that fall day came he was two months husband to a tense fierce not quite plain-faced girl with an ambition equal to his and a will if anything even more furious against that morass , that swamp , that fetid seethe from which her husband ( she naturally believed ) had extricated himself by his own suspendersand boot straps , herself clerking in the store now so that the mother-in-law could now stay at home and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she did n't weigh quite a hundred pounds , doing the apprenticechores  --  sweeping , wrestling the barrels of flour and molasses , making the rounds of the town on the bicycle in which the telephone orders were delivered until they could afford to buy the second-hand Model T Ford  --  during the hours while the younger one , Admiral Dewey , was in school where it was she now , his sister-in-law , who made him go whether he would or not . Yes , we all knew that ; that was a part of our folklore , or Snopeslore , if you like : how Flem himself was anyway the second one to see that here was a young man who was going to make money by simple honesty and industry , and tried to buy into the business or anyway lend Wallstreet money to expand it ; and we all knew who had refused the offer . That is , we liked to believe , having come to know Wallstreet a little now , that he would have declined anyway . But since we had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decline . And how he had learned to be a clerk and a partner the hard way , and he would have to learn to be a proprietor the hard way too : and sure enoughp147in time he overbought his stock ; and how he went to Colonel Sartoris 's bank for help . That was when we first realised that Flem Snopes actually was a member of the board of directors of a Jefferson bank . I mean , that a Flem Snopes actually could be . Oh , we had seen his name among the others on the annual bank report above the facsimile of Colonel Sartoris 's illegible signature as president , but we merely drew the logical conclusion that that was simply old man Will Varner 's voting proxy to save him a trip to town ; all we thought was , " That means that Manfred de Spain will have Uncle Billy 's stock too in case he ever wants anything . " And obviously we knew , believed , that Flem had tried again to buy into Wallstreet 's business , save him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked the loan from the bank . Because we thought we saw it all now ; all we seemed to have missed was , what hold he could have had over the drummer to compel him to persuade Wallstreet to overbuy , and over the wholesale house in St. Louis to persuade it to accept the sale  --  very likely the same sign or hoodoo-mark he planned to use on the other bank , the Bank of Jefferson , to prevent them lending Wallstreet money after Colonel Sartoris 's bank declined . But there was never any question about which one of the Wallstreet Snopeses had turned Flem down . Anybody could have seen her that morning , running , thin , not so much tense as fierce , still weighing less than a hundred pounds , even after six months of marriage looking still not so much like a nymph as like a deer , not around the Square as pedestrians walked but across it , through it , darting among the automobiles and teams and wagons , toward and into the bank ( and how she knew , divined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know either , though on second thought that was obvious too : that simple automaticfierce Snopes antipathy which had reacted as soon as common sense told her it should not have taken the bankp148that long to say Yes , and that Flem Snopes was on the board of directors of it )  --  darting into the lobby already crying : " Where is he ? Where is Wall ? " and out again when they told her Gone , not at all desperate : just fierce and hurried , onto the street where someone else told her he went that way : which was the street leading to the back street leading to the rented house where Flem lived , who had no office nor other place of business , running now until she overtook him , in time . And anyone there could have seen that too : clinging to him in broad daylight when even sweethearts did n't embrace on the street by daylight and no lady anywhere at any time said God damn in public , crying ( weeping too but no tears , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as they emerged onto it ) : " Do nt you dare ! Them damn Snopes ! God damn them ! God damn them ! " So we thought of course that her father , a small though thrifty farmer , had found the money somehow . Because Wallstreet saved his business . And he had not only learned about solvency from that experience , he had learned something more about success too . In another year he had rented ( then bought it ) the store next door and converted it into a warehouse , stock room , so he could buy in larger wholesalelots for less money ; another few years and he had rented what had been the last livery stable in Jefferson for his warehouse and knocked down the wall between the two stores and now he had in Jefferson the first self-service grocery store we had ever seen , built on the pattern which the big chain grocery stores were to make nationwide in the purveying of food ; the street his store faced on made an L with the alley where the old Snopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed his first night in Jefferson was directly behind his store too ; he either bought or rented that lot ( there were more automobiles in Jeffersonnow ) and made a parking lot and so taught the house/wives of Jefferson to come to town and seek his bargains and carry them home themselves . That is , we  --  or that is , I  --  thought that it was his fatherin-lawwho had found the money to save him , until now . " Well , I 'll be damned , " I said . " So it was you . " " That 's right , " Ratliff said . " All I wanted was jest a note for it . But he insisted on making me a partner . And I 'll tell you something else we 're fixing to do . We 're fixing to open a wholesale . " " A what ? " I said . " A wholesale company like the big ones in St. Louis , right here in Jefferson , so that instead of either having to pay high freight on a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perishable to save freight , a merchant anywhere in the county can buy jest what he needs at a decent price without having to add no freight a-tall . " " Well I 'll be damned , " I said . " Why did n't you think of that yourself years ago ? " " That 's right , " Ratliff said . " Why did n't you ? " " Well I 'll be damned , " I still said . Then I said : " Hell fire , are you still selling stock ? Can I get in ? " " Why not ? " he said . " Long as your name ai nt Snopes . Maybe you could even buy some from him if your name was n't jest Flem Snopes . But you got to pass that-ere little gal first . His wife . You ought to stop in there sometime and hear her say Them goddamn Snopes once . Oh sho , all of us have thought that , and some of us have even said it out loud . But she 's different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let him change neither . " " Yes , " I said . " I 've heard about that . I wonder why she never changed their name . " " No no , " he said . " You do nt understand . She do nt want to change it . She jest wants to live it down . She ai nt trying to drag him by the hair out of Snopes , to escape from Snopes . She 's got to purify Snopes itself . She 's got to beatp150Snopes from the inside . Stop in there and listen sometimes . " " A wholesale house , " I said . " So that 's why Flem  --  " But that was foolish , as Ratliff himself saw even before I said it. "  --  why Flem changed his account from his own bank to the other one ? No no . We ai nt using the banks here . We do nt need them . Like Flem was the first feller in Jeffersonto find out that . Wall 's credit is too good with the big wholesalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ai nt cutting into nobody 's private business : he 's helping all business . We do nt need no bank . But we  --  he  --  still aims to keep it homemade . So you see him if you want to talk about stock . " " I will , " I said . " But what is Flem himself up to ? Why did he pull his money out of De Spain 's bank as soon as he got to be vice president of it ? Because he 's still that , so he still owns stock in it . But he does n't keep his own money in it . Why ? " " Oh , " he said , " is that what you 're worried about ? Why , we ai nt sho yet . All we 're doing now is watching the bushes shake . " Between the voice and the face there were always two Ratliffs : the second one offering you a fair and open chance to divine what the first one really meant by what it was saying , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratliff was trying to tell me something which forwhatever reason the other could not say in words . " As long as that little gal lives , Flem ai nt got no chance to ever get a finger-hold on Wall . So Eck Snopes is out . And I.O. Snopes never was in because I.O. never was worth nothing even to I.O. , let alone for anybody else to take a cut of the profit . So that jest about exhausts all the Snopeses in reach that a earnest hardworking feller might make a forced share-crop on . " " There 's that  --  " I said . " All right , " he said . " I 'll say it for you . Montgomery Ward . The photograph gallery . If Flem ai nt been in thatp151thing all the time from the very first , he do nt never aim to be . And the fact that there ai nt been a new photograph in his show window in over a year now , let alone Jason Compson collecting his maw 's rent prompt on time since the second month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flem seen from the first day that there was n't nothing there for him to waste his time on . So I cant think of but one Snopes object that he 's got left . " " All right , " I said . " I 'll bite . " " That-ere twenty-dollar gold piece . " " What twenty-dollar gold piece ? " " Do nt you remember what I said that day , about how when a country boy makes his first Sad-dy night trip to Memphis , that-ere twenty-dollar bill he wears pinned inside his undershirt so he can at least get back home ? " " Go on , " I said . " You cant stop now . " " What 's the one thing in Jefferson that Flem ai nt got yet ? The one thing he might want . That maybe he 's been working at ever since they taken Colonel Sartoris out of that wrecked car and he voted Uncle Billy Varner 's stock to make Manfred de Spain president of that bank ? " " To be president of it himself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It cant be ! It must not be ! " But he was just watching me . " Nonsense , " I said . " Why nonsense ? " he said . " Because , to use what you call that twenty-dollar gold piece , he 's got to use his wife too . Do you mean to tell me you believe for one moment that his wife will side with him against Manfred de Spain ? " But still he just looked at me . " Do nt you agree ? " I said . " How can he hope for that ? " Yes , he was just looking at me . " That would jest be when he finally runs out of the bushes , " he said . " Out to where we can see him . Into the clearing . What 's that clear-ing ? " " Clearing ? " I said . " That he was working toward ?  --  All right , " he said.  | " That druv him to burrow through the bushes to get out of them ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What else does he need ? want ? What else has ever driven him ? " But he just looked at me , and now I could actually watch that urgency fade until only the familiar face remained , bland , smooth , impenetrable and courteous . He drew out the dollar watch looped on a knotted shoelace between his button hole and his breast pocket . " I be dog if it ai nt almost dinner time , " he said . " Jest about time to walk to it . "  |p153Because  he missed it . He missed it completely.  |p154They  finally caught Montgomery Ward Snopes . I mean , they caught Grover Cleveland Winbush . Like Ratliff said , anybody bootlegging anything that never had any more sense than to sell Grover Cleveland Winbush some of it deserved to be caught . Except Uncle Gavin said that , even without Grover Cleveland , Montgomery Ward was bound to be caught sooner or later , since there simply was n't any place in Jefferson , Mississippi , culture for a vocation or hobby or interest like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes ; and maybe among the metropolitan rich or bohemians , yes too . But not in a land composed mainly of rural Baptists . So they caught Grover Cleveland . It was one night , not very late . I mean , the stores were all closed but folks were still going home from the second running of the picture show ; and some of them , I reckon anybody that passed and happened to look inside , saw the two fellows inside Uncle Willy Christian 's drugstore working at the prescription case where Uncle Willy kept the medicines ; and even though they were strangers  --  that is , nobody passing recognised them  --  the ones that looked in and saw them said the next day that they never thought anything of it , being that early and the lights on and Grover Cleveland not having anything to do as night marshal except to walk around the Square and look in the windows , that sooner or later he would have to see them if they never had any business there . So it was n't until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found out somebody had unlocked the store and not only unlocked the safe and took what money he had in it , they had broke open his pharmacy cabinet and stole all his morphine and sleeping pills . That 's what caused the trouble . Ratliff said they could have takenp155the money or for that matter all the rest of the store too except that prescription case , including the alcohol , because Walter Christian , the Negro janitor , had been taking the alcohol , a drink at a time ever since he and Uncle Willy both were boys and first started in the store , and Uncle Willy would have cussed and stomped around of course and even had the Law in , but that was all . But whoever touched that prescription cabinet with the morphine in it raised the devil himself . Uncle Willy was a bachelor , about sixty years old , and if you came in at the wrong time of day he even snarled at children too . But if you were careful to remember the right time of day he supplied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game he would give the whole teams ice cream free whether they won or not . I mean , until one summer some of the church ladies decided to reform him . After that it was hard to tell when to speak to him or not . Then the ladies would give up for a while and it would be all right again . Besides that , the federal drug inspectors had been naggingand worrying at him for years about keeping the morphine in that little flimsy wooden drawer that anybody with a screw-driver or a knife blade or maybe just a hair pin could prize open , even though it did have a key to it that Uncle Willy kept hidden under a gallon jug marked Nux Vomica on a dark shelf that nobody but him was even supposed to bother because it was so dark back there that even Walter never went back there since Uncle Willy could n't have seen whether he had swept there or not even if he had ; and each time Uncle Willy would have to promise the inspectors to lock the morphine up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to have more trouble than ever explaining to the inspectors why he had n't put the morphine in the safe like he promised ; reminding them how , even if he had , the robbers would still have got it was n't going to do any good now because , like Ratliff said , federal folksp156were not interested in whether anything worked or not , all they were interested in was that you did it exactly like their rules said to do it . So Uncle Willy was the real cause of them catching Montgomery Ward Snopes . He was good and wild at first . He was so wild for a while that nobody could find out how much had been stolen or even what he was talking about , with more folks coming in from the street not so much to see where the robbery was but to watch Uncle Willy ; until finally , it was Ratliff , of course , said : " Uncle Willy do nt need no sheriff yet . What he needs first is Doc Peabody . " " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it always have to be you ? " He went back to where Skeets McGowan , Uncle Willy 's clerk and soda-jerker , and two other boys were standing with their heads inside the open safe looking at where the money had been stolen from , and pulled Skeets out and told him to run upstairs quick and tell Doctor Peabody to hurry down . Then Uncle Gavin and the others kind of crowded Uncle Willy more or less quiet without actually holding him until Doctor Peabody came in with the needle already in his hand even and ran most of them out and rolled up Uncle Willy 's sleeve then rolled it back down again and then Uncle Willy settled down into being just mad . So he was the one responsible for catching Montgomery Ward . Or the two fellows that stole his morphine were . By this time we knew that several people passing from the picture show had seen the two fellows in the store , and now Uncle Willy wanted to know where Grover Cleveland Winbushwas all that time . Yes sir , he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steady and deadly about it as a horsefly . By that time , nine oclock in the morning , Grover Cleveland would be at home in bed asleep . Somebody said they would telephone out and wake him up and tell him to get on back to the Square fast as he could . " Hell , " Uncle Willy said . " That 'll take too long . I 'll gop157out there myself . I 'll wake him up and get him back to town . He wont need to worry about quick because I 'll tend to that . Who 's got a car ? " Only Mr Buck Connors , the marshal , the chief of police , was there by this time . " Hold up now , Uncle Willy , " he said . " There 's a right way and a wrong way to do things . We want to do this one the right way . These folks have probably done already trompled up most of the evidence . But at least we can make an investigation according to police procedure regulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . He 's got to stay up again all night tonight . He 's got to get his sleep . " " Exactly , " Uncle Willy said . " Egg-zackly . Up all night , but not far enough up to see two damn scoundrels robbing my store in full view of the whole damn town . Robbed me of three hundred dollars ' worth of valuable medicine , yet Grover Winbush  --  " " How much cash did they get ? " Mr Connors said . " What ? " Uncle Willy said . " How much money was in the safe ? " " I do nt know , " Uncle Willy said . " I did n't count it .  --  Yet Grover Winbush that we pay a hundred and twenty-five a month just to wake up once an hour during the night and look around the Square , has got to get his sleep . If nobody'sgot a car here , get me a taxi . That son of a bitch has already cost me three hundred dollars ; I ai nt going to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held him hemmed off while somebody telephoned Grover Cleveland . And at first we thought that whoever telephoned and woke him up had scared him good too , until we learned the rest of it and realised all he needed for his scare was to hear that anything had happened anywhere in Jefferson last night that he would have seen if he had been where he was supposed to be or where folks thought he was . Because it was n't hardly any time before Ratliff said :  | " There he was . I jest seen him . " " Where ? " somebody said . " He jest snatched his head back in the alley yonder , " Ratliff said . We all watched the alley . It led from a side street onto the Square where Grover Cleveland could have cut across lots from his boarding house . Then he stepped out of it , already walking fast . He did n't wear a uniform like Mr Connors ; he wore ordinary clothes with usually his coattail hiked up over the handle of the pistol and the blackjack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pickinghis feet up quick like a cat on a hot stove . And if you thought it would have been Mr Connors or even Mr Hampton , the sheriff , that did the investigating , you would have been wrong . It was Uncle Willy himself . At first Grover Cleveland tried to bluff . Then he fell back on lying . Then he just fell back . " Howdy , son , " Uncle Willy said . " Sorry to wake you up in the middle of the night like this , just to answer a few questions . The first one is , just where were you , roughly , more or less , at exactly half past ten oclock last night , more or less ? " " Who , me ? " Grover Cleveland said . " Where I 'm always at at that time of night : standing right across yonder in the station door where if anybody after the last picture show might need anything , like maybe losing their car key or maybe they find out they got a flat tire  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And yet you never saw a light on in my store , and them two damned scoundrels  --  " " Wait , " Grover Cleveland said . " I 'm wrong . When I seen the last picture show beginning to let out , I noticed the time , half past ten or maybe twenty-five to eleven , and I decided to go down and close up the Blue Goose and get that out of the way while I had time . " The Blue Goose was a Negro cafe below the cotton gin . " I 'm wrong , " Grover Cleveland said . " That 's where I was . " Uncle Willy never said anything . He just turned his headp159enough and hollered " Walter ! " Walter came in . His grandfather had belonged to Uncle Willy 's grandfather before the Surrender and he and Uncle Willy were about the same age and a good deal alike , except that instead of morphine Walter would go into the medicinal alcohol every time Uncle Willy put the key down and turned his back , and if anything Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the back and said , " Who calling me ? " " I am , " Uncle Willy said . " Where were you at half past ten last night ? " " Who , me ? " Walter said , exactly like Grover Cleveland did , except he said it like Uncle Willy had asked him where he was when Dr. Einstein first propounded his theory of relativity . " You talking about last night ? " he said . " Where you reckon ? At home in bed . " " You were at that damned Blue Goose cafe , where you are every night until Grover Winbush here tomes in and runs all you niggers out and closes it up , " Uncle Willy said . " Then what you asking me , if you know so much ? " Walter said . " All right , " Uncle Willy said . " What time last night did Mr Winbush close it ? " Walter stood there , blinking . His eyes were always red . He made in an old-fashioned hand freezer the ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it in the cellar : a dark cool place with a single door opening onto the alley behind the store , sitting in the gloom and grinding the freezer , so that when you passed , about all you saw was his red eyes , looking not malevolent , not savage but just dangerous if you blundered out of your element and into his , like a dragon or a crocodile . He stood there , blinking . " What time did Grover Winbushclose up the Blue Goose ? " Uncle Willy said . " I left before that , " Walter said . Now suddenly , and we had n't noticed him before , Mr Hampton was there , doing some of the looking too . He did n't blink like Walter . Hep160was a big man with a big belly and little hard pale eyes that did n't seem to need to blink at all . They were looking at Grover Cleveland now . " How do you know you did ? " he said to Walter . " Hell fire , " Uncle Willy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the lights out since they first opened the door . " " I know that , " Mr Hampton said . He was still looking at Grover Cleveland with his little hard pale unblinking eyes . " I 've been marshal and sheriff both here a long time too . " He said to Grover Cleveland : " Where were you last night when folks needed you ? " But Grover Cleveland still tried ; you 'll have to give him that , even if now even he never believed in it : " Oh , you mean them two fellers in Uncle Willy 's store about half past ten last night . Sure , I seen them . I naturallythought , taken for granted it was Uncle Willy and Skeets . So I . . . " " So you what ? " Mr Hampton said . " I . . . stepped back inside and . . . taken up the eveningpaper , " Grover Cleveland said . " Yes , that 's where I was : setting right there in the station reading the Memphis evening paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here , he went back to the station looking for you , " Mr Hampton said . " He waited an hour . By that time the lights were off in here but he never saw anybody come out the front door . And you never showed up . And Walter there says you never showed up at the Blue Goose either . Where were you last night , Grover ? " So now there was n't anywhere for him to go . He just stood there with his coattail hiked up over the handle of his pistol and blackjack like a little boy 's shirttail coming out . Maybe that 's what it was : Grover Cleveland was too old to look like a boy . And Uncle Willy and Mr Hampton and all the rest of us looking at him until all of a sudden we were all ashamed to look at him any more , ashamed top161have to find out what we were going to find out . Except that Mr Hampton was n't ashamed to . Maybe it was being sheriff so long had made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to be ashamed of : it was all of us . " One night Doc Peabody was coming back from a case about one oclock and he saw you coming out of that alley side door to what Montgomery Ward Snopes calls his studio . Another night I was going home late myself , about midnight , and I saw you going into it . What 's going on in there , Grover ? " Grover Cleveland did n't move now either . It was almost a whisper : " It 's a club . " Now Mr Hampton and Uncle Gavin were looking at each other . " Do nt look at me , " Uncle Gavin said . " You 're the law . " That was the funny thing : neither one of them paid any attention to Mr Connors , who was the marshal and ought to have been attending to this already . Maybe that was why . " You 're the County Attorney , " Mr Hampton said . " You 're the one to say what the law is before I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Maybe Grover wants to tell us what it is and save time , " Mr Hampton said . " No , dammit , " Uncle Gavin said . " Take your foot off him for a minute anyway . " He said to Grover Cleveland : " You go on back to the station until we need you . " " You can read the rest of that Memphis paper , " Mr Hampton said . " And we wont want you either , " he said to Mr Connors . " Like hell , Sheriff , " Mr Connors said . " Your jurisdiction'sjust the county . What goes on in Jefferson is my jurisdiction . I got as much right  --  " He stopped then but it was already too late . Mr Hampton looked at him with the little hard pale eyes that never seemed to need to blink at all . " Go on , " Mr Hampton said . " Got as much right top162see what Montgomery Ward Snopes has got hid as me and Gavin have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that club then ? " But Mr Connors could still blink . " Come on , " Mr Hampton said to Uncle Gavin , turnirig . Uncle Gavin moved too . " That means you too , " he said to me . " That means all of you , " Mr Hampton said . " All of you get out of Uncle Willy 's way now . He 's got to make a list of what 's missing for the narcotics folks and the insurance too . " So we stood on the street and watched Mr Hampton and Uncle Gavin go on toward Montgomery Ward 's studio . " What ? " I said to Ratliff . " I do nt know , " he said . " That is , I reckon I know . We 'll have to wait for Hub and your uncle to prove it . " " What do you reckon it is ? " I said . Now he looked at me . " Let 's see , " he said . " Even if you are nine going on ten , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Come on . We wont bother Uncle Willy and Skeets now neither . We 'll go to the Dixie Cafe . " So we went to the Dixie Cafe and got two cones and stood on the street again . " What ? " I said . " My guess is , it 's a passel of French postcards MontgomeryWard brought back from the war in Paris . I reckon you do nt know what that is , do you ? " " I do nt know , " I said . " It 's Kodak pictures of men and women together , experimenting with one another . Without no clothes on much . " I do nt know whether he was looking at me or not . " Do you know now ? " " I do nt know , " I said . " But maybe you do ? " he said . That 's what it was . Uncle Gavin said he had a big album of them , and that he had learned enough about photography to have made slides from some of them so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magic lantern in that back room . And he said how Montgomery Ward stood there laughing at him and Mr Hampton both . But he was talking mostly to Uncle Gavin . " Oh sure , " he said . " I do nt expect Hub here  --  " " Call me Mister Hampton , " Mr Hampton said . "  --  to know any better  --  " " Call me Mister Hampton , boy , " Mr Hampton said . " Mister Hampton , " Montgomery Ward said . "  --  but you 're a lawyer ; you do nt think I got into this without reading a little law first myself , do you ? You can confiscate these  --  all you 'll find here ; I do nt guess Mister Hampton will let a little thing like law stop him from that  --  " That was when Mr Hampton slapped him . " Stop it , Hub ! " Uncle Gavin said . " You damned fool ! " " Let him go ahead , " Montgomery Ward said . " Suing his bondsmen is easier than running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh yes . Even if they had been sent through the mail , which they have n't , that would just be a federal charge , and I do nt see any federal dicks around here . And even if you tried to cook up a charge that I 've been making money out of them , where are your witnesses ? All you got is Grover Winbush , and he do nt dare testify , not because he will lose his job because he 'll probably do that anyway , but because the God-fearing Christian holy citizens of Jefferson wont let him because they cant have it known that this is what their police do when they 're supposed to be at work . Let alone the rest of nay customers , not to mention any names scattered around in banks and stores and gins and filling stations and farms too two counties wide in either direction  --  sure : I just thought of this too : come on , put a fine on me and see how quick it will be paid . . . " and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet Christ . " He was talking fast now : " Come on , lock me up , give me a thousand stamped envelopes and I 'll make more money in three days thanp164I made in the whole two years with that damned magic lantern . " Now he was talking to Mr Hampton : " Maybe that 's what you wanted , to begin with : not the postcards but the list of customers ; retire from sheriff and spend all your time on the collections . Or no : keep the star to bring pressure on the slow payers  --  " Only this time Uncle Gavin did n't have to say anything because this time Mr Hampton was n't going to hit him . He just stood there with his little hard eyes shut until MontgomeryWard stopped . Then he said to Uncle Gavin : " Is that right ? We 've got to have a federal officer ? There 's nothing on our books to touch him with ? Come on , think . Nothing on the city books even ? " Now it was Uncle Gavin who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " That Sartoris law , " while Mr Hampton stood looking at him . " Hanging right there in that frame on the wall by your own office door ? Did n't you ever look at it ? That you cant drive an automobileon the streets of Jefferson  --  " " What ? " Montgomery Ward said . " Louder , " Uncle Gavin said . " Mr Hampton cant hear you . " " But that 's just inside the city ! " Montgomery Ward said . " Hampton 's just County Sheriff ; he cant make an arrest on just a city charge . " " So you say , " Mr Hampton said ; now he did put his hand on Montgomery Ward 's shoulder ; Uncle Gavin said if he had been Montgomery Ward , he 'd just as soon Mr Hampton had slapped him again . " Tell your own lawyer , not ours . " " Wait ! " Montgomery Ward said to Uncle Gavin . " You own a car too ! So does Hampton ! " " We 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've passed the H 's . We 're in S now , and S-n comes before S-t . Take him on , Hub . " So Montgomery Ward did n't have anywhere to go then ,  |p165he  had run completely out ; he just stood there now and Uncle Gavin watched Mr Hampton take his hand off Montgomery Ward and pick up the album of pictures and the envelopes that held the rest of them and carry them to the sink where Montgomery Ward really would develop a film now and then , and tumble them in and then start hunting among the bottles and cans of developer stuff on the shelf above it . " What are you looking for ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Alcohol  --  coal oil  --  anything that 'll bum , " Mr Hamptonsaid . " Bum ? " Montgomery Ward said . " Hell , man , those things are valuable . Look , I 'll make a deal : give them back to me and I 'll get to hell out of your damned town and it 'll never see me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got close to a hundred bucks in my pocket . I 'll lay it on the table here and you and Stevens turn your backs and give me ten min-utes  --  " " Do you want to come back and hit him again ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Do nt mind me . Besides , he 's already suggestedwe turn our backs so all you 'll have to do is just swing your arm . " But Mr Hampton just took another bottle down and took out the stopper and smelled . " You cant do that , " Uncle Gavin said . " They 're evidence . " " All we need is just one , " Mr Hampton said . " That depends , " Uncle Gavin said . " Do you just want to convict him , or do you want to exterminate him ? " Mr Hampton stopped , the bottle in one hand and the stopper in the other . " You know what Judge Long will do to the man that just owns one of these pictures . " Judge Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 'll do to the man that owns a wheelbarrow full of them . " So Mr Hampton put the bottle back and after a while a deputy came with a suitcase and they put the album and the envelopes into it and locked it and Mr Hampton locked the suitcase in his safe to turn over to Mr Gombault , thep166U . S. marshal , when he got back to town , and they locked Montgomery Ward up in the county jail for operating an automobile contrary to law in the city of Jefferson , with Montgomery Ward cussing a while then threatening a while then trying again to bribe anybody connected with the jail or the town that would take the money . And we wondered how long it would be before he sent for Mr de Spain because of that connection . Because we knew that the last person on earth he would hope for help from would be his uncle or cousin Flem , who had already got shut of one Snopes through a murder charge so why should he balk at getting rid of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gavin , that Ratliff said made a kind of religion of never letting Jefferson see that a Snopes had surprised him , did n't expect Mr Flem that afternoon when he walked into the office and laid his new black hat on the corner of the desk and sat there with the joints of his jaws working faint and steady like he was trying to chew without unclamping his teeth . You could n't see behind Mr Hampton'seyes because they looked at you too hard ; you could n't pass them like you could n't pass a horse in a lane that was n't big enough for a horse and a man both but just for the horse . You could n't see behind Mr Snopes 's eyes because they were not really looking at you at all , like a pond of stagnant water is not looking at you . Uncle Gavin said that was why it took him a minute or two to realise that he and Mr Snopes were looking at exactly the same thing : it just was n't with the same eye . " I 'm thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I , " Uncle Gavin said . " Of that damned Grover Winbush and every other arrested adolescent between fourteenand fifty-eight in half of north Mississippi with twenty-five cents to pay for one look inside that album . " " I forgot about Grover Winbush , " Mr Snopes said . " He wont only lose his job but when he does folks will wantp167to know why and this whole business will come out . " That was Mr Snopes 's trouble . I mean , that was our trouble with Mr Snopes : there was n't anything to see even when you thought he might be looking at you . " I do nt know whether you know it or not . His ma lives out at Whiteleaf . He sends her a dollar 's worth of furnish by the mail rider every Saturday morning . " " So to save one is to save both , " Uncle Gavin said . " If Grover Winbush 's mother is to keep on getting that dollar 's worth of fatback and molasses every Saturday morning , somebody will have to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  too . " Like Ratliff said , Mr Snopes probably missed a lot folks said to him behind his back , but he never missed what folks did n't say to him to his face . Anyway , irony and sarcasm was not one of them . Or anyway it was n't this time . " That 's how I figgered it , " he said . " But you 're a lawyer . Your business is to know how to figger different . " Uncle Gavin did n't miss much of what was n't quite said to his face either . " You 've come to the wrong lawyer , " he said . " This case is in federal court . Besides , I could n't take it anyway ; I draw a monthly salary to already be on the other side . Besides , " he said ( while he was just City Attorneyhe talked Harvard and Heidelberg . But after that summer he and I spent travelling about the county running for County Attorney , he began to talk like the people he would lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , saying " drug " for " dragged " and " me and you " instead of " you and I " just like they did , even saying figgeredjust like Mr Snopes just said it ) , " let 's you and me get together on this . I want him to go to the penitentiary . " And that 's when Uncle Gavin found out that he and Mr. Snopes were looking at exactly the same thing : they were just standing in different places because Mr Snopes said , as quick and calm as Uncle Gavin himself : " So do I. " Because Montgomery Ward was his rival just like Wallstreet was ,  |p168both  of them alike in that there just was n't room in Jefferson for either one of them and Mr Snopes too . Because according to Ratliff , Uncle Gavin was missing it . " So do I , " Mr Snopes said . " But not this way . I 'm thinking of Jefferson . " " Then it 's just too bad for Jefferson , " Uncle Gavin said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those pictures , let alone a suitcase full of them , I will almost feel sorry even for Montgomery Ward . Have you forgotten about Wilbur Provine last year ? " Wilbur Provine lived in Frenchman 's Bend too . Ratliff said he was really a Snopes ; that when Providence realised that Eck Snopes was going to fail his lineage and tradition , it hunted around quick and produced Wilbur Provine to plug the gap . He ran a still in the creek bottom by a spring about a mile and a half from his house , with a path worn smooth as a ribbon and six inches deep from his back door to the spring where he had walked it twice a day for two years until they caught him and took him to federal court before Judge Long , looking as surprised and innocent as if he did n't even know what the word " still " meant while the lawyer questioned him , saying No , he never had any idea there was a still within ten miles , let alone a path leading from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in that creek bottom in ten years , not even to hunt and fish since he was a Christian and he believed that no Christianshould destroy God 's creatures , and he had burned out on fish when he was eight years old and had n't been able to eat it since . Until Judge Long himself asked him how he accounted for that path , and Wilbur blinked at Judge Long once or twice and said he did n't have any idea , unless maybe his wife had worn it toting water from the spring ; and Judge Long ( he had the right name , he was six and a half feet tall and his nose looked almost a sixth of that ) leaning down across the bench with his spectacles at the end of his nose , looking down at Wilbur for a while , until he said :  | " I 'm going to send you to the penitentiary , not for making whiskey but for letting your wife carry water a mile and a half from that spring . " That was who Montgomery Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have thought that everybody in Yoknapatawpha County , let alone just Jefferson , had heard the story by now . But you would almost thought Mr Snopes had n't . Because now even the hinges of his jaws had quit that little faint pumping . " I heard Judge Long gave him five years , " he said . " Maybe them extra four years was for the path . " " Maybe , " Uncle Gavin said . " It was five years , was n't it ? " Mr Snopes said . " That 's right , " Uncle Gavin said . " Send that boy out , " Mr Snopes said . " No , " Uncle Gavin said . Now the hinges of Mr Snopes 's jaws were pumping again . " Send him out , " he said . " I 'm thinking of Jefferson too , " Uncle Gavin said . " You 're vice president of Colonel Sartoris 's bank . I 'm even thinking of you . " " Much obliged , " Mr Snopes said . He was n't looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't hurrying either : he just got up and took the new black hat from the desk and put it on and went to the door and opened it and did n't quite stop even then , just kind of changing feet to step around the opening door and said , not to anybody any more than he had ever been looking at anybody : " Good day , " and went out and closed the door behind him . Then I said , " What  --  " and then stopped , Uncle Gavin and I both watching the door as it opened again , or began to , opening about a foot with no sound beyond it until we saw Ratliff 's cheek and one of his eyes , then Ratliff came in , eased in , sidled in , still not making any sound . " Am I too late , or jest too soon ? " he said . " Neither , " Uncle Gavin said . " He stopped , decided not to . Something happened . The pattern went wrong . Itp170started out all regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and least of all for my kinsman . Do you know what he said ? " " How can I yet ? " Ratliff said . " That 's what I 'm doing now . " " I said You and I should get together . I want him to go to the penitentiary . ' And he said , So do I. ' " " All right , " Ratliff said . " Go on . " "  --  not for me , my kinsman , ' " Uncle Gavin said . " For Jefferson . ' So the next step should have been the threat . Only he did n't  --  " " Why threat ? " Ratliff said . " The pattern , " Uncle Gavin said . " First the soap , then the threat , then the bribe . As Montgomery Ward himself tried it . " " This ai nt Montgomery Ward , " Ratliff said . " If MontgomeryWard had been named Flem , them pictures would n't a never seen Jefferson , let alone vice versa . But we do nt need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most anybody around here is that . What we got to worry about is , who else around here may not be as smart as him too . Then what ? " " He quit , " Uncle Gavin said . " He came right up to it . He even asked me to send Chick out . And when I said No , he just picked up his hat and said Much obliged and went out as if he had just stopped in here to borrow a match . " Ratliff blinked at Uncle Gavin . " So he wants MontgomeryWard to go to the penitentiary . Only he do nt want him to go under the conditions he 's on his way there now . Then he changed his mind . " " Because of Chick , " Uncle Gavin said . " Then he changed his mind , " Ratliff said . " You 're right , " Uncle Gavin said . " It was because he knew that by refusing to send Chick out I had already refused to be bribed . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt a manp171breathing that cant be bought for something ; all you need to do is jest to find it . Only , why did he change his mind ? " " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " Why ? " " What was the conversation about jest before he told you to send Chick out ? " " About the penitentiary , " Uncle Gavin said . " I just told you . " " It was about Wilbur Provine , " I said . Ratliff looked at me . " Wilbur Provine ? " " His still , " I said . " That path and Judge Long . " " Oh , " Ratliff said . " Then what ? " " That 's all , " Uncle Gavin said . " He just said Send that boy out ' and I said  --  " " That was n't next , " I said . " The next was what Mr Snopes said about the five years , that maybe the extra four years was for the path , and you said Maybe and Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? ' and you said Yes and then he said to send me out . " " All right , all right , " Uncle Gavin said . But he was looking at Ratliff . " Well ? " he said . " I do nt know neither , " Ratliff said . " All I know is , I 'm glad I ai nt Montgomery Ward Snopes . " " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " When Judge Long sees that suitcase . " " Sho , " Ratliff said . " That 's jest Uncle Sam . It 's his Uncle Flem that Montgomery Ward wants to worry about , even if he do nt know it yet . And us too . As long as all he wanted was jest money , at least you knowed which way to guess even if you knowed you could n't guess first . But this time  --  " He looked at us , blinking . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " How ? " " You mind that story about how the feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined where he would be if he was that dog and got up and went and got it and brung it home . All right . We 're Flem Snopes . We got a chance to get shut of our  --  what 's that old-timey word ?  |p172unsavory   --  unsavory nephew into the penitentiary . Only we 're vice president of a bank now and we cant afford to have it knowed even a unsavory nephew was running a peep show of French postcards . And the judge that will send him there is the same judge that told Wilbur Provine he was going to Parchman not for making whiskey but for letting his wife tote water a mile and a half . " He blinked at Uncle Gavin . " You 're right . The question ai nt what ' a-tall : it 's jest how . ' And since you was n't interested in money , and he has got better sense than to offer it to Hub Hampton , we do nt jest know what that how ' is going to be . Unless maybe since he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is depending on Providence . " Maybe he was . Anyway , it worked . It was the next morning , about ten oclock ; Uncle Gavin and I were just leaving the office to drive up to Wyott 's Crossing where they were having some kind of a squabble over a drainage tax suit , when Mr Hampton came in . He was kind of blowing through his teeth , light and easy like he was whistlingexcept that he was n't making any noise and even less than that of tune . " Morning , " he said . " Yesterday morning when we were in that studio and I was hunting through them bottles on that shelf for alcohol or something that would burn . " " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " How many of them bottles and jugs did I draw the cork or unscrew the cap and smell ? You were there . You were watching . " " I thought all of them , " Uncle Gavin said . " Why ? " " So did I , " Mr Hampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Uncle Gavin with his hard little eyes , making that soundless whistling between his teeth . " You 've prepared us , " Uncle Gavin said . " Got us intothe right state of nervous excitement . Now tell us . " " About six this morning , Jack Crenshaw telephoned me . " ( Mr Crenshaw was the Revenue field agent that did thep173moonshine still hunting in our district . ) " He told me to come on to that studio as soon as I could . They were alreadyinside , two of them . They had already searched it . Two of them gallon jugs on that shelf that I opened and smelled yesterday that never had nothing but Kodak developerin them , had raw corn whiskey in them this morning , though like I said I could have been wrong and missed them . Not to mention five gallons more of it in a oil can setting behind the heater , that I had n't got around to smelling yesterday when you stopped me for the reason that I never seen it there when I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottles on that shelf for something to burn paper with . Though , as you say , I could be wrong . " " As you say , " Uncle Gavin said . " You may be right , " Mr Hampton said . " After all , I 've been having to snuff out moonshine whiskey in this county ever since I first got elected . And since 1919 , I have been so in practice that now I do nt even need to smell : I just kind of feel it the moment I get where some of it ai nt supposedto be . Not to mention that five-gallon coal oil can full of it setting where you would have thought I would have fell over it reaching my hand to that shelf . " " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " Go on . " " That 's all , " Mr Hampton said . " How did he get in ? " Uncle Gavin said . " He ? " Mr Hampton said . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I thought of that too , " Mr Hampton said . " The key . I said the key because even that fool would have more sense than to have a key to that place anywhere except on a string around his neck . " " That one , " Uncle Gavin said . " Yep , " Mr Hampton said . " I dropped it into the drawer where I usually keep such , handcuffs and a extrap174pistol . Anybody could have come in while me and Miss Elma " ( she was the office deputy , widow of the sheriff Mr Hampton had succeeded last time ) " was out , and taken it . " " Or the pistol either , " Uncle Gavin said . " You really should start locking that place , Hub . Some day you 'll leave your star in there and come back to find some little boy out on the street arresting people . " " Maybe I should , " Mr Hampton said . " All right , " he said . " Somebody took that key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them  --  any of the folks that that damned Grover Winbush says was coming from four countiesaround to sweat over them damn pictures at night . " " Maybe it 's lucky you at least had that suitcase locked up . I suppose you 've still got that , since Mr Gombault has n't got back yet ? " " That 's right , " Mr Hampton said . " And Jack Crenshaw and his buddy are just interested in whiskey , not photography . Which means you have n't turned that suitcase over to anybody yet . " " That 's right , " Mr Hampton said . " Are you going to ? " Uncle Gavin said . " What do you think ? " Mr Hampton said . " That 's what I think too , " Uncle Gavin said . " After all , the whiskey is enough , " Mr Hampton said . " And even if it ai nt , all we got to do is show Judge Long just any one of them photographs right before he pronouncessentence . Damn it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Jefferson 's got to come first , even before the pleasure of crucifying that damned  --  " " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " I 've heard that sentiment . " Then Mr Hampton left . And all we had to do was just to wait , and not long . You never had to wonder about how much Ratliff had heard because you knew in advance he had heard all of it . He closed the door and stood just inside it . " Why did n't you tell him yesterday about Flem Snopes ? " he said.  | " Because he let Flem Snopes or whoever it was walk right in his office and steal that key . Hub 's already got about all the felonious malfeasance he can afford to compound , " Uncle Gavin said . He finished putting the papers into the briefcase and closed it and stood up . " You leaving ? " Ratliff said . " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " Wyott 's Crossing . " " You ai nt going to wait for Flem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gavin said . " He wont dare . What he came here yesterday to try to bribe me to do is going to happen anyway without the bribe . But he do nt dare come back here to find out . He will have to wait and see like anybody else . He knows that . " But still Ratliff did n't move from the door . " The trouble with us is , we do nt never estimate Flem Snopes right . At first we made the mistake of not estimatinghim a-tall . Then we made the mistake of overestimating him . Now we 're fixing to make the mistake of underestimatinghim again . When you jest want money , all you need to do to satisfy yourself is count it and put it where cant nobodyget it , and forget about it . But this-here new thing he has done found out it 's nice to have , is different . It 's like keeping warm in winter or cool in summer , or peace or being free or contentment . You cant jest count it and lock it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like looking at it again . You got to work at it steady , never to forget about it . It 's got to be out in the open , where folks can see it , or there ai nt no such thing . " " No such thing as what ? " Uncle Gavin said . " This-here new discovery he 's jest made , " Ratliff said . " Call it civic virtue . " " Why not ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Were you going to call it something else ? " Ratliff watched Uncle Gavin , curious , intent ; it was as if he were waiting for something . " Go on , " Uncle Gavin said . " You were saying . " Then it was gone , whatever it had been . " Oh yes , " Ratliffsaid . " He 'll be in to see you . He 'll have to , to make shop176you recognize it too when you see it . He may kind of hang around until middle of the afternoon , to kind of give the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , so a feller can at least see jest how much he missed heading him off . " So we did n't drive up to Wyott 's then , and this time Ratliff was the one who underestimated . It was n't a half an hour until we heard his feet on the stairs and the door opened and he came in . This time he did n't take off the black hat : he just said " Morning , gentlemen " and came on to the desk and dropped the key to Montgomery Ward 's studio on it and was going back toward the door when Uncle Gavin said : " Much obliged . I 'll give it back to the sheriff . You 're like me , " he said . " You do nt give a damn about truth either . What you are interested in is justice . " " I 'm interested in Jefferson , " Mr Snopes said , reaching for the door and opening it . " We got to live here . Morning , gentlemen . "  |p177And  still he missed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and actively watching Flem rid Jefferson of MontgomeryWard . And still I could n't tell him.  |p178Whatever  it was Ratliff thought Mr Snopes wanted , I do nt reckon that what Uncle Gavin took up next helped it much either . And this time he did n't even have Miss MelisandreBackus for Mother to blame it on because Miss Melisandre herself was married now , to a man , a stranger , that everybody but Miss Melisandre ( we never did know whether her father , sitting all day long out there on that front gallery with a glass of whiskey-and-water in one hand and Horace or Virgil in the other  --  a combination which Uncle Gavin said would have insulated from the reality of rural north Mississippi harder heads than his  --  knew or not ) knew was a big rich New Orleans bootlegger . In fact she still refused to believe it even when they brought him home with a bullet hole neatly plugged up in the middle of his forehead , in a bullet-proof hearse leading a cortege of Packards and Cadillac limousines that Hollywooditself , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , that 's wrong . We never did know whether she knew it or not too , even years after he was dead and she had all the money and the two children and the place which in her childhood had been just another Mississippi cotton farm but which he had changed with white fences and weather-vanes in the shape of horses so that it looked like a cross between a Kentucky country club and a Long Island race track , and plenty of friends who felt they owed it to her that she should know where all that money actually came from ; and still , as soon as they approached the subject , she would change it  --  the slender dark girl still , even though she was a millionairess and the mother of two children , whose terrible power was that defenselessness and helplessness which conferred knighthood on any man who came within range , before he had a chance to turn andp179flee  --  changing the entire subject as if she had never heard her husband 's name or , in fact , as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't even say " If he would only marry Melisandre Backus , she would save him from all this , " meaning Linda Snopes this time like she had meant Mrs Flem Snopes before . But at least she thought about saying it because almost at once she stopped worrying . " It 's all right , " she told Father . " It 's the same thing again : do nt you remember ? He never was really interested in Melisandre . I mean . . . you know : really interested . Books and flowers . Picking my jonquils and narcissus as fast as they bloomed , to send out there where that whole two-acre front yard was full of jonquils , cutting my best roses to take out there and sit in that hammock reading poetry to her . He was just forming her mind : that 's all he wanted . And Melisandre was only five years younger , where with this one he is twice her age , practically her grandfather . Of course that 's all it is . " Then Father said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's on Gavin 's mind , not hers . It would be on mine too if I was n't already married and scared to look . Did you ever take a look at her ? You 're human even if you are a woman . " Yes , I could remember a heap of times when Father had been born too soon , before they thought of wolf whistles . " Stop it , " Mother said . " But after all , " Father said , " maybe Gavin should be saved from those sixteen-year-old clutches . Suppose you speak to him ; tell him I am willing to make a sacrifice of myself on the family altar  --  " " Stop it ! Stop it ! " Mother said . " Cant you at least be funny ? " " I 'm worse than that , I 'm serious , " Father said . " They were at a table in Christian 's yesterday afternoon . Gavin just had a saucer of ice cream but she was eating something in a dish that must have set him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doing after all ; she 's got some looks of her own , but she still ai nt quite up with her mother : you know  --  " using both hands to make a kind of undulating hourglass shape in the air in front of him while Mother stood watching him like a snake . " Maybe he 's concentrating on just forming her form first you might say , without bothering too much yet about her mind . And who knows ? Maybe some day she 'll even look at him like she was looking at that banana split or whatever it was when Skeets McGowan set it down in front of her . " But by that time Mother was gone . And this time she sure needed somebody like Miss Melisandre , with all her friends ( all Jefferson for that matter ) on the watch to tell her whenever Uncle Gavin and Linda stopped in Christian 's drugstore after school while Linda ate another banana split or ice-cream , soda , with the last book of poetry Uncle Gavin had ordered for her lying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Because I reckon Jefferson was too small for a thirty-five-year-old bachelor , even a Harvard M.A. and a Ph.D . from Heidelberg and his hair already beginning to turn white even at just twentyfive , to eat ice cream and read poetry with a **26;10453;TOOLONG girl . Though if it had to happen , maybe thirty-five was the best age for a bachelor to buy ice cream and poetry for a sixteen-year-old girl . I told Mother that . She did n't sound like a snake because snakes cant talk . But if dentist 's drills could talk she would have sounded just like one . " There 's no best or safe age for a bachelor anywhere betweenthree and eighty to buy ice cream for a sixteen-yearoldgirl , " she said . " Forming her mind , " she said . But she sounded just like cream when she talked to Uncle Gavin . No : she did n't sound like anything because she did n't say anything . She waited for him to begin it . No : she just waited because she knew he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I mean Uncle Gavin had lived in Jefferson or in little towns all his life , so he not onlyp181knew what Jefferson would be saying about him and Linda Snopes and those banana splits and ice-cream sodas and books of poetry by now , but that Mother had too many good friends to ever miss hearing about it . So she just waited . It was Saturday . Uncle Gavin walked twice in and out of the office ( we still called it that because Grandfather had , except when Mother could hear us . Though after a while even she stopped trying to call it the library ) where Mother was sitting at the desk adding up something , maybe the laundry ; he walked in and out twice and she never moved . Then he said : " I was thinking  --  " Because they were like that . I mean , I thought the reason they were like that was because they were twins . I mean , I assumed that because I did n't know any other twins to measure them against . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Why not tomorrow ? " So he could have gone out then , since obviously both of them knew what the other was talking about . But he said : " Thank you . " Then he said to me : " Ai nt Aleck Sander waiting for you outside ? " " Fiddlesticks , " Mother said . " Anything he will learn about sixteen-year-old girls from you will probably be a good deal more innocent than what he will learn some day from sixteen-year-old girls . Shall I telephone her mother and ask her to let her come for dinner tomorrow , or do you want to ? " " Thank you , " Uncle Gavin said . " Do you want me to tell you about it ? " " Do you want to ? " Mother said . " Maybe I 'd better , " Uncle Gavin said . " Do you have to ? " Mother said . This time Uncle Gavin did n't say anything . Then Mother said : " All right . We 're listening . " Again Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Gavin again . I mean , until now he sounded a good deal like I sounded sometimes . But now he stood looking at the back of Mother 's head , with hisp182shock of white hair that always needed cutting and the stained bitt of the corncob pipe sticking out of his breast pocket and the eyes and the face that you never did quite know what they were going to say next except that when you heard it you realised it was always true , only a little cranksided that nobody else would have said it quite that way . " Well , well , " he said , " if that 's what a mind with no more aptitude for gossip and dirt than yours is inventing and thinking , just imagine what the rest of Jefferson , the experts , have made of it by now . By Cicero , it makes me feel young already ; when I go to town this morning I believe I will buy myself a red necktie . " He looked at the back of Mother 's head . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need all of us of good will . To save Jefferson from Snopeses is a crisis , an emergency , a duty . To save a Snopes from Snopeses is a privilege , an honor , a pride . " " Especially a sixteen-year-old female one , " Mother said . " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " Do you deny it ? " " Have I tried to ? " Mother said . " Yes , you have tried . " He moved quick and put his hand on the top of her head , still talking . " And bless you for it . Tried always to deny that damned female instinct for uxorious and rigid respectability which is the backbone of any culture not yet decadent , which remains strong and undecadent only so long as it still produces an incorrigible unreconstructible with the temerity to assail and affront and deny it  --  like you  --  " and for a second both of us thought he was going to bend down and kiss her ; maybe all three of us thought it . Then he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me alone . Make up your mind : do you want me to telephone her , or will you do it ? " " 1 ' 11 do it , " he said . He looked at me . " Two red ties : one for you . I wish you were sixteen too . What she needs is a beau . "  | " Then if by being sixteen I 'd have to be her beau , I 'm glad I 'm not sixteen , " I said . " She 's already got a beau . Matt Levitt . He won the Golden Gloves up in Ohio or somewhere last year . He acts like he can still use them . Would like to , too . No , much obliged , " I said . " What 's that ? " Mother said . " Nothing , " Uncle Gavin said . " You never saw him box then , " I said . " Or you would n't call him nothing . I saw him once . With Preacher Birdsong . " " And just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother said . " He ai nt sporting , " I said . " He lives out in the country . He learned to box in France in the war . He and Matt Levitt  --  " " Let me , " Uncle Gavin said . " He  --  " " Which he ? " Mother said . " Your rival ? " "  --  is from Ohio , " Uncle Gavin said . " He graduated from that new Ford mechanics ' school and the company sent him here to be a mechanic in the agency garage  --  " " He 's the one that owns that yellow cut-down racer , " I said . " And Linda rides in it ? " Mother said. "  --  and since Jefferson is not that large and he has two eyes , " Uncle Gavin said , " sooner or later he saw Linda Snopes , probably somewhere between her home and the school house ; being male and about twenty-one , he naturally lost no time in making her acquaintance ; the Golden Gloves reputation which he either really brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have expected  --  " " Except you , " Mother said . " That 's all , " Uncle Gavin said . " Except you , " Mother said . " He 's maybe five years her senior , " Uncle Gavin said . " I 'm twice her age . " " Except you , " Mother said . " I do nt think you will livep184long enough to ever be twice any woman 's age , I do nt care what it is . " " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " What was it I just said ? To save Jefferson from a Snopes is a duty ; to save a Snopes from a Snopes is a privilege . " " An honor , you said , " Mother said . " A pride . " " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " A joy then . Are you pleased now ? " That was all , then . After a while Father came home but Mother did n't have much to tell him he did n't already know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep on needing the wolf whistle that had n't been invented yet ; not until the next day after dinner in fact . She arrived a little after twelve , just about when she could have got here after church if she had been to church . Which maybe she had , since she was wearing a hat . Or maybe it was her mother who made her wear the hat on account of Mother , coming up the street from the corner , running . Then I saw that the hat was a little awry on her head , as if something had pulled or jerked at it or it had caught on something in passing , and that she was holding one shoulder with the other hand . Then I saw that her face was mad . It was scared too , but right now it was mostly just mad as she turned in the gate , still holding her shoulder but not running now , just walking fast and hard , the mad look beginning to give way to the scared one . Then they both froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up fast from the corner  --  Matt Levitt 's racer because there were other stripped-down racers around now but his was the only one with that big doublebarrelbrass horn on the hood that played two notes when he pressed the button , going past fast ; and suddenly it was like I had smelled something , caught a whiff of something for a second that even if I located it again I still would n't know whether I had ever smelled it before or not ; the racer going on and Linda still walking rigid and fast withp185her hat on a little crooked and still holding her shoulder and still breathing a little fast even if what was on her face now was mostly being scared , on to the gallery where Mother and Uncle Gavin were waiting . " Good morning , Linda , " Mother said . " You 've torn your sleeve . " " It caught on a nail , " Linda said . " I can see , " Mother said . " Come on up to my room and slip it off and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , " Linda said . " If you 've just got a pin . " " Then you take the needle and do it yourself while I see about dinner , " Mother said . " You can sew , cant you ? " " Yessum , " Linda said . So they went up to Mother 's room and Uncle Gavin and I went to the office so Father could say to Uncle Gavin : " Somebody been mauling at her before she could even get here ? What 's the matter , boy ? Where 's your spear and sword ? Where 's your white horse ? " Because Matt did n't blow the two-toned horn when he passed that first time so none of us knew yet what Linda was listening for , sitting at the dinner table with the shoulder of her dress sewed back all right but looking like somebody about ten years old had done it and her face still looking rigid and scared . Because we did n't realise it then . I mean , that she was having to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was enjoying her dinner and having to remember her manners in a strange house and with folks that she did n't have any particular reason to think were going to like her , and still having to wonder what Matt Levitt would do next without letting anybody know that 's what was mainly on her mind . I mean , having to expect what was going to happen next and then , even while it was happening , having to look like she was eating and saying Yessum and Nome to what Mother was saying , and that cut-down racer going past in the street again with that two-toned horn blowing this time , blowing all the way past the house , and Fatherp186suddenly jerking his head up and making a loud snuffing noise , saying , " What 's that I smell ? " " Smell ? " Mother said . " Smell what ? " " That , " Father said . " Something we have n't smelled around here in . . . how long was it , Gavin ? " Because I knew now what Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Gowan just told me . And Mother knew too . I mean , she remembered , since she had heard the other one when it was Mr de Spain 's cut-out . I mean , even if she did n't know enough to connect that two-toned horn with Matt Levitt , all she had to do was look at Linda and Uncle Gavin . Or maybe just Uncle Gavin 's face was enough , which is what you get for being twins with anybody . Because she said , " Charley , " and Father said : " Maybe Miss Snopes will excuse me this time . " He was talking at Linda now . " You see , whenever we have a pretty girl to eat with us , the prettier she is , the harder I try to make jokes so they will want to come back again . This time I just tried too hard . So if Miss Snopes will forgive me for trying too hard to be funny , I 'll forgive her for being too pretty . " " Good boy , " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tiptoe , at least it did n't wear spikes like the joke did . Let 's go out to the gallery where it 's cool , Maggie . " " Let 's , " Mother said . Then we were all standing there in the hall , looking at Linda . It was n't just being scared in her face now , of being a sixteen-year-old girl for the first time in the home of people that probably had already decided not to approve of her . I did n't know what it was . But Mother did , maybe because it was Mother she was looking at it with . " I think it will be cooler in the parlor , " Mother said . " Let 's go there . " But it was too late . We could hear the horn , not missing a note : da Da da Da da Da getting louder and louder then going past the house still not miss/ing a note as it faded on , and Linda staring at Mother for just another second or two with the desperation . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something like despair for a moment , but then that was gone too and her face was just rigid again . " I 've got to go , " she said . " I . . . excuse me , I 've got ... " Then at least she kind of got herself together . " Thank you for my dinner , Mrs Mallison , " she said . " Thank you for my dinner , Mr Mallison . Thank you for my dinner , Mr Gavin , " already moving toward the table where she had put the hat and her purse . But then I had n't expected her to thank me for it . " Let Gavin drive you home , " Mother said . " Gavin  --  " " No no , " she said . " I do nt  --  he do nt  --  " Then she was gone , out the front door and down the walk toward the gate , almost running again , then through the gate and then she was running , desperate and calm , not looking back . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father said . " You 're losing ground . Last time you at least picked out a Spanish-American War hero with an E.M.F. sportster . Now the best you can do is a Golden Gloves amateur with a homemade racer . Watch yourself , bud , or next time you 'll have a boy scout defying you to mortal combat with a bicycle . " " What ? " Mother said . " What would you do , " Father said , " if you were a twenty-one-year-old garage mechanic who had to work until six p.m. , and a white-headed old grandfather of a libertine was waylaying your girl on her way home from school every afternoon and tolling her into soda dens and plying her with ice cream ? Because how could he know that all Gavin wants is just to form her mind ? " Only it was n't every afternoon any more . It was n't any afternoon at all . I do nt know what happened , how it was done : whether she sent word to Uncle Gavin not to try to meet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he would n't see her , or whether maybe she stopped going to school at all for a while . Because she was in high school and I was in grammar school so there was no reason for me to know whether she was still going to school or not . Or whether she was still in Jefferson , for that matter . Becausenow and then I would see Matt Levitt in his racer after the garage closed in the afternoon , when Linda used to be with him , and now and then at night going to and from the picture show . But not any more now . He would be alone in the racer , or with another boy or man . But as far as I knew , Matt never saw her any more than Uncle Gavin did . And you could n't tell anything from Uncle Gavin . It used to be that on the way home from school I would see him and Linda inside Christian 's drugstore eating ice cream and when he or they saw me he would beckon me in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that there was no longer any reason to look in Christian 's when I passed  --  was the only difference in him . Then one day  --  it was Friday  --  he was sitting at the table inside waiting and watchingto beckon me inside , and even though there was no second dish on the table I thought that Linda had probably just stepped away for a moment , maybe to the perfume counter or the magazine rack , and even when I was inside and he said , " I 'm having peach . What do you want ? " I still expected Linda to step out from behind whatever for the moment concealed her . " Strawberry , " I said . On the table was the last book  --  it was John Donne  --  he had ordered for her . " It will cost the same dime to mail it to her here in Jefferson that it would cost if she were in Memphis , " he said . " Suppose I stand the ice cream and give you the dime and you take it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " I said . When Mr Snopes first came to Jeffersonhe rented the house . Then he must have bought it be/cause since he became vice president of the bank they had begun to fix it up . It was painted now and Mrs Snopes I reckon had had the wistaria arbor in the side yard fixed up and when I came through the gate Linda called me and I saw the hammock under the arbor . The wistaria was still in bloom and I remember how she looked with her black hair under it because her eyes were kind of the color of wistaria and her dress almost exactly was : lying in the hammock reading and I thought Uncle Gavin did n't need to send this book because she has n't finished the other one yet . Then I saw the rest of her school books on the ground beneath the hammock and that the one she was reading was geometry and I wondered if knowing she would rather study geometry than be out with him would make Matt Levitt feel much better than having her eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book and went on home . That was Friday . The next day , Saturday , I went to the baseball game and then I came back to the office to walk home with Uncle Gavin . We heard the feet coming up the outside stairs , more than two of them , making a kind of scuffling sound and we could even hear hard breathing and something like whispering , then the door kind of banged open and Matt Levitt came in , quick and fast , holding something clamped under his arm , and shoved the door back shut against whoever was trying to follow him inside , holding the door shut with his braced knee until he fumbled at the knob until he found how to shoot the bolt and lock it . Then he turned . He was good-looking . He did n't have a humorous or happy look , he had what Ratliff called a merry look , the merry look of a fellow that had n't heard yet that they had invented doubt . But he did n't even look merry now and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken to Linda yesterday  --  and kind of shot it onto the desk so that the ripped and torn pages came scuttering and scattering out across the desk and some of them even on down to the floor.  | " How do you like that ? " Matt said , coming on around the desk where Uncle Gavin had stood up . " Do nt you want to put up your dukes ? " he said . " But that 's right , you ai nt much of a fighter , are you ? But that 's O.K. ; I ai nt going to hurt you much anyway : just mark you up a little to freshen up your memory . " He did n't , he did n't seem to hit hard , his fists not travelling more than four or five inches it looked like , so that it did n't even look like they were drawing blood from Uncle Gavin 's lips and nose but just instead wiping the blood onto them ; two or maybe three blows before I could seem to move and grab up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand behind the door and raise it to swing at the back of Matt 's head as hard as I could . " You , Chick ! " Uncle Gavin said . " Stop ! Hold it ! " Though even with that , I would n't have thought Matt could have moved that fast . Maybe it was the Golden Gloves that did it . Anyway he turned and caught the stick and jerked it away from me almost before I knew it and naturally I thought he was going to hit me or Uncle Gavin or maybe both of us with it so I had already crouched to dive at his legs when he dropped the point of the stick like a bayoneted rifle , the point touching my chest just below the throat as if he were not holding me up but had really picked me up with the stick like you would a rag or a scrap of paper . " Tough luck , kid , " he said . " Nice going almost ; too bad your uncle telegraphed it for you , " and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , which was the first time I reckon that any of us realised that whoever it was he had locked out was still banging on it , and shot the bolt back and opened it , then stepped back himself as Linda came in , blazing ; yes , that 's exactly the word for it : blazing : and without even looking at Uncle Gavin or me , whirled onto her tiptoes and slapped Matt twice , first with her left hand and then the right , panting and crying at the same time :  | " You fool ! You ox ! You clumsy ignorant ox ! You clumsy ignorant stupid son of a bitch ! " Which was the first time I ever heard a sixteen-year-old girl say that . No : the first time I ever heard any woman say that , standing there facing Matt and crying hard now , like she was too mad to even know what to do next , whether to slap him again or curse him again , until Uncle Gavin came around the desk and touched her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and she turned and grabbed him , her face against his shirt where he had bled onto it , still crying hard , saying , " Mister Gavin , Mister Gavin , Mister Gavin . " " Open the door , Chick , " Uncle Gavin said . I opened it . " Get out of here , boy , " Uncle Gavin said to Matt . " Go on . " Then Matt was gone . I started to close the door . " You too , " Uncle Gavin said . " Sir ? " I said . " You get out too , " Uncle Gavin said , still holding Linda where she was shaking and crying against him , his nose bleeding onto her too now.  | " Go on , " I said . " You get out too . " So he did , and I stood there holding her . Or rather , she was gripping me , quite hard , shuddering and gasping , crying quite hard now , burrowing her face into my shirt so that I could feel my shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called tit for tat , since what Victorians would have called the claret from my nose had already stained the shoulder of her dress . So I could free one hand long enough to reach around and over her other shoulder to the handkerchief in my breast pocket and do a little emergency work with it until I could separate us long enough to reach the cold-water tap . " Stop it , " I said . " Stop it now . " But she only cried the harder , clutching me , saying , " Mister Gavin . Mister Gavin . Oh , Mister Gavin . " " Linda , " I said . " Can you hear me ? " She did n't answer , just clutching me ; I could feel her nodding her head against my chest . " Do you want to marry me ? " I said . " Yes ! " she said . " Yes ! All right ! All right ! " This time I got one hand under her chin and lifted her face by force until she would have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were gray , probably the same hard gray as Hub Hampton 's . Hers were not gray at all . They were darkest hyacinth , what I have always imagined that Homer 's hyacinthine sea must have had to look like . " Listen to me , " I said . " Do you want to get married ? " Yes , they do nt need minds at all , except for conversation , social intercourse . And I have known some who had charm and tact without minds even then . Because when they deal with men , with human beings , all they need is the instinct , the intuition before it became battered and dulled , thep193infinite capacity for devotion untroubled and unconfused by cold moralities and colder facts . " You mean I do nt have to ? " she said . " Of course not , " I said . " Never if you like . " " I do nt want to marry anybody ! " she said , cried ; she was clinging to me again , her face buried again in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose the front of my shirt and tie . " Not anybody ! " she said . " You 're all I have , all I can trust . I love you ! I love you ! "  |p194When  he got home , his face was clean . But his nose and his lip still showed , and there was n't anything he could have done about his shirt and tie . Except he could have bought new ones , since on Saturday the stores were still open . But he did n't . Maybe even that would n't have made any difference with Mother ; maybe that 's one of the other things you have to accept in being a twin . And yes sir , if dentist 's drills could talk , that 's exactly what Mother would have sounded like after she got done laughing and crying both and saying Damn you , Gavin , damn you , damn you , and Uncle Gavin had gone upstairs to put on a clean shirt and tie for supper . " Forming her mind , " Mother said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down or getting his nose bloodied . Like if Mr de Spain had n't knocked him down in the alley behind that Christmas dance , he could have got over Mrs Snopes without having to form Linda 's mind . And like if Matt Levitt had n't come into the office that afternoon and bloodied his nose again , he could have stopped there with Linda 's mind without having to do any more to it . So he did n't stop because he could n't . But at least he got rid of Matt Levitt . That was in the spring . It was her last year in high school ; she would graduate in May and any school afternoon I could see her walking along the street from school with a few books under her arm . But if any of them was poetry now I did n't know it , because when she came to Christian 's drugstore now she would n't even look toward the door , just walking on past with her face straight in front and her head up a little like the pointer just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking onp195like she saw people , saw Jefferson , saw the Square all right because at the moment , at any moment she had to walk on and among and through something and it might as well be Jefferson and Jefferson people and the Jefferson square as anything else , but that was all . Because Uncle Gavin was n't there somewhere around like an accident any more now . But then , if Uncle Gavin was n't sitting on the opposite side of that marble-topped table in Christian 's watching her eating something out of a tall glass that cost every bit of fifteen or twenty cents , Matt Levitt was n't there either . Him and his cut-down racer both because the racer was empty now except for Matt himself after the garage closed on week days , creeping along the streets and across the Square in low gear , parallelling but a little behind where she would be walking to the picture show now with another girl or maybe two or three of them , her head still high and not once looking at him while the racer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle-chuckle-chuckle , right up to the picture show and the two or three or four girls had gone into it . Then the racer would dash off at full speed around the block , to come rushing back with the cut-out as loud as he could make it , up the alley beside the picture show and then across in front of it and around the block and up the alley again , this time with Otis Harker , who had succeeded Grover Cleveland Winbush as night marshal after Grover Cleveland retired after what Ratliff called his eye trouble , waiting at the corner yelling at Matt at the same time he was jumping far enough back not to be run over . And on Sunday through the Square , the cut-out going full blast and Mr Buck Connors , the day marshal , holleringafter him . And now he  --  Matt  --  had a girl with him , a country girl he had found somewhere , the racer rushing and roaring through the back streets into the last one , to rush slow and loud past Linda 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway desire orp196maybe just frustration possible in Jefferson was an automobilecut-out ; the sole single manifestation which love or anyway desire was capable of assuming in Jefferson , was rushing slow past the specific house with the cut-out wide open , so that he or she would have to know who was passing no matter how hard they worked at not looking out the window . Though by that time Mr Connors had sent for the sheriff himself . He  --  Mr Connors  --  said his first idea was to wake up Otis Harker to come back to town and help him but when Otis heard that what Mr Connors wanted was to stop that racer , Otis would n't even get out of bed . Later , afterward , somebody asked Matt if he would have run over Mr Hampton too and Matt said  --  he was crying then , he was so mad  --  " Hit him ? Hub Hampton ? Have all them god-damn guts splashed over my paint job ? " Though by then even Mr Hampton was n't needed for the cut-out because Matt went right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ; anyway about midnight that night they telephoned in for Mr Hampton to send somebody out to Caledonia where Matt had had a bad fight with Anse McCallum , one of Mr Buddy McCallum 's boys , until Anse snatched up a fence rail or something and would have killed Matt except that folks caught and held them both while they telephoned for the sheriff and brought them both in to town and locked them in the jail and the next morning Mr Buddy McCallum came in on his cork leg and paid them both out and took them down to the lot behind I.O. Snopes 's mule barn and told Anse : " All right . If you cant be licked fair without picking up a fence rail , I 'm going to take my leg off and whip you with it myself . " So they fought again , without the fence rail this time , with Mr Buddy and a few more men watching them now , and Anse still was n't as good as Matt 's Golden Gloves but he never quit until at last Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and told Anse to wash his face at the trough and then go and get in the car and then said to Matt : " And I reckon the time has come for you to be moving on too . " Except that was n't necessary now either ; the garage said Matt was already fired and Matt said , " Fired , hell . I quit . Tell that bastard to come down here and say that to my face . " And Mr Hampton was there too by then , tall , with his big belly and his little hard eyes looking down at Matt . " Where the hell is my car ? " Matt said . " It 's at my house , " Mr Hampton said . " I had it brought in this morning . " " Well well , " Matt said . " Too bad , ai nt it ? McCallum came in and sprung me before you had time to sell it and stick the money in your pocket , huh ? What are you going to say when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine ? " " Nothing , son , " Mr Hampton said . " Whenever you want to leave . " " Which is right now , " Matt said . " And when I leave your . . . . ing town , my foot 'll be right down to the floor board on that cut-out too . And you can stick that too , but not in your pocket . What do you think of that ? " " Nothing , son , " Mr Hampton said . " I 'll make a trade with you . Run that cut-out wide open all the way to the county line and then ten feet past it , and I wont let anybody bother you if you 'll promise never to cross it again . " And that was all . That was Monday , trade day ; it was like the whole county was there , had come to town just to stand quiet around the Square and watch Matt cross it for the last time , the paper suitcase he had come to Jeffersonwith on the seat by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and Matt not looking at any of us : just that quiet and silent suspension for the little gaudy car to rush slowly and loudly through , blatant and noisy and defiant yet at the same time lookingp198as ephemeral and innocent and fragile as a child 's toy , a birthday favor , so that looking at it you knew it would probably never get as far as Memphis , let alone Ohio ; on across the Square and into the street which would become the Memphis highway at the edge of town , the sound of the cut-out banging and clattering and echoing between the walls , magnified a thousand times now beyond the mere size and bulk of the frail little machine which producedit ; and we  --  some of us  --  thinking how surely now he would rush slow and roaring for the last time at least past Linda Snopes 's house . But he did n't . He just went on , the little car going faster and faster up the broad street empty too for the moment as if it too had vacated itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town would give way to country , the vernal space of woods and fields where even the defiant uproar of the cut-out would become puny and fade and be at last absorbed . So that was what Father called  --  said to Uncle Gavin  --  one down . And now it was May and already everybody knew that Linda Snopes was going to be the year 's numberonestudent , the class 's valedictorian ; Uncle Gavin slowed us as we approached Wildermark 's and nudged us in to the window , saying , " That one . Just behind the green one . " It was a lady 's fitted travelling case . " That 's for travelling , " Mother said . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " For travelling , " Mother said . " For going away . " " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . " She 's got to get away from here . Get out of Jefferson . " " What 's wrong with Jefferson ? " Mother said . The three of us stood there . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there looking at the fitted feminine case . She did n't talk low or loud : just quiet . " All right , " she said . " What 's wrong with Linda then ? " Uncle Gavin did n't either . " I do nt like waste , " he said . " Everybody should have his chance not to waste . "  | " Or his chance to the right not to waste a young girl ? " Mother said . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " I want her to be happy . Everybody should have the chance to be happy . " " Which she cant possibly do of course just standing still in Jefferson , " Mother said . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . They were not looking at one another . It was like they were not even talking to one another but simply at the two empty reflections in the plate glass , like when you put the written idea into the anonymous and even interchangeable empty envelope , or maybe into the sealed empty bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written thoughts sealed forever at the same moment into two bottles and cast into the sea to float and drift with the tides and the currents on to the cooling world 's end itself , still immune , still intact and inviolate , still ideas and still true and even still facts whether any eye ever saw them again or any other idea ever responded and sprang to them , to be elated or validated or grieved . " The chance and duty and right to see that everybody is happy , whether they deserve it or not or even want it or not , " Mother said . " All right , " Uncle Gavin said . " Sorry I bothered you . Come on . Let 's go home . Mrs Rouncewell can send her a dozen sunflowers . " " Why not ? " Mother said , taking his arm , already turning him , our three reflections turning in the plate glass , back toward the entrance and into the store , Mother in front now across to the luggage department . " I think the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother said . " It 's for Linda Snopes  --  her graduation , " Mother told Miss Eunice Gant , the clerk . " How nice , " Miss Eunice said . " Is Linda going on a trip ? " " Oh yes , " Mother said . " Very likely . At least probablyp200to one of the Eastern girls ' schools next year perhaps . Or so I heard . " " How nice , " Miss Eunice said . " I always say that every young boy and girl should go away from home for at least one year of school in order to learn how the other half lives . " " How true , " Mother said . " Until you do go and see , all you do is hope . Until you actually see for yourself , you never do give up and settle down , do you ? " " Maggie , " Uncle Gavin said . " Give up ? " Miss Eunice said . " Give up hope ? Young people should never give up hope . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt have to . All they have to do is stay young , no matter how long it takes . " " Maggie , " Uncle Gavin said . " Oh , " Mother said , " you want to pay cash for it instead of charge ? All right ; I 'm sure Mr Wildermark wont mind . " So Uncle Gavin took two twenty-dollar bills from his wallet and took out one of his cards and gave it to Mother . " Thank you , " she said . " But Miss Eunice probably has a big one , that will hold all four names . " So Miss Eunice gave her the big card and Mother held out her hand until Uncle Gavin uncapped his pen and gave it to her and we watched her write in the big sprawly hand that still looked like somebody thirteen years old in the ninth grade : Mr and Mrs Charles Mallison Charles Mallison , Jr Mr Gavin Stevensand capped the pen and handed it back to Uncle Gavin and took the card between the thumb and finger of one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll send it out tonight , " Miss Eunice said . " Even if the graduation is n't until next week . It 's such a handsome gift , why should n't Linda have that much more time to enjoy it ? "  | " Yes , " Mother said . " Why should n't she ? " Then we were outside again , our three reflections jumbled into one walking now across the plate glass ; Mother had Uncle Gavin 's arm again . " All four of our names , " Uncle Gavin said . " At least her father wont know a white-headed bachelor sent his **26;10481;TOOLONG a fitted travelling case . " " Yes , " Mother said . " One of them wont know it . "  |p202The  difficulty was , how to tell her , explain to her . I mean , why . Not the deed , the act itself , but the reason for it , the why behind it  --  say point blank to her over one of the monstrous synthetic paradoxes which were her passion or anyway choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street itself : " We wont meet any more from now on because after Jefferson assimilates all the details of how your boy-friend tracked you down in my office and bloodied my nose one Saturday , and eight days later , having spent his last night in Jefferson in the county jail , shook our dust forever from his feet with the turbulent uproar of his racer 's cut-out  --  after that , for you to be seen still meeting me in ice-cream dens will completely destroy what little was left of your good name . " You see ? That was it : the very words reputation and good name . Merely to say them , speak them aloud , give their existence vocal recognition , would irrevocably soil and besmirch them , would destroy the immunity of the very things they represented , leaving them not just vulnerablebut already doomed ; from the inviolable and proud integrity of principles they would become , reduce to , the ephemeral and already doomed and damned fragility of human conditions ; innocence and virginity become symbol and postulant of loss and grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past tense was and now is not , no more no more . That was the problem . Because the act , the deed itself , was simple enough . Luckily the affair happened late on a Saturday afternoon , which would give my face thirty-six hours anyway before it would have to make a public appearance . ( It would n't have needed that long except for the ring he wore  --  a thing not quite as large as a brass knuckle and not really noticeably unlike gold if you didn'tp203get too close probably , of a tiger 's head gripping between its jaws what had been  --  advisedly  --  a ruby ; advisedly because the fact that the stone was missing at the moment was a loss only to my lip . Besides , the drugstore meetings were not even a weekly affair , let alone daily , so even a whole week could pass before ( 1 ) it would occur to someone that we had not met in over a week , who ( 2 ) would immediately assume that we had something to conceal was why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) the fact that we had met again after waiting over a week only proved it . By which time I was even able to shave past my cut lip . So it was very simple ; simple indeed in fact , and I the simple one . I had planned it like this : the carefully timed accident which would bring me out the drugstore door , the ( say ) tin of pipe tobacco still in plain sight on its way to the pocket , at the exact moment when she would pass on her way to school : " Good morning , Linda  --  " already stepping on past her and then already pausing : " I have another book for you . Meet me here after school this afternoon and we 'll have a Coke over it . " Which would be all necessary . Because I was the simple one , to whom it had never once occurred that the blow of that ruby-vacant reasonably almost-gold tiger 's head might have marked her too even if it did n't leave a visible cut ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts ; is innocent not because it is impervious and invulnerable to everything , but because it is capable of accepting anything and still remaining innocent ; innocent because it foreknows all and therefore does n't have to fear and be afraid ; the tin of tobacco now in my coat pocket because by this time even it had become noticeable , the last book-burdened stragglers now trotting toward the sound of the first strokes of the school bell and still she had not passed ; obviously I had missed her somehow : either taken my post not soon enough or she had taken another route top204school or perhaps would not leave home for school at all today , for whatever reasons no part of which were the middle-aged bachelor 's pandering her to Jonson and Herrickand Thomas Campion ; crossing  --  I  --  the now-unchildrenedstreet at last , mounting the outside stairs since tomorrow was always tomorrow ; indeed , I could even use the tobacco tin again , provided I did n't break the blue stamp for verity , and opened the screen door and entered the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk nor in the leather client 's one before it but in a straight hard armless one against the bookcase as though she had fled , been driven until the wall stopped her , and turned then , her back against it , not quite sitting in the chair nor quite huddled in it because although her legs , knees were close and rigid and her hands were clasped tight in her lap , her head was still up watching the door and then me with the eyes the McCarron boy had marked her with which at a distance looked as black as her hair until you saw they were that blue so dark as to be almost violet . " I thought . . . " she said . " They  --  somebody said Matt quit his job and left  --  went yesterday . I thought you might . . . " " Of course , " I said . " I always want to see you , " stoppingmyself in time from I 've been waiting over there on the corner until the last bell rang , for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Get up . Get out of here quick . Why did you come here anyway ? Do nt you see this is the very thing I have been lying awake at night with ever since Saturday ? So I merely said what I had bought the can of tobacco which I must now find someone capable or anyway willing to smoke , to give it to , to create the chance to say : " I have another book for you . I forgot to bring it this morning , but I 'll bring it at noon . I 'll wait for you at Christian 's after school and stand you a soda too . Now you 'll have to hurry ; you 're already late . "  |p205I  had not even released the screen door and so had only to open it again , having also in that time in which she crossed the room , space to discard a thousand frantic indecisions : to remain concealed in the office as though I had not been there at all this morning , and let her leave alone ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down them , avuncular and fond ; to walk her to the school itself and wait to see her through the actual door : the family friend snatching the neighbor 's child from the rife midst of truancy and restoring it to duty  --  family friend to Flem Snopes who had no more friends than Blackbeard or Pistol , to Eula Varner who no more had friends than man or woman either would have called them that Messalina and Helen had . So I did all three : waited in the office too long , so that I had to follow down the stairs too fast , and then along the street beside her not far enough either to be unnoticed or forgotten . Then there remained only to suborn my nephew with the dollar bill and the book ; I do nt remember which one ; I do nt believe I even noticed . " Sir ? " Chick said . " I meet her in Christian 's drugstore after school and give her the book and tell her you 'll try to get there but not to wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just give her the book at school and save time ? " " Certainly , " I said . " Why do nt you just give me back the dollar ? " " And buy her a soda , " he said . " Do I have to pay for that out of the dollar ? " " All right , " I said . " Twenty-five cents then . If she takes a banana split you can drink water and make a nickel more . " " Maybe she 'll take a Coke , " he said . " Then I can have one too and still make fifteen cents . " " All right , " I said . " Or suppose she do nt want anything . " " Did n't I say all right ? " I said . " Just do nt let your mother hear you say She dont. ' "  | " Why ? " he said . " Father and Ratliff say she do nt ' all the time , and so do you when you are talking to them . And Ratliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged ' and so do you when you are talking to country people like Ratliff . " " How do you know ? " I said . " I 've heard you . So has Ratliff . " " Why ? Did you tell him to ? " " No sir , " he said . " Ratliff told me . " My rejoinder may have been Wait until you get as old as Ratliff and your father and me and you can too , though I do nt remember . But then , inside the next few months I was to discover myself doing lots of things he was n't old enough yet for the privilege . Which was beside the point anyway now ; now only the afternoon remained : the interminabletime until a few minutes after half past three filled with a thousand indecisions which each fierce succeedingharassment would revise . You see ? She had not only abetted me in making that date with which I would break , wreck , shatter , destroy , slay something , she had even forestalled me in it by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . That is , get it passed , live it down ; the office window as good as any for that and better than most since it looked down on the drugstore entrance , so I had only to lurk there . Not to hear the dismissal bell of course this far away but rather to see them first : the little ones , the infantile inflow and scatter of primer- and first-graders , then the middle-graders boisterousand horsing as to the boys , then the mature ones , juniors and seniors grave with weight and alien with puberty ; and there she was , tall ( no : not for a girl that tall but all right then : tall , like a heron out of a moil of frogs and tadpoles ) , pausing for just one quick second at the drugstore entrance for one quick glance , perhaps at the empty stairway . Then she entered , carrying three books any one of which might have been that book and Ip207thought He gave it to her at school ; the damned little devil has foxed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he entered too , carrying the book , and then I thought how if I had only thought to fill a glass with water , to count off slowly sixty seconds , say , to cover the time Skeets McGowan , the soda squirt , would need to tear his fascinations from whatever other female junior or senior and fill the order , then drink the water slowly to simulate the Coke ; thinking But maybe she did take the banana split ; maybe there is still time , already across the office , the screen door already in my hand before I caught myself : at least the County Attorney must not be actually seen running down his office stairs and across the street into a drugstore where a sixteen-year-old highschooljunior waited . And I was in time but just in time . They had not even sat down , or if they had she had already risen , the two of them only standing beside the table , she carrying four books now and looking at me for only that one last instant and then no more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you knew better . " I 'm sorry I 'm late , " I said . " I hope Chick told you . " " It 's all right , " she said . " I have to go on home anyway . " " Without a Coke even ? " I said . " I have to go home , " she said . " Another time then , " I said . " What they call a rain check . " " Yes , " she said . " I have to go home now . " So I moved so she could move , making the move first to let her go ahead , toward the door . " Remember what you said about that quarter , " Chick said . And made the next move first too , opening the screen for her then stopping in it and so establishing severance and separation by that little space before she even knew it , not even needing to pause and half-glance back top208prove herself intact and safe , intact and secure and unthreatenedstill , not needing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even anything to need to say Thank you for , nor even to look back then although she did . " Thank you for the book , " she said ; and gone . " Remember what you said about that quarter , " Chick said . " Certainly , " I said . " Why the bejesus do nt you go somewhere and spend it ? " Oh yes , doing a lot of things Chick was n't old enough yet himself to do . Because dodging situations which might force me to use even that base shabby lash again was fun , excitement . Because she did n't know ( Must not know , at least not now , not yet : else why the need for that base and shabby lash ? ) , could not be certainly sure about that afternoon , that one or two or three ( whatever it was ) minutes in the drugstore ; never sure whether what Chick told her was the truth : that I actually was going to be late and had simply sent my nephew as the handiest messenger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up , I so aged and fatuous as not even to realise the insult either standing her up would be , or sending a ten-year-old boy to keep her company and believing that she , a sixteen-year-old high-school junior , would accept him ; or if I had done it deliberately : made the date then sent the ten-year-old boy to fill it as a delicate way of saying Stop bothering me . So I must not even give her a chance to demand of me with the temerity of desperation which of these was right . And that was the fun , the excitement . I mean , dodging her . It was adolescence in reverse , turned upside down : the youth , himself virgin and  --  who knew ?  --  maybe even more so , at once drawn and terrified of what draws him , contriving by clumsy and timorous artifice the accidental encounters in which he still would not and never quite touch , would not even hope to touch , really want to touch , too terrified in fact to touch ; but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which laved the mistress 's moving limbs ; to whom the glove or the handkerchiefshe did n't even know she had lost , the flower she did n't even know she had crushed , the very ninth- or tenthgradearithmetic or grammar or geography bearing her name in her own magical hand on the flyleaf , are more terrible and moving than ever will be afterward the gleam of the actual naked shoulder or spread of unbound hair on the pillow 's other twin . That was me : not to encounter ; continuously just to miss her yet never be caught at it . You know : in a little town of three thousand people like ours , the only thing that could cause more talk and notice than a middle-aged bachelor meeting a sixteen-year-old maiden two or three times a week would be a sixteen-year-old maiden and a middle-aged bachelor just missing each other two or three times a week by darting into stores or up alleys . You know : a middle-aged lawyer , certainly the one who was County Attorney too , could always find enough to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being on the one street between her home and the school house at eight-thirty and twelve and one and three-thirty oclock when the town 's whole infant roster must come and go , sometimes , a few times even , but not forever . Yet that 's what I had to do . I had no help , you see ; I could n't stop her suddenly on the street one day and say , " Answer quickly now . Exactly how much were you fooled or not fooled that afternoon in the drugstore ? Say in one word exactly what you believed about that episode . " All I could do was leave well enough alone , even when the only well enough I had was n't anywhere that well . So I had to dodge her . I had to plan not just mine but Yoknapatawpha County 's business too ahead in order to dodge a sixteen-year-old girl . That was during the spring . So until school was out in May it would be comparatively simple , at least for five days of the week . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline on her ; and observation even if not personal experience had long since taught me that anyone sixteen years old not nursing a child or supporting a family or in jail could be almost anywhere at any time during the twenty-four hours . So when the time came , which was that last summer before her final year in high school when she would graduate , I did n't even have the catalogues and brochures from the alien and outland schools sent first to me in person , to be handed by me to her , but sent direct to her , to Miss Linda Snopes , Jefferson , Mississippi , the Mississippi to be carefully spelt out in full else the envelope would go : first , to Jefferson , Missouri ; second , to every other state in the forty-eight which had a Jefferson in it , before : third , it would finally occur to somebody somewhere that there might be someone in Mississippi capable of thinking vaguely of attending an Eastern or Northern school or capable of having heard of such or anyway capable of enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , provided they were accompanied by photographs . So I had them sent direct to her  --  the shrewd suave snobenticementsfrom the Virginia schools at which Southern mothers seemed to aim their daughters by simple instinct , I do nt know why , unless because the mothers themselves did not attend them , and thus accomplishing by proxy what had been denied them in person since they had not had mothers driven to accomplish vicariously what they in their turn had been denied . And not just the Virginia ones first but the ones from the smart " finishing " schools north of Mason 's and Dixon 's too . I was being fair . No : we were being fair , she and I both , the two of us who never met any more now for the sake of her good name , in federation and cahoots for the sake of her soul ; the two of us together saying in absentiap211to her mother : There they all are : the smart ones , the snob ones . We have been fair , we gave you your chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where you can help us go , if not by approval , at least by not saying no ; arranging for the other catalogues to reach her only then : the schools which would not even notice what she wore and how she walked and used her fork and all the rest of how she looked and acted in public because by this time all that would be too old and fixed to change , but mainly because it had not mattered anyway , since what did matter was what she did and how she acted in the spirit 's inviolable solitude . So now  --  these last began to reach her about Christmas time of that last year in high school  --  she would have to see me , need to see me , not to help her decide which one of them but simply to discuss , canvass the decision before it became final . I waited , in fact quite patiently while it finally dawned on me that she was not going to make the first gesture to see me again . I had avoided her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been dodging her since in a town the size of ours a male can no more avoid a female consistently for that long by mere accident than they can meet for that long by what they believed or thought was discretion and surreptition , even she realised by this time that that business in Christian 's drugstore that afternoon last April had been no clumsy accident . ( Oh yes , it had already occurred to me also that she had no reason whatever to assume I knew she had received the catalogues , let alone had instigated them . But I dismissed that as immediately as you will too if we are to get on with this . ) So I must make that first gesture . It would not be quite as simple now as it had used to be . A little after half past three on any weekend afternoon I could see her from the officewindow ( if I happened to be there ) pass along the Square in the school 's scattering exodus . Last year , in fact during all the time before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , during this past one , particularly since the Levitt troglodyte 's departure , she would be with another girl who lived on the same street . Then suddenly ( it began in the late winter , about St. Valentine 's Day ) instead of two there would be four of them : two boys , Chick said the Rouncewell boy and the youngest Bishop one , the year 's high-school athletic stars . And now , after spring began , the four of them would be on almost any afternoon in Christian'sdrugstore ( at least there harbored apparently there no ghosts to make her blush and squirm and I was glad of that ) , with Coca-Colas and the other fearsome ( I was acquainted there ) messes which young people , young women in particular , consume with terrifying equanimity not only in the afternoon but at nine and ten in the morning too : which  --  the four of them  --  I had taken to be two pairs , two couples in the steadfast almost uxorious fashion of high-school juniors and seniors , until one evening I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show squired by both of them . Which would make it a little difficult now . But not too much . In fact , it would be quite simple ( not to mention the fact that it was already May and I could n't much longer afford to wait ) : merely to wait for some afternoon when she would be without her convoy , when the Bishop and the Rouncewell would have to practice their dedications or maybe simply be kept in by a teacher after school . Which I did , already seeing her about a block away but just in time to see her turn suddenly into a street which would by-pass the Square itself : obviously a new route home she had adopted to use on the afternoons when she was alone , was already or ( perhaps ) wanted to be . But that was simple too : merely to back-track one block then turn myself one block more to the corner where the street she was in must intercept . But quicker than she , faster than she , so that I saw her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading platformsp213until she saw me at the corner and stopped in dead midstrideand one quick fleeing half-raised motion of the hand . So that , who knows ? At that sudden distance I might not have even stopped , being already in motion again , raising my hand and arm in return and on , across the alley , stridingon as you would naturally expect a county attorney to be striding along a side street at forty-two minutes past three in the afternoon ; one whole block more for safety and then safe , inviolate still the intactness , unthreatened again . There was the telephone of course . But that would be too close , too near the alley and the raised hand . And griiss Gott they had invented the typewriter ; the Board of Supervisors could subtract the letterhead from my next pay check or who knows they might not even miss it ; the typewriter and the time of course were already mine : Dear Linda : When you decide which one you like the best , let 's have a talk . I 've seen some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue may have . We should have a banana split too ; they may not have heard of them yet at Bennington and Bard and Swarthmore and you 'll have to be a missionary as well as a student . Then in pencil , in my hand : Saw you in the alley the other afternoon but did n't have time to stop . Incidentally , what were you doing in an alley ? You see ? The other afternoon , so that it would n't matter when I mailed it : two days from now or two weeks from now ; two whole weeks in which to tear it up , and even addressed the stamped envelope , knowing as I did so that I was deliberately wasting two  --  no , three , bought singly  --  whole cents , then tore them neatly across once and matched the torn edges and tore them across again and built ap214careful small tepee on the cold hearth and struck a match and watched the burn and uncreaked mine ancient knees and shook my trousers down . Because it was May now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eunice Gant had promised to send the dressing case yesterday afternoon and grass Gott they had invented the telephone too . So once more ( this would be the last one , the last lurk ) to wait until half past eight o'clock ( the bank would not open until nine but then even though Flem was not president of it you simply declined to imagine him hanging around the house until the last moment for the chance to leap to the ringing telephone ) and then picked it up : " Good morning , Mrs Snopes . Gavin Stevens . May I speak to Linda if she has n't already . . . I see , I must have missed her . But then I was late myself this morning .. . Thank you . We are all happy to know the dressing case pleased her . Maggie will be pleased to have the note .. . If you 'll give her the message when she comes home to dinner . I have some information about a Radcliffe scholarshipwhich might interest her . That 's practically Harvard too and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you will : that I 'll be waiting for her in the drugstore after school this afternoon . Thank you . " And good-bye . The sad word , even over the telephone . I mean , not the word is sad nor the meaning of it , but that you really can say it , that the time comes always in time when you can say it without grief and anguish now but without even the memory of grief and anguish , remembering that night in this same office here ( when was it ? ten years ago ? twelve years ? ) when I had said not just Goodbyebut Get the hell out of here to Eula Varner , and no hair bleached , no bead of anguished sweat or tear sprang out , and what regret still stirred a little was regret that even if I had been brave enough not to say No then , even that courage would not matter now since even the cowardice was only thin regret.  |p215At  first I thought I would go inside and be already sitting at the table waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taken-for-granted casual . So I stood at the entrance , but back , not to impede the juvenile flood or perhaps rather not to be trampled by it . Because she must not see me from a block away waiting , but casual , by accident outwardly and chance : first the little ones , firstandsecond- and third-grade ; and now already the larger ones , the big grades and the high school ; it would be soon now , any time now . Except that it was Chick , with a folded note . " Here , " he said . " It seems to be stuck . " " Stuck ? " I said . " The record . The victrola . This is the same tune it was playing before , ai nt it ? Just backward this time . " Because she probably had insisted he read it first before she released it to him . So I was the second , not counting her : Dear Mr StevensI will have to be a little late if you can wait for me Linda " Not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt hear any dollar now . " " Okay , " he said . " Neither did I. I reckon you ai nt coming home now . " " So do I , " I said . So I went inside then and sat down at the table ; I owed her that much anyway ; the least I could give her was revenge , so let it be full revenge ; full satisfaction of watching from wherever she would be watchingwhile I sat still waiting for her long after even I knew she would not come ; let it be the full whole hour then since " finis " is not " good-bye " and has no cause to grieve the spring of grief . So when she passed rapidly across the plate-glass window , I did n't know her . Because she was approaching not from the direction of the school but from the opposite one ,  |p216as  though she were on her way to school , not from it . No : that was not the reason . She was already in the store now , rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the same physical sense both running and poised motionless , wearing not the blouse and skirt or print cotton dress above the flat-heeled shoes of school ; but dressed , I mean " dressed , " in a hat and high heels and silk stockings and makeup who needed none and already I could smell the scent : one poised split-second of immobilisedand utter flight in bizarre and paradox panoply of allure , like a hawk caught by a speed lens . " It 's all right , " I said . Because at least I still had that much presence . " I cant , " she said . At least that much presence . There were not many people in the store but even one could have been too many , so I was already up now , moving toward her . " How nice you look , " I said . " Come on ; I 'll walk a way with you , " and turned her that way , not even touching her arm , on and out , onto the pavement , talking ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking : which was perhaps why I did not even realise that she had chosen the direction , not in fact until I realised that she had actually turned toward the foot of the office stairs , only then touching her : her elbow , holding it a little , on past the stairs so that none ( one hoped intended must believe ) had marked that falter , on along the late spring storefronts  --  the hardware and farm-furnish stores cluttered with garden and farm tools and rolls of uncut plow-line and sample sacks of slag and fertilizer and even the grocery ones exposing neat cases of seed packets stencilled with gaudy and incredible vegetables and flowers  --  talking ( oh ay , trust me always ) sedate and decorous : the young girl decked and scented to go wherever a young woman would be going at four oclock on a May afternoon , and the gray-headed bachelor , avuncularand what old Negroes called " settled , " incapable nowp217of harm , slowed the blood and untroubled now the flesh by turn of wrist or ankle , faint and dusty-dry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could turn a corner into privacy or at least room or anyway so long as we did not actually stop . " I cant , " she said . " You said that before , " I said . " You cant what ? " " The schools , " she said . " The ones you . . . . the catalogues . From outside Jefferson , outside Mississippi . " " I 'm glad you cant , " I said . " I did n't expect you to decide alone . That 's why I wanted to see you : to help you pick the right one . " " But I cant , " she said . " Do nt you understand ? I cant . " Then I  --  yes , I  --  stopped talking . " All right , " I said . " Tell me . " " I cant go to any of them . I 'm going to stay in Jefferson . I 'm going to the Academy next year . " Oh yes , 1 stopped talking now . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even that the Academy was in Jefferson that mattered . It was Jefferson itself which was the mortal foe since Jefferson was Snopes . " I see , " I said . " All right . I 'll talk to her myself . " " No , " she said . " No . I do nt want to go away . " " Yes , " I said . " We must . It 's too important . It 's too important for even you to see now . Come on . We 'll go home now and talk to your mother  --  " already turning . But already she had caught at me , grasping my wrist and forearmwith both hands , until I stopped . Then she let go and just stood there in the high heels and the silk stockings and the hat that was a little too old for her or maybe I was not used to her in a hat or maybe the hat just reminded me of the only other time I ever saw her in a hat which was that fiasco of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I compelled , forced her to do something because she did n't know how to refuse ; whereuponI said suddenly : " Of course I do nt really need to askp218you this , but maybe we 'd better just for the record . You do nt really want to stay in Jefferson , do you ? You really do want to go up East to school ? " then almost immediately said : " All right , I take that back . I cant ask you that ; I cant ask you to say outright you want to go against your mother .  --  All right , " I said , " you do nt want to be there yourself when I talk to her : is that it ? " Then I said : " Look at me , " and she did , with the eyes that were not blue or gray either but hyacinthine , the two of us standing there in the middle of that quiet block in full view of at least twenty discreet window-shades ; looking at me even while she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come on , " I said . " Let 's walk again , " and she did so , docile enough . " She knows you came to meet me this afternoonbecause of course she gave you my telephone message .  --  Allright , " I said . " I 'll come to your house in the morning then , after you 've left for school . But it 's all right ; you do nt need to tell her . You do nt need to tell her anything  --  sayanything  --  " Not even No No again , since she had said nothing else since I saw her and was still saying it even in the way she walked and said nothing . Because now I knew why the clothes , the scent , the makeup which belonged on her no more than the hat did . It was desperation , not to defend the ingratitude but at least to palliate the rudeness of it : the mother who said Certainly , meet him by all means . Tell him I am quite competent to plan my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his nose out of it ; the poor desperate child herself covering , trying to hide the baseness of the one and the shame of the other behind the placentae of worms and the urine and vomit of cats and cancerous whales . " I 'll come tomorrowmorning , after you 've gone to school , " I said . " I know . I know . But it 's got too important now for either of us to stop . " So the next morning : who  --  I  --  had thought yesterdayp219to have seen the last of lurking . But I had to be sure . And there was Ratliff . " What ? " he said . " You 're going to see Eula because Eula wont let her leave Jefferson to go to school ? You 're wrong . " " All right , " I said . " I 'm wrong . I do nt want to do it either . I 'm not that brave  --  offering to tell anybody , let alone a woman , how to raise her child . But somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here . Away for good from all the very air that ever heard or felt breathed the name of Snopes  --  " " But wait , I tell you ! Wait ! " he said . " Because you 're wrong  --  " But I could n't wait . Anyway , I did n't . I mean , I just deferred , marked time until at least nine oclock . Because even on a hot Mississippi May morning , when people begin to get up more or less with the sun , not so much in self-defense as to balance off as much as possible of the day against the hours between noon and four , a housewife would demand a little time to prepare ( her house and herselfor perhaps most of all and simply , her soul ) for a male caller not only uninvited but already unwelcome . But she was prepared , self , house and soul too ; if her soul was ever in her life unready for anything that just wore pants or maybe if any woman 's soul ever needed prereadyingand pre-arming against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little rented ( still looking rented even though the owner or somebody had painted it ) gate up the short rented walk toward the little rented veranda and onto it , my hand already lifted to knock before I saw her through the screen , standing there quite still in the little hallway watching me . " Good morning , " she said . " Come in , " and now with no screen between us still watching me . No : just looking at me , not brazenly , not with welcome , not with anything . Then she turned , the hair , where all the other women inp220Jefferson , even Maggie , had bobbed theirs now , still one heavy careless yellow bun at the back of her head , the dress which was not a morning gown nor a hostess gown nor even a house dress but just a simple cotton dress that was simply a dress and which , although she was thirtyfivenow  --  yes : thirty-six now by Ratliff 's counting from that splendid fall  --  like that one when she first crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as snatching in desperate haste to hide them but rather to spring in suppliance and adulation to the moving limbs , the very flowing of the fabric 's laving folds crying Evoe ! Evoe ! Oh yes , it was a sitting room , exactly like the hall and both of them exactly like something else I had seen somewherebut did n't have time to remember . Because she said , " Will you have some coffee ? " and I saw that too : the service ( not silver but the stuff the advertisements do nt tell you is better than silver but simply newer . New : implying that silver is quite all right and even proper for people still thrall to gaslight and the horse-and-buggy ) on a low table , with two chairs already drawn up and I thought I have lost even if she had met me wearing a barrel or a feed sack . Then I thought So it really is serious , since this  --  the coffee , the low table , the two intimate chairs  --  was an assault not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul or at least the soul which believes it thirsts to be civilised . " Thank you , " I said and waited and then sat too . " Only , do you mind if I wonder why ? We do nt need an armistice , since I have already been disarmed . " " You came to fight then , " she said , pouring . " How can I , without a weapon ? " I said , watching : the bent head with the careless , almost untidy bun of hair , the arm , the hand which could have rocked a warrior-hero 's cradle or even caught up its father 's fallen sword , pouring the trivial ( it would probably not even be very good coffee )  |p221fluid  from the trivial spurious synthetic urn  --  this , in that room , that house ; and suddenly I knew where I had seen the room and hallway before . In a photograph , the photographfrom say Town and Country labelled American Interior , reproduced in color in a wholesale furniture catalogue , with the added legend : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our own Model scaled to your individual Requirements . " Thank you , " I said . " No cream . Just sugar .  --  Only it does n't look like you . " " What ? " she said . " This room . Your house . " And that was why I did n't even believe at first that I had heard her . " It was n't me . It was my husband . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " My husband chose this furniture . " " Flem ? " I said , cried . " Flem Snopes ? "  --  and she looking at me now , not startled , amazed : not anything or if anything , just waiting for my uproar to reach its end : nor was it only from McCarron that Linda got the eyes , but only the hair from him . " Flem Snopes ! " I said . " Flem Snopes ! " " Yes . We went to Memphis . He knew exactly what he wanted . No , that 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted , had to have . Or does that make any sense to you ? " " Yes , " I said . " Terribly . You went to Memphis . " " Yes , " she said . " That was why : to find somebody who could tell him what he had to have . He already knew which store he was going to . The first thing he said was , When a man do nt intend to buy anything from you , how much do you charge him just to talk ? ' Because he was not trading now , you see . When you 're on a trade , for land or stock or whatever it is , both of you may trade or both of you may not , it all depends ; you do nt have to buy it or sell it ; when you stop trading and part , neither of you may be any different from when you began . But not this time . This was something he had to have and knew he had to have :  |p222he  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only have to depend on the man who owned it to tell him what he wanted , he would even have to depend on the man sellingit not to cheat him on the price or the value of it because he would n't know that either : only that he had to have it . Do you understand that too ? " " All right , " I said . " Yes . And then ? " " It had to be exactly what it was , for exactly what he was . That was when the man began to say , Yes , I think I see . You started out as a clerk in a country store . Then you moved to town and ran a cafe . Now you 're vice president of your bank . A man who came that far in that short time is not going to stop just there , and why should n't everybody that enters his home know it , see it ? Yes , I know what you want . ' And Flem said No . Not expensive , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right , ' the man said . Antique then , ' and took us into a room and showed us what he meant . I can take this piece here for instance and make it look still older . ' And Flem said , Why ? ' and the man said , For background . Your grandfather . ' And Flem said , I had a grandfather because everybody had . I do nt know who he was but I know that whoeverhe was he never owned enough furniture for a room , let alone a house . Besides , I do nt aim to fool anybody . Only a fool would try to fool smart people , and anybody that needs to fool fools is already one . ' And that was when the man said wait while he telephoned . And we did , it was not long before a woman came in . She was his wife . She said to me : What are your ideas ? ' and I said , I do nt care , ' and she said What ? ' and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched them looking at one another , a good while . Then she said , not loud like her husband , quite quiet : I know , ' and now it was Flem that said , Wait . Now much will it cost ? ' and she said , You 're a trader . I 'll make a trade with you . I 'll bring the stuff down to Jefferson and put it in your house myself . If you like it ,  |p223you  buy it . If you do nt like it , I 'll load it back up and move it back here and it wont cost you a cent . ' " " All right , " I said . " And then ? " " That 's all , " she said . " Your coffee 's cold . I 'll get another cup  --  " and began to rise until I stopped her . " When was this ? " I said . " Four years ago , " she said . " When he bought this house . " " Bought the house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when he became vice president of the bank ! " " Yes , " she said . " The day before it was announced . I 'll get another cup . " " I do nt want coffee , " I said , sitting there saying Flem Snopes Flem Snopes until I said , cried : " I do nt want anything ! I 'm afraid ! " until I finally said " What ? " and she repeated : " Will you have a cigarette ? " and I saw that too : a synthetic metal box also and there should have been a syntheticmatching lighter but what she had taken from the same box with the cigarette was a kitchen match . " Linda says you smoke a corncob pipe . Smoke it if you want to . " " No , " I said again . " Not anything .  --  But Flem Snopes , " I said . " Flem Snopes . " " Yes , " she said . " It 's not me that wont let her go away from Jefferson to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? When she 's not even his  --  he 's not even her  --  I 'm sorry . But you can see how urgent , how we do nt even have time for .... " " Politeness ? " she said . Nor did I make that move either : just sitting there watching while she leaned and scratched the match on the sole of her side-turned slipper and lit the cigarette . " For anything , " I said . " For anything except her . Ratliff tried to tell me this this morning , but I would n't listen . So maybe that 's what you were telling me a moment ago when I would n't or did n't listen ? The furniture . That day in thep224store . Did n't know what he wanted because what he wanted did n't matter , was n't important : only that he did want it , did need it , must have it , intended to have it no matter what cost or who lost or who anguished or grieved . To be exactly what he needed to exactly fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was announced : a vice president'swife and child along with the rest of the vice president'sfurniture in the vice president 's house ? Is that what you tried to tell me ? " " Something like that , " she said . " Just something like that , " I said . " Because that 's not enough . It 's nowhere near enough . We wont mention the money because everybody who ever saw that bow tie would know he would n't pay out his own money to send his own child a sleeper-ticket distance to school , let alone another man 's ba  --  " and stopped . But not she , smoking , watching the burning tip of cigarette . " Say it , " she said . " Bastard . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Why ? " she said . " I 'm trying , " I said . " Maybe I could , if only you were . Looked like you were . Or even like you were trying to be . " " Go on , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he  --  you  --  could get that from Uncle Will probably , not to mention taking it from me as a scholarship . Or is that it ? He cant even bear to see the money of even a mortal enemy like old man Will Varner probably is to him wasted on sending a child out of the state to school when he pays taxes every year to support the Mississippi ones ? " " Go on , " she said again . " Not the money . " " So it is that furniture catalogue picture after all , scaled in cheap color from the Charleston or Richmond or Long Island or Boston photograph , down to that one which Flem Snopes holds imperative that the people of Yoknapatawpha County must have of him . While he was just owner of a back-alley cafe it was all right for all Frenchman 's Bend ( and all Jefferson and the rest of the county too after Ratliff and a few others like him got through with it ) to know that the child who bore his name was really a  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " I said . But even then I did n't say it : "  --  and even when he sold the cafe for a nice profit and was superintendent of the power-plant , it still would n't have mattered . And even after that when he held no public position but was simply a private usurer and property-grabber quietly minding his own business ; not to mention the fact that ten or twelve years had now passed , by which time he could even begin to trust Jefferson to have enough tenderness for a twelve- or thirteen-year-old female child not to upset her life with that useless and gratuitous information . But now he is vice president of a bank and now a meddling outsideris persuading the child to go away to school , to spend at least the three months until the Christmas holidays among people none of whose fathers owe him money and so must keep their mouths shut , any one of whom might reveal the fact which at all costs he must now keep secret . So that 's it , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking quietly and steadily while she watched the slow curl and rise of the smoke . " So it 's you , after all , " I said . " He forbade her to leave Jefferson , and blackmailed you into supporting him by threatening you with what he himself is afraid of : that he himself will tell her of her mother 's shame and her own illegitimacy . Well , that 's a blade with three edges . Ask your father for the money , or take it from me , and get her away from Jefferson or I 'll tell her myself who she is  --  or is not . " " Do you think she will believe you ? " she said . " What ? " I said . " Believe me ? Believe me ? Even without a mirror to look into , nothing to compare with and need to repudiate from , since all she needed was just to live with him for the seventeen years which she has . What more could she want than to believe me , believe anyone , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his child ? What are you talking about ?

And if that were not enough , what more could anybody want than this , that most never have the chance to be , not one in ten million have the right to be , deserve to be : not just a love child but one of the elect to share cousinhood with the world 's immortal love-children  --  fruit of that brave virgin passion not just capable but doomed to count the earth itself well lost for love , which down all the long record of man the weak and impotent and terrified and sleepless that the rest of the human race calls its poets , have dreamed and anguished and exulted and amazed over  --  " and she watching me now , not smoking : just holding the poised cigarette while the last blue vapor faded , watching me through it .

" " You mean she will take . . . this  --  him  --  in preference to nothing ? Will throw away the chance for school and everything else ? I do nt believe you . " " To her , this is n't nothing . She will take it before a lot of things . Before most things . " " I do nt believe you ! " I said , cried , or thought I did . Butonly thought it , until I said : " So there 's nothing I can do .

Right now , in the middle of all this , she wont know how to say No . Marry her . " " Good-bye , " I said . " Good-bye . " And Ratliff again , still in the client 's chair where I had left him an hour ago . " I tried to tell you , " he said . " Of course it 's Flem . What reason would Eula and that gal have not to jump at a chance to be shut of each other for nine or ten months for a change ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Flem Snopes is vice president of a bank now with a vice president 's house with vice president 's furniture in it and some of that vice president 's furniture has got to be a vice president 's wife and child . " " No , " he said . " All right , " I said . " The vice president of a bank do nt dare have it remembered that his wife was already carrying somebody else 's bastard when he married her , so if she goes off to school some stranger that do nt owe him money will tell her who she is and the whole playhouse will blow up . " " No , " Ratliff said . " All right , " I said . " Then you tell a while . " " He 's afraid she 'll get married , " he said . " What ? " I said . " That 's right , " he said . " When Jody was born , Uncle Billy Varner made a will leaving half of his property to Miz Varner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a new will leaving that same first half to Miz Varner and the other half split in two equal parts , one for Jody and one for Eula . That 's the will he showed Flem that day him and Eula was married and he ai nt changed it since . That is , Flem Snopes believed him when he said he was n't goingp228to change it , whether anybody else believed him or not  --  especially after Flem beat him on that Old Frenchman place trade . " " What ? " I said . " He gave that place to them as Eula 's dowry . " " Sho , " Ratliff said . " It was told around so because Uncle Billy was the last man of all that would have corrected it . He offered Flem the place but Flem said he would rather have the price of it in cash money . Which was why Flem and Eula was a day late leaving for Texas : him and Uncle Billy was trading , with Uncle Billy beating Flem down to where he never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would take that figger provided Uncle Billy would give him a option to buy the place at the same amount when he come back from Texas . So they agreed , and Flem come back from Texas with them paint ponies and when the dust finally settled , me and Henry Armstid had done bought that Old Frenchman place from Flem for my half of that restaurant and enough of Henry 's cash money to pay off Uncle Billy 's option , which he had done forgot about . And that 's why Flem Snopes at least knows that Uncle Billy ai nt going to change that will . So he do nt dare risk letting that girl leave Jefferson and get married , because he knows that Eula will leave him too then . It was Flem started it by saying No , but you got all three of them against you , Eula and that girl too until that girl finds the one she wants to marry . Because women ai nt interested  --  " " Wait , " I said , " wait . It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women because things like love and morality and jumping at any chance you can find that will keep you from being a Snopes are just a poet 's romantic dream and women are n't interested in the romance of dreams ; they are interested in the reality of facts , they do nt care what facts , let alone whether they are true or not if they just dovetail with all the other facts without leaving a saw-tooth edge . Right ? "  | " Well , " he said , " I might not a put it jest exactly that way . " " Because I do nt know anything about women , " I said . " So would you mind telling me how the hell you learned ? " " Maybe by listening , " he said . Which we all knew , since what Yoknapatawphian had not seen at some time during the past ten or fifteen years the tin box shaped and painted to resemble a house and containing the demonstrator machine , in the old days attached to the back of a horse-drawn buckboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitched or parked beside the gate to a thousand yards on a hundred back-country roads , while , surrounded by a group of four or five or six ladies come in sunbonnets or straw hats from anywhere up to a mile along the road , Ratliff himself with his smooth brown bland inscrutable face and his neat faded tieless blue shirt , sitting in a kitchen chair in the shady yard or on the gallery , listening . Oh yes , we all knew that . " So I did n't listen to the right ones , " I said . " Or the wrong ones neither , " he said . " You never listened to nobody because by that time you were already talking again . " Oh yes , easy . All I had to do was stand there on the street at the right time , until she saw me and turned , ducked with that semblance of flight , into the side street which would by-pass the ambush . Nor even then to back-track that one block but merely to go straight through the drugstore itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how fast she went I was in the alley first , ambushed again behind the wall 's angle in ample time to hear her rapid feet and then step out and grasp her arm just above the wrist almost before it began to rise in that reflex of flight and repudiation , holding the wrist , not hard , while she wrenched , jerked faintly at it , saying , " Please . Please . "  | " All right , " I said . " All right . Just tell me this . When you went home first and changed before you met me in the drugstore that afternoon . It was your idea to go home first and change to the other dress . But it was your mother who insisted on the lipstick and the perfume and the silk stockingsand the high heels . Is n't that right ? " And she still wrenching and jerking faintly at the arm I held , whispering : " Please . Please . "  |p231This  is what Ratliff said happened up to where Uncle Gavin could see it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog . Old Het ran in Mrs Hait 's front door and down the hall into the kitchen , already hollering in her strong bright happy voice , with strong and childlike pleasure : " Miss Mannie ! Mule in the yard ! " Nobody knew just exactly how old old Het really was . Nobody in Jefferson even remembered just how long she had been in the poorhouse . The old people said she was about seventy , though by her own counting , calculated from the ages of various Jefferson ladies from brides to grandmothers that she claimed to have nursed from infancy , she would be around a hundred and , as Ratliff said , at least triplets . That is , she used the poorhouse to sleep in or anyway pass most or at least part of the night in . Because the rest of the time she was either on the Square or the streets of Jefferson or somewhere on the mile-and-a-half dirt road between town and the poorhouse ; for twenty-five years at least ladies , seeing her through the front window or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house next door , had been locking themselves in the bathroom . But even this did no good unless they had rememberedfirst to lock the front and back doors of the house itself . Because sooner or later they would have to come out and there she would be , tall , lean , of a dark chocolate color , voluble , cheerful , in tennis shoes and the long rat-colored coat trimmed with what forty or fifty years ago had been fur , and the purple toque that old Mrs Compson had given her fifty years ago while General Compson himself was still alive , set on the exact top of her headrag ( at first she had carried a carpetbag of the same color and ap/parently as bottomless as a coal mine , though since the ten-cent store came to Jefferson the carpetbag had given place to a succession of the paper shopping bags which it gave away ) , already settled in a chair in the kitchen , having established already upon the begging visitation a tone blandly and incorrigibly social . She passed that way from house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alarm and consternation as she levied her weekly toll of food scraps and cast-off garmentsand an occasional coin for snuff , moving in an urbane uproar and as inescapable as a tax-gatherer . Though for the last year or two since Mrs Hait 's widowing , Jefferson had gained a sort of temporary respite from her because of Mrs Hait . But even this was not complete . Rather , old Het had merely established a kind of local headquarters or advanced foraging post in Mrs Hait 's kitchen soon after Mr Hait and five mules belonging to Mr I. O. Snopes died on a sharp curve below town under the fast northbound through freight one night and even the folks at the poorhouseheard that Mrs Hait had got eight thousand dollars for him . She would come straight to Mrs Hait 's as soon as she reached town , sometimes spending the entire forenoon there , so that only after noon would she begin her implacablerounds . Now and then when the weather was bad she spent the whole day with Mrs Hait . On these days her regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house of the man-charactered and man-tongued woman who as Ratliff put it had sold her husband to the railroad company for eight thousand percent profit , who chopped her own firewood and milked her cow and plowed and worked her own vegetable garden  --  they wondered if maybe old Het helped with the work in return for her entertainment or if even now she still kept the relationship at its social level of a guest come to divert and be diverted . She was wearing the hat and coat and was carrying the shopping bag when she ran into Mrs Hait 's kitchen , already hollering : " Miss Mannie ! Mule in the yard ! "  |p233Mrs  Hait was squatting in front of the stove , raking live ashes from it into a scuttle . She was childless , living alone now in the little wooden house painted the same color that the railroad company used on its stations and boxcars  --  out of respect to and in memory of , we all said , that morningthree years ago when what remained of Mr Hait had finally been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of new manila rope scattered along the right-of-way . In time the railroad claims adjuster called on her , and in time she cashed a check for eight thousand five hundred dollars , since ( as Uncle Gavin said , these were the halcyon days when even the railroad companies considered their Southern branches and divisions the rightful legitimate prey of all who dwelt beside them ) although for several years before Mr Haft 's death single mules and pairs ( by coincidencebelonging often to Mr Snopes too ; you could always tell his because every time the railroad killed his mules they always had new strong rope on them ) had been in the habit of getting themselves killed on that same blind curve at night , this was the first time a human being had  --  as Uncle Gavin put it  --  joined them in mutual apotheosis . Mrs Hait took the money in cash ; she stood in a calico wrapper and her late husband 's coat sweater and the actual felt hat he had been wearing ( it had been found intact ) on that fatal morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teller then the cashier then the president ( Mr de Spain himself ) tried to explain to her about bonds , then about savings accounts , then about a simple checking account , and put the money into a salt sack under her apron and departed ; that summer she painted her house that serviceable and time-defying color which matched the depot and the boxcars , as though out of sentiment or ( as Ratliff said ) gratitude , and now she still lived in it , alone , in the calico wrapper and the sweater coat and the same felt hat which her husband had owned and worn until he no longer needed them ; though her shoes by this time were her own : men 's shoes which buttoned , with toes like smallp234tulip bulbs , of an archaic and obsolete pattern which Mr Wildermark himself ordered especially for her once a year . She jerked up and around , still clutching the scuttle , and glared at old Het and said  --  her voice was a good strong one too , immediate too " That son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with old Het still carrying the shopping bag and following , ran out of the kitchen into the fog . That 's why it was n't cold : the fog : as if all the sleeping and breathing of Jeffersonduring that whole long January night was still lying there imprisoned between the ground and the mist , keeping it from quite freezing , lying like a scum of grease on the wooden steps at the back door and on the brick coping and the wooden lid of the cellar stairs beside the kitchen door and on the wooden planks which led from the steps to the wooden shed in the corner of the back yard where Mrs Haft 's cow lived ; when she stepped down onto the planks , still carrying the scuttle of live ashes , Mrs Hait skated violently before she caught her balance . Old Het in her rubber soles did n't slip . " Watch out ! " she shouted happily . " They in the front ! " One of them was n't . Because Mrs Hait did n't fall either . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house where , with silent and apparitionlikesuddenness , the mule appeared . It belonged to Mr. I.O. Snopes too . I mean , until they finally unravelled Mr Hait from the five mules on the railroad track that morning three years ago , nobody had connected him with Mr Snopes 's mule business , even though now and then somebody did wonder how Mr Hait did n't seem to need to do anything steady to make a living . Ratliff said the reason was that everybody was wondering too hard about what in the world I.O. Snopes was doing in the livestock business . ' I hough Ratliff said that on second thought maybe it was natural : that back in Frenchman 's Bend I.O. had been a blacksmith without having any business at that , hating horsesp235and mules both since he was deathly afraid of them , so maybe it was natural for him to take up the next thing he would n't have any business in or sympathy or aptitude for , not to mention being six or eight or a dozen times as scared since now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a post and with its owner handy , he would have to deal alone with eight or ten or a dozen of them running loose until he could manage to put a rope on them . That 's what he did though  --  bought his mules at the Memphis market and brought them to Jefferson and sold them to farmers and widows and orphans , black and white , for whatever he could get , down to some last irreducible figure , after which ( up to the night when the freight train caught Mr Hait too and Jefferson made the first connection between Mr Hait and Mr Snopes 's livestock business ) single mules and pairs and gangs ( always tied together with that new strong manila rope which Snopes always itemised and listed in his claim ) would be killed by night freight trains on that same blind curve of Mr Hait 's exit ; somebody ( Ratliffswore it was n't him but the depot agent ) finally sent Snopes through the mail a printed train schedule for the division . Though after Mr Hait 's misfortune ( miscalculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent should have sent the train schedule to , along with a watch ) Snopes 's mules stopped dying of sudden death on the railroad track . When the adjuster came to adjust Mrs Hait , Snopes was there too , which Ratliff said was probably the most terrible decisionSnopes ever faced in his whole life : between the simple prudence which told him to stay completely clear of the railroad company 's investigation , and his knowledge of Mrs Hait which had already told him that his only chance to get any part of that indemnity would be by having the railroad company for his ally . Because he failed . Mrs Hait stated calmly that her husband had been the sole owner of the five mules ; she didn'tp236even have to dare Snopes out loud to dispute it ; all he ever saw of that money ( oh yes , he was there in the bank , as close as he dared get , watching ) was when she crammed it into the salt bag and folded the bag into her apron . For five or six years before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somnolent Jefferson scene in dust and uproar , his approach heralded by forlorn shouts and cries , his passing marked by a yellow cloud of dust filled with the tossing jug-shaped heads and the clattering hooves , then last of all Snopes himself at a panting trot , his face gaped with forlorn shouting and wrung with concern and terror and dismay . When he emerged from his conference with the adjuster he still wore the concern and the dismay , but the terror was now blended into an incredulous , a despairing , a shocked and passionate disbelief which still showed through the new overlay of hungry hope it wore during the next three years ( again , Ratliff said , such a decision and problem as no man should be faced with : who  --  Snopes  --  heretofore had only to unload the mules into the receiving pen at the depot and then pay a Negro to ride the old bell mare which would lead them across town to his sales stable-lot , while now and single-handed he had to let them out of the depot pen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end by Mrs Hait 's small unfenced yard ) when the uproar  --  the dust-cloud filled with plunging demonic shapes  --  would seem to be translated in one single burst across the peaceful edge of Jefferson and into Mrs Hait 's yard , where the two of them , Mrs Hait and Snopes  --  Mrs Hait clutching a broom or a mop or whatever weapon she was able to snatch up as she ran out of the house cursing like a man , and Snopes , vengeance for the moment sated or at least the unbearable top of the unbearable sense of impotence and injustice and wrong taken off ( Ratliff said he had probably long since given up any real belief of actually extorting even one cent of that money from Mrsp237Hait and all that remained now was the raging and baseless hope ) who would now have to catch the animals somehow and get them back inside a fence  --  ducked and dodged among the thundering shapes in a kind of passionate and choreographic pantomime against the backdrop of that house whose very impervious paint Snopes believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chatelaine led a life of queenly and sybaritic luxury on his money ( which according to Ratliff was exactly why Mrs Halt refused to appeal to the law to abate Snopes as a nuisance : this too was just a part of the price she owed for the amazing opportunity to swap her husband for eight thousand dollars )  --  this , while that whole section of town learned to gather  --  the ladies in the peignoirs and boudoir caps of morning , the children playing in the yards , and the people , Negro and white , who happened to be passing at the moment  --  and watch from behind neighboring shades or the security of adjacent fences . When they saw it , the mule was running too , its head high too in a strange place it had never seen before , so that coming suddenly out of the fog and all , it probably looked taller than a giraffe rushing down at Mrs Hait and old Het with the halter-rope whipping about its ears . " Dar hit ! " old Het shouted , waving the shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratliff how Mrs Hait whirled and skidded again on the greasy planks as she and the mule now ran parallel with one another toward the cowshed from whose open door the static and astonished face of the cow now looked out . To the cow , until a second ago standing peacefully in the door chewing and looking at the fog , the mule must have looked taller and more incredible than any giraffe , let alone looking like it aimed to run right through the shed as if it were straw or maybe even pure and simple mirage . Anyway , old Het said the cow snatched her face back inside the shed like a match going out and made a sound inside the shed , old Het did n't know what sound ,  |p238just  a sound of pure shock and alarm like when you pluck a single string on a harp or a banjo , Mrs Hait running toward the sound old Het said in a kind of pure reflex , in automatic compact of female with female against the world of mules and men , she and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hait already swinging the scuttle of live ashes to throw at the mule . Of course it did n't take this long ; old Het said she was still hollering " Dar hit ! Dar hit ! " when the mule swerved and ran at her until she swung the shopping bag and turned it past her and on around the next corner of the house and back into the fog like a match going out too . That was when Mrs Hait set the scuttle down on the edge of the brick coping of the cellar entrance and she and old Het turned the corner of the house in time to see the mule coincide with a rooster and eight white-leghorn hens comingout from under the house . Old Het said it looked just like something out of the Bible , or maybe out of some kind of hoodoo witches ' Bible : the mule that came out of the fog to begin with like a hant or a goblin , now kind of soaringback into the fog again borne on a cloud of little winged ones . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now carrying the worn-out stub of a broom though old Het did n't remember when she had picked it up . " There 's more in the front ! " old Het hollered . " That son of a bitch , " Mrs Hait said . There were more of them . Old Het said that little handkerchief-sized yard was full of mules and I. O. Snopes . It was so small that any creature with a stride of three feet could have crossed it in two paces , yet when they came in sight of it it must have looked like watching a drop of water through a microscope . Except that this time it was like being in the middle of the drop of water yourself . That is , old Het said that Mrs Hait and I. O. Snopes were in the middle of it because she said she stopped against the house where she would be more or less out of the way even though nowhere in that littlep239yard was going to be safe , and watched Mrs Hait still clutching the broom and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just her own invulnerability , though old Het said Mrs Hait was just too mad to notice , rush right into the middle of the drove , after the one with the flying halter-rein that was still vanishing into the fog still in that cloud of whirling loose feathers like confetti or the wake behind a speed boat . And Mr Snopes too , the mules running all over him too , he and Mrs Hait glaring at each other while he panted : " Where 's my money ? Where 's my half of it ? " " Catch that big son of a bitch with the halter , " Mrs Hait said . " Get that big son of a bitch out of here , " both of them , old Het and Mrs Hait both , running on so that Snopes 's panting voice was behind them now : " Pay me my money ! Pay me my part of it ! " " Watch out ! " old Het said she hollered . " He heading for the back again ! " " Get a rope ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , where is ere rope ? " Snopes hollered . " In the cellar , fore God ! " old Het hollered . She did n't wait either . " Go round the other way and head him ! " she said . And she said that when she and Mrs Hait turned that corner , there was the mule with the flying halter once more seeming to float lightly onward on a cloud of chickens with which , since the chickens had been able to go under the house and so along the chord while the mule had to go around on the arc , it had once more coincided . When they turned the next corner , they were in the back yard again . " Fore God ! " Het hollered . " He fixing to misuse the cow ! " She said it was like a tableau . The cow had come out of the shed into the middle of the back yard ; it and the mule were now facing each other about a yard apart , motionless , with lowered heads and braced legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half out of the now-open cellar door on the coping of which thep240scuttle of ashes still sat , where he had obviously gone seekingthe rope ; afterward old Het said she thought at the time an open cellar door was n't a very good place for a scuttle of live ashes , and maybe she did . I mean , if she had n't said she thought that , somebody else would , since there 's always somebody handy afterward to prove their foresight by your hindsight . Though if things were going as fast as she said they were , I do nt see how anybody there had time to think anything much . Because everything was already moving again ; when they went around the next corner this time , I.O. was leading , carrying the rope ( he had found it ) , then the cow , her tail raised and rigid and raked slightly like the flagpole on a boat , and then the mule , Mrs Hait and old Het coming last and old Het told again how she noticed the scuttle of live ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation of human refuse and Mrs Haft 's widowhood  --  emptyboxes for kindling , old papers , broken furniture  --  andthought again that was n't a very good place for the scuttle . Then the next corner . Snopes and the cow and the mule were all three just vanishing on the cloud of frantic chickens which had once more crossed beneath the house just in time . Though when they reached the front yard there was nobody there but Snopes . He was lying flat on his face , the tail of his coat flung forward over his head by the impetus of his fall , and old Het swore there was the print of the cow 's split foot and the mule 's hoof too in the middle of his white shirt . " Where 'd they go ? " she shouted at him . He did n't answer . " They tightening on the curves ! " she hollered at Mrs Hait . " They already in the back again ! " They were . She said maybe the cow had aimed to run back into the shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of desperation of valor and despair on the mule itself . Though she said that she and Mrs Hait did n't quite getp241there in time to see it : only to hear a crash and clash and clatter as the mule swerved and blundered over the cellar entrance . Because when they got there the mule was gone . The scuttle was gone from the cellar coping too but old Het said she never noticed it then : only the cow in the middle of the yard where she had been standing before , her fore legs braced and her head lowered like somebody had passed and snatched away the other book-end . Because she and Mrs Hait did n't stop either , Mrs Hait running heavily now , old Het said , with her mouth open and her face the color of putty and one hand against her side . In fact she said they were both run out now , going so slow this time that the mule overtook them from behind and she said it jumped clean over them both : a brief demon thunder rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the chickens had finally realised to stay under the house or maybe they were worn out too and just could n't make it this time ) ; when they reached the next corner the mule had finally succeeded in vanishing into the fog ; they heard its hooves , brief , staccato and derisive on the hard street , dying away . Old Het said she stopped . She said , " Well . Gentlemen , hush , " she said . " Ai nt we had  --  " Then she smelled it . She said she stood right still , smelling , and it was like she was actually looking at that open cellar as it was when they passed it last time without any coal scuttle setting on the coping . " Fore God , " she hollered at Mrs Hait , " I smell smoke ! Child , run in the house and get your money ! " That was about nine oclock . By noon the house had burned to the ground . Ratliff said that when the fire engine and the crowd got there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag in one hand and a framed crayon portrait of Mr Hait in the other , was just coming out of the house carrying an umbrella and wearing the army overcoat which Mr Hait had used to wear , in one pocket of which was a quart fruit jar packed with what remained of thep242eighty-five hundred dollars ( which would be most of it , according to how the neighbors said Mrs Hait lived ) and in the other a heavy nickel-plated revolver , and crossed the street to a neighbor 's house , where with old Het beside her in a second rocker , she had been sitting ever since on the gallery , the two of them rocking steadily while they watched the volunteer fire-fighters flinging her dishes and furniture up and down the street . By that time Ratliff said there were plenty of them interested enough to go back to the Square and hunt up I.O. and keep him posted . " What you telling me for ? " I.O. said . " It was n't me that set that-ere scuttle of live fire where the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was you that opened the cellar door though , " Ratliff said . " Sho , " Snopes said . " And why ? To get that rope , her own rope , right where she sent me to get it . " " To catch your mule , that was trespassing on her yard , " Ratliff said . " You cant get out of it this time . There ai nt a jury in the county that wont find for her . " " Yes , " Snopes said . " I reckon not . And just because she 's a woman . That 's why . Because she is a durned woman . All right . Let her go to her durned jury with it . I can talk too ; I reckon it 's a few things I could tell a jury myself about  --  " Then Ratliff said he stopped . Ratliff said he did n't sound like I.O. Snopes anyway because whenever I.O. talked what he said was so full of mixed-up proverbs that you stayed so busy trying to unravel just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could n't even tell just exactly what lie he had told you until it was already too late . But right now Ratliff said he was too busy to have time for even proverbs , let alone lies . Ratliff said they were all watching him . " What ? " somebody said . " Tell the jury about what ? " " Nothing , " he said . " Because why , because there aintgoing to be no jury . Me and Miz Mannie Hait ? You boysp243dont know her if you think she 's going to make trouble over a pure acci-dent could n't me nor nobody else help . Why , ai nt a fairer , finer woman in Yoknapatawpha County than Mannie Hait . I just wish I had a opportunity to tell her so . " Ratliff said he had it right away . He said Mrs Hait was right behind them , with old Het right behind her , carrying the shopping bag . He said she just looked once at all of them generally . After that she looked at I.O. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What mule ? " I.O. said . He answered that quick , almost automatic , Ratliff said . Because he did n't mean it either . Then Ratliff said they looked at one another for about a half a minute . " You 'd like to own that mule ? " he said . " It 'll cost you a hundred and fifty , Miz Mannie . " " You mean dollars ? " Mrs Hait said . " I do nt mean dimes nor nickels neither , Miz Mannie , " Snopes said . " Dollars , " Mrs Hait said . " Mules was n't that high in Hait 's time . " " Lots of things is different since Hait 's time , " Snopes said . " Including you and me , Miz Mannie . " " I reckon so , " she said . Then she went away . Ratliff said she turned without a word and left , old Het following . " If I 'd a been you , " Ratliff said , " I do nt believe I 'd a said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mean harried little face actually blazed , even frothing a little . " I just wisht she would , " Snopes said . " Her or anybody else , I do nt care who , to bring a court suit about anything , jest so it had the name mule and the name Hait in it  --  " and stopped , the face smooth again . " How 's that ? " he said . " What was you saying ? " " That you do nt seem to be afraid she might sue you for burning down her house , " Ratliff said . " Sue me ? " Snopes said . " Miz Hait ? If she was fixing to try to law something out of me about that fire , do youp244reckon she would a hunted me up and offered to pay me for it ? " That was about one oclock . Then it was four oclock ; Aleck Sander and I had gone out to Sartoris Station to shoot quail over the dogs that Miss Jenny Du Pre still kept , I reckon until Benbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Gavin was alone in the office to hear the tennis shoes on the outside stairs . Then old Het came in ; the shopping bag was bulging now and she was eating bananas from a paper sack which she clamped under one arm , the half-eaten banana in that hand while with the other she dug out a crumpled ten-dollar bill and gave it to Uncle Gavin . " It 's for you , " old Het said . " From Miss Mannie . I done already give him hisn "  --  telling it : waiting on the corner of the Square until it looked like sure to God night would come first , before Snopes finally came along , and she handed the banana she was working on then to a woman beside her and got out the first crumpled ten-dollar bill . Snopes took it . " What ? " he said . " Miz Hait told you to give it to me ? " " For that mule , " old Het said . " You do nt need to give me no receipt . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ten dollars ? " Snopes said . " For that mule ? I told her a hundred and fifty dollars . " " You 'll have to contrack that with her yourself , " old Het said . " She just give me this to hand to you when she left to get the mule . " " To get the  --  she went out there herself and taken that mule out of my lot ? " Snopes said . " Lord , child , " old Het said she said . " Miss Mannie ai nt skeered of no mule . Ai nt you done found that out ?  --  And now here 's yourn , " she said to Uncle Gavin . " For what ? " Uncle Gavin said . " I do nt have a mule to sell . " " For a lawyer , " old Het said . " She fixing to need ap245lawyer . She say for you to be out there at her house about sundown , when she had time to get settled down again . " " Her house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , honey , " old Het said . " Would you keer for a banana ? I done et about all I can hold . " " No , much obliged , " Uncle Gavin said . " You 're welcome , " she said . " Go on . Take some . If I et one more , I 'd be wishing the good Lord had n't never thought banana one in all His life . " " No , much obliged , " Uncle Gavin said . " You 're welcome , " she said . " I do nt reckon you 'd have nothing like a extra dime for a little snuff . " " No , " Uncle Gavin said , producing it . " All I have is a quarter . " " That 's quality , " she said . " You talk about change to quality , what you gets back is a quarter or a half a dollar or sometimes even a whole dollar . It 's just trash that cant think no higher than a nickel or ten cents . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's some folks thinks all I does , I tromps this town all day long from can-see to cant , with a hand full of gim me and a mouth full of much oblige . They 're wrong . I serves Jefferson too . If it 's more blessed to give than to receive like the Book say , this town is blessed to a fare-you-well because it 's steady full of folks willing to give anything from a nickel up to a old hat . But I 'm the onliest one I knows that steady receives . So how is Jefferson going to be steady blessed without me steady willing from dust-dawn to dust-dark , rain or snow or sun , to say much oblige ? I can tell Miss Mannie you be there ? " " Yes , " Uncle Gavin said . Then she was gone . Uncle Gavin sat there looking at the crumpled bill on the desk in front of him . Then he heard the other feet on the stairs and he sat watching the door until Mr Flem Snopes came in and shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Can you take a case for me ? "
