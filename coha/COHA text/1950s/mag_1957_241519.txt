TN February 1927 , Reporter James Thurber quit his $40-a-week job on the New York Evening Post to start work as a $100-a-week deskman on Harold Wallace Ross 's The New Yorker . Thurber was then 32 ; The New Yorker had just turned two ; and Editor Ross , at 34 , was already the whip-wielding crank who was to inspire and bedevil staffers until his death in 1951 . In the November Atlantic Humorist Thurber started a serialized memoir of Ross by recalling their early days together . <P> The two were destined to fit together like 4th and July , but they got off to a strange start when Ross hired Thurber as his managing editor . ( " In those days , " explained Thurber last week , " you started at the top and worked your way down . " ) Ross affected to despise writers ; Thurber wanted only to write . " He wanted , first of all , to know how old I was , and when I told him it set him off on a lecture . ' Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . ' They 're children . I was editor of the Stars and Stripes when I was twenty-five . Most men in their twenties do n't know their way around yet . I think it 's the goddam system of women schoolteachers . ' I told him that I wanted to write , and he snarled , ' Writers are a dime a dozen , Thurber . What I want is an editor . I ca n't find editors . Nobody grows up . Do you know English ? ' I said I thought I knew English . ' Everybody thinks he knows English , ' he said , ' but nobody does . I think it 's because of the goddam women shoolteachers . ' " <P> " From the beginning , " says Thurber , " Ross cherished his dream of a Central Desk at which an infallible omniscience would sit , a dedicated genius , out of Technology by Mysticism , effortlessly controlling and coordinating editorial personnel , contributors , office boys , cranks and other visitors , manuscripts , proofs , cartoons , captions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth each Thursday a magazine at once funny , journalistically sound , and flawless . He had persuaded himself that I might be just the wonder man he was looking for . " <P> Ross began life as a newspaperman . His first job , at 14 , was that of a reporter for the Salt Lake City Tribune , and one of his early assignments was to interview the madam of a house of prostitution . " Always self-conscious and usually uncomfortable in the presence of all but his closest women friends , " writes Thurber , " the young reporter began by saying to the bad woman ( he divided the other sex into good and bad ) , ' How many fallen women do you have ? ' " <P> Ross distrusted most of those who wrote for The New Yorker , says Thurber . " He nursed an editorial phobia about what he called the functional : ' bathroom and bedroom stuff . ' Years later he deleted from a Janet Planner ' London Letter ' a forthright explanation of the nonliquid diet imposed upon the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So-and-so ca n't write a story without a man in it carrying a woman to bed , ' he wailed . And again , ' I 'll never print another John O'Hara story I do n't understand . I want to know what his people are doing . ' "
