Albert Schweitzer ( Hill-Anderson ) , filmed mostly in Africa by Erica Anderson under appalling technical difficulties , is a beautifully photographed , badly colored , thoroughly interesting biography of a gifted , practical humanitarian . <P> The great experience of Schweitzer 's youth , as he says in the commentary he wrote for the film , was that of suffering . As the son of a Protestant preacher in Alsace , he was rejected by the other boys in his village as a highborn brat , and the rejection made him , he says , almost morbidly sensitive to the sufferings of others . Although in his 20s he became famous as organist , philosopher , theologian , he never stopped wondering what he could do to ease the world 's pain . At 30 , he abandoned fame , plunged into medicine , determined to spend his life as a missionary doctor in French Equatorial Africa . " Man belongs to man , " he wrote . " Man has claims on man . . . One who escapes misfortune should render thanks by doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is a fairly candid camera record of how Schweitzer today , half a century after he made the central decision of his life , is still paying humanity 's claim . His hospital at Lambarn , two days up the Ogowe River , is a rough compound of iron-roofed wooden shacks in a jungle clearing . Schweitzer and his small staff-three doctors , nine nurses - work with comparatively crude instruments ( complicated medical gadgets invariably break down in the jungle climate ) . They have modern drugs , but they do not despise the native alexins . Says Schweitzer : " I have not wanted to introduce these simple people to techniques and tools upon which they might learn to depend , and which would be unavailable to them in their own communities . " <P> The film conveys a strong impression that Schweitzer is a forceful personality in whom will and energy are more apparent than saintliness . He is gruff but grandfatherly with his native patients , appears relieved when he can spend a couple of hours at his manuscripts or , best of all , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano . Schweitzer has said that he did not go to Africa to civilize but to atone . <P> Three Brave Men ( 20th Century-Fox ) is based on the famous Chasanow case ( TIME , May 10 , 1954 et seq. ) , which in one fell scandal discredited the Navy 's existing security program . But are bumbling bureaucrats the villains of the piece ? Not at all . " This , " the studio declares with unblinking self-gratulation , " is the story the Navy wanted told ... of the lengths to which governmental agencies will go to safeguard the sacred rights of individuals ... of an Assistant Secretary of the Navy who has the moral courage to discover and publicly admit his mistake .
