Last week the art world got news of a major find : a previously uncatalogued Rembrandt that seemed to bear all the authentic marks of the master 's work . A few collectors and experts even got a chance to look at it briefly when it was put up for auction at a London gallery . Entitled The Flight into Egypt , the small ( 20 in. by 16 in. ) painting showed Joseph leading a donkey bearing the Virgin and Child out of a dark wood , their faces lit by the glow of a lantern hanging from the pommel of the saddle . In one of his more familiar etchings , Rembrandt had used the same idea . <P> The painting turned up when Britain 's 87-year-old Charles John Robert **31;10094;TOOLONG , 21st Baron Clinton , * decided to turn his big Devonshire manor into tin agricultural college and dispose of the family paintings . Flight into Egypt had been bought by an 18th Century Clinton ancestor , had hung in the manor 's billiard room almost ever since . Nineteenth Century cataloguers had somehow missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag about it . <P> Art lovers elsewhere would presumably have to wait a while to see the new Rembrandt . London 's Leggatt Bros . Gallery , which paid an auction price of $28,000 for the picture , had not yet announced what they were going to do with it , meanwhile refused to let it be photographed . <P> <P> *Distant kin to General Sir Henry Clinton , who was commander in chief of the British forces in North America during the last three years of the American Revolution .
