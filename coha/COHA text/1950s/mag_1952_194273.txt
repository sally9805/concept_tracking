THE SKIN ( 344 pp. ) - Curzio Mala-parte-Houghton Mifflin ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> " Our true country , " declares Curzio Malaparte in his new book , " is our own skin . " By this definition , Signor Malaparte is a redoubtable patriot . <P> Before 1943 , he was the Duce 's tame intellectual , a pet journalist of Fascism , who , as special correspondent for Milan 's Corriere delta Sera , was fed rich scoops of news on the silver spoon of favoritism . When the war began to turn against the Axis , so did Malaparte 's pen . He was punished with brief confinement in a Rome prison , then allowed to retire to a Capri villa ; there he was liberated by the Allied forces . Malaparte promptly put all his inside information about high Fascist circles at the disposal of the Allied command , and was rewarded with a commission as liaison officer with the U.S. Fifth Army . <P> The next year Malaparte fortified his status as an anti-Fascist with the publication of Kaputt ( TIME , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes about Nazi-Fascist cruelty . Kaputt was a sensational bestseller on the Continent , and made Malaparte one of Europe 's leading apostles of nausea-a sort of Jean Paul Spillane . <P> Now , in his second autobiographical account , The Skin , Malaparte has done for his new masters what he did for his old in Kaputt . The treatment is just as popular , too . The Skin has already sold 100,000 copies in Italy , 200,000 in France , 250,000 in Germany , and is a bestseller in Argentina , Belgium , Denmark , The Netherlands , Norway and Spain . <P> Author Malaparte begins his pitch with a sugary invocation of his victims . " The American army , " he coos , " is the loveliest , the kindest . . . army in the world . . . I like Americans . . . and I proved it a hundred times during the war . . . Their souls are pure , much purer than ours . I like the Americans . . . because they believe that Christ is always on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a sin to be in the wrong . " <P> Thereupon Malaparte proceeds , with crude but cruel satiric effect , to lead a number of U.S. officers ( and indirectly his readers too ) on a macabre tour through the gutters of wartime Naples . He shows mothers who sell their children into prostitution ; but then , says Malaparte with a smirk , there are also the children who would gladly sell their mothers . He dwells for part of a chapter on a street peopled with twisted female dwarfs , who fed , he asserts gleefully , on the unnatural lusts of the American ranks . Another chapter is concerned with a visit to a shop that sells blonde merkins ( pubic wigs ) . U.S. Negro soldiers , Malaparte explains , like blondes . <P> A little farther on , Malaparte alleges that there existed during the World War II a " homosexual maquis " - and what 's more , he claims , they had a lot to do with winning the war for the Allies . This is somehow connected with the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superior to the sexual feeling of men and women . " <P> On &; on he goes , reporting all the horrors he can remember and imagine-a " flag made of human skin " fluttering in the breeze , the rows of crucified Jews he saw on a Ukrainian steppe , the time an Allied general served his guests a boiled child ( or was it relly only a fish that looked almost human ? ) .
