CHIANG KAI-SHEK ( 382 pp. ) - Emily Hahn-Doubleday ( $5 ) . <P> In the early 19305 every U.S. schoolboy - and his teacher , too-knew the essential facts about China 's Chiang Kaishek : Chiang , married to a pretty Chinese girl with a U.S. education , was a selfless Christian general who had fought down Communists and war lords to unite his country for the first time in its modern history . Ten years later many a schoolboy , teacher and clubwoman was hearing a far different story : Chiang 's wife was an arrogant creature who slept on silk sheets , while Chiang himself was corrupt and stupid ; he stubbornly blocked the path to China 's progress , and went out of his way to pick fights with those persecuted heroes of agrarian reform , the Chinese Communists . It was to the mutual disaster of both Chiang and the U.S. that in the critical years following World War II the Communist-line distortions of the second picture were smearily reflected in the smart talk of sophisticates , in the books and the book reviews on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. <P> Author Emily Hahn , whose youthful passion for Manila cigars , free love and self-advertisement caused arching eyebrows from Shanghai to Chungking in the 19305 , has now maturely channeled her fierce independence to good cause . With the informal , sometimes gabby style of her China Coast pieces in The New Yorker , and of her bestsellers ( China to Me , The Soong Sisters ) , she has written the first popular biography to examine Chiang in the only way he can be understood : as a singularly great man , a lonely combination of Confucian self-discipline and Methodist virtue , forced to fight at once against centuries of obsolete custom , Japan 's armed invasion , and a vicious , un-Chinese revolution inspired by Moscow . <P> Stalin Outguessed . Without belaboring the point , Author Hahn lets the facts prove that Chiang was awesomely right in recognizing the Communists as the greatest threat of all . After a trip to Moscow in 1923 he wrote : " . . . Some of our Chinese Communists who are in Russia always scold other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never realizing that they themselves have already completely become slaves of Russia . " <P> In 1926 , preparing to lead his Nationalist army north to Peking , Chiang threw out the Communists who had edged themselves into powerful positions in the Kuomintang-including the head of the Nationalist propaganda department , one Mao Tse-tung . In 1927 he turned irrevocably and ruthlessly on the Communists , both in the army and in the Red industrial stronghold of Shanghai . Says Author Hahn : " On this ' white massacre ' that began April 12 Communists are eloquent . Chiang did not wait to be betrayed ; he committed the unforgivable sin ; he outguessed Stalin and struck first . " <P> Communists Outfought . The Communists withdrew southward to Kiangsi and Hunan Provinces , boldly resumed their offensive while the Japanese were striking in Manchuria in 1931 . Chiang alienated many a patriotic student and intellectual when he turned the Japanese invasion over to the League of Nations and prepared to turn his armies on the Communists instead of the Japanese . " If China ventures to fight the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rear and chaos will quickly overtake the whole country . "
