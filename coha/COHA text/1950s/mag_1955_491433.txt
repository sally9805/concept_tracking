THE first time I walked in my New England woods with a dainty 20-gauge automatic shotgun on my shoulder , I was appalled . It 's true that the woods were beautiful . The dogwood , which in spring lights this green and leafy world with brilliant white or pink blossoms , was now magnificent in its crimson dress . Yet , however glorious the flame of the woods might be , the wildlife I had expected was n't there . Where were the wild turkeys which had graced the hoard at Thanksgiving time back in the 1600 's when the Pilgrims carried their blunderbusses with them to the meetinghouse ? For that matter , where were the ruffed grouse , the pheasant , the quail which were so recently there in abundance ? I was hunting with excellent dogs  --  old Joe , a magnificent pointer , and Sister , a lovely , intuitive setter , either of which could pick a lock to find a game bird . Moreover , I was accompanied by 8 woods-wise companion , George Heinold , who 'd grown up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are the wild fowl of yore ? " was mani ? fest : gone . Now , this absence of wild fowl did not make much sense to me . To those unacquainted with New England 's out-of-doors , it might seem that this whole heavily populated area is crawling with peck ple . That is not the case . All these states , witt ? their rough and wrinkled terrain , are stilt except in urban areas , thickly wooded , albeit most , often with second-growth timber . Certainly the frigidity of the climate is no excuse , because the hunting is excellent in the cold-toed , frosty-eared state of Maine . In the intervening decade since I bought my farm a few miles from the center of Guilford , Connecticut , I have watched those woods diligently . One time only I saw a small covey of quail thunder into the air . Yet my friends tell me that when they were youngsters there were coveys of fifty about . Again , I once saw , on a blue-gray , almost-whiskered stone wall , a grouse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another time , one of my venerable bird dogs , crippled but faithful , brought in a pheasant . Perhaps that pheasant was old and ailing , since the dog had had her pelvis crushed twice by automobiles , and was anything but athletic . Yet she was a bird dog . I suppose when she ran across that pheasant she just did what came naturally . As time passed , I more and more felt the lack of life in my woods , except for an occasional coon , skunk , fox , field mouse , the inevitable crows , and a deer or two every year or so . Squirrels we have , at least just now , in such abundance that it is a problem to keep them from coming down the chimney as malevolent intruders that have no kinship to Santa Claus . Muskrats flip around in the swamps in the heart of these woods . Of course , there are migratory fowl such as wood ducks and small , annual flights of tweezer-billed woodcocks , but the old stay-putters such as quail were no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . You see , we are blessed with many high old hickory-nut trees to supply food to game . " Trees so high , " according to our friend and cook , Mary Arnwine , " that you have to look up twice to see the top . " Furthermore , I 've had pretty good luck raising chestnut trees in a part of t he country where such a thing is considered impossible . Tiny though these trees be , I 've seen the husks where the busy squirrels have stripped them of nuts . These trees are specially bred to be blight resistant : five varieties blended into one , including the old native American variety that was devastated by the blight soon after the turn of the century . Those chestnut trees were planted for and will nourish wild things . There are countless other nutrients , such as the annual crop of acorns from the oak trees . In summer , of course , there are cornfields to be raided , and lavish varieties of succulent berries : blackberries , huckleberriee , raspberries , blueberries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rye grass . And when the going gets rough and the snow is deep and iced over , there are , however bitter they may lie , cedar berries and cedar blades in abundance for the starving . Again , in winter , the cedar brakes furnish not merely food but essential cover to which the deer go . There are some cedar trees and pines in my woods  --  enough in any event so that , an alert deer can escape an inept hunter . Those deer , however , are n't going to have to run any more on my place . For I have taken a notion that fascinates me . I 'd like to see the wild life in those woods looking pretty much the way the Pilgrims saw it . I do n't plan to load any blunderbusses or wear any tall hnts or buckled shoes to church , but I 'm doing something that might catch your imagination . I 'm enlivening t hose woods and fields with wild fowl . At them I will never swing a gun . Mind you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these man-raised birds are going to have a tough time . Yet , fortunately for the birds , these woods were cut over shortly before I purchased my Connecticut farm . The thickets then were composed of hardly more than switches . Nowadays there are some stanch trees . but still fine stretches of dense thicket remain . The first essential step in carrying out this plan , it seemed to me , since my little farm is but twenty-five acres , was to sound out my neighbors and see if they 'd like to put their land in my scheme for establishing a game refuge . I spoke first to Ernest Parmelee , whose land virtually surrounds mine , all either in woods , open corn land or hay fields . He was delighted , and at once fell to telling me about how many hundred pounds of feed his sister , Ella , always fed to the birds each winter anyway . Other neighbors ? the Sidney Lealies , Miss Caughey and Mins Little , the Lewis LeMontagne family , the Woolsey Conover 's ? were all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went over to the Roller Game Farm in nearby Clinton , Connecticut , to inquire what species might he expected to survive in this part of the country . What I wanted was Great Northern quail , ring-necked pheasants , and by all means some wild turkeys , not one of which I had ever seen in the flesh . This farm , which raises wild things not for sale but for pleasure , hue everything from smolt birds I o huffidoee . Here was told that , if properly fed , all the birds in which I was interested would thrive . Having received this encouraging news , I then got in touch with the game warden who covers this region  --  Lawrence W. Theies ? to find out the names of some game-bird breeders who could supply what was needed . He was extremely enthusiastic about my project and gave me a whole string of names and addresses . In the end I dealt with Frank Abramczyk. whose Twin Oaks Game Farm was located in Berlin , Connecticut , a suburb of New Britain . I ordered twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of wild turkeys . A date was made for t he birds to be delivered at ten in the morning two days later . The interval was a hectic one , spent in a flurry of buying bird feed , having 100 signs printed that would inform the public of the location of this game refuge , and finally getting word to the neighbors when the birds would be released , since it was an event they all wished to attend . At the appointed time , then , 1 got a phone call from Mr. Abramczyk , who was downtown in Guilford , waiting for me to come lead him out to my place . Now , of all the enthusiasm this little venture had generated up till now , no one , not even the neighborhood children , was more happy and excited than Frank Abramczyk . " You do n't know what this means to me , " he said . " I think your birds are going to do tine , but if there 's any way I can help you , just phone me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank that he raised 1000 turkeys a year , 8000 to 10,000 pheasant , 5000 to 6000 quail . Since Frank was a third-generation bird man , I was naturally pleased that he was impressed by the outstanding features of the terrain . You see , we have three brooks that run so swiftly that they never freeze in winter , and three old gravel pits with sides so steep that they are never likely to be entirely covered by snow . These last , of course , are important in that these birds require grit for craw material throughout the winter , just as much as they require food . By now the neighbors had begun to gather , all hands rife with excitement and full of questions for Frank . They learned that the turkeys will roost in evergreens at dusk , and that the hens in a state of nature average laying about ten or fifteen red-dotted , cream-colored eggs a year ; that under the same conditions pheasant lay nine to a dozen eggs a year , and quail about as many as it takes to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quail 's nest is destroyed after the eggs are laid , she 'll start again . All these birds lay their eggs on the ground . usually in a nest made of leaves and moss . In captivity , wild turkeys have their claws trimmed to prevent injuries during mating season . The hen pheasant has the upper half of her beak ringed to keep her from eating the shells off her own eggs during the laying season , when there is insufficient calcium in her diet . But here , ranging over the rocky woods would keep the turkeys ' claws from becoming too lethal . The hen pheasant would surely have such wide areas to cover that the bones of deceased tiny animals would supply her with adequate calcium . SATURDAY We learned that during the hatching period the turkeys , like quail , take turns  --  now the female , now the male  --  at sitting on the nest . With pheasant , however , the hen has to handle the job unassisted . Frank added that both turkeys and pheasant are extremely diligent and skilled when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these birds , he went . on , like to take cover under junipers , which protect them from 1 he snow as completely as do those impromptu wigwams the corn shocks . Otherwise , adequate brush piles would be essential to their survival during the winter , when the woods , except for the evergreens , are leafless and , like a schooner in an eighty-knot wind , operate under bare poles . Indeed , it was just such winds that , without the slightest assistance from myself or anyone else , had created brush piles at convenient intervals by blowing the tops out of our trees and massing them on the ground . As it was now almost time to release the birds , 1 could n't help thinking how fortunate we were in the make-up of the neighborhood dog population . The last of my bird dogs is , alas , dead . The other dogs in the neighborhood  --  beautiful boxers , collies , cocker spaniels , cairns and wire-haired terriers , a single hound  --  might be helpful in chasing off predators , but none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting game birds . The whole idea looked better all the time . I knew some of these birds would fly away from this refuge where they were to he fed and protected . I did n't think all of them would . In any case across the road only slightly south by west was 1500 acres of posted land . Frank Abramczyk began to reach into his crates and hand around quail , so that eight or ten could he released at a single location . These quail were beautiful . Most were barely past adolescence and in excellent condition . Their eyes were bright and their coats had a lovely sheen . But they were frightened and their hearts heat like hammers . Then , at a signal , they were released , and the air was full not only of visual beauty but of a crescendo of drumming as , in squadron formation . I hey flew off into the woods  --  as frightened , perhaps , of where they were going as of the strange hands they were leaving , since this was their first journey into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of security upon the shoulder of young Dick LeMontagne as if he were St. Francis of Assisi . After an awed silence of at least a minute , Dick gently put the bird to flight , and it soared off to join its mates . Then many of the adults spoke of the decades that had passed since they 'd seen such a sight in this area . Next , mid a patch of corn stalks , the pheasants thundered into the air , makEVENING POST ing straight for a closely meshed , brook-veined thicket . We 'd thought we knew in advance where they 'd go , since such pheasant as the state had released in these parts in the past had usually congregated there for the few days between then and the time they were shot . We had another range selected for the turkeys , an alfalfa patch surrounded by woods on four sides , except for a wagon-road entrance , and having a brook bubbling hard by . When I asked Frank about these birds ' relative weights , he said the Northern quail average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison to the Southern bobwhite . The cock pheasant , he said , weighed something like three and a half pounds , the hens two and a half . The turkeys average eight pounds for the hens and twenty for the gobblers . As the time approached to release the turkeys , which still lay imprisoned in soft , coarsely spun bags of jute in Frank 's black panel truck , the tension began to mount . The quail , heart stealers though they be , with their lovely calls , their gentle colors and endearing ways , the dynamic drumming of their wings , had , as curtain raisers , drawn a standing ovation . The pheasant , always dramatic in the beauty of the male 's plumage and his alert , haughty carriage , beside which the hen seems demure and feminine , had held up their end in supplying that rare essential , a good second act . Rut most of our company of interested friends , few of whose fathers or grandfathers could remember having seen a wild turkey in its savage state , were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost . A bush fell upon us all as Frank Abramczyk reached toward the first hag containing a wild turkey . Having somewhat anticipated that the turkeys would , in the nature of things , probably steal the show , I 'd spent an earlier evening consulting not the latest but one of the earliest and most affectionately remembered authorities on thin creature . That of course would have to he none other than the great artist and naturalist , John James Audubon . In part , be had this to say : " The twilit turkey is irregularly migratory , as well as irregularly gregarious . " This man , who lived in a time when there was an abundance of wild turkeys in this country , goes on to say that they naturally gravitate , flock after flock . " until one district is entirely deserted , while another is , as it were , overflowed by them . " He points out that these general movements are roughly inclined to follow t he weather . " The ... gobblers associate in parties of from ten to a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the latter are seen either advancing singly , each with its brood of young . . . or in connexion with other families ... often amounting to seventy or eighty individuals , all intent on shunning the old cocks , which , even when the young lairds have obtained this two thirds grown ' size , will fight with , and often destroy them by repeated blows on the head . Old and young , however , all move in the same course , and on foot , unless their progress be interrupted by a river , or the hunter 's dog force them to take wing . " When they come upon a river , they betake themselves to the highest eminences , and there often remain a whole day , or sometimes two , as if for the purpose of consultation . During this time the melee are heard gobbling , calling , and making much ado , and are 19 , 1955 seen strutting about , as if to raise their courage to a pitch befitting the emergency . Even the females and young assume something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run around each other , purring loudly , and performing extravagant leaps . At length , when the weather appears settled , and all round is quiet , the whole party mount to the tops of the highest trees , whence , at a signal , consisting of a single cluck , given by a leader , the flock takes flight- for the opposite shore . The old and fat birds easily get over , even should the river he a mile in breadth ; but the younger and lees robust frequently fall into the water  --  not to he drowned , however , as might be imagined . They bring their wings close to their body , spread out their tail as a support , stretch forward their neck , and striking out their legs with great vigour , proceed rapidly toward the shore ; on approaching which , should they find it too steep for landing , they cease their exertions for a few moments , float down the stream until they come to an accessible part , and by a violent effort generally extricate themselves from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large stream , they ram-hie about for some time , as if bewildered . In this state , they fail an easy prey to t he hunter . " Frank opened a bag and handed me a wild turkey , beautifully trim and obviously so much more built for flying than his tame relatives . He was the color of blue-purple smoke except for his crimson comb and wattles and the chestnut band around his tail . Unlike the chunky domestic turkey , he was shaped more like a torpedo . I held him cradled in my left arm , his beclawed feet in my right hand . You see , we wanted to release them in pairs aimed in the same general direction so they 'd not have too much trouble making contact with each other . For after all , like turkeys that have swum a river , these were tired and bewildered from being caught , sacked and hauled . This one 's heart was pumping madly . But , however caught up I was in his inner excitement , my eyes could not leave the goatee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his breast . Even before his mate could be brought forth , he decided to make his getaway , the first step of which was to start walloping the daylights out of my face with his right wing . Yet having , as I did , my hands full , I simply held him and got walloped until he quieted down . Now his mate was ready for release . According to Frank Abramczyk  --  and this information staggers my imagination and credulity  --  we were about to liberate the first wild turkeys ever released on a private game refuge in Connecticut . He had checked , he said , with his colleagues and found this to be true . Surely the least he could have meant was that these were the first Connecticut-raised wild turkeys freed under such circumstances . To me it was unimportant at the moment . I was consumed with interest for these turkeys alone . At a nod from Frank , we opened our hands , gave each bird a little boost , and off they soared to us at through ltehaesta drama . with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked corn and small grain ? was distributed where it seemed natural that the birds would regroup . It has continued to be put in the same places on every succeeding day . Furthermore , this will be done on skis even after snow makes the roads impassable to vehicular traffic . It was mid-October when the birds were released . The woods then were volcanically alive with color and the recent memory of summer . Now the sere New England winter is upon us . The trees are bare . The woods are floored with a thick , sometimes wind-moved. russet carpet of leaves . Enough time has passed for us to know how these pen-raised birds of aboriginal wildness have reacted to unchaperoned life in the woods  --  unchaperoned inasmuch as no one is at hand , hour by hour , particularly in the night , to protect , them from predators . Perhaps you 'd like to know how our experiment has tuned out . In the first place , it 's given the neighborhood veal pleasure , drawn us , country people all , closer together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three centuries ago . No longer do we , on meeting , say , " How do you do ? " Instead , with genuine interest , we say , " What have you seen lately ? " And each time that . question is naked , there is a positive and exciting answer , since everyone has been watching and checking with his neighbors . One of the interesting things is that , within a few hours after the turkeys had attained freedom , one was ostracized by the other three . This pariah " took up " at the Conover farm , and it became a pleasant sight on a Sunday afternoon to watch Woolsey Conover feeding cracked corn to one wild turkey and seven or eight quail . However , this turkey eventually moved across the February 19 , 1955 road into an area near the L. G. Flicks , where still another pair of quail had established themselves . And while I 'd never had the pleasure of meeting the Flicks , since their road veers off below mine , I was soon receiving reports that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hands had become good friends . The other three turkeys migrated to the land of Capt . Terence Greene , USN ! Het. ) , who , by the way , has been raising grouse , generation after generation , in the deep woods behind his old salt-box house . As you 'd expect , somebody shot one of the turkeys , But the perpetrator 's name was kept quiet because of the general angry mutteringa . I , however , learned how much the turkey dressed-out . And the weight , slightly over six pounds , was so small that I 'm sure it was a hen . I 'll always remember how beautiful she was . The pheasant ? and , incidentally , most quail men abhor pheasant as " ground hawks " that destroy quail eggs and young quail as well ? have scattered pretty generally through our woods and fields . And each time I see them , I 'm struck by the quality of alertness with which they bear themselves . What 's more , now that the shooting has been stilled on this land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples at night and graze in the open meadows . Our pond is almost never without wild ducks . The LeMontagnes , at last report , had inherited , of all things , a single quail , though it goes without saying that , as spring approaches , he 'll remedy his loneliness with the famous vocal ability of his kind . There are a few quail which range in my woods . But nothing , I suppose , has given so much pleasure as the quail which have responded to the kindness of Ella Parmelee , who 's been feeding birds for years . As she watches , with anticipation , through the living-room window , two cocks and a hen come up three times a day  --  usually just after dawn , again at 1:30 and 4:00 in the afternoon  --  and have their meals ten feet away in the side yard . More than that , on icy nights these trusting creatures politely roost under the Parmelees ' back porch . This willingness to feed at a human domicile must not be taken as a degenerative sign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coveys of wild quail which came up in fall and winter to feed with as many farmers ' flocks of chickens . The rest of the birds , some of which I see every day , must surely have become wise enough , by now , in the ways of the woods to protect themselves from such marauders as hawks . For these quail , which first wandered about in bewilderment , now venture into the open only before sunrise , after sundown or on cloudy days . It 's my belief at this point that wild turkeys are too inclined to migrate to have a proper place in a game refuge of only a few hundred acres such as ours , but it is nice to know they 're in the neighborhood . The pheasant and the quail seem content to remain in our smhoreeltertehedyre fieldtsharinvdintghi thriving . thickets . Further- Should you own a few acres of land , have a group of co-operative neighbors and love wild fowl , I commend such a project to you . Surely the song of the quail and the abrupt flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whir of a wing is never beard . To us  --  and I think I speak for all my neighbors  --  ours has been a deep and continuing satisfaction .
