Pale and earnest Hugh Cross seemed destined to warm benches while first-stringers flashed upfield . Eventually he became Republican lieutenant-governor of Illinois , served without public notice for eight years ( 1940-48 ) until the Democrats , headed by new Governor Adlai Stevenson , moved into the capitol . In 1949 Harry Truman put Hugh Cross on the bipartisan Interstate Commerce Commission ; four months ago , the rotating chairmanship finally reached him . Last week , out in midfield at 59 , Hugh Cross was caught in the latest congressional investigation of a conflict-of-interest case . <P> At issue was the loss by Chicago 's ancient Parmelee Transportation Co. of its 102-year-old franchise to haul passengers and baggage between the city 's eight painfully scattered railroad stations . Last spring the railroads , considering Parmelee inefficient and overpriced , threw open bidding on a new five-year contract . Successful low bidder was Railroad Transfer Service , Inc. , headed by tempestuous John Keeshin , trucking magnate and longtime , if unlikely , friend of quiet Hugh Cross . <P> The ICC , which polices U.S. railroads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate investigations subcommittee , meeting in executive session , heard allegations that Chairman Cross went out of his way to present himself to the railroads as a character witness on behalf of Bidder Keeshin . Also discussed was an alleged job offer by Keeshin to Cross , who admitted that he helped Keeshin but flatly denied that his motive was anything more than friendship . <P> As Chairman Cross emerged shakily from the closed hearings , the Senate subcommittee voted unanimously to hold open sessions ; the Justice Department requested a transcript of testimony for possible later action . <P> Led by Arkansas Democrat John Mc-Clellan , the investigators said they hoped frankly that gentle Hugh Cross , hitherto a highly reputable public servant , would resign . Hugh Cross decided last week not to stay and fight . In a letter of resignation to President Eisenhower , he called the still-fuzzy charges against him " baseless . " Wrote he : " I am realistic enough to know that , unfounded as they are , the mere pendency of such charges impairs my further service on the commission and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appreciated " the years of diligent service you have rendered . " the President accepted star-crossed Hugh Cross 's resignation without further comment . The Senate investigators canceled open hearings .
