Silent Night may be good enough for some people , but not for the sales-bent pop music trade . By last week the industry could proudly report that , since early fall , it has produced 87 new pop singles for the Christmas market-with Santa Glaus mentioned in the titles of only 26 of them. * <P> The cascade ranged in mood from Silent Night itself and a musical rendering of the Lord 's Prayer to a husky-voiced double-entendre by Eartha Kitt entitled Santa Baby , and something called Cool Yule , sung and trumpeted by Louis ( " Satchmo " ) Armstrong . But inevitably , after the runaway success of last year 's I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus ( TIME , Dec. 15 ) , the best brains in the pop music business have been boiling overtime to find another small-fry special . <P> By last week it looked as though Columbia Records ' Mitch Miller , the maestro who produced I Saw Mommy , was ahead of the field again . Title of his new prize number : I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a juvenile songstress , an implacable rhythm and severely single-minded lyrics . Sample : <P> Do n't want a doll , no dinky tinkertoy , <P> I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy . <P> The songstress , plucked from an Oklahoma City TV show , is a ten-year-old named Gayla Peevey . Gayla has a precociously mature manner before a microphone and delivers her lines with the raucous confidence of an Ethel Merman . In recognition of the fact that Hippopotamus has already sold better than 300,000 copies , i.e. , about as well as Mommy at the same time last year , Mitch Miller and Columbia are hunting up more songs for her to sing . In a recognition of its own , Oklahoma City 's WKY-TV , which discovered Gayla , began an air campaign this week for public donations to buy her a hippopotamus for Christmas . <P> <P> * Among the year 's variations : Santa Claus Rides a Strawberry Roan , Missus Santa Claus , How Can Santa Come to Puerto Rico ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
