In the tobacco country around Lowe 's Crossroads , Ky. , where Alben Barkley lived as a boy , going to church on Sunday was the most important event of the week . It was from the country preachers of Kentucky that young Alben acquired first impressions of oratorical technique , and the style he learned from them stayed with him to his last word . From the Sunday-meeting atmosphere he also drew many of his famed stories . He often told the one about the two deacons , one a Republican and one a Democrat , who were conducting a service together . " Oh Lord , " prayed the Republican deacon , " let us Republicans hang together whether in accord or discord . " Countered the <P> Democratic deacon : " Oh Lord , be not particular-any cord will do . " <P> Over the years Barkley 's vigorous oratory and his rich , kindly humor won him ever-widening political success . In 1905 , only four years after he started practicing law , he was elected prosecuting attorney for McCracken County , in 1909 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives as a party-line Wilsonian , and then in 1926 to the Senate , where he became such a faithful cam paigner and stumper that Franklin Roosevelt threw him the majority leadership ( through the medium of a ' ' Dear Alben " letter ) in 1937 . <P> Cricket v. Stallion . When he was Ma jority Leader , Barkley 's opponents called him a mere puppet of the man in the White House . Then , one day in 1944 , Roosevelt vetoed the best tax-increase bill that faithful Alben could tug through a hostile Senate . Barkley resigned as Majority Leader , led the Senate in overriding the veto , was re-elected by acclamation. and won an apology from the President . In the process , Barkley dared to ridicule Franklin Roosevelt . Attacking the President 's criticism of the tax on timber , Barkley roared on the Senate floor : " The President cites his own experience as a timber man . I do know that he sells Christmas trees at Christmas time . But to compare these little pine bushes with a sturdy oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cricket to a stallion . " <P> That attack may well have locked Alben Barkley out of the White House . At the Democratic Convention in 1944 , Roosevelt passed up Barkley and picked Harry Truman as the second man on the ticket . Bitterly disappointed , Barkley nevertheless made a passionate nominating speech for F.D.R. In. 1948 it looked as if Harry Truman , too , might pass up Barkley , but Barkley 's keynote speech aroused a defeatist convention and made him the logical nominee for Vice President . <P> The Big Chance . He became the respected " Veep , " a title created by his grandchildren and adopted by all of the U.S. He was the only Vice President of the U.S. to be married while in office . His wife of 44 years had died in 1947 , after a long and expensive illness that Barkley paid for by tireless work as an orator at $300 to $1,000 a speech . While the public cheered him on , he courted and won , in 1949 , Mrs. Jane Hadley , a handsome widow from St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make the grade or not . " said the Vice President shortly before their engagement was announced , " but it 's wonderful to have so many people pulling for me. "
