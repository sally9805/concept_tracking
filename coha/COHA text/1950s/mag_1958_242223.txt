The defenders of Bridgeport 's Gothic-towered Walnut Wood mansion , designed in 1846 by famed Architect Alexander Jackson Davis ( TIME , Oct. 21 et seq. ) , resorted to politics , petitions , injunctions , fund-raising and even picketing in their efforts to save the Connecticut landmark . But by last weekend the battle was lost . Bridgeport 's Democratic Mayor Samuel J. Tedesco , who skinned through to victory by 161 votes last November on a Save-the-Manse platform , ordered wrecking crews to tear down Walnut Wood and make way for a new city hall and civic center . The Bridgeport Historical Society claimed to have $157,000 in pledges to preserve and maintain the building . Snapped Mayor Tedesco : " Not one red cent has been produced up to this moment . " Walnut Wood , just about the finest Gothic Revival mansion in the U.S. , was doomed .
