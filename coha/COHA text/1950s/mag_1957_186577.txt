The Tattered Dress ( Universal-International ) is a courtroom melodrama . The hero ( Jeff Chandler ) , cast as " the greatest trial lawyer since Clarence Darrow , " is a sort of jukebox genius who will sing almost any tune for almost anybody who provides the coin . When a young hellionaire ( Philip Reed ) murders his wife 's boy friend . Lawyer Chandler finagles an acquittal . For the next hour or so the pattern of the plot looks like something perpetrated by a drunken silkworm . Is the sheriff ( Jack Carson ) the crook ? Is the hero the villain ? Is the lawyer the defendant ? Does anybody care ? Actor Chandler seems to care deeply , because he tries so hard , but his performance never really hits the target . He can not seem to distinguish between beau and Darrow . <P> Men in War ( Security Pictures ; United Artists ) . " They ca n't do that ! " spluttered Colonel Blimp as the Japanese raced through the supposedly impassable jungles of Malaya in 1941 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Army , which recently made a similar protest to the makers of this movie , now seems to have been guilty of a similar Blimpertinence . The script was condemned , and all Army assistance denied to its producers , because several scenes contained " incidents against regulations ' ' - notably incidents in which a renegade sergeant disputes ( though he does not disobey ) the authority of a lieutenant . But if Men in War does not always conform to the prim letter of the Army manual , it holds to the raw spirit of combat as hard as any dogface clutches his rifle . <P> Korea , Sept. 6. 1950 . The North Koreans have broken through the Naktong line . An American platoon is isolated , surrounded . Says the lieutenant ( Robert Ryan ) : " We walk out . " Then comes a stroke of luck . A jeep comes roaring across an open field . Passengers : a bitter , combat-weary sergeant ( Aldo Ray ) , and his shell-shocked colonel ( Robert Keith ) , debris of a distant battle . The lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , forces the sergeant to march with the platoon to Hill 465 . But is the divisional HQ still there ? <P> Enemy mines haphazard the roads , enemy mortars control the passes , enemy snipers infest the fields . In 15 miles the lieutenant loses two men , and when he gets to Hill 465. he finds-enemy machine-gun nests . The picture ends with a battle for a hill that probably means nothing to either side . <P> The film has its weaknesses . S.O.P. aside , the relations between the lieutenant and the sergeant are literary , to say the least . But the characters are not . They typify believably the two best kinds of fighting men . The lieutenant is the steady , intelligent , responsible leader of men ; the sergeant is the gifted killer . On Director , Anthony Mann 's restraining leash , Actors Ryan and Ray work with a held-back intensity that admirably suggests the low-grade , chronic anxiety that fighting men run like a fever .               @ @ @ @ @ @
