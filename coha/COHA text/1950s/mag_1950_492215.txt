Thum ? : 111101 25 AI.Curs1 19 19. a HE skipper of the USS Cochin ? , Comdr . Rafael Benitez , of Groton , Conn. , lost his balance and fell against the conning-tower bulkhead . " Damn those seas ! " The ship careened violently . Benitez picked himself up , raced down the ladder to the Control Room , one deck below . " Get the battle-stations men on the controls ! " His experienced crew battled the boat to proper depth . The Cochino jolted again , Benitez gasped as he saw the hydrogen indicator swing into the red , dan ger sector . He grabbed the microphone ; all over the ship the dreaded warning screamed from the loud-speakers , " Hydrogen ! Put out the Smoking Lamp ! " Sailors frantically extinguished their cigarettes . A chief petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee . Before Benitez could issue another order , a shock wave whipped through the Cochin ? and with a heavy thud pounded against the steel bulkheads . The door of the Control Room banged open . Men jostled through , yelling , " Fire ! " Acrid fumes swirled in . Commander Benitez coughed as he said to the Diving A POST DOUBLE-LENGTH ARTICLE COMPLETE IN THIS ISSUE Officer , Lieutenant Clifford , of New London , Connecticut , " Surface her quick . I 'll signal the Tusk that we have a fire and are coming up . " Time ; 0803 . The Tusk was three miles away and also submerged . The message had to be sent by sonar  --  which was not too reliable . Benitez 's wiry figure scrambled back up the ladder to the conning tower . He called down the hatch , " Stand by to surface ! " " All vents shut , sir ! Both plants running ! Ready to surface ! " " Surface her ! " " Blow bow buoyancy ! Blow forward group ! Blow noisily into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e gr uo u rushed planeamen put full rise on the hydroplanes . Angling sharply , the boat shot up like a porpoise . There was no doubt when she hit the surface . The ship 's motion changed abruptly . Down below , Benitez heard men swear as some were knocked over . The Cochino rolled and pitched unpredictably . Now , thought Benitez , in addition to explosions and fire , the ship has to fight the weather too . Reaching over his head , the skipper opened the hatch leading to the weather bridge . This was his and station . Wind whistled and water slopped through the partially open hatch . He climbed to the bridge , Quartermaster Joseph T. Stroz , of Newark , New Jersey , coming after him . The open bridge protruded from the main deck like a ten-foot can on a waterlogged raft . Icy waves spouted over it , drenching Benitez ; he shivered and his teeth chattered . He and Stroz careened from port to starboard as high waves tossed the Cochino . They clung to the windbreak with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could maneuver , and ultimately could be ventilated . Benitez searched the ocean carefully . Fog limited his vision . He could n't use his glasses because of the spray . The intercom squawk box sounded off loudly next to him . The deep voice of Lieut . Comdr . Richard Wright , of San Francisco , thundered out , " Captain from Executive Officer ! " " Go ahead , " said Benitez , grabbing the squawk box for balance . " The fire 's in After Battery . Short circuit . " A thumping sound came out of the squawk box , as if someone had stumbled and fallen against Wright . " Captain ? " " Go ahead . " " Smoke and heat have driven everyone from the compartment . We 've thrown in CO-two fire extinguishers . I ' ? be in the Forward Engine Room , sir . " Commander Benitez 's tanned face paled . A more serious accident could n't have happened . This was more dangerous than being depth-charged . There were a million things he wanted to know . How extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Was everyone positively out of the compart-ment ? But all he replied over the squawk box was , " Very well . Take charge and keep me informed . " Off the starboard bow , the Tusk broke through the mist like a ghost ship . " Thank God , she got our message , " said Benitez . Lowering his eyes to his own ship , he saw a foot or two of green water churn over the Cochino 's deck . Spray and rain rattled against the superstructure . Benitez winced as the drops stung his face . Lieutenant Clifford stuck his head out of the hatch . He shouted up , but the storm dissipated his voice . Benitez cupped his ear and raised his eyebrows inquiringly . Clifford wormed out of the hatch , came close and yelled , " Gas ! Smells like burned rubber ! A lot of guys are passing out , sir ! " " Get all hands topside . . . quick ! " Clifford gestured about the cramped bridge , designed to hold seven persons . " There 're about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat to port , buffeting Clifford against the side of the bridge . " Get the men up here ! " said Benitez . " Stroz ! Stroz ! Stand by to lash them to the main deck by the fairwater . Break out plenty of line . Make damn sure you have a line on you before you go out there . We do n't want anyone overboard . " , Commander R. C. Ben i tez , of the Cochin'o , WaTto Horribly burned in a gallant effort to save the Cochin ? , Lieut . Comdr . R. NI . Wright , her Executive give that hardest of all orders : Abandon ship ! Officer , is now recovering in the Naval Hospital at Neu-port , R. I .. where Mrs. Wright can be with him . Benitez called into the phone , " Fire Party , this is the captain . Let me talk to the Executive Officer . " " Wright speaking , sir . " He sounded far away . " There 's gas forward . How is it back there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Battery Room . No ventilation . Another explosion any second , maybe . " " What ? " " Another explosion any second , maybe . We got to eliminate the short circuit to stop the hydrogen . Martinez is in the Maneuvering Room , trying to clear the circuits now . Sir , I 'm in a bellova hurry . " " How many men aft ? " " Five in the Fire Party , sir . Thirteen in engineering spaces . " " Very well . " Benitez did n't ask Wright for details . Wright was an experienced officer . When he was ready to report , he 'd do it . But Benitez said aloud to himself , " Let 's see . Seventy-eight men on board . Eighteen aft . That means I 've got exactly sixty forward to take care of . " He lashed the conning-tower hatch open , so it would n't slam on the men now struggling up from the fume-filled sections of the ship . The unconscious gas victims were lifted through the hatch first . Up came John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyeballs rolled up into his head . Stroz grabbed him under the armpits , tried to tug him through the narrow opening . But the deck was slippery and Stroz fell . Benitez gave Stroz a hand . One by one , they pulled the gassed men  --  eight of them ? to the bridge level and piled them in the corner . A wave lashed over the bridge ; the unconscious men stirred and groaned . The men waiting below in the conning tower cursed as the water spilled down on them too . Chief Hospital Corpsman Hubert Eason , of Gatesville , North Carolina , began applying artificial respiration to Haney . As more sailors hoisted themselves out the hatch , Benitez saw that many shivered in underclothes . They had been asleep and had no time to grab clothing . He quailed at sending them out on the freezing deck , but there was no choice . They 'd last for a couple of hours before exposure got them . However , if they remained below they 'd probably all die in a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men were all gooseflesh ; they held their arms tightly to their chests , trying to keep out the biting wind and spray . Now the bridge was packed and no more could come up . Two of them tended Stroz 's line as he made his way outside to the wave-swept deck . Then they followed , one at a time , Stroz directing them as they hit the deck . Shivering and tense , they stood ankle-deep in water while he passed lines across their chests , lashing them to the superstructure . " Bear a hand ! " shouted Benitez . " We 've got to get the rest out from down below ! " The ship lurched and pitched . But the men kept coming up , some bruised , one bleeding from being knocked against a sharp corner . Up to the bridge they came , out to the exposed deck , where Stroz secured them to the superstructure . Benitez selected a few key men to help him on the bridge  --  a signalman , a telephone talker and a few experienced officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelling Doc Eason on the artificial respiration . All the gassed men except Haney had regained consciousness . The last man , Chief Torpedoman 's Mate Mahlon P. Woodward , of Groton , Conn. , now climbed from the forward helow-decks sections . Thirteen crowded on the bridge , forty-seven were lashed outside . A wave swallowed the entire stern of the Cochino . The ship plunged into the trough , water raging over the men tied to the superstructure . Benitez heard the cry , " Man overboard ! Morgan 's overboard to port ! " Then he , too , saw the head of Joseph Morgan , of Raleigh , North Carolina , bobbing like a flyspeck among the whitecaps . Maneuvering frantically , he tried to close the flyspeck ; he could n't bring the bow to the man . Occasionally the propellers raced in the air . Morgan made no move to swim to the ship . Immersion in the cold water had already done him in . Chief Torpedoman 's Mate Hubert Rauch , of Jamaica , New York , clambered down from the bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leaped over the side and went after Morgan . In ten minutes he had him alongside . But now Rauch , too , was weak and began losing his grip on Morgan . Benitez saw one of the men pull himself free from the line holding him to the superstructure and run forward . Small and red-headed , it was Clarence Balthrop , of Nashville , Tennessee , the ship 's cook . He made his way across the rolling deck , balancing himself like a tightrope walker  --  his arms outstretched  --  shifting his weight instantly by instinct . The Cochino plunged under another wave . " Get a line on ! " Benitez screamed . It was too late . Balthrop already was over the side . Almost immediately he was at the right spot ; he grabbed Morgan away from Rauch . Rauch was pulled back aboard . TIME : 0836 . As hands reached down for Balthrop , the ship convulsed all over , as if a mine had exploded under it . The steel under Benitez trembled , and a muffled roar reverberated from below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound that the guts of his ship had been blown askew inside . Hoping that the hull had n't been ruptured , he nevertheless patted the knife in his pocket , in case the men on deck had to be cut loose . But he did n't take his eyes from the two men in the water . A wave lifted the ship , then sucked it down under , dragging Balthrop and the unconscious Morgan along . Balthrop had no line on , and Benitez did n't expect to see either of the men again . The ship began rising on the next wave , and Benitez ; ea , . , , vd on Page 50 ) MIRACLE UNDER THE ARCTIC SEA ( Con t intred from Page 19 ) could feel by the motion that she still had buoyancy and was n't sinking . The telephone talker said excitedly , " Captain , there 's been a terrible explosion aft ! Five men badly injured ! They need the hospital corpsman and medical supplies ! " " Very well , " said the Old Man , concentrating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his eyes away he might lose sight of them . Should the storm wrench the men away from the hull , they might never be seen again . As the wave receded , Balthrop appeared in view , sputtering water , his arms thrust through the limberholes which drain the outer hull . Hanging on to the side of the ship , he maintained a scissor grip on Morgan with his legs . He looked like a water spaniel retrieving a dead bird . For a moment the waves neutralized each other and the boat lay still . Morgan and Balthrop were yanked aboard . The semiconscious Morgan was carried to the bridge : Balthrop , grinning triumphantly , followed . Time ; 0841 . " Now , " said the Old Man , " to find out what the hell 's happening below . " While Balthrop struggled to rescue Morgan , Electrician 's Mate Oscar Martinez , of Poquonock Bridge , Connecticut , was in the Maneuvering Room below . Working the control panel , he tried desperately to locate and clear the havoc-making electrical arcs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the shorts still existed . Then he saw from the ammeters that the giant Battery 3 was discharging power into Battery 4 , causing the generation of hydrogen . Now he had pin-pointed the trouble ! Lieutenant Commander Wright , in the Forward Engine Room , saw Martinez running up to him , panting and out of breath . " Sir ! I 've pulled all the switches aft ! The trouble 's between Batteries Three and Four ! " he said . " Three and Four ? " " Yes , sir . We got to pull the disconnects in the Battery Room . It 's our only answer . " " I 'm going in ! " " You 'll never get out alive , sir ! " " Give me the rescue breathing apparatus , " Wright said to the sailor who was putting it on . Martinez repeated , " You 'll never get out alive , sir . " " By God , give it to me ! " said Wright , jerking the rescue breathing apparatus from the man 's hands . He thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and inserted the canister . Breathing in heavily , he activated the oxygen supply and tested to make sure there was no leakage . He tugged at the apparatus from all angles , then handed the safety line to a member of the Fire Party . " You know the signals ? One pull means give me more line . Two pulls means take out the slack , Three means to drag me the hell out of the place . " " Yes , sir . " " Now get back ... go way aft by the bulkhead . " Martinez interrupted . " Wait ! You need rubber gloves ! " he said , running aft . He returned with them in a moment . Wright put them on , sprang to the door , grabbed the quick-opening lever . He jumped back . The hot metal burned his hands through the gloves . A hollow boom , like a ' small explosion , echoed from the Battery Room . The tiny voice from inside the mask said , " If we do n't do something quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grabbing the handle with both hands , Wright used his weight to heave down and aft . The door still would n't open . Wright felt the burns on his hand where they had contacted the hot steel . But in his anxiety to get into the room and pull the switches , he did n't think about them . He burled his 200 pounds against the door and yanked . The door opened and Wright fell backward . The released gas whistled out , followed by billows of black smoke . He breathed hard . The rescue breathing apparatus functioned and the air , although hot , entered his lungs pure . In the rear of the compartment be heard someone cough deep from his stomach , and he wondered if this was the same noxious gas the captain had mentioned . Starting forward , Wright lighted his flashlight . Now he smelled acrid gas even through the breathing apparatus . There was so much smoke in the Engine Room that he could n't make out anything . The flashlight stabbed into the smoke for about a foot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the switches in the Battery Room . He saw a brilliant white flash which immediately turned orange , and then felt himself struck in the body by a great hammer and battered through space . Wright had been by the Battery Room door when the avalanche of white flame belched out , engulfing him and blowing him backward . He lay on the deck , almost naked ; all his clothes except his shoes had been burned off . Long tongues of exploding hydrogen followed the first roar , swirling about Wright , licking the other members of the Fire Party and starting fires throughout the compartment . With almost the entire front of his body charred , Wright dragged himself off the deck and flung himself against the door . Placing his skinless hands on the wheel , he painfully pushed on the door . It resisted , the pressure still trying to vent itself . He slowly closed the door and , inch by inch , secured it . While Wright labored the door shut , the other members of the Fire Party , also burned , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Forward Engine Room blazed . Above the crackling and swishing of the flames they heard the engines whining with speed and thundering with explosion . Even in the burning hell about them , they realized what had happened : the Diesel engines normally were powered by air mixing with oil fumes . Now some explosive hydrogen had got into the mixture and the Diesels had gone berserk . The excessive speed might cause them to disintegrate at any moment . ( Continued on Page 52 ) ( Guar iarted front Page 30 ) Engineman William Payne , of Groton , Connecticut , and Engineman George Fedon , of Pennsauken , New Jersey , both badly burned , jumped to the engines , swiftly threw the levers shutting off the fuel supply . As Wright turned from his now-dogged door , the source of hydrogen was sealed and the hydrogen-crazed engines began to slow . The other members of the Fire Party made their way from the fiery compartment back into the After Engine Room . Wright faced aft . The one piece of fabric left on his front  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chest were the only unseared parts of his body . He stood still for a moment , screaming in a high-pitched voice , " We got ta save her ! " and then shuffled aft . There was n't much skin left . The raw muscles in his arms and legs jerked spasmodically , as in a diagram from a medical textbook . With a drunkard 's little steps , Wright dragged himself along . He fell , and painfully crawled through the flames on his bands and knees until he reached the After Engine Room . Struggling to his feet , he dogged the door behind him and lunged through the compartment . It was harder holding his balance now , and he had to move ahead quickly to keep from falling . His eyes were glazed and his arms hung in front of him like charred tree stumps as he jerked along , ever with smaller and faster steps . Upon reaching the Maneuvering Room , he was met by shipmates , who caught him as he dropped , and who gently carried him to a bunk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments , his seared skin pressing against the blankets and his blackened hand hanging over the bunk pipe . Soon the shock began to wear off . Wright whimpered softly . The men on watch in the After Engine Room and the Torpedo Room gave the five injured men first aid . Wright was in the worst state , but the others had their hair burned , their faces blistered and the skin loosened from their hands , like gloves . After the small supply of petrolatum from the emergency chest was used up , the amateur doctors smeared the burned men with ball-bearing grease . That was the best they had . From forward came another loud thud . Martinez ran aft . " We 've lost ansiliary power ! " An engineman stuck his head in the door , shouting , " The after Diesels have knocked off ! Nothing 's running now ! " The burned men in the hunks felt the motion of the Cochin ? in the storm change again . A ship without propulsion has a sickening pitch to it . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do ? " growled Martinez . " Why , we 're going to get off our butte and get this bucket running again ! What do you think ? " Up on the bridge , Commander Benitez listened to the reports from the After Torpedo Room and appraised the situation . Two compartments below raged with flame  --  although he had heard that Chief Engineman Harold Spanne , of Groton , Connecticut , was leading a fire-fighting party into the Forward Engine Room . Hydrogen and noxious flames were still being generated in After Battery . The Cochin had no electricity or propulsion . Like a dead fish , she drifted inert on the surface , buffeted willy-nilly by the wind and water . Five men in the Torpedo Room lay seriously injured , one of them likely to die any moment . The thirteen others also isolated below complained of headaches  --  some of the gas had leaked aft . I3enitez looked down ; all of the gassed men topside had regained full consciousness . " Thank God , " he said . But outside , exposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashed to the handrail around the bridge . Benitez saw them cringe when the ship rolled and another wave approached . How long can they last ? he thought . Immediately after the first big explosion , Commander Benitez had signaled the Tusk : REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE . Benitez now saw that the Tusk was closing him and preparing to send over a rubber boat with supplies . It frightened him to watch her . One moment he saw nothing but the Tusk 's underbelly , the next second she rblled the other way with only her bridge and deck showing . Benitez assigned several men to go to the fo'c'sle . They caught the Line shot over from the Tusk and , hauling in , ( Con f irtrred on Page .55 ) // ( Con ed irons Page 52 ) pulled the raft across the two hundred yards of high waves . Commander Benitez beckoned to Lieut. ( jg ) Charles Cushman and Ensign John Shelton , both of Norfolk , Virginia . They stepped close . " John , " Benitez said to Shelton , " do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tusk ? They should be told what 's going on . . . just in case . " " I ca n't hear you , captain , " said Shelton , pointing out at the storm . Benitez repeated , shouting . " Yea , sir ; at least I 'd like to try . " Robert Philo , a civilian electronics expert from Newark , New Jersey , spoke up , " He 'll need help , captain . I 'd like to go too . " " Are you sure you want to go ? " " Yes . " " Very well . " Shelton and Philo adjusted their life jackets , then inflated them . Clambering down the side of the bridge , they reached the deck level . Benitez watched them crawl forward to the fo'c'sle on their hands and knees . Benitez turned to Lieutenant Cushman . " Cushman , I 'm going to ask you to do something very hazardous . " He pointed aft . " The stern 's under water most of the time . I want you to run a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies can get to the after torpedo hatch and to the men below . " " I 'll start now , " said Cushman . The wind shrieked extra loud , drowning him out . He repeated , " I 'll start now , sir . " Benitez put his arm around him . " Look , boy , I did n't have to hear you to know what your answer was . " Thee : 1121 . Up on the fo'c'sle , John Shelton and Robert Philo each stood on one side of the rubber raft . Shelton said , " Bob , when she stops tossing for a second , we 'll shove off . We 'll ride this baby like a surfboard . Savvy ? " " Yes . " The Cochino steadied . " Hit it ! " They sprang out parallel to the water , pushing the raft before them , but the ocean had deceived them ; the wave , instead of receding when at deck level , kept rising , lifting the Cochino with it . The raft capsized as it hit the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their life jackets shot them to the surface , and they grabbed the bottom strap of the raft . The line from the Tusk to the raft tautened and the raft moved toward the Tusk . Sometimes Shelton and Philo were submerged ; sometimes the waves lifted them so high that they saw both submarines at the same time . " Hold on , Bob ! " " 1 got it ! " In five minutes they were alongside the plunging Tusk . Seaman Norman H. Walker , of Peterboro , Canada , lowered himself over the side and secured a line about Philo 's waist . A triple wave came , sucking the Tusk down , elevating it , then battering it down again . Philo hanged against the hull and went limp . The force of the wave jerked Shelton from the raft and swept him about a hundred yards from the Tusk . Time : 11211 . Comdr . Robert Worthington , of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , the skipper of the Tusk , had pretty much guessed what had happened aboard the Cochino . For the last hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind and sea prevented him . He had watched the progress of Shelton and Philo from the Cochino to his own ship . He had seen Philo knocked unconscious and Shelton torn from the raft . Luckily , Shelton had caught on to the raft again and was ( Continued on Page 57 ) till ' Curelt lll wd from Page 571 glassy-eyed , the cold water pouring over them . Only three hours ago these men had been his shipmates , his friends . Corning forward , he reached Lieut . Bill Shafer 's room . Bill had been one of his closest friends  --  now he 'd never see him again . Last month Commander Worthington had written on his fitness report : " For his age and experience , Lieutenant Shafer is one of the finest officers I 've ever served with . " On Bill Shafer 's bunk lay Lieut . Philip B. Pennington , the husky officer who had stayed alive in the water for almost two hours . The captain touched him tenderly . " Thanks , Phil , for fighting so hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went in and drew the curtains . He wept . A messenger called in from the passageway , saying that the Cochin was now in sight . Worthington started topside , but when he reached the bridge , he found that his two hours of out-shouting the gale had strained his larynx . He could n't utter a sound . Lieutenant Commander Cook , the Executive Officer , began maneuvering the Tusk . When the Tusk pulled away from the Cochin , disappearing into the rain , neither Commander Benitez nor anyone else in his ship knew that the Tusk was trying to rescue her own men . Benitez had signaled that he might have to abandon the Cochino . Without replying , the Tusk departed from the immediate area . Well , thought Benitez , we 've got to stick it out some way . But what could he do ? His ship had no electricity or propulsion . She wallowed crazily in the gale , tons of water pouring over her , freezing and choking all hands  --  especially the crew lashed outside to the superstructure . Benitez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths strangely silent . They had ceased cringing as the cold water poured over the deck . The men sat there passively . Benitez turned to Chief Torpedoman 's Mate Woodward . " Woodward , get a safety line on . " " Aye , aye , sir . " " Get all the men up here , " " Up here on the bridge , sir ? " " Yes . We 're going to pack them in , " Woodward climbed down to the main deck and unlashed the men one at a time . Slowly they made their way to the bridge . Benitez watched the slow progress . The slower the better , he thought . It 'll occupy their minds . They wo n't start wondering why the Tush pulled away . It 'll give them some movement and a change of scenery . Benitez turned to the people already on the bridge . " You think we can squeeze forty-seven men up here ? " No one replied . Benitez said , " It 's your job to see that forty-seven can squeeze in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a large man in the opening over there ? a small one in the tiny space by the bulkhead . . . . You sit on his lap , Bob . . . Push over , you guys ; twenty-four more have to pile on top of you . Benitez watched and knew that his men were now his chief concern . If he could rouse their spirits , they 'd last longer . But he began to wonder how long he would last himself . He had had only three hours ' sleep the night before , and already he felt weak and tired . His eyes smarted . But , he thought , they 're looking to me . I got to keep up the old coop . Clifford said aloud , " My damn feet are freezing . " Benitez removed his shoes ? standing where all the men could see ? and handed them to Clifford . " No , sir , thank you very much . " " Put them on , " said Benitez loudly . " I 'm okay , captain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benitez fell backward , almost dropping the shoes overboard . Getting up , he thrust them into Clifford 's hands , " I said to put them on . " ? Benitez took off his jacket and sweater , which he gave to the Coldest-looking men . The wind clawed at the commander now , for be stood on the highest part of the bridge , where it blew hardest . He found his kneecaps jumping and his teeth chattering . I ca n't look cold , he said to himself . He tried to stop his teeth and kneecaps from moving , but could n't control them . From way aft came a thud ! thud ! as if the hydrogen explosions had finally blown their way through the steel bull . The stern rose out of the water and Benitez heard the noise again ... but it was the cough of spluttering Diesels . They hacked a few times and stopped . The telephone talker shouted , " Captain , After Engine Room says the electricians have auxiliary power hooked ! In a few minutes maybe ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed and roared and thundered over the gale . The fifty-eight sailors on the bridge brightened . Benitez 's chapped face twisted into a smile . Now his ship was alive again . Now she could move . Now he could get her to land , two hundred miles away ... maybe . Now , he could get his men to safety . The telephone talker broke in , " Captain , Davis says they got two engines going and are working the rudder by hand power , so not to go too fast . " A great cheer from the men rose , " The Tusk ! The Tusk ! " Benitez looked . There she came out of the fog . She looked like a black matchstick on a blowing whipped-cream ocean , but there she was . He heard the buzz 9f his own men 's conversations . They started joking . jun " eery 14 , 1950 Time : 15211 . The two ships headed for nearest land , the Tusk leading . For five hours the battered Cochino limped and fought to maintain her speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis steered by hand , manipulating the rudder control with a wrench . Benitez received reports of conditions below decks . The men in the after compartments had headaches and nausea , from fatigue and from fumes . " But , captain , we promise we 'll keep the ship going somehow . " The telephone talker described how Lieutenant Commander Wright , though almost dying , had led the engineers in song . " He could n't keep a tune , captain , but when we saw that battered guy trying to cheer us ? He 's sleeping now , sir . Doc gave him another shot . " Time : 2039 . Benitez felt the Cochin leap beneath him , and then jump again , and again . He heard the roar of an explosion , only this time it was n't muffled and contained within the ship . Something had given way . Perhaps the steel hull had split ? From the snorkel mat a column of smoke spiraled and billowed . He saw the Tusk , a mile in front of him , half hidden by waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Engine Room 's on fire and is filled with gas . It 's been abandoned . " " Order all hands to come topside ! Signalman ! Tell the Tusk to hurry , that we need help ! " " Sir , " said the bridge phone talker , " I do n't get any response from below . Either the phone 's burned out or they have all passed out . " Benitez looked aft . The stern had settled in the water about a foot . Water slopped over the After Torpedo Room hatch , the one by which the men below had to escape . He saw Seaman Willard S. Whitman , of Hibbing , Minnesota , jump off the bridge onto the deck , plow his way through the waves aft , and open the hatch . On the starboard bow , the Tusk had circled to make an approach . It seemed as if she 'd never arrive . The distance between the ships slowly closed . Now she came near enough for Benitez to C-tattinaed en Page 52 ) 62 TM : SATURDAY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The waves heaved her first one way and then the next . One mistake in seamanship and the boats might ram each other , perhaps sinking the Tusk . In . . ? in .. . in she came . . . now only fifty yards away . Benitez glanced quickly aft . The men had started out the hatch . Time : 2155 . Except for Lieutenant Commander Wright and Doc Eason , the after torpedo room was empty . Water sloshed about the deck . The water swished and gurgled from one side of the compartment to the other . Wright lay naked on the bunk , his seared and blistered skin covered by a blanket . The morphine had n't worn off yet and he rested easily . With half-shut eyes , he had watched the others climb the hatch to topside . " That leaves you and me alone , eh , Doc ? " " Yes , sir . But I already sent Fedon up to say we 're coming . " " Topside ? I 'm staying here . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm comfortable now . Nothing 'll happen to the ship . She 's still on an even keel . " " The captain said to come to the bridge . " " The captain did ? " " Yes , sir , " said Eason , removing the blanket from Wright . Wright raised his head and looked at his burned body . The fluid which had oozed from the raw flesh had solidified into a crust . Slowly he lowered one leg at a time over the side of the bunk , while holding his blackened arms in the **34;3736;TOOLONG . " The Old Man ordered us topside , eh , Doc ? " " Yes , sir , " said Eason , placing his hands on Wright 's back and pushing . " Now try to get up . Hold yourself stiff . " Wright heard a deafening clang and was thrown out of the bunk as the Cochin() collided with something . " What the hell ! " " Tusk coming alongside , sir . Now , damn it , we 've got to get the hell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt rakes plowing up his flesh as Eason pulled a pair of trousers over his caked legs . The crust over his burns broke and the ooze began to flow again . He saw the round spots soak through the dungaree trousers . The pants were too small and would hardly fit over his hips . The fly remained unbuttoned at the top . Eason guided him toward the ladder , sort of steering him by putting pressure on the small of his back , supporting him when the ship rolled by holding him up on his least-burned areas . Wright moved a little at a time , shuffling flat-footed along the deck . The ship lurched and took on a list to starboard . Before Wright made it across the compartment , the Cochino visibly increased her angle . The water on the deck grew deeper . Wright reached the ladder , standing there motionless as perspiration dripped down his face . He knew that no one could carry him up and that he had to make it alone . He also knew it was impossible . The muscles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't lift his foot to the first rung , let alone drag his two hundred pounds of aching body up the long stretch to the main deck . The ship lurched , banging him against the ladder , scraping off more of the crust . The morphine wore off all at once and deep pains swelled through him like a fever . EVENING POST Someone shouted down the hatch , " Hurry , Mr. Wright , or it 'll be too late ! " Wright tried to draw from some hidden source of strength ; he tried to will himself up the ladder . The muscles up and down his back twitched.and trembled . More perspiration dripped from his face . But he could n't even raise his arms . The ship heeled over more . Wright felt Eason trying to push him  --  unsuccessfully  --  up the ladder . " My God , " said Wright aloud , " I 'm blocking Eason 's chances . " He looked up at the patch of gray sky . ? way . way up ? shining through the hatch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of here , and so does Eason . Lord , you 've got to give me a hand up the ladder ! " Suddenly Wright felt himself being lifted up the ladder , his hands and feet barely touching the rungs . Halfway up , the overhang stopped him . Eason gave him a shove , and he went the rest of the way . As he stuck his head out the hatch , the excruciating pain and the paralysis returned . He could n't budge from the narrow hatch . But Whitman , who had remained at the hatch , reached under his armpits and dragged him out . He now saw for the first time that the Tusk was alongside . held to the sinking Cochino by mooring lines . A sailor led him forward toward the bridge . The seas broke over the deck , hitting him full and almost washing him over . But he held tight to the life line , getting rope burns on his already charred hands . He saw the rest of his shipmates huddling by the bridge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossing to the Tusk . As he got closer , he saw the maw:l . The lurching , bucking ships were separated by about twenty feet . The only escape to the Tusk was over a narrow plank . It was wet , and as the storm heaved the ships , the plank teetered and swayed . If a man slipped while crossing , he 'd be smashed between the steel hulls . Up by the bridge the men were awed by the wild motion of the two ships . They realized the tremendous hazards of abandoning to the Tusk . Someone said , " Here comes Mr. Wright . " All eyes flashed aft . They saw the grimacing Wright , helped by Whitman , squeeze himself out of the hatch . They saw him stumble forward , hardly able to walk , his head down , bent over , his discolored hands clutching the line as if it were barbed wire . Three quarters of the way forward he stopped ; a big wave lashed over the starboard side . Wright stumbled under the impact , but Whitman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright look at them inquiringly . They saw him open his mouth , mumbling to himself , close his eyes and take a deep , deep breath . Yanking his falling trousers with one hand , holding Innuary 14. 19541 ? on to the line with the other , he walked  --  rapidly now , no more painful shuffling ? to the fo'c'sle where the crew had gathered . Wright stood in front of them and , with effort , pulled up the corners of his mouth . The crew saw him ? this man with his raw hands , with his hair burned off , almost his entire body a puddle of welts and blisters  --  they saw him try to grin . They cheered . No one spoke ; Wright stepped toward the teetering plank , stood there . For a moment the two deck levels were at the same height ; the plank , though swaying , lay horizontal . Wright staggered on to the plank , started over to the Tusk . The gale lifted the ships when he was midway , but lunging forward , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him . " My hands ! " he said . " Do n't touch my hands ! " His eyes dimmed ; the spark went out a bit , but Lieutenant Commander Wright kept moving . Back on the Cochino , the men followed Wright 's example , running over to the Tusk when the plank lay horizontal . The Cochin listed badly now , her stern almost submerged . But all the crew had escaped except Chief Torpedoman 's Mate Woodward and Commander Benitez . Then Woodward made it . The Cochino 's bow pointed at an angle . The axman on the Tusk began to chop away the strained mooring lines . The sinking motion of the Co-chino brought the ships a few feet closer and miraculously  --  for a moment  --  the plank stayed steady . Every person aboard the Tusk shouted , " Now ! " Time : 2229 . Commander Benitez ran across . As he reached the Tusk , the plank fell between the ships . The Co-chino 's bow shot into the air and the ship slid under the surface , making her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? " " They 're in good hands , Benny . " The next day the Tusk reached Hammerfest , Norway . After rest and hospitalization , both crews rode the Tusk back to the United States Submarine Base at New London , Connecticut . That 's where they are now . Lieutenant Commander Wright is convalescing from his burns and is coming along fine . The two commanding officers , Comdr . Robert Worthington and Comdr . Rafael Benitez , wrote a full report of their cruise . Because of the special equipment in the boats , some of the report is confidential . But at the end they listed the men whose heroism and devotion to duty they particularly noted : Lieutenant Commander Cook ... Guttermuth . . . Norman Walker .. . Shugar . . . Henry McFarland . . Lieutenant Commander Wright . . . Lieutenant ( jg ) Cushman ... Rauch ... Balthrop Spanne ... Woodward ... Whitman . . . Payne . . Robert Davis . . . Fedon and Haney . The commanding officer of the Co-chino concluded the report with : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt there were others who in-conspicuously performed deeds worthy of special recognition . To them we apologize for our failure to observe their conduct and for not singling them out . Their reward , if they feel they need any , they must . find in their own hearts ? that when duty called they were not found wanting . " THE END
