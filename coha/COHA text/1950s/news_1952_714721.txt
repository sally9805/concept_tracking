txt A. , few days ago , in Dubuque , Iowa , Secretary of Labor Tobin delivered the commencement address at Loras College . Opening that address , he told his listeners : " In the young people * * * lies the hope for the future of Am Pica .. They must . face the perils that an older generation has been wrestling with so desperately . # * * The problems and the perils seem to be overwhelming ; but * * * the young people . face - the future with courage and determination . They are not afraid . " Is Mr. Tobin suggesting that college graduates of 1952 face an almost insupportable struggle to obtain a livelihood ? - It would be difficult to reconcile such a statement with recent surveys conducted on .  --  the college . campuses of the nation . Such a survey was made by The Wall Street Journal . " A chemistry-majoring senior at Western Reserve , " it , found , " ca n't make up his mind to take a job at $525 a month . " Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it found , " will be starting to work for stipends as huge as $250 a Month against a top last year of UM . " Perhaps the best statement of the prospects fornewly graduated technical experts was - credited to E. H. Flath of Southern Methodist School of Engineer0g , Commented Dean Flath , " If an engineering grad is breathing , he has a job . " What , then , is this dread problem that the current college graduate has to grapple with that makes his future so " perilous " ? Well ; it'stenis from the ' fact , one gathers , that " where a hundred years ago most Americans worked for themselves , today , by'contrast , they work for others . " But ' if our land frontiers are now gone , Mr. Tobin pointed out , there are other frontiers , notably " the ' labor movement . " " The razorsharp edge of the new social order , " he said , " is in the field of labor and industrial relations . Lifetime careers are open there , whether for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobin 's emphasis on the changed " social order " of today provides a field for speculative observation . In the first place , when we Contemplate the fact that some 2.5 million new business enterprises . have been born in the last five years , it seems a little premature to suggest that the long cherished opportunity for an American to go into business for himself has vanished from the face of the earth or is in process of doing so . But would we , as a practical matter , be prepared to pay the ' price of a return to , say , the situation which prevailed around 1900 ? Those were the " good old days " when only one American home in seven boasted a bath tub ; one in thirteen had a telephone , and one in thirty electric lights . But the nostalgic note of Mr. Tobin raises more important questions than this . Is it possible to believe that the United Nations would , have dictated the terms of surrender at Potsdam in 1945-had we , in 1941 , been organized on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That leads more or less inevitably to other questions  --  questions such as that of Big Government . In returning to 1900 , for example , we would be going back to a point in time when the federal budget was less than $1 billion and when there were only 250,000 civil employes . In fact , our living standard at that time was so modest , come to think of it , that it did n't even include the luxury of a Secretary of Labor .
