Labor unionists who are attracted by the device of Government seizure of industry last week had a bitter object lesson to ponder . <P> In August 1950 , the President seized the nation 's railroads to prevent a strike . Four months later , the policy boards of the four brotherhoods involved-the trainmen , conductors , engineers and firemen-rejected a settlement proposed by Presidential Assistant John R. Steelman . Truman accused the union officials of acting like a bunch of Russians . He stayed mad . <P> The trainmen settled a year ago , but the other three unions held out until last week . What they agreed to ( increases from 22 to 37 an hour ) was essentially what Steelman had proposed nearly two years ago . <P> Said a union statement : " There are no better alternatives under one-sided Government seizure and rule by labor injunction . " A few days later Truman turned the roads back to their owners , who had , in fact , been running them all through the period of " seizure . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
