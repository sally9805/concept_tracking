A psychiatrist in California believes that insanity is nothing but a breakdown in ability to communicate. * <P> In collaboration with British-born Anthropologist Gregory Bateson , Swiss-born Dr. Jurgen Ruesch has written Communication , the Social Matrix of Psychiatry ( Norton ; $4.50 ) , in an attempt to tie insanity and psychiatry with communication engineering and other sciences ( among them , cybernetics ) into a single system . Samples from Ruesch 's chapters : <P> " Interference with goal-directed behavior of an individual gives rise to the alarm reaction . If the interference can be successfully disposed of or avoided altogether , the alarm reaction will recede . However , frequently the source of interference can not be avoided or eliminated . Under such circumstances , the sharing of anxiety with nonanxious or non-threatening individuals by means of communication becomes an efficient device for tolerating the impact of interference . . . <P> " Successful communication with self and with others implies correction by others as well as self-correction . In such a continuing process , up-to-date information about the self , the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition of appropriate techniques , and eventually increases the individual 's chances of mastery of life . Successful communication therefore becomes synonymous with adaptation and life . " <P> If Psychiatrist Ruesch 's definition is correct , Author Ruesch is in a pretty interesting condition himself . <P> <P> * An older definition : insanity is being in the outcast minority-i.e. , being voted insane by the majority .
