The week in which South Americans stoned the U.S. Vice President , Lebanese and Algerian rioters sacked U.S. libraries , and U.S. alliances in Europe trembled , was also the week in which the U.S. House of Representatives acted with extraordinary calm and exemplary reason . Putting down momentary anger , the House last week approved ( 259-134 ) and sent to the Senate a bill authorizing $2.9 billion in new foreign aid , $1.64 billion for military assistance , most of the rest for economic and technical development . <P> Not all the three days ' debate , to be sure , was conducted with sweetness and light . " We have not bought any friends , " thundered Michigan 's hoary ( 82 ) , unreconstructed Republican Clare Hoffman , " that is , not friends when we needed them . " Snorted Mississippi 's arch-reactionary William M. Colmer : " We have seen only in the last few days instances of the fact that this aid is not only not appreciated , but in many instances is not welcome . " In this frame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments to gut the principle of foreign aid , chiefly by slicing the total authorization or eliminating aid to Yugoslavia , Egypt , Poland and India . By wide margins , each restrictive amendment was beaten . <P> " He Shudders . " Partly their defeat lay in the fact that the current mood of Congress is for more spending , not less ; in last year 's savage attack on foreign aid , Congress was still shivering from George Humphrey 's prediction of a " depression that will curl your hair " if spending continued . Partly the victory came because foreign-aid advocates approached this year 's battle well prepared . Acting Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Thomas E. Morgan of Pennsylvania and energetic new Director James Smith Jr . of the International Cooperation Administration were ready with facts and figures to answer all the predictable horror stories , e.g. , that aid funds went for dress suits for Greek undertakers , bathing facilities for Egyptian camel drivers or a chinchilla coat for Zsa Zsa Gabor ( see below ) . <P> But the most important new factor was the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in committee but would accept no more . " He shudders , " reported Minority Leader Joe Martin , " to think how he could meet the world situation if there are any further cuts . " Moreover , Ike clearly made foreign aid a part of his three-point Republican loyalty test ( TIME , May 19 ) . Backing up the President , Joe Martin scoured the House for more G.O.P. votes , added an angry floor argument : " The charge that we can not afford the mutual-security program is hogwash . When the U.S. can not afford its own security , it is time to hoist the white flag . " <P> " Growing Realization . " But mainly , last week 's bill passed in spite of everything because the House sensed the will of the nation . Said Indiana 's veteran Charles A. Halleck : " There is growing realization throughout the country that the far-flung defenses of the U.S. require substantial and continuing foreign aid . " <P> <P> The foreign-aid forces could only hope that such brave words would still echo when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
