The eight musicians piled their instruments on the stage of the Waldorf-Astoria ballroom , and set to work tuning them - with a sledge hammer . This did no particular damage , because the " instruments " were made from 50-gallon steel oil drums . Tuned up , the Trinidad Invaders Steel Band gave a surprised New York Herald Tribune Forum audience something far more harmonious to listen to last week than the clangorous world affairs they had been discussing . <P> Even to a man with a tin ear , oil-drum music is an advance over the ashcan-and-bottle music of the Trinidadian ' 305 . By pressing out graded circles in the bottom of a section of drum , the Invaders get a melody job ( the " ping-pong " ) with a range of two octaves . Other refinements : " alto pans , " " tune-booms. " and " bass-booms . " For their Manhattan audience . the Invaders beat their way through some celesta-like calypsos and a Mambo in F. One listener compared the sound to that of " a Jovian steel guitar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season .
