With the House off on a three-week holiday , Senators bent their backs to a grueling double chore . One was the job of cutting expenditures , in which President Truman , continually suggesting ways to spend money , gave little help . The other was to squeeze out of the taxpayers , without squeezing them dry , enough new funds to meet the huge Government outlays . <P> In one committee room the combined Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees took up the Administration 's request for $8.5 billion for foreign military and economic aid , from which the House had cut $1 billion ( some $700 million from economic aid , $300 million from the military ) . The Senate committees pretty much agreed with that reduction . Administration spokesmen protested , but Georgia 's George expressed the sentiments of a large part of the Senate : " We ought to cut out economic aid in Europe . . . Those countries already are up to about 144% of their prewar production capacity . If they ca n't stand on their own feet now , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it later . " <P> George , for his part , turned his Finance Committee to the painful problem of new taxes . Last year the Federal Government gobbled up $50 billion of the nation 's total $263 billion income . Harry Truman had asked for $10 billion more this year . The House had passed a bill calculated to give him something less than that-$7.2 billion . <P> The Senators were not certain that the country could stand as much as the House had voted . The committee tentatively voted a maximum 11% increase in personal-income taxes ( compared to the House 's flat 12.5% increase ) . The Senate 's 11% would be downgraded for taxpayers in the highest brackets , who already pay up to 91% of their incomes . The Senate also loosened some of the screws that the House would put on corporations ; e.g. , the Senate removed a 12.5% increase in capital-gains taxes . <P> Said Colorado 's Republican Eugene Millikin : " It 's the most troublesome bill we 've ever had . We are really scraping the bottom of the barrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government expenditures ? Said Millikin : " I wish I could answer yes . We simply do n't know . "
