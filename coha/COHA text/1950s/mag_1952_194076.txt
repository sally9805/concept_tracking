Forceps , scalpels , hypodermic syringes and stethoscopes are precision-made and therefore expensive . Last week the Federal Trade Commission told why , for years , they have been costing far more than they should . Each year , doctors and hospitals buy about $100 million worth of such equipment , and 90% of the business has been cornered by firms in two cozy , closely knit groups : the American Surgical Trade Association and the Manufacturers Surgical Trade Association . <P> Between them , said FTC , the two associations kept prices up by shutting out competition . The A.S.T.A. put on a campaign to convince buyers that they should do business only with its members . Then it limited membership by refusing to admit applicants on the ground that there were already enough dealers in their territory , or that they would not go along with A.S.T.A. price schedules , or that they were engaged at the same time in some other business . The M.S.T.A. persuaded manufacturers not to sell to dealers who did not have M.S.T.A. 's approval . <P> As a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both associations have now promised to give up their restrictive , price-boosting practices . Because they signed a consent decree , the details of how much they had hiked the costs of medical care and surgery were not disclosed . But it was known that on some items the markup between manufacturer and buyer ( doctor or hospital ) had been as high as 600% . In the end , of course , the patient paid .
