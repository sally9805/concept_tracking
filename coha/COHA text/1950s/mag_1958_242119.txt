In a gruffly conciliatory broadcast , Lebanon 's Premier Sami Solh informed his countrymen last week that President Camille Charroun would not seek to change the constitution so that he might be re-elected in September . Since this was what opposition rebel leaders had been agitating about ever since the insurrection broke out weeks ago , a few rebel cheers might have been expected . <P> But there were no cheers . " Too late , " cried ex-Premier Saeb Salam from his barricaded mansion in Beirut 's Moslem quarter . Two days later street fighting broke out again ; an estimated five persons were killed in Beirut and Tripoli . Next day His Beatitude Paul Meouchi , onetime Los Angeles parish priest who is now patriarch of the Maronite Roman Catholic sect to which Chamoun and most Lebanese Christians belong , said in a press conference that the President should " take a trip " abroad and turn over power to Army Chief Brigadier General Fuad Shehab . Otherwise , he warned , the half-Christian , half-Moslem republic of Lebanon might see its civil war turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there should be no further intervention in our affairs from abroad , " Lebanese Foreign Minister Charles Malik hurried to New York to press charges before the U.
