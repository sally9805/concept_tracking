His EYE Is ON THE SPARROW ( 278 pp. ) - Ethel Waters , with Charles Samuels-Doubleday ( $3 ) . <P> <P> " I never was a child . <P> " I never was coddled , or liked , or understood by my family . <P> " I never felt I belonged . <P> " I was always an outsider . <P> " I was born out of wedlock , but that had nothing to do with all this . To people like mine , a thing like that just did n't mean much . <P> " Nobody brought me up . " <P> So begins His Eye Is on the Sparrow , the autobiography of Singer-Actress Ethel Waters . It is surely one of the frankest self-revelations ever to see print , a combination of depressing sordidness and one proud Negro 's piled-up resentment against the experience of white discrimination . It is also , just as surely , an American success story . It is often vulgar to the point of endangering sympathy for its narrator . It is crudely ghost-written in a mixture of Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a final ring of truth that may account for its being a March selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club . <P> Errands to Run . Ethel Waters was born in Chester , Pa. , the daughter of a Negro girl who was raped at the age of twelve . As she remembers her childhood , it was a continuous round of poverty , filth , lust and violence . By the time she was seven , she had an adult 's knowledge of sex . Farmed out by her child-mother and her grandmother to a succession of relatives , she had a childhood " almost like a series of one-night stands . " <P> When her people moved to Philadelphia , it was to the red-light district , where Ethel , not yet six , picked up money running errands for prostitutes ; she still has " great respect " for them as " kind and generous " people . Hunger also drove her to become " a very good child thief , " and at eleven , " I had trouble getting men to leave me alone . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened . At her Roman Catholic school , she was taken into the church , and through His Eye Is on the Sparrow runs a strong if naive faith : " The Catholic religion gives you a beautiful image to cuddle . I who have always believed in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth try to get God in my corner . " <P> Most of Actress Waters ' book is an **25;3546;TOOLONG account of how she went from shimmy dancer and blues singer in mean Negro dives to better things on stage &; screen . But it is edged with appalling descriptions of racial discrimination , freely spiced with a man-by-man record of her long , disastrous and violent love life . A great actress , she has nothing important to say about acting . A vital human being , buffeted by life even in success , Ethel Waters never lets her bitterness get far offstage . But it is a story worth having for the truths it has to tell about the millions of her race who never got top billing .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
