The library or study in Andrew Wells ' apartment in New York . The room has an air of richness and taste and newness . It opens off of the entrance hall to the apartment and has but this one door . It is lined with books . There is a desk , a fireplace , a big casement window , comfortable man-sized chairs and so forth . At the rise of the curtain , ANDREW WELLS is alone in the room reading . Andrew Wells is a man about fifty years old , very American in his looks , speech and gestures . He is extremely well-tailored , but wears his clothes indifferently . He creates the impression of a man of will , drive and self-control . Enter at door NORVAL . Norval is a middle-aged colored butler an ordinary Pullman-type servant . NORVAL ( in the doorway ) There is a Mr. Harkness here , Sir . ANDREW WELLS Who ? NORVAL Mr. Harkness , Sir . He says he 's from the paper  --  from the Herald Tribune . ANDREW WELLS Oh  --  let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - puts his book aside - goes to his desk ) Enter NORVAL followed by DAVID HARKNESS.David Harkness is a young man about 30 , a successful young newspaper man , intelligent , well-mannered , knowing his way about . He is in the upper brackets . p. 3 NORVAL ( in the doorway , speaking without too much formality ) Mr. Harkness.Exit Norval . Harkness crosses to Wells ANDREW WELLS ( pleased and friendly ) Hello Dave ! ( they shake hands ) Wells likes David Harkness very particularly . He is glad to see him and treats him as a favorite guest . DAVID HARKNESS How do you do , Sir . Surprised to see me ? ( There is always a slight deference in the younger man 's manner toward the older man ) ANDREW WELLS ( sitting at his desk ) Well  --  as I see you every day down at the office ! Sit down , Dave . DAVID HARKNESS ( sitting ) Hope I 'm not disturbing you . ANDREW WELLS No - I was just loafing . DAVID HARKNESS I did n't know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again  --  Lord Jim  --  ever read it ? DAVID HARKNESS You bet ! It 's one of my favorite yarns . ANDREW WELLS Really ? I thought you young fellows would find it old hat . p. 4 DAVID HARKNESS I fell for it - but I never understood it . ANDREW WELLS ( a little irritably ) Never understood what ? DAVID HARKNESS The whole thing ! Why Lord Jim had to wander the world the way he did  --  why he suffered such a sense of guilt  --  and  --  ANDREW WELLS He did a cowardly thing ! DAVID HARKNESS ( laughs ) Only one ? ANDREW WELLS Is n't one enought ? DAVID HARKNESS I do two or three cowardly things  --  every day . ANDREW WELLS No you do n't , Dave . No decent man does .  --  Well - what can I do for you ? DAVID HARKNESS Mr. Wells , I 'd like to know if there is anything in this rumor that 's going around . ANDREW WELLS What rumor ? DAVID HARKNESS The rumor that you are to be a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVID HARKNESS Yes - to line you up for the Presidency later . ANDREW WELLS Good God !  --  Is that a rumor ? p. 5 DAVID HARKNESS Have n't you heard it ? ANDREW WELLS Not yet . DAVID HARKNESS You have n't been approached ? ANDREW WELLS Not yet . DAVID HARKNESS You know the rumor is around , do n't you ? ANDREW WELLS No , I do n't . DAVID HARKNESS ( surprised ) Is that true ? ANDREW WELLS I have never lied to you , have I , Dave ? DAVID HARKNESS ( laughs ) Not that I know of . ( then more serious , matching his tone from Wells ) No sir , I do n't think you ever have . ANDREW WELLS Where did you get this story , Dave , if you do n't mind telling me ? DAVID HARKNESS Not at all . It came in from our Washington Bureau tonight . ANDREW WELLS Tied up with anyone , or just cloakroom stuff ? DAVID HARKNESS The story is that Senator Colter is coming to see you tonight . ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad secretary . p. 6 DAVID HARKNESS He is n't coming ? ANDREW WELLS He is . DAVID HARKNESS Then there is a story ? ANDREW WELLS Senator Colter is one of my oldest friends , Dave ! The oldest here in the East . We were in high school together back in Kansas . DAVID HARKNESS I thought it was college . ANDREW WELLS College , too  --  same , class , same fraternity and all the rest of it . He is coming to see us tonight  --  and that is all there is to the story as far as I know it . DAVID HARKNESS Senator Colter is an astute policitian  --  and a power in his party . If he wants you for Governor now  --  and President later  --  ANDREW WELLS Reaching pretty high for this one  --  are n't you , Dave ? DAVID HARKNESS I do n't think so . From District Attorney of New York through Governor to President of the United States is a pretty straight road . ANDREW WELLS ( laughs ) Smith  --  Dewey  --  DAVID HARKNESS Roosevelt  --  both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course  --  but  --  well  --  if you 'll excuse me putting it this way  --  you 're a natural . p. 7 ANDREW WELLS ( laughs ) You mean I come from Kansas ? DAVID HARKNESS The Middle West  --  the East  --  and a flawless record ! You 're known as the greatest Prosecuting Attorney New York has ever had . The Royal Political Road , all right . Was Prosecuting Attorney Senator Colter 's idea in the first place ? ANDREW WELLS ( laughs ) No ! Boy , you fellows are suspicious . You 're worse than a prosecuting lawyer . DAVID HARKNESS Do you mind telling me why ? ANDREW WELLS ( a little irritably ) Why what ? DAVID HARKNESS Why you became a Prosecuting Attorney ? ANDREW WELLS ( crisply ) Because I hate criminals . DAVID HARKNESS ( laughs ) Look out ! Is n't that un-American ? ANDREW WELLS ( ignoring ) I 've never had any sympathy with criminals !  --  maybe because my father was a minister . The sense of right and wrong was hammered into me as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sons turn against all they hear from their fathers - especially ministers ' sons . p. 8 ANDREW WELLS I had it from my mother , too . ( laughs ) We had a young desperado in our town  --  he died  --  shooting it out with a posse . He was a hero to all the kids . His old mother always had a terrible fascination for me . I used to sneak over to her cabin whenever I could get the chance - she was a frightful old woman . Snuff and drink  --  and I had an awful sense of guilt when I would go over there , and yet I 'd go  --  bring in wood for her and bucket of water  --  to ease my conscience . And then my mother found out about it one day ! and did she tan me ! ( laughs ) Perhaps that was the start for me  --  and of my feeling about criminals ! DAVID HARKNESS How did you happen to come to New York in the first place  --  from a small town in Kansas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smart looking woman , in her late 40 's , capable , efficient , very New York , with - as so many good New Yorkers  --  no trace of her Middle West background . WELLS ( hesitating on seeing Harkness ) Oh , I thought you were alone , Drew . ANDREW WELLS This is David Harkness of the Herald Tribune , Margaret . ( His manner to his wife is one of great politeness , but it is the politeness that one gives to a stranger . Both he and Margaret go through all the gestures of being man and wife , but they are , in fact , separated  --  very far apart.There is an empty , puppet-like quality to everything they say to each other . ) MRS . WELLS ( nodding to Dave ) I 'm delighted to know you . ( To Wells ) I 'll come back , Drew . ( turns to go out ) p. 9 ANDREW WELLS Stay , Margaret . Dave wants to know what brought me to New York . You 're just the one to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Harkness ) My wife brought me . I would have been a small town lawyer in Kansas all my life if it had not been for her  --  ( hesitates ) prodding . Mrs. Wells has gone back to the door . WELLS I 'll come back later , Drew . ANDREW WELLS What is it , Margaret ? We have no secrets from the Press . ( he looks at her a little surprised ) You look  --  ( hesitates ) troubled ?  --  WELLS ( in the doorway ) It 's Fran . ANDREW WELLS What about Fran ? WELLS She 's getting up , Drew  --  going out . ANDREW WELLS Well ? WELLS You know how she 's been , Drew . ANDREW WELLS I know she 's had a cold for a long time , yes . WELLS She 's in bed . You did n't even notice that she did n't come to the dinner table ! ANDREW WELLS That 's nothing new  --  she hardly ever comes . p. 10 WELLS Generally she is n't home . ANDREW WELLS Not home  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say I blame her . WELLS Drew , this is serious . She should n't go out . ANDREW WELLS Where 's she going ? WELLS Oh , just out  --  around  --  with her friends . ANDREW WELLS That 's nothing new , either . WELLS ( desperately ) She 's sick , Drew . Yes , you force me to say it  --  much as I hate the word  --  sick  --  she 's running a temperature and  --  ANDREW WELLS ( concerned ) If she 's running a temperature , call a doctor . WELLS ( more desperately ) You know how I hate doctors , Drew . I 've been trying to get Nellie Broker long distance all evening to work for me , but  --  ANDREW WELLS ( crisply ) I 'll get a doctor . They say there 's a very good man right in the house here . ( he reaches for the phone ) ( in the phone ) ANDREW WELLS Hello . Is the doctor in his apartment , do you know ? ( pause ) Connect me , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Wait a minute , what 's his name ? All right , connect me. p. 11 WELLS ( relieved but still distressed ) I guess it 's best . I hate to do it but I 'm sure she has a temperature andnellie does n't answer . If I could get her , she 'd go to work for me right away , but  --  ANDREW WELLS That 's all right , Margaret . I 'll get the doctor now and you can call Mrs. Broker later , if you want to . ( he speaks in the phone ) Hello . Dr. Thomas ? This is Andrew Wells  --  in the building , yes . Oh , thank you . My daughter seems to be a little bit under the weather  --  I do n't know , but would it be asking too much for you to drop up and take a look at her ? Right away ? Thank you . ( he hangs up ) He 'll be right up . WELLS ( turning to go out the door ) Thank you , Drew . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to have met you , Mr. Harkness . ( She goes ) HARKNESS ( a little hesitant ) Mrs. Wells is a Christian Scientist ? ANDREW WELLS No , but  --  something along that line  --  something she got hold of back home just after Fran was born . A girl who was her most intimate friend in college married and did n't make a go of it - became some sort of a mental healer - and took my wife along with her - everything is spirit with them you know - no flesh . p. 12 DAVID HARKNESS No sickness ? No death ? ANDREW WELLS No evil . No evil of any kind . She did a surprising thing when she came in here to get me to get a doctor . DAVID HARKNESS She said she did n't want a doctor , only  --  ANDREW WELLS She wanted one , but she did n't want to send for him herself . ( a little bitterly ) That 's the way they work , Dave . It 's an evasion of reality right through . DAVID HARKNESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dave . I told you my father was a Methodist minister ! He was beating the drum against sin his whole life . DAVID HARKNESS That 's where you get your prosecuting genius . ( laughs - rises ) ANDREW WELLS Do n't go , Dave . DAVID HARKNESS But if your daughter 's ill  --  ANDREW WELLS Fran 's not ill - just a cold . She 's had it a long time and neglected it . You know how these girls are , Dave . Senseless - run around all night in the wet and ice in little satin slippers . If she would just stay at home one night ! No , she 's got to have continual excitement . p. 13 DAVID HARKNESS She 's an exciting girl . ANDREW WELLS ( surprised ) You know my daughter , Dave ? DAVID HARKNESS Unfortunately , no . I worship from afar . ANDREW WELLS I did n't think that would be in your line . DAVID HARKNESS It is n't . ANDREW WELLS How do you know she is an exciting girl , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANDREW WELLS ( quickly , suspiciously ) Around ? What do you mean , around ? DAVID HARKNESS ( uneasily ) Oh , where she goes . ANDREW WELLS ( in the same way ) Where 's that ? DAVID HARKNESS ( shrugs ) You know , the clubs - the smart clubs , the  --  ANDREW WELLS ( same way ) Nothing wrong about that , is there ? DAVID HARKNESS Wrong ? Of course not , who said anything about wrong ? ANDREW WELLS Those places are just high-toned saloons ! ( then in the same suspicious way ) It ought to be easy for you to get to know her , then , if she 's around , as you say . p. 14 DAVID HARKNESS ( still uneasily ) Oh , she 's always with her own little crowd . They troop around together . ANDREW WELLS Troup around ? Where ? DAVID HARKNESS Wherever they happen to want to go . You said it yourself - little slippers in the mud , and all that . ANDREW WELLS ( gives him a quick look ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Fran , Dave . You 'd be a good oeau for her . DAVID HARKNESS Beau ? What 's a beau ? ANDREW WELLS I do n't know  --  these days . ( then ) You 'd give her enough excitement , Dave , and a little balance with it  --  Maybe , in the end , settle her down . DAVID HARKNESS ( laughs ) No girl 's going to settle down with me . I do n't like em settled . NORVAL enters the center door , followed by WILLIAM COLTER . NORVAL Senator Colter . NORVAL goes.COLTER comes in.WILLIAM COLTER is a year or two older than Andrew Wells , les small , plain-looking man , smart , cheerful , able , a professional politician , a Senator . ANDREW WELLS Hell , Bill . p. 15 COLTER Hello , Andy . ANDREW WELLS You know Dave Harkness of the Herald Tribune ? COLTER ( nods to Harkness ) Got here ahead of me huh ? DAVID HARKNESS Have you any statement to make , Senator Colter , about Mr. Wells ' candidacy ? COLTER ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing his ground ) Governor of New York first  --  then  --  COLTER ( crisply ) Yes , go ahead  --  print it . ANDREW WELLS Wait a minute , Bill , nothing 's settled yet . COLTER There is n't anything that ca n't be settled . ANDREW WELLS That is n't sure . COLTER ( a little impatiently ) Let him go ahead and say you 've been approached , anyway . ANDREW WELLS But if  --  COLTER I like it from several angles . To tell you the truth , I was going to ring up the Times from the airport when I left tonight . p. 16 ANDREW WELLS I 'd rather nothing would be said  --  if it 's all the same to you , Bill  --  nothing at all till after we have our talk . You 'll hold off , wo n't you , Dave ? DAVID HARKNESS If you insist . ANDREW WELLS I know I can trust you . DAVID HARKNESS I 'll say you do . Did't I hold off on the Campos case till  --  ANDREW WELLS ( interrupting quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost lost my job ! COLTER What case wasthat ? DAVID HARKNESS ( smiling ) That was the famous case that Mr. Wells did not prosecute . ANDREW WELLS ( quickly ) I put Jose Campos in the pen , did n't I ? DAVID HARKNESS But not Wilma Campos . ANDREW WELLS ( concealed irritation ) There were circumstances . You know that , Dave . The girl was pregnant and  --  DAVID HARKNESS ( laughs ) And guilty . ANDREW WELLS ( quickly ) You think I did wrong ? p. 17 DAVID HARKNESS No , of course not . I think you did right , but  --  What time do you want to see me tomorrow to give me the story ? ANDREW WELLS Oh , about eleven . DAVID HARKNESS At the office , or here ? ANDREW WELLS At the office . I 'm never here , at late as eleven , you know that . I 'm at my desk every morning by ten . DAVID HARKNESS ( moving to the door ) At the office at eleven . ( nods to Colter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( grunts ) Harkness starts out . ANDREW WELLS On second thought , maybe you better come here , Dave . Maybe it would be better . Maybe I wo n't want the story to even get started , and down there the boys will jump on it . Come here , early . DAVID HARKNESS ( in the doorway ) A little before ten ? ANDREW WELLS Yeah  --  you can ride down with me . DAVID HARKNESS ( starts out - turns ) I hope your answer is going to be " yes " , Mr. Wells . Just the idea of it has given me a lift already . p. 18 ANDREW WELLS ( still disturbed by the reference to Wilma Campos ) What do you mean - lift ? DAVID HARKNESS I could begin to believe in something maybe because I could believe in you . Harkness goes . COLTER That 's a good boy . ( as Wells says nothing ) Make a good press secretary if he was a little older . ( as Wells still says nothing ) They sure get around  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREW WELLS He said it was a tip from the Washington Bureau . COLTER Well  --  that 's me  --  I guess . I 've been pretty full of it  --  and Bourbon  --  lately . ANDREW WELLS ( coming to life again ) Ah  --  that reminds me  --  ( rings a bell for Norval  --  then to Colter ) How 's everything going with our lawmakers down in Washington ? COLTER Same old rat race . Enter Norval ANDREW WELLS Bring some whiskey , Norval . NORVAL Some Scotch , sir ? COLTER No  --  Bourbon . Or Rye will be all right , if you have n't got  --  p. 19 NORVAL ( dignified ) Mr. Wells got everything , sir.He goes . COLTER ( laughs ) So you got everything , eh , Andy ? ANDREW WELLS According to Norval . COLTER According to a lot of people  --  you 've got it all . ( looks around the room ) This sure is a long way from Zanesville , Kansas . ( gets up  --  walks around ) ANDREW WELLS You have n't seen this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a knockout  --  who did it all ? ANDREW WELLS Oh Margaret wangled it . COLTER That girl can wangle anything ! ANDREW WELLS She sure gets what she wants . COLTER You owe a lot of your success to Margaret , Andy . ANDREW WELLS ( laughs ) So she tells me . COLTER ( crosses to window ) Boy  --  what a view ! There she lies  --  right under you  --  the greatest city in the world  --  in the greatest country  --  proud  --  powerful  --  p. 20 ANDREW WELLS And destroyable in an hour . ( as Colter turns quickly away ) Do n't like to look at it - eh ? page no . I-17 missing COLTER It 's not that  --  I just do n't like high windows . I always feel they are sucking me out  --  you never feel that ? ANDREW WELLS No . Norval on with tray etc.He sets it down . ANDREW WELLS Thank you , Norval . That 'll be all . ( crosses to tray ) Norval goes . COLTER You got such damn steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water pitcher ) Still plain ? COLTER Yep . ( watching Wells pour ) Margaret 's going to be a big help to us  --  you know that  --  and Fran , too . They t'all me she 's glamor girl No . I.  --  Is that straight ? ANDREW WELLS So they say  --  and I wish she was n't . COLTER Why not ? ANDREW WELLS Oh  --  I 'm against this glamor girl stuff . COLTER You 're not the right age for it , Andy . Neither young  --  nor old  --  enough . ( Wells hands glass to Colter ) ( Colter lifts his glass ) To the President of the United States . p. 21 ANDREW WELLS Going a little fast , are n't you , Bill ? COLTER Not any faster than you are . You 're a man of destiny , Andy . You do n't have to do a thing  --  just go along . ANDREW WELLS ( laughs ) You been taking a poll ? COLTER I 've been studying all the angles , Boy  --  all the trends  --  ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COLTER ( seriously ) This all is n't just the idea of a good friend , Andy . The best political minds of the party are all focused on you . ANDREW WELLS But I am nationally unknown , Bill ! COLTER Not alltogether . You 've had more build-up than you realize in this job . ANDREW WELLS Not politically . COLTER That 's just why we want you . The country 's fed up with all the old big names - the ones they made deities  --  now they call demons - They feel betrayed  --  disillusioned  --  lost in the wilderness - and they want a new leader to take them out of it  --  someone they feel they can trust  --  someone that has n't had any truck with the powers of darkness that now threaten them  --  You  --  and your record of dealing with crime  --  exactly personifies what they want . p. 22 ANDREW WELLS ( goes to the window - looks out ) COLTER You 've got everything we need , Andy . Everything we 've got to have . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , too , a man of the people  --  from the grass roots  --  and ANDREW WELLS ( turning back to him ) All these old political cliches , Bill ! They do n't get me . COLTER They get you elected , Andy . And do n't you ever forget it . ANDREW WELLS It 's all hooey to me . COLTER Maybe so , but you 're not hooey . You 're an extraordinary man , Andy . ANDREW WELLS And that 's hooey . COLTER ( ignoring ) You 're 100 per cent straight and you ca n't say that of many men . You 're sound , Andy . There is n't a soft spot in you . The boys can comb your career from beginnning to end with a fine-tooth comb , and they wo n't find a louse anywhere . I tell you , you 're a man of destiny , Andy . ANDREW WELLS ( turning abruptly ) Oh shut up , will you ! COLTER ( surprised ) What 's the matter with you ? Do n't you want to be President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying out ) Yes ! Yes ! Of course , if it were possible ! Good God ! but there 's something I 've got to talk over with you first . ( he comes back to the desk ) COLTER ( leaning back , whiskey glass in hand ) I 'm listening . ANDREW WELLS ( not sitting ) I do n't know how to begin . ( walks , turns ) Well , I 'll make it short .  --  You heard Dave Harkness here speak of the Campos case ? The girl I did not prosecute ? COLTER Yes . ANDREW WELLS Well , that 's it , Bill . COLTER What do you mean ? ANDREW WELLS That 's the louse you 're looking for . COLTER I 'm not looking for any louse where you 're concerned . ANDREW WELLS Well , there it is , anyway . ( half to himself ) It 's a funny thing , that boy bringing it up just now . Have you over noticed how things come together like that ? Sort of little conglomerations , you might call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy , about this woman ? Is she your girl ? p. 24 ANDREW WELLS I guess that 's what you 'd call her . COLTER Good God ! ANDREW WELLS Does it surprise you ? COLTER ( impatiently ) It does more than that . ANDREW WELLS You are n't as naive as that , are you Bill ? COLTER ( Impatiently ) Naive ? No , but  --  ( hesitates ) ANDREW WELLS But what ? COLTER ( hesitant ) It 's just  --  a man like you  --  with a wife like Margaret  --  ANDREW WELLS ( swiftly ) Keep out of that side of it , Bill . You do n't know anything about it . COLTER Sorry . I just mean  --  I always thought Margaret the cleverest woman I know . I thought she could keep any man out of trouble . ANDREW WELLS You talk cliches so much  --  you end by believing them . ( pause  --  then ) Well - there it is , Bill . Now you know . COLTER ( rallying ) What do I know ? Nothing ! Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man has a girl does n't amount to anything . p. 25 ANDREW WELLS ( wryly ) Not to the future President of the United States ? COLTER No ! Look at Harding ! Look at - why , even old Wilson ! Good God  --  this is n't going to stop us , Andy . Anyway  --  by the time the Presidency comes up this will be a dead , dead fish . ANDREW WELLS Dead fish are very smelly . ( pause - then ) What about now ? COLTER Now you 've got a girl . And now you 've got to get rid of her  --  that 's all . ANDREW WELLS Maybe I do n't want to get rid of her . No , maybe not to be the President of the United States . COLTER Are you crazy ? ANDREW WELLS I 'm in love with her , Bill . COLTER ( impatiently ) What do you mean  --  love ? ANDREW WELLS I mean just what I said . I do n't know whether I can give her up . COLTER What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When she first came into my office  --  that day the detectives first brought her in  --  a girl arrested for complicity in a hold-up and murder  --  the wife of a criminal and pregnant at that  --  shabby , poverty-atricken , her face distorted with tears  --  talk about glamor !  --  From that moment my whole life changed for me . Something came from that girl to me like  --  God , I do n't know what it was . I  --  p. 26 Enter Margaret WELLS ( in the doorway ) Hello , Bill . COLTER ( rising ) Hello , Margaret . WELLS I 'm sorry you could n't get in  --  in time for dinner . COLTER I 'm sorry too . WELLS Are you staying in town ? COLTER No , going back tonight . WELLS Oh , that 's not fair . ( to Wells , she has gotten through her social routing ) The doctor 's going now , Drew . ANDREW WELLS Came right up , huh ? WELLS He would like to talk to you . ANDREW WELLS You talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's rather important . WELLS But Drew , he says  --  ANDREW WELLS You can tell me what he says later . What 's the matter ? You always take over everything about Frances . She goes . COLTER Someone sick ? ANDREW WELLS No , just one of Fran 's colds. p. 27 COLTER Oh  --  ( pause ) Does Margaret know , Andy ? ANDREW WELLS ( quickly ) No . Of course not . COLTER I 'm glad you 'd had that much consideration . ANDREW WELLS Keep out of this , will you ? Margaret and me , I mean . You do n't know anything about it . I 'll just tell you this though , if Margaret did know , it would n't matter to her in the least . COLTER ( drily ) Then why did n't you tell her ? ANDREW WELLS ( intensely ) Because it 's  --  it 's mine !  --  Do you understand that ? COLTER ( quietly ) Yes I do . ANDREW WELLS ( rushing on ) It seems to me nothing in my whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ! All my life I 've been what others wanted me to be  --  my mother  --  my father  --  my wife  --  my college  --  my job  --  It 's only in bed with this girl that I have ever felt really myself  --  me ! That 's why I ca n't bear to give her up ! COLTER ( ignoring ) Who does know ? ANDREW WELLS Nobody . p. 28 COLTER You ca n't be as smart as that . ANDREW WELLS I am . COLTER Has n't she family  --  friends ? ANDREW WELLS Not here . She came to New York to get away from her family and friends . COLTER Why ? ANDREW WELLS Oh , her father had served time once  --  He tried a small time robbery during the depression  --  it was all in the past  --  but the stigma was there  --  and when her mother died - she came here to get away from it . COLTER ( drily ) And married a criminal ! ANDREW WELLS ( uneasily ) Yes . Yes , she did . COLTER Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been in the reformatory . He 's only a boy  --  he  --  COLTER Why did she marry a young hoodlum if  --  ANDREW WELLS I do n't know and I do n't think she does . She says she thought she could reform him . COLTER Is that why she started out with him ? Robbery and murder ? Did n't this reporter say ? p. 29 ANDREW WELLS She did n't start out with him . She kepthim straight quite a while . COLTER ( drily ) Quite a while , but then , what ? ANDREW WELLS Then they lost their jobs , and  --  COLTER What were their jobs ? ANDREW WELLS She was a wrapper . You know , wrapped packages in a wholesale garment house and he collected the stuff for the trucks . COLTER That how she got to know him ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . He 's a very good-looking kid  --  in a flashy kind of way . I do n't like the way he looks but most people , men and women , think he 's handsome . COLTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs and  --  ANDREW WELLS Yes , and she was pregnant and he talked her into stealing a car and helping him hold up a gas station so they could get away . COLTER Not a very interesting story , is it ? ANDREW WELLS No  --  just routine . COLTER Where is the pretty boy now ? ANDREW WELLS In jail  --  10 years . p. 30 COLTER Murder ? ANDREW WELLS Manslaughter . COLTER You went easy on him , huh ! ANDREW WELLS ( defensively ) There was n't a good case . The girl was the only witness . She was his wife and would n't talk . COLTER Quite a heroine in your mind , is n't she ? ANDREW WELLS No , but I  --  I respect her . COLTER ( bruskly ) Where do you keep her ? ANDREW WELLS I do n't keep her . COLTER Where does she live ? ANDREW WELLS She lives in a little basement apartment on the West side . COLTER And what does she live on ? ANDREW WELLS On the money she earns selling dresses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COLTER Is this basement where you visit her ? ANDREW WELLS Yes , it is . COLTER Separate door downstairs and all that ? ANDREW WELLS I 'm never seen , if that 's what you 're getting at . p. 31 COLTER What about her friends ? She must have friends . ANDREW WELLS Not here . COLTER What does she do night when you 're not around ? Listen to the radio ! ANDREW WELLS She goes to night school . COLTER Good God . ANDREW WELLS ( seriously ) No one knows about this thing , Bill  --  no one at all , but now , you . COLTER You 've sure been lucky  --  or careful . ANDREW WELLS Both  --  ( suddenly ) I do n't even phone her , except from a cigar store . COLTER What about the baby you talked about ? Where 's it ? ANDREW WELLS It did n't live . COLTER ( seriously ) Looks like you 've had all the breaks , Andy . It 's going to be easier than I thought . Enter MARGARET COLTER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WELLS ( smiling in her usual social way ) Can any woman ? p. 32 ANDREW WELLS That 's all hooey that a woman ca n't keep a secret . Women are the most secretive creatures in the world . All policemen know that . They 're much harder to break than men . COLTER ( drily ) All criminals are secretive . They 've got to be . WELLS What 's your secret , Bill ? You can trust me  --  even if I 'm not a criminal . COLTER My secret is  --  that if the breaks keep up  --  you are going to be the First Lady of the Land . WELLS What are you talking about ? COLTER Yep ! First the Governor 's Lady  --  then the First Lady . We start tonight . It 's in the bag . ANDREW WELLS What is ever in the bag ? WELLS Is this true , Drew ? COLTER True , Drew !

Jersey  --  or  --  JOE Then what ? WILMA Then somewhere else . JOE How ? I suppose you want me to steal a car . Yes ! You 're pushin ' me back  --  like Ma ! Down into crime again  --  Gooch was bringin ' me up ! He taught me a lot  --  He 's rich  --  made millions . p. 91 WILMA Is that what got him in jail ? JOE No  --  but it got him an easy life there  --  as easy as you can get it  --  privilege , that 's the word ! Money ! WILMA Is that how he got you out ? JOE Some  --  and the rest planning  --  planning like I 'm trying to do now  --  if you 'd let me ! ( as she turns radio off ) Keep that radio on - It helps me to think . WILMA ( almost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What with ? I got to manouver around to get us some money . WILMA I got some money ! JOE How much ? WILMA Enough to get us away . Plenty . JOE And then what ? How are we going to live ? We got to plan . I do n't want to go on like I did before  --  just following my life . I want to direct it  --  I used to think it all depends on the type of breaks you get  --  But Gooch taught me it 's possible to make your chance ! If you use your brains  --  Like I 'm going to do . I do n't want to waddle around in dirt all my life . If I work hard with my mind  --  I can make a lot of money.  --  WILMA Oh Joey ! Quit dreamin ' ! p. 92 JOE Sure I can ! But I 'm not interested in making a lot ! having a lot of cars  --  and all that  --  All I want is maybe a big wide belt  --  with a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilma turns off the radio ) What you doin ' ? For Christ sake ! WILMA Quit listenin ' to music ! Quit  --  JOE I 'm going to listen to music ! Turn it on ! WILMA Turn it on yourself ! JOE You bet I will . ( He gets up  --  goes to radio . He is already a little drunk . As he leaves table , she takes gun - slips it in the drawer there - under the table cover - before he turns. ) ( he turns the radio on - stands beside it dreamily ) Music is like a hot poker that singes your heart . That 's what Gooch used to say . How 's that ? Good  --  eh ? He said the same thing about me  --  almost  --  WILMA What ? JOE He said when I smiled it was like fire ran through his blood . WILMA He said that ! To you ! JOE Yeah ! Why not ! What you lookin ' like that for ? I Know , what you 're thinking ! You think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! Well , what if he is  --  that didnot hurt nothing . p. 93 WILMA ( low ) You always called em lice before ! Lice - you always said . JOE That was outside  --  inside  --  it 's different . Guys inside - they have n't got anything else  --  Sure they fall in love with another guy . WILMA Was he in love with you ? JOE ( angry ) What if he was ? That do n't say I was in love with him . No ! There was n't anything between us . No . The most is he 'd put his arms around my shoulder  --  and sometimes when we went to the motion pictures he 'd hold my hand . ( crying out ) I liked him ! Sure ! But I hate anything like you 're thinking . Yes , lots of times I 'd get little flashes of hate for him  --  WILMA Flashes of hate ? JOE Yes ! Like I get for you  --  WILMA Oh Joe ! You do n't hate me ! JOE Sometimes  --  little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a flash of hate for you  --  the same like I did for him  --  Like I could kill him ! WILMA Kill him ! Then you sure did n't love him . JOE ( crying out ) No ! I ai n't that kind ! I never was . If I was I 'd want to kill myself  --  I think too much of my repuation  --  as a convice  --  as a right guy . None of those guys in there can ever say that of me ! No ! Though a lot of em think it ! He ai n't the first that 's come up and put his arm around me  --  all my life guys have been after me . But I 'm not that kind , no ! I wo n't be- I wo n't ! That I killed that watchman , that do n't bother me none - I never think of it  --  But if I turned int 8n/8f those  --  God ! I 'd never get over that ! That 's my pride ! That I live by ! That I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reformatory that time , there was four little nigger fairies in there and all the guys was sneakin ' in - sleeping with em . But not me ! No , not me ! I would n't ! I would n't give in , not me ! p. 94 WILMA ( slowly ) What does he look like , Joe ? JOE Who ? Gooch ? WILMA Yes . JOE Oh , he 's short and well built  --  with broad shoulders  --  only the muscles in his arms are soft  --  like yours ! - and he 's got wrinkles around his eyes - like Ma . WILMA ( low ) There was something between you , Joe ! JOE ( crying out ) And what if there was ? What if I did ! It was to get out ! To you ! That 's all ! Not because I wanted to ! Not because I 'm like that  --  No , no , I 'm not  --  ( pleading ) That 's why you get to sleep with me now , will - it will tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right again  --  I can take em all on  --  anything that comes  --  ( going toward her ) You got to , Will ! - You ca n't let me down now ! I was supposed to go right where he told me to go - instead , I come to you . I 'm never going to him again  --  never  --  I just used him to get out  --  That 's all - that 's the only reason  --  to you  --  WELLS comes on at hall door - up left . WILMA and JOE are down right - by the bed . Wilma is the first to see Wells . She breaks away from Joe - Joe turns - sees Wells - springs toward table for his gun . It is gone . p. 95 JOE ( desperately ) My gun ! Where 's my gun ? Wilma ! ANDREW WELLS ( coming down - his hand in his coat pocket ) Sit down , Joe . JOE ( stares at him - then speaks - shocked , confused and a little incoherent ) Oh  --  You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a chair ) You can put that gun up  --  I wo n't make no trouble for you - the best man wins . ( sits ) Wilma ( going to him ) Joey ! JOE Nothing - everything just went black all of a sudden ! First I was seeing everything through red  --  then it all blacked out and I could n't see nothing ' - Give me a drink , Will . WILMA That 's what made you dizzy , Joe . JOE I was n't dizzy - I just could n't see - give me a drink.Wells nods to her - she starts to pour Joe a drink.How did you know where to find me , Mr. Wells ? My mother tell you ? ANDREW WELLS No . JOE I suppose you knew where Wilma was - keeping her checked , I suppose . Well - pretty fast work  --  all right . I did n't suppose they 'd find me gone  --  till morning check time  --  ( Wilma hands him a drink , he looks at it ) Will you have one , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , Mr. Wells , and that 's sayin ' a lot . Have one ! p. 96 ANDREW WELLS No , thank you , Joe . JOE ( drinks ) Here 's to you - best man wins ! ( puts glass down ) Well , shall we get goin ' ? ( gets up - starts toward door , turns ) What does this mean for me , Mr. Wells ? More time , I suppose  --  lost all my good time  --  twenty years now anyway , I suppose  --  well , O. K. ( suddenly springs on Wells - trips him and is beating him with his fists ) Wilma ( taking gun from table drawer ) Joe ! Let him go ! Let him go ! JOE ( turns on her ) What you doin ' ? Gim me that gun ! ( goes toward her ) WILMA Joe - I 'll shoot ! JOE You double crossin ' - ( snatches gun from her - turns toward Wells , who is on his feet - coming toward him ) Wilma ( in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way ! WILMA Joey  --  do n't  --  he 'll let us go  --  he 'll give us a chance  --  JOE How do you know ? WILMA Wo n't you , Mr. Wells ? You 'll give us a chance  --  you 'll  --  p. 97 JOE How do you know so much ? Has he been messin ' around you ? By God , he has ! That 's why he came here ! With a key ! Yes ! He came in with a key . So that 's why you 're  --  different ? Yeah , yeah  --  and I thought it was me ! That 's why you were so good to me up there - messin ' around with my wife  --  I thought you were a little tin Jesus  --  the both of you  --  Jesus and Mary ! Playin ' me for a sucker all these months  --  the both of yuh ! Well - I 'll show you who 's a sucker ! and who 's a man ! Sit there on the bed  --  the both a you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow - both a yuh ! on the bed ! ( shoots from door - Wells ducks down , the bed between him and Joe . Wilma rises , starts toward Joe - falls - Joe bolts out the door ) ( Wells gets up - goes to Wilma ) ANDREW WELLS Wilma ! You hurt ! WILMA ( low ) He did n't mean to do it - it was just a flash . ANDREW WELLS ( turns to phone ) I 'll get a doctor . WILMA ( crying out ) No - not here . You must get out of here ! Go ! Go now ! I do n't want to die in vain . ANDREW WELLS The doctor will save you ! WILMA ( muttering ) All in vain !  --  like I lived  --  all a dream  --  It 's all going by me  --  like a dream  --  all the people I loved going by - my father  --  Joey  --  the baby  --  you  --  all a dream  --  none of it real . ( crying out ) Everything 's getting dark ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to her ) Do n't be afraid , dear  --  WILMA I 'm not afraid  --  for the first time in my life  --  Not afraid  --  It 's like I 'm floating  --  floating away on something light and airy  --  like angels ' wings . ANDREW WELLS It is that , dear . WILMA But it is not like in the air  --  it 's like I 'm in water  --  soft , warm water  --  under me  --  I 'm sinking into it  --  ( crying out ) Take me up ! Take me up off the floor ! ANDREW WELLS You should n't be moved , dear . WILMA Yes ! Up ! Off the floor ! I do n't want to die down here in the dirt ! Up ! Up ! There is a quick knock on the door.Then a knob is tried . She lifts her hand . WILMA Who is it ? MAN ( off ) Has anything happened ? WILMA No . MAN ( off ) I was upstairs  --  thought I heard shots  --  WILMA Nothing ! MAN ( Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excuse me  --  I thought maybe you needed help . p. 99 WILMA No help . MAN ( off ) Your voice sounds kind a funny  --  WILMA I 'm just going to sleep  --  MAN ( off ) O. K.  --  Good night . WILMA Good night . ( she dies ) The shadow of the man goes dimly by the window . ANDREW WELLS ( goes to her ) Wilma ! Wilma ! ( she does n't answer ) ( he kneels beside her ) @x Scene the same as Act I. The next morning a little after nine o'clock . The room is in the perfect order of a room which servants have cleaned and arranged and which no one has yet used . No sign of disarrangement anywhere . The curtains are drawn back precisely from the long windows and sun comes in here . The door to the main hall is closed . The door is opened . NORVAL steps in , followed by Senator Colter who carries two morning papers under his arm . COLTER comes into the room , NORVAL remains at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Sir . COLTER Thank you . Norval goes off , leaving the door open.The Senator looks around the room a little uneasily , goes to the window , looks out , lights a cigarette , then goes to an easy chair , sits and is about to read one of his papers when MRS . WELLS comes on . She wears good-looking street clothes and looks not only fashionable but crisp , brisk and efficient . This is her mood throughout the first scenes . She carries a little notebook in her hand . WELLS ( coming in ) Drew will be here in just a few minutes , Bill . COLTER ( who has risen as she comes in the door ) How is he this morning ? p. 101 WELLS Oh  --  all right , I guess . To tell you the truth , he has not appeared yet . He did n't expect you , did he ? COLTER No . But I heard him tell that reporter to be here before ten , so I thought I 'd get in ahead of him . WELLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points I want to get over first , too . ( tosses her note book on the desk - takes a cigarette ) He wo n't be long . I 've heard him moving around in his room for a long while . This plan of yours has quite bowled him over , Bill . I 've never seen him react to anything like this . He 's really excited . As soon as you left he went out to walk it off . And I heard him walking up and down in his room again when I was getting up this morning . COLTER ( uneasily ) That 's no good ! He ought to get his rest . WELLS ( easily ) Oh , he 's all right . He does n't need much sleep . He usually reads most of the night anyway . COLTER Has he had any breakfast ? WELLS No  --  He told Norval he did n't want any . Just a cup of coffee  --  I think he 's having a little trouble preparing his statement for the press . He sent out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tabloids and everything . Nothing has leaked out yet , so we can break the story just as we want . ( laughs ) They are all taken up with this new murder . p. 102 COLTER They know where circulation is . WELLS I see even you are reading it . COLTER Are n't you ? WELLS Every word . COLTER You see ! WELLS Oh - I 'm just interested in it because of Drew . It was his case  --  he prosecuted the boy for the first killing . And somehow - I do n't know  --  it was cut and dried murder , but Drew did not seem to want to see it through  --  send the boy to the chair , I mean  --  It must have been against his own judgment , because I know he believes that there are such things as born criminals , and it is a danger to society to be sentimental about them . He will be awfully interested in the way this has worked out , sort of " I told you so "  --  unless it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drew is if something gets on his conscience . COLTER What time did Andy get in last night , do you know ? WELLS No - I usually stay awake till Fran gets home  --  but last night  --  COLTER How is Fran ? WELLS ( firmly ) She is going to be all right . COLTER Doctor got her in hand ? p. 103 WELLS ( seriously ) God has her in hand , Bill . I got Nelly Broker finally on the phone last night . She went right to work for me ! COLTER Who 's Nelly Broker ? WELLS You know ! Nelly Evans ! In college with us ! My roommate ! COLTER Oh yes  --  married Tom Broker - I remember . Left him  --  the next day  --  did n't she ? WELLS ( seriously ) She 's become a great spiritual healer , Bill . I always call her when - WELLS comes on from the center door . He looks a different man , thinner , older . He carries several pages of written paper in his hand . He crosses directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Good morning , Margaret . Hello , Bill . WELLS Good morning , Drew . COLTER Hello , fellow . ANDREW WELLS I did n't expect you here , Bill . Glad to see you . Nice of you to come . WELLS Drew , is anything the matter ? ANDREW WELLS What ? WELLS ( hesitantly ) You look  --  almost  --  I do n't know  --  p. 104 ANDREW WELLS What ? WELLS ( more alarmed ) As though  --  you had had a  --  shock  --  or  --  ANDREW WELLS ( quickly ) I 'm all right , Margaret . WELLS Of course  --  I know you are  --  but  --  ( then going on quickly , nodding towards the papers he has brought in his hand ) I see you have prepared your statement for the press . ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS May I have a look at it ? ANDREW WELLS Later , Margaret . WELLS I would like to see it before you give it out . ANDREW WELLS Not now , Margaret . WELLS ( a little impatiently ) Why not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bill about first , now he is here . WELLS ( to Colter ) You see how he excludes me , Bill ? ANDREW WELLS I exclude you ? WELLS Always , if you can . p. 105 ANDREW WELLS I thought it was the other way around . COLTER ( always conciliatory ) You better let her see it , Andy . She is a better politician than I am . ANDREW WELLS I want her to see it ! She must see it ! - but later . WELLS ( insistently ) Before you give it out , Drew ! ANDREW WELLS Yes , Margaret . WELLS All right , have your talk . ( goes to the door - turning to Colter ) You are staying for lunch , are n't you , Bill ? COLTER It 's not sure , Margaret , I ought to get back before  --  WELLS There will be a place for you . ( starts out , turns back ) Drew . ANDREW WELLS Yes ? WELLS Is it this murder that has upset you ? ANDREW WELLS Upset me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes you say that ? WELLS Because you were rude to me. p. 106 ANDREW WELLS I 'm sorry . WELLS That you 've never been ! ( turns to Colter ) All these years , and we have never been rude to each other . COLTER That 's too bad , you have missed a lot . WELLS ( to Wells ) Have we , Drew ? Have we missed a lot ? ANDREW WELLS I ca n't discuss that point now , Margaret . WELLS ( to Colter ) You see how he excludes me ? ( suddenly --  helplessly to Wells ) There is something wrong , Drew  --  terribly wrong  --  I know it  --  I feel it , and you wo n't tell me  --  you wo n't  --  ANDREW WELLS ( gently ) Later , Margaret , it wo n't be long . WELLS It is this murder ! ANDREW WELLS Margaret  --  please  --  WELLS Drew , there is nothing for you to be upset about . It just bears out your own conviction about criminals that  --  ANDREW WELLS Will you leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ddeply hurt ) Why , of course , if you wish . I was just going . ( she goes ) p. 107 ANDREW WELLS Poor girl . ( There is a pause . He nods at the newspaper Colter still has in his hand . ) Well , I see , you know  --  COLTER Yes . ( hesitates - then ) As Margaret would put it : God seems to be on our side . ANDREW WELLS What do you mean by a thing like that ? COLTER Well , you are out , are n't you ? ANDREW WELLS ( more outraged ) Out ? How do you mean out ? COLTER ( hesitantly ) Well  --  the girl 's  --  gone , Andy . ANDREW WELLS Yes  --  she is gone . COLTER I know it is a shock to you - but ca n't we take this thing  --  if we believe in our destiny  --  as an intervention of fate ? ANDREW WELLS Pretty big words you are spouting , Bill . COLTER It 's a pretty big destiny . ANDREW WELLS You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girl is gone , Andy , and nothing connects you with her in any way . ANDREW WELLS No ? p. 108 COLTER ( firmly ) No , nothing . ANDREW WELLS ( swiftly ) Why did he kill her then , if you know so much ? COLTER Because she refused to go away with him . ANDREW WELLS Yes ? COLTER Yes ! The old mother makes a complete case . She says she pleaded with the girl to keep him for just one night anyway  --  be good to him , as she puts it  --  and the girl refused . ANDREW WELLS ( nods ) Yes . COLTER She also says there was no man in it , she is sure of it , no man at all . That 's what I mean when I say : God is on our side , Andy . ANDREW WELLS ( angrily ) Why do you always have to think he is on your side ? God can be vengeful , do n't forget that ! ( suddenly ) I 'm resigning my job as prosecutor today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy . You can make the campaign without resigning . Look at  --  Dewey , look at  --  ANDREW WELLS Campaign ? You think I am going ahead with this thing now ? p. 109 COLTER I know you are . ANDREW WELLS No . No . COLTER I know this has hit you hard ! Of course ! But listen to me , Andy  --  it will all soon die down and  --  ANDREW WELLS I loved the girl ! Do n't you know anything about that ? No  --  you do n't ! COLTER ( losing patience ) God - every man that 's ever been in love thinks he 's the only one that  --  ever  --  ANDREW WELLS ( interrupting ) If there was n't anything more to it than that ! Bill , she was murdered ! And you think I can now enter a political campaign for Governor of the State ? You sound crazy  --  indecent ! COLTER ( soothing ) Andy ! Listen to me , will you ? ANDREW WELLS Do n't talk , Bill ! I know what I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course  --  give up any idea of the nomination for Governor  --  second  --  resign as Prosecutor  --  third  --  make a clean breast to Margaret . ( rings the bell ) That should probably come first . COLTER You are going to tell Margaret about this thing ? p. 110 ANDREW WELLS Yes . COLTER Now ? When it is over ? ANDREW WELLS Over ? It will never be over ! COLTER No ! Not if you are going to give the rest of your life up to memory and regret . ANDREW WELLS Regret ! God ! Norval comes on at the door . NORVAL You rang , sir ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . Will you ask Mrs. Wells to come here , please ? NORVAL Yes , sir . ( turns to go ) ANDREW WELLS Now . NORVAL ( he goes ) Yes , Sir . COLTER Listen , Andy . Today  --  now  --  in an hour so tired , exhausted  --  you are preparing not only to destroy your career , but your life . If you tell Margaret this thing , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREW WELLS I have n't any life with her . COLTER She is your wife . ANDREW WELLS Yes . COLTER Then , at least you must consider her . p. 111 ANDREW WELLS As far as I can , I am going to . COLTER Andy , listen to me ! You do n't know what you are doing . You are preparing not only to destroy a fine and honorable public life , but also your private life . All I 'm asking you to do is : Wait  --  just a couple of days  --  one  --  ANDREW WELLS I ca n't wait , Bill , I 've got to act , and now . COLTER But why ? ANDREW WELLS Because the boy killed her  --  because of me ! I was there ! I went there last night to break with her , and then  --  just then  --  ( Stops - unable to go on ) COLTER ( slowly ) Did he see you there ? ANDREW WELLS That is why he killed her  --  I tell you ! COLTER Oh . ( pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREW WELLS Everything  --  yes . COLTER Good God .  --  This is bad , Andy . ANDREW WELLS Bad ? It 's ruin ! I feel my whole life crashed around me  --  just rubble and dirt ! ( turns to the window again ) Funny how we were talking just last night of a bomb destroying the city . I feel as though it had happened  --  and I was part of it . I feel myself down there now  --  crushed under a mountain mass  --  as though what has happened to me is just part of some colossal disaster  --  of everything  --  of  --  p. 112 COLTER This is no time for fantasy , Andy . ANDREW WELLS Fantasy ? Nightmare ! A nightmare that has become a reality  --  a monstrous crazy reality that I ca n't do anything about  --  that  --  Norval on . NORVAL ( at the door ) Mrs. Wells will be right in , Sir . ANDREW WELLS Thank you , Norval . NORVAL She just stopped to speak with that reporter , Sir . ANDREW WELLS ( quickly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . ANDREW WELLS ( terribly disturbed ) Oh  --  very good , Norval  --  very good . Norval goes . ANDREW WELLS Well - it 's begun . That 's the first of the pack after me . They must have picked Jose up . COLTER No , Andy , No ! It 's the boy who was here last night . ANDREW WELLS What boy ? COLTER That fellow you told to come here this morning ! for your statement ! ANDREW WELLS God - I am losing my , grip ! p. 113 COLTER ( goes to him - puts his hand on his shoulder ) Andy ! ( hesitates - a little embarrassed ) You know I really care about you , do n't you ? ANDREW WELLS ( muffled ) Yes , I think you do . COLTER We have held to each other most of our lives  --  and have asked very little of each other  --  but now I am asking something of you  --  and I think you owe it to me . It 's very little . ANDREW WELLS Well ? COLTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  today ! ANDREW WELLS And do what ? COLTER Do nothing . ( as Wells makes an impatient gesture ) I learned this from my father , Andy  --  a successful man , you know that . When things got tough  --  and they do , at times , in everyman 's life  --  my father would just disappear  --  get himself a hotel room under another name and stay in there where nothing and nobody could get at him , till the situation had cleared itself up . ANDREW WELLS ( his strength coming back ) Well - my father handled his life differently - and he was also a success . He faced up to his life  --  to his convictions  --  every minute . He really believed in a God and tried to live by his judgment . I know what he would tell me to do now  --  what I have to do . p. 114 COLTER What ? ANDREW WELLS Face it through ! Stay here ! and  --  COLTER All right ! Stay here ! But let me handle it ! ANDREW WELLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as I do  --  that there is n't anything that depends on human beings that ca n't be - fixed . ANDREW WELLS So now - I 'm to become a fixer . COLTER No - I am . ANDREW WELLS And I just sit by and  --  COLTER And trust me - yes ! ANDREW WELLS ( touched ) You ca n't do it , Bill ! Even if I would let you . The facts are too  --  COLTER You can fix facts ! There are no facts ! ANDREW WELLS God , you sound just like Margaret ! - she thinks you can fight evil by - COLTER Evil ? Bad luck that 's all . ANDREW WELLS Bill , I put this boy in the pen . I took his wife . I was in her room when  --  WELLS on . WELLS That nice reporter is here , Drew - for your statement . p. 115 ANDREW WELLS Yes . Norval just told me . WELLS I asked him to wait a bit  --  that there were a few points you wanted to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is he in the living room ? ( gets up to close the door ) WELLS He 's in the hall at the moment  --  talking to his office . He is keeping in touch with them about the Campos murder story . As soon as he leaves you , he is taking that over . ( laughs ) You can be very flattered , Drew  --  that you come first . page no . III-15 missing ANDREW WELLS ( coming back to his desk ) There is something I have to tell you , Margaret ( rings bell for Norval ) I 'd like Fran to hear it , too . ( Margaret ) ( surprised ) Fran ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . If she is well enough . WELLS Oh she 's all right ! ( then ) They 've found how the boy got out , Drew ! ANDREW WELLS How ? WELLS OH --  an exprisoner who was in love with him --  ANDREW WELLS ( surprised ) In love ? p. 116 Norval on NORVAL ( in the doorway ) Yes , sir ? ANDREW WELLS Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . ANDREW WELLS Immediately . NORVAL Yes , sir . He goes WELLS What is it , Drew ? You sound so ominous ! COLTER Margaret ! Andy 's preparing to throw his life away -- now -- in one throw ! WELLS You mean he is not going to run ? COLTER If it were only that ! He 's made up his mind to destroy himself completely ! He wo n't listen to reason  --  he wo n't listen to me-only you can save him , Margaret  --  you 're a fighter ! You do n't quit when things get tough ! You fight ! You  --  ANDREW WELLS I thought your advice to me was to do nothing ! COLTER It is ! That 's one way of fighting ! sit tight ! And it takes more guts sometimes than getting in and slugging ! hitting out wild  --  the way you want to ! Norval on at door NORVAL Pardon me , Mr. Wells . p. 117 ANDREW WELLS Yes ? NORVAL Miss Frances is not in her room , sir . ANDREW WELLS Where is she ? Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't come home , sir . ANDREW WELLS ( after a pause ) Thank you , Norval . NORVAL Is that all , sir ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . ( Norval goes ) ANDREW WELLS Did you know this , Margaret ? WELLS No - I was n't in her room this morning . I was so busy with your statement - I - ANDREW WELLS And last night ? Perhaps she came home and went out early this morning . WELLS I do n't know , Drew . I was asleep . When I finally got Nelly I knew she was going to be all right and I  --  ANDREW WELLS Looks like it ! WELLS ( hears a sound in hall ) There she is now ! You see ! I told you  - -  Wells ( crossing swifly to door ) Frances ! FRANCES WELLS ( off ) Yes , father ? p. 118 ANDREW WELLS Come in here . FRANCES WELLS I 'm going to my room , father . ANDREW WELLS Come in here ! Now ! Please ! ( Frances on ) FRANCES WELLS Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WELLS Good morning , father . ( she looks uneasily around the room - avoiding her mother ) ANDREW WELLS Is n't this a rather extraordinary time for you to be coming home ? FRANCES WELLS Perhaps . ANDREW WELLS Where were you ? FRANCES WELLS I was with a friend . ANDREW WELLS Do you often stay away like this without letting your mother know ? FRANCES WELLS No - this was the first time . May I go to my room now , father ? ANDREW WELLS No - sit down , please . FRANCES WELLS But I want to go to my room ! Now you 've seen me . ANDREW WELLS You will go to your room later . I have something to tell you now . p. 119 FRANCES WELLS Wo n't it wait ? ANDREW WELLS No . WELLS It 's about your father 's plans , dear , about the campaign  --  we 're all going to help in that , you know . We want to talk it over while Bill is here . ANDREW WELLS Will you sit here , Margaret ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! FRANCES WELLS ( resentful ) What are you doing to us , father ? Trying out your first speech ? ANDREW WELLS No . FRANCES WELLS ( flippant ) It 's not a campaign speech , mother - it 's an address to the jury ! WELLS ( now uneasy ) Be still , Fran , your father has something to tell us  --  something important  --  COLTER ( goes toward door ) WELLS Do n't go , Bill - you 're in on this  --  we need you . COLTER I 'll be right here - right here in the living room , if you want me . WELLS But why are you going ? COLTER I 'm going to stall this reporter along . ( starts out , turns back ) Margaret ! Andy 's gone haywire ! Do n't you ! We 've both got to be wiser than he is today . p. 120 WELLS How , Bill ? What do you mean ? COLTER Well , you know that when things are tough  --  that is the time to do nothing  --  to pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be - squared ! ( he goes ) WELLS Well - Drew ? ANDREW WELLS ( pause  --  then ) You 've both read the morning papers  --  I take it . WELLS To be honest - I have only read the murder . ANDREW WELLS That 's what I want to talk to you about . WELLS Oh Drew ! Is this what you 're troubled about ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS But why ? ANDREW WELLS I am the reason the girl was killed . WELLS Oh , Drew , that 's just ridiculous ! because you did n't send him to the chair ?  --  why you acted for the best  --  you have nothing to blame yourself about ! This is going haywire ! ANDREW WELLS The girl was my mistress , Margaret ! WELLS Your mistress ? ANDREW WELLS I guess that 's the word . ( pause ) Well , have you nothing to say ? p. 121 WELLS No ! ANDREW WELLS Why not ? WELLS Because I do n't believe it ! I ca n't ! A girl like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Drew ? ANDREW WELLS I loved her . WELLS But was n't she terribly common , just a  --  ANDREW WELLS No . Very uncommon . WELLS But so removed from you  --  and everything you stand for  --  How could it  --  could it start ? ANDREW WELLS I ca n't explain it to you , Margaret  --  You just have to accept it  --  as a fact . WELLS Was n't she very young ?  --  hardly more than a child ? ANDREW WELLS Yes - not much older than Frances . WELLS Oh Drew ! ANDREW WELLS She sort of took the place of both of you in my life , I guess . WELLS ( crying out ) Do n't say a terrible thing to us like that ! ANDREW WELLS I did n't mean it that way . I do n't want to say anything terrible to you . God knows ! the facts are terrible enough . p. 122 WELLS Well , tell us them , then . We have to hear them . FRANCES WELLS ( gets up , crosses to another chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing , I 'm just cold . WELLS Had n't you better go to your room ? Your father will let you go now ! FRANCES WELLS No , I 'll sit here by the fire . ( She sits by the open fire in an armchair , withdrawn from the scene , her back to the audience . ) WELLS Go on , Drew . ANDREW WELLS I went to see her last night and  --  WELLS ( quickly ) Is that were you were going when I was trying to phone Nelly ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS And she told me everything was going to be  --  ( stops  --  then ) You had learned the boy had gotten out  --  and went to warn her  --  is that it ? ANDREW WELLS No . I went for quite another reason  --  WELLS What ? ANDREW WELLS To break off my relation with her . p. 123 WELLS ( quickly ) And you did ? ANDREW WELLS Yes , I did . WELLS Well then !  --  it 's over ! and everything is all right ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Drew ? ANDREW WELLS No . Please , sit down , Margaret . There is more  --  and everything is not all right . ( She sits down , waits , he does not go on ) WELLS You mean others know about this  --  this relation , and now  --  ANDREW WELLS ( absorbed ) Only Bill , I just told him . WELLS ( eagerly ) We can count on him . If Bill is the only one who knows , why , everything is all right then , it is all right ! ANDREW WELLS I was there , Margaret ! WELLS ( uneasily ) You mean you were there when the boy came ? You had not gone ? ANDREW WELLS Yes , I was there . WELLS But the papers say that no one  --  ANDREW WELLS I saw her killed ! WELLS But you said no one knew ! p. 124 ANDREW WELLS I told you I was the reason she was killed . I told you  --  WELLS But that did n't say you were there ! I just thought you meant  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw me there . And killed her because of me . And when he is  --  caught  --  he will  --  WELLS Maybe they wo n't find him ! ANDREW WELLS They will find him . It 's only a matter of hours . WELLS Then everybody will know  --  ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS ( pause - then ) What are you going to do ? ANDREW WELLS I 've done the first thing - you ! WELLS ( impatiently ) I mean publicly  --  what are you going to do publicly ? ANDREW WELLS I 'm giving a statement of the facts to the papers  --  now  --  WELLS Now ! ANDREW WELLS Yes . ( he picks up the written papers he brought into the room ) WELLS You mean to this reporter ? Here ? p. 125 ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS But that is n't the statement he came for , Drew ! It was the statement about the Governorship ! It was  --  ( stops - overcome ) ( gently ) Wells I know what this must do to you , Margaret , and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ! No ! ( sudden ) And then , what ? What are you going to do then ? ANDREW WELLS Then I 'm resigning my position as prosecutor and then  --  ( stops ) Margaret ( more bitter ) Yes , then ?  --  What 's going to happen to you then ? ANDREW WELLS I do n't know  --  And I do n't care . WELLS Well , I care . What of me in all this , what am I going to do ? ANDREW WELLS I do n't know , Margaret . Everyone faces disaster differently . WELLS Have you thought about it ? ANDREW WELLS Thought about it ! Good God ! Of course I 've thought about it . WELLS Well ? ANDREW WELLS It is something you 'll have to decide for yourself , as you have always decided everything . p. 126 WELLS You pull the foundations from under my life  --  and then you  --  ANDREW WELLS ( desperate ) What else can I do , Margaret ? Tell me that . The facts are  --  WELLS Deny them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh Margaret ! - you ca n't wipe out evil by denying it !  --  the boy saw me ! WELLS It 's your word against a criminal 's . The old woman said there was no one . You 've only to say  --  ANDREW WELLS Margaret ! I ca n't lie now ! On top of everything . WELLS If you ca n't deny it aggressively - you can passively . ANDREW WELLS And what do you mean by that rigamarole ? WELLS What Bill said - do nothing . Let the storm rage around you for a few days  --  it will pass over --  You 're irreproachable , Drew ! It will all go over  --  as a delusion of the boy 's mind - a - COLTER on . COLTER ( at the door ) Andy  --  Harkness was just talking to his paper . ANDREW WELLS Yes ? p. 127 COLTER They 've found Jose Campos - ANDREW WELLS Yes ? Where ? COLTER Lying in the mud at the bottom of the East River . WELLS ( quickly ) Dead ? COLTER Yes . WELLS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ) So that was his solution ! COLTER And a damned good one ! for everybody !  --  the police boat has been dragging the place all morning  --  they just now got him . ANDREW WELLS What put them there ? COLTER A woman in an apartment window last night  --  saw him sitting on the guard rail  --  and then  --  slip in . ANDREW WELLS How did she know it was he ? COLTER She did n't , the police took a chance . Something the old woman said about the boy liking to sit there when he was a kid . ANDREW WELLS ( to himself ) He must have gone there  --  right after . COLTER God is on our side , Andy . p. 128 WELLS Yes ! Yes ! ANDREW WELLS Do n't keep saying that ! It 's blasphemous ! WELLS But you 're saved , Drew ! ANDREW WELLS Saved ? WELLS Yes . You do n't have to resign . You do n't have to  --  COLTER You can go ahead with the campaign . WELLS You can go straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANDREW WELLS But something has happened ! WELLS Nothing that anyone knows - except we here . COLTER And you can trust us to keep our mouths shut  --  no one 'll ever know from us . ANDREW WELLS But I 'll know . I 'll always know ! I was in it . And it was in me . I 'll always feel soiled  --  besmirched  --  unclean ! until I  --  COLTER It was a mess , Andy  --  of course . But  --  ANDREW WELLS How am I to get clean of it ? Tell me that . I 've got to get clean . COLTER It will clean itself up in you , Andy , with time . Time washes everything . Time and work will  --  p. 129 ANDREW WELLS Work ? Do you really think I can go on with my work - now ? Prosecuting criminals - when I am one myself ? WELLS A criminal ! What do you mean by saying a ridiculous thing like that ? ANDREW WELLS Because I betrayed everything I stand for - everything and everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a girl ? ANDREW WELLS No ! Because I did n't stand by her ! Because I cast her off ! Because I was a coward . Because  --  COLTER You were just giving up the smaller for the greater . We all have to make that choice every day . ANDREW WELLS She died because of my cowardice . COLTER She died because her husband was a murderer . ANDREW WELLS I let him kill her ! WELLS You mean because you let him live ? Because  --  ANDREW WELLS No . Because I let it happen . There , before my eyes ! COLTER What else could you do ? He had a gun . ANDREW WELLS Yes . He had a gun . And when he lifted it - to kill - she ran toward it - to save me !  --  and I  --  ran away ! She died because of my cowardice , I tell you ! my criminal cowardice . That 's why I have to face up to it now , to prove to myself  --  at least now  --  at last  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without loyalty  --  without guts ! That is why I have to make a clean breast of it now  --  to the world and  --  p. 130 COLTER Now ? When  --  ANDREW WELLS Yes . Now ! To the world  --  and to myself . COLTER You 're crazy , Andy . ANDREW WELLS Maybe I am crazy . I think I am . That 's why I have to give my soul peace again  --  wash my soul clean again !  --  and  --  COLTER Ah - That 's that old preacher father of yours talking now , Andy . ( to Margaret ) You talk him into reason , Margaret ! You and Fran ! I can't. ( he goes ) ANDREW WELLS Yes . It is my old preacher father ! He 's in me - part of me - no matter how much I have betrayed him  --  It 's from him I get the strength now  --  to do what I have to do  --  ( he picks up the written papers - starts to the door ) WELLS Where are you going ? ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WELLS ( getting in his way ) No  --  no  --  you 're not , Andy ! I 'm not going to let you ! You think it 's strength ! I tell you it 's weakness . You 're not alone in this . My future 's at stake  --  just as much as yours ! And Fran 's ! What 's to become of us , now ? What are we going to do ? p. 131 ANDREW WELLS If you want to got away  --  you can go to Europe to live . WELLS Now ? ANDREW WELLS Yes , everyone 's going ! There 's plenty of money !  --  and you 've lots of friends  --  WELLS ( bitter ) Friends ! I can just hear them ! Whenever I leave a room - " poor woman - poor woman " - No , Drew - No ! I 'm not going to let you do this to me . I 'm not going to be anybody 's " poor woman " the rest of my life . Not for anything  --  or anybody ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor woman , Mother . WELLS How can you say a thing like that to me ? FRANCES WELLS That father went to another woman - he had to ! because he did n't have anything here - just emptiness  --  ANDREW WELLS Do n't blame your mother , Frances . I would have gone anyway  --  probably  --  FRANCES WELLS ( going on ) You do n't know what love is , Mother ! You think it 's weakness and you think you 're strong ! But you 're the weakest person I know ! You talk to father about weakness ! You never faced up to anything in your life . Just ran away  --  into your room and shut the door - and called long distance . Father had to stay out - out and face things - alone - for us . And now ! Now when he needs us - you turn against him - when he 's down - you give him a last kick - your 're a poor woman , Mother ! Yes ! p. 132 WELLS ( frantic ) Fran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true , Mother  --  I 've always thought it  --  I  --  WELLS Do n't let her talk to me like this , Drew ! I ca n't stand it ! I ca n't stand any more  --  ANDREW WELLS ( gently ) Go to your room now  --  Margaret  --  and  --  WELLS ( weeping ) You think it , too ! You both think it ! - that I 'm a poor woman . You know what I 've tried to do for you  --  all my life  --  fought to make your life successful and  --  I 've made a rich life for both of you  --  and now  --  you call me poor !  --  you  --  ANDREW WELLS ( soothing ) Yes , I know , Margaret . WELLS All I 've built up ! With my own hands ! And now you tear it down , both of you ! And tear me down ! A poor woman ! A poor woman ! FRANCES WELLS I 'm sorry I said that , Mother . If it hurts you like this  --  but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not true . ( to Margaret ) Go and rest now  --  Margaret . WELLS ( mounting hysteria ) Rest ? How can I rest ? When my own child  --  p. 133 ANDREW WELLS You 'll find your way  --  you always do  --  alone in your room . WELLS ( going to the door ) Alone ! Yes , alone ! Without anyone now , without  --  ANDREW WELLS Go with your mother , Frances . FRANCES WELLS I want to stay with you , father . You need me more . ANDREW WELLS ( to Margaret ) Try to get Nelly on long distance . WELLS ( going off - weeping ) Long distance ! Long distance ! Nothing near to me - nothing close ! ( she goes ) Frances ( pause - then hesitant - not knowing how to begin ) I understand it , father , all of it - And - I love you . And - ANDREW WELLS ( profoundly touched ) Thank you , my dear . FRANCES WELLS And I want to help you . ANDREW WELLS You have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I never have - but that 's because you always seemed so far from me - till today . Today you seem near to me , father - very near . I understand you , father ! ANDREW WELLS What happened to you last night , Frances ? - that today you so understand your father ? p. 134 FRANCES WELLS ( quiet ) Nothing happened to me , father . ANDREW WELLS No ? Then why  --  FRANCES WELLS I wanted it to - but I 'm too much of a coward . ANDREW WELLS Where were you ? FRANCES WELLS I was in a room - with a man- ( rushing on - self - accusing ) And then I could n't face it ! and began to cry ! So he went off and left me alone there . It 's not easy to get yourself ruined , father . All your friends are such little gentlemen ! ANDREW WELLS Why did you want to get yourself ruined ? FRANCES WELLS Oh  --  a lot of reasons - revenge , I guess  --  was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WELLS On mother , mostly . ( crying out ) And then when I got there  --  I began to cry for her  --  cry for my mother  --  like a perfect sap . ANDREW WELLS ( pitying ) Poor little frightened child . FRANCES WELLS You see , father - I 've made a clean breast now  --  and I feel better - so I understand why you have to make one . p. 135 ANDREW WELLS No  --  not now . I ca n't do that now . FRANCES WELLS Why not ? ANDREW WELLS ( wearily ) Oh the strength has gone out of it now . FRANCES WELLS Because of us ? ANDREW WELLS ( nods ) It 's just another weak thing weak and cowardly . FRANCES WELLS What are you going to do then ? ANDREW WELLS ( stares ahead ) I must find another solution . FRANCES WELLS I am going away now - till I get strong again  --  Come with me father - we 'll start our new lives together . ANDREW WELLS No , darling . FRANCES WELLS Yes - we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have each other now  --  we 'll  --  ANDREW WELLS No  --  darling  --  No ! Your father may be a coward , but he is not as week a coward as that ! FRANCES WELLS But it would help me , father ! It would give me something to live for  --  ANDREW WELLS You have much to live for , my dear . p. 136 FRANCES WELLS What ? ANDREW WELLS You are your mother 's daughter  --  you must have some of her ambition . FRANCES WELLS Ambition for what ? ANDREW WELLS For a good life . FRANCES WELLS I do n't know any good life , father  --  without love . I am one of those that can not live without it  --  Mother does n't know anything about it . It 's just passed her by . But you and I father  --  we know life is n't worth living without it . That 's why you 're broken now , father  --  because you 've lost it . Like me . Not because  --  ANDREW WELLS You 'll find it again , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANCES WELLS You , too , father . ANDREW WELLS No . FRANCES WELLS Why do you say that ? ANDREW WELLS Everything has its time , dear . It came to me already - late . ( pause - then ) Well , dear - I need to be alone now for a while - go to your mother - for me - now ! FRANCES WELLS Oh father ! I 've got to change my dress first . p. 137 ANDREW WELLS Later . FRANCES WELLS ( excitedly ) Now father ! I have to change it ! I ca n't bear it on me ! I want to tear it off ! Ca n't you understand that ? Tear it off ! ANDREW WELLS ( with sudden passion ) Yes ! Tear it off ! Tear it out ! Tear it to pieces ! Trample on it ! Crush it ! Crush it into the dust ! FRANCES WELLS ( looks at him uneasily - then crosses to the door - turns ) I 'm sorry I could n't help you , father . ANDREW WELLS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? ANDREW WELLS You understood . FRANCES WELLS I understood - yes . But I do n't find the right thing to say  --  I 'm like mother . She never finds it . Frances goes . ANDREW WELLS ( alone  --  sits at his desk  --  then reaches down to the lower drawer  --  takes out the revolver  --  looks at it  --  hears someone - covers it quickly with a paper - his statement ) Harkness on . DAVID HARKNESS ( in door ) Have you forgotten me , Mr. Wells ? p. 138 ANDREW WELLS Oh  --  oh  --  Dave . DAVID HARKNESS I do n't want to disturb you , sir . But I knew you were alone . Senator Colter just went out to get the last edition  --  then I saw Mrs. Wells go by  --  and just now , your daughter  --  I wondered if you 'd forgotten me  --  gone out the back way . ANDREW WELLS ( half smile ) I was just thinking about that , Dave . DAVID HARKNESS I 'm glad I caught you . ( hesitates ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not quite yet , Dave . You came just a beat too soon . I am going to have to ask you to wait just a few minutes longer . DAVID HARKNESS All right . There is no hurry now . ANDREW WELLS I think I may have quite a good little story for you then  --  one I shall like you  --  very particularly  --  to handle . DAVID HARKNESS Thank you . ( turns to go - turns back ) May I take Lord Jim along - while I am waiting ? ANDREW WELLS Of course  --  but it is only a matter of minutes . DAVID HARKNESS ( picking up the book from the desk ) Do n't hurry  --  I have plenty of time now . Jose Campos finished his own story . Sure did the right thing  --  for once  --  do n't you say so . p. 139 ANDREW WELLS Yes - I do . DAVID HARKNESS ( going back to the door ) Saved a lot of people - a lot of trouble . ANDREW WELLS Yes - he did . Harkness starts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DAVID HARKNESS ( turning ) Yes ? ANDREW WELLS Come back here a minute . There 's something I want to ask you  --  a favor . DAVID HARKNESS Ask it . ANDREW WELLS ( hesitant ) It 's about my daughter , Frances . DAVID HARKNESS ( a little self-conscious ) Oh . ANDREW WELLS You remember we were talking about her last night . DAVID HARKNESS Yes . ANDREW WELLS I had the feeling that she interested you . DAVID HARKNESS She does . ANDREW WELLS And that you knew quite a good deal about her  --  understood her . p. 140 DAVID HARKNESS I ca n't say that . ANDREW WELLS Satin slippers in the mud , you said  --  and  --  DAVID HARKNESS That was just about her being ill . ANDREW WELLS She is ill , Dave . And I ca n't help her . Now now  --  I am having to - to go away now - and  --  DAVID HARKNESS Away ? Why ? ANDREW WELLS ( smiles a little ) Just be patient , Dave . DAVID HARKNESS I 'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - very - at this moment particularly . ( quickly ) But if I stayed , Dave , I could n't help her . I 'd only make her worse . ( ause - then ) I am asking you to help her . DAVID HARKNESS Me ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . DAVID HARKNESS What can I do ? ANDREW WELLS First  --  stay around . Be there  --  if she needs you - and she will . Second - ( pause - then ) Can you get off the job for a couple of weeks ? - take your vacation now  --  or  --  DAVID HARKNESS I think so . p. 141 ANDREW WELLS Then I want you to take Fran out West  --  to one of those ranches out there - where there is sun and fresh air  --  will you ? DAVID HARKNESS Yes  --  I guess so  --  if you  --  ANDREW WELLS I want you to make all the arrangements  --  fly out with her  --  and stay with her  --  till she 's on the way up  --  Will you do this ? DAVID HARKNESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Dave . ( pause ) That 's all now  --  just a few minutes more  --  and you 'll have your story . DAVID HARKNESS ( turning to go again ) Thank you , sir . ANDREW WELLS ( gets up - crosses to him ) You 're a good boy , Dave . ( thumps him on the shoulder - awkwardly ) Now - come back in five minutes . Harkness goes . ANDREW WELLS ( takes up the revolver again  --  looks at it  --  puts it back in the drawer  --  goes to window  --  stands looking down  --  then he opens the window . the curtains blow in - he starts to put them aside . ) Enter Margaret . WELLS Drew ! What are you doing ? p. 142 ANDREW WELLS ( startled - confused - almost mumbles ) Fresh air . WELLS ( crossing to the window ) Yes  --  but not so much draft ! We never open this window . ( she closes it - puts the curtains in order ) ANDREW WELLS ( now - controlled again ) What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to me for a minute , Drew . ANDREW WELLS Yes ? WELLS I know what to do . ANDREW WELLS Yes ? WELLS I see that you ca n't make the campaign now . I see that clearly  --  You 'd be too  --  ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS And I see why you have to resign  --  I  --  ANDREW WELLS ( weary ) Then we agree . WELLS Not entirely . You must not make the statement you have in mind . Oh I know you think I say this for me and for Fran - But that 's not it . We 've been on top of the heap too long - we need to be brought down - ( sudden - unexpected feeling ) It 's you I 'm thinking of , Drew ! I ca n't bear it that you have to be humiliated and  --  Do n't make that statement , Drew ! p. 143 ANDREW WELLS I do not intend to . WELLS What are you going to say ? ANDREW WELLS Nothing .

WELLS ( pause - then - a little hesitant ) I would like to go with you , Drew  --  if I may . ANDREW WELLS That 's out of the question . WELLS But  --  who will look out for you - if you 're alone ? ANDREW WELLS ( laughs a little ) Why  --  I guess I 'll look out for myself  --  I always have . WELLS ( quickly ) Oh Drew , do n't hurt me like this ! I know I 've let you make all your trips alone  --  never as much as packed a bag for you  --  I always thought that was beneath me !

WELLS ( smiles ) Thank you , Drew  --  that helps  --  ( she reaches for a cigarette - he lights it for her silently  --  but her hand trembles a little ) When are you coming back , Drew ? ANDREW WELLS I 'm never coming back . WELLS You mean you are leaving me ? ANDREW WELLS Yes . WELLS Oh , Drew ! Not now ! Oh no ! Not just now ! ANDREW WELLS This is the moment , Margaret . One of those moments when everything comes together  --  makes a pattern . I can just - step out - Bill is here to see to everything  --  say everything - WELLS And what of me ? What 's to become of me ? ANDREW WELLS Why  --  you 'll go on just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're gone ! ANDREW WELLS Why not ? Everything 's in your name . You 've always managed everything alone . p. 145 WELLS No ! Not alone !
