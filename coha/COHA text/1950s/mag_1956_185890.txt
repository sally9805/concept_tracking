STORIES ( 309 pp. ) - Jean Stafford , John Cheever , Daniel Fuchs , William Maxwell-Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> The writers of these 15 short stories have several things in common . They are middle-aged ( ranging from 41 to 48 ) and have thus been exposed to two world wars and a depression . They are Northerners , so their theme is largely urban frustration instead of the fashionable Southern predilection for rural decay . And like most contemporary short-story writers , they are at their best when remembering their childhood . The exception to this rule is Brooklynite Daniel Fuchs , who here ignores adolescence and is the only one of the four to deal with the excitements of earning a living . <P> Author Fuchs 's three stories are lit with flashes of gallows humor , particularly Twilight in Southern California , in which an egocentric Pagliacci of the novelty business grimaces and clowns his way through a party while his firm takes the long slide into bankruptcy . The finance company has his Cadillac ; creditors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer their phones when he calls-and the harried businessman responds like a hermit in the grip of a mystical experience : " He saw it all . He could n't stop talking . He would get his backing , he would recoup , he would be a power in the industry again . Everyone would smile . He would be popular , universally admired . His visions soared ... " Just as quickly , his hopes plummet . But at the story 's end , there is the feeling that a man who has already dodged disaster in Berlin , in Prague and in Paris will suffer only slight damage in Southern California . <P> Five of the stories are by Jean Stafford , the biggest name and most accomplished craftsman of the group . Mostly , she is writing communiqus in the unceasing wars between children and adults and between the innocent and the worldly . Her work is marred by a truly feminine absorption in detail so that sometimes she seems to be writing for visitors from Mars , as in Bad Characters with its loving description of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story with its total recall of a short ride in a self-service elevator ( " an asphyxiating chamber with a fan that blew a withering scirocco ; its tinny walls were embossed with a meaningless pattern of fleurs-de-lis ; light , dim and reluctant , came through a fixture with a shade of some ersatz material , " etc . ) . Author Stafford is best where her heart is , in fictitious Adams . Colo. , a town she loves and hates in about equal measure . <P> William Maxwell 's What Every Boy Should Know is perhaps the most moving and wryly humorous story in the book . Set in a Midwestern small town , it tells of young Edward Gellert 's stumbling entry into puberty and the total failures of communication between the very young and the rest of the world . <P>
