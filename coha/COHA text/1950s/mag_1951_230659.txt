KATHERINE MANSFIELD 'S LETTERS TO JOHN MIDDLETON MURRY , 1913-1922 ( 701 pp. ) - Edited by John Mldd/eton Murry-Knopf ( $6.50 ) . <P> <P> Soon after Katherine Mansfield met John Middleton Murry , she said : " Why not take a room in my flat ? " Murry did . It was 1912 ; he was a bright , broke young man who had just traded Oxford japes for London journalism , and was bent on pedaling away from his lower-middle-class origins as fast as the bicycle of English letters would carry him . Katherine was pedaling too-from her native New Zealand and an unhappy marriage . She had written her first short stories , the haunting , plot-shy evocations of children , moods and places that would eventually rank her close to Chekhov . <P> Two Little Silkworms . For a while , Murry and Mansfield platonically polished each other 's egos , but soon they were deeply in love and anxious to marry . Katherine 's husband made difficulties about a divorce , and they could not actually marry until 1918 . By then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-staff . What was the trouble ? This latest batch of Mansfield-to-Murry letters ( two-thirds of them never before published ) never explicitly tells , but some strong clues are spilled between the lines . <P> Katherine Mansfield was a very ill woman as well as a greatly gifted writer . Racked by rheumatism , pleurisy , pulmonary tuberculosis ( she died of it at the age of 34 ) , she was also dogged by devils of the mind : fear , guilt , frustration . <P> Both kinds of illness pried her away from Murry ; she spent much time in the south of France trying to recover , but even more in a kind of private hell . The letters are bulletins posted outside the sick room of her soul . At first , pet names ( she was " Tig " or " Wig , " he was " Jag " or " Bogey " ) and candid passion masked the symptoms . " I love you with every inch of me . . . You are my perfect lover . . . Hold me , Bogey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your arms . . . Now I am giving you all sorts of little hugs and kisses , and now big ones and long , long kisses . . . What a farce it is to be alone in bed in the spring when you are alive ! " <P> Money worries were flicked aside : " We 'll be two little silkworms and live on mulberry leaves . " Every dawn brought a poet 's bonus in beauty : " The air is like silk today and there is a sheen upon the world like the sheen on a bird 's wing . It 's very quiet except for the gardener and his spade and warm as fine wool . " <P> Pigeons Are Cruel . World War I came and stayed , and Tig began hitting the dips on her psychological roller coaster . Her only brother was killed , she was trapped in France , and Bogey worked overtime in a War Office job . After the war , Bogey edited a little magazine . Tig chipped in with reviews , and shuttled wearily between   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
