Dear TIME-Reader : <P> <P> IAIHEN Walter Winchell confided " to his public recently that Marilyn Monroe was to be a TIME cover subject , he added this understandably skeptical comment : " I ca n't imagine them digging up anything people have n't read before . " TIME 'S readers can decide whether Winchell was too skeptical . <P> Around the world , 33 reporters in 26 cities sought out playwrights , directors , actors , producers , and-most significant-the all-but-forgotten principals in our subject 's earliest years . TIME 'S Hollywood reporter , Ezra Goodman , scribbled his way through 65 notebooks ( see cut ) - one for each person interviewed-and had enough energy left for a note to me . <P> Altogether , Goodman reports , our Los Angeles bureau staffers conducted more than 100 interviews in California , Arizona and Idaho over the course of the six weeks they were on the story . " It was an experience traveling with Marilyn , " Goodman writes , in recollection of an interview that took place in a chartered plane en route to Sun Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " disguise . " This consisted of a Venetian gondolier 's brown straw hat with white band , smoked glasses , no makeup at all , a man 's heavy black sweater , grey striped trousers , high heels and a floor-length mink coat . <P> " We can guarantee , " wrote Goodman , " that anyone donning this getup would automatically get more attention than Khrushchev at Disneyland . But Marilyn appeared surprised that anyone noticed her . " In the course of another interview in her dressing room , Marilyn suddenly said to Goodman : " You look like a writer . " <P> Goodman ( warily ) : " Oh , yes ? I 'm not sure that 's a compliment . " <P> Miss Monroe : " Writers , when you 're talking to them , look like they 're listening to you . " <P> For how well Goodman and his colleagues listened , see Cinema Writer Brad Darrach 's " To Aristophanes &; Back , " beginning on page 74 . <P> Cordially yours ,         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
