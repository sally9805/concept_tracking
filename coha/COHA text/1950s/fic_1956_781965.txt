 | " I would think it , " Hannah agreed , smiling a little . The man stood there , leaning easily on the barrel of his gun , a little bent over it . He was a tall man . . . around six foot she guessed , and broad and hefty with it . He 'd have to stoop , she thought , to go through most doorways , and swing a little sideways . She tried to place his age , though it was difficult because of the stubble of beard on his face . He was weathered about the eyes , and the hands folded over the gun barrel were rough looking and had lost the smooth fullness of first youth . His neck , though , was firm and solid looking , not gaunted or slack-muscled like Samuel 's . She thought , maybe , he would lack ten years , or even fifteen , of being as old as Samuel . Samuel had lost the exact count of his age , but he figured it to be fifty , or thereabouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he could be a mite younger . She watched him as he squatted by the spring , then . He took off his old battered buffalo-skin hat and creased it , making a drinking vessel of it . Dipping it in the water , he drank long and deep . His hair , Hannah saw , was a sandy , nondescript brown , clubbed carelessly with a thong of leather , and none too thick on top , and now that he was nearer she could see that his eyes were the same sort of light blue as Samuel 's . . . the kind of blue eyes that were so light they looked faded , but remained keen and sharp in a man 's head to the end of his life . She judged that commonly he did not wear a beard , for it was no more than a stubble and would easily have grown out in a few days in the woods . Seeing her looking at his face he rubbed it ruefully with his hand . " I had n't thought to stumble up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but I do n't commonly pack a razor with me noway . " Hannah dropped her eyes and made no answer , not knowing what answer could be made to such a statement . Pa shaved when the notion took him . Sometimes he 'd take a spell of shaving every few days . Then again he 'd go all winter without . Just depended on his notion . She did not know what the man meant , so she stood , eyes lowered , and made no reply . " You got anything to eat with you ? " he said , then , shaking the water from his hat and putting it on . She withdrew the bundle from her dress . " Meat . " " Not , I reckon , " the man said , grinning , and she noticed that when he grinned there was a small pucker at the corner of his mouth . . . it whitened with the movement of his lips and sank inward , not much , but enough , she thought , that if a body laid a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide ? " Hastily she untied the cloth and laid the meat before his eyes . " I 'd of brung more , " she said , " had I knowed . " " I got nothin ' left but corn , " he said , and from the front of his shirt he pulled a pouch . " From the looks of that there bag , " Hannah said , laughing , " you ai n't got much of it left . " The man 's laughter joined hers . " I been travelin ' light an ' fast . Is it fur to yore camp ? " " Not more'n a few miles . " " Hit would n't disfurnish you , then , to divide up the meat ? "  | " Not e'er bit . " She handed him the cloth which held the meat . He took it and laid it on the ground . Then he spread the mouth of the pouch and poured the parched corn on the cloth beside the meat . " Well , " he said , " hit ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yer stummick fer a time . Let 's cat . " Hannah shook her head , feeling shy . " You eat . They 's a plenty at camp , an ' I c'n do without till I git back . " Tice Fowler laughed . " Well , I baited good yesterday myself , so I ai n't exactly starvin ' . Come on an ' set . " Indecision sat hard upon her , and she pondered , not knowing what to do . But she was hungry , and if the man had baited good yesterday and was heading for some place not too far away , she might as well eat too . Deciding quickly she sat down with her back to the rocks and began eating . The man squatted nearby , his hand reaching out for the food and his eyes kept constantly glancing about . Neither of them talked as they ate , but when they had finished all of the meat and corn , and both had drunk again , the man said , " I ai n't to say as full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep me from hurtin ' . " Ruefully he added , " I war n't fixed to travel so fur afoot . I been over acrost the river , an ' I had a little brush with the Indians an ' lost my horse . " " I reckon you hated to lose yer horse , " Hannah said . " Well , sure . . . a man does , but , " he grinned , " hit 's better sometimes to lose yer horse an ' keep yer hair . " Hannah nodded . " I 'd think it . " She picked up the square of cloth , shook it , folded it and slid it inside the front of her dress . The man watched her . " You never said what yore name is , " he said , finally . She slid her look over him . He confused her . He shifted from one thing to another too fast for her . Pa , now . . . Pa never left off one thing till he had it worked over properly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or another . That was what she was used to , Pa 's worrying a thing till he had all the juice out of it . Now , if he 'd been telling about having his horse taken from him by the Indians he would have told precisely what he was doing when it happened , every thought he had , every move he made , and he would have weighed both his actions and his thoughts against each remote possibility . It gave a body time to think , listening to a long-winded man as she 'd done all her life . With Pa she always had time to know what to expect , and time to think what to say . But this Tice Fowler , now , he moved around amongst his words too fast for her . . . telling about a brush with the Indians one minute and then shifting to ask her name without hardly taking a good breath in between . She brushed her hair back . " Hit 's Hannah Moore , " she told him . " Pleased to make yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was standing , making a small , stiff bow , which still further confused her . It made her feel foolish and awkward . . . made her feel stiff-handed and clumsy , and a deep embarrassment spread within her , making it impossible for her to look any longer at the man . Her eyes dropped to her feet , bare and scarred with briar scratches . A feeling of heat crept up her throat and  | into her face . She could barely make herself mumble , " Pleased to know you . " Then she whirled and picked up her gun . " I 'd best be gittin ' on back . " The man picked up his own gun . " Hit would n't displeasure you none , would it , fer me to go with you ? " " You kin if you 're a mind to , " she said . Without waiting to see whether he followed or not she strode off through the woods . Her ears , however , told her he was on her heels . She was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her unbeknowing to her . It filled her with discomfort . She did n't see how she could have been so careless . She wished she could find a way to tell him it had never happened to her before . She wondered if she might not say , off-handed , that she 'd just looked about and had seen nothing , which would be the truth . She had n't given over watching . . . and she had just looked . But it was also true that she had seen nothing , when he was there , somewhere , to be seen . Naming it , she decided , trying to make out she had n't been careless , would be worse than just leaving it lay , for any way you looked at it , she had been . If , watchful as she was used to being , she had n't peered out a grown man , then she 'd been careless in some fashion and there was no getting around it . She wished she could know where he 'd been to escape her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finally gave it over . Since he had n't told her , she did n't think she ought to come plain out and ask . In the broad stretch of the forest ; free of undergrowth so that there was no need to walk single file , the man came up beside her . She glanced at him sidewise . " You said yore name was Tice , before . " He laughed . " Commonly that 's what I 'm called . . . Tice , short for Matthias . " " Oh . " " Hit puzzles me , " he said , after a moment , " what a lone woman would be doin ' in the woods . " She slid another quick look at him to see if he was poking fun at her , for his remark went foolish to her . What would anybody be doing in the woods ? It ought to be plain as day what she 'd been doing . But his face was serious , so she gave him an answer . " Huntin ' , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yore menfolks doin ' while you 're out huntin ' ? " " They ai n't but Pa , " she told him , " an ' he is laid up with a hurt leg . " Understanding immediately he nodded . " You 've had no luck , though . You 're in need of meat , are you ? " Hannah shook her head . " Not fer eatin ' , we ai n't . Pa 's leg could do with a piece of fat meat . I was hopin ' to run up on a bear , mebbe . " From his height the man looked down at her and grinned . " What would you of done had you come up on a bear ? " he asked . Now she knew he was making fun . She forbore to look at him but she gave him a direct answer . " I would of kilt it . . . dressed out what I could pack . . . an ' I would of bound Pa 's leg with the fat . " She knew the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush steal up her throat into her face . She quickened her step to pull a little way in  | front of him . In two or three paces he had closed the distance . There was no trace of laughter in his voice , now , when he spoke . " How did it happen yer pa hurt his leg ? " " His axe slipped . " He nodded . " Hit c'n happen . Bad , is it ? " " Bad enough , " she admitted , and then , as if the remembrance of Samuel 's red-streaked , sick-smelling wound drew the words from her she went on . . . " he was choppin ' some firewood , not even fellin ' a tree , mind , an ' his hand slipped . The blade was sharp , jist whetted , not nicked nor nothin ' . He war n't thinkin ' but to chop up a little wood fer me to cook us a bait of vittles . Of a sudden his hand slipped . Next he knowed the blade was grindin ' against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striding along beside her , then she confessed , " Hit 's closin ' up the poison inside . " Tice Fowler 's face went sober . It could kill a man , that kind of thing . He 'd seen it do so , with a bullet hole , a knife gash , or even with a long splinter of wood . When a wound closed over with the pus and poison shut inside , it could kill a man fast . There was never but one thing to do . " Yer ma , " he said gently , " is knowin ' of what to do , I reckon . " " They ai n't but Pa an ' me . My ma died when I was a youngun . " The man took that information in , then , still gently , he said , " Ma'am , I do n't aim to be pryin ' into yore affairs , but what are you a doin ' , jist the two of you camped way up here on the Kentucky , so fur from the settlements ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' or goin ' . Have you done lost yer-selves ? " It made Hannah angry that he should think they had lost themselves . Heatedly she said , " My pa is Samuel Moore , an ' never in his entire life has he ever lost hisself , or me . Not fer a hour . We come down the Ohio on the flatboats with Major Clark . He told that he aimed to build a fort at the mouth of the Kentucky . They was several aimed to travel together up the river to Boone 's fort . But he changed his plans an ' went on to the Falls , an ' them others was too fainthearted to foller their intentions . Not Pa , though , " she went on proudly . " Pa held to his'n . Me an ' him built us a raft , an ' we have come this fur . We was doin ' good , too , till Pa hurt hisself . " " You have done good , " Tice agreed . " How long since you took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Seven days , " she said , " an ' we been in this place two . " " You done real good , " Tice said , approvingly . " Is it fur , " she asked , " from here ? Pa thought to make it in two weeks , give or take a little . " Tice nodded . " He would of done so , in my opinion , if he 'd not hurt hisself . Hit ai n't much further . If , " he went on to say , " you 'd not run into no Indians . The trouble is , ma'am , travelin ' the rivers is the worst way they is of goin ' . Old-timers in the country stay off the rivers , if they c'n do so . The Indians use ' em , mostly . It astonishes me some you 've not done had a brush with ' em . This time of year , too . Come spring they take to prowlin ' considerably . You 've  | had good luck not to see e'er'n . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . I reckon where you come from you 've not had to think much of keepin ' clear of the redskins . " " Not in my lifetime , " Hannah admitted . " Hit was mostly settled country . But Pa has fit ' em . " Tice kept to himself his thought that Pa must not have fought them lately , or he s ould not have forgotten that to make camp on the bank of a river was risky , and to go so far as to build a fire at night was purely asking for trouble . " You 're from somewheres near Fort Pitt , are you ? " " Not real close , no . Hit was the border country . We allus thought it was in Virginny , but they been quarrelin ' so with the Pennsylvany folks over where the boundary lays that Pa said we 'd jist git out an ' leave ' em have it whichever way they wanted . Said we 'd head fer Kentucky . Boone 's fort is where he picked . Is that where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " I 'm from Logan 's stand , a piece further down . " The hope that had showed in her face , unknown to her , died away . Quickly the man went on , " But I 'd be pleasured to guide you to Boone 's . " " No , " Hannah said , " hit would misput you . Pa ai n't able to travel yit , an ' they 's no knowin ' when he will be . Hit would belate you wherever you 're goin ' . " " Ma'am , " the man said earnestly , " we do n't leave folks in trouble in this country . We 're all used to bein ' misput fer one another . Hit 's the only way we 've got along . " Hannah thought about what he had said , then acknowledged its truth . " I reckon it would be the only way , in a new country . You been here long , have you ? " " Longer than some , but not so long as others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first , like Darnel Boone an ' Ben Logan an ' Jim Harrod an ' some others , but I been here a little over two years . I come from the Holston country , myself . I was at Boone 's stand fer a time . Facts is , I come out with Dannel two year ago last September when he brung his woman an ' younguns out from the Watauga . But I never took to the country up around his fort , nor to the people either , I reckon . I knowed Ben Logan an ' David Cooper back on the Holston an ' I kept wishin ' to be where they was at , so one day 1 jist lit out from Boone 's an ' took me up a piece of land on the Hanging Fork . Hit ai n't but half a day from Dave 's place , nor much further from Ben 's fort . " " I have heared Pa talk of Logan 's fort , " Hannah said , " but I do n't know as I ever heared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would . Folks off knows about the ones that heads up the forts , like Dannel an ' Ben . . . but they 's a heap more good men . in the country never heared of . " " They would be , sart'n , " Hannah agreed . " Hit takes a power of folks to settle a country . Is this Hanging Fork you named another river ? " " A creek . . . yes . Hit 's but little settled yit . " " Hit 's sightly , is it ? " " Well , it suits me . Hit ai n't so level as some . They 's hills about , but the  | land is rich an ' good in the valleys , an ' they 's water aboundin ' , an ' the cane grows good . If you 've been brought up in sight of hills you feel more to home where they 're at , though they 's a plenty over all the Kentucky country . These is little hills that do n't bear down on you none . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hannah nodded . " I been used to hills , myself . " " I 'd think it . I was once in yore country . Hit 's sightly , but I do n't know as I 'd blame yer pa fer leavin ' if his title war n't clear . " " That was the way of it . " " A man do n't like the idee of workin ' a piece of ground all his days an ' never knowin ' does he own the land or not . " " That was the way Pa held it . " " Then he done right , in my opinion , to leave it to ' em . He 'll do good in Kentucky . " They had come , now , to the place where the hill plunged off into the valley . " You 'd best let me go first , " Tice said , " an ' you tell me if I go too fast fer you . " " I 'll keep up , " Hannah told him , " I c'n manage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . " She promised and he led off . Going down was a whole lot faster than coming up had been , Hannah thought , remembering the long , laborious crawl up the steep slope . She kept hard on Tice 's heels and watched approvingly as he picked the best places for his feet , hardly slowing as he made his choices , knowing , it appeared , almost instinctively , the stones that would roll , the branches that would give and crackle , the underbrush that would be stubborn about giving way , and avoiding them . He was mighty good in the woods , she had to admit  --  not , she thought loyally , as good as Pa , maybe , but as good as a man had need to be , and better , she remembered blushingly , than herself . Seeing as he 'd offered to help out , and doubtless had the time , she decided that if she 'd been unlucky about finding game this day , she 'd had good luck anyhow , in running up on Tice Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody with them that knew the country , and she did n't mind owning it . When they came to the bottom of the hill he stopped . " Where did you come out of this cane thicket at ? " " At the foot of the clift , " she told him , " but hit 's no matter . list take a sight on that highest sycamore yonder . Hit 's not fur , then , to the camp . " Tice glanced at the sun and then hitched at the belt that held his knife and hatchet . " Well , we 'd best be gittin ' on , I reckon . " " Yes . " They waded into the cane . Tice looked around from time to time to see how she was getting along . He was careful not to let the bent canes snap back in her face , but otherwise he left her to follow her own way . When they had got through they stopped a moment to rest . " A cane thicket , " Tice said , blowing out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of to git through afoot . Hot , with all that growth up over yer head , an ' no air to speak of down under . "  | Hannah nodded and brushed at her hair , laughing , " I tangled with most of it , head-on . " Tice moved on . " Which way ? " " Upstream . " They went more slowly , more silently , now . The woods were dim and still about them , and the ground underneath was spongy and damp . Hannah felt the dampness on her feet , and the sponginess , and the soles of her feet were suddenly cool after the heat of the cane thicket . It was a good feeling , for her feet were sore . When they came by the hazel bushes she stopped at the small elm she had marked . " I had it in mind , " she said , " to put a elm bark poultice on Pa 's leg if I did n't run onto somethin ' fer a piece of fat . " He drew his knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fer drawin ' out the poison . I 've not ever tried it myself , though . Where would you want that tree girdled ? " Hannah measured up about the reach of her arm . " There , I 'd think . " Below his hacked girdling mark she stripped off the bark . It came off loosely , in large pieces , a damp ooze forming instantly on the suddenly naked trunk of the tree . When Hannah thought she had enough , Tice gathered up the most of it and tied it around with a grapevine , tied it then to his belt , and Hannah knotted some long strips and slung them over her shoulder . " I 've not ever , " she confessed as they started on , " used elm bark on a gash before . But it 's good fer drawin ' a risin ' to a head . Pa had a risin ' once on the back of his neck . Hit riz up as big as a hen egg an ' I poulticed it with slippery elm . Hit drawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But fat meat is best fer a gash . . . leastways that 's what I 've allus heared . Hit jist war n't a lucky day fer runnin ' onto e'er thing , though . " " Tomorrow I 'll seek out somethin ' , " Tice promised . " I 'll swing out over acrost the river an ' likely come up on somethin ' . " " I 'd be obliged to you , " Hannah told him . They walked for a time in silence , then Hannah , in Samuel 's way of worrying a subject , though she did not know it , went back to her day of hunting . " I got the track of one bear , up there on top the hill , but hit was a old track . I made it anyways a full day old , mebbe more . I follered it till I could tell they was n't no use , an ' I never seed e'er other trace . " She did not think , either , how she , in this short time , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appealance , could now talk so easily with him . There was no self-consciousness in her telling of coming up on the old bear track . The man walking beside her was a hunter , accustomed as Samuel was , as she herself was , to the woods . He would know the importance of what she was telling . He would put himself in her place and know how she had found the bear track , studied it , known it as an old one immediately , but he would have also known that you had to follow a track a piece to make sure . He would know exactly how her mind had worked , and how , when she was certain , she had made her decision to cease following the track . There  | was no need to explain to him . Any man used to the woods would know what had happened , would agree she had been wise to leave off . Tice nodded his head . " They 's times like that . Not e'er trace . " " I misdoubt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game bein ' skeerce . Hit was jist not a lucky day fer it . " " Not in these parts , it ai n't , " Tice told her . " Hit 's skeerce around the settlements , now . But in these parts they 's a plenty . Hit was jist a bad day fer it . " They came to a slough of brackish water backed up from the river . Across it lay a mat of fallen trees . Tice stepped onto them and they swayed under his weight . " Take keer , " he warned her , " an ' do n't slip . " She watched him safely across , wonderingly . This morning she had crossed alone , sure-footed , bare toes gripping the limbs , the crossing taking none of her thought and little of her care . Here was a man warning her , her that had been taught when she was a little one and never needing warning since , her that could have given most men lessons in taking care . In all her life she had known well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their path many times , stayed in their home , hunted with them . She could not remember that any had ever said to her before , at least not since she had been a grown woman , " Take keer . " And he 'd said , coming down the steep slant of the hill , " I 'd best go first , an ' you tell me if I go too fast . " Maybe he thought she was awkward on her feet . She would n't wish him to think that , but he could see for himself she was n't . Maybe , seeing as he had caught her careless by the spring he was thinking she needed looking after . Likely that was it , she thought , and chagrin wormed around in her stomach . In no way could she undo that , now . She sprang onto the bed of massed limbs , swayed with them easily , then crossed as lightly as if she had been walking on grass , never wetting a foot . At the bank Tice reached out a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart sank . She knew for sure , now , that he thought her careless and needing help . And then he further confused her . " Hit goes the quarest to me , " he said , chuckling , " a woman huntin ' . They is several of the womenfolks in the country kin shoot as good as a man . You take Esther Whitley or Jane Manifee . They are dead shots . I war n't in the country the time Logan 's was under siege by the Indians , but I 've heared ' em tell of it times without number . Dave Cooper has told me hisself , an ' he tells it that Esther an ' Jane both taken their places at the stockade as good as man could . " " Hit do n't wonder me , " Hannah said . " Nor me , that part do n't . But I do n't know if they ever went in the woods an ' hunted like a man . I have never heared of it if they have , an ' likely I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits an ' squirrels , little game that comes around a house-place , but I never knowed of e'er woman was good at huntin ' real game . " " Well , I ai n't as good as Pa , " Hannah said , quickly . " Hit 's to be expected you would n't be , " Tice said , comfortingly , " but the wonder of it to me is you bein ' any good at all . The way I make it , yore pa ,  | they bein ' jist the two of you , has raised you like you was a boy instead of a girl-child . " Hannah thought upon it . " Hit may be . I would n't say it war n't that way . But I 've took keer of the house-place since I was a little youngun , too . " " That would go natural . . . but the other do n't . Likely he never knowed e'er thing else to do , a girl-child left to him thataway , but keep her to his side in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " " Then that must be the way of it . " " Hit could be , " Hannah said again . " I never thought nothin ' of it before . " " No . Hit 's what you been used to . I c'n see how you 'd not think to ponder on it . " A surge of courage stirred up in Hannah , born of Tice 's kindness and understanding . " I ai n't , " she said , struggling to find the right words , " I ai n't commonly as keerless as you found me today . I do n't recollect ever bein ' caught out thataway before , an ' you need n't to tell me that once keerless is once too many . I know it is . I was jist lucky it was you . But I was taught better , an ' I misdoubt I 'll ever be caught so easy again . " Tice laughed . " They 's no call fer you to fault yerself . You never overlooked me . Could n't nobody of seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' not knowin ' if you was by yerself or not , an ' bein ' astonished , too , I hid . I was hid in that big crevice between the rocks . You could n't of seed a thing had you looked . You was n't in no way keerless . You had yer gun handy an ' ready , an ' you never ceased watchin ' . That 's all anybody c'n do , fer they 's no way you c'n spy out ever ' least thing in the woods . Nobody c'n do that , not even Dannel Boone hisself . That 's how come he was took by the Shawnees . " Relief flowed through Hannah . " I am glad , " she said . " I hated it , havin ' you think I had been so keerless . " " I never thought it . " Hannah pondered what he had told her , seeing it in her own mind , how Tice had arrived at the spring , had perhaps been bending over it to clear it of leaves , had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching just a glimpse of her , maybe , and then hid . There 'd been no chance for her to see him . A body , he 'd said , could n't see everything in the woods . That was why Dannel Boone had been took . " When was it , " she asked , " Dannel Boone was took ? " " In February . In the cold of the winter . " " Jist this year ? " Tice nodded . " He 's still captured . " " He was huntin ' , was he ? " " Well , he was huntin ' , but the way it was , him an ' a bunch from all the settlements was up on the Blue Lick makin ' salt . They was a big bunch of ' em . . , some from Logan 's amongst ' em . Dannel was huntin ' fer the party . " " Was they all took , or jist Dannel ? " " All of ' em . . . ever ' last man-jack of ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pore things . An ' you could ill-spare ' em in the country , doubtless . " " Hit was a main blow , all right . " Looking up Hannah saw that they had reached the camp . Pointing , she said , " There is the camp , now . Right there , under them trees . "  | SAMUEL had dragged himself out of the lean-to and was sitting propped against the bole of a tree , his leg stretched before him , eased by the folded blanket under it . He was dozing as they came up to the camp , his head drooped to one side , but his gun was laid across his good knee and one hand held it securely . Hannah thought how pitiful and poorly he looked , broken down , as if he 'd been cast aside . A man 's strength , she thought , was his proudest possession , and it goes swiftly , the pride with it , when he is struck down . Samuel had always been a strong man and a proud one . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shield between himself and life . But here , in a moment he was struck down , and as helpless as a young one he had to sit , dozy , under a tree , his shoulders , which could square to the heft of a heavy log , drooped and sagged , his long legs which could track an elk all day without tiring , stretched , already puny with illness , useless before him . She felt a pity at seeing him so , a great sorrow for him filling her , and a wish , which shamed her even as she wished it , that Tice Fowler could have seen him first in his great strength and pride , not broken like this . She wanted to straighten his shoulders , to lift his head , to waken him and have him stand whole and strong before Tice Fowler . He looked old sitting there , dozing . It took her by surprise . Pa looks old , she thought , he looks like a old , old man . She had never really thought of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing for him . His strength had not allowed for age , had withstood it , so that she had been aware all her life of nothing but height and strength and cleverness . Years had had no meaning where Samuel was concerned . She could not remember when his hair had not been iron-gray , nor when his face had not been lined . He had remained , since her first memories of him , the same , tall and gaunted and tireless . But now she thought , He looks old , Pa does , and a brush of fear ran through her , nameless and barely identified it passed so quickly . For Samuel awoke instantly at their coming and raised his head to peer at them , his hand moving instinctively on his gun . He blinked at them , stretching his neck to look up , and Hannah saw how corded were its muscles . " Well , " he said , then , " who mought you be , stranger ? " " Tice Fowler , from Logan 's fort . " Tice grinned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome , I would say . "  | Samuel grunted . " I d'know as Kentucky had e'er thing to do with it . Bad luck with my axe , mostly . " " That 's what yer girl was tellin ' me . " Tice leaned his gun against a fallen log and laid off the trappings of his belt , knife , hatchet , the bundle of elm bark . " You 'll be wantin ' a fire , I reckon , Hannah , " he said , " to make up that poultice . " " Yes . " Tice looked around for the axe , found it in the lean-to , and hoisting it to his shoulder went off , whistling , to cut wood for the fire . " How 'd you come up on him ? " Samuel asked , motioning with his head at Tice 's retreating back . Hannah told him . . . told him in detail as she knew he wanted to hear , as he himself would have told it  --  how she had reasoned to look first for deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill across the cane thicket ? how she had crossed , climbed the hill , found the bear track and followed it , leaving out nothing of her thinking or reasoning . Samuel nodded as he listened , following her , seeing her movements , reasoning with her mind , making her decisions with her . She worked with the elm bark as she talked , breaking it , cleaning it , piling it beside her . She told how she 'd been drinking at the spring when Tice had come up on her , how she had feared she 'd been careless , but where Tice had hidden and how he had excused her . " You war n't at fault , " Samuel agreed . " You done good . He was right . You cai n't seek out ever ' livin ' thing . " Now that Samuel too absolved her the last worry about it left her . She felt free of it , and she went on to tell how Tice had said he would guide them to Boone 's fort . " Though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . He was took by the Shawnees durin ' the winter . " " I had n't heared of it , " Samuel said . " I did n't figure you had . You 'd not named it . " " The fort still stands , I reckon . " " I reckon . He never said different . They war n't at the fort when they was took . They was a party of ' em off , makin ' salt . " Samuel shook his head . " Hit happens . I am sorry to hear of it . I taken a likin ' to Dannel Boone . I had thought to have more of his company . " Hannah was mounding twigs and leaves for the fire , now . When she had finished she picked up the iron pot and went toward the river for water . She met Tice , his arms loaded with wood . " I got the fire ready , " she told him . " I 'll git it goin ' straight off , " he promised . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , no cover anywhere about , that tongue of beach in the river , the easy access and ford , but he could see no help for it at present . Samuel 's leg must be opened and poulticed . They could not leave with him tonight . He , Tice , could keep a careful watch . . . and hope . He said none of this , however . There was no use saying anything . Tomorrow , if Samuel could be moved , they would go inland and make camp until he could travel . He had a fire blazing when Hannah came back with the water . She moved  | a flat rock into its heat and set the pot upon it . Tice laid fresh wood on the fire , stirred it until it caught . Hannah brought up the pile of elm bark . " We 'll have to open that gash , I reckon you know , " he told her . She nodded , bending over the pot of water , watching it . Then she looked up at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it this mornin ' . You want to take a look at it now ? " " Mought as well . " They walked over to Samuel . " I 'd best look at yer leg , now , Samuel , " Tice said to him . " I reckon so . " Hannah knelt and unbound it . The bandaging which she had wrapped about it that morning was tight on the leg now , so much had the swelling increased . The skin looked stretched and hard , and the red streaks went now almost to the thigh . The wound itself was puffed looking , its edges white and crusted . Tice looked at it , lifted it gently , handled it , smelled of it as Hannah had done . Samuel 's eyes never left his face , watching intently for some change of expression . The fear of losing the leg lay there , naked in Samuel 's eyes , the hope of saving it made him search Tice 's face . But Tice was well schooled in hiding his thoughts . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , looking at such a wound , but it did not reveal the shock he felt . He laid the leg back down on the blanket . " Hit 's got to be opened , ai n't ' it ? " Samuel said , then , expelling a great breath . " Yes , " Tice told him . " Hit 's full of poison . . . they ai n't no use to lie to you. , , " I figured it . I c'n smell it myself . Well , git it done an ' over . " " Mebbe you 'd ruther Hannah to do it . " Samuel looked at her . She was standing , her hands hanging loosely , waiting . Her face was blank of any expression save that of waiting . Whatever she had felt on seeing the leg again her face did not show . It was calm , expressionless . Loosely she stood , waiting . She was thinking one thing . What 's got to be done , has got to be done . She was not afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught her that there are some things you can not escape . Hurt and pain are among them . What 's got to be done , has got to be done . She accepted it , now that Tice had said it too . She would do now whatever they said . " She 's good with animals . . . calves , cows , horses . . . I d'know , " Samuel said . " Whichever you 'd ruther , " Tice said , kindly . " You ever done sich ? " " Once . Feller I was travelin ' with got cut up in a fight . " " Hannah ai n't never . You 'd best , I reckon . " Tice bent over his belongings and drew out his knife , tested it . " You got any rum ? " " Git it , " Samuel said to Hannah . She went to the lean-to and came back with a jug . Tice took it and handed it to Samuel . " Drink all you c'n hold . "  | Samuel drank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough . Then he dropped it . " That 'll do , I reckon . " Hannah went to the fire , saw that the water was beginning to get hot and dropped into it a pile of the elm bark . She went back to the men , wiping her hands on her skirt . Tice was cleaning his knife on a large sycamore leaf . " We 'll give that rum a chance to take hold , " he said to her . She nodded . Samuel was leaning back against the tree , his eyes closed . They watched him and Tice took out a small whetstone and honed the knife blade . That was the only sound Hannah could hear , the slide and grate of the knife blade on the whetstone , like breathing in and out , regular and unhurried . Over and over and over Tice slid the knife across the whetstone , not watching his hands at all , keeping his eyes on Samuel . Finally Samuel 's head lolled , he belched , his eyes opened , squinted , he grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head sagged . " Reckon it 's time , " Tice said . " Hold his foot so 's he wo n't jerk . " In spite of her strength on the foot , Samuel jerked when the knife went in . She watched Tice 's hand poised over the wound , steady as if he 'd been going to dress out a deer , saw it hover a moment then sharply descend and slice ruthlessly through the wound . Samuel 's foot jerked suddenly , but there was no sound from him . Out of the corner of her eye , sidewise , she saw his hand grip the hump of a tree root beside him . She kept her eye on the knife in Tice 's hand , but cornerwise she also saw Samuel 's hand grip , saw the knuckles whiten , the fingernails claw , then the knife 's work was done , the hand slowly loosened its grip and went limp . " He 's swooned , " Tice said . She sighed . " Hit 's the best . " " Yes . " Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reopened wound , cleaning it as best they could . " I got a little piece of that linen left , " Hannah said . " I 'll git it . " Tice laid a square of the clean linen over the gash while Hannah made a poultice of the mash in the iron pot . Samuel stirred uneasily when she laid the poultice over the wound , but did not speak . " He 'll sleep a while now , " Tice said . She nodded and bound the poultice in place , using the clean linen until it was gone , finishing then with what was left of the old . " Hit ort to help , " she said , " gittin ' all that stuff outen there . But I 'd feel better if I had a piece of fat meat to put on it . " " I 'll git you a piece tomorrow , " Tice said . " Mebbe this elm bark will keep it drawed out till then . " They had finished with Samuel 's leg . Tice laid him more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll go wash off my knife . " " Well , I 'll fix us a bait to eat . " Tice grinned at her . " Hit 'll be welcome . What we eat at midday has done wore out on me . " Dark came on soon after they had eaten and Hannah tidied up the camp  | by the light of the fire . When she had finished she asked Tice , " Had we best leave Pa where he is at , or move him into the lean-to ? " " Jist leave him be , " he told her . " I 'll be handy . " " I 'm goin ' to lay down , then . You c'n have my blanket if you want . I 'll not need it in the lean-to . " She felt unaccountably weary of a sudden . " I thank you , " he said , " but I 'm more used to doin ' without than you . " She did n't argue . She rolled up in the blanket and lay down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel 's couch . She could see Tice making ready for the night . He scattered the fire first , and then picked a tree , beyond Samuel , laid his gun down and sat , propping himself against the tree . He 's not aimin ' to sleep , she thought , he 's fixin ' to keep watch . She called to him . " If you 'll wake me when it 's time , I c'n watch out so 's you c'n git a little sleep . " " I mought , " he answered , but she did n't much think he would . She determined to wake herself . She could when there was need . She 'd done it many a time when Samuel had wanted to get up earlier than common . All she had to do was think of it before dropping off , and , as if a bell had sounded , when the time came she was awake . She put her mind to it now , and then closed her eyes . It was black dark when she awakened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean-to , looked at the sky . She judged it was near midnight . Certainly the dawn was several hours off yet . She shivered as she crawled out of the warm bed and reached back for the blanket to wrap about her shoulders , yawning . Tice heard her and called out softly in the darkness , " You need n't to git up . " She found her gun and made her way over to him . " I 'd ruther to , " she said . " If you 're aimin ' to hunt in the mornin ' , you 'll need a mite of rest yerself . " He grunted and she could see a blur of movement by the trees . He was standing . " If they 's e'er trouble , " he told her , " hit 'll come from acrost the river . I do n't look fer it , understand . Hit 's jist best to take keer . You got yer gun ? " " Yes . " " Well , then . . . . Yer pa ai n't stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hit must of . The sleep 'll do him good . " " Yes . . . well , come daylight , if I do n't stir , call me . If he c'n stand bein ' moved , we 'd best make camp further away from the river . " " Ai n't you aimin ' on takin ' the raft on up the river ? " " No , ma'am . That would be the last thing I 'd aim on doin ' . We 'll move an ' camp an ' wait till yer pa c'n travel . Then we 'll strike out through the woods . Well , I 'll lay awhile now . " Hannah settled herself by the tree . She was fully awake now , felt fresh and rested . There was an open spot in the trees just over the camp and by leaning her head back and resting it against the trunk of the tree she could see the  | stars , and a little , pale disk of moon off in the west . You could tell , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the night was clear . And you could tell , too , that the winter was over and summer coming on . They moved , the stars did , changing places in the sky with the hours , and changing places as the seasons passed them by . She thought about it , wondered about the stars and moon , wondered why they 'd been put there to shine in the night . . . why they moved . It was n't a thing she could study out , though . It was past e'er human body 's knowing , she guessed . There were some things that could n't be studied out . She felt a breath of wind on her cheek . There , now . . . wind was one of them . What was it ? Where did it come from ? What moved it unseen around the world and across the land ? It would stir through the night , ruffle the leaves and shake them , bend the limbs  --  but when the dawn was near , when the dark was just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , it would quieten as if it listened for the sun . As still as death it would be then , at that time just before the light streaked into the sky , so still that , if you were stirring then , you could hear your own breath coming and going in your throat , and hear your own heart beat . The way of wind . . . it went queer and odd to a human body . And the way of rain , blowing up in the clouds , the clouds splitting and pouring it down . She named over to herself the things she could in no way study out . . . wind , the moon and stars , rain , sunlight , clouds , storm , the fall of rivers down the land , the rise and flow of water . There was a power of things , she told herself , no human body could ever know the straight of . You could , in time and with study , know the ways of birds and animals , and even folks . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts beat and they breathed in the air . One way or another they all moved , flew or walked , swam or ran . They all died , too . The sun , now , and the stars , the wind and the rain , the water in the rivers , those things went on forever . How could it be , she wondered , that a thing that lived should come to the end of its living , and those things that had no life in them should go on forever ? " Hit ort , " she told herself , " to be the other way round , looks like . " Then she laughed , to think of the sun and stars and moon dying . " The folks would die fer sart'n , then , " she said . She never talked about such thoughts as these . Once when she was a child she had tried to tell Samuel about the sound the branch back of the house made , running over the rocks . It went , she had told him , like singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reckon , " Samuel had said , grinning at her . " I kin , " she had told him stoutly . " Hit 's a singin " Go to sleep , go to sleep , go to sleep . ' " Sam had not laughed then . Sternly he had bade her to keep such foolish talk to herself . " Hit ai n't nothin ' but water runnin ' over the rocks , " he 'd said . " Do n't go gittin ' foolish fancies in yer mind , Hannah . They 'll make you go quare in the head . . . folks 'll think you 're tetched , an ' they 'll mistrust you . " So she had never again named the things she thought to Samuel , or to anyone  | else . But she was always thinking them , just the same . It did no harm to think , as far as she could see . Samuel moved in his sleep , stirred and muttered , threw one hand from under the blanket . She watched until he had settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again she thought about moving camp tomorrow . . . today , now . Wondered where Tice would pick . Wondered if Samuel could be moved . Thought of the problems and shook her head . Below , she could hear the liquid sound of the river , running shallow around the tongue of the beach . She smiled in the dark . In spite of Samuel , running water did make a singing sound .  | IT WAS STILL half dark when she stirred , quietly because of Samuel who was still asleep , to waken Tice . With one hand she pushed herself up from the ground . The muscles back of her knees were cramped and stiff from her long sitting , and she stood a moment , flexing them slowly to loosen them . The river , she noticed , showed lighter where there were no trees to cast shadows . It looked dull and gray , like tarnished pewter , and it was barely moving . East , across the river and back of the hills , the sky was beginning to come light , pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink showing , but still dark overhead , with stars not yet dimmed . The air was very still , and there was no sound at all except the sound of the river , a wet , flowing sound . There was not yet any stir in the trees , of birds or of wind , no movement of any kind . She stood and rubbed her legs , feeling the stillness , thinking how this hour was always the stillest of the night , as if every living thing was holding itself In waiting for the first red touch of the sun . Only she was awake and moving . She sniffed the air . There was the damp of the river in it , and the smell of the cold ashes , something left over yet of cooking smells , and the fresh green smell of the trees . You would know , she thought , without looking that you were camped in woods on the bank of a river . She studied the sky . No clouds blotted the stars . The sun was going to rise clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turned and walked softly to the lean-to . Tice came awake immediately when she called him , sitting up suddenly and hitting his head against the low roof of the shelter . Forgetting the woman he cursed briefly . She laughed and he remembered , spoke his apologies , and crawled outside . He took a quick look around . " Ever'thing all right , is it ? " " As fur as I know , " she said , moving off and beginning to gather wood for the fire . " I 'll not wait , " he told her , " fer somethin ' hot . list give me some meat an ' u piece of that cold pone . I 'll eat on the move . " She handed him the meat and a chunk of bread . She knew he wanted to he several miles downstream by sun-up , knew he had to be if he expected to kill anything today . He saw to his gun and started off , chewing already on a hunk of the meat . He did n't look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently . Then she busied herself with the fire . He had been gone about an hour when Samuel awakened , and the first  | shafts of the sun were stabbing down across the trees beyond the river , dappling and darkening the water , giving it color . Samuel rolled over , winced and groaned . Hannah went to him , taking him a drink of rum and hot water . " You feelin ' better this mornin ' , are you ? " He drank before answering , his eyes studying the morning , judging it and deciding upon the weather . " I d'know as I do . I feel all tuckered out , weaklike . I d'know as I could stand up even if both my legs was good , but I reckon the pain is some better . Flit 's aimin ' to be a fair day , ai n't it ? " " Yes . " She took it as a good sign that the pain in his leg was better . The air was now full of sound , birds chattering and twittering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talked a young fox squirrel ran , unafraid , across the clearing . Hannah looked at Samuel and laughed . " Now , ai n't he the smart one ? " When she had fed Samuel and redd up the camp she got out her bag of odds and ends and took from it linen thread and a big bone needle and set herself to mending . Samuel 's spare buckskin had a rent in it . Her own skirt was torn . The meal pouch was worn thin in two spots . Her big hands guided the needle and strongly pulled it through the materials of the skirt and skins . Samuel grew weary of sitting and hunched himself down into the blanket and dozed off . Once Hannah laid down her stitching and crossed to feel of his forehead . It was hot , but not , she decided , uncommonly so . The morning passed , the sun warming the air even under the trees until the day was like summer . The warmth was good , and Hannah felt as if her skin stretched and loosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold did n't bother her overly much , but given her choice she liked it best when you did n't have to hug a fire . She felt more alive , somehow . When Tice came in around midday he had a great hunk of bear meat slung over his shoulder . " Had good luck , " he told them , sliding it to the ground . Hannah took it over from him , smiling at the sight of the good streaks of fat , and Tice went to talk to Samuel . " You feelin ' some better today ? " Samuel did n't know . " I jist feel tuckered . Jist ai n't got no stren'th left , seems like . " " Yer Ieg painin ' you any ? " " Some . . . but no more'n common . Seems like mainly I 'm jist all gone inside of me . " Tice looked at him , critically . " I was hopin ' we could move back away from the river this mornin ' . Me an ' Hannah could likely pack you between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try , then , when we 've eat . " " Where 'd you run up on the bear ? " Tice squatted in the dirt . " Acrost the river . " He picked up a twig and began to draw in the dirt . " I 'd crossed over , up a piece . . . you recollect where the river makes a bend an ' a little slough , like , backs up ? " Samuel nodded . " Well , that 's where I crossed , an ' I 'd went near five miles , I 'd say , beyond .  | I 'd jist loitered a little swale up a piece an ' was climbin ' out , an ' they was a long patch of level ground lyin ' there , woodsy but clean underfoot , an ' I heared him snifflin ' . I laid low , waitin ' , an ' he hove into sight purty soon , lookin ' big as a mountain . I waited till he got square in front of me , an ' then I let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Samuel confessed he had not . " I ai n't been listenin ' as good as I could . " " Well . . . I did n't know but you mought of . But hit was a right smart piece off . I brung the head . I got him right under the ear . " Samuel nodded . " Hit 's the best place . Hit 's the surest . You brung the head in with you , did you ? " " I thought mebbe you 'd want to see how it was I shot him . " " I would like to . " Tice got the head from the pile of meat , brought it to Samuel , squatted beside him and turned the head to one side . " Right there is where the bullet went in . You c'n see . " Samuel took the head , turned it , studied it and nodded . " Purty a shot as I ever seed . You done good . Do n't know as I ever done better myself . " " Hit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done better , though . This one mought be a speck high , would n't you say ? " Samuel studied the head again . " I would n't say so , " he said , finally , " no , d'know as I 'd say it 's high . Mought be . . . jist a mite , but I d'know as I 'd say It was at all . In my opinion you done real good . I d'know as I ever seed a purtier shot . " " Hit was fair . " Tice tossed the head back onto the pile of meat and wiped his hands with a mat of grass . " Wish I could of went with you , " Samuel said , wistfully . " I wish you could of , too . Hit wo n't be long till you c'n be on the track again . " " I d'know . The way I feel right now it 's liable to be longer'n I 'd of figured . " " That 's on account of us havin ' to cut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing is . You 'll pearten up tomorrow or next day , likely . " e folded his long legs under him and leaned back against the tree across from Samuel . " Some of that bear meat when Hannah gits it fixed is goin ' to strengthen you , too . You been needin ' fresh meat . " Samuel brightened . " Hit could be . They ai n't nothin ' like fresh meat to strengthen you , fer sart'n . I do n't reckon you thought to bring along the liver ? " Hannah , hearing , called out , " He done so , an ' it 's in the pot right this tninnit . You 'll be eatin ' the stew in no time at all . " " I love bear meat as good as e'er meat I ever put in my mouth , but I relish e liver best of all , " Samuel confessed , laughing . " An ' me . Unless it mought be buffalo liver . " " Buffalo is hard to beat , " Samuel agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon the liver of a animal is its best part . You take deer , now . . . I 'd ther to have the liver as all the rest of it put together . " Tice nodded . " To eat fresh , I would . But deer dries better'n buffalo . is n't dry out so hard . "  | Samuel agreed . They sat silent , then , each thinking over the qualities of game they had killed . It pleased them they had agreed upon liking the liver best . It made a bond between them , made them kindred souls . Hannah could tell they were pleased and it pleased her in turn that they should get along so well together . She did n't probe her pleasure , but she made the liver stew happily , glad to have it , glad to see the two men take to each other . Samuel did n't like every man he ran across . Some he purely had no use for , and she could tell within a few minutes how he felt . He liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerly anyhow . He would have , but in a different way . Samuel broke the silence . " Hannah was tellin ' me that Dannel Boone was took by the Shawnees . " " He was . . . back in February . " " Said they was a party of ' em , makin ' salt . Was it jist Dannel took , or all of ' em ? " " All of ' em . Thirty-eight in all . " " Hit puzzles me , " Samuel said , " how a bunch that big could be took . " Tice hesitated before replying . " You know Dannel Boone , do you ? " he said finally . " Not to say know him . . . I do n't . I talked with him one time , is all . I took to him , though , that one time I talked to him , an ' when I got ready to come to Kentucky I said I 'd make fer Boone 's fort , fer I liked the man a heap . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever knowed . But folks says they is somethin ' quare about the way them salt makers was took an ' one of ' em got away when they 'd got as fur as the Shawnee towns , an ' the way he told it when he come back was that Dannel had been took first . He 'd been out huntin ' by hisself whilst the others was boilin ' down salt . He said of a sudden there come Dannel , amongst the almightiest pack of Indians he 'd ever seed . Right in the midst of ' em Dannel was , a leadin ' the way . The men all sprung fer their guns , but Dannel called out to ' em . Said it would be the best not to resist . Said they was too many of the Indians . Said they 'd all git kilt , an ' hit would be the best to go along peaceable . Now , they would n't of , without Dannel had said so . They 'd of ruther died . But Dannel said he had the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no harm , would n't be mistreated nor nothin ' . Said they would be treated like prisoners of war an ' would be took to Detroit to the British where they could be ransomed . Said it would be best , fer they 'd all be kilt if they tried to fight . " Tice stopped talking then and Samuel waited . After a moment he went on . " The way this feller told it was that they was some thought the Indians would n't of found ' em had Dannel not led ' em to the camp . " Samuel stared at Tice . " That would be the same as sayin ' that Dannel Boone had give ' em away . " " Hit 's jist the same as , yes . " Samuel thought about it . " Well , from what I have heared of him , " he said at last , " hit do n't go to me like he 'd be that kind . "  | " Hit goes against what ever'body knows of him . But this feller had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they found out fer a fact , from listen in ' to the talk , that Dannel had offered to take the Indians to the camp . . . offered , mind you , without waitin ' to be asked . An ' he said Dannel got along so good with the Indians you 'd never know but what he 'd lived amongst ' em all his life , way he set out an ' put hisself forrard with ' em . " " This Blackfish , this chief feller . . . he kept his word about not mistreatin ' ' em , did he ? " " He did on the journey . That was all this feller knowed about , fer when he got the chance to git away he taken it . Hit 's purely a mystery . Do n't nobody know what to think . Dannel 's woman give him up as dead an ' went buck over the mountains where they come from , with her younguns . Had she stayed on a spell , she 'd of knowed he was safe , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now , nobody knows . " Both men were silent , thinking . Then Samuel said , slowly , " What 's yore opinion ? " Tice cleared his throat , importantly , now that he had been asked outright . " In my opinion , they 's somethin ' do n't nobody know about yit . Hit 'll take more'n what I 've heared to make me believe Dannel Boone played the part of a traitor to his own folks . " Samuel nodded . " That 's about the way I make it . " He pondered again , then shook his head . " Thirty-eight took . An ' ill-spared , I 'd reckon . " " Could n't be no worse , hardly . Hit weakens us terrible bad not havin " em amongst us . " " I 'd think it . " Hannah came , then , with the pot of stew . She placed it on the ground between them and handed them each a pewter spoon . " Eat all you c'n hold , " she told Samuel . " Hit 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke apart and she had thickened the soup with meal so that the pieces of liver floated in a heavy broth . Samuel dipped Into it , then took his knife and speared a piece of the meat . " Lordy , but that 's good , " he said . " Hit 's what I been wantin ' , though I did n't know it . " When they had finished eating Hannah took the pot away and ate her own meal . Samuel and Tice wiped their knives , sheathed them , and Tice broke a green twig for each of them to chew on . " I do n't aim to be pryin ' , " Samuel Said , " but I have wondered some how you come to be in these parts afoot . " Tice lay back against the tree trunk . " Well , we been losin ' several horses lately . Indians been plunderin ' a right smart , so some of us said we 'd make a raid acrost the Ohio ourselves an ' try to git a few back . Me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer horses back ? " Tice grinned . " We got ' em , an ' the others taken ' em on . But I had a little mare they 'd got which we never found , an ' I had a wish to keep on lookin ' a mite longer . War n't no use the others hangin ' round when we 'd overtook seven , so I told ' em jist to take ' em on in an ' I 'd go on a little sashay of my own . That was the way of it . "  | Samuel chuckled and Tice pulled at his chin ruefully . " I found my mare all right , but I never to say got her . An ' I lost the horse I was ridin ' . But I felt real lucky to save my hair . The way of it was , they 'd missed the horses we 'd took an ' they 'd been follerin ' us . I allowed they would so I back-tracked an ' come up on ' em camped . I figured to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sneak over an ' take the mare . I 'd saw her hoppled out . I would of , too , only the dogs give me away . I had to scamper out of there in a hurry , I c'n tell you . An ' they cut me off from my horse . They never give up chasin ' me till I 'd crossed the river . Hit was nip an ' tuck there fer awhile . " " I 'd think it . " Tice sighed . " Hit was a good horse to lose to them varmints , too . I allus hate losin ' a animal to ' em . They do n't know how to take keer of ' em . Mistreat ' em almost as bad as they do a human . But I 'll git ' em both back one of these days . " He pulled his long length up and threw his chewed twig away . " Reckon Hannah 'll be ready to be goin ' by now . " " Likely . " Hannah had been sorting and tidying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were . " How did you aim to work it . . . movin ' Pa ? " " If we could make a kind of litter by stretchin ' a blanket acrost two poles , hit 'd be best . If you c'n carry one end , that is . " " I c'n carry it . " " I mought could lean on you , " Samuel put in , " an ' mebbe make out to limp along a piece . " Tice shook his head . " Hit would do harm to yer leg an ' set us all back . Me an ' Hannah c'n pack you , I figure . " He chose two hickory saplings and chopped them down , stripped them of limbs , brought them to Hannah . They laid the blanket over and under the poles and Hannah laced it in place with thongs , pulling and stretching to make sure it would not give . Then they laid it beside Samuel . " I 'd best put a piece of the fat meat on that leg afore we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Tice agreed , " but do n't waste no time . Hit 's midevenin ' now , an ' we 'd ort to git started . " " You got some place in mind ? " " Hit 's a place I know , yes , " he nodded . " How fur ? " " Close to four mile , I 'd say . . . an ' it 'll be rough goin ' in places . " " I 'll make haste , " Hannah promised . She unbound Samuel 's leg , carefully laying aside the bandaging . " They ai n't no more cloth , " she said , " we got to keep on usin ' this . " The elm bark poultice had dried out overnight and was stuck to the wound . Hannah fingered it and Samuel groaned . " I 'll wet it , " she told him . Little by little she worked it loose , being as easy as she could , but by the time she had finished Samuel was white and sweating . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not one of them could fool himself about that . It was no better at all . None of them said so , however . Each could see for  | himself and there was no use speaking of it . Hannah laid the moist , raw piece of bear fat against the wound and bound it in place . " I never did put much dependence in elm bark , " she said . " No , " Samuel agreed , " but I do n't reckon it did harm to try . " " No harm , " Tice echoed . The leg rebandaged , Hannah took Samuel 's feet , Tice his shoulders and they started to lift him on the litter . But when the weight of his body pulled on the leg Samuel screamed out suddenly and then went limp . " He 's swooned , " Hannah said quickly , " make haste , now , an ' git him on the litter afore he comes to . " When they had him on the litter Tice looked furtively at Hannah , wondering if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . If that leg was so touchy he could n't bear to be lifted , it was in a bad way , and no doubts about it . She said so little of what she was thinking . . . and she showed so little , going on about doing the things that had to be done . He thought it was lucky for him she was turned that way , for if she 'd been like some women he 'd seen , grieving and taking on , it would have been harder on all of them . Hut it made him wonder if she 'd even thought what could happen . She acted like she thought it would n't be but a few days till Samuel was on his feet again , ready to travel . But then , he thought , so did he . Likely she just was n't giving any sign . He looked at the tidy piles of belongings . She had sorted them well , he saw . In the lean-to were the things to be left . . . the spinning wheel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pewter spoons , the extra bar of lead . But heaped to take with them were the powder , the meal , the guns , the axe , the pouch of necessaries , and a hunk of fresh meat . " I c'n make a trip tomorrow for the things in the lean-to , " she said , seeing he had noticed . She did n't need to explain that her sorting had taken into account the fact that if the things left were never recovered , they would have the essentials with them  --  axe , guns , powder and immediate food for Samuel . They loaded themselves and laid Samuel 's gun and the axe on the litter beside him . He moaned when they lifted him , but did not entirely regain consciousness . " Hit 's jist as well , " Tice said , " it 's goin ' to be rough on him any way you look at it . " He led the way , following the river upstream for about a quarter of a mile , then heading away from it . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshy Swale through which they floundered , bogging down to their knees frequently , but keeping going for there was no place on which to lay the litter while they themselves rested . Both were winded and sagging when they came out of the marsh to firm ground . They laid the litter on the ground and Tice swiped his forearm across his lace . His face was red and wet with sweat . Hannah picked up the hem of her skirt and wiped her own face , across her forehead , around her nose and mouth and chin . Her hair had straggled loose and absent-mindedly she tucked It hack in place , looking curiously about her . Whey were in a meadow of rye grass and a few hundred yards away the  | woods began . Back of the woods , not too far away , a group of low-swelling hills lay . Tice saw her looking . " The place I got in mind , " he said , " is at the foot of that least knoll to the left there . They 's a spring handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood with her feet braced apart , her hands resting on her hips . She was breathing easier now , as was Tice . She looked back across the marsh to the line of trees marking the river . Not any more would they follow its bending course . She did n't know but she was glad to put it behind her . She did n't care for water travel , and then you could n't see , she thought , what the land was like from the river . Hardly ever did the trees open out so you could see what lay beyond . It was just sliding along on top of the water , the trees always moving past , not changing in their kind or color very much , the banks high in places , low in others , but always the trees closing them in . It was going to be good , she thought , to see the country . . . like this meadow , now , with grass already up to a body 's knees , and the mounds of the hills beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a lot of talk about this country . She wanted to see it . When Samuel could travel . . . She put the dart of anxiety from her . . . when Samuel could travel they 'd be passing right through the midst of it . There 'd be time to look about , and it would be spreading itself right before her . " You got yer breath ? " Tice asked , recalling her . She nodded and stooped to her end of the litter . Not until then did she notice that Samuel 's eyes were open . " You 've come to yer senses then , " she said . Tice looked around . " We ai n't jostlin ' you too much , are we ? " Samuel shook his head . " Some . But not more'n you 'd expect . Go on when you 're ready . " In another hour they reached the place Tice had in mind . It was a good place , Hannah thought . The spring flowed from the rocks at the bottom of the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut away the rocks beside it until an overhanging roof was formed . Beneath the overhang was a flat space , a shelter from wind and rain . A rockhouse , Hannah thought , was just a wide , roomy , shallow cave . Before it , south , down the slope , the woods ran , opening into the wide , flat meadow . It was sightly , she thought , pure sightly , and a feeling of pleasure lifted inside her . But Tice was working swiftly , piling leaves in a corner of the rockhouse for Samuel 's bed . She went to help and he left her with it , going , himself , to cut boughs to give it more softness . Wfrn they went to move him , Samuel waved them aside . " Set me down there by the couch , " he told them , " an ' I 'll git myself onto it . Hit 'll go easier , in my opinion . " They watched him as he slowly inched himself off the litter onto the bed they had made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , then his shoulders , with another rest . White and sweating he worked away at it , until finally he had humped all of himself over the pole onto the leaves . Then he sighed . " I ai n't hopin ' to do that no more fer a spell . " " No , " Tice told him , " next time you c'n walk away from that bed . " He turned to Hannah . " I 'll go fer the rest of the things . "  | " I aimed to go tomorrow , " she said . " They 's no need you makin ' e'er pother trip . " " They 's no need you goin ' tomorrow , either . You fix him somethin ' hot to eat . I 'll be back when I git back , but it 'll be after dark . " " Well . " After she and Samuel had eaten she sat by the fire , drowsing , rousing now and then to put another stick of wood on it , comfortable in the warmth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partial roof over her head again . It was going to be good , she thought , to have a cabin soon . She weighed her feeling , laughing at herself , looking at her big hands , thinking of her strong , big body . She could walk all day on the track of game , and loved to . She could swing an axe and fell a tree as quickly and as expertly as Samuel . She could wrestle a plow from sun-up to sun-down behind a team of oxen , and had . She could lift and work and endure , alone or beside a man . Tint , she reckoned , for all a woman could do what a man could do , she was different inside . She , Hannah , loved a house-place , too , and a fire on a hearth , and the clack of a loom and a slow-growing pattern in cloth . She closed her hands and looked at them and felt in their palms the shuttle and the taut stretch of the warp . She felt the flax tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slay . She felt the treads under her feet and pushed with one bare foot against the earth as if the harness were there to respond . Oh , the ways of a woman were her own and not given to any man to know , the shadows and the lights in her kept still and strong inside . They were a secret to her and a strength . They were the sign of the Lord to her , that she was different from men . She grieved for the loom left behind . But she would have a loom again , she told herself stoutly . She would have a better loom and a bigger one than the one left behind . In this land she would carve out her own loom . She k new how she would do it . She would search out a tree and fell it , and hew it square herself , and then she would carve out the beams and when they were done , she would peg them together . In time she would weave strong cloth upon it . She , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have . She roused when Tice returned . " I brung it all , " he said , " savin ' yer spinnin ' wheel . I aim to go fer the balance of the meat I hung up in a tree over there , an ' I 'll git the wheel fer you then . " She gave him food and he ate , and she could tell how weary he was by the way he ate , slumped and lifting the food to his mouth slowly . " You are , aimin ' to keep watch again tonight , are you ? " " We c'n risk it without in this place , " he said . When he had finished he pulled himself up and went to lie near Samuel . Ile was asleep almost instantly , his breathing heavy , mingled with Samuel 's snores . Hannah covered him with her own blanket . Then she lay down near the fire , warmed from her long sitting beside it and sleepy , and in some way , eased and content .  | WITH THE ROOF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah lost the feeling of temporariness , the unsettled and uprooted feeling which had lived with her during the long journey and the overnight camps . No matter how familiar things were , an iron pot , a blanket , even one 's clothing , no matter how well known the routine of building a fire and making johnnycakes , when you rose each morning knowing that the night would bring you to a new and different place to sleep , when you slept each night knowing that the morning would move you on , you had a feeling of something inside you , she thought , slipping out of place , uneasy and sliding and shifting . She had accepted it as necessary  --  she had even become adjusted to it , but she had never become accustomed to it . It was not a natural way of life to her . She was used to a fixed and steady base , from which she might go out each day in any direction , but which , inevitably , was waiting for her return . On this journey there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on , and on . Now she had something solid over her head again . Even knowing , as she did , that this was but another camp before going on again , it was different . It was fixed to the extent of at least a few days . It was a kind of a home . So the hours passed for her in a slow regularity , full of the familiar chores of the home-keeper , the cooking , the washing up , the tending of Samuel , and it was only when she totaled up the days that they seemed to have passed astonishingly fast . A week they had been at the rockhouse , she reckoned one evening , and , startled , she wondered that the time could have escaped her so swiftly . Tice had gone after the spinning wheel and the rest of the bear meat on the second day . He brought the spinning wheel , but he did not bring the meat . " Somethin ' had got to it , " he said , " wolves , I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hit would of spiled in another day or two , anyhow , seem ' as it 's turned off so warm . " Tice hunted almost every day , keeping fresh meat always at hand so that Hannah had meat for stews for Samuel and fat pieces to keep on his leg . In spite of the poultices , however , Samuel 's leg did not heal , and in spite of the good , thick stews , he continued to waste away . Almost daily his face became gaunter and leaner , the skin gray under his cheekbones and loose over his jaws . His eyes had taken on a locked , clouded look , lusterless and dull . Hannah  | had the feeling sometimes when she waited on him that he did not see with them any more , that if she had passed her hand before them they would not ave blinked . He had sunk , also , into listlessness . He took no interest in anything that went on about him . Hannah came and went , brought him water from the spring , told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb of a tree nearby . If he heard he made no sign . When Tice came in from the woods , Samuel did not rouse to question him , and if , thinking to interest him , Tice told him about his hunt , he listened apathetically , seeming weary even of listening . He ate what Hannah brought him , but more and more often he had no appetite for it , picking at the meat and rarely drinking all of the broth . While the rest of his body wasted away , his leg stayed swollen , and continued to swell until it was almost twice the size of his other one . It was so ? re and tender to touch that he screamed when Hannah changed the poules . This bothered Hannah greatly . " I 've not ever knowed him , " she told ice , " to take on so over a hurt . It do n't go like him . " " He has been bad hurt before ? " Hannah nodded . " Once he got his foot hung in a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' give him a right smart trouble , but he never let on . Not like this , leastways . All I ever heared him do before was to kind of groan a little . " Tice rubbed his hand over his chin . He was getting a pretty good growth of beard now , and it seemed to bother him . He rubbed at it often . " You know o'er other thing to do ? " he asked . " I never knowed of fat meat failin ' before . I d'know as they is e'er thing else to do . Without they was some charm would help . " " I do n't know of no charms . " Tice was sorry now he had n't paid more attention when he 'd heard womenfolks talking about charms . He 'd never put much dependence in them , but it was beginning to look as if only a charm could save Samuel , for he had n't the strength now to raise himself alone from his pallet . One of them must always brace his shoulders and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , trying , when he was told , to eat or to drink . But neither of them could hide from themselves or from each other that he was failing rapidly . " If he could stand it , " Hannah said finally , " hit mought do good to heat up some water real hot an ' dip them rags in it an ' lay on his leg . I have heared it would help . " " You 'd best try it , then , I sh 'd think . " But the first hot cloth laid to the leg was such an agony to Samuel that it brought him full upright on the pallet , screaming and clawing at Hannah , the sweat pouring down his face . " You 'll have to hold him , " Hannah told Tice . So Tice held him and Hannah doggedly applied the hot cloths , each time Samuel screaming and writhing under Tice 's hands , begging her to leave off . " Jist let me die . Jist let me die , but do n't put no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it , Hannah ! " She paid him no mind . She did n't even try to explain to him . Time after time she changed the cloths , keeping the pot on the fire , her hands looking  | as if they had themselves been boiled from being dipped in the scalding water , until finally Tice could stand no more of it himself . " You 'll kill him , Hannah . He cai n't bear no more of it . " She left off , then , let the last cloth cool on the leg and walked to scatter the fire under the pot . She stood , drying her hands on the tail of her skirt , then brushing her hair back . Tice followed her . He took in a deep , slow breath . " I d'know as I could of done that . " " You cut open the gash , " she reminded him . " But that was quick an ' over with . This . . . an ' his takin ' on so . " Hannah 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hate fer him to be tormented so bad an ' it not do no good . " They both saw the crows when they gathered in the tops of the trees down the slope that evening . They were sitting on the bank of the small run which flowed off from the spring . Hannah had washed the strips of cloth she used for bandaging on Samuel 's leg and had laid them on the grass to dry in the sun . She had gone to gather them in . Tice had been to fill the iron pot with water . Hannah , tired , uneasy about Samuel , had dropped to the grass and Tice had stretched out beside her . The sun was almost down . Already they were in the shadow of the hill behind them , but beyond the light fell across the grove of trees and over the meadow with an effect of startling clarity . Each tree in the small woods stood out singly and purely against the sky back of it , turned green-gold by some mixture of cloud and sun . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matted grass seemed plated with it , gilded , its green showing through only faintly . The air had a limpid languor and was still warm from the long day of sun . At the far edge of the meadow the tops of the hills were reddened , but their sides held the same peculiar golden light . " I have seed , " Tice said , putting aside the stem of grass he had been chewing , " I have seed it look like this after a rain , but I d'know as I ever seen it on a clear day . " Hannah thought . " I d'know as I ever either . Hit 's purty , ai n't it ? " " Kind of puts a spell on a body . " Then the crows came , flocking in from the marsh , settling in the treetops and their noisy , croaking clatter began . Tice and Hannah looked at each other , but it was Hannah who had the courage to say , " Hit 's a bad omen . " Tice shifted his eyes and muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hit 's a bad omen fer crows to cluster an ' croak thataway . Hit means a death . I 've allus heared that . " Because he had always heard it , too , Tice said nothing for a time . They both sat , silently , and watched the black wings wheel and circle , rise , lift , settle again , and all the time the raucous cawing went on . Then , thinking to comfort , Tice said , " They 's a heap of them old sayin 's ai n't true ever ' time . I 've allus heared it was a bad sign when a dog howls . . . you know , throws back his head an ' howls that lonesome , mournful kind of way ? But I had a hound , once , he 'd howl that way ever ' time I tied him up an ' left him by hisself . They say it 's a sign of a death , but in my opinion it 's more a sign a dog 's jist  | lonesome feelin ' of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' gatherin ' together they 're bound to croak an ' clatter some . I d'know as it means e'er thing . " " I d'know either , but I 've allus heared so . " " I c'n skeer ' em off if you want . " " No . Hit would n't change the sign none . " " I reckon it would n't . " They watched a while longer , then Hannah pushed herself up off the bank . " Hit 's gittin ' late . I 'd best build up a fire . He mebbe c'n eat some more of that stew if it 's het up . " " I 'll git up some wood . " Hannah stood a moment , looking down the slope over and beyond the crow-crested tree . To the left was the marsh and the green-banded river . Straight before her was the stretch of swelling , rolling meadowland . The light was fading but that peculiar golden quality lingered . The sky was clean of clouds except for a few broken curds in the south , they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills ran in a solid line , and , looking , Hannah had the feeling that the sky was pinned to the earth by the hills , pinned here behind her , stretched up and domed , and fastened once again behind those farthest hills . She searched it and the feeling increased , that she was tented here on a hillside , by the stretched gold cloth of the sky . She shook her head and smiled at Tice . He 'd think she had lost her reason if she named such to him . She pointed . " That 's the way to Logan 's , is it ? South ? " " That 's the way . Straight acrost this meadow , an ' through the hills . " " Hit 's a purty way to foller . " She stepped across the tiny stream with one long stride and went around the corner of the rockhouse . She gathered an armful of wood and began laying the fire . Hannah reckoned it was about an hour before day when Samuel awakened her , calling , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl Tice had whittled out of a piece of buckeye wood . He drank deeply . Then he began to talk , quietly and calmly . He spoke so quietly and calmly that it took her a moment to realize he did not know her , that somewhere in his mind time had eclipsed and her presence had become that of her mother 's . " Hit is a good place to stop , " he said , his hands moving restlessly . " They is water from the branch , an ' a plenty of shade fer a house-place . You 'll have water to hand , an ' a cool place in the hot of summer . An ' the ground is good an ' rich . I 'll lay the sill logs there , Ann , an ' I 'll make ' em stout an ' strong . Hit 'll be a pleasant home fer you I 'll build . An ' a chimbley . . . I 'll build you a chimbley like the old one . I 'll build you e'er kind you say . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I give you my word . You 'll not be yearnin ' fer the old place long , I 'll warrant . You 'll not be missin ' yer folks fer long . Soon , now , the little ' un will be here to take yer time an ' mind . An ' when yer time comes I 'll walk acrost the mountain an ' git that Granny Poe to do fer you . You 'll not he forsook . Hit 's a purty place to stop , Ann . A man c'n do better fer hisself in this new land . If you 'd cease grievin ' fer the old , Ann , hit would come  | easier to like . . . a man has got to do what comes best to him . " His voice went on and on , pleading , anxious , hopeful , sad . From his pallet Tice spoke softly . " His mind is wanderin ' , ai n't it ? " Hannah laid the bowl down and sat beside Samuel . " Yes . " She picked up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlessly , wishing , somehow , to comfort him , to ease this ancient grief , this long guilt he had suffered because his man 's wandering ways had laid too big a burden on a woman . Hannah tried to find the words to say , but they would not come . She felt only the dumb wish to say them , not knowing what they could be , not able to find them . She sat , rubbing his hand , listening , remembering , as his voice droned on . " I never thought you 'd take it so hard , Ann . I never thought you 'd grieve so . Cai n't you put it out of yer mind , an ' learn to like here ? " She remembered her mother , a big woman like herself , a big , plain woman , but lacking the hard strength which Samuel had bestowed on Hannah . She remembered the black hair , so like her own , the dark sallow face , the ways she had about the house . She had been clean , neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bed she had never let her work go . She had been a master hand at weaving , and she had taught Hannah well . But she had been a sad woman , never talking much , rarely laughing . Occasionally she had sung to Hannah , one song , always the same song , and never all of it . Hannah could hear the high , quavering voice now . " 0 , sister , O sister , let 's we walk out . . . To see the ships asailin ' about . . . Bow down , bow down . . . I will be true , true to my love , an ' he will be true to me . . . . " " Go on , Ma , " Hannah had pleaded , when the voice had broken off . But Ann had always answered the same . " I have forgot the rest . " Hannah used to wonder , and did again now , did she , maybe , have a sister she yearned for ? A dear sister left behind ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside the sea ? Or maybe a true love , before Samuel , lost in the sea ? She never knew . But now that Samuel was revealing so much , Hannah remembered how her mother had stood so often in the doorway , looking southward . . . stood there and looked and looked , not speaking or even weeping , just looking . As young as she had been , Hannah had sensed that at such times her mother was not aware of her or even of the surroundings , and , as children will , she had often stirred restlessly to call attention to herself and to bring her mother back . If Samuel had appeared suddenly , Ann had been wont to leave off her looking brusquely , busying herself immediately with some task . Sitting beside him now , listening , Hannah tried to recall if she had ever heard her mother complain , and she could not remember having ever done so . All her complaining had been done inside her , in her heart , which Samuel must have known . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailment , have laid forever upon him an uneasy knowledge of his own part in her sadness and in her death . For what Samuel was revealing in his delirium was that what had been to Hannah a safe and beloved home had been to her mother a strange and terrible place , no home at all , a place to which  | she had never become reconciled , and from which she was always turning and fleeing southward to the place from whence she had come . A great sadness settled upon Hannah that it should have been so , and a treat wonder . Being part of them both , she could understand her mother 's sternal longing , and at the same time she could feel amazement , as Samuel must have done , that she could not put aside her longing and let the new borne take its hold upon her . A man 's ways , Hannah thought , are his own , an ' it 's a woman 's place to foller after , an ' to do fer him . Thus she defended Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother had done exactly that  --  she had followed after and she had done for him . It must be , Hannah thought wonderingly , that to some it is given to follow gladly , and to some the gift is withheld , and then the most willing following must be done with inner sickness . Samuel jerked his hand away and began thrashing about upon the pallet . She reached out to quiet him , thinking he would hurt his leg with his turning and stirring . Her hand brushed his face . The heat of it startled her . She felt his forehead , and it was hot , with a dry papery feeling , as if it would crackle and split under her touch . Even as her hand lay on his forehead he jerked away , sat suddenly bolt upright and began to struggle and to curse wildly , yelling that the redskins had him , that he 'd been took while he was asleep , tome upon unawares , that he had to get away , get loose and free . Tice was beside Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " an ' hold on to his shoulders . " In the strength of delirium and wild with fear Samuel threw himself against their hands , struggling , fighting , screaming out at them and cursing them , " Leave go , you redskin varmints ! Leave go ! You 'll not take Samuel Moore alive ! I 'll not be took an ' roasted on a spit . You c'n sink that hatchet in my skull if you 're a mind to , but I 'll not be took alive ! Leave go , I tell you ! " It took all the strength of both Tice and Hannah to hold him as he threw himself about on the pallet , not aware at all of his hurt leg , reckless with it and feeling , apparently , no pain from it . Then abruptly his nightmare of Indians was over . He slumped in their arms and lay back down . He continued , however , to moan and to turn restlessly from side to side . " He 's burnt up with fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on account of it . " Tice knelt beside her . " Reckon I ort to tie him somehow ? " " I 'd ruther not . If we c'n make out to hold on to him , I 'd ruther not to tie him up . " " He 's liable to hurt his leg , Hannah . " " I do n't see how he c'n do any great hurt to it . . . not more'n he 's done already . " Samuel began to talk again and to thrash about . He was poling the raft up the river , now , fretting . " We got to git acrost to yon side , Hannah . Hit 's gittin ' too shaller here . I got to pole over . You stiddy the things whilst I angle us over . Jist sit stiddy , Hannah , we c'n make it . " He was blowing , panting with the effort . Then he cried out in sudden alarm , " Hannah ! You 're a tippin ' the raft ! I said set stiddy ! Goddlemighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And  | then , thinking the raft had overturned , he was floundering in the water , struggling , clutching Tice , yelling at Hannah , " Git to the bank ! Git to the bank fast afore yer skirts drag you down ! Git on , I 'll see to the things . I 'll see to the raft . I got ahold of it , you git on to the bank . " He was quiet again , moaning . . . " The water is too deep . Hit 's draggin ' me under , Hannah . Hit 's closin ' over me . Help me , Hannah . . . help me outen the water . " Hannah knelt at his feet , holding them as best she could , her head bent and her shoulders huddled . Tice heard her say , once , " I 'm helpin ' you , Pa , all I kin . I 'm doin ' all I kin do fer you . " And after that she said no more . She looked up quickly when a sudden movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , frowned , and then bent her head again . Finally Samuel was still and quiet , moaning only a little and turning his head from time to time . Tice and Hannah relaxed their holds , eased their knees but continued to watch cautiously . " How long you reckon he 's liable to be like this ? " Hannah asked . Daylight had come now and she could see Tice shake his head . " I d'know , " he said . " I 've seed ' em go on thisaway fer hours . . . sometimes fer a whole day , an ' more . " But Samuel had spent his last strength . He was feeling pain in his leg again , but he did no more than whimper and twitch his big shoulders and roll his head from side to side . He died thus , hard , as he had lived , and without recovering consciousness . There was no peaceful drawing of a last breath as Hannah had watched her mother do . There was instead a buckling of the chest , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong on two legs once more , and a collapse , a twitch or two , and then stillness . Hannah breathed in deeply , as if within her own lungs she would take enough air for Samuel too , held the breath without knowing she was doing it , then let it go in a long sigh . " He 's gone , " she said . Tice said nothing . He turned around , picked up the blanket in which he had been rolled , laid it over Samuel , drawing it up over his face . Hannah watched him , and when it was done she braced one hand on the ground and pushed herself slowly up . She stood a moment , looking down at the blanketcovered figure , her hands hanging limply , then she lifted her head , pushed her hair back and slowly walked out from under the roof of the cave . The sun was rising and the whole eastern sky was alight . Down in the woods the birds were noisy with a kind of wild joy , twittering , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . A clear , pearly light lay over the meadow , extending to the far line of the hills and thrusting them boldly into the glow of morning . When Tice moved up beside her and laid his hand on her shoulder she winced , as if any touch , now , was unwelcome , but she gave no other sign and he did not remove his hand . " If they was e'er other thing , Hannah , " he said gently , " you could of done fer him , I do n't know of it . You done all a body could of done , an ' more than most . Hit 's a comfort to know that , I 'd reckon . " She made no answer  --  continued simply to look across the meadow , south , toward the hills . " Hit 's a pity , " she sighed , finally .  | " Hit is a pity , " Tice said . " Hit 's a pity , " she went on , as if he had not spoken , " he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day . Together they dug the grave , Tice softening the earth with the axe , Hannah scooping it out with a makeshift shovel of bark and with the iron pot . Tice had not wanted her to help . He was uncomfortable about it , something within him rebelling . He had never known of a woman helping to dig a grave . " You need n't to help , " he said . " I 'd ruther to , " she 'd said . " I 'd ruther to do what I kin . " Tice forbore to argue with her . It was a man 's work and it did n't appear seemly to him for a woman to be helping , but then she was n't like any other woman , anyhow , this one  --  not like any he 'd ever known . He reckoned that being raised by a man , alone with him all her days , she 'd taken on more of a man 's ways than a woman 's . Let her help dig the grave , then . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one to shame her . He looked at her from time to time as she worked beside him . She had not given way to tears at all , but that she was grieving was plain to see . Her jaw was set and her eyes looked sunken in her head . Her face was tired looking and white , and her mouth was tightly crimped . She would be the kind , he thought , who never gave way to weeping , not hardly knowing how . She would always hold her grief tight inside of her , not even wishing the comfort of tears , but hurting hard with a kind of knotted hurt that would n't come loose . He wished she would cry and be eased of it , but he did n't expect her to . When the grave was dug she looked about as if searching for something . " What are you seekin ' out ? " Tice asked . " Some green branches to line the grave with . He was used to layin ' out , an ' he 'll lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of branches under him . " At the last , Samuel laid upon the green branches , she smoothed his hair as best she could , ordered his limbs and folded his hands . She did only one thing that betrayed her feeling . Lifting the hands to fold them over his chest , she held them a moment , rubbing the dry wrinkled skin between her palms , then she raised them to her face and laid her cheek against them for a second ? no more than that , and a spasm of pain crossed her face . Then she put them in place and stepped back from the grave . She cut more of the green branches and laid them over him , and then , herself , picked up a handful of the loose dirt and scattered it over him . Tice raked with the axe head and Hannah shoveled with the bark scoop and soon the grave was filled . That done , Hannah knelt and smoothed it over . " I hate to say it , " Tice told her , seeing what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks over it an ' limbs . . . hide it so 's the redskins wo n't find it an ' haul him out , or the wolves or some wild animal . " Hannah looked up at him , and then , understanding , she nodded and gave over smoothing out the surface . She helped him find stones to heap over it until finally it was all done . The sun was just setting . She dusted her hands on her skirt and brushed back her hair . Tice watched her . He did n't think  | she ever knew she did it . Her hair would n't stay in place and a hundred times a day she brushed it back . Sometimes she stopped and repinned it , but mostly she did n't  --  just slicked at it with the back of her hand to get it out of her eyes . " You 'll be ready to eat , I reckon , " she said to him . " Not so 's you could tell it . I ai n't got much appetite . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then recalling herself , lifted her shoulders as if they ached . " No , But a body 's got to eat . I 'll fix us a bait . " She built the fire , mixed the bread , set meat to roasting . She went about the work with the same quiet efficiency she always showed , not muddling things , not dropping and stumbling . She reached , mixed , fixed , with the slow steadiness Tice had already learned was characteristic of her . He watched her and wondered what she was thinking . She was thinking nothing at all . She was finding , in the busyness of her hands , in their familiar motions at familiar tasks , a respite from both thinking and feeling . She was thinking , if it could be called thinking , of carrying water from the spring , of setting the iron pot on the fire , of putting a pinch of salt in the meal , or whittling sticks for the meat . With routine she was patching the cracks of her sundered world , piecing it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietest , most certain way in the world to give it a little meaning again . With routine she was snatching from death , for a little while , the victory . These things were real , the iron pot , the water , the meal and the meat . These things had to do with life . Samuel was gone . But life still went on . There were things to do . When they had eaten their meal Tice spoke of plans . " You have thought of what you aim to do , have you ? " Hannah had finished ordering the clutter of making their supper and was sitting across the ashes of the fire , leaning against the solid rock that formed the back of the rockhouse . " Yes , " she said . He waited for her to continue . When she did not , he asked , " You aimin ' to go on , or you want to turn back ? " " 1 aim to go on . " " I c'n take you to the Falls an ' likely some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you till you could travel back up to Fort Pitt . Somebody 'd be goin ' afore the summer 's over , I 'd reckon . " " No . " " Is they folks back there where you comp from would want you ? " She turned her face toward him and looked at him quietly . " I have got no folks , " she said , " that I know of , nowhere . Pa was all of the folks I had . " Tice was silent , thinking it over . " Well , " he said , then , " is it in yore mind to go where yer pa was headed ? Boone 's fort ? " " I 've got no particular wish to go there . Pa had picked it , but I do n't know as it makes any difference now . I 'd be amongst strangers there same as e'er other place . " " Would you jist as soon go to Logan 's then ? " She dipped her head and plucked at her skirt . " I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was thinking , that at least she would know him at that place . Coming and going there would be one she could lay eyes on she 'd seen before , one she 'd had speech with , and knew something of his ways . Oh , she thought , in the midst of strangers it would be a comforting thing to have one not strange ! " If I c'n have my pick , " she went on , her words not stressed by any emotion , " hit would be Logan 's , I reckon . I would n't aim , though , " she said , suddenly raising her head and with a motion of her hands emphasizing her words , " I would n't aim to be a burden to nobody . " Tice laughed at her . " A burden ? Nobody that c'n do a day 's work is a burden in a fort . Ben Logan 's woman , Ann , will give you a welcome with open arms , she 'll be so proud to have another hand to help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fort  --  folks comin ' an ' goin ' , all of ' em stakin ' out claims an ' tempery to git out onto ' em an ' git started . They come in an ' take shelter a few months , then they 're gone till they 's a skeer . The ones that stays there all the time has to carry the most of the load . Ones like Ben an ' Ann Logan . Oh , do n't ever think it , you 'll be a burden . They 'll be a plenty of things fer you to do . " " I 'd hope fer it . " " You c'n do more than hope . You c'n put it down as sart'n . " She wondered that he did not mention his own woman to welcome her . Maybe she was the kind did n't take to strangers and knowing it he could n't say , as she 'd half expected him to , " You c'n stay with me an ' mine . " He was talking again . " Hit would suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hit would suit . " He had thought it . She was n't one to dawdle , and it would be in her mind , he knew , that nothing could be gained by lingering beside Samuel 's new grave . " We 'll stir soon , then , an ' git a early start . " " Yes . " Hannah lay that night on Samuel 's bed , and Tice rolled in a blanket near the fire .  | WHEN IT CAME to dividing the load the next morning , Tice took the two guns , his own and Samuel 's , and the axe , and he rolled the powder and lead into his blanket . Hannah carried her own gun and the iron pot and pewter spoons . Into her blanket she rolled the bag of necessaries and what was left of the meal and salt , not forgetting the clothing and bundle of seeds , which last she stuffed down into the iron pot . Tice looked uncertainly at the spinning wheel . " I reckon you set a heap of store by that there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be needin ' it in time . " " I do n't see e'er way we c'n take it , though , Hannah . We 're loaded past easy packin ' now . " " I done figured that out . I know we cai n't pack it now . I aimed to hide it here an ' come back fer it when I kin . " She set it back under the rock ledge in the farthest , darkest corner and heaped branches over it . Tice helped , approvingly . " I 'll git it fer you the first time I 'm up this way a horseback , an ' it wo n't be long , neither . Two , three weeks at the most . I 'll git it fer you , I give my word . " " You need n't to weary about it . I likely wo n't need it fer a right smart time . Jist anytime you got the room an ' passin ' . An ' if it proves unhandy , I c'n come myself . I 'd figure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . I 'll git it fer you , like I said . " Tice looked at her feet when they had finished screening the spinning wheel . " You got any footgear ? The goin ' gits rough in places . " Without argument Hannah opened her bundle , took out a pair of moccasins and tied them on . She knew herself her feet were yet too tender for traipsing . She was ashamed that she had needed reminding . I 'd ort to thought , she told herself . He 'll be thinkin ' I 'm plumb dozy ; Tice glanced around to see if they had forgotten anything . The rockhouse , save for the hidden spinning wheel , was as clean as when they had arrived . He nodded his satisfaction . " Now , " he said to Hannah , " if I git to goin ' too hard fer you , jist sing out . I 'm used to makin ' time . " " I c'n keep up . " " I do n't think but what you kin , commonly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hit mought wear you sooner'n you 'd think . You mind , now , an ' call out . " She promised and swung the blanket-wrapped load across her shoulders .  | " Tice stepped back of her to settle it evenly . Standing there , she could see the small , rough pile of rocks which marked Samuel 's grave . If a body did n't know , she thought , they 'd never guess it was a grave there . They 'd just think it was a little small scattering of rocks had got riffled up together somehow . They 'd not know at all there was Samuel Moore down in under the rocks and the dirt . The remembrance of him , dead , who had been so much alive , came into her mind , and such a pain at this ending of a man 's life shot through her , unexpectedly and suddenly , that she swayed on her feet . It was more than a mortal could reason out , she thought , achingly  --  the way of things . A body was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not asking to be birthed , nor knowing or remembering it . With nothing to do with it but to draw breath and eat and sleep , you come into the world and commence to live . And then you lived out your span  --  you grew up and you learned things , and you married and had young ones of your own , and you hunted or you kept the care of a house , and some things you laughed at and some things made you weep . You liked some folks and you misliked others . You journeyed and you stayed at home . You watched the sun rise and set , and the seasons in passing . You made out , this way or that , some folks better than others , but all in their own way making out to live . When your time came , like the last spark of fire put out , you died . And there was a little mound of dirt to show you 'd ever drawn a breath . Why ? Why did you ever ? What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mortal 's reasoning to know . All you could do , she thought , was keep on making out , this way or that . Tice had shouldered his load now . He glanced at Hannah , saw she was looking at the grave , and waited . He reckoned that somewhere inside of her she was telling her goodbye to Samuel . If I just did n't have to leave him here in this wilderness , she was thinking , in this new , strange country . He was gone and he would never know , but it would n't hurt so bad , she thought , if she could just leave him some place that was known to him in his lifetime . By her mother , maybe , close to home , or even in the woods he 'd hunted and traipsed over , or by the branch back of the house . She felt as if she were forsaking him , leaving him here alone . He seemed to be lying so lonely and strange , and to be lonesome and strange , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no words came . Seeing , Tice moved nearer . " Hannah , " he said , " this is a easy place to find . I lit ai n't as if you had to leave him in some woodsy place lookin ' like ever ' other woodsy place in the country . This here place is kind of marked . E'er time you 're of a mind to come , it c'n be found as easy as the river . " She came back out of the fog of hurt and pain and looked at him . It was as if he had known how her thinking was going . He could n't have found better words to say , and a wave of relief surged through her . " Why , hit 's so , ai n't it ? This here rockhouse is like a cabin place . Hit would be easy to find . An ' Pa is restin ' close to the last house he lived in , ai n't he ? In a way he is , you could say . We have cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strangeness off , an ' he ai n't restin ' in a fur off unknown place at all . "  | " No . " He did n't hurry her , but she saw that he was loaded . It came over her that he had been waiting . She picked up her gun . " I never aimed to belate you . I am ready now . " " You sure , are you ? " " I 'm sure . " Tice had eased the leaving for her . " Do n't fergit to sing out if I git to goin ' too fast fer you . " " I 'll not . " He swung off ahead of her down the slope . Without looking back again she followed . The sun was just coming up and the whole sky was flushed with a warm , rosy light . It lay over the meadow and beneath it the grass was silver with a heavy dew  --  frosted with it , iced with it , bent and sparkled with it . They walked down the slope from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah was glad , now , to be journeying again . The country was spread wide before her eyes and she could see the lay of it , the curve and sweep and rise and swell of it . She could get the feel of it and the smell of it . She fixed the distance between herself and Tice , regulated her step to it and kept it there , comfortably near but not crowding . After that she could give her mind over to looking and seeing . The meadow was wider than she had thought . It took them until the middle of the afternoon to reach the hills , a time of steady going . Hannah did not ask for rest . Samuel had taught her long ago that it was worse to rest frequently than to keep going . " When you feel yer legs givin ' out on you , " he 'd told her when she yet reached no higher than his waist , " slow up a mite , mebbe , but keep goin ' . Hit 'll pass . You git yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you c'n keep goin ' all day . " He 'd pushed her to show her , tried her and tested her , and she had found it was true . Inevitably that first weariness and desire for rest came . If you gave in to it , a day 's going was ruined . You 'd have to rest every hour , likely . If you put it aside , kept going , in time you got stronger , the weariness passed , and you got into what was your real stride , tireless , easy and steady . When they camped that night in the hills , she was tired , but she was not worn out . Tice said they would bait cold . " We had to risk a fire before , " he told Hannah , " what with Samuel needin ' his vittles hot , an ' his leg tended , but that cave was kind of hid away . They 's no call to now , an ' I 'd ruther not to take the chance . " " No , " Hannah agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had done on the bank of the river . All the next day they were in hilly country . At first the hills were low and rounded , but as they penetrated ever farther south they became rougher , higher , knobbier . They were still not solidly about . There were long sweeps  | of meadow between , and beautiful valleys , but increasingly the hills gathered closely . " Is this the startin ' , " Hannah asked , " of the mountains ? " " My sakes , " Tice told her , laughing , " they ai n't no mountains in Kentucky savin ' them in the east you got to cross comin ' into the country , an ' we ai n't that fur over . No , these is jist hills , an ' they ai n't none much worse than these . An ' they 's allus meadowy places between ' em , an ' valleys . Up north on the other side of the river hit 's rollin ' country , an ' they ai n't no hills to speak of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hilly stretches . " Hannah felt a loyalty to the country already . " I 'd ruther to have it that way . " " An ' me . " " Hit 's rougher , though , on the Hanging Fork where you got yore stand , is It ? " " Some , " he admitted . " But like I said , they 's meadowy places all over . My own place , now , it has got as purty a meadow as a body could ever hope to see . An ' the game is plentier thereabouts . Not many has settled there yit , an ' it 's not been skeered an ' kilt off . " Knowing how much simpler that made a man 's job Hannah nodded soberly . " Hit is a thing to consider . " " You take , now , " Tice went on , " if a man do n't have to git out fur to kill his meat , he c'n put in a heap more time on his place . Not , " he added , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time the way things is right now . But in time , when we git more settled an ' the Indians is quietened , it 'll be handy . " " You think they ever will be ? The Indians ? " Tice looked at her quickly . " I think it . . . in time , that is . Ben Logan says that when we git enough men to make a march into the Indian country an ' commence burnin ' their towns fer a change , an ' plunderin ' them the way they 've done us , they 'll not be so ready to lay siege to us . In my opinion , that 'll be the way of it . " Hannah thought about it . " When , " she asked , then , " are they aimin ' to make sich a march ? " " Oh , it 's untellin ' . But the way folks is comin ' , it wo n't be long . Mebbe next year , even . The next , fer sart'n . The settlements is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Logan 's has went out an ' built their own stockades , an ' folks is already streamin ' acrost the Gap an ' summer barely started . Ben Logan says it would n't astonish him e'er bit if we could n't muster five hundred men afore the year is over . Folks is commencin ' to come from all sides , like you'uns down the river , an ' as many as thirty , forty at a time , travelin ' together , over Boone 's Trail . Hit wo n't be long , I c'n tell you . " " I reckon Pa war n't the only one itchin ' to git into the country , then . " " Not by a long sight , he war n't . " They traveled from first light until dark , Tice knowing each day the place he wished them to reach to lay over the night . Rarely did the land lie level . Even in the valleys and meadows there was a roll and swell to it that kept one pulling uphill and then bracing downhill . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he could , Tice kept to the valleys , skirting the hills , but occasionally a range of them lay across the trail so that there was nothing to do but make their way over . One day they traveled for hours in a wide park of giant trees whose floor lay as level as a puncheon in a house . The tall , towering trees were widely spaced so that two or three riding horseback could have passed together . The trees were noisy with a brilliant , chattering bird  --  a bird that was green and gold and plumed sometimes with blue . Hannah asked about it . " That 's a parakeet , " Tice told her , " ai n't they the noisiest ones you ever heared ? " " I d'know but they are , " she admitted , " but they 're awful purty , too . " The floor of the forest was thickly bedded with old leaves , but there was no undergrowth . Softly they paced through , scarcely a whisper of sound coming from their feet . Overhead the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scattered widely . Hannah took note of the trees . She made out ash and beech , walnut and gum , sugar trees and the broadest and girthiest of trees , the oak , and when they came out of the forest into the hills again she missed their tall stateliness . The hills were covered over with trees , true , but they were nowhere near as handsome or as tall . Even in the hills , Hannah reckoned they covered about fifteen miles each day . She did not think she had slowed Tice much . He told her she had not . " You have done good , " he told her , when they stopped at the end of the fourth day . " I do n't know as a man could of done better . " " He likely could , " she demurred modestly . " Pa could , I think . " " No , I do n't think it , " Tice insisted . " Him an ' me , now , not packin ' nothin ' , we mought of made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know as we could . " Hannah did not tell him that without a load she had always paced Samuel , never asking or being given quarter . She would n't have worried about slowing Tice without a load . She would have known she could keep up . But she had been uncertain with the load . She let his statement stand , however . " I 'd not want to slow you down none . You 've done give up enough of yer time , the way it is . " " You 've not slowed me none , " he assured her again , " you 've done good . Yer feet bothered you any ? " " Some , " she admitted . " They ai n't cut up none , though , " she added quickly , " fist sore . " " Hit takes a while fer ' em to toughen , " Tice agreed , reasonably . " Now the way of it is , Hannah , we c'n either head in fer Harrodstown tomorrow an ' lay over there , or we c'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrodstown , you could rest easy fer the night an ' eat good afore we started on again . Somethin ' hot mought taste purty good to you . " " Does Harrodstown lay right in the path ? " " Well , no . We 're a mite west of Harrod 's fort . Here , " he said , " I 'll show you the way of it . " He picked up a twig and squatted near her , rubbed a smooth place in the dirt and began to draw . " This here is about where we are at , now . Jist about level with Harrodstown . Mebbe four , five mile north yit . We c'n easy cut  | over there , though , an ' take the night . Hit would n't be much outen the way . " " Where at is Logan 's fort ? " " Down here . " He made a mark . " We 're on a due line with it . " " Is they e'er reason you 'd wish to lay over at Harrod 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left up to you , you 'd head straight on fer Logan 's , would you ? " " If , " Tice said , stressing the word , " I 'd been by myself the whole time , I d'know but what I would . But it mought jist come in my mind to stop an ' pass the time with the folks at Harrod 's . A man do n't rightly know what he 'll take a notion to do . Till the time comes , that is . He mought , one time he 's out , he of a notion to head straight as the crow flies fer where he 's goin ' , without no stoppin ' off an ' visitin ' . Again , he mought be struck with the notion of stoppin ' an ' visitin ' . Jist depends , I 'd say . " Hannah nodded . Samuel had been the same way . Often he had come home and said , " I jist taken a notion to go round the other side the mountain . Hit seemed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he would dress in the morning , stand in the doorway and eye the sun and turn quickly to say , " I 've a notion to take a sashay over to the village this mornin ' . If they 's e'er tradin ' you want done you c'n be thinkin ' on it whilst I do up the work . " She knew about a man 's notions and how they were guided by his wants and humor . " But , " Tice went on , " seein ' as I ai n't been by myself , an ' we are headin ' icr Logan 's , I d'know but I 'd as soon keep straight on . If you would , that is , an ' If you ai n't too fashed out . " " Oh , I ai n't , " she said quickly , " why I could go on easy , an ' I 'd jist as soon . " " Then that 's what we 'll do , " Tice said , throwing the twig away , " though Il 'll mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not bother me none . " " No , I do n't reckon it will . " Hannah was glad they were to pass Harrod 's fort by . She dreaded coming to the end of this journey , now that it was in sight  --  dreaded coming , finally , to a settlement where there were people . If they passed Harrod 's fort by there would be at least one more day before she need face up to it . During the long days , following Tice , in the long silences of the hours , she had thought about what lay before her . She had thought of what Tice had said about Ann Logan needing help in her cabin inside the fort , and she had tried to picture herself there . She had called up to mind the tasks that would fall to her , the milking , maybe , and tending the milk , helping with the cooking , and redding up , helping , maybe , with the younguns . The work , she told herself , would come easy to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way , and not mind . She did n't recall that work had ever tired her or bothered or fretted her . But she shrank from the knowledge of living with , close to , near , people  --  being shut up in a town . I d'know as I c'n do it , she thought , and her feeling about it was a kind of anguished helplessness . But I d'know as they 's e'er other thing fer me to do . If Samuel had lived , now , he would n't have stayed in a fort any longer than  | it took to get some kind of a place started . He 'd have taken them out of the town in no time at all . That was what he 'd planned , and what he 'd wanted , and it was what she wanted , too . She did n't know how she could make out to do differently . She thought about it , turned it over and over in her mind . She had n't ever counted on coming out at this place , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could , alone , go ahead with the kind of plan Samuel had made . On the last day before they reached Logan 's fort , she thought of it and she closed up the distance to Tice . " Is they e'er woman took out a claim for herself ? " " In her own name , you mean ? An ' worked it by herself without a man ? " " Yes . " He shook his head . " I do n't know of e'er one . " He puzzled over it a minute or two . " No , I do n't know of a one . I d'know as they could n't , mind you . Not in law , that is . I d'know the law of it . But even if the law said you could , hit would n't hardly be a thing a woman could do . You got to raise a crop , an ' you got to build some kind of a place on the land , an ' you got to live on it a spell . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without no man to help . " " I could , " Hannah said , simply . Tice looked at her . He saw the long frame of her body , the wide , strong shoulders carrying , now , a load almost as heavy as his own , and carrying it as easily as he . He saw the strong , big hands carrying the gun . From what he knew of her , and he had learned a lot , he judged that in most things commonly called a man 's work she was as clever as any man . He watched her walking beside him , her stride as long and as effortless as his own , as used to the woods as his own , and he said , drily , " I d'know but you could , " and then he laughed , " but my sakes , Hannah , they ai n't no need you doin ' that , even if the law 'd allow it . No need at all . You 'll have yore pick of men to marry afore you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind to git out onto a stand of yer own , what you 'd best do , in my opinion , is jist make yer choice of the men that 'll be beggin ' you . Hit goes a heap easier that way . They 's sich a rush as you never seen fer ever ' single woman or widder that comes into the settlements . They ai n't no woman has to make out by her lone self , without that 's jist her own wish . " Hannah pondered his remarks . " Hit could be it would be the best , " she said finally . But she did n't say what she thought about it , because she did n't know what she thought about it . Getting married was an idea entirely new to her . She would have to think about it some before she knew whether that was what she wanted or not . She 'd have to see about it .  | THEY MADE a very long march the last day . They had had good weather the whole journey  --  long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they got up that morning to a drizzling mist which dribbled down out of a whitegray sky that had lidded over the tops of the hills . They were camped on top of a hill , near the rim where it broke into a rough hollow , and the hollow was filled with the misty drizzle , and the stretch of valley below disappeared in a gray , shifting fog . Beyond the valley there was nothing but the wall of gray . Tice shivered as they shouldered their packs . " Hit 's like the time had got itself mixed up an ' it was November , ' stid of May , ai n't it ? " Hannah was untroubled by the weather . " Oh , they 's days thisaway . Bound to be , ' fore spring c'n git itself settled in . " Tice grunted , settling the pack to his shoulders . " Now , we can , " he said , " make it plumb in to the fort by night , or soon after , if we keep goin ' today . Hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible . Hit 's jist up to you , though , " he added quickly . Hannah could have laughed he was so poor at hiding his own wish . He 'd been kind and patient , overly patient to help her out , but now that they were so near the fort he was like a horse headed for home . Likely he had a wish to get there as quick as he could  --  to the ones waiting for him . . . his woman and kids . " How fur do you make it ? " she asked . He appeared to be studying , though she guessed he knew within a quarter of a mile exactly how far it was . " Hit 's too fur , " he said finally . " Hit 's a mite better'n twenty-five mile . " Hopefully he looked at her . She picked up her gun . " We c'n try . " He grinned at her . " I was hopin ' you 'd see it that way . " She grinned back at him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . . . we 'll stop if you say so , an ' I 'd ruther you to say if you git too wore out . " " I 'll say so , " she promised , knowing he had said it to be polite , and she 'd promised to match his courtesy . They 'd go to the fort today , unless they came to disaster in some unforeseen way . The going was no rougher than it had been , but the mist made the ground slippery in places so that footing was more uncertain and Hannah knew the miles were going to wear on them sooner . All morning they traveled in the hazy drizzle . " You cai n't see , " Tice told her , once , " but off there to the west  | is all hills now . Jist one after another like they 'd been shook out of a box an ' let lie where they fell . " He named off the biggest creeks as they came to them . " This is Knob Lick . " And later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper 's Branch . Dave Cooper fell into it one time with a full load of baled skins . Like to drownded hisself ' fore he could git loose from ' em . That 's how come the branch to git its name . " Still later , crossing a wider stream he said , " This here is the Hanging Fork . " Hannah looked at its clear , lazy-flowing water . " Is yore place close ? " " Not very . Hit 's about ten mile upstream . " Hannah pondered on the name of the stream , thinking how Cooper 's Branch had come to be called so . " How come this creek to be the Hanging Fork ? " she said . " I d'know as I know , exactly . Some says a coupla fellers was hung on it some place . They 'd run afoul of the law , an ' when they was caught up with they give the men had caught ' em rich a pesky time they jist got wore out with it an ' hung ' em to git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of it , though . Hit 's been told , is all . Rightly , it 's the Hanging Fork of Dick 's River . Rises down close to where I got my stand , an ' angles northeast-like an ' runs into the Dick 's River . " He started chuckling . " Now , they 's a story to the way that river got its name . Dave Cooper told me , an ' he was along at the time , so I reckon he knows . He was in this country about ten year ago with a bunch of hunters an ' they got friendly with a old Cherokee chief . Could n't none of ' em say his real name so they jist called him Cap'n Dick , an ' he was the proudest of that name . Liked it better'n his Indian name an ' got in the way of callin ' hisself by it . Well , one time they was trappin ' an ' huntin ' down along the river an ' he come up on ' em . He must of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't much like them huntin ' there . He told ' em that was his river . . . hit was Dick 's River , an ' they ortent to be huntin ' on it . He told ' em they could go ahead , though , since they 'd got started but when they got through to go home an ' not to come back , fer he did n't want none of ' em stayin ' on there . That was the way it got started bein ' called the Dick 's River . " Hannah laughed appreciatively and said , " Well , I vow , " and then she asked , " Did they go home ? " " Well . . . fer the time bein ' they did . But they come back , as you c'n see . Him an ' all the others come back , in time . " Hannah thought about the old Indian , and how he must have known even then what would happen to the country if the white men came into it and built their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt a little pity for him , but then , how else was a country to be settled ? Ways had to change . There was plenty of room for the Indians in other places , if they 'd only pick up and go . There was n't anything making them stay on , after the white men came . It did n't occur to her that the white men would always follow . There was only the present for her , the need , right now , to settle this particular country . Pity gave way to the impatience all the settlers felt with the Indians . Indians would n't live in this Kentucky country and make use of it , and they would n't  | go away and leave the white men in peace . It was a wide , big country , and the Indians had only to move over a little . Along about the middle of the afternoon the drizzle let up and the sun shone out palely through the gray sky . It was a sallow light , but it slowly ate away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time that day Hannah could see farther than a quarter of a mile in any direction . It astonished her how this country could change in half a day 's travel . You moved from meadows to hills , to valleys , to forested parks , back to hills . Only one thing about it was certain . You would never for very long be on a level place . The one distinctive thing about it was its billow and roll . High in the sky there was still a haze over the sun and its light was pale as if strained through gauze . They slowly climbed a slope so long that it seemed not a hill at all but rather the slant of some gently tilted globe . When they finally reached the top , however , and began the descent on the other side Tice pointed ahead . " Hit ai n't too fur now . " He struck a faster pace , then , and Hannah grimly set herself to keep up . He was bound to get there , she thought , and she determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dark when they reached the fort . They had come up a long hill , wooded thickly , and had come across its top into the edge of the clearing . " ' here it is , " Tice called out to Hannah , stopping and pointing . The fort topped a rise in the middle of the clearing , looming darkly and overlooking a long , sweeping valley which lay between the hills . Hannah looked at it . She had thought she would dread this moment , but she was so tired that what she actually felt was relief they had finally reached it . Tice had set a hard pace , and she had been pushed to keep up . She was tireder than she remembered being for a long , long time . Her feet were sore , her legs ached , her back hurt , and as she stood she felt her knees trembly and weak , as if they were going to give way beneath her . Tice explained to her , " Ben had us to clean all the woods away fer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight around the fort . He did n't want no redskins creepin ' right up to the gate unbeknownst to us . They come near doin ' that once , last summer , an ' he vowed then they would n't be a tree left fer ' em to hide behind within rifle shot of the stockade . Oh , it 's a stout fort . The best of ' em , in my opinion . Why , you ort to see what passes fer a fort at Boone 's an ' Harrod 's . They ai n't half as stout as Ben 's , but what Ben Logan sets his hand to is done the right way , an ' you c'n put yer dependence in it . " The fort was oblong in shape , being a third again as long as it was wide , and the strong , sharpened poles of the stockade fence looked invincible to Hannah . Blockhouses overhung the fence at two corners . Fort Pitt , she remembered , was built that same way , only it was bigger . Some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitt . She had felt strange there , oddly exposed and queerly different . She had hardly known herself among so many people . Everything about herself , so long familiar , had gone different , and she had felt as if she had put on a new skin and body , not so reliable as her old ones . She had hated the noise , the busyness , and she had hated the dirt which  | people herded together seemed somehow to accumulate . Her first feeling when the boats had finally slid away down the river had been one of ridding herself of something unclean . Some of that feeling of strangeness now crept back over her . But all she said was , " Hit looks to be stout enough . " " Oh , it is . " They crossed the meadow which lay at the foot of the knoll on which the fort was built and climbed slowly upward . Someone from the fort saw them and called out , " Who is it ? " " Tice Fowler , " Tice shouted back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and several men clustered about them as they came through . Hannah stood waiting as Tice helped close the gate behind them . She felt uncertain and awkward before the men , and she kept her eyes on the ground . They were gathered about , looking at her , frankly curious . One of them , standing near Tice , grinned and said something which she could not hear . Whatever it was Tice grinned too , looking at her . Her discomfort was so evident that he sobered quickly . " Men , " he said , " this here is Samuel Moore 's girl , Hannah . I run up on her an ' her pa up on the Kentucky a piece . Her pa had got cut with his axe . We doctored an ' tended him the best we could , but he died . I have brung her here . " The men were quick with their sympathy . " Hit 's too bad , ma'am , " they said , first one and then another , and then they told how it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , they 'd heard of it , known of it , seen it happen . They spoke quietly and softly , and Hannah took heart at their speech . She stood among them , her shoulders sagged under the pack , her hands folded on her gun , and waited , listening , accepting without reply their softspoken words . " I 'd best take her over to Ben 's , " Tice said , then . They walked away from the men and behind her Hannah heard their voices , murmuring together , still soft and quiet . She noticed now that the fort was divided into two streets inside the stockade , a row of cabins down the middle . The cabins on the outside rows were built in a solid line , each touching the next . But this row down the middle had space between the cabins  --  not much , but a little , and Tice headed for the cabin at the near end . " Ben lives handy to the gate , " he explained . There was a glow through the window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made , Hannah thought , although smoke was curling from the chimney . They had candles , she thought . And suddenly the thought of seeing a candle burning again seemed very good to her . It had been such a long time since she had pinched out the one that had lit their last morning at home . They came up to the cabin , whose door stood open , and Tice called inside , " Halloo , Ann . . . you here ? " " I 'm here , " a woman answered . " Who is it ? " Hannah listened to the voice . It was pleasant , not scratchy or screechy like some women 's . " Hit 's me . . . Tice Fowler . " " Well , come on in , Tice . I 'm just givin ' the children their supper . Ben 's up at Harrod 's . We 'd nearly given you up , you 've been gone such a time . " They stepped inside the door onto a floor  --  a clean puncheon floor , Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took in the rest of the room . . . the laid in one corner , covered with a woven spread , a chest against a wall , a dish cupboard against another , stools sitting about and pots hanging handy by the chimney , the ladder going up to the loft room in the chimney corner , a whiteism rubbed table in the middle of the room , the candle flickering at one end of It . A woman sat at the table with a little boy standing at her knee and a smaller child on her lap . She was feeding the smaller one . She was not actually a handsome woman , Hannah thought . Not really handsome , but she was as pleasant looking as the sound of her voice had been . She was past her first youth , but still young looking , filled out as a woman was alter children came , heavy-busted so that Hannah judged she still nursed the younger child . She wore a plain dress , dyed butternut , as was Hannah 's own , on the dingy side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was crowned with a crisp , snow-white cap . Hannah thought quickly and with a little shame of her own bare head . Her mother had worn a cap , always . She would almost as soon have been caught without her dress as without her cap , and it had been her pride to keep them snowy and freshly ironed . But Hannah had never worn one . Being in the woods so much it would have been in the way . She had n't thought about it , though , to be honest . There had seemed no need to think about it , to decide one way or the other . She could have worn her mother 's caps , she remembered . She had laid them away with the rest of her things . But it had not occurred to her to wear them . And the capped women at Fort Pitt had not made her wish to be like them . Only now , standing before this plain , pleasant woman , in the Olean , fresh house , aware of her woods-bedraggled skirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her creek-slimed moccasins on the clean plank floor ? of her uncombed hair , tousled as it always was when she did n't take care , and Uncapped , she felt shame for her appearance . She felt big and awkward and Unkempt , graceless and ugly . She would have liked to turn around and walk out of the clean house and away from the woman . She moved restlessly . the woman had risen when she saw that Tice was not alone , setting the child in her lap on the floor . Tice began his explanation of Hannah , and Ann Logan listened , her head to one side a little . Before he had finished talking , though , she motioned for him to hush , and walked with a small rush to Hannah . " You take off that pack from your shoulders this very minute , " she said . " The ways of men are beyond me ! To leave you standing with a burden on your shoulders while he talks ! Drop it there on the floor and come here and sit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the eyes to see it ! I 'll bound he 's walked you thirty miles today , just to get here ! " Tice sighed and grinned . " Not but twenty-five , Ann . " Ann Logan wheeled on him . " You ought to be strung up and whipped , Tice Fowler ! " Ile blinked at her , bewildered . " But she was fer comin ' on in , herself , Ann . Hit was her said to . " " Of course she said to , knowing it was what you wanted . What else could she say ! "  | Tice looked at Hannah who was shedding her pack , disencumbering herself . She did look worn out , at that . But she 'd not once complained . How was a man to know ? " She 's stout as a man in the woods , " he murmured . Ann sniffed . " For all she 's strong and stout , and I can see she is with my own eyes , she 's a woman , is n't she ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , Tice Fowler . And just losin ' her pa , too , grievin ' inside of her . You could of thought of those things , seems to me . " Tice looked at her helplessly . " How could I ? ' Thout she said so . " Ann spread her hands in a quick movement of impatience . " Oh , Lord love the breed  --  there is n't a bit of use tryin ' to talk sense to you . Get on out of here and let me tend to her . Is what you 've got there her stuff too ? " " Yes . " " Well , take it off . Drop it alongside her pack there on the floor , and then get on out . " Tice slid the pack onto the floor . " You got room fer her , have you ? " Ann put her hands on her hips and looked at him . " Of course I 've got room for her . What did you think ? " " Well , you could of been full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , thank goodness I 'm not . There 's room and to spare . You go on down to the men 's place , now , and get you something to eat . I 'll take care of this one from here on . " Hannah had dropped onto a stool by the fire and was sitting , her hands folded , drooped a little between her knees , her eyes on the flames . It was a small fire , for there was no need of its heat . It had been built , she knew , to heat up the supper , and would be let die out soon . But she was glad of its cheer . She was n't cold , but a fire was so pleasant a thing in a house . Even traveling , a fire was a comforting thing at night . She 'd missed one these nights . She unfolded her hands and spread them to the brightness . Tice spoke to her . " You 'll be all right now , Hannah . Ann 'll see to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . Ann Logan was a nice woman , and good , likely , but she was a stranger . Tice stood in Samuel 's stead , known to her , his ways and his talk . He was the only one she knew in this strange place , and he was going to leave her here . She had known he was going to have to leave her some place , she reminded herself . It was but what she 'd expected . " Is where you are goin ' to stay fur from here ? " she asked . She thought if he just stayed some place inside the stockade it would be a comfort to her , knowing he was near at hand . But it could be he was going to his own place right away . She felt a feai of what he would say . " Why , no , " he said , wonderingly , " jist down to the blockhouse where the other men stays . " " You ai n't aimin ' to go out to yer own place right away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yit , " he said . " Oh . " He started backing out . " You let me know if they 's e'er thing you need , now . " Ann motioned him away . " Get on out , " and when he had disappeared she  | turned to Hannah . " Right now , first off , I 'm goin ' to fix you some good , hot supper , and I 'm goin ' to heat up some water so you can wash all over when you get through eatin ' . And then you 're goin ' to lay down in a bed for a change and sleep the whole night through . My sakes , you been travelin ' for months . I 'll bound a bed 'll feel good to you . " The two children had sat , the younger one with his thumb in his mouth , eyes round , quietly watching , but as their mother bustled about , dipping up a bowl of stew , breaking off a chunk of bread and crumbling it in , pouring up a noggin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child began noisily and rapidly to eat up his bowl of food . Then he started beating his spoon against the table . " Kin I have some more , Ma ? Kin I ? " " You hush , now , Davey . You can have some more if you 'll not make such a noise about it . " She took the bowl of food she had prepared to Hannah , explaining , " That one is David . The least one is William . " Hannah took the food , looked first at Davey , then at the baby on the floor . She tried to smile at them . " They look to be in good health , " she said finally . She had helped the Williams family on the flatboat with their children . She liked young ones , got along well with them , mostly by leaving them alone . She could find little to say to them , and thought probably there was n't much anybody could say . Mostly it was doing , with young ones , she 'd noticed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first with little relish for the food , and then suddenly with good appetite . From the taste of it , the meat was venison , and the broth was thickened with the crumbled corn pone . It was hot and rich and good . When she had finished Ann took the bowl and without question refilled it . Hannah tried to protest . It was n't good manners to take seconds . But Ann hushed her . " You 're not to stand on manners right now , " she said . " You 've been satin ' cold for several days . You fill yourself up real good . You need it . " While Hannah was eating the second bowl , Ann busied herself with the children , finished feeding the younger one , gave David another half bowl for himself . Then she quickly undressed them and hurried them through a back door into a second room . When she came back Hannah had finished , laid her bowl upon the table and was looking uncertainly about to see how Ann went about washing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ann told her . " That water is hot enough for you to rinse off with . Have you got anything of your own clean enough to change to . . . a clean shift or something , or have you been on the go and no chance to wash ? " Hannah hesitated . She did not have another shift at all . She had used it for Samuel 's bandages . She hated to say so , but then she decided she 'd better not start with Ann by taking pride when she had no call to . She explained . Ann clucked . " Well , there , now . You had n't any choice as I can see it . Of course you had to use your shift on your pa 's leg . I can find you something . " " I 've got a spare dress , " Hannah said , " an ' it 's clean . I ai n't wore it since it was washed . " " You can put it on tomorrow , then , " Ann said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , though , you 'd best have a shift to sleep in. "  | She went to the chest , but before pulling out the drawer she turned and looked at Hannah . " You 're some bigger than I am , and I misdoubt anything of mine 'll fit you . I 'll just run next door to Jane Manifee 's and borrow one of hers . " She moved so swiftly Hannah could hardly keep up with her , not in nervous jerks like some women she 'd seen , but smoothly , as if she always knew exactly what she wanted and where it was . She made up her mind so easily . Now she said , " I 'll just pour up the water for you and lay you out some soft soap and you can commence washing . You need n't to worry , " she said , catching Hannah 's look around , " there 's no menfolks around . Ben 's not to home , and nobody else will come in without warning . Just stay there by the fire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water into a piggin , opening the lower shelf of the cupboard to dip out a bowl of soft soap and handing it out , moving from there to the chest again , drawing out a piece of soft old cloth . " You can dry off with this . I 'll be back in a minute . " Hannah did n't know whether the errand was an excuse to give her the privacy to bathe or not , but she was glad of it . She had n't ever been wholly undressed before another living soul , not clear naked , and she did n't know whether she could have made herself do it or not . With Ann gone she hurried to strip off her dress , and then sighed at the good feeling of the soap and water on her skin . An all-over washing , she thought , was the best thing in the world to take the tiredness out of a person 's bones . Seemed like the heat and the soap and the water just washed the tiredness out , the same way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the water with shame and disgust , there was a plenty of dirt , all right . She had finished before Ann came back , and in her modesty had slipped her dress back on . But she had n't liked to do it . It felt stiff with filth and she hated having to put it on next to her clean skin . She saw no remedy for it , though . And she did n't know what to do with the water . . . where Ann threw her slops . She looked for some container , could n't find one , and decided Ann must empty it out . She would have liked to dash the water out without Ann seeing it , it was so dirty , but not knowing Ann 's ways , whether or not she liked having water dashed on her doorstep , she decided to leave it . She was sitting , taking down her hair , when Ann returned . " Have n't you washed yet ? " she asked , surprised . " Yes , ma'am , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the dress back on . " Oh . Well , here 's a shift for you . It took me longer than I expected . Jane had to ask a heap of questions , and wanted to come over herself and see if she could do anything . But I told her we could make out and you were tired and she 'd best wait until tomorrow . " She picked up the water . " I 'll just empty this out back and you can slip into that shift . Jane 's a big woman and likely it 'll fit you real well . You can just crawl right there in the bed , then . There 's pallets up in the loft room I generally put folks on , but seeing as Ben is n't here right now , you just sleep in the bed with me . " She went through the back room with the bucket of water and while she  | was gone Hannah slipped into the clean shift . Then she did n't know what to do with her dirty dress . She finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Ann had lugged to one corner of the room out of the way . Carefully , then , she turned back the woven coverlid and crawled into the bed , sliding over onto the back side . Taking a big breath , she let it out slowly . The straw mattress crackled under her and she patted it gently . Lordy , but it felt good . She counted back . It had been four months , lacking a few days , since she had slept on a straw tick . She had almost forgotten how soft a bed it was , how a body could slump into it and let go , and any aches or soreness would just kind of ease away . She stretched her full length . It was a long bed . Ann 's man , Ben , must have a good height to him , she thought , to be needing so long a bed . Ann came back into the main room and began setting it in order . Hannah felt guilty and roused up on her elbow . " I 'd ort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' here takin ' my ease , " she said . " I war n't thinkin ' of nothin ' but doin ' as you told me . " " You keep right on thinkin ' that way . . . for tonight at least , " Ann said briskly . " You 've had a rough time of it , and I 'm used to reddin ' up the things . It 'll not take me but a minute . Go on to sleep if you can . " " I 've been a heap of trouble to you . " " My sakes , Hannah , you 'd do the same , would n't you ? If a lone woman , worn out and troubled , came to your house , you 'd do for her , would n't you ? " " Yes , ma'am . " But no lone woman had ever come to their house . Just men , Hannah thought , to take the night with Samuel , and none of them worn out and troubled that she knew of . But , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done what she could . She lay back down and closed her eyes . The room was warm from the fire . Too warm , actually , for Ann went to the door from time to time and fanned it to stir up a breeze . . . but it felt fine to Hannah . She 'd been wading cold creeks , sleeping out on chilly nights , feeling the ground cold beneath her . Now , with her flesh warmed by the bath and the bed , and the warm air of the room on her face , she did n't know that ever fn her life had she felt any better . The flame of the candle flickered now and then , and against her closed eyes she could see the flicker . That , too , was good . She 'd gone to sleep many a time in the bed in the corner of their main room with Samuel and another man or two setting up , talking and talking and talking , their voices kept low so she could sleep , a candle flickering on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , for light at night . Not just a knot of wood , or a piece of rag in bear fat . A candle did n't smoke , and you could sit by its light in peace . And it gave a homey look , more suited to a house . She was sleepy , and her thoughts went straggling off . She hoped Tice had a good bed , which he likely did , seeing he was home again . Something about the thought of Tice troubled her , and she opened her eyes again , puzzling at It . Finally she asked Ann . " Does his woman stay down there at the blockhouse , too ? "  | " Whose woman ? " " Tice 's . " Ann laughed . " Tice is n't married . And there 's no women stay down there . That 's where the men who are n't married stay , or the ones that are here without their women for a while . " " I d'know why , " Hannah said , wonderingly now , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or the other . " Ann stacked the clean bowls in the cupboard . " He 's old enough to be , and past . He never has been , though , that I know of , and I reckon never will be now . " " Do n't he like women ? " Ann pondered a moment . " Well , he 's not woman-shy , like some that never get married . He gets along with any and all of them well enough . He just never seems to need anything more than he 's got . " Hannah nodded . " Pa was like that . . . after my ma died . He never aimed to git married again , though most men would of soon as they could . Pa seemed to like the way things was . " " There are men like that , " Ann agreed , " and there are several of them in this country . . . men used to the woods , not wanting to be tied down . James Harrod was one . . . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heared of him . " " He was past thirty before he married , and David Cooper waited a right smart while , and William Casey , down on the Green , has never got married , nor Silas Harlan , just to name a few that do n't seem to want to . But , oh , there 's plenty that do . " She raised her hand and pointed a soapy finger at Hannah , started laughing , " You just wait till they hear there 's a single woman in the fort ! They 'll come flockin ' about like crows after corn . You wait and see ! " " That 's what Tice said , only I thought mebbe he was pokin ' fun at me . " " No , he was n't pokin ' fun at you . He was meanin ' it . It happens all the time . There 's no woman in this country has to do without a man , unless she 's of a mind to . You can take your pick inside of a week or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbed her feet together under the coverlid in a kind of embarrassed wiggling . Again she did n't know what to say , or what to think . She hoped they would n't come flocking too soon . She hoped she 'd have time to think upon it before they started clustering around . She did n't know as she wanted to get married . She 'd been used to the ways of one man all her life , and she thought it might be pretty hard to get used to another 's . Ann said nothing more and slowly Hannah 's eyes grew heavy again . Slowly her mind turned loose of people and places , of events and time . The last thing she was conscious of was the feeling of warmth , softness , cleanness , and then the velvet blackness of sleep overcame her .  | THE SUN was high in the south and the sky was a bright , light blue . It had a polish like glazed china . Straight overhead some fat white clouds rolled and hunched together in lazy , overlapping billows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down strongly . The heat poured straight into the square of the fort . Ben Logan had left but few trees inside the stockade , and they were small and grouped toward the middle . Standing under one of them , a little walnut , churning , Hannah wondered if the women , maybe , had argued for a little shade where the children could play . It was a nice thing for young ones to have a shady place during the hot time , and they 'd used it , it was plain to see , for the ground was packed flat and hard all about . But with so many folks coming and going , it likely would have been anyhow , she thought , for more feet than children 's stirred constantly up and down the two streets . Hannah stood to churn , although there was a small bench handy that Ann Logan said she always sat on . She was kept on the go so much , she said , that she was always glad of a chance to get off her feet awhile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Hannah liked to stand . . . liked to grip the dasher with both hands and feel its thick plunging movement into the milk , up and down . Once her hands felt the exact thickness of the milk , for it varied with the heat and the length of time it had taken to turn , she set her stroke and kept to it steadily , seeming tireless until the butter had come . Ann had watched her the first time . " I do n't believe it tires you at all . " " No , " Hannah had said , " I d'know as it does . But I d'know as churnin ' is a thing to wear on a body anyhow . " " It does me , " Ann had said , laughing . " As long as I 've been doing it , which is all my life , my arm still gets so tired it feels like it 's going to drop off . " " You go at it too fast . You do ever'thing in sich a rush , like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' done . Hit is tiresome thataway . " Ann nodded . " That 's what Ben tells me , but I ca n't help it . That 's the way I am . " " Folks are different , " Hannah agreed . This morning Ann was down the row at the last cabin . Some travelers had come in during the night and one of the little ones was ailing . She was helping out . She was a good woman , Hannah thought . She had been good to her beyond all hope or expectation , though Tice had said she would be . And Ben  | had been good , too . Of course they were used to people coming and going in their house , staying the night , or maybe for weeks until there was a cabin for them to move into . They had acted as if she belonged with them , though . Right from the start , and it had been three weeks now , Ann had taken it for granted she 'd help , and without appearing to be bossy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah was kept as busy as she herself . Hannah had turned her hand to whatever came up , minding the little boys , cooking , washing up , sweeping and cleaning , dressing out meat  --  all the things that the care of a family held , and more than once Ann had said , gratefully , " Hannah , you 're such a big help . " And she knew she was . But she knew , too , that all she was doing , actually , was paying her way with the coin at hand . She was n't doing her own work in her own way . She was marking time , still thinking , still pondering what , in the end , she must do . Tice had gone for the spinning wheel the next week after they had reached the fort . The women had crowded about the wheel , their rough hands handling it and turning it , examining it with envious eyes . " Seems like , " Jane Manifee had said wistfully , " I c'n feel the wool in my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' fillip ' up the bobbin . They ai n't but one other in the country that I know of . Ann Poague , up at Harrod 's , has got one . She brung it over the Gap when her an ' William come on . She 's got her a loom , now , too . I 'm aimin ' to have me one soon as we git settled out . If , " she added fiercely , " we ever git shut of this bein ' fortified , which it seems like we ai n't never goin ' to do ! " It was what all the women longed for , to get out of the fort , into their own homes , onto their own land . They put up with the fort , lived closely together quarrelsomely or harmoniously according to their natures , but they all looked longingly over the fence , yearned toward the time when they could walk out of the gate and take up their own lives again . Hannah noticed that Ann Logan said nothing as the other women talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing for her to say . The fort was her home . It was built on Ben Logan 's land . Not ever , so long as there was need of the fort , could she get outside the fence . All the rest could go when the time came , but she was anchored , because her man was different , had in some way taken the lead and other men looked to him for help . Hannah felt pity for her and seeing Ann's'hands on the wheel offered gently , " If they 's e'er thing you got to use it fer , Ann , it 's your'n to use . " Ann laughed and put her hands behind her . " By the time I have need of it , Ben 'll see that I 've got one , and a loom , too . " Hannah believed her . There would be nothing Ben Logan would n't see to , as time and opportunity came to him to see . " My ma had a good loom , " she said , " but I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , though , an ' I aim to . Some day , I aim to . " The women had looked at her , nudged one another and laughed . Jane  | Manifee had spoken for them . " Git you a man an ' a place to put it first , Hannah , then build you a loom . " Hannah 's neck and cheeks had grown warm . They were n't being unkind , she knew . They were n't poking fun . They were only teasing , saying what to them seemed inevitable . Get you a man first , and the other things would come . A woman belonged with a man . They had all then broken into laughter and had begun teasing her about the men who had prinked themselves and come with one errand or another to Ann 's cabin . " Are you aimin ' to take Isaac , Hannah ? Not for a year has he shaved off them whiskers , till you come . We 'd done forgot the look of his naked face . " " Silas , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one for you , Hannah . He 's a mite on the old side , but he 's steady , an ' he 's been wed before . he knows the ways of a woman better'n some . " Their eyes had winked and their elbows had flown about , nudging , and they had whispered behind their hands . " John , I reckon , " another had said , " is the handsomest , but he 's flightly now . He cai n't never make up his mind . He 's staked off an ' traded three claims of land already , allus lookin ' for a better one . He mought be uncertain about his woman , though , would be the trouble . But he 's handsome , an ' no denyin ' it . " Jane Manifee had sniffed . " Handsome is as handsome does . Now , in my opinion , you 'd do best to marry William Whitfield . Of course he 's been widdered , an ' he 's got them younguns , but you 'd never want with William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overly so . Not miserly at all . In my opinion you could n't do no better than to take William . " Hannah listened , turning her face from one of the women to the other , thinking , as each spoke , of the man she named . There was Isaac Turner . He 'd been among the first to come . " I brung you a little piece of meat , Ann , seein ' as you got extry to feed . " His face had been so recently shaved it had still looked scraped and raw . His hair had been slicked back with bear oil and clubbed with a thong of new elkskin . He was a little , thin , rabbity man with a nervous Adam 's apple and he had sat perched on the stool by the doorway as if any sudden noise would send him skittering . He had spoken not more than half a dozen times , always to Ann , but his eyes had constantly sought Hannah across the room  --  not openly and curiously , but carefully and secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking . It had made her feel like covering herself with something , hiding away where he could n't see her . She had n't in any way taken to Isaac , but he had been among the most persistent . Hardly a day went by that he did n't make an opportunity to come to the cabin . Ann had been patient with him , and Hannah had done her best , not wanting to hurt his feelings , but she wondered that he could n't see she went out of her way to avoid him . There was Silas Barnham . He 'd come , too , the same day as Isaac . He was an older man , big and angled and bearded grayly . Forthrightly he had come , making no excuse with meat or any other offering . He 'd come , spoken briefly with Ann , looked at Hannah boldly , watched her as she went on with her
