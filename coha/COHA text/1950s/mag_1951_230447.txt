The four-minute mile is an elusive phantom that middle-distance runners have been closely pursuing since Paavo Nurmi set his mark of 4:10.4 in 1923 . Some track coaches insist that it is a physical impossibility ; others , pointing to the 1945 world record of 4:01.4 set by Sweden 's Gunder Haegg , say it will be done eventually . Last week at the Penn Relays , some 40,000 roaring fans at Franklin Field caught a fleeting glimpse of a runner who may be the first to make it a reality . The man : Britain 's 22-year-old Roger Bannister , a skinny ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 154 Ibs . ) Oxford.University student who became a runner because he was too light to be a crew man . <P> Like New Zealand 's Jack Lovelock , Miler Bannister looks more like a bookworn medical student ( which he is ) than a crack athlete . Bannister was a flop at cross-country , but the first time he tried the mile he turned in a creditable 4:30 . A fortnight ago , as a warmup for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the combined Oxford-Cambridge squad ) , he reeled off a whippet-fast three-quarters in 2:56.8 , just missing ( by .2 sec. ) the world 's fastest three-quarters , run by Sweden 's Arne Andersson . <P> When Bannister stepped on to the track last week against Don Gehrmann and Fred Wilt , the best of the U.S. milers , conditions were far from ideal for a fast race . The new quarter-mile track had been churned up by some 3,000 pounding runners , a gusty wind was blowing , and any time under 4:10 seemed highly unlikely . For the first half mile Bannister was content to stay with the pack ( paced at a stodgy 2:06.2 by Stewart Ray ) . But before the four runners hit the three-quarter mark , Bannister , clearly impatient with the pace , lengthened his rangy stride and spurted to the lead . <P> He never stopped sprinting . His whirlwind 56.7 final quarter , run with a graceful , almost lazy style , was the most dazzling burst ever seen in the 57-year history of the Penn Relays . It completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Glenn Cunningham 's 17-year-old Penn Relay record by 3.5 sec . Bannister 's time : 4:08.3 . <P> Though Bannister had run his fastest mile ever , had thoroughly whipped the best in the U.S. , he was still not satisfied with his showing . Said he , with an apologetic grin : " I was rather expecting Ray to set a faster pace , but when he did n't , I had to go out and do it by myself . " Then , with refreshing candor , Bannister added : " Had I been pressed ... I would have simply accelerated ... I think I could have done 4:05 . " <P> Other Penn Relay winners ( and good bets for the 1952 Olympics ) : Seton Hall 's Andy Stanfield , the broad jump ( with a record leap of 25 ft. 4 in. ) and the 100-yd. dash ( time : 9.8 ) . <P> <P> West Point 's Dick Shea , the two-mile run in 9:11.9 , beating Greg Rice 's meet mark by .3 sec . <P> Cornell 's Charley Moore , the 400-meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cornell 's record-breaking mile relay ( time : 3:13.1 ) and shuttle relay .
