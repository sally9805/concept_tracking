A tired , 63-year-old man went back to work last week at a fearsome job , and the 16 million Protestants in Communist East Germany gave thanks for his decision . Heinrich Grber 's white hair is thinning rapidly and he is racked with angina pectoris , but there is nobody who has proved able to deal so effectively with the Communists on behalf of East Germany 's Protestants . <P> Courage and pain trained Pastor Grber for his job . In 1934 the Nazis ousted him from his post as director of a children 's home in Templin . Brandenburg . His church sent him to a parish in East Berlin . Victims of the Nazis soon learned that Pastor Grber would help them , and many of them fled to his church for refuge . He set up an underground organization to hide them in apartments , penthouses and garden sheds , to smuggle them abroad . <P> The Knock on the Door . In 1940 , just before Christmas , there came the ineviable knock on the door . At the concentration camp in Sachsenhausen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Dachau , they threw his body on a pile of corpses after a heart attack had left him more dead than alive . He got out in 1943 . <P> After the war , Grber was appointed pastor of the Marienkirche , the oldest undestroyed church in Berlin 's inner city . Several of the men he had known in concentration camps became top officials in the Communist government , and they trusted the earnest , red-faced man whose religious principles had led him to the same ugly places as their political convictions had led them . In 1949 Pastor Grber was appointed plenipotentiary from the Evangelical Church to the Communist government at Pankow . <P> He became the man in the middle . The Western press attacked him when , after a visit to Communist-run Sachsenhausen , he announced that the inmates received better food and treatment than under the Nazis . But soon after his visit , 15,000 prisoners in Soviet zone concentration camps were released in an amnesty credited to Grber ; another Grber-inspired amnesty is said to be imminent . <P> No Talent for Politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church synod-because he appeared at an East German " National Congress , " publicly condemned the presence of U.S. atomic cannon in Germany , and called for a ban on nuclear weapons , a step the Russians favor . Pastor Grber asked the synod to accept his resignation . <P> When word spread through Soviet Germany that Heinrich Grber might go , consternation welled up among the Protestants . and protest rolled in . " There must be a way to relieve Pastor Grber of his pastoral duties without necessarily jeopardizing his position as plenipotentiary ... " Said the weekly Potsdam Kirche : " Too many people are waiting for his services ... " Last week the Evangelical Church 's Bishop Otto Dibelius announced that Grber , though he would no longer be pastor of the Marienkirche , would continue his job of go-between . Said Heinrich Grber as he went back to work : " I have no talent for politics . I entered into poli tics only to help men . "                  @ @ @
