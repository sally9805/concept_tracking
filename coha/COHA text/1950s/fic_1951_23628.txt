Night Riders of Northville A Story by Hortense Calisher Drawings by Anthony Saris N SMOKY spring evenings , from the windows of the commuters ' train which rides through the lowlands of Jersey , the little bars , which are seldom more than a block or so from the stations , look like hot coals burning in the thin dusk . Spotted over the countryside , they send up their signal flares , promising the fought-off moment of excitement before you open the door  --  when it seems as if someone may just this minute have said : " Here is the place  --  the place , " ? and the flat , sold feeling after the door is open , and you see that this is just about like any such place anywhere . If , having missed your usual train perhaps , you stop off at the particular hole-in-a-corner which clings to your station ? , Joe 's Place , or Morelli 's , or the Rainbow Tavern  --  and you sit there over your glass , after your phone call , waiting for the taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , after the quick rash of one-shot commuters is over , that you are alone , or almost alone , with perhaps a solitary , leather-jacketed baggageman musing over his beer on his stool down at the other end . And you wonder what keeps a joint like this alive . Down in the thriving center of town , or settled here and there on its skirting streets , are places , certainly , which cater more specially to a man 's sudden convivial needs , or to his malaises . Out on the highway which is never far from such a town , the roadhouses , each evening , corral the people who want steak , pizza , chicken-in-the-basket . There is a " good place to take the family and still geta drink , " a haunt for the juke-box babies , a daytime spot which draws the lawyers from the courthouse over at the county seat , even a swank little box of a place where certain rich women of the town gather to sip away time from the huge carafe of it that confronts them each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because no man or woman lives his life in just one context , sooner or later you may see a person who more properly belongs in a particular one of these places , seated , explicably or not , in another . But the nondescript place where you are sitting now  --  could it be said to have a category ? To whom or what could it cater , other than to the casual , modestly sated thirsts of its portion of two trainfuls a day of men homeward bound toward the snow shovel or the garden , or toward the less seasonal dictates of the television , the wife , and the children with egg on their chins ? And as you rise , relievedly , to the toot of a horn outside , and exchange diffident nods with the owner , you decide that his reserve with you on this and other occasions is the case , not because you are not a regular , but because there are no regulars here . As you go out the door , you wonder idly how he hangs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , when the trains are all but stilled , totting up his suppliers ' bills and his receipts , and worrying about a better spot for trade . Should you sit on there for a sufficient number of evenings , however , you might learn how wrong you were . For that place is one NIGHT RIDERS of a circuit of such places which certain men of the town ride ceaselessly , for reasons which neither appear to be simple nor are . T AKE , for instance , the Rainbow Tavern at Northville , and four of its regulars  --  James De Vries , Dicky English , Jack Burdette , and Henry Lister . If you get to know the habits of these four , who are sure to appear there singly or in varying combinations almost every night of the week  --  and if you happen to learn of a minor tragedy which befell one of them  --  then in the course of time you may also sense , although you may never quite be able to put your finger on it , the nature of that specialiM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James De Vries , who is always called " the judge , " out of deference to the fact that he was once , for several years , a justice of the peace , is the only one of the four who was born in Northville  --  and perhaps some of the deference is to this fact too . In a town where most of the men make their living elsewhere , he is one of those vanishing few who subsist on their inherited knowledge of the place and the " connections " in it  --  a little banking , some law , a few real-estate transactions , and a little politicking . He can tell you the real legend of the old Viner place , and what went on there in the old days , can search a title in his mind before he has to refer to county records , and lives in the ground-floor apartment of the cupolaed house in which he was born  --  the house bought by his grandfather , who was a minor henchman of Boss Tweed . Although there has never been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clings to him , somehow , the equivocal aura of the man who turns a dollar because he is in the know . As he stands at the bar , with his hat brim turned low over his long , swart face , so that if you are near him and fairly tall you can not glimpse anything but his mouth ( for the judge is quite short , and in the manner of many short men , affects hats a little too high in the crown and wide of brim ) ? he keeps a silence weighted faintly with an indication that silence is what he has come here for . If he is addressed , however , on a question of local affairs , he likes to pronounce the answers in a measured , monotonous voice , although he will never keep the conversational ball rolling with the added fillip of a question or an opinion . He is at the bar briefly at five , at seven-thirty , and at ten , so precisely that Denis , the owner , often answers a time query from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last round . " He has two drinks at five , three at seven-thirty , and three at ten , always of straight bourbon with a dash of bitters , and always set before him by Denis as soon as he appears . He has probably not ordered out loud for years , never buys or is bought a drink , and has long since managed to convey , by this routine , that for him liquor  --  something to be accomplished , as it were , as is a meal by a man not interested in the table  --  is never in any case a specific for some disreputable need . It is ironic , therefore , that in a place where casualness and haphazard spontaneity are part of the mores , the very carefulness of the judge 's behavior has made him the oddity he imagines he is not . For , often , when a man is to be found night after night in the same place , swaying deep in drink , progressing through the stereotype stages of the drunk  --  from the painful interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the final , locked communion with the glass  --  often a common thing to be heard in the pitying undertones behind him is : " Nice guy though . They say his wife is a bitch . " But in the Rainbow Tavern this is most commonly said of the judge . Not by any of the other three regulars , incidentally , for all the regulars share a solidarity of reticence about their affairs outside , one even stronger than is usual among men perhaps , and peculiarly noticeable , since it suggests that , with them , home may be really the outside , and " inside " is here . No one knows ? the origin of this rumor about the judge , or any verification for it , for although the other three know each other in another context , the social life of the town  --  have visited each other in their homes , and even , by prearrangement , have brought their wives here , after the manner of men who twice a year tolerate ladies ' night at the club  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never brings his " outside " here . The rumor arises , possibly , because there is no worse place to hide than among the heightened awarenesses of others who are hiding too . W ttEN a man walks into the Rainbow Tavern , it is often possible to tell his mood , at what stage in the circuit he is , or how full he is or intends to be , from the angle at which he wears his hat . Dicky English 's hat is always tipped toward the back of his head . This is true of him wherever he is making an entrance , whether to the Rainbow or others of its ilk , to a party , to a meeting of one of the dozens of committees on which he is a prime mover , or to the smoker of the morning train , A buzzing , bustling , smart dresser of a man , in whose freshly barbered face , above his bow-tie , the slightly juvenile features are only healthfully obscured by a faintly moony , fortyish fat , Dicky , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a number of fair typists in the office of which he is manager . Longer acquaintance with Dicky suggests , however , that in his very trueness to form there is something much too credible . Watching him at first , one is bored or amused by the larger-than-life verisimilitude of the man ; later one wonders how , under such a bewildering collection of verisimilitudes , there can be a man at all . Here , one says , as he struts chestily into a conversation , or , his backside waggling in jaunty efficiency , is seen disappearing round the bend in the center of two or three cronies he has marshaled on an errand of pleasure  --  here is the eternal seller of tickets to raffles , the organizer of poker games and pig roasts ; here is the lifeof-the-party , in whom , as with so many such , there is just enough of the clown , the simpleton , the butt  --  so that by his very Mises he breaks down the united ice of others , warming them , even at the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his intimates at the Rainbow , where his invariable greeting is " You 're planning to go , are n't you ? " , his invariable adieu " Be sure to be there , now , " Dicky passes for a joiner , a mixer , a man whose compulsion barely escapes buffoonery , but is invaluable to those whose gregariousness is more wistful , less competent . He is sensitive to the needs of the company , too  --  a Rotarian in Rotary , a father among fathers , a fornicator among fornicators  --  always so long as he can go on talking . Even his drinking is versatile and somehow controlled ; he is good for an elegiac , gossipy chat in a corner or for an all-night spree with the boys , but even in the midst of the spree he never seems personally drunk . Only when you see him at home , a paterfamilias outdoing all others , or at a roadhouse , perhaps , this time with the wife , to whom he is playing the uxoriously gallant part of the husband on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he persists in reading tidbits of news to men whose issues of the same paper are already slack and crumpled in their hands  --  only then may you realize that Dicky is more than a man who lives for the occasion  --  he is a man who can not live without it , however small . Like those little mechanical toy men with the keys in their split , metal backs , he will scuttle around and around only as long as the original impetus lasts  --  one begins to imagine , behind the truckling rounds of his talk , a gasping prescience that , when he slackens , he will topple over on his side forever . He is a man who convinces himself into humanity only by the ululating sound of his own voice . And because one can imagine him en route to an experience , or possibly from it , but never actually in the middle of it , one forms conclusions as to Dicky 's reasons for stopping so often at a place like the Rainbow , which is essentially , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lister -- there is no need to take up separately two who are almost always together . They roomed together at college , went into business and married at about the same time , bought houses on adjoining streets in that fancy modern development in Northville before it was too evident that their wives would never get along , and refugees now , each from the disapproval of two wives , are ever more closely united in the deep beatitudes of the bottle . Jack is a great beef of a man with a fine nose just beginning to vein , and an extraordinarily sweet smile which , with the cleft in the first of his chins , forms a solitary fleur-de-lis above the others . He is one of those large , deceptively solid men who melt in drink ; as the evening advances , the smile grows fixed on a face which recedes behind it like a huge , fair egg , the bottom outline of which has been drawn several times over by a wavering artist . Seen over his shoulder , in that rich , Rembrandt-colored air of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , Henry Lister 's face , mouse-sharp and precise , does not change at all . There is no mystery about Henry unless it is the absence of one . He is a neutral common denominator of a man , whose sole departure from the ordinary is his drinking ; even the latter seems an effort to fill up the uncomfortable reservoir of his averageness . He is never out of place in any company he keeps , and never quite of it ; he is a man who is always seen over someone else 's shoulder  --  in this case Jack 's . Over the years , the association of these two has effected a likeness quite apart from looks ? the kind of dual semblance which occurs in a long , uneventful marriage . Jack , an investment counselor , often surprises his business acquaintances with quite a bookish allusion , and Henry , who is in the trade department of a book house , is considered by his colleagues to be pretty sharp on the market . During the business day , Jack 's eye is remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry 's manner may be a little on the vague side , but at closing time in the Rainbow , after the long , matched session of glass for glass , it is Henry who gently leads the faltering Jack away from the bar and drives him home . One might think that their wives  --  both childless , both graduates of the stern discipline of the evasive phone call , the mummified supper , the endless evening in the empty living-room , of which there happens to be a counterpart not half a block away  --  one would think that they might pool their grievances in a sort of friendship too . Such is not the case , however . They hate each other  --  oddly enough each of the women saves her invective not for her rival , but for his wife . It is simpler that way perhaps . Or possibly it is easier to bear the onus of a rival than the presence of someone whose grievances are the same . Once or twice Henry and Jack have been known to josh each other over this quirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cliches with which men refer to women at the Rainbow , where it is generally conceded that the ladies , all of them sphinxes , are worth the solving at times , but blessedly not here and now . Mostly , however , the two men sit in silence , accumulating on the abacus of their bar bill an ever huger total of hours they have spent thus together , two eunuchs sitting in a quietude from which trouble has been castrated , at a comfortable , derisive distance from the harem . This , then , was the way things stood with the four regulars , when Mrs. Henry Lister , on a pink May evening which contrasted ( who knows how fiercely ) with her sallow day , cut her wrists . 0 N THE Monday night when the phone rang in the booth at the Rainbow , the four men had the bar to themselves . This is often the case on Mondays , for at the Rainbow there is a discernable , taken-for-granted rhythm to the evenings of the week . Sunday is the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until four . Tuesdays and Wednesdays are slow ; even Henry and Jack may not appear until after ten or perhaps not at all , presumably having gone home for a token dinner and been prevailed upon to stay . Thursdays are pretty normal , and Fridays the bar begins to expand again , with men who drink in a certain propriety , duty-bound , as it were , to honor the inception of the weekend . Saturday is a poor night for the regulars , who are shunted out of their niche by celebrants who come ( as the four indicate to each other with faint shrugs ) apparently from nowhere , and Denis is kept busy shooing minors out of the place . But on Sunday nights the bar really hums , with an added group of familiars who arrive gratefully after the dearth of the day . Meeting on the station platform the morning after , the three regulars ( for the judge , of course , does not commute ) greet one another with reminiscent shakes of the head , eying one another 's gray gills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding distance in the smoker , retiring glumly behind their papers . If a man just makes the train by the skin of his teeth , this is the one morning on which he is not chaffed . Even Dicky English has learned to shut his face on Monday morning . During this particular first day of the business week , the city streets had been stroked with summer . When the evening train set down its passengers in Northville , it could be seen that the leaves , although still new against the sky , were no longer single and choice . The air had a beautiful , clear expectancy about it , like the inside of a glass bell that was about to be rung . The door of the Rainbow , though not yet screened , had been ajar . Now , with the bar to themselves , the four were settled restfully on their stools like convalescents from a mutual illness , just able to savor the malted dimness of the place in the safely muted company of their kind . Henry and Jack had been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second round , and Dicky had just breezed in . " Some night last night , eh Denis ? " said Dicky . Denis nodded . He was a profound listener , with a repertoire of silent assent which ranged from the nod to a look of alert , pained sympathy which came , actUaIly , from varicose veins , but was a great help to his business . Dicky tipped his hat farther back on his head . " Hear Patterson 's still on the town . They say he never did get home . " " In here about four o'clock for a minute , " said Denis , polishing a glass . " Better watch himself lately . " Dicky clapped his hands together , raised one to readjust his hat , looked about him minutely as if to search the possibilities of the hour , and let his arm sink around jack 's neck . " Howja do at the office today , pal ? " Jack turned his head carefully within the encircling arm , and smiled his sweet , ponderous smile . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? He looks able to sit up and take nourishment . " Henry screwed his eyes shut appreciatively . Down at the left end of the bar , the judge looked owlishly into an empty glass . Denis moved quickly to replace it with the third and last of his round . And the telephone rang . No one at the bar flinched in notice , although the telephone rings infrequently at the Rainbow . The phone knew better than to call for any of the men . here . Denis shuffled through the archway into the alcove which held the phone booth and the pinball machine . After a minute he re-NIGHT RIDERS turned , gestured at Henry , and returned to his polishing . Henry pointed at himself with raised eyebrows , shrugged , and walked out to the booth . He was there for sometime . " Da-te-da , da-te-da , da-te-da , " said Dicky , falsetto . Jack hunched himself over the bar , lit a cigarette , dropped the match on the floor before it was quite dead , and rubbed it out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Dicky . Henry stood in the archway , his face white , his arms dangling uncertainly at his sides . " The police . They took Alice to the hospital . " Jack lurched to his feet . " Something with the car , Hen ? " " She tried to . . . " Henry turned his head from side to side . " She acted all right this morning , " he said on a high note . " She acted perfectly okay . " " Drive you down , fella ? " said Dicky . Henry seemed not to have heard him . He reached out and touched the bar surface . His hand crept along it as if he expected to find a tab there . " They want to type my blood they said . " He moved toward the door . " I 'll go with you , Hen . " Jack went toward him , weaving a little . " No , " said Henry . His eyes returned to focus . He shivered . " No . Do n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Call me here . Call me if you need me . " There was no answer except the current of air from the swinging door . They heard the splutter of a motor , its outraged whine and diminuendo . Through the door , which remained ajar , came the dark , stealing scents of May . After a minute , Denis walked over and closed it . " She have a miss you think ? " whispered Dicky . No one answered him . The judge coughed , and spoke . " Sold them that house they have . Over on Summit . . June ' 42 it was , just before the rise . Nice little property . " He shook his head , as if he could not be responsible for the way people mishandled their lives to which he had helped them attach a property of value . Then , glancing at the clock , he saw that it was time . Pulling his hat brim lower , he nodded and left . - " Well , guess I'm-on my way too , " said Dicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the morning then . " He eased himself halfway out the door , then poked his head back in . " Chilly , " he said , shaking his head solemnly , and shut the door behind him . It can be awkward , drinking alone at a bar . Is the man behind it wholly a servitor at such times , or must recognition be made of the fact that two human beings are together in an otherwise empty room ? At such times it is good to be where one is known . Denis sat reading his newspaper , his shell-rims far down on his nose , his presence as sane and reassuring as a night nurse . It was a racing final he read ; occasionally he made a mark on it with pencil , or rose to freshen Jack 's glass . There were no other demands on his attention either from his customer or from the phone . Gradually the room , although it had no fireplace , took on- the guttering look of a room in which a fire dies down . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Denis went to the booth , called a cabby with whom he had an arrangement , shook Jack by the shoulder , and sent him home . T HE next day , in the smoker , Dicky had the field to himself . Henry , of course , was absent , and jack did not appear for several days . On the second of these , the smoker heard , as the town had already heard , that Mrs. Henry Lister had muffed it . She would survive . This was received as such news is . The suicide attempt which is successful has an awesome achievement about it , before which we quail , but bow . It is a terrible epitaph , but it is one , and its headstone will sooner or later be obscured like any other . But the incompetent who has botched , who has been retrieved against his will , has committed an indecency . He has brought his nakedness not to the tomb , but to the teatable . Later , his existence will fret us. like that of the invalid whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack returned to the train , it was observed that he had the drained , pearly look of dedication of the man who is on the wagon . No comments were made , since it was known how close Jack had been to Henry  --  too close , it was assumed , for comfort . Not a few of the other men who had be , 2n riding the circuit a little too steadily were , over that weekend , unwontedly solicitous of their wives and gardens . But , the following week , when Henry , too , returned to the train , it was plain that the shaft which Mrs. Lister had aimed at her husband had not only struck glancingly at his friend , but had also sheared between the two . Their steps no longer joined naturally , they greeted each other with the creaking tact of constraint , and although they both were avoiding the Rainbow , they did not do so together . When Heriy , t.king his month off early , took his wife down to Atlantic City , both the town and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the proper thing ( if there could be said to be any protocol for such circumstances ) not only for his wife , but for the community . For a long time , Henry would be a constriction on any company he kept  --  precisely because he had suffered no conventional loss . Had he done so , however unusually , one could still have offered him the normal currency of condolence . One could have demonstrated one 's fealty at the funeral parlor , or , meeting him at a later date , extended to him , according to the degrees of delicacy and acquaintance , either the mute clasp of the hand , or one of those basso-timbred remarks with which we acknowledge to one another that we are all as dust . Still later , after his sorrow was a little out of its black , one could have propelled him tenderly toward drink , as one propels a widow toward tears . As things were , however , Mrs. Lister and death , in their brief affair together , had cuckolded Henry ; had made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D URING the weeks of Henry 's absence , Jack returned , little by little , to the Rainbow . Each evening he walked in earlier and stayed on later , until , rosy once more , he was back at the old routine . On those evenings when Denis judged him unfit to drive himself home , the cabman was called . Or sometimes the cabby checked for himself , in a friendly sort of way . One evening , just after Denis had made the call , Jack put his glass down on the bar with a rap that raised Denis ' startled glance from his paper , and leaned intently over the bar . " Not the same around here , is it , Denis ? " he muttered . " Not the same . " He looked into the glass which he was swiveling in his hand . After a moment he looked up again . " It never will be the same , " he said , in a voice suddenly free of rheum . Denis , who , in his trade , witnessed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag-ends and persals , kept his own counsel . On another Monday night , this time late in June , Dicky , the judge , and Jack once more had the bar to themselves . It was again the time of the judge 's second round , and Dicky , again , had just breezed in . There was nothing oddly Aristotelian about this unity of time , space , and character ; as must be clear by now , the very predictability of the Rainbow , the very reassurance of the way in which evenings spent there tend to blur into one long , continuous evening , is a part of its stock in trade . This night , however , was the one on which Henry Lister chose to return . When he walked through the door , which was screened now , and had been closed against the humming insect tide of summer , his manner in no way admitted that this was a return , or that there had been , at any time , a choice to be made . Denis , alone of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the other friends there was a momentary flash , like that on a mirror turned once against the light and laid flat . To the right of Jack , who was farthest down the bar , there were three empty stools . Henry sat down on the middle one of these . " Evening , " said Henry . " Judge . . Jack . . . Dicky ... evening . " From the quiet chorus of greetings , Dicky 's rose with verve . " Well look who 's here ! If you are n't a sight for sore eyes ! " He walked over and pumped Henry 's hand with unction . " Looking fit , boy , " he added , in the low , secret tones of allegiance . " Real fit . " Behind him , the others stared into their drinks , but on Henry 's face there was a singular look of gratitude . It was as if Dicky , in doing what might be expected of Dicky , had shown him that whatever else he had returned for was likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , each punctuating his remarks with helpful arc of his glass . They said little of local affairs , of all that can happen in a town , or a bar , while someone is away . They talked rather of things in the tenor of the times , of the National League and the American , of the price of government , and the probabilities of war They spoke of the things people have to keep up to date on , no matter what has happened to diem or where they have been . Time passed , enough for the judge to leave and return for his final call . When the judge was on his last drink of the evening , Henry bought a drink for the crowd , sliding down a stool to the one next to Jack 's . " How about you , Judge ? " he said . " Break down and have an extra ? " This was an old gambit , and the judge made his accustomed response . " Oh no , " he said , frowning , made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the men smiled at each other , taking pleasure in the foibles of their kind . On Henry 's face there was again the look of gratitude . After a while Dicky went into the alcove to play the pinball game . When the cabman poked his head in with an inquiring look , Jack looked down at the floor . " Tell him never mind , " said Henry 's voice over his shoulder . " I 'll drive you home . " It grew late , but the tawny light in the Rainbow deepened and mellowed , as if it , not the whiskey , had the power to turn men rubicund or gray . The silence purred , that silence of the Rainbow which is like the purring of a great torn , resting from the rat cries of reality , from the quest for cream , and the squeaky , flagellant voices of women . From time to time came the ratchety-slat of the pinball machine , than which there is no more aimless sound in the world . And after a while , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
