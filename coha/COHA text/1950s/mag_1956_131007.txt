The speeding ghosts of Sindelfingen take on their concrete form in David Douglas Duncan 's photographs on the following pages . This is Mercedes today : the bright and gleaming sports cars which go through the final body assembly at the Sindelfingen plant , the 300SLs , the 190SLs , the magic come true . The fact that they exist at all is , in itself , remarkable . // In 1945 , when the war ended , five Mercedes plants  --  in Untert ? rkheim , Sindelfingen , Gaggenau , Mannheim and West Berlin  --  lay in ruins . By the end of 1946 Mercedes had produced 214 cars . By 1948 it had risen to 3,812 . Two years later , in 1950 , workers rolled 33,960 units of all kinds off the production line . Two years after that , in 1952 , Mercedes was back in the races again . // A seasoned band of professionals was in charge of the racing team . Dr. Fritz Nallinger was its boss and chief engineer . Dr. Rudolf Uhlenhaut , British-born , was its technical wizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track , in his old capacity of manager of the drivers and mechanics , was Alfred Neubauer , the colorful martinet whose pear-shaped form had been as familiar on Europe 's prewar raceways as the ringed star itself . // The first Mercedes to race again was a sports car . Fritz Nallinger concluded that existing designs for the supercharged prewar racers were unsuited for further development under the new Grand Prix formula . But in the sports car field , most of the necessary equipment was already at hand , and it was Rudolf Uhlenhaut who put it to use and scored the first great successes for the ringed star again . // Using the Mercedes 300S model with its six-cylinder , 150-hp engine as a point of departure , Uhlenhaut produced a light , three-dimensional tubular frame , canted the 300S engine on its side to permit a lower hoodline and stepped up its output to nearly 200 hp . A new aluminum racing brake drum was added , with a cast-iron rim and radial cooling fins , and from wind tunnel work came an enclosed aluminum body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 300SL ( Super Light ) , and its appearance in 1952 signaled the ascendancy of the Mercedes star once more . Second and fourth in Italy 's tortuous Mille Miglia , it took first and second places in the grueling 24-hour test at Le Mans and repeated that performance in Mexico 's car-killing Pan-American Road Race . // After that campaign Mercedes quit racing again , partly to start the 300SL toward the assembly line at Sindelfingen , but chiefly to concentrate its efforts on the arduous task of developing a new Grand Prix winner . // Carburetors were discarded and fuel injection adopted as a superior means of supplying the engine . Daimler-Benz had helped design fuel-injection systems for the engines of the Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf World War II fighters and the Heinkel bombers ; before that the firm had had a long acquaintance with the diesel engines . A knottier problem was the design of a new valve system for the Grand Prix car . The goal was to employ the largest possible valves to produce maximum engine breathing . For a year a team of engineers worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve-closing spring had to be done away with  --  there would be no place for a spring of the strength needed . So they brought up to date an old principle that was tested inconclusively by Mercedes in 1912 and used with indifferent success on a French sports car of the 1920s  --  the " desmodromic " valve system , in which the valve is coupled directly with its operating mechanism . // The problem was chiefly one of metallurgy and of designing a camshaft lobe correctly timed to push the valve shut . In solving it with the right alloys and the proper camshaft contour , the engineers achieved all they had hoped for and more . // Opponents on the racing circuits were run ragged by the cars on which the valves appeared . Developing 300 hp from a 2 ? - liter fuel-injection engine  --  50 more than the long-standing ideal of 100 hp per liter  --  the Mercedes W196 Grand Prix car carried Juan Fangio to two world championships , sweeping five of six major events in the 1955 season . // On top of that , Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300SLR , a prototype model derived from the Grand Prix racer . After a record-breaking victory in last year 's Mille Miglia , withdrawal while within reach of success at Le Mans because of the tragic Mercedes accident which took 87 lives , and another first in Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort , the 300SLRs invaded Sicily needing one more victory in the rugged Targa Florio to snatch the world sports car championship away from the renowned Italian Ferrari factory . // The incredibly thoroughgoing way in which Mercedes approached the Targa Florio was typical of the firm 's devout belief that winning races is 95% preparation and 5% luck . It is a belief that is carried out in the factory and on the racing circuits with an attention to detail unapproached by any racing competitor . // In support of the three official Targa Florio race cars , Mercedes brought along : 12 more cars for practice , 42 mechanics , spare parts enough to build a complete car , wheels and tires in superabundance and four mobile shortwave radio stations for swift communication of intelligence to the Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of experts studied the course with painstaking care , taking into account every variation in road width and grade , measuring exactly the length of each straight and the radius of each curve . Even the moisture content of the air was sampled before the data was calculated in terms of proper gear ratios and tire pressures and a precise pattern for braking and shifting the cars on a wet or dry surface . Where other drivers had to improvise in a dozen ways , the Mercedes team , as usual , began practice knowing what moves to make every inch of the way . // Mercedes needed a victory , and it was won ( although drivers Stirling Moss and Peter Collins each took an unpremeditated spin off the road before receiving the checkered flag ) , and with it , by the margin of a single point , the sports car championship . // Having proved its racing preeminence and achieved publicity of incalculable value for its entire manufacturing line , Daimler-Benz retired from racing again and settled down to tend its workaday , bread-and-butter business . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the last 10 years , through 1955 , Daimler-Benz produced more than 400,000 vehicles , ' of which nearly 300,000 were passenger cars and the rest commercial machines : trucks , buses , fire-fighting equipment and a revolutionary general-purpose vehicle called the UNIMOG . The initial postwar Mercedes work force of 38 repair men in 1945 has been boosted to over 40,000 today . // Last year was the best ever for Daimler-Benz . Already first among German automotive manufacturers in value of production , the firm turned out 64,000 passenger cars and 29,000 commercial units . Sales jumped to $330 million , a 35% increase over 1954 , and vital export sales advanced from $85 million in 1954 to more than $120 million as vehicles bearing the ringed star penetrated 126 countries . // The most glamorous of these by far are the sports cars , the 300SL and the new 190SL . The one a superb example of the Gran Turismo type , its smaller counterpart primarily a high-performance touring sports car , they are the dispensers of the magic , the proudest bearers of the Mercedes emblem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that on the streets of Sindelfingen , where they are as much a part of the daily scene as the hausfraus ' laundry hanging on the line , heads still turn to follow them as they pass by .
