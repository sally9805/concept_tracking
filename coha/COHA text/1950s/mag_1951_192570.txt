THE SELECTED LETTERS OF WILLIAM COWPER ( 306 pp. ) - Edited by Mark Van Doren-Farrar , Straus &; Young ( $3.50 ) . <P> Now stir the fire , and close the shutters fast , Let fall the curtains , wheel the sofa round , And while the bubbling and loud hissing urn Throws up a steamy column , and the cups That cheer but not inebriate , wait on each , So let us welcome peaceful evening in . <P> At William Cowper 's kindly beckoning , the readers of two centuries have lulled away many a peaceful evening-cheered , but never inebriated-at the mild brew of his poetry . Cowper ( rhymes with hooper ) is remembered fondly as a plump old country gentleman in a billowy cap ; apt to giggle , but otherwise of a most pleasing conversation ; delighted with his bed of pinks , devoted to his hares ; the least pretentious and the most lovable of England 's 18th Century poets . <P> Unhappily , the cheery peace of this literary sampler is broken by a scarlet thread that runs wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent every moment of his last 25 years under the delusion that God hated him personally . Worse yet , Cowper 's God was irrevocably determined to betray him at every turn in this life , and to torture him eternally in the next . Under this ghastly sentence , Cowper wretchedly took up , as he said , " the arduous task of being merry by force . " He found temporary oblivion in lighthearted verse and in thousands of eloquent , cheerful letters to his friends . <P> Mark Van Doren 's excellent selection of Cowper 's letters , pieced out with biographical sections , tells the heartbreaking story of this gentle , tormented genius . <P> Apocalyptic Visions .

Next year he took another severe shock when he was thrown to the young lions of an English boarding school . In sporting tradition , stronger boys mauled the weakling thoroughly , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to have had . William apparently made his " adjustment " by repressing his fear and shame and hatred . At any rate , when he was 21 , and a law student in London , fear and shame and hatred came roaring up through his mind so powerfully and unexpectedly that they toppled his reason , and for several months he lived in a lunatic depression . <P> Eleven years later , in 1763 , while preparing for civil service exams ( and perhaps despairing over the end of his first and last romance ) , Cowper went out of his mind again . This time , convinced that God had damned him " below Judas , " he tried three times to kill himself . Two years later , with his obsession relieved but not gone , he banished himself for life to the country . For the next 35 years , at a succession of small houses in the country north of London , he lived in semi-seclusion , an " odd scrambling fellow " in a bright blue coat who pottered amiably about-now mending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbling at a taboret in the greenery.
