At baseball 's midseason mark last week , the big news was the resurgent Boston Red Sox . Moving in against the first-place Chicago White Sox for a four-game series , the Red Sox needed to win three to take the league lead . They did , but only after playing one of the longest , most exciting marathons in baseball history . <P> Some 50,000 fans sat on the edge of their seats for the first game , which the Red Sox finally won , after staving off Chicago 's two-run rally in the ninth inning . Clyde Vollmer , the least celebrated member of Boston 's all-star outfield , won the game with a seventh-inning home run . Score : 3-2 . The second game was even tighter . At the end of nine innings the score was 4-4 . Not until the 17th inning , the longest night game in American League history , did the Red Sox win , 5-4 . The man who drove in the winning run : Clyde Vollmer . <P> Next night the incredible happened : after 18 innings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-2 . In the first half of the 19th , the Red Sox scored two runs . But the White Sox came storming back with three and won the game , 5-4 . It had taken the teams a record 36 innings to settle two successive games. * After that glorious comeback , the limp Chicago fans expected their heroes to sweep the fourth game for an even break . The White Sox led , 2-1 , going into the ninth , but lost , 3-2 . The buster-upper : Clyde Vollmer . It was the sixth time in seven games that he had knocked in the winning run . <P> The Red Sox , pre-season pennant favorites with the majority of baseball writers , were finally beginning to act as advertised . Vollmer 's sensational spree was not the whole story : the Red Sox have power to spare with Williams , Vern Stephens , and Billy Goodman , the league batting champion . The team is better off this year in " bench " ( i.e. , reserve ) infield strength supplied by Lou Boudreau , deposed Cleveland manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most , Boudreau has sparked the Red Sox at bat and afield . <P> Said Manager Steve O'Neill after the tight Chicago series : " The whole team has that desire to win and they 're hustling and fighting all the way . They feel they belong on top-and that 's where they hope to stay . " <P> <P> * Previous record : 33 innings , by the N. Y. Yankees , against the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians , in 1918.
