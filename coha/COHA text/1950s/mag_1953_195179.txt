THE BIRDS AND THE BEES ( 244 pp ) James Aswell-Rinehart ( $3 ) . <P> <P> A rung or so below the problem novel on fiction 's ladder stands the predicament novel . This type of fiction might also be called soup opera , since the hero or heroine usually gets in the soup in the first chapter and does n't get out till the last . Soup-opera books have a further important characteristic : after modest-sized editions in hard covers , they go quickly into huge editions in paperback-and become the reading of millions . The Birds and the Bees by James Aswell is a typical sample of the species . <P> Novelist Aswell 's heroine , Rowdy , is rich , sweet , 17 , and belongs to the want-to-be-lost generation . She is engaged to a handsome home-town boy ( Rivermark , La. ) who sells insurance and is as safe and sane as the Fourth of July without firecrackers . When he introduces her to a poetry-quoting New Orleans gambler , Randy Blane , Rowdy feels the " dark downbeat witchery " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Gambler Randy shows up outside Rowdy 's window with a bullet wound in his upper arm and a plea of " Hide me " on his lips . A Congressman 's son has been killed in a shooting brawl , and Randy is sure he will be tagged with the rap . Rowdy not only hides him , she takes charge of his getaway by car and speedboat . <P> As the plot thickens , Randy sickens . When his fever hits 104 , the runaways hole up with a heroin-peddling doctor who shoots Randy full of antibiotics . Randy recovers , but , at 39 , he is sure that all of life 's dice are loaded ; he has little faith in second chances , especially sexy ones . He advises Rowdy to go home to her insurance salesman , which indeed she does , but not before she sees Randy cut down in a hail of bullets . <P> In spots , Author Aswell catches the seamy side of his native Delta country pretty well . But most of the time , The Birds and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well-not the library shelf but the drugstore rack .
