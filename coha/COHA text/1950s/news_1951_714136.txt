txt Along about 1890 some chicken pickers employed by a poultry merchant in Bourbon struck for higher wages . Until last Aug , 17 , it was the only strike in the town 's century long history . Most residents of the quiet rural village of 1,200 wish it had been the last . The noisy struggle in progress now between the Joyner corporation , manufacturer of radio and television parts , and the CIO United Auto Workers has created tensions Bourbon never has known before . It has divided families , alienated lodge brothers , and split church congregations . U 's a Bad Thing Sam Lemler , a retired storekeeper , was sitting in front of A 's lunch , beer , and wine shop swapping yarns ' with his cronies when a reporter asked him about the strike . " It 's bad for the town , " said Sam , shaking his head . One of his pals squirted tobacco juice on the curb so he could open his mouth to speak . " It 's costing the merchants a lot of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part . ner in fox squirrel hunting expeditions , said : " This town 's too lath for unions . Those women should bs glad they had jobs . They didn ' have any till Joyner came here . " " I 'm not taking sides , " salt Sam . " After all , there are twt sides to everything . Now , my wift knows this for a fact : there wert women on that assembly line getting 80 cents an hour , and right beside them were other worrier getting maybe $1.20 an hour foi the same work . That ai n't right . " The tobacco chewer shifted his cud . " No , sir , " he said , " there ai n't nothin ' fair about that . " Unions Mean Strikes R. A. Keller , who runs a hardware store , said most of the people regretted the strike . He added that he did n't think it would have a very serious adverse effect on busi " I hear Joyner Charles E. Joyner , president of the corporation has put his plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hurt business some , but we got along before without it and probably we can again . " I ca n't afford to take sides in a dispute like this , and , anyway , it had to come eventually , even to little towns like this . Many years ago the American people , by their votes , showed that they wanted unions and when you have unions there 's bound to he strikes . " This strike is a symptom of the changing times . Maybe most of the folks in Bourbon do n't like the change ; I do n't know , but there is n't much we can do about it . " Floyd Hines , president of the Business Men 's association , said the association had adopted a neutral position in the strike . The only action the association has taken , he said , was to adopt a resolution requesting both sides to es  --  mi ei eriniPTIOP . Threatening Practices Stopped This resolution was voted in the early days of the strike ' When some of the strikers followed corporation officials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insults . at . them and stopped motorists and pedestrians who tried to enter the area around the plant , " We figured that in America a citizen should have the right . to use public streets and sidewalks without being molested , " Hines - said , " and those practices were stopped . " Tovmfolk generally were unwilling to speak for publication ' concerning the roles of Gov . Schricker and Sherif Harvey Phillips in the strike . Joyner has accused both of failure to give him police protection so that members of his.working force who are not members of the union and are not etriking can return to work in safety . Each has refused to take action , altho Circuit Judge Alvin F. Marsh has issued an injunction against picketing that denies access to the buildings . They 'll Speak at Polls " We 'll : - do our talking to the governor and the sherif at the ipolls , " said one Bourbon civic leader . Both are Democrats . This community has had considerable Democratic voting strength since the early days of the New Deal , tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The Democratic voting strength also may be due to the fact that some of the early settlers came from Kentucky . It is said that the town was named by a Kentuckian whose foundest recollection of the state he left was the whisky distilled there . While the strikers-90 per cent of them women  --  had the good will and sympathy of many townsfolk early in the strike , Reese H. Price , publisher of the Bourbon News-Mirror , believes they have alienated many of them now . " When the union deliberately violated the injunction , a lot of people turned against it , " he said . " After all , this is a country where most people respect the law . It seemed to many that when they went to court with their dispute and the court ruled on it , the union had an obligation to obey the decision . " Distresses Whole Town The strike has been particularly distressing to Bourbon townsfolk because the women on strike ? housewives , mothers , widows , and girls  --  have friends , relatives , or neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everybody knows . The corporation , on the other hand , is a newcomer from Chicago , tho it had been welcomed to Bourbon . The town gave Joyner a five acre site for a new plant after his first factory burned in 1947 . Joyner , a ' big , hard driving go-getter , has been both admired and envied for his enterprise and success . He started on a shoestring in Chicago in 1943 . He came , to Bourbon in 1945 hoping to expand his business where building and production costs and taxes are lower . His wife grew up in nearby Plymouth . His business boomed . Sales doubled in every year from 1943 until 1950 . His factory was riding the crest of the television industry prosperity . His - payroll increased until it totaled 11A. million dollars last year . He opened branch plants in Warsaw and Rochester . Slump , Then Union This spring the television business ? slumped . Scores of women were laid off . A number of them had brothers or husbands working in automobile parts plants in Plymouth , South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they formed a local union in the UAW . They won an NLRB election for recognition last April and opened negotiations for a contract . Many townsfolk are agreed that the women never would have organized if they had not been led and pushed by organizers of the UAW . One Woman 's Story Women on the picket line , altho they admit they were helped by the men from nearby UAW locals , contend , however , that they were driven into the union by Joyner . Mrs. Hilda Shearer of 207 W. Sunset dr. , a worker in the plant for four years , said Joyner strode up and down the aisles in the plant shouting and cursing at the women to make them work faster . She said that altho she was paid 80 cents an hour , other women with less experience and not producing more than she , got up to $1.25 . Mrs. Shearer is a widow and has been supporting her five children since her husband died four years ago . She had her youngest child , Linda , 5 , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Sarah Feldman , daughter of John Borden , a farmer whose land adjoins the plant on the west side , is the wife of an army private at Camp Chaffee , Ark. ; Mrs , Ernest Wagner , rural route 5 , Plymouth , is the mother of three children and wife of a UAW member c the McCord corporation local in Plymouth . The others were Mrs. Ruth Leiter of . Bremen , a hamlet 15 miles north of here , and Mrs. Edith Jackson of 313 W. Center st.
