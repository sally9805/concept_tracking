DOWN THERE ( La-Bas ) ( 317 pp. ) - Joris- Karl Huysmans , translated by Keene Wallis - University Books ( $5 ) . <P> " With his hooked paw. the Devil drew me toward God , " wrote a crazy mixed-up Frenchman named Joris-Karl Huysmans . He was never so crazy as when he earnestly took up diabolism . The record of his descent to the depths among the witches and warlocks of Paris was written in the first year of the ' 90s , and nothing more appalling appeared in the rest of that de cadent decade . L-Bas , now republished in the U.S. , might well call to the mind of old-fashioned readers Browning 's : <P> . . . my scrofulous French novel <P> On gray paper with blunt type ! <P> Simply glance at it , you grovel <P> Hand and foot in Belial 's gripe . <P> The hero of L-Bas is a novelist named Durtal , who is doing research into the monstrous life of Gilles de Rais , often mistaken for the original Bluebeard. *A dedicated researcher , Durtal himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced- for De Rais , found guilty of murder and executed in 1440 , seems to have attracted disciples in 19th century Paris . The core of their infamy is the bizarre and blasphemous rite known as the Black Mass , in which every imaginable obscenity is committed and the Eucharist itself is invoked to bring the celebrants closer not to God but to Satan . <P> This odd narrative begins with a conversation between the Novelist-Hero Durtal and a learned physician . Des Hermies . The friends go to the tower cell of a saintly but simple character - the bellringer of Saint-Sulpice Church - where they dine and talk about theology . It all sounds very dull , and Durtal is not far off the mark when he confides that his book about Gilles de Rais will be " as tedious to read as to write . " But Durtal 's affair with the seductive Hyacinthe - widow of a manufacturer of chasubles and wife of an au thor of religious biographies - might be enough to put L-Bas off the public shelves of most libraries . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presided over by an unfrocked priest . ( Both the weird wife and the de frocked priest were drawn from life by Author Huysmans . ) <P> Bluebeard &; Bluenose . Ever since it first appeared serially in Echo de Paris , the book has enjoyed a kind of scandalous celebrity among men of letters . Zola attacked Huysmans ; Maupassant , Verlaine and others defended him . In 1924 , the present publishers report , L-Bas was is sued in the U.S. but ran afoul of John S. Sumner , industrious secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Vice . Publisher Albert Boni agreed to withdraw the book and destroy the plates . Now , a generation later , readers may well be of two minds as to who had the right of the matter - the celebrated bluenose or the historian of " Bluebeard . ' ' At any rate , those who look to the book for bits of cheerful pornography will be disappointed . Satanism is dismal stuff , and blasphemy meaningless to those who do not believe in the things blasphemed against . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his book .
