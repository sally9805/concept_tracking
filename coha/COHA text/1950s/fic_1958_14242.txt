When the dynamic and sprightly overture is finished , the LIGHTS in the amphitheatre go down and out . There is an instant of DARKNESS , and then with a MUSICAL SALUTE a SPOTLIGHT comes up at the Right Front of the Center Stage , revealing the CHAPLAIN standing there . He is a middle-aged clean-shaven cheerful man , dressed in clerical Confederate gray , with a gray field-coat draped over his shoulders and carrying a round-brimmed black hat in his hand . Looking out at the audience he speaks with energy and sincere directness . He is the narrator in the play . THE CHAPLAIN ( As the MUSIC makes a few soft chords of accompaniment ) We are met tonight to memorialize a great event in the life of this nation  --  the tragic and terrible civil war of a hundred years ago . And it is proper and right that we gather here on the historic soil of Virginia in so doing  --  mother in other days of presidents and statesmen . ( The MUSIC ends . ) Our play opens on an April night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mighty struggle has not yet begun but soon it will break in all its fury across the land . The long and growing difference between the North and the South over tariff , states rights , slavery and even customs of living has reached the stage of bitterness where reason and persuasion can no longer prevail and the age-old and passionate resort to arms will be tried . Already seven states have seceded from the Union and set up their separate Confederate government . The new president Abraham Lincoln has called for an army of volunteers to force them to return . In the crisis a number of United States anny officers from different parts of the country have been recalled by the government , among these Colonel Robert E. Lee commanding the First Cavalry . On this particular night Lee has been summoned from the hospitality of his beautiful old Virginia home of Arlington just across the Potomac River from the capital to meet with a spokesman of the president-one Judge William Barrett . And there  --  ( Gesturing toward the Left. )  --  he is to be faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to involve his life and the lives of others in ways strange beyond his believing . ( The SPOTLIGHT fades out from the CHAPLAIN and rises at the Left Front of the Center Stage , disclosing the interior of a room in the war office in Washington . It is a rather plain place with a desk at the Right , a window at the Center Rear and a chair or two about . By the desk is an upright United States flag on its staff . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT is seated at the desk finishing a letter . A number of documents are piled around and before him . In the distance intermittent CHEERING , YELLING and SINGING of a celebrating people are heard . The JUDGE in appearance is what used to be called a fine figure of a man . He is heavy-set , carries a surplus of stomach and wears thick graying sideburns , with his dome of bald head rising up between them like a bare field-stone between two bushes of hairy furze . He is dressed in rich black broadcloth and is obviously a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears at the Right. ) p. 3 CLERK ( In announcement ) Colonel Robert E. Lee is here . ( BARRETT nods . He signs and seals the letter and hands it to the CLERK . ) JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Rising ) Get this to the Secretary of War at once . And remind him for the record that the President and I will meet him at the White House for dinner . ( The CLERK takes he letter and hurries away . LEE enters and BARRETT goes to meet him with extended hand . In his booming yet gravelly voice . ) Delighted to see you , Robert , delighted . ROBERT E. LEE ( Simply ) I am glad to see you , Judge Barrett . ( They shake hands . LEE is at this time fifty-four years old and wears the uniform of a colonel of the United States Cavalry with sash and sword . He is a noble and handsome man , in the full prime of his life  --  straight and athletic , strong-shouldered , with frank and open countenance , dark hair and kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trim-cut military moustache which is beginning to show glintings of gray . His baring is that of a grave and disciplined soldier . ) JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT You are looking well , Robert  --  your army life , Texas , all that  --  kept you tuned up no doubt . And now you are back in the bosom of your family at Arlington . p. 4 ROBERT E. LEE And devoutly glad to be there  --  and in the spring . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT And my daughter Jessica and my son Pat ? I trust they are behaving themselves under your roof . ROBERT E. LEE I left the young people singing and enjoying themselves  --  forgetting these unhappy troubles . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Abruptly as is his way ) I had a conference with Mr. Lincoln and General Winfield Scott this morning . ( With a touch of self  --  unction . ) You may know I played some part in Lincoln 's election to his high office . And as a friend of his and an old friend of yours I count myself most fortunately placed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a great political power now , William  --  a first citizen of Virginia . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Clasping his pudgy hands beneath his coat-tail ) True , I have built up some power as well as wealth , but by hard work , hard work and never say die . ( Chuckling and turning about the room . ) You remember how as boys together there at that Quaker school in Alexandria we used to talk about what we wanted to be . You once planned to be a school-teacher , I recall , like poor old Mr. Leary. p. 5 ROBERT E. LEE ( A little strongly ) Mr. Leary was a fine and good man , William . I will never forget his teachings . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT He used to say to me  --  " William , " he would say , " you would make a fine preacher . " ( He laughs . ) Me a preacher ! ROBERT E. LEE Yes , perhaps neither of us has measured up to Mr. Leary 's expectations . Necessity made me a soldier , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT And good horse sense made me a business man . You should have gone into partnership with me , Robert  --  grown rich . You have a big family to support . ( The SINGING and CHEERING of the people are heard again passing along a distant street but nearer this time . BARRETT gestures toward the window . ) The whole of Washington is happy over the president 's proclamation . All day the people have been celebrating  --  singing , cheering , making speeches , shooting firecrackers , building bonfires . Listen . ROBERT E. LEE It is better a time of mourning  --  with our country breaking in two the way it is . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Abruptly again ) I 've always cherished your friendship , Robert . ( Buoyantly . ) And now I am in a position to repay it . ( LEE looks at him in silence . ) You have been in the United States army for over thirty years . p. 6 ROBERT E. LEE I have . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Thirty years  --  ( He begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting Indians , Mexicans , marching in burning deserts , in freeze and flood , fording streams , climbing mountains , shaking the ice out of your shoes in the morning , harnessing rivers , setting up army posts , forts , building the nation  --  ( Bringing his hands together with a clap of emphasis. )  --  serving the Union . ( Turning suddenly and pointing his finger at him . ) And now you see this Union you have loved and served threatened with destruction . ROBERT E. LEE I still pray that some miracle may happen to bring both sides to their senses . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT So did Daniel Webster , Henry Clay and even this renegade Jefferson Davis pray  --  pray and work for more than twenty-five years , and all the while the cleavage widened . ROBERT E. LEE When your message of authority summoned me , William , I hurried here hoping the President had some plan to propose in this quarrel . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT And he has , Robert . He and I feel there is yet a chance to escape a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's true . p. 7 JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Lifting his hand in monition ) A chance . Or if war does come to make it brief and without the spilling of much blood . ( Hurrying on . ) Your family is old and honorable in the history of Virginia . The Lees more than any others have helped make the state , make the nation . Your kinsmen , Richard Henry Lee , Arthur Lee , your own valiant father , Lighthorse Harry Lee  --  statesmen all . You have married into the family of George Washington and in character you are like Washington  --  you are , Robert . ( Lee makes a gesture of embarrassment . ) Oh , I know you are the most modest man alive . But your voice at this moment has great weight in Virginia . And with my voice added to yours and both of us working closely with President Lincoln  --  ROBERT E. LEE I am only a soldier , Judge Barrett , not a politician . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT But as a soldier and man you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in the Union , her prestige and power will perhaps discourage the border states  --  North Carolina , Kentucky , Arkansas , Tennessee and others , from going out . Then from economic and commercial necessity if for no other reason , the cotton states will gradually return to the fold . ROBERT E. LEE I have hoped so with all my heart . p. 8 JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT The majority of opinion is for the Union and  --  ROBERT E. LEE ( Interrupting ) It was until a few days ago . The President 's calling on Virginia to furnish troops against her sister states was , I think , unfortunate . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT But after the firing on Sumter he had to act . ROBERT E. LEE He had already acted in provoking that firing . I am speaking frankly , William . The influence of the radicals has been too great with him . And if he invades the South there will be no escaping a bloody war . ( Barrett turns and plants himself in front of Lee , giving him an appraising look from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brimming and beaming are ever crafty and watchful . ) JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT This army President Lincoln is raising , Robert , is not an army for war . No , but a great land and naval power that will help to guarantee the peace , a force so strong that the seceding states will not dare oppose it . ( With Platform impressiveness . ) He authorizes me to ask you to head that army . ( Lee looks at him in shocked surprise , dismay settling in his face . ) What Mr. Lincoln needs now most of all is a good general , and you would be that . General Scott says you 're the best man in the military service . The news that you are the new Federal commander-in-chief could be telegraphed to Richmond tonight where the convention is in a turmoil . It would have great effect . It could go with your appeal to withhold action  --  and then your immediate appearance before that body with me would , I believe , keep the state in line . It is only a chance but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lee is silent an instant . ) Do n't refuse this offer , Robert . This is the great hour of your career . Look through the window there . A mighty monument is going up to the man we all honor , George Washington . He was the father of this country . Now in the testing time of our democracy , its darkest hour , you have the chance to become the country 's preserver . Do so and your name will be honored forever . You will be the next president . I promise you now I will use my full influence for that . In time another great monument will rise to honor you . ( Lee stares ahead of him . ) But if you stand aside and do not lift a hand to help  --  p. 9 ROBERT E. LEE ( Heavily ) A soldier can not stand aside . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Exactly . ( He grips his hands across his stomach and gazes straight at Lee . ) The president is asking for your help . The nation is asking for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see that the threat of an armed invasion is the way to peace . A union pinned together by bayonets is no union . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( With a touch of anger ) But how else can it be held together now ? ROBERT E. LEE I do not know . Perhaps it can not be held together now . And better a thousand times that the South be allowed to depart in peace than to have civil war . And that is all she asks , William  --  to depart in peace . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Roughly ) You would let the Union be torn in two ? ( Lee says nothing . ) Lincoln will never agree to that . ( He turns toward the window . The SHOUTING and SINGING of the people now draw nearer . The LIGHT FADES DOWN a bit on the scene and COMES UP along the incline at the Right . A raggle-taggle procession of PEOPLE , citizens young and old , are moving Down toward the Right Center Stage , carrying banners and signs with captions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Down with the Sesesh , " " Free the Slaves " and the like and are singing in a great wash of sound the " John Brown 's Body " song . BARRETT and LEE stand listening to the milling roaring crowd passing by. ) p. 10 PEOPLE John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the grave , John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the grave , John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the grave , &nbsp; &nbsp; His soul goes marching on . ( The People turn Down into the darkness at the Right . ) Glory , glory , hallelujah , Glory , glory , hallelujah , Glory , glory , hallelujah , &nbsp; &nbsp; His soul goes marching on . VOICES The Union forever ! Lincoln ! Abe Lincoln ! OTHER VOICES Lincoln ! Lincoln ! ( The SINGING and YELLING gradually die away . The LIGHT FADES from the incline and COMES UP full again in the office . BARRETT gives his chuckle and nods toward the window . ) JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT " John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy fanatic at Harper 's Ferry two years ago and started him on his way to the gallows you little thought you were making him into a dead hero . ( Half-humming . ) " His soul goes marching on . " ROBERT E. LEE Yes , and like the angel of death , I fear , flying over our poor land with drenchings of blood in his wings . So does one evil add to another . It was a mistake to hang the old man . p. 11 JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT President Lincoln is waiting , Robert . ROBERT E. LEE ( Intensely , earnestly ) If by my acceptance of his great offer I felt I could help this unhappy situation I would not hesitate whatever the cost to me and mine . But I fear my very acceptance would only anger the South the more and so lead further toward disaster . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Still , you do not know . ROBERT E. LEE No , no , I do not know . ( Pushing his hand across his forehead . ) It 's all confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , I can not see . But I can not accept this offer now . Not now . ( His voice dies away and he throws out his hands as if helplessly . Then he jerks up his head and stares off . ) If only the President could be persuaded to patience . ( He looks around at BARRETT . ) In the light of his confidence expressed in me , perhaps I could do one thing . ( Eagerness breaking in his voice . ) Yes , go to him and plead with him , beg him  --  to wait , wait  --  to hold back these soldiers from invasion  --  then there yet might be a chance for peace . There might be . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Sternly ) But Lincoln has taken an oath under the constitution to preserve the Union . p. 12 ROBERT E. LEE ( Almost vehemently ) The Bible says even unto seventy times seven we should forgive and try and try again that the right may prevail . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Satirically ) Lifting a righteous sword would better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no good to go to Lincoln . He too is a stubborn man . ROBERT E. LEE ( Now as if carrying on his puzzling thoughts to himself ) But if I went to him in this uniform and he as president and commander-in-chief ordered me to a course of action against my conscience then I 'd be forced to resign under orders  --  resign in dishonor . A good soldier could never do that . Could he , William ? ( Shaking his head . ) No , I must have time to consider , time to think . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Harshly ) Then think it through if you must . And in mercy 's name let us have good news in a few hours . ( He flings up his hand . ) But hear me , and this is no threat to try to persuade you . No matter what happens I believe the majority of the people in Western Virginia will side with Lincoln , even if it means invasion of the South . I believe they will remain loyal to the Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them so . p. 13 ROBERT E. LEE ( Aghast ) You would try to tear Virginia in two ? JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT I would . I do not hesitate to do my duty . I show you how much I love the Union . ROBERT E. LEE ( Coldly , staring at him ) No , William , it is not love of the Union  --  it is love of your precious factories and machinery and railroads and the mighty profits you make from them . You too have betrayed the nation 's heritage and joined the horde of Yankee money-grubbers . ( Quickly , as BARRETT starts to interrupt . ) And let me tell you it is this blind grasping for profit and power that is mainly responsible for the breaking of this nation . In our greed we have lost the dream of our forefathers . And unless a divine providence has mercy upon us , this sin can only be washed away in the blood of innocent thousands of young men dead . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Controlling himself ) Your accusations do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on facts . And the facts are this greedy North you speak of , these money-grubbing Yankees are the real creators of this country and have been for many a year . They are busy building bridges , roads , harbors , towns , creating , making a strong and powerful republic , while the poor misguided South still clings asleep to its faded aristocracy and its slaves , creating nothing . ( The CLERK comes in with a message which he hands to BARRETT , then goes . BARRETT reads the message . His face sets in grim lines . ) From the Secretary of War . ( Reading aloud . ) " We have just learned the Virginia convention in secret session today voted to secede from the Union . " ( LEE springs over , takes the message and looks at it ) p. 14 ROBERT E. LEE ( With a groan ) Now may God help our poor land ! JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Sharply ) God has nothing to do with it , but you and I do . Your country needs you more than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. LEE And bitter is the news I carry to my poor wife and the young people waiting at Arlington . ( Vaguely . ) I am sorry . ( He turns and goes on out at the Right . BARRETT stands a moment gazing after him and then hurries away to the Left . The SINGING and SHOUTING of the people are heard passing along again outside . The scene FADES OUT . A few notes of a strident MILITARY BUGLE sound in the distance off to the Right . Then far in the darkness at the Rear a ROCKET goes soaring up the sky bursting there in trickles of splattered colored lights and descending through the night to the sound of CHEERING . The LIGHT rises dimly on the Right Front of the Center Stage , revealing the parade of the PEOPLE now crossing the scene toward the Left , shouting and singing and prancing about as before . LEE comes along in the middle foreground from the Left Rear . He stops and regards the turmoil of excited citizens . ) PEOPLE We are coming , Father Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Abraham , &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Union to restore . ( The PEOPLE move up and around LEE and begin to circle him as in the children 's game , " Ring Around the Rosy . " They continue their song . ) If you look across the hilltops &nbsp; &nbsp; That meet the Northern sky , Long moving lines of rising dust &nbsp; &nbsp; Your vision may descry.And now the wind an instant tears &nbsp; &nbsp; The cloudy veil asideAnd floats aloft our spangled flag &nbsp; &nbsp; In glory and in pride . ( The PEOPLE break off at a tangent and move diagonally away into the darkness at the Left Rear , continuing their song as they go . ) And bayonets in the sunlight gleam , &nbsp; &nbsp; And bands brave music pour.We are coming , Father Abraham , &nbsp; &nbsp; Three hundred thousand more.We are coming , Father Abraham , &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Union to restore . ( With beating DRUM a squad of Union SOLDIERS spick and span , their rifles glistening in the light , comes marching across from Right to Left in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE stands at attention and salutes the flag . The SERGEANT returns his salute , and the SOLDIERS disappear into the shadows at the Left Front . In the distance the PEOPLE are heard shouting and making their racket. ) p. 15 VOICES War , war ! Fight , fight ! OTHER VOICES Fight , fight ! War , war ! ( LEE stands an instant listening and then lifts his hand in a half-helpless gesture and lets it fall . He goes rapidly off at the Right Front , the LIGHT fading behind him . The MUSIC reprises a few bars of the song and dies . In the darkness up the incline at the Right the voice of BUCK MACINTOSH is heard . ) BUCK 'S VOICE ( Singing ) Old Joe Clark killed a man , &nbsp; &nbsp; Buried him in the sand , Old Joe Clark 's gon na be hung , &nbsp; &nbsp; Ai n't no other man . ( The LIGHT comes up there showing BUCK MACINTOSH stepping along through the night . He is a stalwart rawboned man of forty  --  five or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and is dressed in an old field shirt , earth  --  stained work trousers , heavy walking shoes , and a coonskin cap the tail of which drapes down behind one of his ears . He carries a long  --  barrelled deer rifle in one hand and with the other holds a tow sack half filled with bedding hung over his shoulder . ) Fare you well , old Joe Clark , &nbsp; &nbsp; Fare you well , I 'm gone , Fare you well , old Joe Clark , &nbsp; &nbsp; Goodbye , Betsy Brown . ( LEE emerges from the , darkness on his way home , meeting him . He and BUCK pass on by each other , BUCK 'S song continuing . ) Old Joe Clark had a wife , &nbsp; &nbsp; He set her on the shelf , I took her down and kissed her twice &nbsp; &nbsp; And clumb up there myself . ( He stops , springs around and lets out a whoop . ) Captain Bob Lee ! ( LEE looks back . The LIGHT widens to enclose them both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as life or you can feed me to the shoats ! Buck MaCintosh , sir . ( He drops his gun and tow bag on the ground and grabs LEE 'S hand in both of his. ) p. 16 ROBERT E. LEE ( His eyes twinkling ) Buck MaCintosh , bless my soul ! Of all the folks in the world ! BUCK MACINTOSH Yes sir , the same that used to fetch water for you and the men down there at Fortress Monroe when you were a building of it , all in the muck and mud . ROBERT E. LEE I 'd never expect to see you here in Washington , Buck . BUCK MACINTOSH Aye sir , ' t is a wild and fearful place to be in . I come up here to sell my winter 's catch of coon and other hides . And I got to get on towards Norfolk tonight . ROBERT E. LEE ( Firmly ) Not tonight , Buck . You 're going home with me to Arlington . We 'll find a bed for you . BUCK MACINTOSH Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out tending my traps . Well , sir , I 'd like to see the missus and the family . ROBERT E. LEE And they 'd love to see you . Come along , man . ( BUCK picks up his gun and tow sack and they go on up the incline together . The scene FADES OUT , and immediately from the darkness toward the Rear the sound of YOUNG MEN 'S AND WOMEN 'S VOICES is heard brightly singing the old Southern favorite love song , " Lorena , " accompanied by a PIANO . ) VOICES The years creep slowly by , Lorena , The snow is on the grass again  --  ( The LIGHT comes up on the Center Stage. ) p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 The drawing-room at Arlington mansion , the home of COLONEL and MRS . ROBERT E. LEE  --  a tasteful place in its Georgian woodwork and paneling , lovely furniture and draperies . We see it at an angle . At the Right Center is a window with golden curtains and at the Left Rear a door leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front is a table . On the wall to the Right of the door hangs C. W. Peale 's portrait of George Washington as a Virginia colonel of militia , with the Virginia flag on one side and the United States flag on the other . Just to the Right of the portrait is the piano , with an accordion resting on the floor by it . At the Right Front is a sideboard with tall unlighted candles . MARY LEE is at the piano with some ten or twelve handsomely dressed YOUNG PEOPLE grouped about her  --  among them her brother ROONEY with his young wife CHARLOTTE and the three sisters , ANNIE , AGNES , and MILDRED LEE . Also in the group are two or three Federal LIEUTENANTS and two cadets , LARRY WHITEHURST and RANDY HARRISON , these latter wearing the uniforms of the Norfolk Military Academy . CAPTAIN LUTHER MORRIS in the uniform of the United States army is standing near MARY . COUSIN BETTY MORELAND is leaning on the piano as she sings . STEPHEN WINSLOW is standing by JESSICA BARRETT with PAT BARRETT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT E. LEE is seated near the table at the Left knitting . DABNEY REGAN is standing in front of the Washington portrait studying it .

YOUNG PEOPLE ( Continuing their spirited singing ) The sun 's low down the sky , Lorena , &nbsp; &nbsp; The frost gleams where the flowers have been , For the heart throbs on as warmly now &nbsp; &nbsp; As when the summer days were nigh , Oh , the sun can never dip so low &nbsp; &nbsp; A-down affection 's cloudless sky .

LEE is a semi-invalid . She shows all of her fifty-three years in her tired but patient face , for she suffers much from rheumatism . Her gray hair is brushed smoothly back from her forehead and set off by a sort of kerchief lace cap pinned at the back , with its two snow-white flaps hanging down behind . The bright shawl about her shoulders contrasts with the dark silk dress she wears . A cane is leaning against her chair . ) COUSIN BETTY MORELAND ( Tearfully ) So sad and so beautiful !

STEPHEN is a good-looking young man , tall of figure , lean-faced and with dark gleaming eyes . In his manners and dress he is a true Virginia aristocrat , somewhat supercilious and selfish withal but well-bred enough to keep these qualities hid . He is about twenty-seven. ) p. 20 RANDY HARRISON Yes , but if war breaks out , Stephen , you wo n't be chasing foxes . You 'll be chasing  --  ( He suddenly stops . RANDY is a happy-hearted Southern boy , bright of face and with a sunny smile .

PAT BARRETT ( An athletic blond young man of twenty-three ) Now hold on there about Abraham Lincoln , Miss Betty . He 's our president , and going to make a good one . Father says so . COUSIN BETTY MORELAND Yes , and the Virginia people are disappointed in your father , Pat Barrett  --  him bedding up as you might say with that rail-splitter . Lincoln 's a black Republican , that 's what he is , born in a log cabin and with no more raising than a yard dog . He hates the South , its beauty and culture , and you know it . Poor white ! ( She fans herself suddenly with her handkerchief and appeals to ROONEY . ) He does , does n't he , Rooney Lee ? p. 22 ROONEY LEE ( A giant horseman of a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just music and  --  and friendship .

You have entertained him at your house in Washington , the Lord help me ! You know what he believes . JESSICA BARRETT From what Father says he does n't hate the South . ( JESSICA is a beautiful and energetic young woman of twenty-one with a tall and lithesome figure , magnificent dark hair and eyes  --  eyes from which little peeps of fun and sparkles of merriment show forth now and then from the rich fountain of her inner pulsing life . Her movements are rhythmical and joyous , her voice sweet and clear and her laugh spontaneous and free . She sings and dances well and is obviously the belle of the party . ) DABNEY REGAN ( Croaks out suddenly from the rear ) Lincoln loves the Union . ( He is an awkward somewhat thin-faced young man of twenty-five who speaks spasmodically and when among company never seems to know just what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom with his students he is a different fellow. ) p. 23 COUSIN BETTY MORELAND ( Snapping ) Same thing , Professor Regan . ( Staring at him . ) And what kind of politics do you teach your students in Norfolk ? DABNEY REGAN ( Gulping and then firing off his words ) Science is my politics  --  science the future liberator of mankind . In the new day it will free the world from poverty and war  --  something religion has not been able to do for all these thousands of years . Science ! That 's what I teach . COUSIN BETTY MORELAND Hnff ! I hear scientists are all atheists  --  do n't believe in God . Are you one of these new Darwin believers  --  think folks come from monkeys and all that ? ( DABNEY shrugs his shoulders and turns back to studying the portrait on the wall . ) MRS . ROBERT E. LEE Let Jessica sing for us . " Drink to me only with thine eyes "  --  sing that , Jessica .

The lovely dresses of the girls and the uniforms of the soldiers and cadets are set off to good color and advantage in the candle gleams as the young people turn about the room . The music LARRY plays is a little andante by Gluck . The couples are paired off  --  LUTHER with MARY , STEPHEN with JESSICA , RANDY with MILDRED , ANNIE with a young Federal LIEUTENANT , AGNES with PAT , ROONEY with his sweet-faced young wife CHARLOTTE , and COUSIN BETTY with the awkward DABNEY whom she has determinedly grabbed . DABNEY keeps looking at JESSICA and STEPHEN as they go floating by . The minuet is especially lovely and dynamic . MRS . LEE sits in her chair enjoying it . So does AUNT MIMEY . The dance continues and soon begins to build in energy and fervor . LARRY switches to the old folk-favorite tune of " John Anderson , My Jo .

And the girls with their dresses and flounces flying show in their pink cheeks and bright eyes the pleasure throbbing in their swinging rhythmic bodies . LEE and BUCK enter , the latter remaining somewhat in the background . LEE carries a yellow daffodil in his hand . The dance hesitates , dissolves , breaks , and some of the DANCERS turn to LEE . AUNT MIMEY who has risen and begun to cut a few stiff staccato steps cackles out . ) AUNT MIMEY Bless de Lawd , Marse Robert done got back . I ' fraid dat Yankee trash gwine layway you over dere .

( For an instant an evil little sense of antagonism is apparent in the room which a moment before was filled with warmth and friendly gaiety . ANNIE and AGNES move slightly away from the PARTNERS with whom they have been dancing . And even MARY looks dolefully at LUTHER an instant , turns her head and gazes off , the tears welling in her eyes . STEPHEN 'S hand goes out and takes JESSICA 'S arm in possessive firmness . She looks at him with her great dark eyes from which the sparkle has died . He smiles at her , but she does not smile .

MILDRED and RANDY follow them through the door into the hall , and LARRY joins them , carrying his accordion . ) PAT BARRETT ( To JESSICA ) Father will expect us to get back to Alexandria at once , Jessica .

LEE I must search to know my own heart . Come . ( He helps her away . The MUSIC reprises the andante in full harmony , and the scene FADES OUT . The LIGHT comes up somewhat faintly now on the Left Front of the Center Stage , revealing part of the flower and shrub garden at Arlington . At the Rear is an ivy  --  shrouded wall and in front of it an outdoor seat with a little path leading by it . The SPOTLIGHT now picks out a few eye-glimpse farewell scenes between the YOUNG PEOPLE .

This trouble will soon be over , and I 'll come back for you , Mary . p. 36 MARY LEE Yes , Luther . Yes . ( He pulls her to him . ) I 'll pray night and day that God will keep you safe .

For a moment she clings to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks quickly away down the garden path . The scene DIMS OUT , the MUSIC strengthens an instant and fades down again .

STEPHEN WINSLOW and JESSICA BARRETT have entered there . ) JESSICA BARRETT You are Father 's enemy now , Stephen . You said so . ( STEPHEN steps around in front of her and stops her . ) STEPHEN WINSLOW But I 'm not asking to marry your father . It 's you I want , Jessica . JESSICA BARRETT You must n't talk like that tonight . STEPHEN WINSLOW And I will talk like that tonight , because I love you . ( He takes her firmly by the shoulders . ) JESSICA BARRETT Please , please .

You 're going to be my wife , Jessica , hear me !  --  the most beautiful woman in all Virginia . And there in Winslow Hall you will be my queen  --  mistress over my home , my plantation , my slaves , over me . JESSICA BARRETT No , Stephen . I have no wish to be a queen . STEPHEN WINSLOW Like a soldier , beauty also has its noblesse oblige . And in you the proud heritage of the old South will be prouder still . ( DABNEY comes plunging awkwardly in at the Right . JESSICA wriggles away from STEPHEN . ) DABNEY REGAN ( The words stuttering from him ) I 've come to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my Norfolk school .

( He moves after her . The scene FADES OUT and the MUSIC comes in more strongly . The LIGHT rises again on the main part of the garden . The MUSIC stops as MILDRED enters running from the Right .

He kisses it and falls on his knees holding to her hand . ) I swear to be true to you . There will never be another woman in my life except Mildred Lee . I swear to be faithful unto her till  --  ( Searching for the right word. )  --  till the cows come home . ( She suddenly hugs his head against her. ) p. 39 MILDRED LEE ( Ecstatically ) Randy !

MACK 'S VOICE ( In the distance at the Left ) Here I is ! NANCY LEE Wait right there , child . Wait ! ( She goes loping off . As she passes into the shadows at the Left , the LIGHT widens up the incline showing BUCK gazing after her and chuckling as he shakes his old blanket in the air . The soft background MUSIC comes in again . ) BUCK MACINTOSH Yeh , she 's right about loving . Come the war fear and love sprouts and blossoms all over the place like a redbud tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off same as turtle doves in the hot days of May . Young folks , say I ?

( Sternly . ) Behave yourself , Buck , and think of your lowly but free condition . ( He spreads his blanket down on the ground , stretches and yawns . ) Aye , the soft hugging arms of a plump purty woman are wondrous things  --  but the jaws of a steel trap maybe are safer . ( He sits down on his blanket and stares off . ) Poor Colonel Bob Lee , I feel sorry for him  --  pondering and praying over the country , poor fellow , there in the house .

( He lays himself back and pulls the blanket over him . Almost immediately he begins to snore . The scene FADES OUT , and in the distance at the Rear the sound of HORSES ' HOOVES and CARRIAGE WHEELS is heard as the YOUNG PEOPLE drive away . The MUSIC continues for a moment and then dies . The LIGHT comes up once more on the interior of the Arlington drawing-room . LEE is seated at the table on which a single CANDLE is lighted . An open Bible is beside the candle . He is still dressed in his army uniform , though he has laid aside his sash and sword , and is wearing spectacles . He reads from the Bible. ) p. 40 ROBERT E. LEE " Sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy . Break up your fallow ground , for it is time to seek the Lord , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .

Show me the path I must go and guide my stumbling steps therein according to thy will . And whatever the cost , I pray thee give me strength to bear it all . Amen . ( He looks at the Bible again and then sits staring ahead of him . A discordant and twisted harmony of the " John Brown 's Body " song is heard in the music . LEE lifts his head as if listening , as if visualizing . ) Yes , Mr. Lincoln , I know your words  --  I hear you speaking , sir  --  but  --  ( A MISTY CIRCLE OF LIGHT comes up high at the Rear and there as if behind a scrim we see the vague gaunt form of ABRAHAM LINCOLN . ) VOICE OF LINCOLN ( In the sound track , the MUSIC subdued and continuing queerly as a sort of background ) Now , therefore I , Abraham Lincoln , president of the United States , in virtue of the power in me vested by the constitution and the laws , do hereby order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the Union within twenty days from this date or failing , suffer the consequences .

" ( The FIGURE fades out , and the MUSIC dies. ) p. 41 ROBERT E. LEE Ah , but what sort of Union , Mr. President  --  union for what ? Now it is a union of selfishness and greed  --  ( Striking the table with his hand. )  --  of power , might , the iron fist ! This is not my Union . I can not believe in it . ( He turns to the Bible , again reading . ) " For the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them , but the transgressor shall fall therein . " ( Earnestly . ) I believe that . Yes , the just shall walk , but the transgressors shall fall . The ways of the Lord ! And there is a way  --  a righteous way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscience that says so . And he who sins against it shall fall  --  yes , a just judgment upon him , like the deadfall of the grave .

The MUSIC comes in with a discordant twisted rendering of " Dixie . " LEE lifts his head as if listening , as if visualizing . ) The South must make her answer  --  the voice of Jefferson Davis affirming  --  ( The MISTY LIGHT comes up again as if behind a scrim and there we see the lean steely figure of JEFFERSON DAVIS. ) p. 42 VOICE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS ( In the sound track , the MUSIC continuing as before in a sort of background ) Whereas the North has proclaimed her intent to use force against us who have declared our peaceful purpose in our right and lawful separation from the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Confederate States of America in virtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution and the laws , do call forth the militia of the each and several Confederate states to defend our hearths and homes and our rights as free men .

" ( The FIGURE fades out and the MUSIC dies . ) ROBERT E. LEE The South will defend herself . She will fight . ( In his frustration he beats the table with measured rhythmic blows of his fist . Then he touches his coat . ) And as a Federal officer I would find myself having to lead troops against the South  --  find myself killing and laying waste  --  burning and destroying her cities and historic shrines . I could never do that . Merciful God ! ( Rising and pacing the floor again . ) And Virginia stands between the opposing sides . She has withdrawn from a belligerent Union , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It is not her hills , her fields , her homes . No , something else , Something more  --  her heart , her soul , what she stands for and has stood for over the years in the life of this republic , her purposes , her ideals ! Yes , the teachings of Washington , of Jefferson , of William Leary ! These I have served . ( Almost eagerly . ) I shall continue to serve them . Ah , Mother Virginia !

Presently the LIGHT comes up again at the extreme Right Front. ) p. 46 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 A room in the capitol building at Richmond . LEE , dressed in civilian clothes , is standing bareheaded in front of the PRESIDENT of the Virginia Convention , an elderly gentleman with an open document in his hands from which he is reading . By his side stands a YOUNGER MAN holding a silk and tasseled pillow before him with a scabbarded sword lying across it . Grouped in front and around them are some six or eight LEGISLATORS . The scene is highlighted around LEE and merges off into the darkness , giving the suggestion of other unseen legislators present . At the rear a window is dimly discerned .

The MUSIC stops. ) p. 47 ROBERT E. LEE ( Earnestly , his voice tinged with emotion ) Mr. President and gentlemen of the convention , I would have preferred your choice had fallen on an abler man . But trusting in Almighty God and an approving conscience and the aid of my fellow-citizens , I shall devote myself henceforth to the task you have set me .

The CHAPLAIN now in full vestments , is standing in front of the altar . A number of the CONGREGATION have already assembled . OTHERS are coming in from the Right and Left .

If everybody could shoot like you we 'd make away with McClellan 's army . BUCK MACINTOSH I was too quick on the trigger that time , Lieutenant Harrison .

RANDY HARRISON Well , right now General Lee 's asking men to enlist for three years . That 's what I 'm doing , Larry , when my time runs out . LARRY WHITEHURST You love the Confederacy all right . BUCK MACINTOSH Like all of us , he loves General Lee . I 'm signing up for three years too . But I want some action . RANDY HARRISON General Lee will move when he 's ready and then look out , old McClellan ! LARRY WHITEHURST But all the time McClellan gets stronger .

BUCK walks a way with them saying goodbye to little BOB LEE , then turns back , takes his rifle from the Boy at the parapet and resumes his stance . The SOLDIERS return to their places as before . COUSIN BETTY comes quickly in again . She goes over to BUCK , takes a bottle from her shawl and holds it out to him . ) COUSIN BETTY MORELAND Maybe I should n't , but I brought you some special medicine , Buck .

BUCK drops down on the ground and laps at the wasted liquor like a thirsty hound . DABNEY REGAN enters from the Right . He is dressed in a lieutenant 's uniform . ) DABNEY REGAN ( Saluting raggedly ) Major Winslow ! An order from General Lee .

The MUSIC and whistling fade away . The LIGHT comes up at the Right Front and we see a small encampment of FEDERAL SOLDIERS in a woods .

( GORDON puts his shoes on again , picks up his rifle and starts cleaning it . Some of the SOLDIERS lay themselves back on the ground looking up at the starry sky .

( The LIGHT dims slowly down on the scene and the singing passes into a low harmonious wordless humming . In the glimmering starlight a number of CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS , commanded by STEPHEN , come creeping up toward the encampment from the darkness at the Left . They stop and wait . Slipping down out of the shadows of the woods up at the Right a few other CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS are seen , led by RANDY . The MUSIC strikes a sudden warning sound as if for a signal , and with yells the two groups of CONFEDERATES charge into the scene . The PICKETS instantly are overpowered , and for a moment a brisk encounter takes place up in the edge of the woods with hand-to-hand fighting and the noise of CLASHING BLADES , WHISTLING BULLETS and YELLS from the soldiers mixed in with FIGHTING EFFECTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

LUTHER collapses to the ground .

RANDY hurries back to the MEN at the Rear and is seen giving them instructions about guarding and holding the outpost . The SCENE FADES out and the LIGHT comes up on the Left Front of the Center Stage revealing GENERAL LEE 'S tent in the background with a rough table in front of it . MACK is sitting on a box bent over snoozing . A lighted LANTERN is at his feet . GENERAL LEE with the Confederate generals JAMES LONGSTREET , STONEWALL JACKSON and JEB STUART comes down the incline from the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . He is bearded now and his whitish gray contrasts with the more youthful and luxuriant beards of the other three . LONGSTREET is a heavy , methodical man , deliberate and somewhat sardonic in his speech , but a good soldier . He is forty-one years old and is a major-general . JACKSON is lean of figure , pale of countenance above his beard , with thin hardish lips , aquiline nose and piercing eyes  --  a man of intense and inner-centered nervous energy . He is slouchy and somewhat awkward in his dress and manner . He also is a major-general . By contrast STUART is a gay sunny-souled young man . His beard makes him appear older than his twenty-nine years . He is a brigadier-general of cavalry and is given to striking dress  --  red lining for his gray cloak , a red flower in his lapel , and his peacock-plumed hat cocked to one side and pinned by a gilt star .

The CHAPLAIN stands in the shadow at the Left looking off in the direction the STRETCHER-BEARERS have carried LUTHER . LEE barks out . ) Light ! Light ! ( MACK jumps up , grabs the lantern and sets it on the table . Then he returns to his box and resumes his snoozing LEE gestures to the THREE GENERALS and they gather around him as he unrolls his map and spreads it out . ) Well , gentlemen , one thing is sure . We must hit McClellan before he hits us. p. 90 J. E. B. STUART I am ready to strike now . My men are r'aring to go . JAMES LONGSTREET ( Laconically ) And a lot of going they 'll have to do , Jeb Stuart , before we 're finished with McClellan . ROBERT E. LEE The Chickahominy river is the first of our concerns .

Agreed . DABNEY REGAN ( Enters and salutes LEE ) General Pickett is moving his men in . The line will be closed to the left , he hopes , by morning . ROBERT E. LEE Very good . ( DABNEY retires into the background and stands near MACK who has reseated himself on his box by the tent . ) Thus with a turning movement we would threaten McClellan 's line of communication and supply by way of the York River railroad . Then either he would have to move his full army north of the Chickahominy to withstand our attack or gather it together south of the river and seek a new base on the James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the James to see that he never reached it .

STONEWALL JACKSON One of the best . ROBERT E. LEE So we must put ourselves in his place . What would we do if we were attacked on the north ? STONEWALL JACKSON Start a counter-drive on the south of the river . ROBERT E. LEE We would . So , General Longstreet , you will have to be prepared here toward Gaines 's Mill . ( He touches the map . ) Then if he does not attack on the south , start with all speed toward Harrison 's landing and get there ahead of him . JAMES LONGSTREET Yes sir . WALTER H.

You 'll need it all right , General Jackson . ROBERT E. LEE ( A little grimly ) McClellan is slow to move . He also is slow to be moved . Next will be D. H. Hill 's division , then A. P. Hill , then your corps , General Longstreet . JAMES LONGSTREET Very well , sir . ROBERT E. LEE General Pendleton will have his batteries in reserve here by Frayser 's Farm .

The LIGHT comes up dimly at the Rear . The tent has been pulled away . In the half-light CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS are seen charging from the Left and Right and dashing back over the upper level parapet into the darkness as they rush to the attack .

At this instant PRESIDENT DAVIS , STEPHENS and BENJAMIN enter at the Left . ) JEFFERSON DAVIS Is it going well , General Lee ? ( LEE turns sharply around . ) ROBERT E. LEE ( Almost yelling ) Mr. President , this is a battle , not a cabinet meeting . JEFFERSON DAVIS I want to see  --  ROBERT E. LEE ( Shouting ) See  --  See ! A shell explodes here and you 're all dead men . I order you , sir , to go back to a place of safety at once . JEFFERSON DAVIS ( A little coldly ) Order ? p. 99 ROBERT E.

McClellan was pushed back , but by skillful maneuvering he reached the safety of the James River . The Confederate cause now took new inspiration under Lee . His genius as a military leader showed itself in full strength during the coming months , and his name became known throughout the world . Lincoln , who like many political men before him believed in his own military wisdom , tried one commander after another to match Lee  --  McDowell , then McClellan , then Hooker , then Halleck , then Burnside . But Lee with his dynamic lieutenants , Jackson , Longstreet , Stuart , Hill , Johnston , and Early beat them again and again  --  at Cedar Mountain , at Manassas a second time , and at Harper 's Ferry . But as one Federal Army was beaten another renewed its strength . And the drive to capture Richmond went on  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 at Fredericksburg , Lee struck Burnsides ' advancing army and drove him back across the Rappahannock with great loss . Following this victory , he hurried to Richmond to plead with Davis and his cabinet to take certain action that might win the war . ( The LIGHT fades from the CHAPLAIN and comes up on the Right Front of the Center Stage. ) p. 100 p. 101 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE 6 JEFFERSON DAVIS ' office in the capitol at Richmond . DAVIS is sitting at a table which is somewhat framed by two windows at the Rear , and with an upright Confederate flag on its staff to the Right and a Virginia flag to the Left . On the wall between the windows is a large portrait study of Thomas Jefferson . Several MEMBERS of the cabinet and congress , including STEPHENS and BENJAMIN , are standing about and sitting here and there . LEE is standing to the Right of the table and speaking passionately . DAVIS is suffering from neuralgia and now and then rubs his jaw with his hand . ROBERT E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have defeated those people again and again . But they still are in Virginia . They have devastated our state from the east to the west in these battles . We must have more men to drive them out once and for all . You have my memorandum on the slaves . JEFFERSON DAVIS I do . The cabinet has met . It has been laid before our congress . STEPHEN WINSLOW And no action taken . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN Nor likely to be , General Lee . You should know that , sir . ROBERT E. LEE And how should I know it , sir ? I do not fear death for myself . I shall continue to do my duty to the last drop of my blood . No man can do more , no man should do less . But I have no right to waste the lives of my brave men , and the time is perilously short . Already Grant and Sherman are attacking with tremendous power on the Mississippi , and if they beat Hood and Bragg they will start their ravaging of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will spare neither the sword nor the torch , and when he has desolated the South he will turn north , and Richmond will be caught between the two forces from the north and the south and be crushed . p. 102 JUDAH P. BENJAMIN I believe that is possible . JEFFERSON DAVIS Before that happens I will arm every boy and old man in Dixie . Our people will rise up in their mighty wrath and destroy the invader . ( He sucks his teeth and pummels his jaw . ) ROBERT E. LEE ( Continuing ) We must act swiftly to turn the tide of this war before Sherman can ever get loose . And the only way we can do it is with manpower . We must have manpower . I must in all honesty tell you what I think . I would be remiss in my duty not to . We have several times laid peace proposals before Mr. Lincoln . JEFFERSON DAVIS And all have been rejected . ROBERT E. LEE Because he believes in the end he shall beat us with superior forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentlemen , the defeat of Burnside is our greatest victory so far . Now is the hour to push it home . I can not do so with my weakened army . It must be strengthened . JEFFERSON DAVIS Every possible effort is being made , General Lee , to call up new recruits and provisions and supplies . The people are responding from the Gulf to the Potomac with all their will . ROBERT E. LEE But these are not enough , Mr. President . The blockade of our ports is still keeping us strangled . The iron-clad ships are no longer arriving from England to break the blockade so that supplies can come from abroad . And why , sir ? p. 103 JEFFERSON DAVIS The English government has temporarily halted all help , true . But only temporarily , I tell you . The English mill workers are beginning to go hungry . Riots are breaking out in the English cities of Manchester , Birmingham and elsewhere for lack of our cotton . The ships must begin building . England must recognize us as we hold on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROBERT E. LEE Gentlemen , when we began this war we did so with high hopes and high principles , I repeat , our cause is being blackened in the world because of one thing  --  slavery . JEFFERSON DAVIS General Lee , slavery is a touchous matter . ROBERT E. LEE ( Going on almost vehemently now ) You gentlemen remember I pleaded with you many months ago to take some stand on this evil , for the North was sure to do so . Now it is rumored Lincoln is preparing an Emancipation Proclamation . And that is the reason England is delaying . The moral sense of the English people has been aroused . We are being viewed as defenders of slavery . Is it too much to ask , sirs , that we whose cause is not only one of principle but of life and death should not be aroused in this matter ? I come to beg you that the slaves be enlisted in the army as soldiers . STEPHEN WINSLOW A nigger wo n't fight . p. 104 ROBERT E. LEE He will for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That . Let every man that serves as a soldier at the same time receive his freedom . ( Hurrying on . ) There are four million slaves in the South . More than half a million of them are capable of bearing arms . They can be trained . I promise you they will fight as well as any man . Color has nothing to do with it . JEFFERSON DAVIS Our Congress would not pass such a law , General Lee . ROBERT E. LEE If it knew that our independence depended on it , it would . Let you and your cabinet and committee members lay the matter strongly before our Congress . And I will go with you and urge to the best of my poor ability our duty in this cause . ( Striking his hands together , as is a habit he has . ) Duty , gentlemen ! If we refuse to do right  --  how can we hope to win by doing wrong ? JUDAH P. BENJAMIN You speak strongly , General Lee . VOICES He does , he does . I resent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT E. LEE ( His voice ringing out ) And we should also without delay make it known to the world that we are planning emancipation for the black man , emancipation for all the slaves , men , women , and children . We should get ahead of Lincoln in this . p. 105 VOICES Emancipation ? Impossible ! No , no , General Lee , you must be out of your mind . ROBERT E. LEE With this dark blot removed from our conscience our call for help would be heard . Warships would come from England . Supplies and munitions would come from England and France . So , gentlemen , we could win . JEFFERSON DAVIS And we shall yet win . These supplies shall yet come . ROBERT E. LEE You gentlemen are slaveholders . You could make an example , you could begin with your own slaves , enlist them , free them . STEPHEN WINSLOW Personally I would do it , I think we all might , but it would be madness to go before the Congress with such a proposition . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is impossible . ROBERT E. LEE I have freed my slaves . No one has impeached me . JEFFERSON DAVIS ( With a pinched smile ) You 're always an exception , General Lee . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN The whole South would repudiate us as a body . The states would secede from the Confederacy . It would be broken apart , and at once the cause we fight for would collapse . ROBERT E. LEE God forbid that such an evil as slavery should be the principle that holds us together . I thought a cause far greater was our dream . p. 106 JEFFERSON DAVIS It is , General Lee . We are fighting for our liberty and our rights as free men . ROBERT E. LEE And what of the rights of the black man ? JUDAH P. BENJAMIN It is a fine ideal , perhaps , General Lee , but it wo n't work . VOICES No , no . It wo n't work . It 's impractical ! ROBERT E. LEE ( Half-angrily ) So it is in men 's history when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry out  --  impractical , impractical ! And thus they remain in bondage to their prejudices . Gentlemen , nothing is more practical than doing one 's duty . And it is our duty to do this . JEFFERSON DAVIS I do not think our situation demands such drastic action , General Lee . We have you and General Jackson , and such is our trust in you both that we know you will be able to hold the enemy in check . Already the world stands in admiration at the valor of your men and the genius of your leadership . Before long a new president will be elected in the North , and he wo n't be Abraham Lincoln . The peace party grows stronger and stronger there every day . The people are crying for an end to the struggle . McClellan will be chosen president and we can deal with McClellan . He is already sick of this war . p. 107 VOICES Yes , yes . STEPHEN WINSLOW We must agree with that sentiment . And we shall hold . ROBERT E. LEE And my men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice their number  --  continue to die . ( He bows his head . ) JEFFERSON DAVIS We will shorten our lines , tighten our defenses , plant more and more foodstuffs , draw in our belts , and we promise you , General Lee , the help you need . Somehow we shall raise it for you . STEPHEN WINSLOW And it will not be slaves . VOICES No , no . No slaves . ROBERT E. LEE ( Snapping up his head ) From the beginning I have believed it was honorable for the South to defend herself . Now I may be forced into an action I do not like . Among the fat farms of Pennsylvania will be food for my men and horses . Foreseeing your decision here today , I have been planning  --  ( Staring off as if thinking to himself. )  --  by swift marching with Jackson 's and Stuart 's forces we would evade General Hooker 's forces , cross the upper Potomac  --  through Hagerstown , Waynesboro and then by way of a little village by the name of  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 108 STEPHEN WINSLOW That would be a desperate venture . JEFFERSON DAVIS Too desperate . ROBERT E. LEE But to sit still under the circumstances is to be lost . JEFFERSON DAVIS No , General Lee . ( Rising . ) Gentlemen , General Joseph Hooker with a great Federal Force moving near Chancellorsville still threatens this city . The defense of Richmond remains our first concern now as ever . VOICES It does , it does . ROBERT E. LEE That is your order , Mr. President  --  to attend to Hooker ? JEFFERSON DAVIS Well then  --  yes , it is . ROBERT E. LEE ( Bowing ) I am ever obedient to civil authority as all military men should be . It is only my concern that has induced me thus to speak frankly as I have . Good day , Mr. President , gentlemen . JEFFERSON DAVIS You will dine with Mrs. Davis and me ? ROBERT E. LEE I must pay my respects to my family before getting back to Fredericksburg . Thank you . ( He turns and goes out . The meeting breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . BENJAMIN remains behind with DAVIS. ) p. 109 JEFFERSON DAVIS ( Staring after LEE ) There goes the greatest soldier in the world . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN True . But he has one weakness . His heart is too kind . If he should invade the north , then I urge you , Mr. President , to be strong where he is weak . Issue an order that he shall lay waste the North with fire and sword on this invasion , bring the war home to the Yankees as they have done in Virginia , as Sherman plans to do farther south . ( With sudden fury . ) Yea , till the sassafras bushes and fence jambs smoke with blood and the screams of the women and children fill the land . JEFFERSON DAVIS Eloquent barbarism , Mr. Benjamin . General Lee is a Christian gentleman . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN So he is . JEFFERSON DAVIS He would resign before he would obey such an order . ( Half-angrily . ) It is his very goodness , sir , his kindness that makes him an army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such blind devotion . That is why with a few he wins such tremendous victories against the many . Good day . ( Benjamin turns abruptly and goes off . DAVIS sits down at his desk , shakes his head , rubs his jaw , and begins rapidly signing documents . MRS . DAVIS comes in with a tray of food and a salt-bag poultice . She is an attractive full-figured woman in her late thirties , with a somewhat olive complexion and eloquent deep dark eyes. ) p. 110 MRS . JEFFERSON DAVIS Here 's some fresh tea and a hot salt bag for your neuralgia . ( Caressingly . ) Poor dear ! ( DAVIS lays his head against her breast , and she begins doctoring him . ) I met General Lee outside , his same kind courteous self  --  but there were tears in his eyes  --  tears .

MARY LEE ( Staring ahead of her  --  her voice dulled ) I 'll come back for you , he said . ( Fingering her scarf . ) Luther gave me this scarf the last night we danced there at Arlington . Wear it , he said , and remember me . Remember  --  yes  --  remember . ( Shuddering . ) It goes with your hair and eyes , he said . ( Looking up at her father . ) Luther 's dead .

The LIGHT dies out , the MUSIC reprises a bit of the chant and then ends . After a moment of pause , the SPOTLIGHT comes up at the Right Front and the CHAPLAIN is standing there . Again he has dispensed with his vestments. ) p. 124 THE CHAPLAIN With the burial of Stonewall Jackson , much of the hope for the Confederacy  --  despite the people 's firm determination  --  perished in the coffin with him . ( In swift recounting . ) The food and supplies President Davis promised were not sufficient , and in the summer of 1863 Lee invaded Pennsylvania . Lincoln 's new commander , General George Meade , raced to get between him and Washington , and on July 1 , the two armies collided at the little village of Gettysburg . The battle raged under the scorching sun , and men fell in gasping bloody droves on both sides  --  twenty-three thousand lost by the North and twenty thousand by the South . On the third day Lee 's drive was stopped , and he withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . And once more he took up the defence of Richmond . Lincoln now replaced Meade with Ulysses S. Grant and during the winter he massed a great force along the Rappahannock River , determined to capture Richmond . ( The LIGHT comes up on the Right incline. ) @x A little hilltop at the edge of a woods . LEE is standing there looking off through his binoculars . With him are GENERALS LONGSTREET and STUART and just behind them LEE 'S aide , CAPTAIN TAYLOR . LEE lowers his binoculars and unrolls a map he carries under his arm . ROBERT E. LEE Gentlemen , we 'll have a different man against us now in Ulysses S. Grant . I know him from West Point and Mexico days . J. E. B. STUART A drunkard and a shoe salesman , God bless him . JAMES LONGSTREET And the conqueror of Vicksburg . J. E. B. STUART Yes , he blundered into that victory . ROBERT E. LEE They say Lincoln wanted to know what kind of liquor Grant drank so he could feed it to his other generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I did McClellan . ROBERT E. LEE But it 's reported Phil Sheridan 's cavalry is to join him . J. E. B. STUART All I ask is a chance to meet this Phil Sheridan horse to horse . ROBERT E. LEE He 's a good man . p. 126 J. E. B. STUART The gooder the better . ( He laughs , pulls off his plumed hat and twirls it . ) ROBERT E. LEE Grant 's one aim in life is to take Richmond and end the war . We know that . J. E. B. STUART And he will fail like the others  --  MacDowell , McClellan , Burnside , Hooker  --  you 'll see to that , sir . ROBERT E. LEE Our job is to figure him out before he figures us . J. E. B. STUART That ought not to be hard to do . They say he 's got no imagination . ROBERT E. LEE But with will a-plenty to make up for the lack , General Stuart . JAMES LONGSTREET He 's stubborn as a mule . ROBERT E. LEE And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get the best of a stubborn mule . J. E. B. STUART The more stubborn he is the more of his men we 'll kill . JAMES LONGSTREET And that 's what he has plenty of  --  men . Lincoln sees to that . ROBERT E. LEE And we must have more men . ( Loudly . ) Somehow , we must . J. E. B. STUART If Abe Lincoln would only drop dead or somebody shoot him , we 'd finish off this war . p. 127 ROBERT E. LEE ( Coldly ) I trust there is no such wish on your part , General Stuart . J. E. B. STUART Just stating a matter of scientific warfare , sir . JAMES LONGSTREET The people in the North are all saying the same thing about General Lee  --  get rid of him and the Confederacy will collapse . J. E. B. STUART And that 's a scientific fact also . ROBERT E. LEE It is not . You two gentlemen and Joe Johnston would keep it going . ( Studying the map . ) Grant is slow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you think he will plan to strike ? JAMES LONGSTREET On our left . ROBERT E. LEE That is open country . He always admired Indian fighting  --  trees , rocks  --  hills to move behind . ( His finger on the map . ) Here 's all this wooded wilderness . J. E. B. STUART ( Dolefully ) And my cavalry would n't be much use there . JAMES LONGSTREET ( Sourly ) Ahm  --  ROBERT E. LEE He will advance here . Make preparations , General Longstreet , to move your infantry in here  --  with A. P. Hill 's  --  concealed as well as possible  --  with light artillery supporting . p. 128 JAMES LONGSTREET Good . And when old Grant comes we 'll murder him by thousands . ROBERT E. LEE And then what , General Longstreet ? JAMES LONGSTREET We 'll put him on the run like little Mac . J. E. B. STUART ( Gleefully ) And my cavalry will work on his flank like a dog on a sick cow . ROBERT E. LEE But Grant will not run . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south and east , and come at us again . We must be there to meet him  --  keeping between him and Petersburg , and protect this railroad . That for your cavalry , General Stuart . J. E. B. STUART Good , sir . I 'll be there . ( DABNEY comes in . ) DABNEY REGAN ( Saluting ) President Davis has arrived at your tent , sir . ROBERT E. LEE ( With a gesture almost of irritation ) Oh  --  ( Handing LONGSTREET the map . ) General Pickett reports more trainloads of reinforcements have reached Grant today . ( Abruptly . ) To your posts , gentlemen . Good day . LONGSTREET AND STUART Good day , sir . ( Lee returns their salute and hurries down into the shadows , DABNEY and TAYLOR following. ) p. 129 J. E. B. STUART Do you think he is right about the wilderness ? JAMES LONGSTREET ( Gruffly ) I do n't think . I 'm a soldier and always obey orders . J. E. B. STUART ( With a touch of anger at the tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meaning what you will  --  ( Bitingly . ) After Gettysburg . ( He turns and goes away at the Left .

STUART ( Singing as he goes ) He bucked so hard I could n't ride , Throwed me across on ' tother side  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; Me my mo and a diddle dum day . ( He disappears into the darkness . The SCENE FADES OUT . The MUSIC comes in with a chord or two of transition effect , and the LIGHT rises on the Left Front of the Center Stage. ) p. 130 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 General Lee 's headquarters in the field . His tent is in the background , and beyond that the edge of a forest shows . In front of the tent is a rough table . DAVIS is sitting at the table . Standing around him are several MEMBERS of his cabinet and the congress , including STEPHENS and BENJAMIN as before . LEE is standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side as if awaiting orders , and MACK is farther back by the tent tending an iron pot on a bed of fire coals . When the LIGHT comes up DAVIS is speaking emphatically . JEFFERSON DAVIS We have visited the front , and we do not feel the situation is as serious as your message said , General Lee . VOICES No we do n't . JEFFERSON DAVIS The men in the trenches are in good spirits . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN They cheered his Excellency wherever he ap peared . ROBERT E. LEE ( Shortly ) I have known many a poor fellow to cheer even as he died . ( Beating his leg with his gauntlet . ) No man has ever commanded braver soldiers than these . But they are too few  --  too few , Mr. President . ( Continuing earnestly . ) Gentlemen , when Grant moves it will be only manpower that can stop him . We have less than four months to prepare for him . We 've got to have more men and arms . p. 131 STEPHEN WINSLOW And I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Lee . VOICES Aye , aye , we are . ROBERT E. LEE By a reasonable estimate there are more than one hundred thousand home guard militia in the different states , armed and equipped and fairly well trained . And a great many of them are able-bodied men . The government could demand that these be sent here to reinforce the front before Petersburg and Richmond . JEFFERSON DAVIS And the demand would not be met . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN It would not . ROBERT E. LEE And in the various state warehouses there are supplies which the politicians are holding , so they say , for state use , when they should go to the Confederacy . In Charlotte , North Carolina there are fifteen thousand rifles and ten thousand uniforms . Governor Vance says he is holding them for Carolina 's protection Well , we are Carolina 's best protection . I demand that they be sent to the army of Northern Virginia . STEPHEN WINSLOW General Lee , we can not demand . We can only request . JEFFERSON DAVIS The Secretary of War has requisitioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met by the argument that if the home guards are broken and their equipment scattered , dispersed , there would be no means of keeping domestic peace in the separate states . Who would protect the women and children , they say ? What guarantees would they have left against the uprising of the slaves , against murderous and riotous gangs of lawless ruffians ? p. 132 VOICES Aye , that 's right . If we weaken the home guard , anarchy might break out all over the South . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN I agree with that sentiment . ROBERT E. LEE There might be some lawlessness . But I do not think there 'd be any uprising of the slaves . Our Negroes throughout the South have proved again and again their devotion and loyalty-proved it in the bondage of their chains . And now we cry out this bugabear of fear and of prejudice . Forgive me , gentlemen , but so I must view it . ( An angry murmur breaks out among the MEMBERS , and some of them turn resentfully away . DAVIS raps sharply on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ! ( The noise dies down , and DAVIS goes on strongly . ) General Lee , the hearts of us all in this meeting and of every man , woman and child of the Confederacy are filled with a grateful sense of thanks and appreciation for the noble services you have rendered your country . VOICES Yes , yes . It 's true , General Lee . STEPHEN WINSLOW But you must not ask more of us than we can do . ( LEE bows slightly but his face remains grave , even stern . DAVIS hurries on. ) p. 133 JEFFERSON DAVIS We would move heaven and earth , sir  --  in fact it often seems to me we have moved them  --  to give you what you wish  --  ( Lifting his hand with a staying motion. )  --  what you need . But this request for us to interfere with the sovereign actions of the Southern States is beyond our power to grant . The Confederacy is based on the principle of separate and equal commonwealths . And they can not be forced to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sovereign states has sworn loyalty to the Confederacy  --  one and united to death . This is a time for their loyalty , this is a time when all the parts of the Confederacy must be obedient to the needs of the whole . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN And if they will not willingly give that obedience  --  ? ROBERT E. LEE The people themselves have responded valiantly . Now let the separate state governments and their leaders do likewise . Give me men and arms and I 'll win this war . ( He looks pleadingly about him as the GROUP is silent , then continues swiftly . ) In May with good weather , the winter rains over and the roads dry , Grant will attack . I may be able to stop him . But I must do more than stop him . I must drive him back and back and scatter his army . Then the North for all of Abraham Lincoln 's effort , will quit . p. 134 JEFFERSON DAVIS And I believe you will stop him and continue to stop him with what help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in frustration . ) And stopping him will be enough . Every day the people of the North clamor more loudly for peace . The leading newspapers there are calling out for an end to the conflict . They are sick of this war . Riots have already broken out in New York , Massachusetts , and elsewhere . VOICES Hear , hear ! JEFFERSON DAVIS General Lee , we will propose to widen the conscription act  --  age limit seventeen to fifty-five  --  and ask the states to substitute them for able-bodied home guards . STEPHEN WINSLOW We can do no more . ROBERT E. LEE And , gentlemen , there has been a nefarious practice in the South whereby slave owners , men of wealth , men who claim political importance , have been freed from military service by the hiring of substitutes . There are thousands of these men . They should be conscripted at once . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN I heartily agree to that . VOICES Yes , we say so . We agree . STEPHEN WINSLOW And a bill to that effect has twice been defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then summon leadership enough to put it through . p. 135 JEFFERSON DAVIS We promise to do our best . ROBERT E. LEE But it may be that your conscription act will fail , ' your annulment of the exemption system fail again  --  then what is left ? JUDAH P. BENJAMIN ( Satirically ) I know  --  the slaves ! ROBERT E. LEE Yes , the slaves . More than a year ago I begged you to enlist them and give freedom to those who did . JEFFERSON DAVIS And as you well know we again introduced the matter in our Congress and were soundly beaten on it . ROBERT E. LEE But it should be urged again and again . ( Addressing Two MEN near him . ) In Virginia alone , gentlemen , there are half a million Negro people . A force of fifty thousand men could be raised from them and in two weeks  --  ( Striking his leg with his glove again. )  --  in two weeks ! Let Virginia take the lead in this . I beg you as congressmen from the Old Dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would . FIRST MAN ( Shaking his head ) Impossible ! SECOND MAN We could n't do it . JUDAH P. BENJAMIN They 'd fail of reelection if they did that . p. 136 ROBERT E. LEE ( Takes a step away and stares off as if trying to get control of his temper . Then he turns back and goes on more quietly ) Well , gentlemen , I thank you for your forbearance . And I need hardly remind you that we have already lost the support of England and France forever because of our failure to take a stand against slavery . Gentlemen , the night is coming down , and my boys , your soldiers , watch in their cheerless muddy trenches enduring the freezing cold with little or no cover , standing there with their muskets in their hands , valiant soldiers of the Confederacy , determined to protect this city , to protect you and me and our women and children to the death  --  defending the principles they think we stand for  --  ( His voice almost breaking. )  --  suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at suppertime and dreaming of their loved ones , praying for an end to the struggle  --  facing an overwhelming army of fresh and well-fed troops . I ask you a simple question  --  is it right to keep them there to die as so many thousands of their comrades have died when we could by doing what is just and reasonable raise up sufficient reinforcements to relieve them ? Gentlemen , it is the custom in military life when an officer is at variance with his superiors to take proper action . As head of the Army of Northern Virginia , I tender you my resignation . ( He bows . DAVIS springs to his feet . And the MEN look at one another in consternation and speechless dismay . Then a babble of VOICES breaks out. ) p. 137 JEFFERSON DAVIS ( Loudly ) General Lee , I beg you . ( He turns to the table and beats on it almost frantically . The HUBBUB gradually subsides . All the MEMBERS have gathered closely around LEE , some of them gripping his hands , his arms . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) General Lee , your president and government have final authority in this matter . They refuse to consider such a resignation . VOICES Bravo ! Hear , hear ! JEFFERSON DAVIS We command you as an honorable soldier to remain at your post . We promise we will do all that can be done to support you . ROBERT E. LEE ( After an instant of pause ) I have no choice , Mr. President . For the sake of my men I must obey  --  ( Dully and echoingly. )  --  even though you ask of us more than we can do . ( Bowing . ) Goodday , gentlemen . ( He turns away toward his tent . DAVIS slaps the table with a loud pop of his open hand . ) JEFFERSON DAVIS We stand adjourned ! ( The SCENE BLACKS OUT . The MUSIC comes in with a transition effect and dies . There is a moment of silence , and then a number of WOMEN 'S CHEERY VOICES are heard singing in the darkness. ) p. 138 VOICES ( To the tune of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a Southern girl , &nbsp; &nbsp; And glory in the name  --  ( The LIGHT comes up at the Right Front of the Center Stage. ) p. 139 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 A room in the Lee house in Richmond . It is a somewhat bleak place compared to Arlington , with an empty fireplace at the Rear , a plain mantelpiece above , and a curtained window at the Left . To the Right and Left Front are doors leading into a hall . A table is in the Center . Some eight or ten women are working away  --  MRS . LEE , the LEE GIRLS , MRS . GEORGE PICKETT , MRS.JAMES CHESNUT , and in the Rear near the fireplace AUNT MIMEY and NANCY . Some are tearing old petticoats and sheets into strips with ripping sounds and rolling them into bandages , others sewing and mending old Confederate uniforms , shirts and caps . MRS . LEE and MILDRED are at the table sorting out socks and underwear and putting the folded articles into a hamper nearby . MILDRED is standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather somberly and poorly dressed . The scene is one of intense and concentrated work , and the pantomime of energetic activity is carried on in rhythm to the swift tempo of the song .

Hurrah ! &nbsp; &nbsp; For the sunny South so dear , Three cheers for the homespun dress &nbsp; &nbsp; The Southern ladies wear .

MRS . CHESTNUT ( Sprightly and vivacious , about thirty-five ) I like homespun clothes . I do n't miss my finery one bit  --  not me . MRS . GEORGE PICKETT ( A beautiful and artless young woman of twenty ) Me neither . I 'd give every stitch I wear for the Confederacy . MRS . CHESTNUT Why , Mrs. Pickett  --  then , as you might say , you 'd be without a shift . ( The WOMEN laugh . ) MRS . GEORGE PICKETT My husband likes me that way anyway  --  sometimes . VOICES ( As if scandalized ) Ooh-la ! MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Looking at the trousers she is folding ) The soldiers that wore these britches must have done more sitting than fighting . They 're all worn out behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee must have had ' em by mistake . Our Southern boys do n't sit , Mrs. Lee . They fight . MRS .

Wonder what po ' boy died in it . ( She holds up the torn coat . MRS . DAVIS enters at the Rear . MRS . LEE sees her . ) MRS . ROBERT E. LEE Mrs. Davis ! ( SEVERAL of the WOMEN stand up and give little curtsies . MRS . DAVIS puts out her hand . ) MRS . JEFFERSON DAVIS Please do n't get up . ( She comes on into the room . She is plainly dressed like the other women and carries a beautiful gown on her arm . She hands it to MILDRED . ) Here , Mildred , I have another dress I can spare . AUNT MIMEY ( Crying out ) Lawd-a-mercy , Mis ' Davis , you ai n't gwine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE No , you ca n't , Mrs. Davis . MRS . JEFFERSON DAVIS You women have cut up yours .

MILDRED LEE You wore it at the inaugural ball . I saw you . p. 142 MRS . GEORGE PICKETT ( Sighing ) What a night of joy that was ! And now  --  MRS . CHESTNUT And how General Beauregard and General Johnston whirled the ladies round ! MRS . JEFFERSON DAVIS Take it , I tell you , cut it up . Then I will  --  ( She turns , picks up scissors lying by , and snips off a great piece of its shining fold . ) There , go ahead and finish it . MARY LEE ( Coldly ) I 'll cut it up for you  --  like my scarf . ( She takes the dress from MRS .

LEE What 's happened , Mrs. Chesnut ? MRS . CHESTNUT I 've broke my needle . And I do n't know where to find another one in all Richmond . p. 143 MRS . JEFFERSON DAVIS I have an extra one at home you can borrow . I 'll send John over with it . ( She goes out and the WOMEN continue their swift working . ) MRS . CHESTNUT Bless her .

But look what we 've got ! ( She shows the bucket around . ) A whole peck of black walnuts  --  up by the cemetery . MILDRED LEE And we 'll make a walnut cake .

LEE ( Reaching out and taking his hand ) And if all the men were as admiring as you we would be spoiled rotten . ROBERT E. LEE ( Smiling at her ) And how are you feeling , my lady ? MRS . ROBERT E. LEE Strange  --  in all this trouble I do n't have time to think of my old rheumatism any more . See how I can wiggle my fingers now ? ( With girlish archness . ) What do you think of that , sir ? ROBERT E. LEE That at least is one good thing to come out of this war  --  your forgetting some of your pain . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Suddenly ) Tchk , of course you 're hungry . I 've got some bread and jam the girls put here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads jam on it and hands it to him . He takes it and munches away . ) ROBERT E. LEE Uhm  --  good . MRS . ROBERT E.

( Searching his face . ) Did you come by the President 's house ? p. 147 ROBERT E. LEE Yes . ( She pulls him down in a seat beside her . ) MRS . ROBERT E. LEE The papers are very abusive of him . ROBERT E. LEE ( Stretching out his feet ) In many ways he is a very great man  --  tenacious , full of conviction , of immense willpower . I do not always agree with him , but I respect him . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE How much longer will it go on , Robert ? What do Mr. Davis and the cabinet think ? ROBERT E. LEE They keep promising all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . And Grant keeps edging around , edging around , probing , probing , never relenting . All the while he grows stronger . We grow weaker . The showdown is yet to come . ( He rises suddenly and turns about the room . ) MRS . ROBERT E. LEE Please rest , Robert  --  rest here a little while . ROBERT E. LEE It 's so peaceful I fear I 'd not have energy to get up and go again . ( He returns and stands by her , his hand resting on her shoulder . ) MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Stroking his hand ) Oh , my dear , I know something of the weight you are carrying  --  the pain in your heart , the suffering you endure . p. 148 ROBERT E. LEE ( A little grimly ) Well , something has turned my beard a frosty white  --  maybe it 's age . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE I 'd give my life to ease your sorrows away . I would . ROBERT E.

But I feel guilty for every wounded one , for every one that dies  --  guilty in my soul . ( Shaking his head . ) Strange . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE Grief , not guilt , Robert . No , no . ROBERT E. LEE But the weight  --  ah , the weight here  --  like guilt it is . ( Sweeping his hand across his face as if to clear away troubled thoughts . ) Now my love , no more of this complaining . Look , the sunset across the river ! Like a great shower of gold in the sky . ( He turns her chair toward the window . ) MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Gazing out ) Beautiful and peaceful ! That 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see the sunset . At Arlington I could never see it for the trees . ( Sighing . ) Arlington ! Arlington ! ( She leans her head against him. ) p. 149 ROBERT E. LEE In my tent at night I have a constant dream  --  I see a world full of sunlight like that out there . I hear the mocking-birds singing in the oaks around Arlington . Millions of birds it seems . Peace has come , and you and I and the children are back there . The dogwood on the hills is white like snow and the daffodils , acres of them , are yellow as gold . And I see you , my love , moving among them and tending them . And you look up at me , your face all smiles , and your cheeks pink . And I reach my arms for you . Then I wake up and I hear the sentries pacing their beat there and in the swamps the crying of the screech owl . But my heart is lifted in me thinking of you . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort me  --  ( Gesturing. )  --  out there . I have much to be thankful for . And most of all I am thankful for your love .

Without it I would die , Robert , die . My body is old , old now . But my love for you is young . ROBERT E. LEE In one thing you are wrong . You are not old . You are still young to me , my girl . ( He lifts one of her hands . ) And these dear hands , the work they have done ! Through the years  --  never quiet , always working , working  --  and now still knitting and sewing away ! p. 150 MRS . ROBERT E. LEE There 's little enough I can do when you do so much .

LEE ( Jocularly ) You 'll spoil me so  --  I wo n't be fit for fighting . There , see the evening star hanging by the edge of that little cloud . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Staring off ) Beautiful ! ROBERT E. LEE Like a great flower hanging there  --  one of your daffodils it reminds me of . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE The daffodils at Arlington . ( Holding his hand against her cheek . ) Shining there bright and steady . ROBERT E. LEE Yes , steady  --  that 's the word . MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Shaking her head ) Robert , I sit here and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when it will all be over . There will be no rest for you then either , I know it . The Confederacy will still require your leadership . And I promise you I will help . I 'm not afraid . I 'll continue to help you with what poor strength I can command . p. 151 ROBERT E. LEE God bless you . And there will be hard work for all of us  --  our children too  --  work that peace may abide in both our countries . There will be bitterness on both sides  --  revenge and hate . It is always so after a war . We must try to cure them . Perhaps I shall become a school-teacher like Mr. Leary . I think about him a lot . Virginia will need a great school . Maybe I could help build one . Yes , my dear , we shall have no time to wither and rot on the bough as old people often do . We 'll be too busy . And poverty we do not mind . We know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE ( Taking his hand ) No , not afraid .

JESSICA BARRETT We met Lieutenant Regan and the President on the street . Mr. Davis questioned Father , then had him arrested . And he tells Dabney to bring him along to you here . You 've got to let him go , General Lee . ROBERT E. LEE There now , do n't worry . JESSICA BARRETT We came to see my brother Pat  --  he 's wounded  --  we had a safe conduct pass from Alexandria .

DABNEY REGAN ( Calling out to JESSICA ) I could n't help it , Miss Jessica . Mr. Davis gave me an order and I had to obey it . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT I came to see my poor boy  --  a prisoner in the hospital  --  and then drove by the Tredegar Iron Works  --  to have a look . ROBERT E. LEE You should know that 's forbidden .

We 've got to go fix for Mrs. Davis ' dance . ( To JESSICA . ) We have no pretty dresses  --  like yours . ( She and AGNES turn and go quickly out . JESSICA sits bowed over in her chair . DABNEY looks sorrowfully across at her . AUNT MIMEY draws her stick and steps quickly toward BARRETT . ) AUNT MIMEY ( Squealing ) Git out of heah , you nasty stinking Yankee trash ! Git out ! ( BARRETT turns angrily on her , and with a scream she flees to LEE for protection . ) ROBERT E. LEE Behave yourself , Mimey  --  go help the girls .

LEE Oh  --  JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT He was young and strong  --  and now a cripple for life . And all over this land are thousands like him , and other countless thousands lying in Virginia earth , their mouths stopped with clay . And you , Robert , are to blame for it . p. 154 MRS . ROBERT E. LEE If you 've come here to abuse my husband , Judge Barrett , you may leave . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( With a harsh laugh ) You forget I am a prisoner in his charge . ROBERT E. LEE I have no wish to keep you . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT For this courtesy much thanks . ( He starts away , then stops . ) And now in kindness and for old time 's sake I 'll repay you with some information as well as friendly counsel . MRS . ROBERT E.

JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Hurrying on ) I have recently traveled in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the well-being and strength that increase every day . Everywhere soldiers and more soldiers are riding away to join Grant 's army and fight against you , Robert . Every hour the North grows more powerful . Every hour the South grows weaker . Today the North has a million soldiers under arms . A year hence if need be two million . And food  --  abundant food . ROBERT E. LEE ( Irritatedly ) What is the purpose of your speech , William ? JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT To show you the facts and to urge you in all reason to give over this insane struggle . You can never win this war . ( With a snap in his voice . ) Just that ! p. 155 ROBERT E. LEE You do not convince me with your boasting . And when I beat the britches off Grant as I expect to do  --  JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT It 'll be your britches instead of Grant 's . ROBERT E. LEE We shall see . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT And I will see  --  Lincoln , Grant , and myself . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets the soldiers for the job , Grant leads them , and I arm them from my factories and arsenals . And such arms ! I have furnished Grant 's men with thousands of repeating rifles  --  these against your poor muskets and squirrel guns ! MRS . ROBERT E. LEE And our men seem to have done well with what they have . ( Stingingly . ) You should have furnished your generals with brains . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Ignoring her and going on ) At the beginning I told you how it would be  --  Virginia would break in two . She has , and we have set up the separate state of West Virginia . I told you our native state would be red with blood and ruined . So it has happened . I told you  --  ROBERT E. LEE ( Sharply ) I told you , I told you  --  and now you 're telling me again . p. 156 JESSICA BARRETT Please , Father . ( BARRETT puts out a shushing hand toward her . ) JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT I am . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open your eyes , lay aside your Southern blindness and pride and face the truth and do the right and Christian thing  --  put an end to this killing . ROBERT E. LEE I have no power to end the war except by victory on the battlefield . And that I expect to have . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Your great influence over the people , their love for you , give you that power . If you would say  --  end the struggle , they would follow you . ROBERT E. LEE And what could be more dishonorable than such an action , William ! I will carry on to the last ounce of my strength  --  fight on till in here in my heart I know I have done all that can be done . My men , they will not quit and I will not quit . Let it be said of us by future generations if anything is said  --  they gave all they had , they would not weaken , they stood and failed not to the last ! JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Throws up his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue on your way . Still I am your friend . ( Earnestly . ) This war has sprung forth tremendous talents among the people in the North . And the new South will share in them  --  the South that 's so long been asleep . And as one reunited people driving on together we shall in time make this the mightiest nation on earth . p. 157 ROBERT E. LEE The nation you would build is not mine , William . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( His voice booming as he moves about ) The pouring tide of life and more life ! Ploughing up the prairies , cutting the forests , making new cities , factories , railroads , mines , bridges and roads  --  power , strength , life ! America ! ( Turning abruptly on LEE . ) I have created a big combine of financial power . My business has grown greater year after year  --  my railroads , mines and factories .

Listen to me  --  I want you in with me as a partner  --  in this great adventure of creation . I do , Robert . ( As LEE stares at him in silence . ) You can name any salary you wish . ( He plants himself in front of LEE . ) ROBERT E. LEE ( Quietly ) As an engineer I too have known the joy of making designs and plans on a dead piece of white paper and seeing them come to shape and existence in wood and steel and stone . It is life to the heart of a man . And yet I have always had to ask myself as I worked  --  what does it stand for , what is the idea , the purpose behind it , how does it benefit my fellowman ? No , William , the America you envision would be a cruel , heartless thing without conscience or compassion . p. 158 JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Making people prosperous and happy is benefiting your fellowman , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because this nation went grasping in its greed for the very things you speak of , seeking gain and power , building and splurging with no thought of the human consequences  --  exploiting , exploiting  --  one section the stronger at the expense of another section the weaker  --  forgetting the truth that once we knew  --  because of these things we fell like thieves to quarrelling over the spoils , and this dreadful war resulted . We lost the light by which to guide our way . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Quickly and with a touch of good humor ) All right now that we 've learned our lesson in the war , we shall  --  ROBERT E. LEE ( Loudly ) But you have not learned it , the North has not learned it . ( His voice rising . ) This America of ours once held a beacon light for the oppressed people everywhere  --  life , liberty , equality and justice for all . These were once the principles that thrilled the world . On them our nation was begun . Our leaders betrayed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am fighting to help establish , they shall be cherished and preserved , so help me God !

Judge Barrett , you are free to go ! p. 159 JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Well , preacher , I 'll argue with your eloquence no more . Go your way to death and defeat then , Robert , go your way . Come , Jessica . ( Jessica rises and kisses MRS . LEE in farewell . She clings to MRS . LEE 'S hand and looks at her father . ) JESSICA BARRETT Father , could I please  --  stay a few days  --  and visit  --  MRS . ROBERT E. LEE Yes , Judge Barrett , let her . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Loudly ) No , you may not . ( JESSICA turns , curtsies to LEE , and follows obediently after her father . DABNEY hurries forward , but BARRETT stops him with his raised cane . ) And we do n't need you , young man . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and looks out .

DABNEY runs suddenly across the room and out at the left . LEE turns to MRS . LEE . ) We have three strong adversaries  --  Lincoln , Grant , and Judge Barrett  --  and of all , the Judge is to be feared most  --  but not because of his rifles . Goodbye , my love . p. 160 MRS . ROBERT E. LEE ( Sitting up straight ) Goodbye , and I will be at the window there when you come riding Traveler home at the head of your victorious army .

I have some important  --  er  --  dispatches to write . ( He follows LEE off into the shadows up the incline at the Left , looking in the direction JESSICA has gone .

He was stopped with great loss . He moved to Lee 's right , and on May 10 struck again at Spotsylvania Courthouse and was again defeated . On May 11 Stuart met Sheridan 's cavalry in the battle of Yellow Tavern , and the gallant young Southerner was mortally wounded . Grant pulled around , and Lee was there to meet him , and once more at Cold Harbor the federal troops were slaughtered . But Grant would n't quit , and he edged away south and east toward Petersburg , Lee keeping in front of him . On June 15 to 18 he attacked again , and eight thousand of his men fell . During these battles he had lost some seventy thousand of his best soldiers . Sorrow , dismay and anger now swept the North and the people began to cry out for an end to the war . And the voice of Jefferson Davis sent forth his call  --  ( He turns and looks toward the Rear . The MUSIC comes in with a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds in a discord . The LIGHT dims on the CHAPLAIN and comes up at the Rear , revealing the figure of JEFFERSON DAVIS as if behind a scrim , speaking loudly across the land . ) VOICE OF DAVIS You can not conquer us . We have proved it again and again . General Lee will never be beaten . The continuance of this war means but the murder of thousands of your brothers , sons , husbands . The God of Justice will not allow your tyrannous leaders to triumph over us . And the guilt for the spilling of further blood be on their heads . We ask nothing more than our freedom . And that we are determined to have . We offer you peace . Stop this war ! ( The FIGURE fades out , and the MUSIC holds , then changes into a low discord of " John Brown 's Body .

( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rear the gaunt figure of LINCOLN is seen , speaking loudly across the land . ) VOICE OF LINCOLN There will be no compromise . There will be no yielding . The rebellion will be put down . Yea , we pray that this scourge of war may speedily pass away . But if it must continue until every drop of blood drawn by the slaver 's lash for two hundred and fifty years shall be paid for by another drawn from our people by the sword , so let it be . The Union must be preserved . This war shall go on till victory is won .

The MUSIC comes in with a short reprise of the hymn and the LIGHT comes up again on the CHAPLAIN at the Right Front. ) p. 179 THE CHAPLAIN Through the winter of 1864-65 Grant built up his army . Lee got what scattering help he could from the Confederate government . The Southern states now in their separate and sovereign rights began to look each to its own defense .

As one man fell there were two to take his place . Lee frantically appealed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the relentless hammering , his lines grew thinner .

And there is now no North or South but one nation  --  America . The shedding of the blood of our people has purged away our sins and united us forever . The Confederacy is now our Lost Cause , but the ideals we served are not lost . ( Suddenly JUDGE BARRETT 'S angry voice is heard from the incline at the Right. ) p. 203 BARRETT 'S VOICE Go back , I tell you , go back ! ( The PEOPLE freeze motionless in the scene , and the LIGHT dims down on them somewhat and brightens over at the Right . JUDGE BARRETT is seen standing there in front of his son PAT , barring his way forward . PAT has suffered from hard wounds in the war and one coat sleeve is empty . He is helping himself along with a cane . ) PAT BARRETT No , Father . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT I 'll not let you . PAT BARRETT ( Determinedly ) Yes , Father ! I 'm going to General Lee 's school . JUDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going back home with me . I need you . PAT BARRETT No , Father . ( AGNES comes running up the incline from the shadows . ) AGNES LEE Pat ! PAT BARRETT ( Joyfully ) Agnes ! ( He pushes on by his FATHER and joins her . Hand in hand they go down the incline toward the motionless PEOPLE . JESSICA and DABNEY come along the incline from the shadows at the Right . ) JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Reaching out to stop them ) Jessica ! ( She tries to push by him . He steps in front of her , and DABNEY takes her firmly by the hand. ) p. 204 DABNEY REGAN ' We 're going to help General Lee in his school , Jessica and I. JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT No ! DABNEY REGAN Come on , Jessica . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT ( Shouting ) I forbid you , Jessica ! JESSICA BARRETT ( Shaking her head ) I 'm going , Father . ( She starts on , then stops . She runs over and takes him by the arm . ) Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! You could help him . JUDGE WILLIAM BARRETT Are you crazy ! ( He jerks loose from her . She and DABNEY go on down into the shadows . BARRETT rages . ) My children  --  they desert me  --  they leave me for that  --  that  --  ( Shaking his stick frustratedly in the air. )  --  that mouthing moralist ! ( He turns and stares down toward LEE and the PEOPLE . He hesitates , takes a step in that direction and stops . The LIGHT fades from him and rises on the Center Stage again . The scene is energized into action once more . ) ROBERT E. LEE Let us put aside all hate and bitterness from our hearts . ( Clasping the Bible before him . ) From this Good Book , from other good books and from the wisdom of our fathers we shall learn the truth as it is written . And as we learn  --  ( Almost sternly. )  --  and as we work , we shall the more certainly rebuild our country  --  righteous and strong . In the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's wounds , care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan  --  and do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations . p. 205 VOICES Yes . Yes . We will . ( While LEE is speaking JUDGE BARRETT comes down into the edge of the light and stands looking irritatedly on . ) ROBERT E. LEE ( Loudly , commandingly ) And now with lifted hearts let us turn to our duty ! ( The MUSIC strikes up again in " The Conquered Banner " song . And now , as if its resignation and acceptance are made , it is buoyant and strong . LEE reaches out and takes little BOB LEE 'S hand and leads the way diagonally up the steps of the waiting building at the Rear . The PEOPLE begin following him  --  PAT with AGNES , BUCK happy with COUSIN BETTY , the LEE FAMILY , and after them DABNEY and JESSICA . The MUSIC continues to build . Suddenly JESSICA runs over and takes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the procession moving after LEE . And again he jerks away from her . She smiles pleadingly at him an instant , and then she and DABNEY go on up the steps . NANCY and MACK remain behind , standing side by side . The MUSIC increases its strength . BARRETT starts away at the Right Front . He stops and stands staring at the ground , then gazes about him . The LIGHT begins to dim down . At the last moment he turns and with thoughtful querying steps starts toward the columned building , his cane gripped in front of him . Suddenly he breaks into something of a little malicious laugh and gestures sternly for NANCY and MACK to follow him . The SCENE FADES OUT . The MUSIC comes in with its dynamic and affirmative reprise and ends . The LIGHTS come on in the amphitheatre )                                        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
