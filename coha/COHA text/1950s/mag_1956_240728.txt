Six other primaries last week all but completed the lineup for the 1956 general election . Important results : <P> In Washington , where primary election voters can jump party lines at will on a single ballot , Democratic candidates rolled up substantially bigger vote totals than Republicans in most statewide races , were led by affable , two-term Senator Warren G. Magnuson , 51 , who , although unopposed for renomination , gathered 426,000 . This was a resounding 150,000 more than his November opponent , Republican Governor Arthur B. Langlie ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) , managed to poll in his primary race . Thoroughly drubbed in the Republican gubernatorial primary : Donald W. Eastvold , Washington 's ambitious young ( 36 ) attorney general , who first gained political fame as the Ike-supporting " young man with a book " at the 1952 G.O.P. National Convention , later had a personal falling out with Governor Langlie . Eastvold lost by a two-to-one margin to Langlie-backed Lieutenant Governor Emmett T. Anderson . Anderson 's November opponent : State Senator Albert D. Rosellini of Seattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic nomination . <P> In Colorado , Harry Truman 's Agriculture Secretary Charles F. Brannan , author of the direct-subsidy , surplus-building Brannan Plan , discovered that his popularity with parity-conscious wheat growers and other farmers was not enough to offset ex-Representative John A. Carroll 's edge in Carroll 's home city of Denver , lost the Democratic senatorial nomination to Carroll 60,494 to 62,391 . Carroll , defeated in the 1954 Senate race , faces ex-Governor Dan Thornton , 45 , ardent Ikeman , in November . <P> In Georgia , Herman Talmadge , 43 , proved himself not only a far more polished platform performer but a better vote-getter than his late father , gallus-snapping Old Gene . Ex-Governor Talmadge , running for the U.S. Senate seat of the retiring Walter George , piled up a four-to-one margin over onetime Acting Governor Melvin Thompson , in the process carried every one of the state 's 159 counties-a feat his daddy could never match . Winning an election at a relatively early age in a state accustomed to sticking with its Senators , this new breed of white-supremacy demagogue could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come .
