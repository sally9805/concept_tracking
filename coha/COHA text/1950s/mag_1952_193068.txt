When Albert Marquet and Henri Matisse were art students in Paris , they used to load their canvases into the same pushcart , hopefully trundle them off to the Autumn Salon . On one return trip , no canvases sold , Marquet lamented , " If only a bus would crash into our pushcart , we could at least collect the damages . " Matisse soon trundled his own brilliant , revolutionary canvases into the front ranks of modern French art . Marquet settled down to painting workmanlike studies of boat-filled harbors and rivers , lagged far behind . He died in 1947 , at 72 , little known outside his native France . <P> Last week a Paris exhibit of unknown Marquet drawings showed that he was not always the serious , hard-working rearguard painter most people thought him . As relaxation from his more ambitious oils , Marquet had strolled the streets of Paris , doing maliciously observant sketches of the people he saw . In a few deft strokes , a blob of black ink or a casual crosshatching , he caught the posture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , an old fiacre driver waiting for a fare , a bemused , potbellied pedestrian . <P> Matisse compared old friend Marquet 's sketches to those of Master Japanese Draftsman Hokusai . Said Paris-Presse Critic Ren Barotte : " It is difficult to express more life in fewer lines . . . impossible to use black and white better . " <P> Marquet had not taken his little masterpieces that seriously . During his lifetime , he sketched thousands of them for his own entertainment , stacked them away in his studio without ever thinking of exhibiting or selling them .
