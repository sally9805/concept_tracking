The World of Mr. Sweeney ( Tues. - Fri. 7:30 p.m. , NBCTV ) stars Oldtime Cinemactor Charlie Ruggles as a small-town storekeeper who likes to chuckle out warm , homemade philosophical comments while his dowdy customers cluck around palpating tomatoes and cantaloupes . Happily , the 15-minute show steers clear of the heap-o ' - livin ' or Just Plain Bilge routine and stays easygoing and amusing . Item : Sweeney 's young grandson , played by Glenn Walken , asks for a candy bar , then borrows a dime from Sweeney and rings it up on the cash register ; this , says Sweeney , " keeps him honest . " <P> Out on the Farm ( Sun. , 5 p.m. , NBCTV ) is an hour-long pseudo documentary that aims at illustrating to the city viewer the grandeurs of bucolic life . The first program was just sow-sow . It originated mostly " live " from the Wilbert Landmeier farm near Cloverdale , Ill. , with Country Singer Eddy Arnold on hand to greet viewers and help show the folks around the place . The cameras ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking ; to the front yard , for a talk with Mother Landmeier and her healthy youngsters ; to the barnyard , where Weatherman Clint Youle spoke of the crops and elements ( " In Georgia and Virginia , the pecans are doing pretty well " ) ; and too frequently to tireless Eddy Arnold , who will twang out a li'l song at the drop of a cornball . The chief trouble with the show , in fact , is that it is too city-slick ; it needs more hay , less hey-hey.
