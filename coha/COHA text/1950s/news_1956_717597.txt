Letters to The Times Forest Fires According to a bulletin of the United States Forest Service , an average of 200,000 forest fires burn and char an estimated 30 million acres of woodland annually . Needless to say , such forest floors are greatly impaired in their waterholding capacity and contribute a great deal toward our floods . Since forests are of such inestimable value in flood control , why do we keep decimating them ? Towns , cities , airports , highways , industrial development , etc. , encroach on forest and farmland in appalling strides . These are all paved , impervious areas which put an end to the infiltration of rainwater into the ground . Today an estimated 105 million acres are manmade " drainboards " where runoff is always at an optimum . Worst of all , these " drainboard " areas are increasing at a fast pace . An estimated one billion tons of topsoil are washed away into the rivers and oceans annually . Topsoil , being rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain a great deal of water if protected from erosion . The loss of so much topsoil renders our land progressively less able to absorb the rains , hence more and more runoff water is flooding our creeks , rivers and valleys . It is quite obvious that humus-rich , protected soil is an ultimate factor in flood control . Inadequate Protection Contour plowing Is not enough to stop runoff and soil erosion . Our soil protection methods are still inadequate . The humus is vanishing from our soils at a fast pace . Most of our organic discards are still dumped into rivers and oceans or burned in incinerators or backyards . Our organic waste outlets have not been . put to proper use in our soil , conservation program . An estimated 400 million tons of humus could be retrieved from our organic discards annually if collection and processing of same were properly and universally organized . Humus can hold more water , pound for pound , than any other type of soil . It follows that the conversion of organic discards into humus is a missing link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control measures as outlined above can take root and become effective , transient measures must be resorted to . Runoff water can in most cases be diverted into the subsoil whereever it accumulates , by means of intake pits or wells which are placed in creeks , riverbeds and bottomland . Such pits should be driven to pervious strata such as sand , gravel , peat , fissured rock , etc. , into which the floodwaters would be siphoned . FRANK D. STEINER . Orinda , Calif. , Jan. 3 , 1955 , For Peace in the Middle East To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Y ORK " 1:1Mbb Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge reported to the United Nations Security Council that the recent " retaliatory " massacre of forty-nine Syrians east of Galilee , following a previous border incident which merely caused " a bullet hole " in an Israeli patrol boat , " should now be added to the list of military actions which Israel initiated at Gaza , at Qibya and El Hamma . " This is not to mention the scores of other similar unprovoked attacks where hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slain by the Israeli forces . No wonder even the National Jewish Post fittingly equates such " acts of horror " with the " detestable'Nazi wiping out of entire villages * * . ? Ironically enough , this last raid came on the crest of Israel 's bond drive and feverish campaign to obtain arms from the United States to defend itself against what it calls Arab aggression . The core of the matter was adequately expressed by Walter Zender , a Jewish scholar and humanitarian , who emphasized in his book entitled " Is This the Way ? " that " The cardinal problem of the Palestiniasa issue can be summed up in this single sentence that we Jews had to build our national home in a exult ? try in which another people is living . * * * Our failure to recognize the real situation has made a settlement with the Arabs nearly impossible . * * * It is obvious that ultimately peace with our neighbors is required . At present we are trying to achieve this peace by force and to build up in feverish haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But under no conditions can force be enough * * * . " ABDELMONEM SHAKER . New York , Jan. 5 , 1956 . Jury Trial Delays Proposal to Relieve Calendars by Payment of Interest Opposed TOTHE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : . I am a lawyer and not a logician , but when Morris Ernst , on Dec. 30 , in what appears to me to be an illogical attack on proposals to limit the right to trial by jury in civil cases , solicits a logical answer to WS ' arguments I am impelled to challenge his " simple state of facts " reasoning . It appears to be his thesis that jury trials can be preserved and congested court calendars relieved by the simple expedient of adding interest to the plaintiff 's judgment , computed from the date of injury or filing of a claim to the date the judgment is satisfied . This proposal , which " Judge Peck and the leaders of the bar have rejected , " would result in " normal pressure for settlements " on insurance companies , and consequently " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . " If Mr. Ernst 's suggestion should be adopted what would he the thinking of a plaintiff and his counsel in personal injury cases ? Such plaintiff would be assured of a 6 per cent return on his ultimate recovery for as long as the jury trial delay continued . Surely he would have every incentive to insist on a jury trial rather than the immediate trial before a judge available by waiving such right . Effect on Settlements A plaintiff with a reasonably good case and not in present need would not have any real reason to forgo the advantages of delay . The insure ance company , on the other hand , during negotiations for settlement would have to raise its offer to compensate for the interested payment which the plaintiff could assure himself by resting on his right to demand a jury trial . The inevitable result would be unjustifiably high settlements and even higher automobile liability insurance rates than New Yorkers now pay or a. marked increase in personal injury jury trials and the deplorable situation which Judge Peck has Muminated  --  just the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished and responsible leaders of the bar un  --  T consciously reject his " simple and logical device " because they represent leading insurance companies and have covetous eyes for more judgeships merits no reply . If reputable lawyers ever consider , even unconsciously , personal factors , it is much more logical to find them in the minds of those wliofrequently represent plaintiffs in personal injury cases , whose compensation so often is computed at one-third to one-half of the plaintiff 's recovery . Jury trial delays do indeed demand an investigation by the Governor and the Legislature , but Mr. ' Ernst 's solution is not the answer . Once the answer is found , and I , . know of no other than the one Judge Peck so ably espouses , we can tackle the inconsistent way in which interest is awarded in civil cases . E. LAURENCE GULYASSY . New York , Dec. 30 , 1955 . Pattern in Egg Market To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In the discussion on . the Hill in , Washington over farm-price policy , it is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without any controls of any kind , without any parity schedule , without any politics , the farmers who produce eggs , the stores which sell them and the consumers who eat them have worked out through the operation of free market forces an agricultural pattern which provides a firm supply at fair prices of in. creasing quality for increased con. sumption . I mention this fact at this time because it seems to me worth not . ; ing what one industry in our ag  --  icultural economy has achieved . The ? pattern might be one worth further study . WALDO HALDEMAN . Rosemont , Pa. , Jan. 6. 1956 . To Control Floods Dams Held Insufficient , Long-Range Measures Believed Necessary TOTHE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have been an ardent reader of your newspaper for years . As civil engineer I am qualified to comment on the recent heavy and destructive floods . Dams are not enough . The floods in northern California are the worst on record for that region . To ' say they are an act of God is sheer blasphemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Western Ranges , " published in 1936 , points out that California enjoyed considerably more ' rain in previous decades , and the recordings , begun in 1850 , give evidence of a definite downward trend of rainfall . How is it then that with less rain we ' now have greater floods , despite the hundreds of dams that have been built since that time to control the floodwaters ? Recent literature estimates that ten million acres of timberland are harvested annually throughout the United States . On the other hand , replanting is moving at snail 's pace . All citizens should know that forest floors , on the whole , retain large quantities of water and are the best bulwarks against floods and soil erosion . In the spring forests are far better able to absorb the melting masses of snow than denuded land . In some cases forest floors can hold twice their own weight in water . Forests and their subsoils are natural water reservoirs .                   @ @
