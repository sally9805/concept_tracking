In Paris last week , L'Humanit , No. 2 Communist newspaper in the West ( see above ) , screamed in pained indignation about a " scandalous verdict . " L'Humanit had good reason to be pained , since the verdict pointed an.accusing finger at the source of its financial backing . <P> Last fall Paris ' big ( est. circ. 400,000 ) , right-wing L'Aurore charged that L'Humanit , whose circulation has dropped from 600,000 to 172,000 in the last seven years , " would long ago be dead if it had not received subsidies from abroad . " L'Humanit replied with a libel suit against L'Aurore , demanded 1,000,000 francs damages . In court , witness after witness backed up L'Aurore 's charges of support from Russia . Among them : <P> Onetime Spanish Communist Leader Julian Gorkin testified that both French and Spanish Communist campaigns were financed by Moscow . Sixty percent of the gold of the Spanish Republican government , he said , was whisked away to Moscow during the civil war , and more than $4,000,000 was later sent back to Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist daily , Ce Soir . <P> Camille Bornerie , ex-Communist newsman , recalled that in 1937 the Communists received $1,000,000 from Russia for propaganda purposes , concluded : " I do n't know why L'Humanit started this trial . When you are a Bolshevik soldier , there is nothing dishonorable about receiving money from the Soviet Union . " <P> After hearing the evidence , the court threw out the libel suit , ruled that the charges against L'Humanit " are likely to be true . " Added L'Aurore last week : " Such a judgment should open the eyes of those Frenchmen . . . who think that . . . the Communists have the interests of France at heart just like anyone else .
