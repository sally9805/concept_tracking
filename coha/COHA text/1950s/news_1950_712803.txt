txt Letters to The Times ALEXANDER S. LIPSETTEDWIN J. AKUTOWICZ , JULIAN H. BLAU , RILEY M. BATES.MICHAEL ... Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Press and radio have been in a dither these past weeks over the volume of industrial business and profits in 1949 . Comment has ranged from sneers on the left to such compliments as fabulous and unheard of . Imagine 565 corporations in twenty-six major fields reporting a net income of $5,000,000,000 , an awed commentator mused ; such figures have heretofore been reserved for Washington . Far be it from me to object to those oh 's and ah 's or to belittle the new records hung up by industry during the past year . Indeed , the feat is such as to warm the heart of every American and make him proud of the country 's capacity to outproduce anyone . But the situation calls for more than boastfulness . It calls for an analysis of this phenomenal growth and appraisal of the factors behind it . General Motors , we are informed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $656,000,000 profit for its 434,000 stockholders , paid $1,440,000 , - 000 in wages to its 401,000 employes and , last but not least , shelled out $880,000,000 for federal , state and local taxation , including sales and excess levies . Du Pont , General Electric and others have done equally well . The significance of these achievements not only to the people concerned but to the entire national economy is obvious . Inflationary Pressure But having said that , let 's calmly survey the situation . The principal factor behind these striking increases , as G. M. calls them , was inflationary pressure ; never in American history has there been so much money in the hands of the people . But the value of our money also differs from that of the past ; the dollar , ' as far as purchasing power goes , has been cut in half ; living costs , as any housewife knows , are at least 70 per cent above those of 1939 . These conditions are reflected in correspondingly high wages , production and replacement expenditures , and many other cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of making a lot of money is agreeable to everybody , but we must not permit ourselves to be fooled by a lot of big yet essentially meaningless figures . With materials , production costs , wages , etc. , two to three times those of a decade ago , industry , must do three times the business of former years . This is precisely what has happened in General Motors and other corporations . Where General Motors did a business of less than $2 billion in a pre-war peak year , it is now doing $5.7 billion , or just as much more as its requirements demand . Profits must be correspondingly high , since a large part of costs are relatively static and have to be met regardless of how well or poorly business is in a given year . Besides , high earnings siphoned off in crushing taxes enable Uncle Sam to live in the style to which he and his bureaucratic family have become accustomed these past seventeen years . Real Conditions It is in the light of these facts that the advances of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . The bigger these advances in terms of both productivity and profits , the greater the advantage for the body economic and its components . Such a perspective is also necessary in view of forthcoming contract negotiations and the certainty that organized labor will press for higher wages and other benefits . This writer , in common with most citizens , favors high wages and improved economic security . However , such gains must be grounded in real and actual conditions , not in a make-believe prosperity based on big talk and inflated figures . In short , what we need is a mature approach to the economic problems of the nation , not an exercise in mutual admiration and hearty back-slapping . Why the American press and radio ? with few notable exceptions  --  fell flat on their collective faces in their interpretation of the facts of industrial life in 1949 is a question that cries for an answer . Perhaps the Washington soothsayers and peddlers of economic dope have one . ALEXANDER S. LIPSETT New York , April 7 , 1950 . Dr. Lorch Commended To THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State College were heartened by the excellent news article of April 10 and the editorial of April 11 in THE NEW YORK TIMES on the Lorch case . It is clear to us here that Dr. Lorch is. being dropped because of his public activities , notably at Stuyvesant Town , against racial discrimination . As close associates of Dr. Lorch we are in a position to attest to his mathematiFEil and teaching ability , and to the fact that he is personally liked and has excellent relations with his colleagues . On these matters his qualifications are unquestionable , and could never be an issue . It seems to us that a dismissal of this type damages the ideal of a university as a center of intellectual life , unrestricted investigation , and criticism . EDWIN J. A.KUTOWICZ , JULIAN IL BLAU , Assistant Professors of Mathematics , Pennsylvania State College . State College , Pa. , April 12 , 1950 . E. 0 . A. and American Interests To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TIMES : In view of its broad experience in international affairs , many will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that " we can not much longer reconcile continuing vast E. C. A. aid to Britain if it is * * * misused in an attempt to create an artificial economic bloc at the expense of the United ' States , " one is tempted to ask a question . Why not stop all E. C. As aid to Britain now , or to any WWI. nation which refuses to use these ion . siderable funds in a manner compatible with American interests ? That is the quickest and surest way of enabling those who pay the piper to call the tune . There is massive evidence to etiP ? port the belief that our meddling is European problems ever since 1915 has ' not been the best or cheapest way ' Of avoiding the theoretical consequences of a more independent position . After our resources are exhausted propping up half the rest of the world , who will provide the crutch for Uncle Sam ? Not the British , French or Chinese . It will be every man for himself , as usual . RILEY M. BATES . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquiry on McCarthy Charges Committee to Look Into Matter Is Advocated Minus Politics To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Twos : If a member of Parliament in H made charges on the floor of Ake House similar to those made by Senator McCarthy , the Government would , with the concurrence of the Opposition , appoint a Royal Commission of Inquiry whose terms of reference would be to collect all available evidence , evaluate it and make a report to the Government , which the Government would submit to the House for a debate and disposition . The chairman of the commission would most probably be a justice of the High Court , either retired or still on the bench , and other members would likely be a few retired statesmen no longer active in politics . The British public as well as Parliament would be quite content that the commission , by the very nature of its composition , would investigate the charges impartially behind closed , doors to protect both the innocent and those who must be regarded innocent unless found blameworthy . The commission would follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings would be above political considerations . This procedure has worked satisfactorily in England in the best interest of the country , and the fact prompts me to suggest that some such plan is worth adopting here . It is much better , I think , than the one suggested recently by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , for the obvious reason that as long as you have party members in a committee of inquiry they are prone to inject politics to take advantage of the situation one way or the other , and the committee findings would be divided along party lines . My suggestion , for what it is worth , is that either Herbert Hoover , who is assuredly now above politics and beyond any political ambitions , or a justice of the United States Supreme Court whose position and prestige are equally beyond partisan reproach %hould be appointed a committee of one with a voluntary staff composed of a few members of the American Bar Association , selected jointly by whoever is to head the committee and the president of the association . To this committee Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-touted " files " with the complete assurance that their contents would not be misused or um . judiciously made public . What is more important , the proceedings of the committee would not be turned into ? circus . This Is the only way , it seems to me , to get at the truth of Senator Mo . Carthy 's blanket charges , and the report of such a committee a inquiry would be accepted by the American people without anybody holloing poll j tics . MICHAEL YOUNG . New York , April 7 , 1950 . In Praise of American Wines To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Timms : Recently THE TIMES carried an article with the headline , " White Wine ; Of 1947 From Europe Extolled as Teri Great ' by Expert . " It is a pity that the excellent California white wines are so neglected in this country . During the years I lived in Germany I liked very much the wines of the Moselle and Rhine valleys . Since coming to this country I drink California white Rhine wine and I cos. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhine wines . There is another important point : a gallon of California Rhine wine Oaks $2.72 , tax included . This is about in , - third the cost of German Moselle Wine . I have no connection with any Amer. scan winemakers ; I am merely an Individual who likes California wine and resents one-sided propaganda for German wines . LUDWIG BAER . Forest Hills , N.
