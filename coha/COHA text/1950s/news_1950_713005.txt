txt DISMISSAL URGED FOR 13,000 ALIENS U. S. HIRES ABROAD Senate Group Calls for Their Replacement by Americans in All Diplomatic Missions WOULD TIGHTEN SECURITY , Green , Lodge , After Study , Say Persons Not Fully Cleared Have Access to Secrets By WILLIAM S. WHITE Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , June 14 ? A two-man Senate group called today for the discharge of the 13,000 aliens employed in United ? States diplomatic missions overseas and their replacement by American citizens to heighten the security of this country 's secrets . Senators Theodore Francis Green , Democrat of Rhode Island , and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , Republican of Massachusetts , made this recommendation after an eleven-day inspection of precautions taken by the State Department abroad against Communist espionage . While they praised the alertness and ability of American security officers here and in Europe , Senators Green and Lodge asserted that in many cases aliens whose loyalty to the West had not been fully investigated had " access to classified ( secret ) material . " In Germany , they said , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charwomen " have access to virtually all rooms in the American headquar- , ters and are not watched while , working , either by American or , German guards . " The two Senators were assigned to make the inquiry in Europe by the Senate Foreign RelaktinkUb-1 committee that is investigating the charges of Senator . Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin , of Communist penetration of the State Department . Both are members of the subcommittee . Building Ownership Urged Apart from recommending the dismissal of all alien personnel in American embassies , consulates and the like , they said it was . " desirable " that the United States should own , rather than lease , its buildings abroad , - so that special construction could be arranged " for such sensitive areas as code and cryptographic rooms . " They made no estimate of the cost of such a program , or of the cost of filling all clerical and similar posts with American citizens . About 1,000 of the 10,000 aliens employed in Germany had been " screened , " Senators Lodge and Green asserted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty of about 2,000 American employes since Dec. 1 , 1949 . " It , is believed , " they added ; " that it will take four to six months to screen the rest ; provision should be made to hasten this . " " In the Embassy in Paris , 50 per cent of the employes are aliens , " they continued . " There are a number of offices in the American headquarters in Berlin , such as the Office of Labor Affairs and the Office of Political Affairs , where there are no American secretaries at all , and where they are urgently needed because of the presence of highly classified material . " The Soviet establishments // abroad , on the other hand , so far as is known , are completely staffed by Russians . " Other Proposals Set . Forth The two Senators made the following recommendations : 1 . Appointment of professional full-time security officers every major American diplomatic post abroad to supplant men who in most cases are " not professional investigators . " 2 . Special training in Washington for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system making jit certain that the State Department would learn of every recommendation offered by any security officer abroa  --  to his local superior , such as Ambassador . 4 . " Precise and well-organised course " in Communist techniques b ? given to all security officers before leaving the United States for foreign posts . " 5 . Replacement of civilian guards by Marine Corps guards at all United States embassies and legations. 6 . " Screening " of all alien servants and drivers of American officials abroad . 7 . Appointment of additional regional security officers to make possible more frequent investigations by them of individual posts . 8 . Careful application of " a rule of reason " in security matters to end a " tendency " to put on documents generally a great deal higher classification of secrecy than they might deserve . 9 . Appointment of additional security officers in the Washington and New York offices of the State Department . 10 . Elimination of the State Department 's Office of Consular Affairs , headed by Samuel D. Boykin , from security matters , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peurifoy , Deputy Under Secretary of State , rather than indirectly on Mr. Peurifoy through Mr. Boykin . " It appears to this , subcommittee , " Messrs . Green and Lodge said , " that the title ' Office of Consular Affairs ' is not only misleading but relegates security to a minor post , when nowadays it should hold a more important place . " The day brought no decision in the effort of twenty-one Republican Senators , headed by Senator Homer Capehart of Indiana , to force a separate inquiry into the Amerasia case of 1945 by a committee other than the Foreign Relations subcommittee investigating the McCarthy charges . That subcommittee is headed by Senator Millard E. Tydings , Democrat of Maryland . It has been making an inquiry into the episode , which involved the unlawful possession of secret Government documents found in the New York offices of the magazine Amerasia , as a part of its broader inquiry . Vice President Alben W. Barkley withheld a decision on whether to refer the resolution proposing a new investigation to the Judiciary Committee , as the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats would prefer . Pervert Inquiry Ordered WASHINGTON , June 14 ( UP ) ? A Senate subcommittee was ordered today to investigate police reports that about 3,500 Sex perverts hold Federal jobs , some of them in the State Department . The go-ahead was given by the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Department to its " super " investigating subcommittee . Authority for the inquiry has been given by the Senate . Heading the group will be Senator Clyde R. Hoey , Democrat of North Carolina , who handled last summer 's investigation of Washington " five per centers . " He said that the new study would be " complete and thorough " and " the paramount objective is to protect the Government and the public interest . " The subcommittee intends to make " every effort to obtain all of the pertinent facts , " but it will not " transgress individual rights " or " subject any individual to ridicule , " he asserted . Mr. Hoey further promised that he would not " allow this investigation to become a public spectacle . " Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed Senator McCarthy on the panel . The latter has asserted that . Communists , perverts and other security risks infest the State Department . He bowed out of the inquiry to avoid being in a position of judging his own accusations . Senator Margaret Chase Smith , Republican of Maine , another regular . member of the investigating group , did not ask to be disqualified and will serve . Other members of the panel are Senators John L. McClellan of Arkansas , James 0 . Eastland of Mississippi and Herbert R. O'Conor of Maryland , Democrats , and Karl E. Mundt , Republican of South Dakota . Chile Wire , Postal Strike Ends SANTIAGO , Chile , June 14 ( 1P ) ?
