It was enough to make old-style intellectuals blink . Of all people , the majority of Oxford undergraduates ( 51% of the men and 62% of the women ) are going to church regularly , praying and thinking about God . Not only that , according to a survey by Cherwell , an undergraduate magazine , but 29% of the men and 45% of the women in the university say that their faith had been strengthened while they were at Oxford . " It does seem , " editorialized Cherwell , " that there has been a religious revival . " <P> So it does . Each Sunday the services at St. Ebbe 's , St. Aldate 's , St. Mary Magdalene , Pusey House and the Wesley Memorial Church are packed with young Oxonians . Sunday evening sermons at St. Mary the Virgin , the university church , are drawing record crowds , and 200-300 mimeographed copies of a sermon are likely to be snatched up within a few hours of delivery . About one student in six is estimated to be a member of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed at the university each year . Says the Rev. Roy Stuart Lee , vicar of St. Mary the Virgin : " The best minds are turning most seriously to religion . " <P> The faculty has joined in the new mood - notably the scientists . " Religion used to be disreputable-a slur on the intellect , " says History Don Harry Pitt , fellow of Worcester College . " We now feel that the brain need not be pulpy to embrace religion . " <P> For all the facts and figures . Oxonians were arguing last week-among the believers themselves-as to whether a real revival was going on . Said third-year student Tony Jaffe : " Religion is just the fashionable thing nowadays , keeping up with the Joneses . The churches are becoming sociable meeting places . Anyone who pretends to be anyone just has to go . There is more interest in the humor of the preacher than in the purpose of the congregation . Perhaps it 's a release from neurosis as well . The pace of Oxford life is killing . " <P> Some feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-consciousness about Oxford 's identification with past movements , i.e. , the Oxford Movement ( Keble , Newman , Pusey ) , the Frank Buchman " Oxford Group " - Moral Re-Armament , the pacifism of the ' 30s . Whatever the reticence , churchgoing is at a new high level . " It 's quite a relief , " said one staunch Anglican last week . " Let them have all the bun fights they want . At least , nobody any longer believes that religion is the haven of anti-intellectual obscurantism. "
