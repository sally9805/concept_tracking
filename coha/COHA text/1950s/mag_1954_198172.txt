Knowing this , publishers try to get their most handsome volumes into the stalls just before Christmas ( about 25% of all trade sales in the U.S. are made in December ) . This season has already brought a flood of books not only good to read but good to hold and to look at . A sampling of the best : <P> AMERICAN SCIENCE AND INVENTION , by Mitchell Wilson ( 437 pp. ; Simon &; Schuster ; $10 ) , tells in 1,200 pictures and clear , knowledgeable text the mighty success story of U.S. gadgeteers , scientists and inventors , from Ben Franklin and his kite to the nuclear fission boys . <P> BOOK OF NURSERY AND MOTHER GOOSE RHYMES , illustrated by Marguerite de Angeli ( 192 pp. ; Doubleday ; $5 ) , is the kind of book that an adult takes from a sleeping child and leafs through with unashamed nostalgia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry B.
