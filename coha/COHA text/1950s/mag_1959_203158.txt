Busy , ancient ( 78 ) Pope John XXIII acted again last week to strengthen the Curia-administrative headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church-which has suffered in recent years from understaffing and old age . For Dec. 14 the Pope called a consistory ( his second ) at which eight new cardinals will be created , raising the membership of the Sacred College to 79 , the largest in history . <P> Two of the new cardinals will be U.S. citizens , bringing U.S. membership in the college to an alltime high of six-ranking in number of cardinals third ( after France with seven and ahead of Spain 's five ) . Italy will have 31 Italians in the college , as opposed to 48 non-Italians . <P> One of the Americans had been virtually sure to get a red hat : Archbishop Albert Gregory Meyer , 56 , appointed last September to succeed Chicago 's late Samuel Cardinal Stritch as head of the largest Catholic archdiocese in the U.S. ( 1,942,000 members ) . Shy , scholarly Archbishop Meyer , son of a Milwaukee grocer , is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chicago he refused to say whether he would transfer his allegiance from the Milwaukee Braves to the Chicago Cubs . Met by a crowd of newsmen and clerics at a Chicago airport last week , as he returned from Washington , Meyer chomped his chewing gum vigorously . " Of course , I am happy for myself , " he said , " but I am even happier for the people of Chicago . We must be even more dedicated now . " Archbishop Meyer is expected to be the only one of the new cardinals who will not be assigned to the Curia in Rome . The second American to get a red hat was also born and bred in Milwaukee ; Aloysius Joseph Muench , 70 , the first U.S. citizen to be an accredited diplomatic representative of the Vatican . Pope Pius XII made him apostolic visitor to Germany in 1946 , raised him to archbishop in 1950 and apostolic nuncio in 1951 . As the first foreign diplomat to present his credentials to the German Federal Republic in 1951 , stocky , grey-haired Archbishop Muench became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folksy Midwestern humor have made him popular . Once when Chancellor Adenauer admired a purple cape he was wearing , Muench said : " I 'll see that you get something purple , " promptly delighted the Chancellor with a necktie made of the same material . <P> Other red hats will go to : <P> MONSIGNOR WILLIAM THEODORE HEARD , 75 , a convert from the Church of Scotland ( as a 26-year-old lawyer ) to Catholicism , who will be the first Scottish cardinal since the death of Charles Cardinal Erskine in 1811 . " He may also , " speculated the London Times , " be the first Oxford rowing Blue in the history of the Church to achieve the purple . " Since 1927 Heard has served at the Vatican on the Sacred Roman Rota , the high ecclesiastical court that passes on applications for marriage annulments . The Vatican expects Pope John to make use of Monsignor Heard 's legal abilities in preparing for the forthcoming Ecumenical Council .                 @ @ @ @
