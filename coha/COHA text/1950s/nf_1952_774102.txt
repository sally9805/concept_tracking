The Normans , now become Christians , often made pilgrimages to the shrine of St. Michael in Apulia in southern Italy . In 1017 some Norman pilgrim-knights took part in a local conflict at Bari and terrified their foes by their ferocity as fighters . The success of the Norman fighting men in southern Italy attracted others to the spot , including several sons of Tancred . One of these , Robert Guiscard , became leader of the Norman adventurers in their attacks upon the lands which still acknowledge the suzerainty of the Byzantine emperor . With the help of his Norman fellows , Robert made himself 4 Duke of Apulia . But the destruction of life and property in the course of these conquests was such that , responding to the appeal of the people , Pope Leo IX obtained troops from Henry III and led them against the Normans . The papal army was defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However the Christian Normans treated the pope with much respect and released him . Hildebrand was at the time adviser to the pope in Rome . He recognized that the Normans were too firmly established to be ousted by force . He therefore decided that more could be done with them as friends than as enemies . The papacy reversed its policy and concluded a treaty with the Normans in 1059 . Under the treaty the pope acknowledged the title of the Normans to southern Italy and to Sicily ( which was in Moslem hands and remained to be conquered ) which they were to hold as a papal fief and for which they were to pay the pope feudal dues . As vassal of the pope the duke promised to protect the pope and the papal states and to assist in forwarding the Cluniac reform program . The warlike energies of the Normans were thus turned against the Moslems in Sicily . HENRY IV AND GERMANY Henry IV ( 1056 ? 1106 ) took over the duties of the German kingship when he reached the age of eighteen in 1o6g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for we saw earlier how the German kings had used the church lands to strengthen the royal power . Many of the secular nobles of Germany were suspicious of  | the growing power of the monarch and rather inclined to resent any extension of kingly authority . In 1075 Pope Gregory issued the decree which declared illegal the lay investiture of bishops in their lands and offices . It was not to be assumed that Henry would meekly acquiesce and permit his supporters to be dismissed from their offices and fiefs . When the archbishopric of Milan fell vacant , Henry acted promptly and invested his own candidate in the office before the pope had time to act . The issue was now fairly joined . Gregory summoned Henry to Rome to answer for his act . Henry called together the German clergy at Worms in 1076 and these friends of the king declared the pope deposed . Gregory replied by excommunicating the emperor ; this act made him an outlaw from Christian society and dissolved the oaths of fealty taken by his vassals . The pope had acted shrewdly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be only too glad to break the power of the German king . He also knew that despite their dependence upon Henry many of the clergy would support the pope . Faced with civil war , Henry acted promptly . He crossed the Alps into Italy and appeared before the pope at Canossa as a humble penitent seeking forgiveness for his sins . On three successive days the emperor stood barefooted in the snow before the castle in which the pope was housed . What a contrast this to the relationship that had existed between emperor and pope from the days of Otto I to Henry III ! As a priest the pope could scarcely refuse to pardon the penitent ruler . Henry 's act , although humiliating , was good statesmanship . By it he immediately resumed his position as king and emperor and was given time to prepare more skillful measures against the Cluniac reform . So ably did he consolidate his position that when the pope again excommunicated him in 108o , Germany remained loyal to the emperor . He then crossed the Alps with an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress of St. Angelo and sent urgent appeals for help to his Norman vassals . As the Normans advanced Henry IV retreated . But when the Normans entered Rome they plundered the city for three days . So indignant were the citizens  | against the pope , whom they blamed for this outrage , that when the Normans withdrew , Gregory had to leave the city with them . At Salerno , this carpenter 's son who had risen through the church to the position of highest authority , who had beheld the emperor a supplicant before him , died an exhausted and saddened man . After the death of Gregory the investiture question was compromised , not settled . For the interest of Europe was drawn away to matters of more immediate concern to all . These were the Crusades . The Crusades LESS THAN a quarter century after Mohammed 's death the assassination of Othman ( 644 ? 656 ) precipitated a civil war among his followers . The division was healed outwardly at least when the Omayyad family established their right to the Caliphate and moved the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet , continued to insist that the descendants of Ali and Mohammed 's daughter Fatima were the rightful leaders of Islam . In 750 the Omayyads were overthrown in a palace revolt . All the Omayyad princes were slain except one , Abd-er-Raman ( Abdurrahman ) who succeeded in escaping to Spain . At Cordova he established a new caliphate which he ruled as an independent state . The new non-Arab rulers in the East were the Abbasid family who transferred the capital from Damascus to Baghdad . This disruption of the religious and political unity of Islam was symptomatic of a tendency which greatly weakened the Mohammedan power . Nevertheless the Moslem world continued to enjoy great prosperity . Although the Emirs or local governors quarreled with one another and ruled as little independent princes , trade and commerce prospered . Al- though by the beginning of the tenth century the Baghdad caliphs were mere puppets controlled by military chieftains , the Moslem world continued to exhibit great cultural and economic vigor . The Turks , dwelling in central Asia north of the Altai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eastern and western group . The western Turks , weakened by wars with their kinsmen and with China , were conquered-by the Arabs during the era of Mohammedan expansion . But as the political unity of the Arab empire was destroyed , the Turkish chieftains led their warlike tribesmen against the Moslem Emirates of western Asia . Seljuk was their leader and as a result they became known as the Seljuk Turks . The Turkish tribesmen embraced Mohammedanism with the fanaticism which so often characterizes the new convert . This did not prevent them making war on . their fellow Mohammedans however . By the end of the first half of the eleventh century , the grandson of Seljuk had overthrown the local chieftain and established his control over the Baghdad caliph . His son in turn subjugated Persia and Armenia and defeated the army of the eastern Roman emperor at Manzikert in 1071 . The coming of the Turks brought.about a sudden change in the relationship that had grown up between Christianity and Islam . For while the two civilizations had remained generally hostile to each other ? Moslem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maritime cities of Italy retaliated with increasing lil vigor ? European pilgrims visiting the Christian shrines in Palestine and other Moslem-dominated regions were allowed to come and go in peace and the Christian subjects of Moslem rulers were detently treated . The Turks changed all this . Their successful attacks on the Byzantine empire threatened the destruction of eastern Christendom . Many tales began to reach Europe of atrocities inflicted upon pilgrims and upon the Christian subjects of Turkish rulers . This was the situation when the Byzantine emperors appealed to the West for help . There was good reason to believe that such help might be effectively given . An active crusade was in progress against the Moors in Spain . The Italian cities , particularly Genoa and Pisa , had built up their fleets and in 1084 captured the important Moslem stronghold   of Tunis in north Africa . In I072 the Normans took Palermo and in Io91 they completed their conquest of Sicily . THE COUNCIL OF CLERMONT In 1094 the eastern emperor Alexius renewed the appeal to western Christendom addressing his plea to Pope Urban II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great church council which was attended by many nobles and clergy . Toward the close of the session Pope Urban addressed the gathering and proposed a crusade against the Moslems . It was a great speech . Several accounts of it have come down to us . From them we obtain a very clear picture of the situation of Europe at the end of the eleventh century and of the many motives which prompted the military undertakings we know as the Crusades . The pope pointed out that constant feuds among the European nobles imposed suffering and hardship upon the people of Europe and availed the nobles little . Population had increased to a point where there were not enough fiefs for the noble offspring and destruction of crops had sharpened the threat of famine . He proposed that the nobles call a truce to their private quarrels and direct their warlike energies toward freeing the Holy Land from Mohammedan domination and to rescuing the eastern empire from the Turkish threat . Knowing men , the pope added for the benefit of those who might not be sufficiently stirred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wealthy East many might obtain for themselves lands and riches that no longer could be acquired in Europe . He ended his address with a moving portrayal of the sufferings of the eastern Christians . Great numbers immediately took the pledge to go on a crusade and it was arranged that the armies would set out the following year . THE FIRST CRUSADE The pope had addressed himself to the nobles , the fighting men of Europe , for this was to be a military enterprise . But the extraordinary enthusiasm aroused by his appeal communicated itself immediately to others . At once self-appointed agitators like Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless went about among the peasants stirring up enthusiasm for a crusade . Great numbers of these poor   folk packed their families and worldly goods upon carts and , with no notion of the distance to be traveled or of the difficulties to be net with , started off to the East . As this unorganized rabble passed through Hungary and Bulgaria , living on the country as they traveled , the Christian inhabitants of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of the crusading group died or became lost on the way . Two croups got through to Constantinople arriving in July 1096 . We may imagine the feelings of the emperor Alexius when the rabble descended upon his city . He helped them cross over into Asia Minor where they were cut to pieces by the Turks . In the autumn of 1096 the first of the crusading armies reached Constantinople . The last arrived in the spring of the following year . At once it became apparent that the purpose of the Crusade was one thing to Alexius and quite another to the European nobles . The emperor desired his European allies to restore Asia Minor and Syria to the empire . He was not particularly interested in driving the Moslems out of Palestine for it was a poor country and difficult to defend . The Europeans , on the other hand , were not particularly oncerned with Alexius ' problems . Their purpose was to free the Holy Land and to carve out fiefs for themselves in the Near East . As the western armies arrived Alexius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any of the former territories of the empire which they might conquer . The crusading leaders bitterly resented the emperor 's tactics and there were occasional violent outbreaks between the crusaders and the Greeks ? Greek was the language of the Eastern Roman Empire and its people were accordingly referred to as Greeks by the Latin Christians . But the crusaders were dependent upon the emperor for guides , siege machinery , and . t supporting fleet with supplies . With bad grace they acceded to Alexius ' demands . In April 1097 the crusaders began to cross into Asia Minor . The first Turkish stronghold they encountered was the former Byzantine i ity of Nicaea . But when the walls were breached the garrison surrendered , by previous arrangement , to the Greeks rather than to the rusaders and the Europeans were thus prevented from plundering t he city . Alexius overcame the indignant anger of their leaders with gifts and promises and the armies set out upon their arduous march cross Asia Minor . At Dorylaeum the crusaders were ambushed by the Turks who , lightly armored and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoided coming to close grips with the heavy armored crusaders . The expedition was saved from disaster by a well-timed charge of the Norman knights . The crusaders , with their woolen and leather garments , heavy armor , and a shortage of pack animals , suffered acutely throughout the whole campaign from heat , shortage of supplies , disease , and the rigors of the march . When the Taurus Mountains were crossed the ambition of many of the crusading princes made itself evident in an immediate scramble for fiefs . Baldwin of Flanders , the landless brother of Godfrey of Bouillon , seized the strategic city of Edessa . THE SIEGE OF ANTIOCH In October 1097 the crusaders laid siege to the great walled city of Antioch in northern Syria . The crusaders were too few in number to surround the city completely and supplies steadily reached the garrison while the attackers suffered through the winter from lack of food , clothing , and shelter . In the spring reinforcements arrived . Then Bohemund , the Norman leader , bribed a dissatisfied Turkish officer to admit his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time , for four days later a Turkish army arrived outside the city and the crusaders , instead of being cut to pieces outside the walls , found themselves besieged in the captured city . They were exhausted from their sack of the city and were still without food and supplies . Their leaders , greedy for fiefs , squabbled over the possession of Antioch . Morale was at low ebb and many crusaders lowered themselves over the walls on ropes during the night and tried to escape through the Turkish lines to the coast . Among these was Peter the Hermit . When the crusaders ' plight seemed most desperate a pious monk , Peter Bartholomew , was inspired by a vision to discover the lance which had pierced the side of Jesus as He hung on the cross . The discovery immediately revived the flagging spirits of the crusaders . They issued from the city suddenly and fell upon the Turks , completely defeating them . In 1099 the rank and file of the army , thoroughly sickened by the quarreling of their leaders , threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem . The march was resumed and in June the army arrived before the Holy City . Reinforcements and supplies had reached the crusaders by sea and tliu  | siege was brief . In the moment of their triumph the crusaders avenged themselves upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem for all the hardship and despair they had suffered during the two years past . I n an enthusiastic letter to the pope , Godfrey of Bouillon wrote that the horses ' legs were reddened to the knees from wading among the bodies of the slain . THE CRUSADING STATES European feudalism was at once established in Palestine and Syria . Romanesque churches and feudal castles appeared . The conquered territories were carved up into fiefs and these were subdivided among vassals . Godfrey of Bouillon , who died in t too , was succeeded by his brother Baldwin , already Count of Edessa , who became King of Jerusalem . Bohemund held the Principality of Antioch . Raymond of Toulouse created for himself the County of I'ripoli . Jerusalem remained in the hands of the crusaders from 1099 to 1187 . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And materials back and forth between Europe and the East . : . o longer was the Mediterranean a Mohammedan lake . The cities of southern Europe built fleets and grew rich upon the traffic in men : ind goods . Europe found an outlet for her surplus commodities and Europeans developed a taste for the eastern products they had so long been deprived of . While Europe 's fighting men sought careers and lands in the East those who remained at home enjoyed comparative peace and security . Absent nobles often placed their fiefs in the custody of the church and the skillful management of church administrators much improved the condition of these lands and of the people living on them . The Peace of God and the Truce of God were extended throughout Europe and contributed much to the welfare of all . These measures represented the efforts of the church to restrict feudal warfare . The Peace of God , introduced around 990 , was a flan whereby the church sought to win from the nobles a promise I of to attack women , children , pilgrims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monasteries , crops and cattle and farm implements . The Truce of God , introduced about 1025 , SUSpended fighting on Friday , Saturday , and Sunday . Later it was extended to include " closed seasons " like Lent .  | While the nobles were the mounted fighters and leaders of the crusading armies , the " rank and file " was made up of members of the Third Estate . Many peasants undertook pilgrimages to the Holy Land . Some remained in the East . Others returned and settled in the growing towns where they became traders or craftsmen . Travel in Europe became relatively safe and the manor was no longer so completely isolated from the larger world as it had been . The development of a closer , more interdependent , European community was tremendously accelerated by the crusades . THE CRUSADES CONTINUE In 1147 an energetic Turkish leader , Zangi , captured Edessa . Europe was at once aroused by the new Turkish threat to the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem . The Second Crusade was preached by the eloquent monk Bernard of Clairvaux who addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1146 . King Louis V I I of France and many of his nobles took the crusading pledge . In Germany the Emperor Conrad III placed himself at the head of a group of German crusading knights . The Second Crusade was a miserable failure . Conrad and his Germans were the first to reach the East . They suffered a series of defeats . Upon the arrival of King Louis and the French army the crusade was resumed . The crusaders laid siege to Damascus but failed to take the city . The discouraged monarchs returned home with the remnants of their armies . Forty years after the fall of Edessa Western Christendom was electrified by the tidings that Jerusalem had been seized by the great Mohammedan leader Saladin . The tragic news was carried westward in a ship with black sails . In response to the appeal of the pope the three leading rulers of Europe took the Crusaders ' Cross . They were Frederick Barbarossa of Germany , Philip Augustus of France , and Richard the Lion Hearted of England . The formidable German army was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sudden and unexpected . Frederick was drowned while bathing in a stream and his exhausted and discouraged followers turned back and abandoned the crusade . The French and English kings arrived together by sea and joined the siege of Acre which had been going on for two years . Saladin arrived with his army and be . sieged the besiegers by surrounding their armies .  | Philip seems to have regretted his decision to go on a crusade ; almost from the start . His interests lay at home . He quarreled with Richard and at the first opportunity returned home because of " illness . " It might have been a good thing for England had Richard alone likewise . Instead Richard left England in the care of his brother John and continued in his role of crusader . He was a man 01 great personal courage and a doughty warrior . Much inferior to Saladin in intelligence and humaneness , he nevertheless won the respect of his great adversary through his qualities as a warrior . In 1 193 a truce was arranged under which the Christians held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the Holy Land for pilgrims . Richard returned home and the following year Saladin ( lied . THE PAPACY AND THE FOURTH CRUSADE Pope Urban II had launched the First Crusade . Its success brought great prestige to the papacy . During the crusading era the popes were the real heads of Western Christendom . No emperor launched a crusade . When Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa took the Cross they did so as German rulers and were only equal in authority to the other national monarchs who participated along with them ? Louis VII , Philip Augustus , Richard of England . The esence of the more adventuresome nobles from Europe gave the popes the opportunity they had long sought after to re-establish their control over the clergy and over church lands . The reform movelent and the extension of the Peace and Truce of God greatly strengthened popular support of the new papal authority . And a , cries of able popes exercised their authority with good effect . Pope Innocent III ( 1198-1216 ) was the most powerful ruler of his day . He conceived that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between God and men . As ruler over the souls of men his authority was greater than that of king or emperor who ruled merely over their bodies . With Innocent this was no empty theoretial claim . He did not hesitate to make his authority felt . The church had no armies with which to discipline rulers who might choose to disregard or to defy her authority . But the church possessed powerful spiritual weapons . Chief among them was excommunication and the interdict . By excommunication an individual was declared expelled and outlawed from Christian society and  | his soul was condemned to Hell for all eternity . If a ruler were excommunicated his subjects no longer owed him obedience ; his vassals were immediately relieved of all their feudal obligations to him . An excommunicated man was outside the protection of the law and might be injured or hunted with impunity . The interdict was the suspension of all church offices and of the services of the clergy in the district to which the ban was applied . Administration of the sacraments was suspended . This meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that marriages would not be sanctified , that infants would not be baptized , that the dying were deprived of the last rites of the church and final forgiveness for sins . In an age of faith these were terrible weapons indeed . And in addition Innocent did not hesitate to depose kings and to call for crusades against rebellious rulers . Whereas in former times emperors had chosen popes , Innocent was called upon to decide who should be emperor . Philip Augustus of France , Alfonso IX of Leon , King John of England , all were forced finally to submit to the will of Innocent III ; John surrendered England to the pope and received it back as a fief for which English kings paid feudal dues to Rome until 1366 . We shall have occasion to refer to these matters again . In 1202 Innocent issued a call for a crusade . No particular crisis or danger had prompted this call and the response was small . The French nobles who took the Cross decided to go by sea and to attack Egypt which had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport the crusaders for 85,000 marks which was a price of two marks a man and four marks a horse . But when the crusaders arrived in Venice they were fewer in number than had been anticipated and could pay only 51,000 marks . While the Venetians held the crusaders as " guests " on one of the ' islands of their city , they negotiated a contract by which the crusad. ers agreed to attack the Dalmatian city of Zara , a commercial riv of Venice . Of course Zara , a Christian city , belonged to the Catholic king of Hungary who was himself a crusader , but that did not . trouble the Venetians . Zara was taken and the pope excommuni. cated the Venetians . This did not seem to bother them either for they had a still more interesting proposal to put to the crusaders . Although enjoying a profitable trade with Constantinople and the Byzantine umpire , the Venetians desired a monopoly . They now  | proposed that the crusaders join them in attacking Constantinople and restoring to the throne the emperor Isaac II and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution . Alexius promised money and fiefs to the crusaders and overcame their religious , scruples by agreeing to bring about the submission of the Greek church to Rome thereby uniting eastern and western Christendom wider the headship of the pope . Constantinople was taken and Isaac and his son were placed pon the throne . The city rose in revolt and drove them out but the rusaders retook the city and submitted it to a pillage that was one f the most disgraceful in history . Some of the crusaders obtained efs which they and their descendants held for another fifty years . ut the Venetians profited greatly . They took possession of strategic lands and ports and a large section of the city of Constantinople self . Their conquest secured them a predominance in eastern commerce which they held until the age of discoveries opened up new ade routes around Africa . THE CHILDREN 'S CRUSADE The diversion of the Fourth Crusade and the attacks upon the . Christian cities of Zara and Constantinople did much to discredit i movement and to undermine enthusiasm for any future under . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the ' stern Mohammedans but they achieved little or nothing . Howver , mention should be made of a strange phenomenon of the age f Innocent III , the Children 's Crusade , for it will help us to realize ow different was the outlook of the men of that day from those of ur own time . In 1212 a young shepherd boy , Stephen of Vendome , preached a crusade to the children , declaring that God would open a path rough the sea for them as he had for the Israelites of old . Many children left their homes and followed Stephen to Marseilles where Dme merchants agreed to transport them to Palestine . A storm vr ? rtook the fleet and two of the ships were sunk with all aboard . the remainder reached an eastern port where the children were Id in the eastern slave markets . Another such expedition left Ger1lariy headed by little Nicholas of Cologne . In the course of the march across the Alps most of the children died of exhaustion and  | hunger . The Italian bishops and the pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return home although a few still persisted in begging passage on eastbound ships . Effects of the Crusades upon Europe THE WHOLE LIFE OF EUROPE was affected by two centuries of crusading activity . It is necessary therefore that we make some estimate of the changes which were brought about in Europe as a result of the crusades . And yet it is extremely difficult to know with any degree of certainty just how much of the change oh . servable during the era was caused by the crusades and how much would have occurred in any event . It can be argued that the course of European development would have been pretty much the same had the crusades never taken place . And since the crusades affected men in all walks of life in all parts of Europe it would be possible to attribute nearly every alteration in the life of Europe to the crusading movement . We must bear these possibilities in mind as we seek to arrive at a common-sense judgment of the influence of the crusades upon the life of Europe . COMMERCIAL EXPANSION The inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the crusades . They transported supplies , re . inforcements , and pilgrims from Europe to the East . Their returning ships brought back spices , cotton , sugar , silks , and much of thr plunder which had been taken from the captured towns of Syria and Palestine . In return for their aid to the crusaders the Italian cities ? principally Genoa , Pisa , and Venice ? were allotted " quar  | ters " in eastern ports which they ruled in free sovereignty . Here they erected wharves , storehouses , offices , and homes for resident merchants . Among the eastern products which found a ready market in Europe were rice , garlic , cotton , silk , maize , muslin , damask , purple dye , glass mirrors , spices , perfumes . Most of these were novelties to Europeans and brought high prices . Europe in turn found profitable eastern markets for such commodities as furs , hides , wool cloth , metals . The Italians developed high skill in refining raw products and in converting them into useful and beautiful articles . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwrought metal . When commercial relationships became stabilized English raw wool was shipped across the Channel to Flanders and the Low Countries where it was spun into yarn and woven into cloth . A portion of the best cloth was then shipped up the Rhine and across the Alps to Italy where , chiefly in Florence , it was dyed and finished . Much of this finished cloth was then loaded on boats and shipped to the East . The remainder was distributed through European markets . In this instance it may be seen how the opening of an eastern market for woolen cloth stimulated the expansion of the Florentine finishing and dyeing crafts , Flemish spinning and weaving , and English wool growing , as well as extending the ac-tivities of all those engaged in transporting the raw , semi-finished , or completed article overland or upon the sea . THE RISE OF THE TOWNS Although town life had not entirely died out during the feudal era the towns were of little importance in the life of Europe during that period . As we saw , the most characteristic form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manor house or the castle of the lord . Manor life was based upon agriculture . A few skilled or semi-skilled craftsmen made shoes and fashioned tools and weapons for the community but even they spent part of their time raising food for their tables . The peasant was attached to the soil . He held a share of the community land which guaranteed him a living for himself and his family . But he was not free to come and go as he chose . In order to leave the village he had to obtain his lord 's permission . Largely self-sufficient and having little contact with even neat  | neighbors , the community tended to produce no more than its needs , for there was little or no profit to be derived from surplus goods . During the period of the crusades many peasants accompanied their noble overlords as servants , archers , and men-at-arms . Many more joined the eastward movement as pilgrims . Large numbers never returned to their homes but settled in the growing towns where there was bustle and activity and many opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The organization and provisioning of the crusades was a stimulation to the economic activity of Europe . As goods and men circulated more freely and securely throughout Europe than they had in the past , merchants established themselves at strategic points and sold or traded their wares with all who came their way . Often a trading population grew up around a fortress or burg and thus were born many modern cities , the names of which end in burg . Merchants often settled at the crossing of a river or at its mouth . They settled near monasteries or at the junction of two or more important routes of travel . The names of many European cities indicate their origins : Bruges ( bridge ) , Stamford , Portsmouth , Bordeaux ( waters ' edge ) . Of course the merchants and traders had to come to terms with the feudal noble upon whose land they settled . This usually meant paying taxes to an overlord in return for protection under the law and the right to do business . In general the feudal baron dealt with the merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within their own town or borough the merchants controlled their own affairs and established their own local government . I ! THE GUILDS 1 The town dwellers banded themselves together into guilds which were occupational organizations . The earlier guilds were the guilds merchant or trade guilds . Later , handcraft or manufacture was organized in the same way . The guilds enjoyed exclusive privileges and definite responsibilities . For example , a shoemakers ' guild might possess the exclusive right to make all the shoes for a give .. community in return for seeing to it that the community was at all times provided with shoes of good workmanship and material at a reasonable price . In order to insure the existence of an adequate supply of skilled  | labor the guild members , " masters " of their craft or trade , took into their shops and homes boys who became apprentices to the trade . While the apprentice learned his craft , the master furnished him room and board . All work done by the apprentice became the property of the master . In other words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a period during which the craftsman sought employment as a journeyman for a daily wage . He was free to move about from town to town . wherever the prospect of employment seemed best . After a number of years during which the journeyman perfected his skill and saved his money , he might become a master craftsman , operate a shop of his own , employ journeymen , and train apprentices . But in order to qualify for full membership as a master in the guild he would hive to complete a " masterpiece , " a difficult piece of work which would display his mastery of his craft . Once accepted he would trey an initiation fee and dues . The guild controlled the number of men who might be employed n ? apprenticed ; this was so that there might not be a surplus or shortage of skilled workers . The guild determined the hours and conditions of labor , inspected the merchandise in the shops in order to see that work and materials were up to standard , and held the trice down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its members . There were social gatherings and entertainments . The guilds set up funds to help their members through periods of illness . The guild member contributed to a fund out t.1 which provision was made for the care and support of widows . c nd orphans of guild members . MONEY There was very little use for money on the medieval manor . A peasant might trade some butter for the eggs from his neighbor 's hens or he might exchange cheese for beer . He paid his feudal dues to his overlord or to the church in commodities and labor . But with the growth of trade during the crusades the convenience money was recognized and many different kinds of coin were inted and put into circulation . These varied greatly in size and u eight and fineness . As a result , the money changers disregarded the face value of coins and rated them according to the value of t I le metals they contained .  | As the papacy re-established its administrative control over the clergy in charge of the churches and monasteries of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the transfer of revenues . The provisioning and financing of the crusades was an important factor in building up this church bureaucracy . Many types of church institutions concerned themselves with crusades and pilgrimages . There were founded crusading orders of monks , among them the Knights Templars and Hospitalers , who protected the pilgrims and helped them on their way . These orders soon became engaged in banking and commercial activities associated with the crusades . For example , it became customary for a crusading noble to deposit funds with a local branch of such an order in exchange for which he would be given an order or draft . This would enable him to withdraw funds from the treasury of an eastern branch of the order when he arrived at his destination . He was thus saved from the bother and risk of carrying the heavy coin with him during his travels where there was always the danger of loss through shipwreck or piracy . Such withdrawls of funds would naturally be balanced against deposits made by other crusaders or merchants traveling in the opposite direction . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for good reason was unable to do so . There were other able-bodied fighters who could not join the crusades because they lacked equipment and funds with which to pay the cost of their transportation . The church arranged that an individual who was prevented from going on a crusade might share in the spiritual benefits of the enterprise if he would equip and finance a fighting man to go in his stead . Let it be remembered that a crusade was a pilgrimage . The hardship endured by the pilgrim was offered up to God in atonement , for the sins he had committed . By the sacrament of penance the repentant sinner , through the agency of the priest , sought God 's forgiveness for his sins . But forgiveness did not immediately relieve the sinner of all of the penalties due to sin . A pilgrimage was one of the forms of sacrifice by which the sinner atoned for sin and cleansed his soul of its taint . Under a special dispensation called an indulgence , the sinner was now permitted to substitute a money sacrifice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when money was difficult to come by such a payment represented a very real sacrifice . And let it be understood this was no purchase of for . giveness for sin . Forgiveness was obtained through the sacrament  | of penance . It is necessary to make this point clear because later on the faithful themselves became confused over the meaning of indulgences . REACTION TO THE NEW AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH In all ages there are those who feel that the church 's activities should be restricted to purely spiritual matters , who feel that somehow or other the church should be able to maintain its organization , carry on its services to the community , dispense charity , maintain churches and monasteries and schools , and protect its jurisdiction , without becoming involved in business or politics . Such a reaction against the " worldly " involvement of the clergy gave rise to the monastic movement during and after the time of Constantine , as we saw . During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , as the church grew powerful and rich , a similar reaction took place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his worldly goods and preached a return to the simple life of the apostolic age . For a while Waldo and his followers , who are known as the Waldensians , had the approval of the pope who was naturally aware that many of the clergy , particularly those in charge of the administration of large benefices , lived more like princes than like churchmen . But the Waldensians soon got into trouble with the local clergy . In denouncing the conduct of worldly and luxury-loving churchmen , the Waldensians began to insist that the faithful were not dependent upon the ministrations of the priest for salvation , that the Bible was the all-sufficient guide to truth and salvation . Thus they denied the necessity of the sacraments and of the priesthood . This was heresy and the Waldensians were condemned by the church . Toward the close of the twelfth century a more extreme heresy arose among a group of reformers in southern France . This became known as the Albigensian heresy because its center was the town of Albi in Toulouse . The Albigensians not only regarded the ministrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very few men were capable of winning salvation in any case . The souls of sinners , the great majority of men , left their human bodies after death and entered the bodies of animals . Sex , said the Albigensians , was the chief instrument of the devil and should be avoided in all forms . The pure eschewed contact with even those  | things that had been produced by sex , hence they refused to cat meat , milk , or eggs . The Albigensian heresy spread so widely throughout southern France that a crusade was organized against them and the sect was finally stamped out by force . Not all reaction against the worldly power of the church was heretical however . Francis , the son of a prosperous merchant of Assisi and a pleasure-loving young man , underwent a spiritual transformation during a period of illness and imprisonment . Ile devoted himself thereafter to a career of poverty and service , preaching and ministering to the sick and unfortunate . His pure life and inspired preaching won him many followers . So great was his influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canonized a saint . St. Dominic was a Spanish priest who visited Toulouse in 1205 . He was troubled by the spread of the Albigensian heresy . Adopting a life of poverty , he traveled about among the towns of Toulouse , endeavoring by his preaching and example to win back the heretics to the Catholic faith . In 1216 the Dominican Order of Friars Preachers was formed . They were much like the Franciscans in that they traveled about among the townspeople and lived upon alms instead of retiring from the world into a monastery . But the Dominican friars , unlike the Franciscans , emphasized the training of the intellect . St. Dominic realized that his preachers would have to be very thoroughly educated in order to meet the subtle arguments of the heretics and to avoid falling unconsciously into heresy themselves . The Dominicans became associated with the Inquisition because of their discipline in church doctrine . The Inquisition , set up in 1233 , was a court . Its purpose was to determine whether a Christian accused of heresy was in fact guilty of holding heretical beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to persuade him to abandon his false beliefs and repent . If he remained obdurate the court turned him over to the secular authority . Death by burning at the stake was usually the punishment meted out to condemned heretics for a heretic was not much different in popular conception from a witch and witches were customarily burned .  | The Flowering of Medieval Civilization IN OUR DAY the words " Middle Ages " are likely to conjure up an unpleasant picture in which are associated feudal warfare and bad plumbing , serfdom and burnings at the stake , ignorance and super , tition . The Middle Ages had their dark side ? what age has not ? But what sense is there in the modern inclination to gaze only upon the dark side of the picture ? Let us recognize that the possession of a tiled bathroom and a high-powered roadster does not make the modern gangster a superior person to Dante or St. Thomas Aquinas . MEDIEVAL EDUCATION The fundamentals of medieval education were the liberal arts . The seven liberal arts were divided into two groups composing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the quadrivium of ; arithmetic , geometry , astronomy , and music . The purpose of medieval education in the liberal arts was to train the intellect . It was not primarily designed to teach a man how to make a living : although it was probably assumed that a man who had learned to think clearly was more likely to succeed in making a decent living than one who was mentally confused . The medieval youth did not tyo to school to learn how to manufacture cloth or to conduct a profitable trade in eastern spices . He acquired those techniques by coming apprenticed to a master in a craft or trade . Latin was the language of the church and of learning in the M iddle Ages . Through a study of the Latin classics the student endeavored to learn how to express himself clearly and accurately .  | Logic or dialectic further developed his thinking processes . Without statistics on medieval education it is impossible to know how many children received some kind of instruction in letters and simple arithmetic . In the towns many were early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth with a good head for figures might find employment keeping the accounts in his lord 's household or upon one of his manors . Many , of course , entered the church , for in the Middle Ages the church performed many services for the community ? like that of education ? which in our time are conducted by the government , and many different kinds of careers were open to men through the church . If a youth chose to follow one of the professions , law or medicine , he would enroll in a university . Were he interested in church law ? canon law ? he would probably go to the University of Paris which in the thirteenth century was the center of theological studies . If the civil law interested him he would undoubtedly select Bologna where he would study the Code of Justinian and thus become acquainted with the great body of Roman law . For the study of medicine the student might choose Salerno , or Padua , or Montpellier in southern France . The universities were the creation of the Middle Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirteenth century . We have mentioned already some of them . Oxford was founded about 1200 by a group from the University of Paris . Cambridge was founded a little later by a group of Oxford men . The University of Naples was founded in 1224 by Frederick II in order to train state officials . The University of Prague was established in 1347 and that of Heidelberg in 1386 . MEDIEVAL LITERATURE Most of the written literature of the Middle Ages was in Latin and much of it dealt with religion . Collections of anecdotes and fables have come down to us . Many medieval hymns are clearly the work of skilled poets . Among the best known medieval historians are Gregory of Tours , who wrote in the sixth century a History of the Franks . In the seventh century Paul the Deacon wrote the History of the Lombards , and the Venerable Bede his Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation in the eighth century . In the crusading era William ,  | archbishop of Tyre , recorded the History of the Kingdom of jerusalem . The crusades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among which are the accounts riven by Villehardouin and de Joinville . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle old English prose is one of the most important historical records of the Middle Ages . It was begun in the reign of Alfred toward the close of the ninth century and was continued for four hundred years . An early masterpiece of vernacular poetry is the early English poem Beowulf which was first written down in the seventh century . Iii the tenth century the Germans recorded in writing the great pic story of the tragedy of Siegfried and Brunhilde , the Nibelungriclied . There were many collections of stories in French known is the chansons de geste , accounts of great deeds . Most famous of these is the Song of Roland concerning the captain in charge of Charlemagne 's rear guard whose force was trapped in the pass of l:oncesvalles in the Pyrenees and slaughtered to the last man . The stories of Tristan and Isolde and King Arthur and his knights are products of the medieval imagination . During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there traveled about Europe in increasing numbers jongleurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and reciting the traditional stories and others of their own devising . Thus there was kept alive and circulated among the people of Europe a literature and music fragments of which were written clown and passed on to us . One of the great poets of the Middle Ages was Dante degli Aighieri ( 1265 ? 1321 ) . His most famous work is the Divine Comedy m which he is taken through Hell , Purgatory , and Paradise . It is thoroughly medieval in the view of the world which it reveals as It is in its quotation of ancient classical writers and the Bible . Phis great poem was not written in Latin however but in the popular language of Tuscany . The early development of a vernacular literature in the Tuscan tongue caused it to become the language of all Italy in preference to other dialects . GOTHIC ART One of the crowning glories of the Middle Ages was its art . The great cathedrals which dot the continent of Europe preserve for  | us overwhelming evidence of the creative imagination and ski of medieval man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built upon Roman models , indeed many of the church of Roman times were originally constructed as pagan temples an later taken over by the Christians . But since the Christian church , unlike the classical temple , was built to house a congregation , th interior space was enlarged by constructing the walls outside th pillars which supported the roof . Whenever church buildings we constructed entirely of stone and covered by a vaulted ceiling , I was necessary to build heavy outer walls to take up the side thrust of the masonry roof . The windows which pierced these thick wal were narrow and as a consequence little light was admitted the interior . In southern Europe where there is an abundance of bright su light during the year , the gloom of the church interior was pleasant relief from the bright glare of the out-of-doors . And the lig filtering in through windows and doors sufficiently illuminated the interior . But in northern Europe the days of bright sunlight were few . Throughout the greater part of the year dark and overcast skies created a problem of lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted the problem of so distri uting the weight of the heavy masonry vaults which covered their buildings as to permit the opening up of large areas of wall space for windows . In solving this problem they created a structure surpassing beauty . In the Gothic church the pointed arch replaced the rounde arch for in this manner the side thrust of the masonry was lessened and the weight was carried more directly to the ground . A series of arched ribs carried the weight of the vaults to points along th walls , and this was concentrated so that slender columns sufficed support a great weight . The side thrust was carried out over th side aisles of the church by devices known as flying buttressc curved ribs which carried the weight outward and downward the ground . The walls between these centers of thrust were thus relieved of the function of supporting the roof . They were accord . ingly removed and replaced by magnificent curtains of stained glass arranged in intricate and many-colored patterns . The effect of great weight that we observe in the massiv Romanesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaults , slender columns , and flying buttresses . An effect of lightness was achieved through the skillful use of decorative detail and the emphasis of vertical lines . Horizontal lines were avoided wherever possible . The surfaces of the building , particularly the facade and towers , were ornamented with intricate carvings and statuary which , At a short distance , produced a lacelike pattern that successfully overcame any remaining effects of heaviness . The Gothic cathedral represented the whole medieval community as no modern building does . Not only was it erected through the many contributions of the faithful of a locality , its erection was a community enterprise too . The citizens hauled the stone and raised the walls under the direction of architects and builders . Each craft and trade contributed its best to the house of God . Weavers , and linters , and wood-carvers , and metal-workers , and masons ? all Fhad a hand in fashioning or equipping the church . And the creative imagination of the individual was not restrained by a detailed plan which must be followed . If a stone-worker were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved such a figure as his mood and fancy suggested . The figure might be rude or humorous or sublime . All this combined effort produced a final result that was at the same time magnificently harmonious and infinitely varied . OTHER ASPECTS It would be possible to dwell at length upon many other aspects of medieval civilization which compel admiration and respect . Early in our century a distinguished historian was so impressed by the achievements of this era that he published a good-sized volume which acclaimed the thirteenth century the greatest in all the long course of human history . We could speak of the restrictions placed upon feudal warfare by the extension of the Peace and Truce of God , or of the way in which the rough fighting nobility were restrained and civilized by the code of chivalry . Very much indeed could be written of the great intellectual achievements of the medieval schoolmen like albertus Magnus , Roger Bacon , and Thomas Aquinas , among whom re some of the greatest minds of all time . It would be interesting to review the efforts through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining a just price for services and commodities .  | One of the chief criticisms leveled at medieval society is that it was impossible for a man born of humble parents to rise in the social scale . The medieval records abound with personal histories which contradict this assertion . The popes themselves often weer of the humblest origins : Alexander V had been a beggar boy , Sixtus IV was the son of a peasant , Urban IV and John XXII were the sons of cobblers , Benedict XI and Sixtus V were shepherds ' son. , and the great Gregory VII was the son of a carpenter . Not that we need exaggerate ; the number of men who from humble hr. ginnings reached positions of distinction and influence in society was very limited . But medieval society was by no means as inflexible as we in our time are likely to think . It is true that men did not enjoy equality before the law . Nor did the great commonalty of men have much to say about their government ? the famous thirteenth century Magna Carta was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a feudal agreement ho . posed by rebellious nobles upon their king . The ideal of human equality is a very new concept among men . It is derived from the Christian teaching reiterated throughout the Middle Ages that the souls of all men are of equal value in the sight of God .  | Capetian France THE NATIONAL STATE THE POLITICAL HISTORY of modern Europe is largely an account of the growth and rivalry of national states . In this it stands in sharp contrast to the history of medieval Europe in which the empire and the papacy played leading roles . The nations of today are obviously very complex phenomena . They did not emerge all of a sudden , but were formed through the centuries by the opera . tion of many forces , cultural , religious , and political . Long before Italy and Germany emerged as unified national states in the nine.t teenth century Italians and Germans had come to think of them . ' selves as belonging to nations which malignant forces had prevented from achieving political unity . The forging of the sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to nation being is a subtle process which frequently eludes the historian . " Sometimes that process accompanied political unification , some . times it preceded , sometimes followed . The French state is largely the creation of its kings . It is reasonable therefore to trace the growth of France through the history of the French monarchy for , to a considerable extent , they are one and the same history . THE EARLY FRENCH MONARCHY The last Carolingian ruler to unite the German and French halve* of Charlemagne 's empire was the incompetent Charles the Fat : who was deposed in 887 . The following year the West Frankish !  | bishops and nobles passed over the ten-year-old Carolingian heir nd elected as their king Odo , Count of Paris , who had successfully defended Paris against the attacks of the Norsemen . However , there were still many supporters of the Carolingian claims so that Ton the death of Odo in 898 , the Carolingians were restored to he French throne in the person of Charles the Simple . It was Charles the Simple , we recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Norsemen in the district which became known throughout . After French history as Normandy . However , in 997 a descendant of Odo , Hugh Capet , was elected king of " the Franks , Flemish , Bretons , Aquitanians , Burgundians , nd Gascons . " The Capetian dynasty thus established became one i i the principal factors in the rounding out of France . Of course I I ugh Capet was only one of a number of influential French nobles this day . He held the title of king but in fact his powers extended no further than the boundaries of his own fief . The achievements of the early Capetians may seem small , but they were important . Hugh , before his death in 996 , had his son rowned king . By so doing he obviated the calling of a council t ( i bestow the crown upon a successor and established the sucfcession in his own family . The early Capetians were fortunately Iutng-lived ; Robert ruled from 996 to 1031 , Henry I from 1031 to o6o , Philip I from Io6o to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uldition , the Capetians were favored by the clergy who supported 1 ntralized rule because it tended to reduce feudal anarchy and t ade the administration of the church easier than would have been the case in a France split up into many independent states . POLICIES OF THE FRENCH MONARCHY It would not be possible in a brief survey to trace the work of the French monarchs reign by reign . In any case their policy is , uimmed up in the achievements of pivotal figures . Louis VI ( 1108 , 1137 ) strengthened the position of the monarchy by overthrowing the minor nobles who were his vassals within the duchy of France , the limited Capetian realm lying between the Loire and the Somme rivers . This gave his successors full control of the resources of their own fief . Louis VII ( 1137 ? 1180 ) married Eleanor of Aquitaine , the greatest heiress of her day . This marriage might have advanced  | greatly the fortunes of the French monarchy had it been successful , for the dukes of Aquitaine ruled a territory equal to almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twice the site of the Capetian territories . But the marriage was not a happy one , and during fifteen years of married life Eleanor bore Louis two daughters but no son . During the course of the Second Crusade , the royal pair quarreled . In 1152 the marriage was annulled as a result of the " discovery " that Louis and Eleanor were more closely related than the church law allowed . To make matters worse , Eleanor then married the young duke of Normandy who was also count of Anjou and Maine . A year after the marriage this young man became king of England as Henry II , thus placing half of France under the rule of the English rather than the French king . To add insult to injury Eleanor bore Henry four sons . PHILIP AUGUSTUS But by a second marriage Louis had a son who became one of the greatest kings of France . This son was Philip II , better known as Philip Augustus ( 1180-1223 ) . Philip did much to make Paris the political and cultural center of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of the famous cathedral of Notre Dame , and in other ways beautified and improved the capital city . Philip acquired Artois by marriage , and Amiens and Vermandois as a result of disputes over rights to succession . He withdrew from the Third Crusade , as we saw , and during Richard 's absence in the East invaded Normandy . Upon his return from the crusade Richard succeeded in recapturing Normandy from Philip , but in 1199 Richard died and was succeeded by his brother John against whom Philip had better success . It will be remembered that as king of France Philip was the overlord of the great French nobles . Although John was king of England , he also ruled vast territories in France and as ruler of these French fiefs he was the vassal of Philip . In 1200 John injured one of his French vassals by marrying the vassal 's fiancee . John 's vassal , Hugh of Lusignan , appealed for justice to this lord 's overlord who was Philip of France . Under the feudal code John was entirely in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris for a hearing , John failed to appear and was acp 189 cordingly sentenced to the forfeiture of his French fief in I2o2 for Violation of his feudal obligations to his vassal . But the judgment of the court was of little significance until enforced . Philip began the conquest of Normandy . With the fall of the great fortress Chateau Gaillard , built by Richard , Normandy went over to Philip . The counties of Maine , Touraine , and Anjou quickly followed suit . And John , in trouble with his English vassals , was unable to launch an expedition against Philip in France . However , John joined a coalition of princes headed by the emperor Otto IV who invaded France from the east . Philip gathered together his noble and clerical vassals and in addition called upon the towns to aid him with their militia . At Bouvines in 1214 Philip won a great victory over his enemies . The effective support of the townsmen greatly increased the power of the king and by the victory of Bouvines Philip firmly established his hold over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France had become for the first time the strongest feudal noble in France . France was as divided culturally as it was politically . In the south there flourished a great civilization superior to that of northern France . The area had greatly prospered by the crusades . Its textile industries and sea-borne commerce brought wealth to the region ; md its cities.and court became centers of culture and learning . But the spread of the Albigensian heresy , which has been described elsewhere , was a matter of grave concern to the church and to many Catholic princes of Europe . In 1208 Pope Innocent III proclaimed a crusade against the Albigensians . Philip allowed his son to join in the crusade which was led by the Norman noble Simon de Montfort . This war between the North and South continued for many years . During its course the civilization of south France was destroyed . The struggle was continued under Louis VIII ( 1223 ? 1226 ) : ind under Louis IX ( 1226 ? r270 ) until I249 when the brother of Louis IX became count of Toulouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered territories may be compared with the influx of " carpetbaggers " into the Southern states after the American Civil War . After the death of Alphonse of Poitou during the reign of Philip III ( I270 ? 1285 ) Toulouse was added to the French royal domain . During Philip 's reign another large fief was added to the expanded domain of the Capetian rulers . In 1274 the Count of Champagne died leaving as his heir a girl of three .  | Philip added Champagne to the royal domain and to secure his claim betrothed the Champagne heiress to his son who became Philip IV . EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT The expansion of the territories ruled by the French kings made necessary the creation of an administration to carry on the government of the extended domain . Instead of restoring the feudal custom of investing portions of the kingdom in the hands of the feudal vassals , Philip II divided his realm into administrative districts which he placed in charge of salaried officials , called baillis , who were responsible to himself . These men administered justice , collected taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When this system of government was extended to the south of France the officials were called seneschals , but the functions of the office remained substantially the same . Other agents of the government traveled among the bailiwicks and checked the conduct of the local agents . The character of the Great Council of feudal times gradually became changed . Under Louis IX certain cases were required to be referred to the king 's council . The cases became so numerous that a number of the council were formed into a group of justices which became the high court , or parlement of France . Under Louis IX a permanent committee was also set up to deal with matters of finance . By such steps the feudal government of the council of nobles was gradually transformed into a royal council representing various departments of government functioning under the authority of the king . Louts IX Louis IX is known in French history as St. Louis . He was a wise and capable ruler and his reign was for the most part a happy one for France . The outstanding failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moslems . In I249 he led a crusade against Damietta in the Nile Delta . The city was captured but was later surrendered when the French army was defeated and Louis himself taken prisoner . In 1270 Louis once again organized a crusade . During the course of the attack against Tunis , Louis died  | of the plague and the expedition was abandoned . With these failures of St. Louis the crusades came to an end . Saxon and Norman England EARLIEST INHABITANTS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN off the European coast lie the British Isles , a group of about five hundred islands some of which are visible from the continental mainland . From earliest times successive waves of invaders have crossed over from the European continent and settled upon England 's eastern shores . As each new group pressed inland from the coast they drove the earlier inhabitants back into the highlands of Scotland and Wales or into remote corners of the island . We recall from the early chapters of our history how the Celts , who had begun to make their way westward across Europe as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy and France . Numbers of them crossed over into England and pushed back the earlier dark-skinned and dark-haired inhabitants . The two groups of Celts which settled in the British Isles , the Gaels and the Brythons , maintained contact with their fellows on the European mainland . As a result of this , when the Romans under Julius Caesar conquered Gaul the Brythons sent aid to their cousins the Belgae , and it was this fact which caused Caesar to cross over into Britain in 55 B.C. to punish the allies of the conquered Celts . But Caesar was recalled from Britain by more important matters , and it was not until the reign of the emperor Claudius that Britain was conquered and subjected to Roman rule ( 43 A.D. ) . The Romans subjugated England but never extended their conquests to Scotland Dr Wales . They built cities and defensive walls , and highways .  | During four centuries of Roman rule England was Romanized in the same manner as Gaul . But when the barbarians attacked the Roman Empire along its northern and eastern boundaries it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth century to defend the threatened frontiers . A large part of the Roman population also withdrew across the Channel leaving Britain to the mercies of the invading Angles , Saxons , and Jutes . ANGLO-SAXON ENGLAND After the withdrawal of the Roman armies the Picts and Scots attacked Romanized Britain . Soon Germanic Jutes , Angles , and Saxons raided , then settled upon , the coasts . These Teutonic tribes migrated to Britain in large numbers ; the entire Angle nation seems to have moved to Britain for no trace remains of it on the continent . The British population was annihilated or driven back into the mountains . In the course of the Anglo-Saxon conquest Roman civilization in Britain was entirely destroyed . The large numbers of words of Latin origin which have a place in later English speech are not survivals of the Roman occupa+ ' : on of Britain . Many such words became a part of the English language after the Norman Conquest in the eleventh century . Christians from Roman Britain , Wales and Scotland found their way into Ireland and converted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Patrick who became the patron saint of Ireland . Toward the end of the sixth century Christian missionaries from Ireland crossed over into England and began to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity . In 597 there arrived in Kent a group of missionaries sent out from Rome to bring Christianity to pagan England . St. Augustine and his missionaries were well received by King Ethelbert who gave them permission to preach freely and hold services . Ethelbert himself was converted . By the end of the seventh century nearly the whole of England was Christian once more . During the centuries when Christian Ireland had been cut off from contact with Rome , many practices had grown up in the Irish church which were different from those which prevailed on the continent . The Irish calendar placed Easter on a different date from the Roman . These differences gave rise to difficulties among p 193 the Anglo-Saxon Christians , some of whom had been converted by Irish and Scotch missionaries while others had been converted by Roman churchmen . In 664 King Oswy called a synod at Whitby in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king listened to the arguments on both sides and finally decided that the Roman bishops , as the descendants of St. Peter , should be obeyed in matters of doctrine and church practice . The decision was important for it preserved the unity of western Christendom and brought England into closer contact with the continent . Schools and churches were established throughout England . Scholars were trained in the liberal arts and many religious centers in England became famous for scholarship and learning . It will be recalled that when Charlemagne established his educational reforms , founded his palace school and many monastic schools throughout his empire , he brought over the great English scholar Alcuin of York and placed him in charge of this great work . One of the famous names associated with this Anglo-Saxon renaissance or rebirth of learning and culture was Bede , whose Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation has already been referred to . The rapid development of Anglo-Saxon civilization was arrested by the coming of the Norsemen . The first recorded attack of the Norsemen upon England occurred in 787 . The attacks continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During this time England north of the Thames was repeatedly ravaged by Norse attacks . By 885 the monastic schools in that area had ceased to exist . The kingdom of the West Saxons , Wessex , to the south was still unconquered by the Danes , as the Norse were called by the English , but its plight was serious . In 87o there came to the throne of Wessex the able king Alfred . For a time the young king was forced to remain hidden in the marshes for the Danes had overrun part of his kingdom . Alfred managed to gather about him a following and to inspire them with fresh courage . His army attacked the Danes and decisively defeated them . This victory was followed by the treaty of Wedmore in 885 by the terms of which Guthrum , the Danish leader , agreed to accept Christianity for himself and his people . Alfred surrendered half his kingdom to the Danes in order to hold the other half . For at least a century the Norsemen continued to migrate to England in large numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom  | from the Danes . He organized his subjects so that at all times one third of the able-bodied men were available for immediate military service . Alfred also built a fleet to protect his coasts . Alfred next devoted himself to improving the condition of his people . He studied Latin and translated into his own tongue the books which seemed to him most useful for his purpose . He re-established old laws , imported teachers and founded a school for the instruction of his nobles . His successors carried on his work . Adopting the Danish method of fighting , they succeeded in reconquering bit by bit the lands that had been surrendered to the Danes . But despite the strong leadership of Alfred and his immediate successors , the growth of feudalism in England weakened the Anglo-Saxon monarchy . The nobles increased their holdings until the great earls of Wessex , Mercia , East Anglia , and Northumberland were more powerful than the king himself . During the long reign of the weak king Ethelred " the Unready , " who came to the throne in 987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethelred resorted to the device of buying off the Danes , and a tax known as the Danegeld was levied upon his subjects for that purpose . In Io16 Sweyn Forkbeard and his son Cnut invaded England and Ethelred fled to the continent . Cnut succeeded his father . Although he had conquered England , he was in turn conquered by Christianity . He became a pious Christian and a good ruler . After his death England broke away from Scandinavia . Ethelred had married the Norman princess Emma , and upon the conquest of his kingdom by the Danes had fled to Normandy where his son Edward was raised . His widow Emma married the Dane Cnut , who had helped drive her first husband out of England , and thus Edward was in a position to claim the English throne either as the Anglo-Saxon heir of Ethelred or as the stepson of Cnut . He ascended the English throne in 1042 , and ruled until the Norman conquest in 1o66 . Edward " the Confessor , " as we have said , was raised in Normandy . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and officials . He appointed Normans to church offices and encouraged the migration into England of Norman traders . The Norman character of Edward 's reign provoked an Anglo-Saxon reaction against the Norman influence which was headed by Godwin . earl of Essex . Unon the death of Godwin , his p 195 , on Harold succeeded him as leader of the Anglo-Saxon group which dominated the feudal council , the Witan . THE NORMAN CONQUEST Edward , who died in 1o66 , left no direct heirs . As a result there followed a three-cornered contest for the throne of England . Harold Godwinson , who led the Anglo-Saxon faction , was elected king Icy the Witan although he was not of royal blood . Harold Hardrada , king of Norway , laid claim to the English throne as a descendant of Cnut . The third candidate was Duke William of Normandy , who claimed the English throne had been promised to him by his cousin Edward the Confessor and that Harold Godwinson had promised to support that claim .

Harold hurried southward with his army which was reduced in numbers and exhausted by the time it encountered William 's fresh Norman troops . At the battle of Hastings Harold lost both the battle and his life . NORMAN ENGLAND William overcame the English barons and established himself firmly upon the throne of England . He divided up the land retaining forty percent as his private estate . The lands given to his nobles were so divided up that no feudal baron was powerful enough to offer resistance to the crown . William also assumed control of the English church . No papal bulls or excommunications were to be published in England without the king 's consent . William favored the Cluniac reformation then in progress on the continent but insisted that in England it be conducted under the supervision of the crown .

He was defeated at the battle of Tinchebrai in I Io6 , and was kept a prisoner by his brother during the remaining nineteen years of his life . Henry I strengthened the royal government of England . He created a small council of advisers ; he created the office of chancellor to take charge of all records and correspondence of the government ; and he placed a treasurer in charge of government finance . He sent out justices who traveled throughout the realm settling cases locally , the modern circuit court .

Then in 1152 he married the great heiress , Eleanor of Aquitaine , whose marriage to King Louis VII of France had just been annulled , as we noted in a previous chapter . Master of half of France , Henry Plantagenet then compelled Stephen to recognize him as heir to the English throne . The following year Stephen died , and Henry Plantagenet became Henry II of England . Henry II ( 1154 ? 1189 ) revived the administrative reforms of Henry I and extended them . All crimes were placed under the jurisdiction of the royal courts and the grand jury was instituted by which criminals were indicted .

The later years of Henry II 's reign were made unhappy by the rebelliousness of his sons , Eleanor having borne him four . Two of those sons predeceased him .

During the eleven years of his reign he spent more than ten of them away from England engaged in wars in France , or in the East , or waiting to be ransomed from his imprisonment . He  | left no heirs and upon his death in 1i99 , the scepter passed to his brother John . Prince Arthur , the son of an older brother , had a strong claim to the English throne ; according to modern notions of succession , : I stronger one than John 's .

" The archbishop of Canterbury was the primate of England ; that is , he was head of the English church . The English kings had been in the habit of dictating the choice of the monks of Canterbury who elected the archbishop . Upon the death of Archbishop Hubert Walter in 1205 , the monks met secretly and elected one of their number , the sub-prior Reginald , and sent him off to Rome to be invested in his office by the pope before John could interfere . But Reginald indiscreetly let the news out as soon as he had crossed the Channel . When the tidings reached John he was furious .

Pope Innocent responded to this act of defiance by placing all England under an interdict . John then confiscated all church property , and declared that anyone who killed a priest was his friend . Most of the bishops left England . The pope then excommunicated John , declared him deposed from the throne of England , and called a crusade against him . John 's plight was desperate .

John tried to put them off , but at Runnymede he was compelled to sign the great charter , the famous Magna Carta which defined and guaranteed the rights of his subjects . Not only did this agreement secure the church from kingly intervention in church elections and protect the feudal 1 nobility against the impositions and illegal usages so freely practiced by John ; it also secured the free passage of merchants in and out of England and guaranteed that the peasants would not be subjected to arbitrary service and confiscations . John 's promise to respect the charter was worthless . He immediately resumed his war with the barons and met with considerable success , so much so that the barons called upon Louis of France , son of Philip Augustus , to be their king .

But when Henry assumed the direction of affairs , he appointed many Normans to important state and church offices . He married a Frenchwoman , Eleanor of Provence , most of whose relatives and friends came to England and obtained lucrative offices . The pope too flooded the English church with foreign appointees ? Gregory IX in 1242 insisted that English livings be provided for 390 Italian churchmen before any Englishmen were appointed . Rome imposed heavy taxes upon the English church for it needed funds to support the struggle with the Emperor Frederick II . Finally , the pope sought to obtain the support of English arms against Frederick by offering the crown of Sicily to the second son of Henry III on condition that the English drive out Frederick . The king accepted and appealed to the Great Council for the necessary funds and military support . The barons refused both .

The civil war which followed was brief . The king was defeated and taken prisoner . For a year Simon ruled England . During that time he called the first " parliament " which was composed of representatives of all classes of men . The great nobles and clerics were there .

During the remainder of Henry 's life , Prince Edward was the real ruler of England . As we have said Edward supported the revolution until he saw that under de Montfort 's leadership it would destroy the monarchy . He still believed however that the people of England ought to have the opportunity to approve the laws under which they were governed . In 1295 he called into being what has become known as the Model Parliament . It consisted of four houses : one contained the nobles , bishops and abbots of the old Great Council ; the representatives of the lower clergy formed a second house ; a third was made up of the representatives of the shires ; and a fourth of the representatives of the towns . This parliament was not to frame and pass laws ; that was still the prerogative of the king . But it did provide an opportunity for the nation 's representatives to make known their attitude toward a law before it was put into effect .  | Germany and Italy UPON THE DEATH OF CONRAD III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick , duke of Suabia , nephew of the deceased emperor . The new ruler , known in history as Frederick Barbarossa , like his predecessors , regarded himself as the secular head of western Christendom . Frederick wisely devoted his attention to strengthening his position in Germany before attempting to deal with the larger problem of the empire . He conciliated the rival German factions and bestowed many favors upon the powerful Henry the Lion , duke of Bavaria and Saxony , in order to secure his loyalty . Frederick crossed into Italy and at Pavia was crowned king of the Lombards . He then moved on to Rome and in 1 155 received the imperial crown from the hands of the pope . During his visit in Rome , Frederick was made to realize that the pope , Hadrian IV , considered the emperor inferior in authority to the pope . After he had left Rome , a message reached him from the pope in which reference was made to the many benefits ( beneficia ) bestowed upon the emperor by the papacy . However , the papal messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frederick was highly indignant for he had defended the pope against the king of Naples and Sicily , and had suppressed an anti-papal revolt of the Romans led by Arnold of Brescia . In 1158 Frederick sought to establish his control of northern Italy which he ruled as king . He insisted upon his right to collect taxes , to levy troops , to establish in each city an imperial governor or podesta . He forbade the formation of leagues among the cities , which would have forced the dissolution of the two rival leagues  | then headed respectively by Milan and Pavia . Milan promptly refused to accept these conditions and Frederick set about the subjugation of the rebellious city . The siege of Milan lasted three years . Meanwhile Pope Hadrian had died , and the college of cardinals elected as his successor Roland who became Alexander III . Frederick refused to recognize the new pope . He summoned a council at Pavia which deposed Alexander , and elected Victor IV whom Frederick approved . Alexander fled to France and opened negotiations with the Lombard cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and forced them to realize that the self-government they had enjoyed for so long was to be ended under the rule of Frederick . Under the leadership of the pope they formed a new league against Frederick . In 1174 Frederick returned to Lombardy and laid siege to the city of Alexandria , a newly built city that had been named in honor of the pope . The league gathered its forces and met the imperial army at Legnano in 1176 . The emperor was completely defeated . The following year the pope and emperor met at Venice where Frederick submitted and signed a truce which was followed in 1183 by the Peace of Constance . HOHENSTAUFEN SUCCESSES In Germany meanwhile , Henry the Lion had extended his power . He seized the Slav districts of Mecklenburg and Pomerania and sought to Germanize them by building cities and establishing bishoprics and monasteries . He encouraged industry and commerce . He took Lubeck in 1158 and proceeded to break the Danish monopoly of the Baltic trade . Frederick was suspicious of the success of his powerful vassal . Henry 's refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emperor 's defeat at Legnano . As a result , Frederick determined to break the power of his vassal . Frederick seized Henry 's duchies of Saxony and Bavaria and after reducing them in size bestowed them upon other vassals . His success in Germany restored much of the prestige the emperor had lost by his defeat in Italy . In 1186 Frederick arranged a marriage between his son Henry and Constance , the heiress of the Norman kingdom of Naples and  | Sicily which was a fief of the papacy . This was a shrewd coup which at once strengthened his hold upon Italy , and weakened the papacy 4 by bringing south Italy under Hohenstaufen control . The following year Frederick took the Crusaders ' Cross , and set out upon the Third Crusade . By so doing he hoped to supplant the popes as the leaders of western Christendom in these great enterprises involving all Europe . But as we saw , Frederick 's career was abruptly terminated when he was drowned while bathing in an eastern stream .

He allied himself with his brother-in-law , Richard the Lion Hearted of England , and with Tancred of Sicily who usurped the throne of southern Italy . But the young emperor was a man of energy and ability , and he was aided by fate . Richard the Lion Hearted , returning through Germany from his crusade against Saladin , fell into Henry 's hands and was held for a large ransom . Henry the Lion 's son fell in love with a Hohenstaufen princess , and when his father died in 1195 the German rebellion came to an end . Henry VI then crossed into Italy and by shrewdly taking advantage of the jealous rivalry of the north Italian cities he secured their support . He was crowned in Rome , and proceeded into southern Italy where he seized the Norman kingdom and punished its ruler by blinding and mutilation . At the height of his career Henry VI died suddenly in 1197 , leaving as his successor his threeyear-old son . The following year there came to the papal throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil war immediately broke out in Germany . The Hohenstaufens passed over the infant Frederick and acclaimed Henry 's brother Philip king . The Guelf faction elected Otto of Brunswick , son of Henry the Lion . Both sides appealed to the pope for support . Innocent issued a declaration of papal supremacy in which he asserted that the empire was dependent upon the papacy for its origin and authority , and that it was the right and duty of the popes to provide for the empire by bestowing authority upon the emperor . He pronounced in favor of Otto of Brunswick who took p 203 the title Otto IV . The Hohenstaufens insisted that it was the right of the German nobles to select the emperor and the struggle ontinued . The Hohenstaufens allied themselves with Philip Augustus of France , and Otto was supported by Philip 's enemy , Richard of England .

Sicily over which Frederick ruled was at the time perhaps the most prosperous and best organized state in Europe . Palermo was an advanced cultural center and Frederick acquired a fine cduca ? lion . As he grew to manhood the situation in Germany opened up ; In opportunity for him to regain the German inheritance of which lie had been deprived .

In the same year his successor , Honorius III , crowned Frederick II emperor on condition that the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily be held separate from Germany , and hat Frederick go on a crusade . Frederick was not a religious man . He put off the crusade . In other ways his conduct offended the pope , for while he made Palermo a great cultural and intellectual center , he manifested a keen interest in Moslem thought , maintaining a force of Saracen troops , and a harem . For his failure to undertake a crusade , he was excommunicated . In 1227 he set out on a crusade but returned after three days because of illness .

He then determined to discipline Pope Gregory IX , who had been outspoken in his criticism of Frederick 's behavior and morals . He aroused the Roman citizens to revolt against the pope with the result that Gregory 's successor , Innocent IV , fled to France from whence he excommunicated Frederick . In I250 Frederick II died . Sicilian , partly by blood and wholly by training and interest , he neglected Germany . As a result the history of Germany during and after Frederick 's reign is one of disintegration .

Russia and the East EASTERN EUROPE IN EARLY TIMES ' THE GREAT STRETCH OF CONTINENT between the Black Sea and the Gulf of Finland has had a history in large part independent of the developments in Western Europe . Through the ages there had passed across the steppes , forests , and swamps of Eastern Europe many different peoples . Early in our account we traced the advance  | of the Indo-Europeans from Central Asia across this region into southern and western Europe . Later the Germans traversed the region and settled north of the Black Sea during the second century . Still later the Huns swept in from Asia and set up an extended empire in the region under Attila . During Justinian 's reign in the sixth century , Slavic peoples , whose place of origin is unknown , pressed southward and into the Balkan provinces of the Byzantine empire . In the late seventh century a Ural-Altaic people akin to the Huns crossed from northcast to southwest and eventually settled in the Balkans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Slav neighbors , lost their racial identity and became predominantly Slavic . EXPANSION OF THE SLAVS AND THE COMING OF THE Rus During the seventh century the Slays , who had been located north of the Carpathians , began to expand . They eventually spread themselves over the whole region from the steppes north of the Black Sea to the Gulf of Finland . They traversed the heavily wooded region along the great rivers which remained the chief means of communication and trade for many centuries . About the middle of the ninth century , during the era of Norse expansion , some of the Scandinavian Vikings crossed the Baltic , entered the Gulf of Finland and the rivers of northern Russia , and made their way southward into the Ukraine around 859 . These Scandinavians who settled in Russia were known as Varangians ; as they were also called Rus ( meaning rowers ) , the land which came under their dominion ' was known as Russia . The Varangians ? like their Norse kinsmen , in the British Isles , in Northern France , in Iceland , Greenland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turov , Polotsk , and Kiev . Rurik , the Scandinavian chieftain , is supposed to have established himself in Novgorod in 862 . By the tenth century these Varangian principalities were loosely organized in a great state . This was the work of Rurik and his successors , Igor and Oleg . The people of the Varangian principalities were of course largely Slavic . KIEV AND NOVGOROD Kiev became the capital of the Varangian domain and the law of its Grand Prince was respected in all the provinces which paid  | annual tribute in furs , skins , grain , honey , wax , and slaves . These commodities were sent down the Don and Dnieper to the Black Sea and thence to Constantinople with which a lively commerce had developed . Byzantine culture and religion spread throughout Russia and became so firmly established that after the fall of Constantinople in the fifteenth century , the civilization of the Byzantine East survived in that region .

Yaroslav ( 1016 ? 1054 ) , son of Vladimir , defeated the Petchenegs , who were settled north of the Black Sea . He issued the first code of Russian law . But , like the feudal Franks , he divided up his great empire among his five sons and thus began the disintegration of the great Varangian state . Disintegration was hastened by the invasion of the steppes by an Asiatic horde called the Polovti who severed the trade routes between Russia and the Black Sea and who systematically raided Russian territory during a period of one hundred and fifty years . The Russians , pushed northward during the twelfth century , migrated into Poland and Lithuania . Others settled around Moscow . Novgorod became the chief center of the new North Russian state . The monarchy was abandoned and a republic was established in its place . Novgorod developed a prosperous commerce in the Baltic with the cities of the Hanseatic League . THE MONGOLS In the thirteenth century , the Mongol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great empire by Genghis Khan . Under the leadership of the great Genghis , the Mongols set out to conquer the world . They seized Turkestan from the kingdom of North China and then conquered the Turkish empire of Kharezm . They then swept westward and by 1223 had reached the Don . The sons and grandsons of Genghis ? among whom was the famous Kublai Khan in China ? continued the conquests . The Mongols invaded Russia and took Kiev in 1240 . They pursued the Kipchak Turks into Hungary and in 1241 their horsemen reached  | Italy and the Adriatic . The Europeans knew them as Tatars or Tartars . The Tartars overran Poland and their armies invaded the Moslem East and seized Baghdad , Aleppo , and Damascus . However , after 1243 , the Mongol horde slowly withdrew into Asia . But there remained in Russia the western Mongol Kingdom of the Golden Horde which survived there until the fifteenth century .

Upon his return he dictated The Book of Marco Polo which was translated into many languages and was widely known in Europe during the Middle Ages . TAMERLANE In 1369 Tamerlane succeeded the Emir of Khurasan . He imnediately set about to reconquer the lands that had earlier fallen into Mongol hands . This fierce and barbarous conqueror subjugated a vast territory stretching from Hindustan in northern India to Hungary . He seized Baghdad and Damascus from the Ottoman Turks . After receiving the homage of the Byzantine emperor in 1402 , " Tamerlane returned to his capital , Samarkand , north of the Caspian Sea .

Two of these Muscovite princes stand out above all others : Ivan the Great and Ivan the Terrible .

It was Ivan III who first assumed the title , Caesar or Czar . Ivan IV ( 1547-1584 ) , " The Terrible , " was an able ruler who extended Russian territory , introduced many reforms , and strengthened the monarchy . Yet he deserved his title " The Terrible , " for his terrible passion combined with a strange cowardice and an utter disregard for human life led him to commit deeds which shocked even the barbarous age in which he lived .

Rivalry of England and France WHILE popes and emperors struggled for predominance in Italy -a struggle which , as we have seen , led to the eventual disintegration of Germany ? the kings of England and France steadily enlarged their powers and in so doing prepared the way for the final emergence of two great nation-states of Europe . For a long time however the end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recalled that the Angevin empire of King Henry II of England included England , half of France , with Wales , Scotland , Ireland , and Brittany as vassal states . The fact that the English kings claimed overlordship of a large part of France determined the major policy of the French kings . ' The French monarchy , it was recognized , would never be secure so long as English kings claimed part of France . On the other hand , the English rulers in their turn felt that so long as the French monarchy remained powerful their claims to French fiefs would always be disputed . The fundamental issue of the Hundred Years ' War was whether France would survive as an independent national state ruled by French kings , or whether it would become part of an Anglo-French empire under English kings . There were many lesser issues which furnished occasion for the launching of the long struggle . As we saw earlier , the herring had shifted their breeding grounds from the Baltic to the North Sea . French and English fishing fleets met at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This led to an exchange of raids upon Eng . fish and French coasts and shipping . Another cause of war was the situation in Flanders . Flanders was a center of cloth manufacture and depended upon England for its chief raw material , wool . The Flemish cities had long enjoyed a large degree of municipal independence and jealously resisted any attempt on the part of the count of Flanders to restrict them in any way , or to share in the profits of their enterprise through increased taxation . In the course of this quarrel between the Flemings and their lord , the count was driven out of Flanders in the early fourteenth century , but was restored to his county through the help of his overlord , the French king , in 1328 . The English had not hesitated to make trouble for the French king by encouraging the Flemish revolt . As a result the Flemish count ordered the arrest 9f all English merchants in Flanders .

It should also be mentioned that Bordeaux , in English hands , was the outlet for the sea-borne trade of southwestern France . The French kings were naturally desirous of controlling this seaport and its trade , and that ambition furnished another motive for the war . In 1340 Philip VI of France determined to avenge the attacks upon French fishermen and to break the English commercial hold in Flanders . He gathered a fleet of Norman and Breton ships and hired forty galleys from Genoa . These he assembled at Sluys in preparation for his attack . Meanwhile Edward had not been idle . With a fleet of English and Flemish ships he appeared outside the harbor of Sluys , and the French issued forth to meet him . The English destroyed or scattered the French fleet , and established a supremacy upon the sea which they maintained throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicament . They had driven out their count . The count and his overlord , the king of France , both appealed to the pope to condemn and punish the rebellious Flemings for their violation of their feudal obligations to their overlord . Dreading the papal weapons of excommunication and interdict . JItcob van Artevelde hit upon  | n scheme which would temporarily tie the hands of the papacy . ' his involved the question of the French royal succession . The last four Capetian kings prior to 1328 had many daughters but no sons . Upon the death of Charles IV in 1328 , it became necessary to determine who was next in line in the succession . Ii the succession were permitted to pass to a grandson through his mother , Edward III might claim the crown of France for his mother was a French princess . But the French Estates General ruled out that possibility and bestowed the crown upon a cousin of Charles IV who became Philip VI ( 1326-1350 ) . At the time Edward III accepted the decision of the Estates General and acknowledged Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiefs . Jacob van Artevelde proposed that Edward of England assume the title , " King of France . " This would make it necessary to investigate and establish all claims before the papacy would be in a position to take action against the Flemings for disobedience to their overlord . The English king gathered an army which was made up of all classes of Englishmen . The most formidable weapon of the English , as it proved , was the long bow . This bow could be discharged with great rapidity and force , and its steel-tipped arrows were capable of piercing armor at a distance of one hundred yards . Its maximum range was nearly six hundred yards . Years of practice were necessary in order for a man to develop the muscles necessary to draw this powerful bow , so that it was impossible for an army unaccustomed to its use to adopt the weapon quickly . In 1346 Edward set out from England with an army intending to land at Bordeaux and invade France from the south . Winds held his fleet in the channel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Normandy he marched inland south of the Seine . Along the way he devastated the countryside , burned fields and 1 Buildings , and collected an enormous booty . The French hurried up to check his advance . As the French arrived , Edward forded the Seine , intending to join the reinforcements that had been dispatched from Flanders . However , the French army was at his heels , and he was forced to halt and do battle . The battle site of Crecy was carefully chosen . The English army was disposed upon a slight rise of ground that was protected from  | flank attack by wooded and marshy lands . At the top of the rise the English knights dismounted and prepared to meet the French charge on foot . To the right and left were companies of bowmen , and hidden in the bushes at the extreme ends were bodies of Welsh knifemen . The French advanced in customary formation . They were preceded by the Genoese crossbowmen who fired a volley of bolts toward the English ranks with the purpose of breaking up their formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their volley fell short for a brief shower had wetted and loosened the strings of the crossbows . In their impatience to get at the unmounted English knights the French cavalry charged before the confused crossbowmen had opened their ranks to permit passage of the horsemen . Some confusion resulted . The English bowmen had protected the strings of their bows against the rain . As the French cavalry charged , slowed down by the rise in the ground and the masses of crossbowmen , the English archers discharged their arrows at long range into the close ranks of the French cavalry . Horses and men went down in great numbers and soon the field was a confused mass of entangled animals and men . When the arrows had done their work , the knifemen closed in and dispatched the knights as they lay struggling on the ground . It is estimated that the French lost between 15,000 and 20,000 killed . The English lost fewer than fifty . Free from any danger of French attack , Edward next laid siege to the port of Calais which he took and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern France . THE BLACK DEATH After the capt , re of Calais both nations were so exhausted by the war that the pope 's emissaries were able to negotiate a truce . Then in 1347 Europe suffered another disaster . This was the great plague known as the Black Death . The bubonic plague was carried on the bodies of rats which infested the ships trading with the Orient . It is estimated that this dread disease carried off from onequarter to one half of the population as it swept back and forth across Europe between 1347 and 1350 . Sometimes the entire crew of a ship would die at sea and the shin would drift until driven up on shore where it would at once p 213 become a new focal point of infection . The suffering and repulsive appearance of the victims can scarcely be described , and the demoralization it produced among the people can scarcely be imagined .

Edward , heir to the English throne , who is known in history as the Black Prince , decided to resume the war on France . He marched northward into France , plundering and ravaging the countryside as he went . Suddenly he found himself confronted by a French army ten times the size of his own . It was led by King John , who had come to the throne in 1350 , and his three sons . The Black Prince offered to make terms with his formidable enemy , for defeat seemed certain , but confident of victory the French king declined the offer . The battle of Poitiers in 1356 was a repetition of the victory at Crecy . King John and his three sons were taken prisoner and carried off to England with many French nobles to be held for ransom . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no value as hostages and their numbers endangered their captors . This first phase of the Hundred Years ' War was brought to a conclusion by the Peace of Bretigny in 136o , which added Poitou to the English possessions in southern France , and confirmed the English possession of Calais and the surrounding county of Ponthieu . The English king was to hold his possessions henceforth in free sovereignty and no longer as vassal of the French monarch . CIVIL STRIFE IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND With the cessation of hostilities , thousands of soldiers of both armies found themselves in France without employment . They formed themselves into bands called " free companies " which ravaged the countryside and looted towns and villages . Meanwhile  | the French were called upon to raise enormous sums of money to ransom their king and his nobles . This was the condition which met Charles , son of King John , who returned to France to establish order and to arrange for the payment of his father 's ransom .

In Paris Stephen Marcel was elected provost of the mer chants of Paris in 1355 . After the disaster of Poitiers in .1356 , Marcel saw an opportunity to impose such terms upon the king as would give the burghers a predominance in the French government . Marcel aroused the Paris mob and invaded the palace in order to intimidate the Dauphin Charles . Charles fled from Paris and appealed to the nobles of the country for support . The desperate peasantry , encouraged by the actions of Marcel and the Estates General , broke into revolt and this convinced the nobles of the necessity of supporting the king and restoring law and order . The revolts were put down , and Marcel was assassinated in Paris . The Dauphin , who became King Charles V in 1364 , was fortunate in having the services of an able military commander , Bertrand du Guesclin , who recruited an army from among the free companies and restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gascony so irked the Gascon nobles that they appealed to Charles V to secure them justice , and the war was resumed . Du Guesclin wisely avoided a pitched battle with the English . He drew the hostilities away from France by an expedition across the Pyrenees and harried the English by guerilla tactics . In 1376 the Black Prince died of camp fever . By this time English holdings in southern France had been reduced to the coastal region around Bordeaux and Bayonne . Edward III , who died in 1377 , was succeeded by his grandson , Richard II , who arranged the long truce of 1389 . England too had suffered a series of revolts . The Black Death had carried off so many of the peasantry that there was a scarcity of labor . The nobles sought to hold the peasants to their feudal condition while their labor was much in demand in the towns and on other estates .

RENEWAL OF THE WAR In 138o there came to the throne of France Charles VI ( 138o1422 ) , an eleven-year-old boy . In 1392 the young king went mad . He could not be deposed however because his insanity was recurrent , interrupted by periods of sanity . In this situation there developed a contest among the great princes of the realm for control of the government . The Duke of Burgundy , the king 's uncle , led one faction . He was opposed by the Duke of Orleans . A bitter civil war was fought between the two factions . In 1407 the Duke of Orleans was murdered in Paris and the leadership of his faction was taken over by the count of Armagnac . The war raged over possession of the capital city , Paris . Henry V of England aided both sides in order to keep the war going and weaken France .

He invaded France with about fifteen thousand men and besieged Harfleur . As he marched toward Calais after taking Harfleur he was met by a strong French army . The experience of Crecy and Poitiers was repeated once again at Agincourt , and at least ten thousand of the Armagnacs were slain . The Duke of Burgundy was then able to expel the Armagnacs from Paris . While the French factions continued their struggles with each other , Henry of England systematically reduced and occupied Normandy . In 1420 the Treaty of Troyes was signed which gave the English king a predominant role in France . Under the treaty Henry was to marry Catherine and become regent of France . The Dauphin was excluded from the succession . As regent , Henry proceeded to bring under- his control those regions of France that were in Armagnac hands . He cleared his enemies from the north of France , but before he could advance into the south both Henry V of England and Charles VI of France died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son was proclaimed king of England and France  | while the new king 's uncle , the duke of Bedford , became regent of both countries .

But English successes were such that the Burgundians now began to fear the consequences of English control of France . In 1435 Bedford died and Charles VII was able to win the Burgundian duke away from his English alliance . JOAN OF ARC Although the Burgundians no longer supported the English , the plight of Charles VII was desperate . The English held all the west and north of France , including the capital , Paris .

Charles was able to do no more for Joan than to provide her with a suit of armor and a small escort . But as the Maid advanced to the relief of besieged Orleans numbers of soldiers , stirred by the accounts they had heard of the strange Maid , joined the march . Within a few days of Joan 's arrival the siege of Orleans , which had lasted nineteen months , was raised . The French once again took heart . In fulfillment of the instructions of the " voices " which had guided Joan , she conducted the king to Rheims where he was crowned with ceremony in the great Cathedral as had been his ancestors before him .

However , Joan 's military successes were at an end . She was captured by the Burgundians and sold to the English . The French p 217 looked upon Joan as a saint and a deliverer . In order to destroy her influence the English had her tried as a witch and heretic . She was condemned and burned at the stake at Rouen in 1431 . But through her martyrdom Joan became a national heroine . The new national enthusiasm enabled Charles to drive the English first out of the north of France and then from the south . In 1453 the English retained of all their French possessions only Calais . The Avignon Papacy and the Great Schism Louis Ix , " Saint Louis , " was succeeded upon the French throne by Philip IV , called the Fair . Philip addressed himself energetically to the task of broadening the monarchical power . He reorganized administration , increased the number and powers of his officials , and regularized government functions , demanding periodic reports . A privy council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's cabinet . In order to render himself independent of the military support of the feudal nobility , Philip created a national army recruited from all classes of the population and paid out of the national treasury . In order to finance all these new governmental functions , he instituted a system of national taxation . This was naturally resisted because under the feudal system the king , like his vassals , was maintained by the revenues from his own private domain . These feudal revenues were naturally insufficient to support a modern national government . Throughout his reign Philip was plagued by money troubles . He resorted to many devices to fill the treasury . He banished the Jews from France , and confiscated their property . He then permitted them to return and take up their banking activities upon  | the payment of heavy fines . He reduced the value of money by decreasing the amount of precious metal in the coin and was thereby enabled to spend the balance .

He suddenly arrested all the Templars in France , brought charges against them of heresy and immorality , burned many of their leaders at the stake , and confiscated their property . It had become customary for the kings of both France and England to call upon the clergy for gifts to the royal treasury . These gifts had always been given voluntarily . Both Philip IV of France and Edward I of England , who were at war over Guienne , imposed taxes upon the Catholic clergy . The clergy of both countries appealed to the pope . Pope Boniface VIII in 1296 issued the bull Clericis Laicos in which he declared that no layman had the right to tax the clergy or church property . Edward responded by outlawing the English clergy with the result that when the protection of the law was removed the English clergy voted the sung their king had demanded . Philip cut off the export of papal revenues to Rome . He arrested a papal legate and tried him for treason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex- ' communicated Philip . Philip called together an Estates General in 1302 in which were represented along with the clergy and nobility , the Third Estate with elected representatives from the towns and countryside . Despite the fact that he was successful in persuading the Estates General to give him its support , Philip sent agents to Italy to bring the pope to France . The elderly Boniface received tough treatment at the hands of Philip 's agents and died . THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY OF THE PAPACY The archbishop of Bordeaux was elected to succeed Boniface as Clement V. Instead of going to Rome , Clement summoned the cardinals to Lyons where he was crowned pope in 1305 . It is true that the quarreling Roman factions threatened the safety of the pope , and Clement remained in France in an effort to save for the church some of the property of the Knights Templars which was  | dissolved by Philip as we saw . After a number of years in France , Clement in 1309 transferred the papal government to Avignon . Clement had not intended to establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years passed , he chose new cardinals from among the French clergy so that upon his death the Italians in the College of Cardinals were a minority . From 1305 to 1378 the papacy remained in France , French popes being elected by French cardinals . This is the famous " Babylonian Captivity " of the papacy . EUROPEAN REACTION TO THE AVIGNON PAPACY It was natural that during the course of the Hundred Years ' War the English should object to sending revenues of the English church to the French popes at Avignon to be spent in the enemy 's country . Whether rightly or wrongly the feeling grew among the faithful throughout Europe that the popes were subject to the influence of the French crown , with the result that papal revenues declined rapidly . In this situation the popes were forced to rely on the French to pay the costs of the papal government and many devices were elaborated to bring fees into church coffers . In time the French came to resent papal taxation to such an extent that by the end of the Babylonian Captivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the absence of the papacy the city of Rome declined . Embassies were sent to Pope Urban V urging the return of the pope to the Eternal City . Urban did pay a visit to Rome to prepare the way for the transfer of the papal government to that city . While in Rome he died . The Romans were now fearful that the election of another French pope might mean the continuance of the papal residence at Avignon . The threat of the Roman mob and a division among the French cardinals resulted in the election of the Italian archbishop of Bari as Urban VI in 1378 . THE GREAT SCHISM Urban VI at once vigorously and without tact condemned the morals and manners of the cardinals . His harshness antagonized the cardinals who met in council and , declaring that the election  | of Urban was invalid because brought about by the compulsion of the Romans , proceeded to elect as pope Robert of Geneva who took the name of Clement VII . Urban refused to recognize Clement , who took up his residence at Avignon . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Scotland , and Naples supported Clement . England , the Empire , northern Italy , Hungary and Poland gave their allegiance to the Roman pope Urban . The faithful throughout Europe were troubled . What if the individual unknowingly depended upon the services of the clergy supporting the wrong pope ? did this mean that the sacraments so administered were invalid and that his soul would be eternally damned ? Men began to ask themselves whether the authority of the papacy was in fact all that had been claimed . The spectacle of two popes making the same claims to that authority provoked doubts . In I409 a council of cardinals met at Pisa to deal with the schism . The council declared both the Roman and Avignon popes deposed and elected in their place Alexander V. But neither of the other popes paid any attention to the action of the council of Pisa , with the result that the situation was only further cornplicated with three popes instead of two . THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE Since the churchmen had failed to heal the schism , the emperor Sigismund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Tyrol in 1414 . Representatives attended from nearly every country in Europe . At the council of Constance all classes and interests were represented . It was attended by cardinals , bishops , abbots , priests , monks , kings , princes , burghers , peasants , and representatives of the universities and guilds . The program of the council of Constance was three-fold . It was to deal first with the papal schism . Next came the problem of heresy for during the Babylonian Captivity and Great Schism there arose many preachers who denied doctrines of the church which had been accepted for centuries , and these issues required to be clarified . And finally the council was to address itself to the question of reform within the church . The council deposed the three papal claimants and elected unanimously Odo Colonna who then became Pope Martin V. At p 221 the council were the two Bohemian heretics , John Hus and Jerome of Prague . They were heard by the council and their views declared heretical . When they refused to alter their position , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each nation were then asked to draw up a list of abuses which needed reform and submit them to the council . During the schism many intellectuals , chief among them John Gerson of the University of Paris , had denied the supremacy of papal authority . They held that superior to the pope in authority was the council representing all the faithful . This question was debated and although no final position was reached , the conciliar idea was sufficiently strong so that arrangements were made for the calling of church councils at regular intervals . In line with this policy a council was called at Pavia in 1423 , and in 1431 another council gathered at Basel . But wars and other preoccupations cut down the attendance at these and later councils so that in the long run papal authority was never seriously threatened and the conciliar movement died out .  | Middle Ages had known that the earth was spherical .

Columbus returned to Spain believing the islands he had discovered were in the neighborhood of the Asiastic mainland . Although Columbus made three more trips to the " Indies " before his death it is probable that he never realized he had not reached the East . The Spanish monarchs appealed to the pope to confirm their title to the lands discovered by Columbus in order that there might not develop a conflict with Portugal over conflicting claims .

He rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached India in the following year . Despite losses of men and half his ships he returned to Portugal in 1499 with a cargo which paid six thousand percent on the cost of the expedition . Da Gama 's expedition was a tremendous incentive to further Portuguese activities . In 1500 Cabral set sail and circling wide around Africa touched the coast of Brazil . There is now reason to believe that this was not an accident , and that the Portuguese already knew of the existence of land in that vicinity . Many Portuguese expeditions were sent to the East . The Portuguese established themselves along the coasts of India and Persia and in the Sijice Islands of the East Indies .  | THE SPANISH IN AMERICA Meanwhile the Spaniards continued their exploration and settlement of the New World .

Montezuma , ruler of the Aztecs , was rightly fearful of what might happen if the Spaniards reached his capital , Mexico City .

At last in 1522 a single surviving ship of the original five reached Seville , having completed the first circumnavigation of the globe . Meanwhile , in Mexico the Spanish learned of a great civilization which lay south of the Isthmus in South America . In 1524 Pizarro began a search for this fabulous El Dorado , the land of gold . After three years he reached Peru and the great Inca empire which flourished there . Although his force contained less than two hundred men and about fifty horses , nevertheless , Pizarro was successful in subjugating a vast empire which extended more than two thousand miles from north to south . Let us recall in connection with these almost unbelievable exploits of Spanish captains that horses , firearms , armor , and sailing ships were new to the Indians . In addition their civilization was not warlike . Even so , the achievements of the Spanish conquerors stagger the imagination .

But they saw that the climate was suitable to the raising of such products . They therefore established permanent settlements , opened up plantations , experimented with a variety of products . Missionaries preached Christianity to the natives , founded universities , and in other ways developed the country , and established European civilization there . But the discovery of the great stores of gold and silver in Mexico and Peru , which attracted many adventurers to those regions , has rather obscured the colonizing work of the Spaniards . The chief difference between the Portuguese and Spanish colonial empires was that the Portuguese empire was a commercial one ; its object was to trade with the populous and civilized lands of Asia and the East . The Spanish empire was a colonial empire . Its success is attested by the fact that with the principal exception of Brazil , which was Portuguese , the vast lands south of the United States are to this day predominantly Spanish in culture and speech . The Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE AGES Italy has been a land of city-states . The city-state , which was the predominant cultural and political unit of ancient Greek and Roman times remained a fundamental element even during the centuries of the Roman empire . For several , ' nturies a pattern of imperial law and administration was superimposed upon the city-state life , but when the imperial government collapsed in the fifth century the cities and towns survived , and their municipal life continued through the Middle Ages . THE STATES OF ITALY The long struggle between the emperors and popes had prevented in both Italy and Germany the sort of national centralization which took place in France and England and Spain . With the decline of the power of both empire and papacy during the fourteenth century , tl , e independence of the Italian city-states became firmly established . The old Norman kingdom of Naples and Sicily in the south was , of curse , an exception . But Rome , and Florence , and Genoa , and Milan , and Venice and other towns of lesser prominence , with the ountryside surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of central Italy were ruled by the church . Slightly to the north of the Papal States was the republic of Florence Bich controlled the greater part of Tuscany . In 1434 Cosimo , head I the powerful banking family of Medici , managed to become ruler of Florence . His family remained in control of the city for nearly two hundred years . Still further to the north in the valley of the Po  | was the duchy of Milan ruled by the Visconti family . In 1447 the Visconti line died out . An effort to establish a republic failed , and the military captain Francesco Sforza made himself duke of Milan . In the northeast Venice was ruled by a commercial oligarchy which selected a doge or leader from among the great families . The powers of the doge were much restricted by the Great Council which was the real government of Venice . The mutual jealousies of the Italian cities resulted in almost con ? stant warfare which was generally waged by hired bands of mercenary soldiers led by captains , called condottieri . This system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens free to go about their business , and as the object of the condottieri was to achieve results with as little sacrifice in men as possible , the prosperity of Italy was little impaired by the rivalry of her despotic rulers . THE RENAISSANCE The word Renaissance has many meanings . Literally it means a rebirth . Actually the movement marks a great change in the life and thinking of Europe , so marked in character that it is convenient and reasonable to consider that with the Renaissance the medieval period of European history came to an end . A modern historian has described one aspect of the Renaissance as an intensification of the secular spirit . For somehow or other , without denying the Christian teachings of the Middle Ages , men came to be less concerned with religion and their relationship to God and the future life and more interested in the good things of the world . This was partly the result of the tremendous loss in prestige suffered by the church during the Babylonian Captivity and Great Schism . Doubts had been sown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance of the conciliar idea which tended to undermine papal authority even though the conciliar movement failed . Much of the vigor and enthusiasm of the Renaissance comes from the fresh realization that the world is full of interest and beauty , and many things good in themselves which could be experienced and enjoyed without reference to any larger purpose or foreboding destiny . Let it be remembered that this mood and curiosity were constantly stimulated by increasing contact with they  | greater world that had begun during the period of the crusades and continued through the era of exploration and discovery . THE COLLAPSE OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE We have already referred to the conquests of the Ottoman Turk , , in Syria and Egypt and their effect upon European trade with the last . The Turks extended their conquest to Greece and the Balkan peninsula and finally , in 1453 , after long resistance , Constantinople , the capital of the eastern Roman empire , fell to them .

HUMANISM The study of the humane or refining and exalting literature of the ancients marks a trend known as Humanism . It stimulated a broad interest in the culture of the ancients which had its influence upon the development of the fine arts as well as upon literature . The sculpture and architecture of the ancient Greeks and Romans , very many examples of which had survived from ancient times , were imitated as carefully by artists as were their literary productions by the Renaissance men of letters . The wealthy churchmen and princes of Italy assembled libraries I ancient literature , and gave employment to scholars . They employed artists to decorate churches and palaces . The Gothic art of northern Europe , which had never been firmly established in Italy , e as abandoned and a new style was employed in the design of ! lurches , public buildings , and monuments . Art and scholarship flourished under generous patronage . Painting followed a more independent line of development for there were few surviving examples of the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result the art of the Renaissance was a completely new achievement , a thoroughly European and modern product . Artists continued to focus their attention upon religious nhjects . The Virgin Mary , holding the infant Jesus , was portrayed over and over again . Yet it is apparent that the Renaissance artists were less concerned to convey the spirituality and divinity of the  | subject than they were to represent naturally and appealingly a young mother and her chubby infant . Beginning with Giotto ( 1276-1336 ) the work of the great Italian painters rapidly became more natural and realistic . In the late fifteenth century Italy produced some of the greatest artists of all time . The names of Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1519 ) , Michelangelo ( 1475 ? 1564 ) , Raphael ( 1483 ? 1520 ) , top a long list of artists only less great . And in the following century Titian ( 1477-1576 ) , outstanding among a group of lesser men , carried on the tradition . In sculpture Ghiberti ( 1378 ? 1455 ) and Donatello ( 1386 ? 1466 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Renaissance artists is another characteristic which rather overwhelms us today . Cellini ( 1500 ? 1571 ) , the goldsmith whose exquisite work has delighted his own and later centuries , cast in bronze his arresting statue of Perseus and the slain Medusa . Michelangelo whose Last Judgment adorns the Sistine Chapel , was also supreme as a sculptor . His statues of David and Moses are famed throughout the world . He was also an engineer and a musician . Perhaps the greatest and most versatile of these extraordinary men of the Italian Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci . Most famous of his surviving paintings are the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper . But he was also a great sculptor , musician , poet , engineers scientist , inventor , and philosopher . His dissection of human bodiel and his anatomical drawings revolutionized the technique of anatomical representation . Among a long list of his inventions are a breech-loading cannon , a submarine , an air-cooling system , canal locks , aerial bombs , a parachute , and a variety of water-driven machines such as pumps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign , failed because of the lack of adequate motive power . The art , literature , and outlook of thy Renaissance spread throughout Europe . p 235 The Reformation j . TIKE OTHER IMPORTANT EVENTS of history the Reformation had Its roots deep in the past . We have already noted some of the effects of the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy upon the faithful throughout Europe . The English people , at war with France , were cit willing that the revenues of the English church should be sent n a French papacy resident in France , for inevitably that money , spent in France , would contribute to the prosperity of enemy Frenchmen . But it was a serious matter to refuse to the popes the venues to which their right had so long been established . The growing discontent with the situation in the church was intensified by the fact that the papal government was unable to mainLin its jurisdiction over the church organization outside of France . Worldly-minded prelates neglected their duties and church discipline became lax . The conduct of bishops and priests and monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy provided a further basis for dissatisfaction with the church as an institution . This was naturally true in other places than in England . JOHN WYCLIF Let us remind ourselves that the medieval Christian church was regarded as an indispensable institution founded by Jesus to guide tin faithful in matters of belief and ? through the administration of thy ? seven sacraments , the means of grace ? to save souls from eternal damnation . The sacraments were the indispensable means of salvation , and were exclusively administered by the clergy . When , in the  | twelfth and thirteenth centuries , the Waldensians and Albigensians attacked the behavior of corrupt members of the clergy , they were forced by logical necessity to deny the church 's exclusive control of the means of salvation before they could cast off their dependence upon a corrupt priesthood . Many later reformers were prompted by the same logic to tho same conclusions . During the Hundred Years ' War John Wyclif ( 1320-1384 ) , an Oxford scholar and English patriot , denounced the evils in the church . He insisted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English were not o liged to pay taxes to the papacy . He declared that the individual waa dependent upon no priestly hierarchy for salvation , but directly upon God . This led him to the conclusion that the Bible was the true and only essential guide to faith . In accordance with these beliefs he translated the Bible into English so that it might be read by the people . He organized preachers , known as the Lollards , to preach . to the poorer classes . He denied many Catholic doctrines , includi that of transubstantiation which is the belief that in the sacramen of the Eucharist , the bread and wine are actually transformed in the substance of the body and blood of Jesus . JOHN BUS In Bohemia a similar religious-patriotic reaction occurred . Bus had studied the writings of Wyclif and adopted most of his religious views . In Hus 's day the Czechs developed a strong national self . consciousness . They resented German domination and inevitabli that resentment was turned against the German prince-bishops who ) ruled extensive estates under the empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avignon and Rome appeared O foreign institution . Hus favored the formation of a Czech national church independent of Rome . When indulgences were issued in Bohemia iq order to raise money for a crusade against Naples , some of the artisans of Prague cried out that the indulgences were a lie . They were condemned and executed . Hus was excommunicated and Prague was placed under an interdict . Hus was forced by the king to withdraw from the university , and he remained in retirement until the calling of the Council of Constance two years later in 1414. p 237 As we have already recalled , Hus and his fellow heretic , Jerome of ague , traveled to Constance to argue their case before the council . They were condemned and burned at the stake . The execution of Hus and Jerome provoked a rebellion in BoheiL ' . Four hundred fifty-two ' Czech nobles signed a petition protesttit ; the action of the Council , and banded themselves together for ititual defense . The Bohemian ranks were soon divided by disputes ? ver religious doctrine and a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called upon to intervene . For eleven years the Bohemian war continued , from 1420 to 1431 . Ablest of the radical ohemian leaders was the John Ziska whose iron-clad wagons , in Iii role of modern tanks , wrought havoc among the German soliiry . Worn out by the long war the more moderate Bohemian factioons finally arranged a compromise settlement . During the remainder of the fifteenth century the Germanies remained politically disunited and weak . But trade prospered , partit ularly in western Germany along the Rhine . During this century tIi famous Augsburg banking family of Fugger extended its operations to the lowlands , the Tyrol and into Italy . THE ABUSE OF INDULGENCES In 1513 there came to the papal throne a member of the famous Medici family of Florence who took the name of Leo X. Leo was ti humanist , a student of ancient Latin literature , and a patron of Renaissance art and letters . The building of the great Church of St. Peter in Rome , designed by Bramante and Michelangelo , was a toject he advanced with enthusiasm . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faithful who contributed to the building of St. Peter 's would be freed from the penalties merited for their sins ? on condition , of course , that they obtained pardon in the usual way through the sacrament of penance . The archbishop of Mainz , Albert , who was a member of the Ilohenzollern family , saw in this indulgence campaign , an opportunity to resolve his financial difficulties . Somewhat earlier Albert had come to the Fugger bankers with an interesting proposition . ' There were only seven electors of the Holy Roman Empire of which The archbishop of Mainz was one . The emperor Maximilian was old and there were several powerful princes who coveted the title of emperor . Albert reasoned that in the circumstances lavish bribes  | would be offered the electors , and with this in mind he sought to obtain the appointment to the vacant archbishopric . Albert already held two church benefices . But he argued that the pope was in need of funds for the building of St. Peter 's Cathedral and that if he could anticipate with a cash payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were customarily paid to Rome , he would have no difficulty obtaining the appointment . He asked Fugger to advance him the necessary monies . The appointment was made according to plan . But the health of the emperor was better than Albert had judged , and the revenues of his new benefice less . The interest on his debt to Fugger accumulated faster than Albert could pay it off . He accordingly approached Fugger once more and proposed a similar advance to Rome out of the anticipated returns of the indulgence campaign on condition that Albert be put in charge of it . He hoped to pay his debts out of the indulgence campaign . This , too , worked out according to Albert 's designs . Albert then employed an enthusiastic and irresponsible preacher , John Tetzel , to travel about Germany and persuade the faithful to give generously to the indulgence fund . Tetzel seems to have been carried away by the success of his own oratory . He began to claim that to those who bought indulgences pardon was unnecessary , and that it was even possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such claims shocked many of the more intelligent Germans. , Luther protested to the elector , Frederick of Saxony , and to his churchly superior in Germany who was , of course , Albert himself . When the faithful came to confession he refused to recognize Tetzel 's indulgences and this naturally caused an uproar . MARTIN LUTHER Martin Luther was the son of a prosperous peasant and had been trained for a career in the law . Much to the disgust of his father , he gave up his legal studies and entered the Augustinian monastery at Erfurt . He was transferred to Wittenberg where he became a teacher in the university . Luther was a loyal Catholic , and when he first attacked Tetzel 's conduct of the indulgence campaign he had no thought of separating himself from the church . In accordance with the custom of the time , Luther posted upon the door of Castle church at Wittenberg a list of ninety-five theses  | In order to offset the influence of the Protestant League , the German Catholic princes formed a league under the leadership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further secularization of church property , and if possible to regain some of the lands that had been lost to the church . THE BOHEMIAN REVOLT The incident which precipitated the Thirty Years ' War occurred in Bohemia . The Czech nobles , many of whom were Calvinist , feared that upon the accession of Ferdinand of Styria , who was a zealous Catholic , many of their privileges would be curtailed and Calvinism would be prohibited . They asserted the right to elect their own king , and in 1618 a delegation of Bohemian nobles broke into the imperial offices in Prague and hurled Ferdinand 's representatives out of a castle window some sixty feet above the ground . They were saved from serious injury by landing in a manure pile . The Bohemians then elected as their king , Frederick , the Palatine elector and leader of the Protestant League . In 1619 the emperor Matthias died and Ferdinand became emperor as Ferdinand II . He called upon the Catholic League and upon his Spanish cousin , Philip III , for help . The Bohemian phase of the Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick little support , and at the battle of White Hill in Bohemia he was decisively beaten by the forces of the Catholic League led by Count Tilly . The Spaniards invaded the Rhineland from the Netherlands , and with the assistance of the Bavarians seized the Palatinate which was eventually turned over to Maximilian of Bavaria . THE DANISH WAR Philip then resumed the Dutch War . England and France supported Holland , but the Spanish were successful against all three enemies . A Dutch attack on Brazil failed , as did an English attack on Cadiz . But the Hapsburg and Catholic successes alarmed the Protestants in northern Europe and Christian IV , the Lutheran king of Denmark ( 1588-1648 ) , decided to champion the Protestant cause . He was aided by generous grants of money from England . In 1625 Christian invaded Germany . Tilly and the Catholic  | League were aided by the extraordinary adventurer Wallenstein who had managed to acquire much of the wealth of the deposed Calvinist nobles of Bohemia whose estates were confiscated . Wallenstein raised a motley army of adventurers from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1626 at Lutter Christian IV was overwhelmingly defeated by the combined forces of Tilly and Wallenstein . A peace was finally arranged at Lubeck in 1629 . In the same year the emperor issued the Edict of Restitution by which all lands confiscated in violation of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 were to be restored to the Catholic Church . SWEDEN INTERVENES Norway , Sweden , and Denmark had been united in a single state under the king of Denmark in 1397 . But in the sixteenth century Sweden , with Finland , had broken away from the union and established an independent state with Gustavus Vasa ( 1523 ? 1560 ) as king . The country had adopted Lutheranism and the church came completely under the domination of the crown . The grandson of Vasa , Gustavus Adolphus ( 1611 ? 1632 ) , now decided that by assuming leadership of the Protestant cause he would be able to make Sweden the leading power in northern Europe . In his effort to dominate the Baltic , he had engaged in a series of wars with Russia which had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of Finland . He had wrested Livonia from Poland in a war which lasted from 1621 to 1629 . Gustavus now sought an opportunity of extending Swedish domination to the Baltic coasts of Germany . At the same time the Catholic Cardinal Richelieu cast about for a means of continuing the German struggle and thus of further weakening the Hapsburgs . The two arranged an alliance whereby Richelieu provided Gustavus with arms and money on condition that he would protect the free . dom of Catholic worship in conquered territories . In 1630 Gustavus landed in Pomerania where he occupied for , tresses and opened negotiations with the Protestant princes . Mean . while the Catholics besieged Magdeburg in 1630 . The massacre which followed the fall of the city brought Gustavus the prompt support of the German Protestants . Wallenstein 's private army had been disbanded and Tilly , who failed to check the Swedish advance , was killed in battle on the Leck in 1632 . Wallenstein was recalled   and quickly organized an army . At Lutzen in the same year the two armies met . Wallenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle was continued the advantage was increasingly with the imperial forces . Then in February 1634 Wallenstein was assassinated . Both sides were exhausted and a peace was arranged at Prague in 1635 . THE FRENCH PHASE OF THE WAR Richelieu now decided that it was time for France to intervene openly in order to break the Hapsburg domination of Europe . Ile counted upon the Swedes and Protestant princes to continue the fight against the emperor while France broke the power of Spain . The French period of the war lasted from 1635 to 1648 . For a while the seasoned Spanish armies were victorious ; in 1636 a Spanish army invaded northern France from the Netherlands and nearly captured Paris . In the following year another army invaded France from Spain . But as the French armies gained in experience they gradually turned the tide . The Dutch joined the French , and in 164o the Portuguese overthrew Spanish rule and re-established their independence . Revolts broke out in Naples and Aragon . And in 1643 the great reputation of the Spanish infantry was blasted by the French victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally terminated by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . This settlement was a very important one in European history . The empire was seriously weakened for each prince was given practical independence in his own realm , each being permitted to make war and peace without interference from the emperor . France received Alsace , Strasbourg , Metz , Toul and Verdun . Sweden obtained part of Pomerania and the bishopric of Bremen . The Hohenzollern state of Brandenburg was awarded eastern Pomerania and several bishoprics . Switzerland and Holland were recognized as independent states . Calvinists were to share the privileges accorded to Lutherans . Church property was to remain in the hands of whoever held it in 1624 . The Thirty Years ' War had begun as a religious struggle . Its   settlement was mainly political and economic , for by its close Europeans had come to recognize that it was possible for people o different religious faiths to live together amicably in the same state . The Hapsburg predominance was broken and the era of national states , all enjoying an equal international status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . A study of the relationships between nations , On the Law of War and Peace , had been published during the course of the war by Hugo Grotius , It Dutch Humanist . Germany , the chief battleground of the war , was left disunited and impoverished . The war between France and Spain was not ended by the Peace ( ) f Westphalia . That struggle dragged on for another eleven years , until 1659 . When it was finally concluded by the Treaty of the Pyrenees , exhausted Spain was already in decline . Philip IV was forced to surrender to France Rousillon and a strip of the Netherlands including Artois . Louis XIV married Philip 's daughter and pronounced any further claim to Spanish territories in return for a large dowry which Spain found itself too poor to pay . Development of Constitutional Monarchy in England THE LAST of the Tudor monarchs was Elizabeth . Like her predessors she was an absolute ruler . And like her predecessors Elizabeth wisely sought the co-operation and support of Parliament her government of England . This gesture of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national policy and the material prosperity which marked the Tudor era , contributed to make Elizabeth a popular ruler . Another point worth noting is that while Parliament remained subordinate under the Tudors , the fact that the Tudor monarchs treated that body with respect  | greatly increased its prestige and strengthened its claim to represent the nation . Elizabeth 's reign was marked by intense patriotism and pride 1 in English achievement . The profitable exploits of the buccaneers ' was climaxed by the defeat of the Great Armada and the humiliation of Spain . The English Renaissance reached a magnificent flowering during the reign of Elizabeth , particularly in the fields of literature and the drama . When Elizabeth died in 1603 she was succeeded by her cousin , King James VI of Scotland , son of the tragic Mary Queen of Scots , who ascended the English throne as James I. James very soon found himself at odds with Parliament over the question of royal finance . James was lacking in tact . When Parliament refused the subsidies ! he demanded , he proceeded to raise money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sale of titles of nobility , and the grant of monopolies . When Parliament protested , he arrested some members and sent others home . In 1621 Parliament drew up a " great protestation " against the king 's refusal to allow them to exercise traditional privileges and this was followed by the impeachment of the king 's treasurer . Another cause for dissatisfaction with the Stuart was religious . James had been raised a strict Anglican ; that is , he adhered to the doctrines and ceremonies of Catholicism and opposed Protestant ? ism while supporting the separation of the English church from Rome . But during Elizabeth 's reign Protestantism had spread widely among the middle classes , and its adherents continued to increase in numbers . We have already noted the Calvinist contempt for frivolity and gaiety and their hatred of " popish " ceremony and pomp in the churches . These Puritans , as they came to be called , tried to reform the Church of England from within and to make it Protestant in character . Others , variously called Congregationalists , Independents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accession of James , these groups presented a petition calling for the modification of church government ands ; ritual . In 1604 James declared that bishops and kings were sett over the people by God , and that he would force the Puritans to conform or harry them out of the land . The wisdom of James ' foreign policy was not appreciated by the English . Scotland had long been an enemy country , and the English defeated James ' attempt to unite the two countries . They ,  | condemned him for his peaceful policy and his refusal to aid the Bohemians in their revolt against the Catholic emperor . And Parliament repeatedly protested against James ' conciliatory policy toward Spain , and his attempt to arrange for the marriage of his son Charles to a Spanish princess . When James died in 1625 , the ground had already been prepared for a conflict between the Stuart monarchy on one hand and the Parliament and people on the other . CHARLES I When Charles I ( 1625 ? 1649 ) succeeded his father upon the throne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and Parliament might be ended . Charles was personally popular . He assured Parliament that he would grant no concessions to the Catholics . Having been jilted by his Spanish fiancee , he shared Parliament 's hostility toward Spain . But at the time of his marriage to Henrietta Maria , daughter of Louis XIII of France , he secretly assured the French government that he would make general concessions to the English Catholics . In anticipation of the war with Spain , Parliament granted subsidies . But Charles used up these funds , and demanded additional grants without showing any inclination to begin hostilities . Parliament then limited the collection of customs duties to one year , withheld further subsidies , and attacked the ambitious favorite of the king , the Duke of Buckingham . Charles dissolved Parliament . Popular dissatisfaction was further increased by the failure of the English attack on Cadiz , and the failure to relieve the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle which was taken by Richelieu in 1628 . Charles ' attempt to raise money by forced loans failed , and in 1628 he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the king to sign an agreement , the Petition of Right , by which he promised he would not levy taxes without the consent of Parliament or establish martial law or quarter soldiers on private citizens or order arbitrary imprisonment . The assassination of the Duke of Buckingham ended the controversy over his dismissal which was demanded by Parliament . Exasperated by further parliamentary demands , Charles tried to rule without it from 1629 to 1640 . In order to obtain much deeded funds , Charles revived old feudal customs , employed the  | courts to collect enormous fines , and sold trade monopolies which resulted in high prices on commodities . In 1634 he demanded the payment of " ship-money " by the seaboard towns in substitution for the ships which they normally provided for the defense of tine kingdom in time of trouble . The trial and condemnation of the Puritan , John Hampden , for his refusal to pay ship-money made him a national hero . With the appointment of William Laud as archbishop of Canterbury , the laws against Catholics were relaxed and this further aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch church , Scotland revolted . Charles was now forced to call Parliament in order to raise money to protect England against the advancing Scotch armies . This disputatious Short Parliament was quickly dissolved , but Charles was soon forced to summon Parliament again . The Parliament which met in 1640 is known as the Long Parliament for its session lasted until 1660 . Under the leadership of such men as John Pym , John Hampden , and Oliver Cromwell , this Parliament insisted that supreme authority rested in the House of Commons which might disregard the acts of the king and the House of Lords . Archbishop Laud and Thomas Wentworth , earl of Strafford , were impeached and sent to the Tower . Charles ' special courts , including the Court of Star Chamber , were abolished . And the king was required to summon a Parliament every three years . Charles entered the House of Commons and attempted to arrest a number of its leaders . Parliament issued a call to arms and civil war was launched . Around the king rallied the Anglicans and Catholics , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritans . Thus began the struggle between the " Cavaliers " and the " Round-heads , " so called because of the close-cropped hair of the parliamentary soldiery . A solemn league and covenant was arranged between Parliament and the Scots by which religious uniformity was to be established on the Presbyterian basis . The war was brief . Charles was defeated at Marston Moor in 1644 . The " New Model " army and Cromwell 's cavalry force known as the " Ironsides " who charged into battle singing psalms vigorously carried on the war . At Naseby in 1645 Charles was again defeated . He surrendered the following year . Parliament was purged of its irresolute members by Colonel Pride , and the Independent minority  | or " Rump " Parliament condemned Charles to death . He was be ! waded January 30 , 1649 . THE COMMONWEALTH AND PROTECTORATE The Rump remained in session and Oliver Cromwell was dispaitched to Ireland to put down the Catholic rebellion which had broken out there . Parliament had expected to continue to govern England , but Oliver Cromwell , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator of England , first with the aid of a legislative body of his own choosing and then under a constitution which set up a " Protectorate . " Cromwell , although representing an insignificant majority of Independents , retained his control of England until his death in ' , 1658 . He had the support of a well-disciplined army . He maintained order , and during his rule commerce and industry prospered . He arranged profitable trade treaties with Holland and France , and conducted a war against Spain which won England Dunkirk , the island of Jamaica , and many shiploads of Spanish silver . But upon his death no satisfactory government was established , and in 166o Charles Stuart , son of the beheaded king , was called to England to resume the throne as Charles II ( 166o-1685 ) . THE LATER STUARTS The English were sick of Puritan rule with its suppression of nces and games and other healthy forms of recreation . Charles was hailed enthusiastically . The royalist nobility in both Scotland . end England were also restored along with the king . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook . and they were no more ready to submit to absolute monarchy than are the Puritans . But Charles and his brother James were stanch Catholics and liampions of monarchical absolutism . It was not long before the differences between the Stuarts and their subjects provoked parliamentary opposition to the crown . Parliament tried to control the I. i ng by withholding grants , and by claiming the right to devote its rants of funds to specific purposes for which it required an accounting . When in 1672 James , heir to the throne , openly espoused Ca- tholicism and Charles relaxed the restrictions affecting Catholics , England was thrown into a panic lest , with the aid of foreign troops , the monarch attempt to restore Catholicism in England . In 1679 Parliament attempted to exclude James from the succession because of his Catholicism . But above all else the English wished to avoid the outbreak of another civil war . Two factions , the Whigs and the Tories , disagreed as to how far it might be possible to go without risking another civil war . When Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the duke of Monmouth , Charles ' illegitimate son and a Protestant , organized a rebellion . Both outbreaks were put down , however , and the Catholic James took the throne as James II ( 1685-1688 ) . James at once attempted to create a standing army officered by Catholics . In 1687 he issued a " declaration of indulgence " which exempted Catholics and dissenters from punishment for the infraction of parliamentary laws against them . In 1688 he issued another such declaration which he ordered to be read in all Anglican churches . For a time the English suffered the rule of James in the expectation that upon his death and the accession of his Protestant daughters there would be a change for the better . But when James ' Catholic second wife gave birth to a son , other factions joined the Whigs in putting an end to Stuart rule . THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION James ' elder daughter Mary was married to William of Orange . Upon the invitation of Whig and Tory leaders , William crossed into England with an army in 1688 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 168g Parliament issued a Declaration of Rights , which was enacted into law as the Bill of Rights . It clearly established limitations on the king 's power and established in England a rule of king and Parliament . Money grants were to be made for the period of one year , which made necessary the regular calling of Parliament . The English revolution had been attended by violence as we have seen . But despite involvement in foreign wars , the English were able to work out a solution of their problems without foreign interference in their internal affairs . Although stirred into rebellion by the abuse of monarchical power , they were none-the-less   unwilling to destroy utterly the institution which had provided a satisfactory national government for so many centuries . Instead of destroying their government , therefore , they addressed themselves to the task of eliminating particular abuses of autocratic power , and of setting up safeguards against the re-establishment of those abuses . Russia and Sweden DuRING three quarters of a century which elapsed between the election of the Romanoff family to the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , west Europeans visited Russia in increasing numbers . Through such contacts Russians became familiar with west European customs and ideas . However , while this contact was sufficient to make many Russians aware of the civilization of western Europe it was not sufficient to bring about any important change in Russian life . The Europeanization of Russia was begun in the time of Peter the Great and was continued by Catherine and later rulers down to the present day . PETER THE GREAT Peter , who was born in 1672 , technically succeeded to the Russian throne when he was ten years old , a rule which he shared jointly with his feeble-minded half-brother Ivan under the regency of an older sister Sophia . In other words he became half-czar along with his half-witted half-brother . He received little formal education and was always uncouth in manner and violent in temper . When Peter reached the age of seventeen , he and a group of   conspirators seized control of the government and placed Sophia in a convent . His reign is usually dated from this act which took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extraordinary vigor and strength in both body and mind . He was six feet eight and one half inches tall , tireless in body and mind . Ivan died in 1696 leaving Peter sole czar . Peter had seized Azov from the Turks and determined to strengthen his position by seeking alliances with the European states against the Turkish enemy . He organized an embassy which he himself accompanied as Peter Mikhailov , for he was anxious to study the customs of Europe at first hand . As Peter Mikhailov he visited factories , shipyards , schools , arsenals , docks , hospitals . In Holland he worked as a carpenter in order to master the technique of shipbuilding . He induced craftsmen and technicians of all sorts to return with him to Russia in order to train Russians to a mastery of European techniques . Peter was suddenly called home by a revolt of his standing army , the Streltsi . By the time he reached home the revolt had been suppressed , but Peter insisted upon inflicting severe punishment . Many were tortured and Peter himself took pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETER 'S REFORMS Having punished revolt , Peter proceeded to introduce west : . European innovations into Russian life . He organized and equipped an army along European lines . He built a small navy which met with success against the Swedes in the Baltic and the Turks in the Black Sea . Peter had acquired some knowledge of new mercantilist theory during his travels in Europe and accordingly he sought to build up Russian industries and export manufactured goods in order to make Russia prosperous . He also tried to reform the manners of the Russians by insisting that women leave the harems and appear in public without veils . He taught his courtiers to dance and to smoke tobacco . With his own hands he cut off the beards and the long skirted garments of his Muscovite nobles . Observing that the conservative Orthodox Church was hostile to his reforms , Peter refrained from appointing a successor to the Patriarch Adrian who died in 1700 . He finally abolished the office of patriarch and brought the Russian church under the control of the crown .   WAR WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden under the house of Vasa , and have reviewed the military exploits of Gustavus Vasa and of his grandson , Gustavus Adolphus . We have also seen how Ivan the Terrible was blocked when he attempted to open a Russian port on the Baltic , a " window to the west . " When Peter came to the throne , Russia 's only port was Archangel on the White Sea which was ice-blocked a large part of the year . Peter seized Azov on the Black Sea at the opening of of his reign . He then turned his attention to the Baltic . When Charles XI of Sweden died in 1697 he left as his successor a fifteen-year-old son who became Charles XII . At once a group of European powers , Denmark , Poland , and Russia , formed a coalition to seize Swedish territories at a time when the monarchy seemed weak . But the young king proved to be a military genius more than equal to the emergency . Charles did not wait for his enemies to attack . He moved quickly against each of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , 1700 , he invaded Denmark and forced its king , Frederick IV , to withdraw from the coalition . Peter of Russia had meanwhile invaded Ingria and laid siege to Narva . With only 8,000 men Charles attacked the Russian army of about 40,000 . The badly organized Russians were put to rout . Had Charles been able to follow up his victory by pursuing the Russian soldiery he might have forced Russia out of the war . But it was necessary to attack Poland quickly . Here again Charles met with success . He deposed the Polish Augustus the Strong and forced the Poles to accept a king of his own choosing , Stanislaus reszczynski . Charles was occupied with the conquest and reorganization of Poland for seven years during which time Peter created a new army , better equipped and disciplined than the last . To meet this new threat Charles collected an army of 30,000 and in 1708 advanced into Russia . Peter adopted the same tactics which at a later date were to defeat Napoleon . He withdrew before the Swedes , destroying supplies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army was given no rest as the retreating Peter drew the enemy deeper and deeper into Russia .   In June 1709 , Peter turned upon his weakened foe . Almost the entire Swedish army was destroyed or captured . Charles XII , however , escaped into Turkey where he succeeded in arousing the Turks to make war on the Russians . During the course of the long Turkish war , Peter was forced to surrender Azov to the Turks . Then when Charles felt he could do no more in Turkey , he crossed Russia in disguise and took up the war at home . In 1718 he was killed while fighting in Norway . The Age of Louis XIV THE INSTITUTION of national monarchy , which we have seen developing in all parts of Europe , became most powerful and glorious in France during the reign of Louis XIV . We have seen how the way was prepared for Louis XIV by the work of Richelieu and Mazarin . Louis was a child of five when in 1643 his father , Louis XIII , died . Although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became thirteen , he took no active part in his government while Mazarin lived . However Louis studied the work of his great minister and , when Mazarin died in 1661 , announced that from thenceforth the king would be his own chief minister . THE GOVERNMENT OF LOUIS Xs ' - ' Louis worked hard at the business of government . He surrounded himself with able advisers , but all decisions were his . His ministers were grouped into councils of State , Finance , Justice , and Interior . Louis presided in person over all but the court . There was no rigidity to this organization for Louis did not hesitate to shift his able  | organizer Colbert from one ministry to the other wherever his services might prove most valuable . Colbert was a bourgeois , that is a non-noble townsman . As finance minister , he reformed many abuses and built up a surplus in the treasury as early as 1667 . He was a mercantilist in his views , and accordingly fostered the development of French industry . The mercantile theory of the time held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the export of goods to a greater value than imports . It would be necessary , as a result , for foreign ( purchasers to pay this " balance of trade " in money . The quantity of precious metals or money in the hands of the people and government of a state thus represented its wealth . Since manufactured goods were of greater value than raw materials , it was the aim of mercantilist statesmen to encourage industry and to discourage the import of manufactures from other countries . To this end Louis ' government , under Colbert 's management , subsidized new French industries and protected them with tariffs on foreign products . In 1664 an East India Company and a West India Company were founded . Their purpose was to develop trade and colonization . Attempts were made to establish French settlers in the West Indies , in Madagascar , and in India . The minister of war , Louvois , reformed and enlarged the French army . He introduced for the first time on any scale a standard uniform , marching in step , and regular drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social position merely ? merit was taken account of . Vauban , the great engineer , built a series of fortresses along the eastern boundary of France , and constructed base hospitals and supply depots . VERSAILLES As we observed during our review of the Renaissance in Italy , writers , dramatists , poets , artists , sculptors , and musicians , depended upon noble , royal and ecclesiastical patrons to provide them with employment and a living . Louis , as the greatest monarch of his time , distributed grants and employments to artists , musicians , and writers ? many of whose names are famous in our own time . Lully was brought from Florence to become court musician . Racine , Moliere , Corneille , La Fontaine , Bossuet , are some of the names which grace the literature of the period .  | Architects , artists , and sculptors were employed in the erection and decoration of the magnificent palace Louis built at Versailles , a few miles outside Paris . The palace of Versailles was not built merely to gratify a vain monarch . It became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French greatness . Versailles intensified every Frenchman 's pride in being a Frenchman . Versailles was also the last step in the complete subjection of the nobility to the monarchy . While the nobles were occupied with ceremonies , entertainments , and social intrigues , Louis ruled France . Many of the nobles , who were required to attend court by their king , ceased altogether from personally administering their estates . The peasants paid them taxes , but it was the king who represented government , order , justice , and who reflected the glory and power of France . LOUIS AND THE HUGUENOTS Louis XIV was a devout Catholic . The pope he acknowledged to be supreme in the matter of doctrine , but in other matters the church was subject to the will of the monarch . The religious unity of the state was an ideal of an earlier age which Louis cherished . By a narrow interpretation of the Edict of Nantes , pressure was brought upon the Huguenots to force their conversion to Catholicism . Finally Louis was assured by his enthusiastic advisers that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme measures were used to bring these stubborn few into line . Companies of soldiers were quartered in the homes of the Huguenots and were encouraged to conduct themselves in such a way as to break the spirit of the Calvinists . At last , in 1685 , the Edict of Nantes was revoked . The king 's act was hailed with approval throughout France . THE WARS OF LOUIS XIV Louis was married to Marie Therese , daughter of Philip IV of Spain . Louis , it will be recalled , had agreed to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for his wife or his heirs in consideration of the large dowry to be paid out of the Spanish treasury . But that dowry had not been paid ; Spain was too poor . When Philip IV died in 1665 and was succeeded by Charles II , his son by a second marriage , Louis XIV claimed the Netherlands for France . He based his claim  | upon a Dutch custom under which children of a first marriage inherited their father 's property to the exclusion of children of subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands , the Dutch and the English quickly put an end to their war , and joined Sweden in an alliance against France . This was an effort to maintain the balance of power among the European states and to prevent the domination of Europe by France . Louis withdrew from the war , but retained about a dozen Flemish towns . Louis next proceeded to isolate Holland diplomatically by making treaties of friendship and non-aggression with her allies Sweden and England . When all was prepared , he invaded Holland without a formal declaration of war in 1672 . The Dutch opened the ( likes and flooded the country around Amsterdam thus saving the ity . William III of Orange then arranged alliances with Austria , Spain , Brandenburg , and Denmark . After several more years of war , the treaty of Nimwegen of 1678 awarded Louis FrancheComte and a number of Flemish towns . Thus Spain was again the loser . In the very next year Louis set up Chambers of Reunion which searched the records of the past , and set up claims to territories which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France . On the basis of their researches , he claimed all of Alsace as well as other territories , and sent his armies to take possession for him . The nations were alarmed afresh at this latest aggression . Spain , Holland , Savoy , Austria , and many small German states formed the League of Augsburg , and when William of Orange accepted the English throne , England too joined the oalition . The war of the League of Augsburg lasted nearly a decade . While the French navy was defeated by the combined fleets of the English and Dutch , Vauban 's line of fortresses protected France I rom invasion . Nevertheless , after nine years of warfare France was so exhausted that Louis was forced to give up all the territory he had conquered during the war except Strasbourg . THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION The idiotic Charles II of Spain was childless . Next in line of accession was the Dauphin of France and his three sons . However ,  | as Louis had renounced all claims to Spanish inheritance , the strongest claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his second son , the archduke Charles . But the Spanish remembered that they had been abandoned by the German Hapsburgs at the close of the Thirty Years ' War , and were thereby forced to carry on the struggle with France alone . They were therefore inclined to favor the French heir if they could be assured that Spain would not become united to France . Louis ' ambassadors persuaded the feeble-minded Spanish king to will his crown to Louis ' grandson , Philip of Anjou . Upon the death of Charles II in 1700 , King Louis hailed his grandson as Philip V , king of Spain . Had he reassured the other European states that he had no intention of uniting the crowns of Spain and France , Louis might have avoided another war , but he failed to do so . The War of the Spanish Succession was fought in Europe and in the colonies . We can not here follow the development of hostilities in America and in India , in the Netherlands , the Germanies , Spain and Italy . The allied forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marlborough , and by prince Eugene of Savoy . At Ramillies in 1706 , at Oudenarde in 1708 , and at Malplaquet in 1709 , Louis ' armies were defeated by Marlborough . The war was finally brought to a close in 1713 by the treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt ( 1714 ) . Philip inherited the Spanish throne as Philip V on condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be united . The emperor received the Spanish Netherlands which now became the Austrian Netherlands , Naples , Milan , and the island of Sardinia which was later exchanged for Sicily . France retained Alsace , but lost a vast colonial empire for England received Nova Scotia , the Hudson 's Bay territory , Newfoundland , as well as Gibraltar and Minorca . The Hohenzollern elector of Brandenburg became king in Prussia , and the duke of Savoy became king of Sardinia , and each received increases of territory . France , exhausted by the long wars , had had a surfeit of glory . When Louis XIV died in 1715 the French people rejoiced .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history is the Europeanization of the globe . This European predominance was attained in two ways : firstly , through exploration and settlement carried on aggressively by the principal European states over a period of several centuries ; secondly , by the adoption of many of the techniques of European civilization by the peoples of other sections of the globe . This Europeanizing movement began with the opening of the era of exploration in the fifteenth century . The Portuguese , who first developed an empire in the East , were seeking primarily trade . They established trading posts along the coasts of Asia and in the islands of the East Indies , but were prevented from attempting colonization by two factors . These were : lack of man power ? the Portuguese population in the fifteenth century numbered not more than a million , and the fact that the lands which they visited were for the most part already densely populated . In the western hemisphere the situation was different . In order for these lands to yield the products that were so much in demand in the European market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently the Spaniards settled in America , established plantations , developed agricultural experiment , founded towns and cities and adorned them with churches and schools and universities . This aspect of Spanish colonization is often obscured in the accounts by an emphasis upon the more exciting narrative of the search after gold and silver . Every schoolboy is familiar with Ponce de Leon 's picturesque quest of the Fountain of Youth , with Cortes 's conquest of Mexico , with Pizarro 's search for El Dorado .   He is likely to pass lightly over the fact that the great Latin civilization to the south of the United States was the product of centuries 4 settlement and of patient and intelligent development . THE SEARCH FOR A SEA PASSAGE TO THE EAST Much of the demand for eastern products was created by the increase of industry throughout all Europe . For example , the English cloth industry relied upon dyes and other products which were brought from the East by Portugal and Spain . So great was England 's dependence upon Spain in this respect that in Elizabeth 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon England , might seize half of English shipping in Spanish waters . The English were , as we saw , eager to find a northwest or a northeast passage to Asia and to free themselves thereby from dependence upon Spain . It was not until English explorers failed in their search for a passage to the East that English colonization was seriously undertaken . Even then , although various plans of colonization were worked out , the English government found them too expensive and risky . English colonization was the result of private enterprise . French fishermen from Brittany and Normandy voyaged to the Newfoundland fishing grounds as early as 1504 and within a decade this became an annual practice . In 1524 Francis I employed the Florentine Verrazano to explore the North American coast in search of a sea passage to the Pacific . A decade later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence as far as the Lachine ( China ) Rapids . But it was not until the early seventeenth century that the French established settlements in Nova Scotia , and at Quebec in 1604 and 16o8 . DUTCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese and Spanish monopoly of trade with the newly discovered lands in both hemispheres . By the middle of the seventeenth century , the Dutch mercantile fleet was the largest in the world . Toward the end of the sixteenth century the Dutch landed in Java , expelled the Portuguese , and made treaties with the natives . The rapid Dutch development of trade and colonization in the East Indies led to the formation of the Dutch East India Company which established a governor-general in Java , who supervised Dutch governments in   Celebes , Amboyna , Macassar , Malacca , Banda , Ternate , Coromandel , and the Cape of Good Hope . The Dutch by degrees drove the Portuguese out of nearly all their eastern possessions . As a result of the explorations of Henry Hudson , an Englishman in the employ of the Dutch who explored the Hudson River and claimed the region for Holland in 16og , a Dutch West India Company was formed in 1621 . A settlement was made on Manhattan Island and was named New Amsterdam . The Dutch also seized part of Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence from Spain in 164o . FRENCH SETTLEMENT From Quebec , founded by Champlain in 16o8 , French trading posts were established throughout the northern part of the North American continent , and a profitable commerce in furs was developed with the American Indians . It was not until the reign of Louis XIV that large scale exploration and settlement were undertaken . La Salle explored the region of the Great Lakes while the Jesuits , Marquette and Joliet sailed down the Mississippi in Indian canoes . In 1682 La Salle followed up the explorations of the missionaries and reached the Gulf of Mexico . Claiming the great central region of the American continent for France , he named it Louisiana in honor of the king . French colonial activity was not confined to America , however . In the seventeenth century , French captains explored the Indian Ocean and claimed the islands of Reunion and Mauritius . With the founding of the French East India Company in 1664 by Colbert , their activities increased . Between 1668 and 1674 depots or factories were established at Surat , Masulipatam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration to colonization . A careful study was made of Spanish agricultural experiments in the colonies , and lands were sought suitable for the raising of the products customarily imported from the East . After several unsuccessful attempts , the first permanent English settlement in America was established at Jamestown in 1607 by the Virginia Company .   It was not until more than a dozen years later that permanent settlements were established in the north when the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth on Cape Cod in 162o . In 1629 the Massachusetts Bay Company was granted a charter and many Puritans sought in the American wilderness the religious freedom that was denied to them at home . Massachusetts , Connecticut and Rhode Island were thus settled . In 1634 Leonard Calvert , son of Lord Baltimore , founded a colony on Chesapeake Bay under a charter granted to his father , as a refuge for Roman Catholics . Other settlements were later founded in Carolina . Separating the northern and southern English colonies in America ww as the Dutch territory of New Netherlands . Ignoring Dutch claims , Charles II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , in 1664 , who thereupon seized New Amsterdam and renamed it New fork . The coastal region to the south of New York was divided up into New Jersey and Delaware , and in 1681 the unoccupied inland region was awarded to William Penn , and became known as Pennsylvania , or Penn 's Woods . In 1682 the Friends , or Quakers , I founded the city of Philadelphia which , because of the toleration u tended to all faiths , soon attracted settlers from different parts if Europe . The English also settled in Bermuda and in many islands of the West Indies , which became an important source of the sugar that at a later date was carried to Puritan New England and manufactured into rum . The East India Company established by Elizabeth in 1600 maintained a spice trade with the East Indies until driven out by the Dutch . The English company then turned its attention to the development of trade with India . Here the English were successful i n driving out the Portuguese . Trading depots were set up at Surat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH IN AMERICA When William of Orange ascended the English throne as William III in 1689 , England joined the League of Augsburg in its war against Louis XIV . In America the war between the French and English and their Indian allies became known as King William 's War . With the establishment of peace in Europe in 1697 , the   colonies were forced to restore the land they had taken from each other . When France and England were again opposed in Louis XIV 's last war , the War of the Spanish Succession , the American colonies took up the struggle in what became known as Queen Anne 's War . The colonists and their Indian allies again launched a series of bloody massacres . French Acadia was seized and later became the British colony of Nova Scotia . By the treaty of Utrecht in 1713 , as we recalled earlier , France gave up Nova Scotia , Newfoundland , and the Hudson 's Bay territory . France retained Louisiana and a large region on either side of the St. Lawrence which extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortresses from the St. Lawrence to New Orleans in order to protect their remaining American possessions . A struggle between England and Spain over the mistreatment of English seamen by the Spaniards became known as the War of Jenkins ' Ear because an Englishman of that name brought home with him the ear he claimed had been cut from his head by a Spaniard . This war soon became merged in the War of the Austrian Succession . The French then attacked the English colonists and opened the American phase of the struggle which became known as King George 's War ( 1740 ? 1748 ) . But when peace was restored no change was made in the English and French territories in North America . The next contest between England and France broke out in the colonies before hostilities were begun in Europe . This was the French and Indian War which was one aspect or phase of the Seven Years ' War in Europe . In America hostilities were precipitated by the activities of the French in fortifying the borders of Louisiana and in their incitement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unofficially in America in 1755 , although war was not declared in Europe until 1756 . The English armies sent to America under the command of General Braddock met with disaster when they encountered Indian fighting . It was only after a series of defeats that the British gave sufficient attention to the war in the colonies . The tide was turned , and a series of British victories sealed the fate of French rule in America . The capture of Louisburg , of Fort Duquesne , of Ticonderoga and Crown Point , and the final brilliant taking of Quebec in 1759 by General Wolfe , mark the progress of the war . West Indian   Wands , including Martinique and Guadeloupe , were taken from the French as well as posts on the West African coast . From France 's ally , Spain , the British took Havana and the Philippine Islands . In India the French governor of Pondicherry , Dupleix , attacked and took Madras from the British during the War of the Austrian Succession . After the conclusion of peace , he sought to weaken the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the dazzling success of the Englishman Clive in avenging an Indian attack upon the English post at Trichinopoly raised British prestige and many chiefs transferred their support from the French to the British . During the Seven Years ' War , Clive again won a series of brilliant victories over the native princes and the French with a force almost unbelievably inferior in numbers to the enemy . When peace was concluded in Paris in 1763 , the French were allowed to retain only their trading stations in India . Canada and all of Louisiana east of the Mississippi , except New Orleans , was ceded to the British . The remainder of Louisiana was turned over to Spain . In exchange for the return of Havana and Manila the Spanish ceded Florida to the British . The French colonial power was broken , and the foundation of the British empire firmly laid . The Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions THE era of political revolution in Europe was preceded and as companied by a development of techniques that was at least as revolutionary in its effects . Indeed the two developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of the other . Both the agricultural and the industrial revolutions were the result of the application of scientific knowl. edge to the techniques of production .   THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION It would be possible to trace the history of agricultural improvement in Europe back to the Middle Ages . However , the term agricultural revolution generally refers to the acceleration of that development which occurred in the early eighteenth century . 1 n 1733 Jethro Tull published in England his Horse-Hoeing Husbandry which was the product of experiments conducted upon his own farm after extensive observation of agricultural methods employed on the continent . Tull had experimented with a horse-drawn implement of his own devising which broke up the soil and facilitated the nourishment of plants . He also created a machine which deposited seeds in parallel rows , making possible the use of machinery in cultivation . During the Middle Ages the feeding of livestock during the long winter months had been a serious problem . The supply of natural grasses which could be stored for fodder was limited , and it was the general custom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining only sufficient cattle to breed new flocks in the spring . Under such conditions , the food supply was strictly limited . During the seventeenth century turnips were grown for fodder , and in the eighteenth century the cultivation of turnips , clover , and artificial grasses provided fodder without exhausting the soil . This obviated the necessity for assigning a portion of the cultivated land to lie idle or fallow while its fertility was restored . It also made possible the maintenance of larger herds of livestock . In the early eighteenth century Lord Townshend , later nicknamed " Turnip " Townshend , applied the technique developed by Tull to the raising of turnips . He and his successors experimented with various methods of fertilizing the soil , and of preserving its fertility by the rotation of crops . The improvement of industry and the growth of the towns increased the market for butcher 's meat , and this in turn led to experiments in the improvement of livestock by selective breeding . Robert Bakewell was one of the eighteenth century pioneers in this field . Sheep , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakewell for food . He developed a breed known as the New Leicesters which were noted for their large bodies , fine flesh , and which reached maturity a year or two earlier than other breeds .   Bakewell 's example was quickly followed with the result that during the eighteenth century the size of meat-producing animals was roughly trebled . Similar experiments were conducted with dairy c attle , and thus the milk production of animals was often doubled . The methods of the innovators were popularized by Arthur Young 1741-1820 ) who wrote books and lectured about the new agricc ultural experiments . He founded a monthly magazine , Annals of Agriculture , which was subscribed to by gentlemen farmers in France , Prussia , and America , as well as by large numbers of upper ( lass Englishmen . But it was necessary to segregate animals which were being bred for the development of special characteristics . This led to the abandonment of the medieval common pasture land used freely by the whole community . The large landholders were able to " enclose " portions of the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer or by ignoring them . The " enclosure " movement , the tendency of landholders to infringe upon the common or public land , was not new ; it had been a problem in Tudor times . Clearly the small farmer could not afford to set aside fields for experiment . The men who brought about the agricultural revolution were of the landed aristocracy , men who had accumulated capital in the expanding commerce of England . They were the same merchant-adventurers who formed companies and sent out settlers to establish colonies . They were the leaders of the political revolution which had driven out James and set William upon the English throne . They were the men who ruled England from the " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 until the nineteenth century . THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION The industrial revolution was fundamentally the replacement of handcraft by power-driven machinery . It was a change unique in human history . In its broader aspects this revolution involved the development of large-scale capitalistic enterprise , changes in the status of the laboring man , population shifts and increase , and new social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was new . Capitalism was not new ; big cities were not new ; nor were labor problems . In an early chapter we referred to the invention of a steam engine by the Hellenistic Greek , Hero of Alexandria . It is important to note however that Hero 's invention remained a curi- osity in the museum at Alexandria ? it was not put to practical use . Obviously it is impossible to establish a date for the beginning of what we have come to think of as the industrial revolution . But till ? changes which characterize it have been evident through the eighteenth century , and have continued down to the present day . A method for smelting iron with coal and lime was discovered in i 709 , and thus made available the material out of which most powerdriven machinery was made . As early as 1718 a silk factory was opened in Derby which was equipped with power-driven machinery . Factors which contributed to the rapid development of machinery in England were the expanded commerce which opened up new markets for English goods , the availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fact that the wealthy , powerful , and educated classes of England fostered the new development . It would be possible to list a great many inventions which played a part in the revolution of industrial technique . The water-driven silk-spinning machinery installed in his factory in 1718 by Thomas Lombe stimulated the invention of other types of spinning machinery for both silk and cotton . Kay 's flying shuttle was patented in 1733 . Hargreaves ' spinning jenny of 1765 and Arkwright 's waterframe were combined by Crompton in 1779 in the mule which was capable of producing cotton threads of new strength and fineness . A cylindrical press for printing colored patterns on cotton fabrics and Cartwright 's power-driven loom enabled England to produce cheaply great quantities of fine cotton fabric which she supplied to markets all over the world . The growth of the English textile industry created a huge market for American cotton , and when in 1793 the American Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin for separating cotton fibres from the seed , the American South was able to meet the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine hand-spun and hand-woven cotton cloths of India had been a luxury in demand all over the world . Now the machine industry of England produced finer yarns and fabrics , varied in design , so cheaply and in such quantity that English cotton cloth competed successfully with Indian in India itself . In this fashion India was conquered by European industrial technique at the same time that she was gradually falling into political subjection to Europe . Of course , the development of the textile industry is but one phase of the industrial revolution . But let us turn to the effects of the new industry upon the lives of men .   The Enlightened Despots DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY there ruled in Europe a groin , of monarchs who became known as enlightened and benevolent despots ? enlightened , because they were not only patrons of learning and the arts but because they were themselves accomplished in those refinements ; benevolent , because they were hard-working rulers who actively labored to improve the condition of their subjects because they were intelligent enough to see that their own prestige and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; despots , because they jealously guarded and sought to strengthen their autocratic hold upon the states which they governed . Chief among them were Catherine the Great of Russia , Frederick the Great of Prussia , Maria Theresa and Joseph II of Austria . RUSSIA AND CATHERINE THE GREAT Between the death of Peter the Great in 1725 and the accession of the Czarina Elizabeth in 1741 , Russia was ruled by a number of weak Romanoffs , two of them women . Elizabeth , who was childless , wished to preserve the Romanoff succession in Russia . She therefore called to Russia her nephew , Peter , who was the son of her sister Anna and the German duke of Holstein-Gathorp , for whom she then proceeded to arrange a marriage with Sophia of Anhalt . The prospective empress , Sophia , gave up her Lutheran faith and adopted that of the Russian Orthodox Church . She took the name of Catherine , mastered the Russian language , and sought to identify herself with her people . But Catherine found herself neglected and   mistreated by her boorish husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with the ancient classics and the writings of such leading contemporary thinkers as Voltaire , Montesl uieu , and the Encyclopedists . Elizabeth died in 1761 and Peter became czar . Regarding himself A Lutheran and a German , he treated his subjects and their church ith contempt . It was not long before the Russians came to think of Peter as the foreigner and of Catherine as the Russian . Catherine skillfully fostered hatred of the emperor and loyalty to herself . In 1762 , while Peter was at his country estate with his Holstein regii i ient , Catherine was taken to St. Petersburg where she was Acclaimed empress by the Russian troops . A few days later Peter 's death was reported . Catherine immediately assumed the direction of the affairs of state . She employed able men in her government , and showed an ; appreciation of the services of those who served her well . Catherine revealed her German origins by the attention she gave to building up her European reputation . She corresponded with the foremost philosophers and literary figures of her time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such interest that she was hailed as a liberal . But in fact , while Catherine contemplated and proposed many reforms , she made little actual change in the organization of Russian life . For this she is often severely criticized , although it would be well for us to remember that Russia was in no way ready for the kind of reforms being discussed so widely in western Europe . A series of revolts among the peasants , one of them led by Pugashev in 1773 who pretended that he was Peter III , checked any reform of serfdom that Catherine may have attempted . No general educational reform was possible for there were no teachers . Catherine continued therefore to exercise her autocratic sway in Russia while she pleased the taste of the western elite by giving her encouragement and patronage to the most advanced thinkers of the time . The territories of Russia were greatly enlarged during the reign of Catherine . It was during Catherine 's reign that Russia won access to the Black Sea and a port in the south . Peter the Great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade , but was finally forced to restore the region to Turkey . Catherine provoked the Turks into a declaration of war in 1768 . At the conclusion of the struggle in 1774 , Catherine was ceded Azov and several strongholds  | north of the Black Sea . A second Turkish war , which ended in 1792 , sanctioned Catherine 's annexation of the Crimea . THE PARTITIONS OF POLAND However the greatest accession of territory was achieved at the expense of Poland . In the eighteenth century Poland , extending front the Baltic almost to the Black Sea , was the third largest country Europe . Only Russia and Sweden were larger . In population it ' was fourth . But despite its size Poland was a weak state . A very poor peasantry was governed by a stupid and greedy nobility . The kingship was elective and its power curtailed by a diet which , through a practice known as the liberum veto , was almost incapable of taking any responsible action . By a single vote any one of the nobles was able to block action by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these men continued to make impossible any effective action to protect the country . Upon the death of August III in 1763 , Catherine sent troops to Poland to support her candidate for the throne , Stanislaus Poniatowski . Soon Catherine and Frederick the Great of Prussia opened negotiations with Maria Theresa of Austria leading to the partitioning of Polish territories . In 1772 the powers agreed that Prussia would take West Prussia excepting the cities of Danzig and Thom ; Austria received Galicia ; and Russia seized " White Russia " which had been lost to her in the Middle Ages . In spite of the efforts of Poniatowski to organize and defend what remained of his kingdom , the rest of Poland was seized and divided up in 1793 and by a final partition in 1795 . PRUSSIA AND FREDERICK THE GREAT The German national state was created by the Hohenzollerns . The Hohenzollerns , like the Austrian Hapsburgs and the House of Savoy under which Italy was united , were for long minor vassals of the Holy Roman Empire . In 1417 Frederick of Hohenzollern , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or march of Bradenburg by the emperor Sigismund in reward for services . By shrewd marriage alliances , and by getting into wars on the winning side , the Hohenzollerns gradually increased their dominion . The military might of Prussia was founded by Frederick William   the Great , Elector of Bradenberg ( 164o-1688 ) , and built up by Frederick William I , King of Prussia ( 1713-1740 ) , and Frederick I , " The Great , " ( 1740-1786 ) . When the Great Elector came to the throne , he withdrew from the Thirty Years ' War long enough to organize a strong army , and re-entered the war before its close in time to have a voice in the peace and a share of the territorial loot . By changing sides in the Swedish-Polish war that broke out in 1655 , Frederick William obtained East Prussia from Poland . In return for . Ming the emperor Leopold in the War of the Spanish Succession , the Hohenzollerns were raised to the dignity of the kingship . The eccentric Frederick William I , father of Frederick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the army , in fostering the growth of trade , industry , and agriculture , and in waking Prussia strong . He deplored his son 's taste for music , literature , and French culture , which was dominant in Europe in the eighteenth century as well as in the seventeenth , and publicly caned .1 lid humiliated the boy until he planned to run away from the Prussian court with a young friend . Discovering the plot , the king had Frederick 's friend beheaded outside his son 's window , and put Frederick to work as a clerk in the Chamber of War and Domains . When Frederick succeeded to the throne in 1740 , he dismissed the useless regiment of giants , many of them over seven feet tall , that had been his father 's pride . He increased the army and built up spplies and munitions . Frederick did not have to wait long for an xcuse to make use of his powerful army . In 1740 the emperor Charles VI died . Charles had no son , but for many years he had exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe in return for their agreement that they would recognize and support the right of his daughter Maria Theresa to inherit his domains . These treaties were known collectively as the Pragmatic Sanction . But Frederick 's funeral was scarcely over before the European states asserted claims to parts of , Maria Theresa 's inheritance . Frederick II was the first to take decisive action . Without declaring war , he marched his army into Silesia . Austria was totally nprepared . France , Spain , Sweden , Bavaria , and Saxony entered the war in the hope of making territorial gains . England , prompted by- her bitter colonial rivalry with France , sided with Austria . Maria heresa appealed directly to her subjects who rallied to her cause . Frederick , who had withd. ? RWn from the war , had to re-enter it as p 300 Austrian successes endangered his hold on Silesia . When peace was finally arranged in 1748 , Frederick held Silesia although all other conquests of territory were restored . During the eight years following the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle , a realignment of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " Diplomatic Revolution . " Alarmed by the power of Prussia , France , Austria , Russia , Sweden , and Saxony formed an alliance against Frederick , while England abandoned Austria and switched her support to Frederick . The colonial consequences of the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 ? 1763 ) have been discussed . Hostilities had already begun between England and France in India in 1751 and in America in 1754 . On the continent Frederick commenced hostilities by attacking Saxony . Despite a series of brilliant military victories which won for Frederick his title , " The Great , " the weight of the coalition made itself felt . Beginning with the defeat of Kunersdorf in 1759 , then followed such a series of disasters that Frederick contemplated suicide . Frederick was saved from complete defeat by the death of the , Czarina Elizabeth in 1762 which brought to the Russian throne the half-German Peter III . Peter immediately concluded peace with Frederick , and sent him Russian troops to aid him against Russia 's former allies . Frederick gained no territory from the Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussian armies and their leader established Prussian military prestige . And , as we saw , in 1772 , in collaboration with Catherine of Russia and Maria Theresa of Austria , he added West Prussia to the Hohenzollern domain . AUSTRIA AND JOSEPH II The reign of Maria Theresa has been discussed to some degree in connection with those of Catherine and Frederick . She was a very different type of person from her collaborators in the Polish partition . Although an autocrat in her government , she lacked the calculating hardness of Catherine and Frederick . At least the partition of Poland made her weep . And she was realistic enough to know that if she had refused to take part , Poland would have been partitioned anyway . Joseph II succeeded his father as emperor in 1765 . Upon the death of his mother , Maria Theresa , in 178o , Joseph inaugurated  | series of reforms more sweeping than anything that had thus far hen envisaged in Europe . Joseph sought to centralize the administration and to unify the language of his polyglot empire . German was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This offended all the non-German elements in the empire : Magyars , Czechs , Poles and Croats . Another desire of Joseph was to establish equality before the law for all citizens . All offenders whether noble or peasant , Christian or non-Christian , were to be treated equally under the law . The death penalty and extreme punishments were abolished . This offended : luny nobles and Christians . In 1781 Joseph abolished serfdom , which permitted peasants to liange their homes , marry at will , own land . The freed peasants were put under the protection of the state against the attempts of their lords to fine or punish them . An edict of Toleration granted religious rights to Protestants and the Greek Orthodox Catholics , red most of the disabilities of the Jews were abolished . Joseph also sought to reform and nationalize the Catholic Church . , long somewhat the lines that had been in France .

A peasant rebellion broke out . All classes and all groups in Joseph 's domains resented his Forts and resisted them . He was forced to rescind most of his decrees ! Ii January 1 790 . He died the next month . The reaction to Joseph 's reforms helps us to understand why Catherine was content to do so I the to change conditions in Russia .  | The Era of Revolution THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION THIS is not the place for a narrative of the causes and events of the American Revolution ; that will be dealt with in another chapter . What concerns us here is the European aspect of that event . For the American founding fathers were Europeans in culture and background , and were fully in touch with the philosophical and t reforming ideas and ideals of eighteenth century Europe . THE FRENCH REVOLUTION The change in thought which laid the foundation for the overthrow of the political and social institutions of feudalism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? who were supported and encouraged by the members of the privileged classes , the nobility and higher clergy , and the wealthy and cultured bourgeoisie . It is difficult , in a brief space , to give any satisfactory account of the change of outlook effected . To the Middle Ages , men were by nature imperfect beings , heirs to sin and error , who could only be saved through God 's mercy ; for even if a man 's intentions were of the purest , and he succeeded in resisting or avoiding temptation , his imperfect judgment might still lead him astray . By the eighteenth century , many were asserting that men are fundamentally good by nature , and that they have become corrupted by institutions . Voltaire imagined the Huron Indian as an unspoiled " natural " man , and in this way tried to show what men would be like if they could free themselves of the past . Throughout most of his career Voltaire attacked the church as one  | of the evil institutions to be gotten rid of . Rousseau proclaimed that teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . This philosophical revolt against the past suited well with the popular mood for many reasons . The extravagances and wars of Louis XIV and Louis XV had put the French nation hopelessly in debt . The privileged classes expensively adorned Versailles , but Nerved no useful purpose while the bourgeoisie , i.e. , the prosperous , town-dwelling , merchant and professional men , who had contributed to the material prosperity of France , were denied privileges and social status merely by reason of birth . Taxes fell upon those who were denied privileges . When in 1789 King Louis XVI summoned an Estates General to meet at Versailles in order to levy such taxes as would extricate the government from its financial predicament , the representatives brought to the meeting cahiers , or written memoranda , of the abuses the people of the nation wished to see corrected . Failing to overawe or cajole the members of the Third Estate into passively voting money , Louis tried to dissolve the session , but was defied by Count Mirabeau , a champion of the popular cause . On June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Assembly , and invited representatives of the other estates to join them . Finally accepted by the king as representing the nation , the group reformed itself as the National Constituent Assembly and appointed a committee to frame a new constitution . Alarmed by the presence of bodies of troops that had assembled to maintain order , the people of Paris armed themselves and stormed the old prison of the Bastille on July 14th . The continued uneasiness of the people of Paris led to an outbreak in October when a band marched to Versailles and brought the king to Paris . He was shortly followed by the Assembly . The representatives were encouraged to reform their government I , v the success of the revolutionary movement in England which cullininated in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the rise to power if the men of enterprise and property and an era of commercial and industrial prosperity , and by the American Revolution . The constitution of the new American nation , which was adopted in 1789 , the ear of the French Revolution , stirred profoundly the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise provisions for self-government . The new French constitution of 1791  | contained a declaration of the rights of man which asserted all my to be free and equal in rights ; assured freedom of consciences speech , and press ; decreed the right of men to possess property . The sovereignty of the people and the separation of governmental powers were principles embodied in the constitution . The monarchy w retained , but the king became a limited and constitutional ruler . The financial difficulties were met by seizing and making public the property of the church . On September 14th King Louis accepted the constitution . In August 1791 the Emperor Leopold and the king of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz which stated that they were willing to intervene to restore Louis to his old position , but only with the consent of all the European powers , including England . Alarmed by the threat of intervention , the more radical members of the newly elected Legislative Assembly , the Girondins , aided by the still more radical Jacobin clubs , whipped up a patriotic fervor throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put three armies in the field . News of French reverses caused intense excitement in Paris . Ever since the first revolutionary succession in 1789 Marat , through his journal , the Ami du Peuple ? the Friend of the People ? had urged the Paris populace to take matters into their own hands for he feared that the wealthy bourgeoisie might get j control and set up an aristocratic regime similar to that which held sway in England . The fearful mob , lashed by Marat 's frenzied articles and by their own speakers , attacked the Tuileries palace o August Io and the king was forced to seek refuge with the Assembly The king was imprisoned in the old house of the Knights Tern plars and a provisional government was set up in which Danton was the dominant figure . In September , the frenzied mob broke into the prisons and slaughtered thousands of political prisoners . Similar slaughters took place at Versailles , Lyons , Orleans , and Rheims . The national government fell under the domination of the Paris mob . In late September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention . The monarchy was abolished and France was declared a republic . Aroused by Danton 's oratory , the people seized weapons and rushed to the defense of the nation . The tide of war turned in favor of the French . In November the Convention offered French assistance all peoples who wished to overthrow their  | governments . The government was puzzled as to what to do with it e king , since it was agreed it was not safe to set him free . He was brought to trial , condemned , and beheaded by the guillotine on Janruary 21 , 1793 . The execution of the king shocked Europe and the war spread . Fresh French reverses brought the radical Jacobins to the fore , and more moderate members were suspected of treason . Unable to t , Ierate criticism , the radical Jacobins under Robespierre , instituted reign of terror during which the most appalling wholesale slaughters took place of all those even vaguely suspected of being critical ul the Jacobin rule . The Reign of Terror began in September 1793 , and lasted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French armies and the end of the Reign of Terror restored a degree of calm . In August 1795 , a new government was established which placed the executive power in a directory of five , iimd the legislative function in the hands of two chambers , a Council fil Elders and a Council of Five Hundred . Shortly after its establishment a royalist insurrection broke out in Paris , and on the motion Barras , General Bonaparte , then in Paris without a commission , was put in charge of the troops . His famous " whiff of grapeshot " from the Church of St. Roche broke the uprising . Napoleon NAPOLEON 'S SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE of the government won him He command of the Army of the Interior . The Directory arranged for a triple attack upon the empire . An army under Jourdan was to advance into the region of the lower Rhine , another under Moreau as to penetrate the upper Rhineland , and a third army under  | Napoleon was to clear northern Italy of the Austrians , and advance through the Tyrol to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in Germany , and a truce was about to be concluded when the archduke Charles suddenly took the offensive , defeated Jourdan , and drove Moreau back to the upper Rhine . Before leaving Paris for Italy , Napoleon married Josephine Beauharnais , one of the most popular figures in Paris society . He led his army into Italy along the coast and defeated both the Austrians and Piedmontese . Piedmont ceded Savoy and Nice to France , made peace , and permitted the French to garrison Piedmontese fortresses . Napoleon then pursued the Austrians whom he defeated again at the battle of Lodi on May 1o . He entered Milan on May 15 , subjugated Lombardy , and set up the Lombard Republic . The pope , the king of Naples , and the dukes of Modena and Parma bought peace by surrendering large sums of money and many art treasures ; and Napoleon rapidly advanced across northern Italy , and won a series of victories against the enemy . Threatened again , the pope surrendered Romagna , Bologna , and Ferrara . During March and April 1797 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uprising of Venice and the Tyrol against the French forced him to conclude the preliminary peace of Leoben on April 18 . The territorial settlement gave France the Belgian provinces , and recognized the Cisalpine Republic which was to be formed in northern Italy . Without waiting to fulfill the other provisions of the treaty , France attacked Venice and overthrew the aristocratic government . The Republic of Genoa was transformed into the Ligurian Republic under French control . The treaty of Campo Formio confirmed many of the provisions of Leoben , and ceded further territories to France , including the left bank of the Rhine . In February 1798 the French occupied Rome , took Pope Pius VI prisoner , and set up the Roman Republic . THE EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN Pretending to be preparing an invasion of England , Napoleon gathered an army of 35,000 , and suddenly sailed for Egypt where he landed July 1 , and took Alexandria the following day . The Egyptian army was defeated in the battle of the Pyramids on July 21 . But the British admiral , Nelson , located and destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus cut Napoleon off from France . Al- though he invaded Syria , and defeated Turkish and British forces there , Napoleon 's army was decimated by losses and the outbreak of the plague , and he beat a hasty retreat into Egypt . Napoleon 's reports of brilliant victories and his suppression of the less favorable aspects of his Egyptian campaign made him a popular hero in France , for during his absence French armies in Germany and Italy were suffering defeat . He abandoned his Egyptian army , and unexpectedly returned to France in August 1799 . With the help of his brother Lucien , Napoleon overthrew the now unpopular Directory and formed a new government . THE CONSULATE The new Constitution of the Year VIII of the Republic made Napoleon first Consul in association with two other consuls whose functions were however merely advisory . Although the new constitution preserved the appearance of a republic through the institution of elected legislative bodies , it actually established the dictatorship of Napoleon . France was divided into prefectures and sub-prefectures , and new and efficient systems of administration and tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers of peace , the war was resumed . The First Consul led an army into Italy while Moreau advanced into Germany . A. series of brilliant French victories in both fields of warfare led to the Treaty of Luneville in February 1801 which confirmed former cessions to France , recognized the satellite Batavian ( Dutch ) , Helvetian ( Swiss ) , Cisalpine ( north Italian ) , and Ligurian ( Genoese ) , republics . The grand duchy of Tuscany was transformed into the Kingdom of Etruria , and Spain ceded Louisiana to France , which sold it to the United States in 1803 . A treaty was concluded with Naples , a Concordat was arranged with the pope , and finally in March 18o2 peace was arranged with England . Europe was at peace . THE EMPIRE In May 1804 Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor of the French ; he was consecrated by the pope in Paris the following December . In imitation of Pepin and Charlemagne , he placed the crown on his own head .

All Luther sought after at the moment was the correction of obvious abuses . But Albert 's financial interests were involved , and he attempted to suppress his lively and popular critic . The grounds of the controversy were quickly shifted from the indulgence question to the question of whether Luther , whose stand had provoked widespread hostility to the clergy , was a rebellious churchman unwilling to submit to the authority of his superiors . Sure of the rightness of his original stand , Luther was led to insist that he would not submit against the dictates of his conscience . If these were denied by cc- ( lesiastical authority ? even the authority of the pope or of a council ? Luther declared he would make his appeal to Scripture . Before lie realized what had happened to him , Luther found himself defending the teachings of the heretic , John Hus . SPREAD OF THE LUTHERAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible it might have been restricted to church and university circles . But about the middle of the fifteenth century the printing press had been invented , and its use had spread widely . Luther , who was an able pamphleteer , flooded Germany with articles attacking every sort of abuse . In his Address to the Nobility of the German Nation , Luther ailed upon the Germans to unite and destroy the power of the pope over the German states . This led to a war of the lesser German knights against the greater lay and ecclesiastical princes who were allied by interest with foreign powers . The peasants were stirred up to demand the abandonment of many feudal practices which seriously interfered with their well-being . A bloody revolt followed . Luther was horrified by some of the consequences of his agitation . Many of the German nobles abandoned the church and adopted Lutheranism . As they promptly confiscated the lands and property of the church , it is evident that their motives were not purely religious . The split-up of Germany into hostile camps of Protestant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled the reign of the emperor Charles V as we shall have oc sion to recall later on . ZWINGLI Independent of Luther a reform movement had begun in Swi erland . Its founder was Ulrich Zwingli , a humanist priest , who w appointed vicar at the Cathedral of Zurich in 1518 . Zwingli s established himself among the prosperous citizens of Zurich . was a keen critic of abuses in the church . In 1519 he forced a sell of indulgences to leave Zurich . He was strongly opposed to t practice of the young Swiss hiring themselves out all over Europe mercenary soldiers , and strongly criticized the papacy as one of t chief employers of Swiss mercenary troops . Zwingli followed wi close attention the progress of the Lutheran movement in German In 1532 Zwingli drew up a list of sixty-seven theses containing statement of his essential position . He went beyond Luther in his r jection of customary ideas and practices , for not only did Zwing condemn the papacy , priesthood , and monasticism ; he also abol. ished the mass , statues , crucifixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of similarity between Luther 's and Zwingli ' positions resulted in an attempt to bring them into agreement . Th two reformers met but were unable to agree on a number of point The spread of Zwingli 's doctrines to all but the five forest canto of Switzerland resulted in the formation of two hostile leagu which prepared for war . In 1531 the Protestant forces were de feated , and Zwingli was killed . The forest cantons remained stanchly Catholic . JOHN CALVIN The work of Zwingli was taken up some time later by Joh Calvin , a Frenchman . John Calvin , whose father was employed i the service of the Catholic church , was like Luther educated for th law . He became much interested in the religious controversies of his ' day , and upon his father 's death went into retirement in order to clarify his ideas . In 1534 he severed his connection with the Catholic church and traveled to Switzerland . In 1536 Calvin published The Institutes of the Christian Religion . which contained the essentials of his belief . The work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French translation was dedicated to Francis I , king France , in an effort to win sympathy for the new ideas . The French king remained a loyal Catholic however , and in 1542 Call 's book was condemned as heretical . GENEVA UNDER CALVINISM The reforming zeal of Calvin , like that of Zwingli whose work he ) k up , led him to condemn all outward display connected with reion . The stained glass windows of the Swiss churches were lashed , altars and statues and crucifixes were removed , wall fres. s were whitewashed over . This attitude soon affected the social c of Geneva where Calvin established himself . Calvin went beyond Zwingli and developed the idea of predesnation . In contemplating the sinfulness of man and the omniscence of God , Calvin was forced to recognize that since God was ) le to foresee all the future he must in some way have known and ' cc ? epted in advance the fact that most men would lead sinful lives . Calvin concluded that the number of men who were destined to be saved was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were in advance . How then might the individual know whether he was numbered among the elect or whether he was destined to be damned ? The only sure sign of God 's grace or election was the righteousness of the life of the individual . Under Calvin 's leadership , Geneva developed into a theocratic or religious state . The conduct of the citizens was regulated in the smallest details . Dancing , card-playing , careless language , vain dress , were strictly forbidden , and the severest punishments were dieted out for the violation of such rules . During his lifetime Calvin maintained a large correspondence ' v ith converts all over Europe . His religion was spread as much by I is writings as by his preaching in Geneva , which was listened to Iiv the many who visited the city . Calvinism spread to Scotland and England , to the Netherlands , into Germany , and later into Bohemia and Hungary with important consequences which we shall have casion to deal with .   DURING the course of the Hundred Years ' War the nobles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ian . was in the hands of the great feudal families like the Percy Nevilles , Beauforts and Mortimers . They supported armies of hire . retainers , and settled their differences with each other by engaging in private wars as in early feudal times . The ruling house of Lancaster was in general disfavor because of the failure of English arms and the loss of continental possessions to France . In addition Henry VI ( 1422 ? 1461 ) was a weak king and subject to fits of insanity . The dukes of York , descended from a son of Edward III , had a strong claim to the throne . Supported by the earl of Warwick , who became known as the " King-maker , " the Yorkist Edward overthrew Henry and became king in his place al Edward IV . Edward IV disregarded the wishes of Warwick in choosing a wife and quarreled with his powerful backer . Warwick changed sides and re-established Henry on the throne for a brief time . However , Edward recovered the throne , Warwick was killed in battle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of Edward 's reign was quiet , but when he died in 1483 leaving a twelve-year-old son to succeed him , his brother , Richard , duke of Gloucester , became protector of England . The ambitious noble confined his two young nephews in the Tower of London , and had himpelf proclaimed king as Richard III . The murder of the little princes in the Tower shocked England , and many rallied to the support of the Lancastrian heir , Henry Tudor , who came over from France with an army . At Bosworth field in 1485 , Richard was defeated and slain . P 243 These struggles , known as the Wars of the Roses from the insignia of the rival houses of York and Lancaster , were fought by the nobles and their hired armies . Fearing to arouse the country against aim , each side was careful to do as little damage to the countryside possible , with the result that the economic life of England suferred little . Nevertheless , the bulk of the English people were hearty sick of the nobles and their political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened the rsition of the Tudor monarchs . The fact that many nobles had . en killed during the course of the wars enabled Henry to create stew nobles whose loyalty he could depend upon . Henry Tudor , a Lancastrian , married the heiress of the Yorkist house , thus putting in end to the rivalry of the two families . The Tudors were absolute monarchs but they were popular rulrs . They treated parliament with respect but depended upon it as little as possible . Henry VII surrounded himself with bourgeois advisers and devoted his reign to strengthening the monarchy and fostering the prosperity of England . He well knew that in a crisis the monarchy would be dependent upon parliament for grants of money and new taxes , so during the course of his reign he accumu , lated a treasure which he passed on to his son . HENRY VIII Henry VIII ( 1509 ? 1547 ) began his reign under most favorable auspices . He was a handsome and amiable young man of eighteen nd popular with his people . The courtiers were submissive , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave promise of an era of prosperity to come . He was unusually talented , well educated , and was surrounded and counseled by able and experienced men . Henry quickly appreciated the abilities of a young churchman of middle-class origin , Thomas Wolsey , who had been chaplain at the curt of Henry VII . Under the king 's patronage Wolsey 's rise was rapid . He became chancellor and cardinal in the same year , 1515 , thus holding the highest offices in both church and state that any subject could hold in England . Henry was happy to be relieved of the cares of government by so able a man . Wolsey adopted a continental policy that has become famous in English history . England was much inferior in population and wealth to the two strongest  | continental states ? Spain and France . By holding aloof from alli. ; ances with either of the great rivals , Wolsey placed England in a position whereby she could determine the balance of power between them , and thus her favor was sought by both sides . HENRY VIII AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther 's conduct , he published a Defense of the Seven Sacraments against Martin Luther in which he met Luther 's attack point by point . Pope Leo X was so pleased with Henry 's treatise that he bestowed upon him the title " Defender of the Faith . " Henry was married to Catherine of Aragon , daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain . During fifteen years of married lily ' Catherine bore Henry six children , all of whom died in infancy except one , Mary . Since the Norman conquest only one woman , Matilda , had claimed inheritance of the English throne , thus starting a civil war which lasted fifteen years . Henry wanted a son . He came to the conclusion that his marriage was accursed for he had married his brother 's widow , a relationship forbidden by the church . Since the queen was past childbearing , Henry insisted that Wolsey get him a divorce in order that he might remarry and beget a son . Wolsey 's assignment was extremely difficult . The Catholic church did not recognize divorces . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical reasons , but before Henry 's marriage to Catherine the precaution had been taken of obtaining a special dispensation from the pope sanctioning the marriage . Its addition , Catherine was the aunt of the powerful Emperor Charicr V who was also king of Spain . Charles was certain to do everything in his power to protect his aunt 's name and interests . Wolsey 's failure earned him disgrace . He was deprived of office and ordered to retire to his bishopric . Death saved him from further penalties . The new archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Cranmer , convoked the ecclesiastical court , which , after long consideration , declared that Henry and Catherine were never properly married . Meanwhile Henry had secretly married Anne Boleyn who shortly gave birth to a daughter , Elizabeth , in September 1533 . Parliament , by the Act of Succession , obligingly legalized what had taken place . In answer to the opposition of Rome , Henry next repudiated papal authority entirely . Parliament passed in 1534 the Act of Supremacy p 245 which severed the English church from Rome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of England . In 1536 Queen Anne was accused of adultery , condemned , and reheaded , and a short time later Henry married Jane Seymour who nave birth to a son , Edward . A few weeks after the birth of the prince , Jane died . Henry now made a political marriage . To counterbalance the Franco-Spanish alliance , he prepared to ally himself with the Protestant princes of Germany by marrying Anne of Cleves . Cromwell had arranged the match , and had submitted a flattering portrait of Anne by the great painter Holbein . But Henry was so repelled by his first sight of the bride-to-be , " the great Flanders mare " Ile called her , that he could scarcely be persuaded to go through with the ceremony . Cromwell was arrested for treason and executed in 1542 . Let us complete the list of Henry 's wives by recalling that he next married the beautiful Catherine Howard who , fifteen months after her marriage , was condemned for immoral conduct and beheaded .

He dissipated the treasure he had inherited from his father . When England separated from Rome , Henry suppressed the monasteries and confiscated their property . This wealth too he used up . Toward the close of his reign he obtained money by debasing the coinage . This reduction of the percentage of gold and silver in the coins lowered the value of money and caused prices to fluctuate , and commerce suffered . Before his death Henry arranged for the succession by making a will . His son Edward , a sickly youth , was first in line of succession . But in the event that Edward should not survive to leave an heir , the succession was to pass to Henry 's oldest daughter , Mary , daughter of Catherine of Aragon . In the event of Mary 's death , Elizabeth , ( laughter of Anne Boleyn , was to be next in line . THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . Art , letters , and music flourished . Despite the roubled reigns of Edward VI and Mary , they continued to a high  | flowering under Elizabeth . The lusty vigor of English life under the Tudors is recalled for us by the extravagant richness of costume which we notice in the portraits by Hans Holbein who painted at the English court , in the daring adventures of Elizabethan freebooters , and above all in the magnificent productions of the dramatists of the period whose crowning genius was William Shakespeare . After Henry 's death the course of English history was much affected by developments on the continent of Europe and elsewhere . It will be convenient therefore to view the reigns of the later Tudors from the broader perspective of European and world-with developments .  | THE EMPIRE OF CHARLES V ALBERT OF MAINZ had foreseen that upon the death of the emperor Maximilian there would be a lively contest over the imperial succession . Three powerful and wealthy monarchs competed in bribing the seven electors of the Holy Roman Empire . It is claimed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with his best judgment and his conscience , was Frederick , the elector of Saxony . The three candidates were Henry VIII of England , Francis I of France , and Charles I of Spain . In the end it was Charles I of Spain , grandson of Maximilian who was raised to the imperial office as the Emperor Charles V. Charles , who was a Hapsburg , became the greatest ruler in Europe . The Hapsburg family , from very humble beginnings had , by shrewd policy and the patient enlargement of their holdings , risen to the position of first place . This rise began with Count Rudolph in the thirteenth century who , elected emperor in 1273 , took advantage of his position to obtain as a personal fief the duchy of Austria . By a series of shrewd marriages the family held its position and increased its possessions . For a while the house of Luxembourg replaced the Hapsburgs on the imperial throne , but in 1440 the Hapsburgs were restored . They continued to rule the empire until it was dissolved in 1806 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War I. Maximilian I ( 1493 ? 1518 ) married Mary of Burgundy who brought him Franche-Comte , Luxembourg , Flanders , Artois , and the Netherlands . These possessions were passed on to Charles upon the death of his father in 1506 . Charles ' father , Philip , had married Juana , daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella , the Spanish rulers . In  | 1516 the Spanish inheritance passed to Charles . This brought under his control not only Spain itself and the Spanish islands of the Mediterranean ; also the Spanish possessions in Italy and the vast and growing American empire . A mere listing of all of Charles ' titles and territories would require pages . THE MANY PROBLEMS OF CHARLES V Having been elected emperor , Charles desired nothing so much as to be left alone to establish his administration , to become familiar with his new subjects , and to free himself from his heavy debt to the Hugger bankers who had raised the funds with which he had bought his election . We have already noted the growing nationalism of the peoples of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire jealous of the other . Spain had only recently been united by Ferdinand and Isabella . I t was not until 1492 that these rulers drove out the last of the Moslems from Granada where they had been in control since 71 I. All during the Middle Ages that part of Spain which was not tinder Moslem control had been made up of small principalities tv hich were almost constantly at war . Charles , who was raised in Flanders , offended his Spanish subjects by appointing Flemings to hosts in the Spanish government . When he sought the imperial crown , the Spaniards revolted , fearing Spain would become subordinated to the German empire . THE SITUATION IN FRANCE Francis I , who had lost the imperial election , found his nation , France , surrounded by Hapsburg lands . A glance at the map will help us to understand why Francis felt that the security of France was menaced by Hapsburg power . To the north and east were the Netherlands , Flanders , Luxembourg , Franche-Comte . Across the Alps and to the south and southwest lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Corsica , the Balearics , and of course Spain itself . And to the north , across the Channel , lay England whose king was married to Catherine of Aragon , daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella . King Francis I adopted a policy which was pursued by his successors for some time to come . That policy was to keep the monarchy strong inside France , and to use every opportunity to break  | the power of the great Hapsburg empire which surrounded France on three sides . He immediately laid claim to the Italian possessions of the Hapsburgs and attacked the duchy of Milan . The harassed Charles , with unsolved problems awaiting him in Spain and Germany while the Ottoman Turks threatened his empire on the continent and in the Mediterranean , was forced to gather troops and defend his possessions . In 1525 the French were overwhelmingly defeated in northern Italy and Francis was taken prisoner . The Fugger bankers , already heavily invested in Charles ' empire , were slow to provide Charles with the money he needed to pay his troops . In 1527 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an eight-day sack . The pope took refuge in the impregnable castle of Saint Angelo which was originally the tomb of the Roman emperor Hadrian . Despite his defeat Francis persisted in his effort to break the Hapsburg power . He made alliances with Denmark , Sweden , with the German princes who opposed the emperor , and even with the Moslem Turk . In 1535 Francesco Sforza , duke of Milan , died and Francis claimed the ducal throne for his son . This started another war which lasted until 1544 . THE TURKS In 1520 the sultan , Selim the Grim ( 1512-1520 ) , was succeeded by Suleiman the Magnificent ( 1520-1566 ) , under whom the Turkish empire reached the zenith of its power . After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Turks had consolidated their control of the Balkans and had extended their conquests elsewhere . In 1521 Suleiman captured Belgrade , a fortress which had checked the Turkish advance into Hungary . In the following year the island of Rhodes , stronghold of the knights of St. John , was taken and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mohacs in 1526 , the Hungarian army was routed by the Turks and King Louis II was drowned while fleeing from battle . Thus the bulk of Hungary fell into Turkish hands . Archduke Ferdinand of Austria , who was the brother of the Emperor Charles V , claimed the throne of Hungary . Invading the country , he took Bucharest . Suleiman then invaded Austria and laid siege to Vienna . The Austrians fought so valiantly that Suleiman was forced to raise the siege , but he returned to the task three year : water with a great army .  | As ruler of the Germans , as a Hapsburg , and as emperor and therefore the secular leader of western Christendom , Charles was obliged to protect Christian Europe from the Turkish menace . It mattered not that the king of France was his bitter enemy , that the German Protestant princes had formed a league against him , that the English king had cast off his wife , Charles ' aunt , and severed England from the church of Rome . Charles raised an army and Suleiman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next planned to clear the Moslems from the Mediterranean for , not only did Christian shipping suffer at the hands of the Moslem raiders based in north Africa , the coasts of southern Europe were raided and along with plunder the Saracens carried off youths and maidens to be sold in eastern slave markets and confined in eastern harems . In the summer of 1535 Charles destroyed a Moorish fleet and seized the Moslem stronghold of Tunis in north Africa . Here he found and released from the filthy and overcrowded Moslem prisons some twenty-two thousand Christians . He was forced to abandon his purpose of clearing the Mediterranean when Francis I of France invaded the duchy of Milan . GERMANY IN RELATION TO CHARLES V When Charles I , Hapsburg king of Spain , was elected emperor as Charles V , the Germans at once became fearful lest German interests be subordinated to Spanish interests by the emperor . They presented a set of conditions to Charles which he accepted , but this by no means allayed German fears . We saw that Luther 's attacks upon the Roman church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German nobles took advantage of the spread of Lutheranism to seize church lands and incorporate them into their own estates . It naturally became the concern of the emperor to end the troubles among his German subjects , to bring about a settlement of the Lutheran controversy , to protect the church and princes from being despoiled of their lands , and to maintain order and peace . A series of synods and diets , over some of which the emperor presided , failed to bring about a conciliation between Lutherans and Catholics . In 1531 the German Protestant princes banded together in an association known as the Schmalkaldic League which soon became involved in a war against the emperor .  | The year 1547 was a happy one for Charles V. In that year both Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England died , a five-year truce was signed with the sultan , and the opposition of the Schmalkaldic League was broken at the battle of Muhlberg . Within three years however Charles was faced by as many difficulties as ever . His wise attempt to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the religious dispute was resisted by Protestant and Catholic , Maurice of Saxony led a rebellion against the emperor which was kept alive by the French after Maurice 's death in 1553 . Worn out by the cares of a long reign , Charles arranged for a division of the far-flung Hapsburg empire between his son Philip and his brother Ferdinand . In 1555 he surrendered the Netherlands to Philip . In 1556 he resigned the empire to his brother Ferdinand who was already ruling in his name . In 1558 he died quietly in retirement in Spain . PHILIP II AND ENGLAND While Charles had been raised in Flanders and appeared a foreigner in the eyes of his Spanish subjects , Philip , who had been raised and educated in Spain , seemed a foreigner to the Netherlanders for he did not even speak their language . During Charles ' reign the Netherlands had remained loyal to their Hapsburg ruler , but under Philip there developed in the lowlands a strong nationalist sentiment . In 1543 , at the age of sixteen , Philip was married to his cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Don Carlos . Charles then arranged a second marriage for his son to Mary Tudor , daughter of Henry VIII . This marriage was a failure from the start for Philip was unpopular in England . During the brief reign of the frail Edward VI ( 1547 ? 1553 ) his uncle Edward Seymour , earl of Hertford and duke of Somerset , became virtual dictator of England as Lord Protector . He was head of the Protestant party , and with the aid of Archbishop Cranmer succeeded in introducing Protestant reforms in the English church . Even though he had broken with Rome , Henry VIII continued to regard himself as a Catholic . He insisted upon maintaining the Catholic dogmas and service and persecuted the Protestants . But by the time Mary came to the throne in 1553 Protestantism had been well advanced in England , for the duke of Northumberland . successor to Somerset , also strongly favored Protestantism .  | When Mary came to the throne in 1553 , Parliament obligingly repealed the reforms of Edward 's reign , discarded Cranmer 's Book of Common Prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin service of the Catholic church . These changes the English 1 night have accepted calmly , but they were averse to recognizing papal supremacy . Mary secured the repeal of the anti-papal legislation of Henry VIII , received Cardinal Pole , the papal legate , and proceeded to persecute those Englishmen who refused to accept Catholicism . Philip was wrongly blamed by the English for many of Mary 's unpopular acts . Englishmen called to him in the streets to hurry up and beget an heir and then take himself off to Spain . Philip left England in the autumn of 1555 . However he returned in 1557 to seek England 's aid in his war against France . In spite of popular opposition Mary joined the war with disastrous results , for in 1558 the French took Calais , the last remnant of the once extensive English dominion in France . The childless Mary died in November 1558 , and the ties between England and Spain were severed . THE PROBLEMS OF PHILIP II During the first two years of his reign Philip was engaged in a war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France were concerned over the spread of Protestantism . In 1559 , in the treaty of Cateau-Cambresis the two monarchs arranged a peace which left them free to suppress the spread of heresy in their respective domains . Many problems demanded Philip 's attention . Charles had not found time to devise a centralized administration for Spain , each of whose many provinces owed him separate allegiance and existed under a separate administration . The Turk was still a menace to Europe both upon land and in the Mediterranean . An administrative problem also confronted Philip in the Netherlands for some sort of unification and centralization was necessary if the seventeen provinces were to be administered efficiently . In addition , Philip regarded himself as the champion and protector of Catholicism all over Europe . This involved him in efforts to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands , to root out heresy among the newly converted Moors and Jews in southern Spain which had been conquered by Ferdinand and Isabella . It was also necessary to foster the development of the great Spanish empire in America and to protect Spanish  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . PHILIP AND THE TURKS In 1570 the pope , Venice , and Spain ; formed a league against the Turk . A fleet of 264 vessels was brought together and placed under the command of Philip 's half-brother , Don Jon of Austria . On October 7 , 1571 the fleet met the formidable Turkish force of 300 vessels at Lepanto in the Gulf of Corinth . The overwhelming victory of the Christian fleet was hailed with jubilation throughout Europe . Don Jon now proposed to seize the Turkish strongholds in the East and free the Mediterranean from Moslem control once and for all , but Venice withdrew her support and proceeded to make a separate treaty and a commercial agreement with the Turks . In Spain the Moriscos , the Moslems who had been converted to Christianity after the conquest of Granada by Ferdinand and Isabella , were accused of practicing in secret the faith which they had outwardly abandoned . The Inquisition , which had been introduced into Spain under Ferdinand and Isabella and flourished under the famous , or infamous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed once again to ferret out heresy . Its activities provoked a rebellion which broke out in 1569 , and was put down only after much bloodshed . THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS When Philip tried to reform and consolidate the administration of the Netherlands , the Dutch provinces , traditionally jealous of their independence , resisted his efforts . As was natural , Philip employed a good many Spaniards in his administration . Unfortunately they showed little regard for the feelings of Philip 's Dutch subjects . When the nobles presented a petition to Philip 's regent , Margaret of Parma , a Spanish official contemptuously referred to them as beggars . The Dutch promptly adopted the name and medieval insignia of the beggar . Before Philip could act upon the petition of his Netherlands subjects , an anti-Catholic riot broke out , led principally by the radical Anabaptist sect which favored the overthrow of government as well as church . Great damage was done to Christian churches . Philip decided that it was too late for conciliatory measures . He  | dispatched the duke of Alva to the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rebels were condemned to death after summary trial , and their property was confiscated . Alva succeeded in embittering the Dutch beyond any hope of reconciliation . William , prince of Orange , assumed the leadership of the rebels and a prolonged struggle was begun . The ablest of Alva 's successors , Alexander Farnese , was successful in bringing about a division between the Catholic south and the Protestant north of the Netherlands , but it was the most he could achieve . The seven Protestant provinces bound themselves together in a league called the Union of Utrecht in 1581 and renounced their allegiance to the king of Spain . This Union of Utrecht is sometimes called the Dutch Declaration of Independence . PHILIP AND ENGLAND One of Philip 's problems was the development and the protection of his American empire . These colonies continued to produce many commodities that were in demand in Europe . But around 1535 there began to arrive in Spain shipments of gold and silver from Mexico and Peru . Enormous as this wealth was , it quickly passed out of Spanish hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and costly enterprises : war with France and with the Turk , rebellion in the Netherlands , in Italy ; in Germany , and finally war against England . It is interesting to observe that the precious metals , brought from America and quickly distributed over Europe through the hiring of troops , and the purchase of supplies , contributed substantially to European prosperity by providing the material for new money when new money was needed for the convenience of expanding economic activity . In 158o Philip seized an opportunity to extend enormously the Spanish empire and to unite the Iberian Peninsula . In 158o the throne of Portugal became vacant upon the death of King Henry without heirs . Philip , whose mother was the eldest daughter of King Manuel and whose wife was a Portuguese princess , claimed the throne . Portugal with its great eastern , African , and American empire ? for the Portuguese had discovered and developed Brazil ? remained under Spanish rule from 158o to 164o . Although the pope had divided the non-Christian world between Spain and Portugal , awarding to Portugal Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil , the other European states refused to pay serious attention to the agreement . The English , like the Spanish and Portuguese before them , sought to discover a route to the East . During Mary 's reign Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor sailed in search of a northeast passage around Europe to China and the Indies . Chancellor entered the White Sea and was taken to Moscow where he arranged a trade treaty with Ivan the Terrible . In 1554 Queen Mary chartered the Muscovy Company to handle the trade with Russia . Later John Davis made three attempts to find a northwest passage around North America to the East between 1585 and 1587 . In the meantime English adventurers sought to break the Spanish and Portuguese monopolies over trade with the East and with the New World . John Hawkins in 1562 seized three hundred Negroes along the Guinea coast of Africa , and carried them to America where he sold them at great profit to the Spaniards who needed laborers on their plantations and in the mines . Hawkins repeated this venture twice again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were attacked by a Spanish fleet and Hawkins and Drake barely escaped . In revenge Drake resorted t0 buccaneering or piracy , and preyed on Spanish shipping . His example was followed by many other English adventurers . Spanish shipping and the Spanish colonies suffered from their raids . One of Drake 's early adventures was the capture of a treasure caravan and thirty tons of silver in the Isthmus of Panama . In 1577 he rounded South America and sailed up the west coast . The Spanish ships carrying Inca treasure to the Isthmus were taken completely by surprise . Drake explored the California coast in search of a northwest passage , and then turned west and headed across the Pacific . Following Magellan 's route , he arrived in England in 1580 with such a cargo of gold and silver and spices and silks as had never been seen in England . He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth . THE INVINCIBLE ARMADA When Philip 's ambassadors protested against the English attacks upon Spanish shipping and settlements , Elizabeth pretended she was unable to control buccaneering activity . Yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits . Philip determined to put an end to English piracy . He built a  | teat armada , or fleet of ships , for the invasion of England . In May 1 j88 Philip 's fleet of one hundred and thirty ships set sail carrying 19,000 soldiers and 8,000 seamen . It has been calculated that the total tonnage of the fleet was about 57,868 tons , which is less than hat of the former Cunard liner Queen Mary . The English prep ; ired to meet the invasion and collected shipping all along the coast . The opposing fleets were about equal in tonnage , but the English ships were smaller , lighter , more maneuverable , and their guns had a ' reater range than the Spanish and could be fired faster . With these advantages the English succeeded in damaging and sinking a numI ter of the Spanish ships . With ammunition low , the Spaniards realized the venture was lost . As they turned toward home , a violent storm completed the havoc that had been begun by the English . The destruction of the Armada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's main attention was drawn to other fields . He sent a force into France to help the Catholic League in its war against Henry of Navarre in the hope both of combatting Protestantism and of keeping France engaged in internal strife . And for a time it seemed indeed as if France might lose all that she had gained under her long line of kings . The Absolute Monarchy in France FRANCIS ( 1515 ? 1547 ) had not hesitated to ally himself with the Moslem Turk or with the Protestant princes of Germany when by doing so he was able to cause trouble for the Hapsburgs . However he was not tolerant of Protestantism in France . His motto Un rot , une f oi , une loi , ? one king , one faith , one law ? expressed his conception of national unity . This was the view that was held throughout Europe until the middle of the seventeenth century . A subject who differed from his prince in religion was held to be treasonable .   The persecution of all those subjects who differed with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Francis I , was the normal and expected conduct of the time . When , after the Wars of the Schmalkaldic League , Lutherans and Catholics finally came to terms , the Peace of Augsburg recognized both religions . But when Calvinism spread into Germany , it was no more tolerated by Lutherans than by Catholics . And wherever the Calvinists established themselves they matched and surpassed the intolerance of others . It was an age of strong belief , and such an age is never one of toleration . In 1547 a special tribunal was added to the Parlement of Paris to deal with cases of heresy . It became known as the Chambre Ardente or Burning Court . Henry II ( 1547 ? 1559 ) continued the religious policies of Francis and attempted to establish the Inquisition in France . Nevertheless Protestantism spread . It was Calvin 's doctrines which appealed to Frenchmen rather than Luther 's . As this new faith spread , principally among the burgher population of the towns , its adherents became known as Huguenots . Henry II died in 1559 leaving three sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Francis II ( 1559 ? 1560 ) , Charles IX ( 1560-1574 ) , and Henry III ( 1574-1589 ) . During the brief reign of Francis II , who was the husband of Mary Stuart , Mary 's uncles , the cardinal of Lorraine and the duke of Guise , dominated France . But when Charles IX came to the throne his mother , Catherine de ' Medici , became regent during his minority . Catherine was an ambitious woman , a Medici , and a loyal Catholic . She seems to have been less interested in the welfare of France than in extending the influence of her family through good marriage connections and in advancing the interests of the Roman Catholic Church . THE WARS OF RELIGION In 1562 the duke of Guise came upon a congregation of Huguenots who were holding a church service in defiance of the local law . When the Huguenots were ordered to disperse , a quarrel resulted during which the duke 's men killed and injured many of the Huguenots . As the news of the incident spread , the Huguenots took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . When in 1563 the duke of Guise was killed , Catherine became the recognized head of the Catholic party .  | Despite the wars Calvinism spread . In 1570 Catherine adopted a policy of conciliation toward them . Admiral Coligny , the Protestant leader , was made a member of the cabinet and soon came to exercise a considerable influence over the king . This troubled Catherine who began to foresee the loosening of her dominance of the young king . Coligny escaped an attempt at assassination , and went direct to the king who promised a thorough investigation . Fearing the exposure of her guilty knowledge of the plot and the consequent loss of her position at court , Catherine gained the king 's ear , and won his consent to the famous massacre of the Huguenots which took place on St. Bartholomew 's Day 1572 . The slaughter of the Huguenot leaders , including Admiral Coligny , did not break the movement . The St. Bartholomew massacre had spread from Paris to other parts of the country , and the struggle was only further embittered as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his brother Henry III . In Henry 's reign France became divided into three factions : the extreme Catholic party led by Henry , duke of Guise ; the Huguenots , who had as their leader , Henry of Navarre ; and a moderate Catholic group known as the politiques who were inclined to the view that it was not necessary to exterminate the Huguenots in order to preserve the unity of France . The leader of this group was Henry III , king of France . The later phase of the religious struggles in France therefore is known as the Wars of the Three Henrys . Philip II of Spain supported the Guises and the extreme Catholic party , who became more powerful than the king . In 1588 Henry of France arranged the assassination of Henry , duke of Guise . He then joined Henry of Navarre , and together they laid siege to Paris which was in possession of the Catholic League . But Henry of France was assassinated in 1589 and there was left Henry of Navarre , leader of the Huguenots , who was heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remained a Protestant he would not be accepted by Catholic France . He therefore became a Catholic , and was crowned Henry IV ( 1589-161o ) . THE REIGN OF HENRY IV Henry was an able and popular ruler . When he ascended the throne the nobility were very powerful . Many of them would have   been glad to see a France without a king in which all power would lie in the hands of the nobles . But Henry addressed himself vigorously to the task of asserting and maintaining monarchical authority . In this he began the work which was completed under Richelieu and Mazarin . In restoring prosperity to France , Henry had the assistance of an able minister of finance , the duke of Sully . Sully stimulated the growth of agriculture and industry , reformed the tax accounting iii such a way as to lighten the tax burden , and by economy accumulated a treasury surplus . Henry aimed " to put a chicken in the pot " of every peasant family for Sunday dinner , as he himself expressed it . In 1598 Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Huguenots in France . By its terms they were granted liberty of belief , and they were to continue to enjoy freedom of worship wherever they had exercised that privilege during the two preceding years . The Huguenots were to be eligible for public office , to be admitted to schools , colleges , and hospitals . They might open up schools of their own . They were to be protected in the courts by the presence of Huguenot as well as Catholic justices . They were allowed their own press . And as a guarantee of all these privileges they were permitted to hold La Rochelle and about one hundred other fortified towns and cities . Interestingly enough this edict was condemned equally by Huguenots and Catholics . In 1610 the last of the " three Henrys " was assassinated by a religious fanatic . He was succeeded upon the throne by his young son , Louis VIII , whose mother Marie de ' Medici became regent of France . THE REGENCY OF MARIE DE ' MEDICI Instead of placing herself in the hands of the duke of Sully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied upon the counsels of an Italian adventurer , Concino Concini , and his wife . The nobles grew more powerful and the treasury was emptied . However one act of Marie 's proved especially fortunate for France . She appointed to the council , the young bishop of Lucon , Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu . When he reached the age of sixteen , the young king seized control of the government . Concini was murdered and his wife exe- cuted . Temporarily the queen mother and Richelieu were banished from court , but in 1622 a reconciliation was arranged and Richelieu became a member of the royal council . Louis XIII was quick to recognize the genius of his minister . By 1624 Richelieu was head of the state . RICHELIEU The outline of Richelieu 's broad policy is simple . It was to make the monarchy supreme in France and France supreme in Europe . In order to achieve the first of these purposes it was necessary for Richelieu to break the power of the nobles and of the Huguenots , the latter of whom , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . An uprising of the Huguenots gave Richelieu the opportunity he desired to destroy their military power . He personally organized and conducted the siege of La Rochelle and kept the English from relieving the city by constructing a great mole which closed the harbor . In the peace of Alais ( 1629 ) Richelieu confirmed the Huguenots in the possession of their civil and religious rights , but deprived them of the military and political privileges which had made them a separate state inside France . In 1626 Richelieu decreed the destruction of all fortified castles not necessary for defense against a foreign foe . He enforced the edicts against dueling and forbade private warfare . He established an administration of intendants in the provinces and transferred the police , judicial and financial administration from the nobles into the hands of these new representatives of the crown . By these measures Richelieu reduced the power of the nobles . In order to make France supreme in Europe , Richelieu had to reduce the power of the Hapsburgs . In this he followed the line of Francis I and Henrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessors . When the last of the religious wars broke out in 1618 ? the Thirty Years ' War  --  Richelieu followed its progress with close attention . Whenever the Hapsburgs seemed to have triumphed Richelieu used the influence of France to reopen the conflict . Finally , after Bohemia , Denmark , and Sweden had each fought and lost a phase of the long struggle , Richelieu took France into the conflict . Neither Richelieu , who died in 1642 , nor his king , Louis XIII , who died the following year , saw the conclusion of the struggle . But  | Richelieu had found and trained an able successor who carried on his work . This was Cardinal Mazarin . During Richelieu 's long and successful direction of the government of France , he was confronted by conspiracies and plots of a II sorts designed to bring him into disfavor with the king , and to topple him from office . Even the queen , Anne of Austria , and the queen mother , Marie de ' Medici , his former patron , were jealous of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust his great minister and to sustain him against attack although it must be admitted that during the early years , before the king had come to know and trust Richelieu thoroughly , there were times when the cardinal 's position was very insecure . MAZARIN Cardinal Mazarin was an Italian churchman whose abilities Richelieu early recognized . He was trained by Richelieu to succeed him as first minister and head of the state under the king . Mazarin was the real ruler of France after the death of Richelieu and during the minority of the young Louis XIV . Although Mazarin was an able ruler he was a foreigner ? he always spoke French with a marked Italian accent ? and he was blatantly greedy . He accumulated a great fortune and lavished wealth upon the members of his family who came from Italy and settled in France . It was obvious to the French that the wealth flaunted so arrogantly by the Mazarini had come out of their own pockets . In addition , the nobles made a last attempt to regain their lost power during the minority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the Fronde . There were two such outbreaks in Paris , both of which were success , fully put down with the help of troops returning from the Thirty Years ' War which had ended in 1648 . It was the last attempt of the nobles against the monarchy . When Mazarin died in 1661 , Louis XIV took charge of the government as his own first minister . It was the " sun king , " Louis XIV , who splendidly wielded the autocratic power that had been built up for him during long centuries of struggle by earlier monarchs and their ministers .  | Germany and the Thirty Years ' War IN 1555 THE SCHMALKALDIC WARS were brought to a conclusion by the Peace of Augsburg and Lutheranism was formally recognized . Under the terms of the peace each prince was free to decide whether Catholicism or Lutheranism would be the prevailing relicion in his domain . Many of the German princes and bishops who had been converted to Lutheranism had seized the lands and property of the Catholic church . It was agreed that all church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seized after that time was to be returned to the Catholic church . Any ecclesiastical prince who subsequently became a Protestant was to surrender his see . Lutheran subjects of Catholic princes were not to be forced to give up their beliefs . But the terms of the Peace of Augsburg were disregarded . Church property was not returned and further confiscations took place . In addition the Peace had recognized only the Catholic and Lutheran n religions . As Calvinism spread through the Germanies the Calvinists began to insist upon the same rights as were enjoyed by the Lutherans . A league of Protestant princes was formed in 16o8 , under the leadership of the Calvinist prince Frederick , of the Rhenish Palatinate , to secure a revision of the settlement . The Lutheran break with the Church of Rome had brought about The reformation ? or counter-reformation ? in the Catholic church . The Council of Trent , in several sessions between 1545 and 1563 , had reaffirmed and clarified the basic Catholic doctrines and had instituted a thorough-going reform of the clergy . The Society of Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the esuits devoted themselves to winning back to the church many who had accented the teachings of Luther and Calvin.
