In Orono , Me. , college boys from Dartmouth , Middlebury , McGill and the University of Maine turned their backs on baseball , track , golf and tennis last week to test their manly muscle with axes , saws , paddles , casting rods and peaveys ( for logrolling ) . It was the seventh annual Woodsmen 's Weekend , and it was designed to leave any modern Paul Bunyan hot and panting . <P> The Woodsmen 's Weekend was invented by Ross McKenney , veteran Maine guide and adviser to the Dartmouth Outing Club . Leather-lunged Guide McKenney , 61 , onetime ( and maybe still ) champion moose caller of the U.S .. - figures that woods-manship is a better sport than conventional college athletics : " It gives a man self-confidence . When he sleeps out and cooks his own meals , he learns not to be confused when he runs into a problem . " In Tall Timber . The first day 's competition began with fly and bait casting for accuracy and distance . Dartmouth 's powerful Noel ( " Chad " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait plug more than 180 ft. , longest ( by 30 ft. ) of the day . <P> Then the competitors tackled the tall timber , and the University of Maine 's woodsmen took over the scoring leadership . <P> Two of them sawed through a 9in . <P> balsam fir log in less than ten seconds , then with ropes twitched the 16-ft. length of timber across a 100-ft. course in a total time of 34.1 seconds for a new meet record . Records began falling as fast as the timber . With Maine coeds shouting " Go ! Go ! " from the sidelines , Maine 's lumberjacks set another record with cross-cut saws , still another in the log-chopping contest : three full cuts in 53.7 seconds . <P> For spectators , the most exciting event was the logrolling , which was substituted this year for fire-building ( scoffs Moose Caller McKenney : " Any campfire girl can build a bonfire " ) . Woodsmen 's logrolling is a relay event with two men handling the needle-sharp peaveys , wrestling a quarter-ton log over a soft . course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine won again . <P> In the Lake . The final event of the day was the 600-yd. packboard relay race , with a 50-lb. sack of sand strapped to the pack-board . With Day anchoring and charging down the football field like an express train , Dartmouth won in record time ( 2:20.0 ) , but Maine still held the overall team lead . <P> Ross McKenney 's Dartmouth boys- " the best team I ever had " - made a comeback on the final day in the canoe races . <P> The last event was a one-man canoe portage , a splashy spree in which a good many of the contestants got soaked . Still full of high spirits after the two-day grind , the wettest ones wound up by throwing judges , officials , girl timekeepers and handy bystanders into the lake . In the nip &; tuck finish , Dartmouth beat Maine , 1,148.7 to 1,107.4 . Canada 's McGill , which picked up a team only one day before the contest , wound up dead last and received a standard collegiate trophy : an empty beer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods in 1912 to help open Teddy Roosevelt 's third-term campaign by sounding the call of the bull moose from the Chicago convention platform .
