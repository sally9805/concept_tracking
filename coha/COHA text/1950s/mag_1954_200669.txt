Aug. 13 , under American rule , used to be known as Occupation Day in the Philippines . It celebrated the day U.S. armed forces wrested control of the islands from the Spaniards . When Filipinos got their independence in 1946 , they abruptly ceased observing Aug. 13 . <P> Last week President Ramon Magsaysay reinstated Occupation Day under a new and happier name : Philippine-American Day . Among those conspicuously observing it together : Admiral Raymond Spruance , the U.S. Ambassador , and the aging rebel chieftain Aguinaldo , who gave U.S. forces such trouble half a century ago . <P> In an age so marked by chafing nationalism , Ramon Magsaysay unashamedly spoke of " the deep appreciation and gratitude for all that America has done during the last half-century to help us attain the high state of progress and security we enjoy , " and " the pleasant and fruitful relationship " that exists today .
