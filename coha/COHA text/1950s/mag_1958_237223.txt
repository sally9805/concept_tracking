The mood of U.S. business last week was : " Wait for fall . " Most businessmen felt that the slide was ended , but few looked for any immediate big pickup in the face of the usual summer shutdowns . <P> The statistics looked brighter than at any time since the start of the recession , but the National Association of Purchasing Agents said : " None of the reporting members expresses any optimism over the immediate term . The majority look for no major breakthrough in the current lull before the year end or early 1959 . " <P> New car sales in the second ten days of June posted a 6.8% increase in daily rate over the first ten days , and last week 's production was up 9.6% . Ford Motor Co. returned to full-scale production , while Chrysler Corp . scored a 13% production boost in June . Yet even as the wheels rolled a bit faster , the industry got set for the annual model changeover shutdown . Buick production was stopped last week for approximately six weeks ; Chrysler will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ford in September . <P> Steel production is already starting down after hitting 64.9% of capacity and the highest level ( 1,751,000 tons ) of the year . Part of the decline could be attributed to vacation shutdowns , but much of it was due to a general fall-off in orders as companies finished the buying spurt they put on in anticipation of a price rise this month . One small specialty producer , Pennsylvania 's Alan Wood Steel Co. , whose 800,000-ton annual production ranks it 23rd in the U.S. , said it would boost prices an average $6 a ton , arguing that it could not absorb increased wage costs of 20 per hour on July 1 . <P> But the nation 's biggest steelmakers seemed in no rush to hike prices . U.S. Steel said only that it was " studying " Alan Wood 's move : so were Bethlehem Steel , Youngstown Sheet &; Tube , Armco Steel and Jones &; Laughlin , which added that it would not raise prices until U.S. Steel took the lead . Said Big Steel 's Chairman Roger M. Blough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change our prices until the situation is clarified . " When that might be , added Blough : " We can not forecast . " But for years , steel prices have climbed , along with boosts in minimum wages ( see chart ) , cost-of-living allowances and other costs .
