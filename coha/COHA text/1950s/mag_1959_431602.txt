 | HAVE YOU EVER been to Russia , Professor Hammond ? " This was the question that plagued me for years as I taught my courses in Russian history at the University of Virginia . It did n't matter that I was a graduate of the Russian Institute of Columbia University or that I had read many books about the Soviet Union . So long as I had not seen the country with my own eyes , my lectures and writings lacked a certain element of authority . To this oft-repeated question I had to reply , " No , I 've never been there . The Soviet Embassy wo n't give me a visa . " In 1955 I became hopeful . A number of Americans were admitted . and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas asked me to go with him as interpreter on his tour through Russia . But again the Soviet authorities turned me down , perhaps because they were reluctant to allow him an American interpreter . Three Visits in Three Years Finally , in 1956 , my opportunity came . By that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more foreign visitors , and visas became easier to obtain . That summer I served as leader of a group of Americans touring European Russia , and in the summers of 1957 and 1958 I returned alone . Now I can tell my students about experiences in 23 different Soviet cities and towns , of conversations in Russian with dozens of Soviet citizens , and of visits to collective farms , factories , universities , youth camps , and  | churches . I trust that now I am better able to give them an understanding of this vast and complex country . Like other visitors to Russia , I was under the care of Intourist , the national travel agency . Tourists are permitted to visit only certain cities . Within these cities , however , I was usually free to wander about alone , chatting with anyone I met . I was seldom aware of surveillance , but this may indicate simply that my shadowers were skillful . In any case , it was fairly easy for the authorities to keep track of me , for I was usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , or riding with an Intourist chauffeur . On my last trip I arrived in Moscow from Prague in a Tupolev 104-A , one of the new Russian jets that the Soviets were obviously proud to show off . There were new things to show off in Moscow too , for Russia puts its best foot forward for foreign visitors . One was a new 30-story hotel called the Ukraine . topped with a cafe , a tall steeple , and , at the summit , the inevitable red star . My two-room suite on the 27th floor had a magnificent view ? and a television set . I turned it on but got no picture , only sound . " Aha , " I thought , " like so many things in Russia , it ne rabotaet ? it does n't work . " The joke was on me ? telecasts did not begin until 7 p.m. that day . But the only program I could get then was a discussion of how to increase agricultural production . Tamara Takes Over as Guide No sooner had I arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . Like almost all Intourist guides , mine was female . She was Tamara. a solidly built , determined-looking Russian of 35 , daughter of the director of a large Moscow factory . She never tired of criticizing the United States and boasting about the supposed superiority of the Soviet system . Since she saw only one side to every question , and since she could talk faster and louder than I , there was little two-way conversation . It was more fun ? and much more rewarding ? to talk with chance acquaintances , who were not required to give me the Communist Party line . Soviet citizens . I found , are eager to meet Americans . They are no longer afraid to talk with foreigners , though they are careful what they say when others are listening . I spoke with all kinds of people , and , despite the constant anti-American propaganda disseminated by the Government , I almost never encountered hostility . My accent in speaking Russian sometimes confused those I met . Several times in outlying regions I was mistaken for a Russian from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that I was an American . Usually , however , my clothes ? especially my shoes ? identified me as a foreigner . Curbside Forum Discusses America One night in Kiev I fell into conversation with a man on the street . We chatted about the United States . Passers-by stopped to listen , and soon I found myself in the center of a crowd of fifty or sixty people . We were blocking the sidewalk on the main street , and the traffic officer on the corner looked unhappy . I suggested to my listeners that we break up the gathering . " No ! No ! " they insisted . " We want t talk with you . " So , like a celebrity surrounded by autogra ; , h seekers , I led my crowd up a side street . ar . they peppered me with questions : " Do people live better in America ? " " What is your salary ? " " What are the wages of an average worker - " How much does an American car cost " Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American foreign policy cropped up repeatedly : " Does America want war ? " " Why ca n't America and the Soviet Uni reach a disarmament agreement and end t threat of war ? "  | Often the questions disclosed a desire among viet citizens to travel in foreign countriesething very few have been permitted to do . ' hen I named for them the twenty or so untries that I had visited , they " oohed " and hed " with envy . " We are glad that you have come to see r country , " said one young girl . " Please d more Americans here . so that we can k with them and our two nations will come understand each other better . " I promised to do so . " And when will you be able to visit America ? " I asked . " Oh , " she laughed . " When the crawfish start to whistle , and the fish begin to sing ! " When I said good night , a man pressed a ver-plated matchbox into my hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souvenir of the ' endship of the Soviet people . " In Moscow , where foreigners are a common ght , one is less likely to attract a crowd , ut people approach you for other reasons . ttle boys waited in front of my hotel to k for chewing gum ? none is made or sold the U.S.S.R. ? or to swap znachki , badges d insignia which they collect and pin to their skullcaps . Some of the older boys have become " beeznis men . " My first acquaintance of this type was a young man of about 18 in a white nylon - hirt and shoes with thick rubber soles . " Wan na do a leetle beeznis ? " he asked in English . " What kind of business ? " Wan na sell suit , shirt , tie , shoes ? Anyteeng you got , I buy eet . " Sorry , but I need all the clothes I have . " - Maybe you got electric razor , jazz records , photo apparat , nylon stockeengs . Anyteeng . I pay much money .

They make copy in Kharkov . Eet look the same , but not good like Philips . Eet scratches . You see this nylon shirt ? Made in U.S.A. " To him and the many others like him I had to say , " Sorry , no sale . " The efficient Tamara took me in hand to show me the sights of Moscow . In the capital and show place of the Soviet Union , the gilded domes of ancient churches and monasteries are overshadowed by seven postwar skyscrapers in the exaggerated style sometimes sarcastically described as " Stalinist Gothic " ( next page ) . There is no shortage of things to do and places to go in Moscow . A recent guidebook lists 43 museums , 9 exhibitions , 30 theaters , and 13 principal parks and gardens , including one with the grandiloquent name Central Maxim Gorky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main attraction , however , is the Kremlin . Although everybody has heard of the Kremlin , few know what it means . " Kremlin " is simply the Russian word for " citadel . " It refers to the most ancient and strategic part of the city , which was ? and still is ? walled in by fortifications . The citadel contains old royal palaces , governmental bureaus , and churches where the tsars were crowned and buried . Some government offices , including Premier Khrushchev 's , are still located there and are closed to casual visitors , but other buildings have been opened to tourists since the death of Stalin . Royal Gems and a Gargantuan Gun Our first stop inside the Kremlin wall was the Armory , which contains a museum of tsarist treasures . A crowd of Soviet soldiers joined us in staring at the glass cases filled with jeweled crowns , robes , and golden dishes that had belonged to various tsars and their families . At the base of the tall Bell Tower of Ivan the Great , I saw the enormous Tsar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bulked another Kremlin attraction , the Tsar Pushka , King of Cannons . Seventeen feet long , with a barrel three feet in diameter , this 16th-century behemoth was designed to launch cannon balls weighing two tons each . But , like the great bell , Tsar Pushka was never used . I paused to watch groups of Soviet citizens , like tourists in any nation , posing proudly for snapshots before the giant relics. * Leaving the Kremlin through Spasskiye Gate , we entered Red Square . The huge cobblestoned rectangle was empty except for a long line of people ? whom I joined ? waiting to enter the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum. * Among 102 photographs illustrating Gilbert H. Grosvenor 's prophetic article " Young Russia : The Land of Unlimited Possibilities , " in the November , 1914 , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , appeared many pictures of the Kremlin 's treasures and of the Russian people and their life in prerevolutionary times .  | When we passed within the massive doors of the tomb , all conversation automatically ceased . At the foot of a dimly lighted flight of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in orange-colored light . I made out the features of Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin , both so well preserved that I had the uneasy feeling that they might come back to life and expel me as an unbeliever . Since I was particularly interested in the status of religion in the Soviet Union , Tamara arranged a Sunday morning visit to Moscow 's only Protestant church , that of the Baptists . We arrived at the church at eleven o'clock . People jammed the building and overflowed the doorways . The service , one of three that day , had already started ; so tightly packed were the aisles that we spent five minutes pressing our way to the pew reserved for us . Both the interior of the church and the order of service resembled those at home . In the balcony a choir sang familiar old hymns that were strange only for their Russian words . Behind the pulpit glowed a stained-glass window , its three-word message seeming to suffuse the entire church : Bog Est Lyubov , God Is Love . Baptists Provide New Russian Bibles After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivanov , and the Reverend Jacob Zhidkov , President of the All-Union Council of Evangelical Baptists . The Reverend Mr. Ivanov told me that the church also held services on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday . All were well attended . " How many Baptists are there in the Soviet Union ? " I asked the Reverend VIr . Zhidkov . " The church has more than half a million baptized members over the age of 18 , " he responded proudly . There are , I learned , more Baptists in the U.S.S.R. than in any nation other than the United States . During the thaw that followed the death of Stalin , the Soviet Government permitted the first Russian editions of the Bible since 1928 to be published . The Baptists printed 10,000 copies from matrices contributed by Americans , helping to relieve a critical shortage . The few Bibles previously available had been all but worn out . Later , at Zagorsk , 45 miles north of Moscow . I saw further evidence that religion in Russia is far from dead . There , where silent forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , I visited a venerable Orthodox shrine ? the Trinity Monastery of St. Sergius. founded in 1340 ( page 386 ) . I had arrived on the anniversary of the monastery 's founding , and thousands of pilgrims thronged the grounds . All waited patiently for an opportunity to enter one of the  | several chapels , where , amid the scent of intense and flickering red votive lamps , bearded priests chanted an age-old liturgy . I looked at the pilgrims ? old , wrinkled peasant women with kerchiefs around their hair ; young , fairly well-dressed adults ; even a handful of soldiers . Belief shone in every face . " Religion Is Like a Nail " Originally the Soviet regime had hoped to abolish religion in a few years , and the church was harshly persecuted . But as one commissar ruefully remarked : " Religion is like a nail ; the harder you hit it , the deeper it goes into the wood . " In recent years the Government has softened its campaign and has even opened some closed seminaries . Yet all public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the tomb of the tsar whose reign inspired Moussorgsky 's great opera Boris Godunov . I recalled the poignant , prophetic scene that ends Moussorgsky 's original version . Boris Godunov lies dead in the Kremlin , as the new claimant to the throne , Dmitri , marches toward Moscow . The flames of revolution redden the horizon , and a simpleton ? Moussorgsky 's symbol of the long-suffering Russian people wails in the forest : Russia 's sorrow is great .. . Cry ... cry ... Russian land ... hungry people ... cry .... Back in the capital I made my way to the towering new building of Moscow University .  | Like a wedding cake on a shelf , it perches on bluff above the Moscow River . The central multistory building " ? the word " skyscraper " not used in Russia ? contains more than 1000 study rooms and laboratories , auditourns and concert halls , a swimming pool , fining halls , and libraries ( page 365 ) . Better School Grades Bring More Money I asked Tamara if I could visit some students in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she replied , " but Intourist does not have the right to infringe upon the privacy of Soviet citizens . " Deciding to bypass Intourist , I stopped a student in the hall and asked if he would show me his room . He was happy to do so . Adolph had a small study-bedroom to himself and shared a bath with Vaclav , a student from Czechoslovakia . As we talked , their friend Boris joined us . All three were studying chemistry . " How much does it cost you to attend the university ? " I asked . - . There 's no tuition here or in any other school in the Soviet Union , " replied Adolph . " All education is free . " But what about your living expenses ? " - Like most students , " said Adolph , " we have government scholarships . The size of the scholarship depends upon the grades we make . For example , Boris gets 25 percent more than I do because he made all A 's , while I got one B. So you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do you have to do to get into the university ? " I asked . " Every applicant must take a competitive examination , and only the best get in . The competition is pretty stiff , especially in fields like engineering , where 10 or more students apply for every one admitted . " " Why did you decide to study chemistry ? " " Chemistry and other sciences have great prestige in this country , " said Adolph . " The president of the Academy of Sciences , Nesmeyanov , is a chemist . Everybody in Russia knows who he is . " " Also , " added Boris , " scientists are well paid , and chemists are in special demand now because the Communist Party plans a huge expansion in the production of plastics and synthetic fibers . " Not everyone in Moscow lives so well as the fortunate students at the university . Although new apartment houses are going up rapidly , many a Muscovite inhabits an old , dilapidated log cabin . " Housing is the No. 1 problem of our standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Government has declared that this problem must be solved within the next ten years . " Ivan 's Home : One Basement Room The next day I learned exactly how acute the housing shortage was . Ivan , a typical factory worker in his thirties , had agreed to show me his family 's apartment . We walked down one of Moscow 's main avenues to a building that looked quite presentable from the street . But within its courtyard the picture changed : a mass of rubbish covered one end ; rain had flooded the other part . We picked our way across the puddle and descended to the basement . The " apartment " consisted of one room , about 15 by 30 feet . Two iron beds were crammed on one side ; another bed , an unpainted wooden table , and a chest of drawers jammed the other . One corner , enclosed by a curtain , served as closet and dressing room . Near the top of one wall a solitary window framed a bleak view . " My mother , father , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , " said Ivan , " and we 're still here . "  | Down the hall he showed me a small kitchen and a toilet . In the hall was a wash basin . " We share these with two other families . Nobody tries very hard to keep them clean , because they figure the other families will only get them dirty again . " " What about baths ? " I asked . " We go to the public bath down the street . " " But how about all the new apartments being built ? " I asked . " Wo n't you get one ? " " I hope so , " said Ivan , " but some families are worse off than we . The population of Moscow has grown a lot since the Revolution . Also , hundreds of buildings were destroyed during the war . " Muscovites Show Off Their Subway When I met Ivan the next day , his face was creased with worry . " I guess I 'd better not see you any more , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I had brought a foreigner to my apartment . It 's best not to take any more chances . " On the way back to my hotel , I took an escalator to the subway . The Moscow subway , opened in the 1930 's , has long . : . known for its beauty . Each station glitt- , t with marble , glass , statuary , mosaics , indirect lights . At my stop one of the subway employ . came up . " Is the subway in New York beautiful as this ? " he asked . I think he ready knew the answer . " No , the New York subway is n't beautif at all . " At this his face brightened . But , I added , " the New York subway has than 400 stations , whereas you have about 46 . " " Well , " he said , " some day we will 500 stations , and all of them will be as 1 . some as these . " I often heard other Soviet citizens pride in their accomplishments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everything in terms competition between the two systems . One day I saw thousands of Muscovites - joying something that I never expected to in Russia ? horse racing . The Hippodrome featured both trotting flat races that Sunday afternoon . Not  | were there races , but ? much to my surprise ? there was organized betting . I took a seat on a bench amid a crowd of intent racing fans , each studying the list of horses for the next race with unmistakable zeal for capital gain . Next to me sat a friendly-looking old gentleman with a white mustache , riding pants , and leather boots . " The purpose of the races is n't to promote gambling , " he explained , " but to train , test , and develop better breeds of horses . " " But why does the Government need fast horses except for racing ? " I asked . " You do n't hitch a race horse to a plow . " When Russians go to the fair , smiles of anticipation light their faces . Scores of sprawling pavilions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though not for sale , these gay fabrics are a promise of tomorrow . The Kremlin . after decades of stressing heavy industry at the expense of consumer goods , last year called for expanded synthetic-textile production . Present-day prices are cruelly high : a rayon dress may cost $50 , a man 's suit of good quality up to $200 . ERICH LESSI 367  | Maybe you are right , " he conceded , smiling . " Maybe the real reason is that the Government gets a nice big cut out of the bets . Besides , a lot of people like horse races , including some who are pretty important . " Young Russians Like U. S. Jazz Moscow 's many theaters are well attended . In the famous Bolshoi I watched an unbelievably elaborate performance of Tchaikovsky 's Sleeping Beauty by Russia 's most illustrious ballet company ( page 376 ) . Elsewhere I saw War and Peace , the opera by Sergei Prokofiev based on Tolstoy 's famous novel . For years I had heard about Leonid Utesov and his jazz orchestra , and one night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an estradnyy , or variety , orchestra , for jazz is officially condemned as decadent . Nevertheless , the program included such American songs as " The Breeze and I , " " After You 've Gone , " " When Johnny Comes Marching Home , " and " Goodnight , Sweetheart . " Only once , however , did Utesov admit t he was playing an American tune . " And now comrades , " he announced , " we present genuine American composition , The Song the American Unemployed . ' The lyrics ha% been translated without change . " Utesov donned an old felt hat and a ra , -  | . thrust his hands into his pockets , ased a sad , hopeless look , and sang the song of the depression era , " Brother , Can ou Spare a Dime ? " So propaganda enters n into the program of a jazz band . Despite official disapproval , the young le love jazz . Many of them listen to a ce of America program called " Music S.A .. " which . unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met two jazz fanciers ? Nicho. a tall , lean geology student , and his - acious girl friend Galina , who was studyelectronics . They invited me up to Nichol room to hear his records . Some were Soviet pressings of old American tunes such as " I Saw Stars " and ' Lady , Play Your Mandolin . " His most prized recording was Elvis Presley singing " Jailhouse Rock . " " Where did you get that ? " I asked . " An American sold it to a friend of mine . and he sold it to me , " replied Nicholas . " Soviet turntables do n't run at 45 r.p.m. , but I slow mine from 78 r.p.m. with my finger . " I noticed some discs of what seemed to be photographic film . " What are they ? " I asked . " Those are old X-ray films , " said Nicholas . " A friend of mine has a recording machine . but the only material we can get to cut records on is this film . It 's not high fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . " " What 's that one ? " I asked . " Oh , " he replied , laughing . " that 's Glenn Miller 's Moonlight Serenade , ' with a compound fracture on the other side . " Children Come First in Russia In many ways , children in the Soviet Union are given the best of everything . It is quite common to see parents in old , faded clothing leading children dressed in the newest and brightest attire . The Soviet regime follows much the same policy , taking great pains to see that children are well cared for and that they become loyal supporters of Communism . The Soviet Union does not permit Boy or Girl Scout organizations but promotes instead two Communist youth groups : the Pioneers , 9 to 14 ; and the Komsomols ( Communist Youth League ) , 15 to 28 . Most cities have elaborate children 's clubs called " Pioneer Palaces , " and many children spend summer vacations in inexpensive Pioneer camps . I visited one of these camps near Zvenigorod , about 30 miles west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle , a gingerbread house . and a log cabin : there were also a puppet theater. a radio station , and equipment for numerous other activities . Igor , a handsome blond boy of 15 who was vice president of the camp , showed me through the library . On the wall in a place of honor I saw a photograph of a young boy . " That , " said Igor , " is Pavlik Morozov , a hero to all Soviet youth . In 1932 , during the drive to collectivize agriculture , his father tried to organize resistance . Pavlik informed Stiff-as-starch honor guard stands by as Premier Nikita Khrushchev meets Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan at Moscow 's Vnukovo Airport . An interpreter walks behind them .

" After a moment he returned with a toy helicopter . " Give this to some American boy , " he said , " to show the friendship of Soviet children for American children . " By Red Arrow to Leningrad When the time came for us to leave for Leningrad , Tamara obtained tickets for the Red Arrow , the best train in the U.S.S.R. The Red Arrow turned out to be modern and comfortable enough , except for one thing ? no air conditioning . As we sped through the countryside , the conductress brought us hot tea in glasses , which is the usual Russian way . Tamara began rubbing her face with something from a small bottle . " What 's that ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained . " It 's very good for the complexion . " Leningrad , surprisingly , does n't look very Russian . The buildings are neoclassic and baroque , with stuccoed walls in green , yellow , pink , or maroon . This is because Leningrad is not an old city but dates from the early 18th century , when western European styles were favored by Russian tsars and aristocrats . Tsar Peter the Great founded the city in 1703 , named it St. Petersburg , and made it his capital . It remained the political , cultural , and social center of Russia until 1918 , when the Bolsheviks returned the capital to Moscow . After Lenin 's death in 1924 the city , then called Petrograd , was renamed Leningrad . Walking through Leningrad one day , - I found myself in front of an imposing building in classical style , with long colonnades curving out from either side . It looked like a smallscale imitation of St. Peter 's in Rome . The present purpose of the building , ho+cever , is far from spiritual . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Istorii Religii ?

Peasant women with white scarves over their heads sat among piles of gunny sacks and wicker baskets , while children slept beside them . My sleeper was called a " soft " car , which meant that the compartments were fairly spacious and the berths had springs . Next to it was a car marked " hard .

Citizen Poimanov Issues a Warning One day in Riga I told the chauffeur I wanted to photograph a panorama of the city . We drove across the river to a spot with a good view of the Old Town , with its many towers and spires . I walked down to the riverbank and took several shots . As I headed back toward the car , I suddenly noticed a uniformed policeman wagging an ominous finger in my direction . " Follow me , " he said . The policeman led me across the street to a serious-looking man in civilian clothes . " You have violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have photographed a bridge . " " I did n't photograph any bridge , " I replied angrily , for I had been extremely careful not to take pictures of bridges . " I saw you do it , " he insisted . " No , you 're mistaken , " I repeated . " Come with me , and you can look through the camera from the spot where I was standing . " We walked back to the shore of the river , and he looked through the view finder of my camera . No bridge was visible . " But you took pictures back there by the car , " he said . " There you can see the bridge . " " I did n't take any pictures by the car , " I said . " Ask my guide . She 'll tell you . " Little did I know my friend Tamara . " It 's not my fault , " she insisted , for fear she might get into trouble . " I told him not to take pie-  | tures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our country , and you should give him a good warning . " With this encouragement from Tamara the plain-clothes man proceeded . " You took pictures of the bridge , " he said , and we must give you a written warning . Show me your passport . " " All right , " I said , " but you must show me your identification papers also . " " I 'm just an ordinary Soviet citizen , " he said , handing me an identification card in a blue cover . It read : Factory No. 299 POIMANOV , VLADIMIR IVANOVICH Bookkeeper " If you 're just an ordinary citizen , " I asked , " what right do you have to tell people what to do ? " " It is the duty of every Soviet citizen to be on guard against lawbreakers , " he said sternly . " We must maintain Socialist vigilance .

Thomas Taylor Hammond on the 3d of July 1958 at 11:40 was present at the wooden bridge on the Zadvinia side and photographed a panorama of Old Riga with a view of the October Bridge . Citizen Thomas Taylor Hammond was warned that it is prohibited to photograph the above-mentioned bridge and we suggested to him that he choose a more suitable place for photographing Old Riga , and composed the present statement to that effect . ( Signed ) Kolosov Poimanov They gave me a copy and went away . I got back in the car and glared at Tamara . " You certainly are a helpful guide , " I said . Our next stop , Kiev , with a population of some 1,100,000 , is the third largest city in the Soviet Union . after Moscow and Leningrad : dating back to the ninth century , it is also one of the oldest . As Ukrainians will proudly inform you , it was the capital of the first organized Russian state . Beautifully sited on hills overlooking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasant parks . From a park near the center of Kiev , I looked down to the broad Dnieper . Below , a huge statue of St. Vladimir , the Kievan prince who in 988 made Christianity the official Russian religion , stared into the distance . According to a chronicler , Vladimir had sent envoys to seek out a suitable religion for his people . Unimpressed by Judaism , Roman Catholicism , or Islam , the envoys were awestruck by the magnificent Orthodox ritual they witnessed in Constantinople . They reported : " ... We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth . For on earth there is no such splendor nor such beauty , and we are at a loss how to describe it . We only know that God dwells there among men , and their service is fairer than the ceremonies of other nations . I made my way down the river to the famous Monastery of the Caves , for centuries a meeting ground of devout Orthodox pilgrims . This is easily the most sacred spot in Russia , for no fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . I bought a candle from the bearded priest at the door to the catacombs and stumbled along by its meager light . Small niches held the coffins of the saints . Through the glass tops of the coffins I could see their elaborate vestments . Pilgrims knelt to pray or to ki the top of a coffin , while others stopped burn a candle in front of an icon . Flying over Russia 's Breadbasket From Kiev I took a small two-engine passenger plane south to the Black Sea . At ' flew at about 750 feet ? perhaps not the saf altitude , but one that afforded a fine view the countryside below . For a while we followed the meanderi Dnieper and then struck out across the brc Ukrainian steppes , breadbasket of the U.S.S. The wheat fields stretched away like a hu yellow sheet , patched here and there by gr squares of pasture . Harvesting machines geometrical patterns in the yellow grain . Peasant cottages huddled in bunches , e with a small vegetable garden and a few f trees . Sometimes a church dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ po flecked with the white of ducks and geese . We skimmed down at the unpaved Kher : airport . Everyone piled out and headed p 391 all wooden building with a sign ' Buffet . re one harried woman passed out beer , mineral water , and lemonade . The only food I could find was black bread and cheese . The contrast between the rather primitive ilities on this flight and my earlier flight Moscow by jet could hardly have been ter . I remembered then and on many er occasions what an American friend had me in Moscow : In Russia the best is very good , sometimes e . e- best in the world , as the Sputniks have n . But the average in most fields is ? ea- poor , far below the average in the tutted States . " From our next stop at Simferopol , a car k us over the mountains to the Black Sea and then along the coastal road to Yalta . With its deep-blue water , craggy shore , white villas , and granite mountains rising , harply behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular resort today . It most famous , of course , as the site of the ; - time conference between President Roose . Prime Minister Churchill , and Premier : lin , and the first thing I went to see was : . : . adiya Palace , where the meetings were held . Built for Tsar Nicholas II in 1911 , Livadiya Et s been used since the Revolution as a rest l : .. me for workers . Upstairs we were shown the former bedroom of the tsar . The guide did not miss this opportunity to get in a bit of propaganda . This room was formerly occupied by one iespot , " she said . " Now it is shared by 10 - nresentatives of the toiling masses . " I also visited the modest home of Anton Chekhov , who lived in Yalta from 1899 to 1904 and wrote some of his famous plays and stories there while trying to recover from the tuberculosis that finally killed him . Tha house is now a museum . A Russian friend had told me : " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side trip to Bakhchisaray , the old capital of the Crimean Tatar khans . You 'll suddenly find yourself in the Middle East . " I took his advice , setting out by car one morning across the mountains . Driving through the narrow streets of Bakhchisaray , we came to a group of buildings surrounded by a wall . Two slender minarets reached up into the sky , and tiny pointed chimneys projected from tiled roofs in typically Turkish style . Here for centuries the Tatar khans lived , prayed to Allah , housed their numerous wives , and planned their raids into Russian territory . The Tatars swept into Russia in 1237 , killing and plundering , to set up an oppressive rule that lasted more than two centuries . Ivan III finally threw off their yoke in 1480 . Tatars from the Crimea continued to make annual raids , however , and in the campaign of 1571 captured 100,000 Russian slaves . Not until 1783 was Russia finally able to annex the Crimea and its Tatars . Though the palace of the khans remains , I saw not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the Revolution they had their own Tatar Autonomous Republic , but were unhappy under Soviet rule and during World War II welcomed the invading Germans as liberators . Stalin wreaked vengeance by killing some , deporting the rest to the interior , and abolishing the Crimean Tatar Republic . On my two earlier trips I had visited another fascinating part of Russia , the mountainous , oil-rich Caucasus , between the Black and Caspian Seas . Such strategically important places as the big oil center of Baku , however , were out of bounds . From Ordzhonikidze in the northern Caucasus I traveled south over the Georgian Military Highway , one of the most spectacular mountain roads in the world . It climbs the steep gorge of the Terek River to one of the few passes through the Caucasus range. * Along the way we saw white-capped 16,558-foot Mt . Kazbek , where , according to legend . Prometheus was chained . The road passed square towers that in ancient times were used to warn the mountaineers of approaching enemies . In small patches of meadow , bearded , fur-capped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proud Georgians Recall Their Past Russians say that people live longer in the Caucasus than anywhere else on earth ; there are cases of people who claim to be 130 o -- even 140 . I saw a stooped , grizzled old man by the roadside and asked him his age . " Over 100 , " he replied . " How much over 100 ? " I asked . " Is n't that enough ? " he grunted . " Why do you care ? Are you going to buy me like a horse ? " Finally we came to Tbilisi , old Tiflis , capital of the Georgian S.S.R. Unlike the Russians , the Georgians are not Slavic but speak a  | strange language , written in a curious , twirling script . Georgian men , with their bushy black mustaches and fierce eyes , are tough and masculine . They are also hospitable . Walking into a restaurant alone one night , I was unable to find an empty table . A group of Georgians invited me to join them , filled me with delicious Georgian dishes and wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me with pride of Georgia 's long history . " Georgia was an independent kingdom for 2,000 years , " said one . " Our civilization is much older than that of the Russians . Georgia had many great kings , scholars , and poets . The greatest poet , Rustaveli , lived in the 12th century , in the time of Queen Tamara . " " How did Georgia lose its independence ? " I asked . " It is simply a matter of arithmetic , " answered one of my new acquaintances . " There are only four million Georgians , but we were bordered on one side by Iran , on another by Turkey , and on still another by Russia . It was impossible to remain independent with such powerful neighbors . " " Local Boy " Neglected Georgia The best-known Georgian in modern times was Stalin , whose real name was Djugashvili . I asked my friends what they thought of him . They expressed pride in the local boy who made good , but also felt he had not defended Georgia 's interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but after he got to Moscow , he forgot his people . " " How have things been for Georgia since Stalin died ? " I asked . " Worse . " said one . " Our soccer team is n't allowed to beat the Russian team any more ! " Flying northwest from Tbilisi , I came to Kharkov , chief city of the eastern Ukraine , where I visited a show place , the Ordzhonikidze tractor factory . Completed during the first five-year plan with the help of American engineers , it has played a key role in mechanizing the collective farms . I asked the chief engineer about wages . " The average worker 's wage is 850 rubles a month , " he said . Calculating at 10 rubles to the dollar , this would come to $85 . " But some of our best workers , " the engineer added . " make as much as 3,000 rubles . All are on a piecework system . If one worker makes more castings than another , he gets paid more . " Foreman Earns 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system applied also to his salary as chief engineer . " Yes , " he replied . " My regular pay is 4,000 rubles a month , but if the factory exceeds its goal , as fixed in the national economic plan , I get a bonus . Last year I got a total of about 8,300 rubles a month . " " In other words , " I said , " you get 10 times as much as some of the workers . That 's a bigger difference than you 'd find in most American factories . Is n't this contrary to the idea that under Communism everybody will be equal ? " " We do n't claim to have Communism yet . " he said . " We are still moving toward it . " I found that almost the whole life of the workers revolves around the tractor plant For example , 90 percent of them live in factory-owned apartments . Sports competitions take place in the factory 's stadium . The cultural commission of the trade union supervises the workers ' library , arranges for lectures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care under the state health program begins with the factory dispensary . " In addition , " said the chief engineer , " the children of the workers attend nurseries , kindergartens , and summer camps sponsored by the factory . Also , there is a loan fund fro ? which the employees can borrow money . " You might say , " he added , " that the trar-union looks after the workers from the crag . ' - to the grave , for when a worker has a child hreceives a birth allowance , when he retires It -- gets a pension , and when he dies his fami ' , is given a burial grant . " " Does the trade union have any other fur - tions ? " I asked . " Yes , " he said , " it tries to increase pr - duction . For example , it encourages worke-=  | to think up faster and better ways of doing their jobs , it holds meetings to discuss methof raising productivity , and it organizes mpetitions to see who can produce the most .

All day ng in front of my hotel there was a steady procession of barefoot women in homespun linen dresses and woolen aprons . While taking a stroll around town one night before going to bed , I noticed a crowd of about 25 people on the sidewalk in front of darkened furniture store . " Now do n't forget , I 'm number 15 , " I heard one woman say . " I 'll be gone for just a minute while I get my husband to take my place . " " What 's going on ? " I asked one of the men . " We 're waiting to buy chairs , " he replied . I looked through the window . Piled high were plain , straight-backed wooden chairs such as one might find in a cheap restaurant . " You mean you 're going to wait in line all night long ? " I asked in amazement . " Of course , " he answered . And early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown to about 75 people . The Soviet Government has established a historical museum in Chernovtsy , designed among other things to demonstrate the evils of Austrian and Romanian rule and , by contrast , the great improvements allegedly wrought by the Communists . One painting in the museum showed a group of ragged , half-starved peasants traveling across the prairie in covered wagons . A dead man lay on the ground , a candle on his breast , while others knelt in prayer over his body . This was supposed to represent the fate of prewar emigrants from Bucovina to tte United States and Canada ! Collective Farm Covers 3,500 Acres Traveling northwest across Galicia , almost to the Polish frontier , we came to the large city of Lvov . This whole area was under Polish rule until September , 1939 , when Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between them . From Lvov we drove to the Stalin Kolkhoz. a collective farm , where we were greeted by the director , Comrade Silaev ( page 392 ) , and by Comrade Gaivoronyuk , a Communist Party " instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of cow barns and pigpens , a low-lying pasture , fields of wheat and rye almost ready for harvesting , a blacksmith shop , a mill for mixing feed , a veterinary laboratory , and a duck pond . It also included a cluster of cottages , some brick , some with thatched roofs . " How picturesque ! " I said , pointing to the old-style cottages . " Oh , those are remnants of our backward past , " said the Party man . " Soon they will be replaced . " The director explained that the farm had about 3.500 acres of land , of which 2.300 were plowland , and 280 working members ? or about 121 acres per worker . Here , as else-397  | where under the collective system , a lot of labor was required to farm little land . This partly explains why agricultural production is low in the U.S.S.R. , despite the fact that about 40 percent of the population works on farms . In the United States , by contrast , about 10 percent of the population , using more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of tractors , combines , and other agricultural machines . " Where did you get the machinery ? " I asked . " Until this year a machine-tractor station served this and 10 other kolkhozes , " said the director . " Then it was dissolved , and we bought some of its equipment . It gives us more freedom to plow and harvest when we want . " " How do members of the kolkhoz get paid ? " " The profits are divided up among the members on the basis of the kind of work they do and the number of days that they work . " Is this their only source of income ? " " Oh , no , " the director replied . " Each family has a private plot of about an acre to farm independently of the kolkhoz . They raise vegetables , fruit , poultry , and a certain amount of livestock , and sell their surplus in the free market . Previously there were compulsory deliveries to the Government from the privat plots , but these have been done away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " each family haa small private farm on the collective farm " That 's right , " he answered , " but the size of the private plot ca n't be bigger than half a hectare , * and each member must work a certain number of days for the collective .

English and German are now the most popular choices . @# This reminded me of a conversation I had had the year before with an official in one of the ministries . He talked with surprising frankness about so-called " kolkhoz democracy . " When I asked him if the Government gave advice to the kolkhozes on what to plant , when to plant , and so on , he replied : " We do n't advise them . We tell them ! " At this he let out a big laugh . It seemed best not to describe this incident to my kolkhoz hosts . Instead it had become my turn to make a toast . " May all the peoples of the world live in peace , freedom , and democracy , " I said , and the glasses of vodka were emptied . I shook hands with everybody , thanked them for their hospitality , and left while I could still walk . In my private conversations with Soviet citizens I heard many references to the system of universal free medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system at work . Dr. Natalia Fedorovna Krainyaya , the director , greeted me cordially and handed me the white hat and coat all visitors to Soviet hospitals must wear . The wards , containing from 6 to 12 beds , were clean and sunny . I was permitted to look in all but the maternity ward . Even fathers , I was told , have to wait 10 days before seeing their new babies . Most U.S.S.R. Physicians Are Women I noticed that most of the physicians were women ( page 404 ) . " Is this typical of the U.S.S.R. ? " I asked . " Yes , " said Dr. Krainyaya , " about three fourths of our physicians are women . So is the Minister of Health of the U.S.S.R. We feel that because medicine does not involve heavy physical labor , it is more suitable for women than , for example , work in a coal mine . " " How much are physicians paid ? " I asked . " A beginning graduate , fresh from medical school , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years there is an automatic raise of about 100 rubles a month .

" In the Union we are graduating twice as many ans each year as does the U.S.A. As a we now have a ratio of 17 physicians 000 of the civilian population , whereas -e a ratio of only about 13.

For example , when a student graduates from medical school , he must go wherever the Government says for his first three to five years . That usually means a village , or some place like Siberia or central Asia , where facilities are primitive . " What makes our work hectic , " he added , " is the norms set by the Government . In an out-patient clinic , for example , a physician must see six patients an hour ? 10 minutes per patient . Then he has to spend more than half of that 10 minutes filling out papers .

" Uzhgorod Speaks Many Tongues My next stop was Uzhgorod , on the other side of the Carpathian Mountains . This is the most scenic region of the entire Ukraine . Unfortunately I could see little of it , since it is classed as a frontier area and foreigners are not permitted to leave the city limits . Yet Uzhgorod itself proved to be a fascinating provincial town . It lies in a pocket in the Carpathians where Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Poland , the Soviet Union , and Romania meet , and its population is a strange mixture of nationalities . My waiter was Romanian , my driver Slovak , the hotel maid Ukrainian , and the Intourist representative Russian . A large minority of the population is Hungarian . In the cheerful little garden restaurant behind my hotel I could eat Hungarian goulash , drink Tokay wine , listen to a gay gypsy band , and watch local couples dance a hearty czardas .

But after the Revolution I got a larship to the Academy of Agriculture in ow , where I eventually received my deof Doctor of Science .

This was only a sample of the vicious anti-American propaganda that is constantly spread by the Soviet Government ? while at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time had come for me to leave the Soviet Union . We drove in the dark at 4 a.m. to Chop , the frontier station where I had to pass customs before boarding the train for Czechoslovakia . When I entered Russia , the customs inspection was quite superficial , but Chop was another story . The woman inspector searched slowly through all five of my bags . Whenever she came across written matter , she handed it to a man near by who looked it over with great care . He seemed to take special interest in a copy of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , which he thumbed through page by page . " Do you have any notebooks ? " he asked . I showed him the spiral booklet that I had used as a diary , and he took a look at that also . But apparently he found nothing " subversive , " so I passed through unscathed .

At the frontier the train stopped for several minutes while armed guards made a meticulous search beneath each car to make sure that no one was hiding on the undercarriage . Looking out the train window , I noticed a huge sign made by placing white stones on the rail embankment . In the center were two white doves of peace , and over them the words , " FOR PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP . " A few yards away was the frontier itself , with two high barbed-wire fences , bordered by a grassless strip of plowed earth , on the far side of which was a third fence . In the distance was a watchtower , and silhouetted in the top I could see a guard with a rifle in his hand . f KURUNIN
