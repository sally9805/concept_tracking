 | HERE in the cloud forest of New Guinea 's central highlands the night had been long and wet , but dawn l nearly come now , and the rain had gypped . The two natives who had slept : ully on a bed of leaves beside my cot crouched , shivering , over their smudgy fire . To the tribesmen in a near-by hut I shouted , " Workem ki ! " ( " Get the food ready ! " ) . Soon a big , jet-skinned mountaineer entered the shack carrying bread , a can of butter , and a pot of steaming coffee . A few minutes later we took off through the dripping vegetation , feeling our way over a steep , muddy trail cluttered with fallen timber . Through rhododendronlike growth we climbed steadily to 7,500 feet until , just ahead , we made out our well-camouflaged objective ? the 50-foot tower of poles and vines we had fastened together the day before .

Why ? Just to see some birds ! For this I had bought , nine months before , food and equipment for 900 man-days in one of the remotest parts of the globe . For this I had stocked up with ? among other things ? enough yeast and flour to bake 200 loaves of bread , and half a dozen soccer balls to give to important chiefs . In the National Geographic Society 's headquarters at Washington , I had worked day after day striving to master the mysteries of electronic lighting and the complexities of special cameras . Yes , all this just to see some birds . But what birds ! Our quarry was no less than the birds of paradise ? especially the most spectacular of them all , the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive to a zoo , and that one died almost immediately . No still pictures of this bird of paradise in its native habitat had yet been made . Until our 1950 trip to New Guinea two years before , only one or two white men had witnessed its peculiar , long-fabled dance of courtship , * The King Woos a Queen Despite the rarity of paradise birds , we had already seen their plumes by the score . Natives hunt them with the intensity of gold prospectors , and on special occasions wear fantastic arrays of plumes beyond all price . Reserved for chiefs are those of the King of Saxony , whose wooing we now hoped to watch ( pages 444-445 ) . Reaching the top of the tower , I set up tripods , cameras , and sound recorder . Then I aimed a 16-inch telephoto lens at a little spirelike limb that rose in the mist above the crown of a subtropical forest giant .

We waited minute after long minute . At last a small bird , hardly larger than a robin , flew to the perch . Dipping and bowing , he began like a drunken devil to wave and toss his weird , exotic plumes . Were they feathers ? We knew they were ; yet they strained credulity . Pointed , brilliant , they seemed to spring like horns from the bird 's crown , trailing behind him in two fantastic parabolas . Here was the King of Saxony indeed , panoplied like a Teutonic monarch riding to battle with great plumes streaming from his casque of iron . Through the binocular I saw that the bird 's breast was egg-yellow , his plumes sky-blue . He grasped a slender vine and , after a few moments of nervous gawking , began to bounce up and down , like a diver testing a board . The short black-velvet cape covering his back spread out over his shoulders like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempo of his bouncing increased . The magnificent plumes swept forward and down like the tines of a huge fork . Uncontrollably excited , the King became a trapeze artist . From his beak issued a series of hissing notes , like steam escaping . I scanned the perch for the female bird who must be there . I could not spot her rather drab body , but neither had I been able to see her in 1950 , the only other time I had witnessed this dance . Yet on the movie film we brought back it was possible to glimpse her demure entry into the nuptial chamber . As suddenly as it began , the dance concluded . The King , reaching a climax of ecstasy , leaped upward in a great flutter of wings , then flew off to another of his dance trees , beyond our visual range . Climax of Centuries-old Search The scene we had just watched was , in a way , the culmination of a search some four centuries old . The date when the plumes of a bird of paradise first reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite description of them came from two skins brought back from the Moluccas in 1522 by Magellan 's men on their return from the circumnavigation of the globe. * Few things from the Orient stirred the imagination of Europeans more . The plumes of later specimens were attached to skins from which the feet and legs had been removed , a procedure still followed today by native collectors . Europeans decided that these extraordinary birds had no feet and that they must have been blown to earth from a celestial paradise . The legend faded , of course , but the name remained : These were the " footless " birds of paradise ? species apoda . And , because white @# men over the years continued to rely exclusively upon aborigines to trap or shoot the specimens , the birds remained long among the least-known of all the spectacular forms of animal life inhabiting the world . To dispel some of the mystery which still clung to these birds , I had led an expedition for the American Museum of Natural History , New York City , into remote ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of birds , among them 19 forms entirely new to science . In addition , we had found the display grounds of bowerbirds and of some of the rarest of the birds of paradise . How the 1952 Expedition Began I had wanted , however , to go back again . We had done much , but there was much yet to be discovered , pinned down , recorded on sound track , film , and notebook . Thus I was elated when , at the Explorers Club in New York one evening , a tall , deeply tanned member approached me , introduced himself as Armand Denis , and suggested I organize another expedition to New Guinea . Quickly we came to an agreement . Denis ( producer of many fine films , among them Dark Rapture and Savage Splendor ) would be the leader ; I , the general manager .

It was one thing , of course , to plan such an expedition from the comfort of our armchairs , but quite another to get it into territory long charted as " uninhabited . " We never could have accomplished it without the sympathetic help and interest of the New Guinea authorities . When , for example , we arrived at Lae , our lumping-off place on New Guinea 's east coast , we found that air travel into the interior no longer looked quite as simple or safe as it had from New York . A rather dispiriting list of accidents , in fact , had piled up since our last flights out of Lae in 1950 . In the interim , the pilot of Count N. C. G. F. Gyldenstolpe , a Swedish naturalist , and all the count 's scientific materials had been lost in 1951 , smashed against a hidden peak of the Bismarcks . The pilot we had last flown with in New Guinea had crashed on a mercy flight two days after we left . Bill Lamont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at Madang . Father Michael Bodnar had barely survived a wreck in the interior . Even our own pilot for the forthcoming venture ? the much-decorated wartime flyer , Robert Gibbes had lost two planes in the previous two years . When my wife and I , then , climbed into a 15-year-old light plane for a reconnaissance flight with pilot Larry Crowley , we experienced just a touch of misgiving . We took off safely , however , skimming the 100-foot-high matted forests which border Lae , and followed the broad valley of the Markham River ( map , above ) . Threading the Bismarck Passes For an hour and 10 minutes we flew inland , until before us loomed the 12,000-foot peaks of the Bismarck Range , fringed with clouds . Dodging rafts of mist , Crowley spiraled upward , searching for an opening . At last he found one , and we bored through the Chimbu gorge and planed down a narrow valley . We headed toward a plateau which extends north from the Kubor Range in a series of lobes overlooking the Wahgi River ( opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there by wider roads , the area under cultivation looked prolific and luxuriant . Flat-topped promontories capped with casuarina forest and dotted with native gardens  | etched between the hills like outilung fingers ( page 458 ) . On one of these lay a green strip . This was our destination , the tiny airrid maintained by Father Bodnar at Kup . Threading the tight gorges of the Wahgi , rowley set our little plane down expertly , en swerved it sharply as a horde of savages iverged upon us . They were not trying to alp us ? just to greet us ( page 422 ) . We knew they had gathered for some cereonial occasion , for they were all splendidly turned in rare bird of paradise feathers . They were followed a moment later by Father Bodnar himself , one of those grand , self-effacing pioneers one meets occasionally in the big bush , who had in so many ways befriended us on our 1950 expedition . We joined forces again with much backslapping and enthusiasm , in which the good padre participated with even greater fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bailiwick . For several hours we explored the vicinity , finally deciding on a near-by promontory for our site . Then I sent word to Maima , chief of the Kubor tribes , asking him to come and see me on my return to Kup later . It was important that he should . Two years before , we had plunged deep into his realm , entering valleys no white foot had yet trod , and , with Maima 's assistance , had climbed to the high plateaus where the rarest birds of paradise make their homes . With his cooperation , our second exploration might be even more profitable . Bush Telegraph Brings Help Back to Lae we flew and , on March 29th , returned in Gibbes 's plane with two tons of gear and Robert Doyle . This time we set natives to constructing 16 buildings which would comprise our base camp at Kup ? aviaries , a mess hall , cookhouses , work sheds , a powerhouse , storehouse , and dormitories , the whole compound surrounded by a large fence . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by E. Thomas and Margaret Giliiard , American Museum-Armand Denis Expedition - Crowned Pigeon Carries a Lacy Crest Like a Dowager 's Frilly Hat Goura victoria beccarii , the Crowned Pigeon , is as closely identified with New Guinea as are the birds of paradise . Like them , it was once slaughtered for gorgeous , lacy feathers . Today , although protected rigidly by government decree , it seems doomed to extinction like its relative the dodo . Natives continue to hunt the chicken-size bird for its delicious white flesh . When one of a flock is shot , the others gather on low limbs , gawk at the hunters , and invite a similar fate . One man , zoo director Paul L. Breese of Honolulu , has succeeded in breeding the bird . Inset : Superb Fruit Pigeon ( Ptilinopus superbus ) ranges from Celebes and New Guinea to Australia . Wearing a variety of colors , it appears as gaudy as the fruit on which it lives . native boys who had worked for us in 1950 had picked up word of our arrival on the bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drift into camp . Among them were Mar , a good taxidermist ready for any job demanding perseverance and leadership , but equally ready to make himself scarce when confronted with more routine tasks : and Tai , courageous enough to climb the topmost pinnacle of Mount Wilhelm , but often more preoccupied with various love affairs . Chief Maima Arrives ? with Gifts Finally came Maima himself at the head of a retinue of 100 men , all decorated with the most vivid paradise plumes and bearing gifts of food , dead birds , and live pigs slung from poles . In one hand Maima clutched a spear ; in the other , a badly worn soccer ball . I recognized the ball as the one I had given his clan for its help two years before . After we had greeted each other as brothers , I withdrew to our storehouse with smug satisfaction at my forethought . Howls of pleasure greeted the new ball I brought . Promptly I called a meeting of the mountain men . Forming a wide circle about me , they watched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I drew , one after the other , mounted birds of paradise . First I showed them a male Greater bird , faded from its 50 years at the Museum . They shouted its native name , " bounde ! " . Then came the Superb , " kongeral ! " ; the Magnificent , " kombok ! " ; Princess Stephanie 's , " meg ! " ; the Sicklebill , " tomb ? ! " ; the Blue , " goy ! " ; the Grassland Bowerbird , " cell ! " ; and finally the most bizarre of all , the King of Saxony , " kisaba ! " . Next I presented color pictures of themselves and their mountains which had appeared in the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE . Joyfully they passed the pages around , marveling at their own likenesses . Then I explained through my pidgin interpreter that this time I intended not to shoot or purchase birds , but to photograph them in their habitat . Holding up a gold-lip shell ( one of 300 I had ordered from a pearling company on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show me the dance limb of a bounde would receive one shell , the equivalent of seven weeks of labor . I would also give one shell for a King of Saxony and for other varieties of birds of paradise . For a MacGregor 's bird , the price would be three ; we ornithologists knew virtually nothing about this rare creature , not even whether it was a true bowerbird or a bird of paradise . With that , our men vanished into the jungle , 50 strong . The hunt had begun . A few days later the first messengers filtered  | back into camp with stories of discoveries made . I was in the cookhouse one morning when Tai , my No. 1 boy , rushed in to say , " Master , Master , bush Kanaka he talk . He talk talk plenty plenty bounde stop along diwai belong em . Plenty man , e Mary . Singsing morning time true . " ( " Kanaka man says lots of bounde come to his trees . Many males and females go through the noisy courtship dance every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , of course . The following day at dawn I took five men , my cameras , binocular , axes , and emergency cover to the place which the native had spotted . It was a clump of casuarinas two hours ' walk distant , the site of an old native graveyard . From 400 yards away I could hear the highpitched cawing of what seemed to be crows , interspersed with low , repeated growls . In the lacy top limbs a dozen birds flew about excitedly . Crawling through the grass with great caution , I reached the butt of a large tree where I could lie without being seen . Strange Antics of Courtship Looking up , I saw on a limb high above me the most gorgeous bird I had ever laid eyes on ( next page ) . Sunlight breaking through the leaves illuminated his perch , and , against the dark green of the foliage , his flame-colored flank plumes shone like live fire . Slowly he hopped up the branch , dipping his head in a snakelike manner , grasping at little twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his plumes nervously twitching . Then , at the upper end of the limb , he turned sidewise and , like a child jumping with both feet at once downstairs from step to step , he made a series of little leaps down the pencil-size incline to the bottom . Here , suddenly , he raised his wings , lowered his neck in a heronlike crook , and began to thump the wrists of his wings above his back ? rapidly and strongly enough so that I could hear them distinctly 60 feet away . At the same time he cast his plumes upward and backward in a curving spray . The whole rear of his body shook like a feather duster . Two other males flew to limbs near by . One of them dared to land near the display perch itself , only to be charged and driven off by the indignant owner . As for the females , six of them fluttered around within 5 to 50 feet of the dance limb . For the most part , they sat quietly aloof to the male 's antics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and emitted a number of low , burring growls , they flew to perches directly above his gaudy plumes , and even down to a spot beside him . Once , in Australia 's Taronga Zoological Park , I had seen an Emperor of Germany Bird @# of Paradise reach such a peak of ecstasy that he swung head down from his perch like a shimmering pendulum , his plumes cascading from his flanks like fragile white fans . As I watched the Greater bird preening and prancing along his limb , with head low and plumes high , I wondered if he might do the same . And he did . A brilliant ball of plumage , he tumbled forward and swung beneath the perch , luminescent in the morning sun . A female flew to the limb and stood just above him . Reaching up , the male pecked and fenced with her in a kind of continuation of their ritual . Then , as if upon a signal , the dance ended , and all the birds soared off toward a large wooded canyon to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return and capture this unusual dance on film . Thanks to the American Museum and the National Geographic Society , I had been showered with more elaborate equipment than any ornithologist of my acquaintance has ever carried into primitive country . I had been forced , in fact , to train my bearers like an army mortar squad . At the head of my unit I placed a man with my color camera ; attached to it was a reflex housing containing a 400-mm. telephoto lens . Behind him came a bearer with another camera . mounting a 200-mm. telephoto . Both cameras were mounted on ball-socket tripods . Then came six men , each carrying a 35-pound power pack capable of producing a 2,000-volt flash for the speedlights . Next followed men with huge coils of rubber cable with waterproof couplings , an automobile battery , and boxes of extra equipment and film . I had only to sing out , and this platoon fell in with a minimum of confusion ; we were off . Trials and Tribulations Unfortunately , on many occasions we resembled the King of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then marched down again . Nature seemed to conspire against us . Mist formed on our lenses . Persistent rain soaked our power packs ? and detonated them with a shotgun blast that cleared the bush of every bird in the area . Worst blow of all , our electronic lights , on which we had placed such hope , proved tremendously effective scarecrows . We knew well how wary the Greater Bird of Paradise is ? any bird of paradise , for that matter . Yet we had thought that by wiring the dance trees unobtrusively and positioning the lights with care , we could then retreat to our blinds many feet away and obtain photographs of great clarity , taken at 1/5000 of a second . It was not to be . Even though we left the lights in place and went away for weeks at a time , the skittish birds never accepted them .  | Our intentions may have been more honorable or innocent than those of the natives who 11 them with shotgun and bow and arrow , but the birds apparently assumed that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . Our expectations , dashed by this first enunter with the Greater birds , were raised by e addition to our party a fortnight later of , bert Carmet , who has made excellent wildfe movies in Africa and elsewhere . Carmet , it turned out , had been able to take ly S84 with him from France . Yet he had de his way half around the world and arrived on time , in sneakers , to be sure , and not much else , but with cameras that rivaled my own . We began planning a trek into the 12,000-f , iit mountains of the Kubor . Carmet remarked rather testily that the highest he had ever climbed was into the seat of a jeep station wagon , but he exchanged his sneakers for spiked boots willingly enough and , in the early hours of an April morning , our boss boy sang out for a party of bearers . From under my mosquito net I heard the bellowed notes picked up by natives on the other side of the valley and relayed , in dwindling but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Omong Rivers . By 5 a.m. " seven-fella ten men " had assembled outside camp . We loaded these 70 bearers with tents , food , cameras , lights , weapons , and other gear and set off over hilly grasslands through Chief Maima 's province ( page 428 ) . In 10 days we reached the north slopes of the Cambia region , true Stone Age territory . Few natives here had even seen steel . Beside their low little grass huts lay their own tools ? stone axes ground in the age-old manner on a dampened sandstone . White Woman Amazes Natives My wife was the first white woman these people had ever seen . They greeted her with amazement , dancing and howling around her . One huge native , coated with pig grease , hoisted her aloft and carried her through the procession for 20 or 30 yards . Food proved no great problem . In exchange for salt , razor blades , powder paint , and matches , the natives brought us string bags of sweet potatoes , sugar cane , pigs , chickens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods ; yet we noted that they had been able to live without them very well . Fire , for example , they make by plucking a dried vine from their string aprons , threading it through a cleft stick , and sawing it back and forth until , under friction , it breaks into a punklike glow . Salt they manufacture by soaking bundle after bundle of dried grass in salt springs . These are then thrown on the fire and burned . In the ashes a salt cake forms amid the lye . When it is thick enough , they remove it and bind it with others into disks about the thickness of three or four phonograph records . The Kubor people still make most of their decorative dyes and paints from seeds , soft stones , clays , and ashes , but quantities of beads from Czechoslovakia and Italy have filtered into the interior from the coast . We saw scarcely an aborigine who was n't as festooned with beads as a gypsy fortuneteller . Murder in the Stone Age We noted these little encroachments of civilization with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's last pockets of Stone Age people lose its pristine uniqueness , but because , paradoxically , it is the coming of the white man which tends to make the native rapacious . Almost invariably explorers in New Guinea have found the aborigines friendly when first approached . Only after they have become aware of the treasures which the white man carries ? shells and axes and trinkets ? do their thoughts turn to murder and loot . Helmuth Baum , a veteran of many sorties into the interior , died with a Kukukuku stone blade in his skull a few seconds after he had opened his trade box and revealed half a dozen steel axheads . The Leahy brothers ? Michael and Pat ? suffered near-fatal wounds in an attack on their camp in 1931 by natives who had always been quite amicable . Nevertheless , as an ornithologist , I felt that whatever risks I was running among these Stone Age primitives were greatly outweighed by the rare opportunity I had to study New Guinea 's strange birds and people . And in New Guinea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalist is regarded as almost sane . Here the savage is vitally interested in the plants and insects and animals of his region . To him , the white men who come to scratch for yellow metal in his stream beds are the ones who are " long-long " ? crazy . The native , moreover , is as well-informed about flora and fauna as he is interested . Without any sort of written language he manages , nonetheless , to pass on from generation to generation a steadily increasing store of expert knowledge . I did n't find it always easy to believe ; yet when I tested the Kubor people on some particular question , they invariably came through with top marks . For example , a boy wandered into camp with a drab little nest made by a bird which he called a dengalap . I knew that this was a sort of flycatcher rarely seen in the Kubors.  | Yet when I questioned a dozen different natives about the nest , each identified it correctly and without hesitation . It was for this reason that I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our prime objectives in New Guinea : the settling of an old issue among ornithologists as to whether MacGregor 's is a bird of paradise or a bowerbird . The chief difference between the two is that bowerbirds usually clear a bit of ground and build their courtship chambers there , while birds of paradise customarily perform their love dances in trees . Birds of paradise , too , tend to have unusually developed plumes in contrast to the bowerbirds ' short and inconspicuous appendages . We thought we might have the definitive answer when a native who had taken part in our dragnet operation finally brought in a live MacGregor 's . It was an adolescent male and so overwhelmed by being captured that it sat numbly , without protest , as I frantically took portraits of it in color . Yet even after I examined its six curious orange crest plumes , which it can retract into a slot of darker feathers on its crown , I could not say for sure , on this evidence alone , that it was a bird of paradise . Nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another consideration which had a bearing on my decision that this was no bowerbird was that the natives were positive it did not build a courtship chamber on the ground , as do most bowerbirds . Nor could we , in all our searching , ever find such a bird displaying there . As one ornithologist , I am willing to take the verdict of these local experts : MacGregor 's is a bird of paradise ( page 447 ) . Finding the King of Saxony At long last , while we were ransacking the Kubor Range , we caught up with the King of Saxony ( page 444 ) . Margaret and I had finished supper and were sitting by the campfire , huddled against the chill , when we dimly made out a wavering figure coming down the dark forest trail . Presently a gimlet-eyed native , virtually naked , stepped up to the flames , squatted , and began to warm his hands . It was a custom I knew but never wholly relished ; no traveler in these parts is ever denied the hospitality of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can become a little trying to have chaps dropping in and out of one 's hut at any hour of the day or night , helping themselves to " glow-sticks " from the blaze , or just subsiding onto their haunches and staring . This time , however , our irritation quickly evaporated when Tai , my " turn-talk , " informed me , " Dis fella he talk ? kisaba , grass belong em long fella to mas , he stop long hop . " In short , a male King of Saxony Bird of Paradise had been sighted a day 's walk distant . We needed no further urging . Next morning , and for several thereafter , we reconnoitered sodden trails on the flanks of Mount 0-Mar . Finally we hit upon three trees within a mile of each other where various Kings displayed their plumage daily . One of this trio was photographically impossible ; at the second , the bird in residence was molting . So we picked the third and built near it our lofty , ramshackle tower . Thus it was that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avid eyes the sight only one or two white men had ever seen before ? the love dance of the King . In the days that followed , we tried repeatedly to place that spectacle on film . With still pictures we had poor luck ; the problems which had defeated us with the Greater bird vanquished us once more . But with movie film and with sound recordings we succeeded reasonably well . Sicklebill Rattles Like Machine Gun If the King gave us one bird of paradise feather for our caps , other species were just as generous . We photographed more than 100 species , most of them never filmed before . including the rare river duck , Salvadorina , and the little mountain parrot , Psittacella pieta excelsa , which we had discovered in 1950 . Scientists recognize 42 species of birds of paradise ; in New Guinea there are 20 known ornamented species . Of the latter we observed 16 and filmed 12 in color . Particularly entrancing was Blood 's Sicklebill Bird of Paradise ( page 449 ) . We found its mating tree 7,300 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which , one frigid morning , we watched tomba perform . From its perch the Sicklebill would loose a machine-gunlike burst of bass notes . Then . as the sound died away into the cathedra hush of the forest , the bird would begin - drum like a grouse , beating its wings again -t its sides and making loud , cracking repo-twhich quite mystified us . It seemed imp , . - sible that wings alone could make such a fu .. Just as bizarre in a different way was Princess Stephanie 's ( page 449 ) . This bird paradise has a very long black tail , a jewellike head , and a quiet mewing call that is uncannily feline . It displays in trees cloaked in moss and flamboyantly decorated with all manner of ferns , plants , and orchids . Its dance , which we were among the f. - naturalists to see in its wild setting , be with the male slowly picking its way along , a heavily festooned limb .

Result : Where thousands of Blue birds once fluttered and danced in the forests , it is hard now to find a few inbred coveys backed into precipitous cul-de-sacs . One of the most forlorn memories I retain of the island is the spectacle of a male Blue bird I saw at Katumbag , perched on a fire-blackened tree trunk in the heart of a burned-out wilderness . Can anything be done to check these ravages ? Our Australian member thought so . What is needed is a bird of paradise reservation , rather like Africa 's Kruger National Park , in which primitive man can be taught to live side by side in harmony with those treasures of Nature that can be found in New Guinea alone . It would not be too difficult , Bob Doyle pointed out , to administer such an area through the government 's district officers , men well-trained , fair , and much respected by the highlanders .

Hitherto , kombok 's courtship had been observed and fully described by only one white man ? Dr. Austin L. Rand , of the American MuseumRichard Archbold Snow Mountain Expedition. * Altogether , Kaltenthaler , Robert Doyle , and I spent 14 man-days in blinds close to the Magnificent 's dance grounds before we were able to snare the bird 's choreography on film . We felt well rewarded , however , for the antics of this strange bird with its policewhistle voice are among the most intriguing in the bird kingdom .

When all is ready , the male screeches his invitation to those whom it may concern and whirs down upon his sharply slanted stage .

Like a Parisian model he pauses now and again to flaunt his gay apparel . Then he calls once more , circles his tree trunk , and repeats the routine . The Magnificent usually puts on his act in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For audience he can , as a rule , count on one or more females . Drab little things , they land on near-by sticks or even on the outer apron of the stage and squat like lumps , to all outward show aloof and quite uninterested in the patently bawdy exhibitionism of the polygamous male . Male 's Work Is Never Done Turning for a time from birds of paradise , we took a long look at the courtship of the bowerbirds ? particularly Lauterbach 's and the Gardener . The males of these highly specialized species can not always rely on brighter plumage than the female 's to attract her . So some , such as Lauterbach 's , decorate nuptial bowers with colored objects ? red , blue , and green fruits , slate-colored stones , lumps of hardened clay ( pages 450 , 451 ) . Under this sort of regime it is the male who becomes the housekeeper , though the female dominates the actual nest . Lauterbach's. for example , builds his bower typically of some 3,000 twigs and about 1,000 hairlike strands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage . Then he polices it every day of the year , removing debris and replacing the pellet-sized fruits as soon as they begin to fade or decay . The Gardener , which inhabits the cloud forest from 8,500 to more than 9,500 feet . makes his bower in the form of a circlet of moss a yard in diameter , rimmed with a moss wall . In the center he erects a rickety tower of sticks up to three feet tall ( p. 452 ) . Lurking around this chamber much of the day , or fussing inside it , the male Gardener favors females in the vicinity with a disarming serenade of hoarse ventriloquistic notes . He couples this concert with elaborate  |p477  ge-ticulation of his crest plumes , his motions as jittery as a mud wasp 's . We went on to locate three display limbs of the Superb Bird of Paradise and to attempt photographs of its dance ( page 443 ) . But our days were growing short . One morning a runner broke into camp with news , " Dry fella master and misse belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e . " In brief , our expedition leader , Armand nis , and his wife had landed early that rning . They would join us shortly , and we ould drop our ornithological survey for the truing of the Stone Age natives around us . Denis appeared within a few days , and we t out for Katumbag , deep in the Kubor ange . We were , beyond doubt , a cosmolitan crew ? Armand , Michaela , Carmet , b Doyle , Kaltenthaler , Margaret and I. ather Bodnar , and Father John Nilles , a ' zhly trained anthropologist , often joined us . We were , in fact , a United Nations on the march , with Czechoslovakia , Belgium , France , ustralia , Germany , Switzerland , and the ' nited States represented . For most uses rench and English sufficed , but in moments of strain we tended to lapse into pidgin . It n be most expressive . Chief Boma Holds a Sing-sing Our goal was an elaborate sing-sing to be held in the realm of a chief named Boma ( op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his village , ale sounder appeared our news sources , for m the hills around natives were trickling down to the valley , painted and feathered , greased and spruced up for a party . Chief Boma met us affably . No shrinking violet , he more nearly resembled a walking bird of paradise . We contributed some cloth and cellophane to his costume , and Margaret handed his No. 1 wife a mirror ? which he later snatched , giving the poor woman a couple of black eyes in exchange . The preliminary daytime dances proved almost as fascinating as the sing-sing itself . From sunup to sundown three days in a row , platoons of natives pounded the dance arena with their feet , led by a chieftain who intoned a restless , repetitious chant which held all the relentless madness of delirium ( pages 472 and 481 ) . All day long the bare feet tramped and shuffled ; the red , blue , and gold field of paradise plumes nodded and swayed ; the pulsing drumbeats and incessant songs wove a hypnotic spell upon the dancers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oldsters ? gaping and remarking upon one brave 's agility , another 's grandeur . Then came the " long-long " ? the crazy man . Daubed with yellow mud and dead grass , he charged the assemblage like a frantic , twitching , cornered animal . Though he brandished an ax and spear , the children , screaming in delight , followed him in packs . The long-long respected neither age nor sex nor status . He attacked all with the same seemingly murderous inclination . Only the stooges who accompanied him appeared able , in the nick of time , to deflect his weapons as he was about to brain or impale some hapless onlooker . His function was to drive away evil spirits so that the coming sing-sing might be fun for everyone . Meanwhile , the dancers were preparing themselves for the evening performance . Hiding in the forest , they spent hours primping , painting their faces , and inserting their splendid plumes . One man would help another to make up , and , as the final touch , to don his toplofty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests for powder paint . This they applied with patience and artistry to the sides of their foreheads , between ear and eye . As we were shortly to realize , each boy intended to transfer this coloring by contact to the corresponding skin area of his " young fella Mary , " like ink rolled off a printing pad . It was 8 in the evening before we filed at last through an excited , jabbering throng into the long , low sing-sing house . Some 20 by 40 feet in size , this hut had along its sides and across its far end a foot-high dais of woven bamboolike grass . Pig Grease Serves as Perfume The darkness within was lightened somewhat by two small fires . As soon as our eyes had adjusted to the gloom , we saw two young girls kneeling across a narrow aisle from each other . Now others trooped silently in and took their places beside them , about two feet apart , tucking their string aprons modestly between their legs and sitting as immobile and as shiny ? as carved wooden statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An occasional girl had a bamboo musical instrument slung from her neck ( page 434 ) . Others wore crowns of tambu shell , with triangular or diamond-shaped designs in front , while a few sported crowns of cowrie trimmed with golden kapul fur . Many of the girls had bracelets of notched wood ; most had arm bands of woven orchid fiber so tight they were more tourniquet than decoration . All , without exception , had topped their toilette with generous applications of treasured pig grease . Presently , accompanied by a sudden rustling and chattering outside , a line of handsomely decorated men pushed through the hut 's small door and circled the U-shaped formation of  |p478  girls until each stood behind the partner his precedence had allotted him . At a signal , Chief Boma sat down with his back to the aisle , a girl facing him on either side . I noted , to my surprise , that his partners were two attractive and very young belles from Katumbag ; the whole group of girls ranged from about 13 to 17 years . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chant . Louder and louder it rose as the men chimed in and took up the beat . The women remained mute . Gradually , as the music took hold , girls and men began to sway slightly .

Vet , for all the intensity which the particits put into the dance , it retained an inal and agreeable air . Children raced nd the aisles ; old people tossed wood on fire , chuckled and chattered among themes ; and when each bout had ended the broke the tension with a peal of laughter , hievous , gay , infectious ( pages 462 , 463 ) . There is a connection , of course , between girls ' youth and their light-heartedness , a nger one than in most societies . For in Stone Age community the subdebs enjoy freedom they will never know again . They free to go or come . They do no work are much sought after by all the men , ng and old . For two years or three or ten they continue carefree life .

Since the courtship period is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that the right man chooses her . If she is not happy after marriage , she can flee her husband and return to her old home , forfeiting only the original bride payment . And polygamy , while it forces her to share her husband , also forces her fellow wives to share the work . Climax of the dance comes on the last day with a great feast . Pigs , corralled in a special stockade , admired and ogled with much smacking of lips , are now slaughtered by crashing blows on the forehead . Teams of men bleed them , store the inedible fat in gourds for adornment , cut the meat into chunks , and prepare the ground ovens ( page 466 ) . Pork , a la Kubor These ovens are hollowed from the earth itself or from tree trunks . Stones heated on cribs of burning logs are placed at the bottom and interspersed with meat , vegetables , and fragrant leaves . Then water from a bamboo tube , doused on the stones , sends up a head of steam . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reeds , converting the oven into a primitive fireless cooker ( pages 482 , 483 ) . In about an hour and a half the succulent feast is ready . Distribution of the piece de resistance is far from casual . Where many chiefs have gathered , and hundreds or even thousands of pigs have been barbecued , the first chunks go to the headmen . These pass pieces to their lieutenants , often on the tip of an outthrust spear , and they in turn whip out unbelievably efficient bamboo knives and carve morsels for their serfs . The gastronomic orgy may last for days . It sometimes proves fatally wasteful of the tribe 's meat reserves . But at least no part of a pig goes unappreciated . Even the entrails are carefully braided and cooked , and the tusks , hoofs , and bones are preserved for decoration . Men keep the scrotums to wear , skewered , from ear and neck , in the curious faith that they act as aphrodisiacs . Women and old men string varicolored pigtails together for necklaces . Hemmed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon began to feel as if we were attending a college reunion held on a subway at the rush hour . But I made a point of learning as much as I could of the manufacture and the employment of the tool which gives this culture its historic stamp , the stone ax . I had been impressed before with the speed and ease with which a good stone-axman can split casuarina logs , even those a foot or more in diameter ( page 468 ) . The thickness of the blade , I could see , made it possible to strike the log very forcefully without getting it stuck in the wood . But I was unprepared for its sharpness . The blade is razor-keen ? and it holds its edge . Stone for the best of the work axes is quarried from the Jimmi River and at a spot halfway up the Wahgi Valley toward Mount Hagen . But only the old people seem to know how to fashion them into blades . Day after day , one of these old-time craftsmen will sit by a puddle of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blade scrapes forward , turns slightly in the grinder 's hand , clacks against the stone . then scrapes back upon its other edge with a hollow , grating sound . It takes almost three months of constant toil to make a good stone ax , and another week to complete a woven stock and handle for it ( page 486 ) . Other stone implements are not common in the Kubors , but they can still be found ? clubs , knives , emblems , " money , " pestles , mortars , , even carved birds . They are clearly the work of another age . Say the natives , " Em belong before ; me fellow no savvy . " It is easier for the natives to make the elaborate ceremonial axes , with their fla slatelike blades of softer , volcanic chert ( pa 487 ) . It will become easier still for them acquire the steel ax of the white man as visits them with increasing frequency . The Hollow Echo of Prehistory I thought often of that as we turned ba toward Kup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrow trails , we casionally crossed a little valley , and fr some remote pocket in the hills there wo drift down the old , ancestral sound of st upon stone , the clack and scrape , endle repeated , of the axmaker . I hear it yet in my imagination . But will not be many years before the source this frail , fugitive echo will itself be still Then , perhaps , over the whole inhabited gl a music that has been played by primiti man since the dawn of time will resound more , and in those few of us who heard last , the memory will fade . ?
