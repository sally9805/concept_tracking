However , **26;13091;TOOLONG Nunnally Johnson takes the opportunity to give the customers some uptown lowdown , and he dishes it out with chill skill . <P> The dirt : a young girl ( Peggy Ann Garner ) comes to New York on the make to visit her uncle ( Otto Kruger ) , and meets a famous Broadway producer ( Van Heflin ) . Since Heflin 's wife ( Gene Tierney ) is out of town , he rather indiscreetly lets the girl use their apartment to write in while he is at work . The day his wife gets home , they find the girl strung up in the bedroom and a suicide note on the typewriter table . <P> But the police ( George Raft ) discover that the girl did not commit suicide-she was murdered . Furthermore , she was pregnant . Things look bad for the producer . However , there is still the couple upstairs to be considered ( Ginger Rogers and Reginald Gardiner ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Producer Johnson manages very cleverly to keep all these oranges in the air until the next-to-last scene .
