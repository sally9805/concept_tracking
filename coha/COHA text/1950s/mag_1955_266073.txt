In a terse statement the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission last week announced that the Soviet Union had fired another nuclear explosion . Said AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss : " This explosion was the largest thus far in the U.S.S.R .. and was in the range of megatons . The Russian tests indicate an increasingly intensive effort by the Soviet government to develop their nuclear weapons potential . " <P> Three days later , the Soviet foreign ministry confirmed the AEC announcement and revealed a little more . The bomb , said the foreign ministry , was exploded at great height to minimize the radioactive fallout ( radioactive rain fell on Japan last week ) , and was the occasion for research in civil defense as well as in the development of atomic energy . <P> On the same day , speaking at a civic reception in Bangalore . India , Communist Party Boss Nikita Khrushchev added some more information and a helping of propaganda . The experiment , said Khrushchev , used a " minimum " amount of atomic material to create a " maximum " explosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million tons of TNT . " but some Russian reporters insisted that Khrushchev said " more than one million tons . " Then , after announcing that " Russia will never be first to abuse this power . " Khrushchev clapped his hands above his head to lead the applause for his own statement . After the applause he went on : " We shall be glad if these bombs are never exploded over cities and villages . Let them lie . Let them affect the nerves of those who want to unleash war . If someone begins a war , he will get proper answer . " <P> The size that Khrushchev fixed for the new Russian bomb appeared to indicate that it was smaller than some super-bombs the U.S. has exploded . But neither the variation in size nor Khrushchev 's self-applauded statement supplied much comfort to the week 's nuclear news .
