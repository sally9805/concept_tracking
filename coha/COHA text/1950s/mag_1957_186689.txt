On the day he became mayor of Florence six years ago , bustling Giorgio La Pira summoned a city official and announced : " Your only preoccupation will be to employ for the city as many jobless as possible . " When the official uneasily remarked that city funds were already overdrawn , La Pira blithely replied : " This town is dedicated to God . He never worried about money and neither shall we . " <P> True to his word , devout little Giorgio La Pira has kept Florence on the verge of municipal bankruptcy ever since and , in the process , made himself the idol of the Florentine masses . A year ago , largely on the strength of La Pira 's public works , his Christian Democratic ticket won the biggest municipal vote ( 101,000 ) in Florence 's history . But , unhappily for La Pira , the newly adopted proportional representation left the Christian Democrats with only 25 out of 60 seats on the municipal council . La Pira found himself obliged to strike up an unwritten alliance with the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both parties , this alliance survived until the day not long ago when La Pira pressed the council to approve his long-cherished scheme for construction of a " satellite city " which would house 12,000 Florentines who now live either in slums or on the streets . The project aroused the esthetic displeasure of famed Art Expert Bernard Berenson : it would lie on the road to his villa . And it aroused the political wrath of the Social Democrats because of La Pira 's failure to consult them . Faced with the likelihood of a vote of " no confidence , " La Pira resigned as mayor . <P> Many Florentines , possibly including La Pira himself , were convinced that this dramatic gesture would shock the Social Democrats into submission . But when the city council met again last week , the majority of its members proved ready and eager to find another mayor . Unfazed , La Pira pulled another card out of his sleeve : along with 24 Christian Democrats and two right-wing Liberals , he resigned from the council itself . By so doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function and thereby force new elections-elections in which he might hope to win a majority of the council seats . " Have patience , " he told a worried follower . " I am La Pira . Pray for me . God will provide . "
