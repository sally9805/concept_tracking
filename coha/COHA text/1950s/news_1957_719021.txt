txt CIVIL RIGHTS BLOC RALLIES FOR FIGHT TO BAR JURY PLAN Eisenhower Also Said to Be Determined Not to Yield Any Ground on Issue COMPROMISE IS OFFERED 3 Senators Ask Jury Trials for Criminal Contempt Cases in All Fields By WILLIAM S. WHITE Special to The New York Times , WASHINGTON , July 26 ? The Senate 's all-out civil rights forces stiffened their resistance today to any jury-trial provision in the Administration 's bill . President Eisenhower was represented as also determined not to give ground . The bipartisan coalition demanding some form of jury procedure responded by offering a compromise . This would guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt actions  --  not simply in civil rights but also in labor cases and across the whole field of Federal law . The effect was to appeal to the labor leaders and in general to a traditional liberal position against the expansion of the eral injunctive power backed by non-jury enforcement sanctions . Most of the top labor leaders are on record for the civil rights bill ; whether there would be significant defections on the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration 's bill would permit Federal judges , sitting without juries , to fine or imprison persons refusing to obey injunctions to halt actual or threatened deprivation of the voting right . These injunctions could be obtained by Federal prosecutors with or without the consent of the victim . Knowland Forces Firm Senate forces led by Senator William F. Knowland of California , the Republican floor leader , are insisting on the enactment of this section intact . A predominantly Democratia group , with some Republican assistance , is attempting to soften this proviso . Three liberal members of this group , Senators Joseph C. O'Mahoney of Wyoming , Estes Kefauver of Tennessee , and Frank Church of Idaho , put in a proposal to these effects : qTo retain the power of Federal judges to assess penalties , without juries , in cases of civil contempt  --  that is , penalties directed simply to forcing an election official to comply with a court order .

Earlier Plans Modified Under existing law there is no right of jury trial wherever the Government is the complainant . The Administration 's bill was designed with this situation in mind . By having the Government itself intervene in vote cases no jury trial right could be claimed by the defendant under the Administration text .

At this point , now facing punishment that no act of his could avoid , he could demand a jury trial . In the last analysis , according to legal staff experts of the Senate , the decision as to what was a civil and what was crimiinal contempt would be simply the decision of the judge . The essential point is that once he decided it was criminal contempt . version would require considerable further discussion and that the problem of the jury trial forces was not simply to win the test . but to win it " substantially . " The all-out Southern opposition , with which Senator Johnson has broken in his efforts to achieve a compromise bill , decided in a morning caucus to support the **25;1754;TOOLONG amendment but to resist to the end any bill carrying no jury trial guarantee . It seeks to make a clear distinction between civil and criminal contempt in civil rights and all other cases . An Example Is Given refused to register a qualified Negro voter he could be enjoined to do so and put into jail for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the Democrats , Confidential inquiries indicated that as of tonight the pro-jury trial forces had a slight majority of all committed Senators and that about a dozen still uncommitted were being importuned by both sides . Senator Knowland declared his people ready to vote on Tuesday . Senator Johnson , who earlier had indicated a vote by then , now altered his plans to allow the debate to run longer . He told friends that the introduction of the new O'Mahonev he would have to call in a jury to try the case . In practice , according to these experts , criminal contempt would be more likely to occur under the bill for actions involving not mere passive non-compliance with an injunction , say a refusal to enroll a Negro , but to active obstruction of a court order , say a willfulattempt at intimidating a voter after the court had ordered that he be let alone . Penalties Up to Judge The question of penalties also would be largely up to the judge . The **25;1781;TOOLONG amendment would not define penalties for civil contempt , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had been ordered to do . A maximum fine of $1,000 and a maximum imprisonment of six months would be established for criminal contempt . The defendant , say proponents of the approach , could not himself simply bring about a transformation of his case from the civil to the criminal variety and thus assure himself a jury trial . A fear that Southern juries would not convict Southern whites is in the background of the position of the advanced civil rights forces . A man could be held by a judge to be in both civil and criminal contempt , they explain , and his guarantee of the right of jury trial in the latter case would not free him from the first case , negate it or otherwise alter it . As a practical matter , too , they add , a man in civil contempt would hardly be in position to take actions that could involve criminal contempt  --  except , conceivably , to berate and assault the judge before him . Jury trials would be specifically excluded in any case for this sort of obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice . " Senator O'Mahoriey and his associates moved with the knowledge and backing of Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , the Senate Democratic leader . They did so as the lines between the forces supporting and opposing jury trial for criminal , contempt had been drawn tightly at a morning caucus , or conference , of all Republican Senators . Senator Knowland , fresh from a White House breakfast meeting with President Eisenhower , went into the Republican meeting carrying an underlined copy of a Presidential statement of Warning by Russell If that amendment were defeated , said the Southern leader , Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia , the Southerners would fight the bill " with every resource open to us . " He meant that in this eventuality the Southerners would put in the most implacable filibuster of which they were capable . The filibuster is the tactic of deliberately time-killing discussion for the purpose of preventing a vote . A Democratic leader of the all-out cit1l rights coalition , Senator Paul H. Douglas of Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that had been " sprung on " the Senate without warning . His " good friends " from the South , he asserted , had " a guilt complex  --  they are afraid of what will happen to a guilty violator in the South . " Senator Wayne Morse , Democrat of Oregon , another member of this group , told the Senate that " some labor organizations " had attempted to " put the heat " on him to support the jury trial paper . " But here is one liberal , " he added . " who wo n't go along with them . "
