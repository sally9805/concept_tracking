LONDON . R ETIRED colonels were seen sobbing helplessly in their club chairs up and down Pall Mall one Wednesday last July when Punch was out with a new face . Since India 's separation from the Crown , nay , since the abdication of King Edward VIII , nothing had been quite so unsettling . Was this still the cozy old Punch appearing in a slightly less Victorian guise or , sir , was this a cheap , insidious imitation of the newfangled American style ? The debate , at this writing , is still raging . To be sure , England 's great humorous weekly still uses the familiar cover designed by Artist Dicky Doyle in 1899 when Punch was a mere brat of eight . But there 's new varnish even on that 100-year-old masterpiece  --  gone are the two strips of advertising , and what you buy on the newsstand no longer announces , " I Want Cadburys ! " but clearly , " Punch . " Furthermore , there are suspicious splashes of red on the puppet 's hat and on the collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages no longer seem as cluttered up as grandma 's front . parlor ; there 's more white space , a neater arrangement of the type and newly styled headlines . Articles are signed , rather than mysteriously initialed  --  a historic innovation preceding the face-lifting job by a few weeks  --  and there 's even a news feature describing some event or other which took place not last year , but last Sunday . Far from being a lowly medium of what passes for entertainment in these isles , Punch is a British institution , a sacred trust not to be monkeyed with any more than , say , the bronze lions on Trafalgar Square . For 108 years , it has bemused  --  and sometimes amused  --  its public with humorous drawings , jokes , quips , light verse and short pieces of prose . Ever since people can remember , anyone making a witty remark has been told , " Send it to Punch , " and not even socialized medicine has been able to take Punch out of the British doctor 's waiting room . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1947 ? that a copy of Punch is read by more people than any other British periodical ; with 13.5 readers per copy , Punch leaves the runnerup , Picture Post , a panting second , with a measly 7.4 . This means that the 170,000 copies of Punch sold each week are eagerly devoured by 2,295,000 people  --  quite a slice of the United Kingdom 's 50 , - 000,000 population . More than that , Punch is one of the bonds keeping the empire together . " Aunt Mavis on Belgrave Square , " the editors point out , " always sends her copy on to Cousin John in Kenya , and Cousin John , likely as not , will send it to his sister-in-law in Hong Kong . " Saddled with global responsibilities , the manipulators of the little blockhead know what 's expected of them . Whatever new paint they may splash on him , Mr. Punch must always keep the mellow disposition which has endeared him to generations of readers . He must remain the impeccable little gentleman who never swears , never mentions sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never cracks a joke about false teeth . He must n't try to he smart or slick , must n't go high-brow or high-hat . Sophistication is not his line . Punch must always be Punch . " Tradition is master here , " states sixty-two-yearold Cyril Kenneth Bird , raised from art editor to editor on April 1 , 1949 . " We submit to it cheerfully and we have no intention of ever going against it . " . . PUNCH OFFICE , says the bronze sign at No. 10 Bouverie Street . A shiny statue of the long-nosed hunchback giving the magazine its name grins down from above the entrance of the country-style , fourstory brick building . Situated just a few paces from the corner of Fleet Street , London 's bustling newspaper row , and facing the monstrous , droning plant of the News of the World , the world 's largest newspaper , the Punch Office retains a coolly aloof , unhurried atmosphere . A softly curving stairway takes you up to the oak-paneled , carpeted suite of offices where Punch is put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in the hectic pleasures of literary creation . The editorial crew consists of five sedate gentlemen , none of whom is in the habit of putting in a full week 's work at the office . In addition to Editor Kenneth Bird , they are Literary Editor H. F. Ellis , a forty-two-year-old Oxford graduate who also serves as Punch 's staff reporter ; Bernard Hollowood , his assistant , a former economics teacher and an author of learned books ; Film Critic Richard Mallett , who goes to the movies " hoping to enjoy them " ; and Art Editor Russell Brockbank , a Canadian from Niagara Falls . As only two or three working days find all the editors together , their somewhat haphazard teamwork might not always result in a completed issue of Punch at the appointed time were it not for the admirable Miss Wood , secretary to the editor and Punch 's guardian angel , who keeps the files , reminds the boss of anniversaries which might inspire a Punch drawing and , generally , knows all the answers . Kenneth Bird , better known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first Punch editor to express himself in images rather than words . All of his six predecessors were distinguished men of letters  --  playwrights , poets , novelists . But if their names had been known largely to the literaryminded , Fougasse is a darling of the milling masses . His figures , drawn with a unique economy of line ? much the way a canary would draw if he could ? seem to squirm and wriggle , bounce , skip and run , while you 're looking on , and are about as easy to ignore as a bug in your ear . To the British public , memories of World War II are forever tied up with Bird 's series of eight humorous wartime posters warning against careless talk and featuring a couple of innocents gabbing away ? while Hitler hides under the table and Goering rides along in the luggage rack of the railroad compartment . Princess Elizabeth was merely voicing a popular sentiment when she remarked , on opening a recent exhibition of humorous art in London , " How carelessly we should have talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deep belief in the essential goodness of man , Fougasse confronts the universe with a face of unruffled kindliness . Utterly at peace with the world and with himself , he finds it impossible to put on airs . The door of his corner office remains open at all times and his editorial salary of ? 5000 a year does n't interfere with his PHOTOGRAPHY HY VICTOR JORGENSEN twelve-year-old habit of lunching on a sandwich prepared by his wife . You would n't know , in meeting him casually , that both his smile and his art were acquired the hard way . Born the son of a well-off London wine merchant , Bird was trained as an engineer . As an army engineer during World War I , he was a member of Britain 's ill-fated landing force at Gallipoli . A piece of Turkish shrapnel fractured his spine  --  the doctors held out little hope . It was his wife Mollie who , watching over his recovery in the seclusion of a Scottish country house , patiently nursed him back to health . To occupy himself during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up drawing . To this day , his figures are on a small scale  --  the way a man draws most conveniently when lying on ' his back . Punch accepted his first drawing in 1916 . Because another artist named Bird was working for Punch at the time , he signed himself Fougasse ? a funnysounding slang term for an obsolete land mine he remembered from his engineering textbooks . For the next ten years he supported himself as a free lance . When Punch , in 1937 , invited him to become its art editor , he was already established as one of the leading humorous artists of his time . Today , in spite of his administrative duties , he continues to draw for Punch  --  without extra pay . " The cartoonist carries weapons stronger than himself , " says Fougasse . " Far more people can read a drawing than a line of prose . Now , an artist who does n't like the prime minister would be tempted to portray him , say , with a ( i.:01 , tinned on Page 116 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 27 ) tail and long ears . Soon enough , people would think of the prime minister as an ass . That would hardly be fair , would it ? Punch was founded on a deepseated trust in human nature  --  even when we deal out rebukes , we never mean any harm . " Every Wednesday noon , in keeping with a tradition started in the early life of Mr. Punch , twelve wise and presumably witty men meet for lunch in the second-floor dining room of the Punch Office reserved for the occasion . They take their seats around the oval pine table immortalized , poetically though incoiieutly , as " the mahogany tree " by an early staff member , William Makepeace Thackeray . And although such standard menus as turtle soup , turbot and venison have long been replaced by a more austere diet , Messrs . Ring &; Brymer , famed caterers to the Lord Mayor of London , still do their best . From Punch 's own cellar come the deep-red Burgundy , the rare old brandy , which will raise the conversation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by the owners of Punch is a privilege granted for life ; a man is looked over carefully before he 's asked to join , and you may be on the editorial staff or on the list of stand-by contributors for years before receiving the call . Consequently , the Punch luncheon is about as exclusive a gathering as you can find in the world of letters today . Among the few irregulars ever honored with an invitation to one of Punch 's banquets were Charles Dickens  --  whose only contribution was rejected by Punch  --  and Mark Twain . Present members , in addition to Fougasse , who presides at the head of the Table , are Punch Publisher Alan G. Agnew , and Peter , his son ; Editors Ellis , Hollowood and Mallett , and Book Critic E. 0 . D. Keown ; E. G. V. Knox , who retired as Punch editor last April ; Star Contributor A. P. Herbert ; and Artists George Morrow , Ernest Shepard and L. G. Illingworth . But this is no mere social gettogether . On the contrary , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the luncheon is to find a subject , for the magazine 's No. 1 editorial feature , the weekly cartoon . When coffee is served and the two waiters have tiptoed out , the editor calls the meeting to order . What now takes place is one of the most remarkable efforts of collective thinking ever attempted in the journalistic field . After Fougasse has submitted his own suggestions and the others have thrown their ideas into the pot , the fireworks begin  --  with most of those present , regardless of their pictorial abilities , sketching wildly on their note pads . " See what I mean ? " The language , though sometimes spirited , remains parliamentary throughout . It 's " I 'm afraid this wo n't do , " never " This stinks . " Agreement is reached , as a rule , by four o'clock , but within the memory of those living , no formal vote has ever been taken . For example , last July , when the dire implications of Britain 's dollar crisis were not yet realized by everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wolf , someone suggested , would admirably symbolize the crisis . Yes , said the next man , some chap crying , " Wolf , wolf , " and then the real wolf appearing out of nowhere . Some chap ? The British Government ! EVENING POST Sir Stafford Crippa , Chancellor of the Exchequer ! That 's it , Cripps yelling , " Wolf , " and then ? Wait a minute , gentlemen . Would n't that rather cramp Sir Stafford 's style ? We may not like the Labor Government , but he 's still the best man on the team . Right ; let 's not do it that way . But the wolf should stay in , anyway , and a lot of sheep , too . . . . The upshot of two hours of hot debating was one of the strongest cartoons Punch has featured since the war . It showed a colossal wolf labeled " Disaster " stalking several flocks of blissfully unconcerned little sheep toting signs with such selfish-sounding slogans as " More Luxuries , " " More Money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Socialist sheep , evidently , for the big black wolf was threatening the nation as a whole . L. G. Illingworth , a friendly , leatherfaced Welshman , blocks out the composition on his note pad and next day presents the editor with the finished drawing ? never a masterpiece by artistic standards , but photographically correct down to the last hair . Of all the drawings appearing in Punch , only Illingworth 's weekly contribution is known as " the cartoon . " Mr. Punch takes some pride in the fact that the term , as applied to a humorous drawing with political barbs , was coined by him ; the word merely denoted an artist 's rough sketch for a painting until Punch , back in 1843 , published its own version of " cartoons " for some projected murals in Parliament . Punch cartoons , through the years , have been penned by some fine draftsmen , among them Sir John Tenniel , illustrator of Alice in Wonderland ; Sir Bernard Partridge , Cartoonist Laureate for half a century ; and Ernest Shepard , illustrator of A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embellish Punch 's poetry pages . Punch 's most famous cartoon , to this day , is that entitled Dropping the Pilot . Appearing in 1890 , it showed Germany 's chancellor , Bismarck , slowly descending the ship'a ladder while the young Kaiser , who had sacked the trusted statesman , looked down from the deck . A plain , pedantic drawing , it nevertheless seems to foreshadow the sinister course the Kaiser 's ship would take . Bismarck , through an English friend , acquired the original , while the Kaiser , when Germany and England went to war , put a price on the Punch editor 's head . During World War I , Punch 's cartoon Unconquerable , in which the Kaiser told the King of the Belgians , " So , you see  --  you 've lost everything , " and the King replied , " Not . my soul , " was widely acclaimed as " the greatest picture of the war . " It became the subject of sermons in many churches , including St. Paul 's Cathedral . Reproduced in color , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of a more recent vintage , few Punch readers will forget the drawing in which the Czech maiden is jerked in through an iron door by a huge bear 's paw or Punch 's superb comment on Soviet diplomacy , showing the bear , resplendent in a diplomat 's uniform , savagely howling across a conference table , his hind leg stepping through a piece of paper labeled " Agreement . " Founded back in 1841 by Mark Lemon and two other British journalists in frank imitation of a then highly successful French comic paper , Charivari , Punch made his entry as a crusader . Crusades were in the air . The evils of the Industrial Revolution were rampant everywhere , cities were foul with slums , agitation for workers ' January 21t ? 1950 108 years of its existence the weekly has printed many jokes that would not be considered a laughing matter in the United States ; but then , the difference between humor and humour has long been a subject of research and analysis on both sides of the Atlantic  --  so far without conclusive results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered very funny in its own bailiwick . It was W. S. Gilbert , of Gilbert and Sullivan fame , who asked Punch Editor Francis Burnand whether he was getting a lot of jokes in his mail and , when Burnand said he did , asked him why he did n't print some of them in Punch . Still , Punch humor is as British as cold mutton , and if the editors maintain that most of the readers do laugh at most of the jokes , they 're probably not far off the mark . Among Punch witticisms which have become milestones of British humor are Punch 's " Advice to Persons about to Marry  --  Do n't ! " And the Scotsman 's complaint about his trip to London : " Mun , a had na been the-er-re abune Twa Hoours when ? Bang  --  went Saxpence ! ! " Typical , too , of early Punch humor were such dead-pan dialogues as : Right Reverend Host : I 'm afraid You 've got a bad egg , Mr. Jones ! The Curate : Oh , no , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent ! Or this : Jones : Hul-lo , Handley , old boy ! Have n't seen you for an age . Come along and have a drink ! Total stranger ( turning around ) : I 'm afraid I 'm not Handley , but  --  er ( wistfully ) might I have his drink ? In recent issues , Punch 's Charivaria page , featuring purportedly humorous quips , carried these tear-jerkers : Mr. Molotov is said to refuse caviar whenever it is offered . A possible reason is that he fears that it might agree with him . A newspaper is taking a vote to find out the class of person that lives longest . Our guess is centenarians . The protruding roots of a famous old oak in a London park were struck by lightning and badly damaged . Nobody had warned them , apparently , about the risk of sheltering under a tree . Convinced that the funniest thing in England is the English , Punch uses up a good deal of space venting the prejudice . From its early days , it has looked with amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentry and their butlers . Such British foibles as fox hunting , cricket matches and walking tours have been a source of never-ending mirth . Around 1936 , this attitude crystallized into a series of drawings on the British Character containing some of the choicest bits of self-ribbing since the appearance of The Spectator more than 200 years before . That inscrutable individual , the British subject , was shown sharing a railroad compartment without striking up a conversation , sitting glumly through a formal dinner , taking a passionate interest in dogs and the weather , being rude to foreigners and looking down his nose at intellectuals . Drawn by " Pont " ? Graham Laidler ? a promising young artist , the series proved most popular . When World War II broke out , Pont turned to recording John Bull 's day-to-day agony , and Britons , having so little to laugh about , would take a copy of Punch along on b iiiar ; raid warden 's duty to . laugh at mselves . During the height of the Pont showed a man calmly en=Ng. in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with excellent manners and doubtful means of support , have been heard to remark , " Why should I work ? I 've done nothing wrong " ; Rowland Emett , self-appointed Honorary Chairman of Improbable Railways , whose toy locomotives and bric-a-brac rolling stock , occupied by dignifiedlooking travelers , chug on through fairy-tale landscapes ; and twenty-nineyear-old Ronald Searle , Punch 's only major postwar discovery , whose care . natures of actors and actresses are prized as gems of human observation by Editor Bird . Some of these artists are unrepentant sophisticates who state that reading Punch , to them , " is about as amusing as reading a cracker , " and place their drawings with that magazine only because it pays the highest price obtainable . Most of them also draw for other periodicals , dabble in advertising and turn out art for art 's sake in their free time . Punch prices range , from five guineas for a drawing sent in by a beginner to the forty-five guineas paid each week to Illingworth for the political cartoon . On the manuscript side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive  --  something written for Punch , as every literaiy agent will tell you , is written for Punch and , if rejected , becomes a hopeless proposition . Punch will pay anything from seven to twenty guineas for a prose effort of 1000 words or so ; twenty-five guineas for a full-length piece filling a couple of printed pages is top rate . Both text and cartoons are covered by copyright and may be reproduced only by permission of the proprietors . Mr. Punch 's tact and loyalty prevent him , as a rule , from telling an old-timer he 's slipping . As a result , Punch employs at least one aged artist who admittedly has n't had a single idea in years , but gets his weekly suggestion out of the mailbag . And if there 's dead wood in Punch 's prose and poetry departments , it 's tended with the same loving care as the greener shoots  --  to the delight of Punch readers at home and abroad .

" Sir Alan is such a well-known person , " one inveterate reader explains . " He 's fought so many crusades ? for better divorce laws , for better English , for less noise made by airplanes , and many of them in the columns of Punch . Punch would n't be the same without him . " Likewise , only a cad would dream of suggesting the less frequent appearance of Evoe ? E. G. V. Knox , a contributor since 1906 and editor from 1932 to 1949 , whose learned parodies and satires , thick with obscure classical references , are among the basic Punch ingredients that must n't be tampered with . Just the same , even the seemingly immortal Mr. Punch has his moments of nostalgia during which he 'd like to be , once again , the saucy , irreverent , charmingly indignant Punchinello of his early days . Having long ago changed from a rouser of public sentiment to a smiling recorder of Britain 's upper-class mind , he occasionally feels the urge to recapture his buoyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and then , the way we used to in the past , " sighed one member of the Punch Table . 2 " The question is : On whose behalf ?
