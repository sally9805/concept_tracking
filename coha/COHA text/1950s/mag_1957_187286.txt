" I 've got a secret , " crowed Purdue Coach Jack Mollenkopf . " I 'll say no more . " He did n't have to . Whatever his secret was , it touched off a fire under his injury-ridden Boilermakers . Sophomore Quarterback Ross Fichtner , starting his first game , called his shots like a pro ; Fullback Bob Jarus was a one-man wrecking crew . Between them , they clanged out a 20-13 victory over the top-ranked Spartans of Michigan State . <P> As if to confuse the Big Ten further , underrated Illinois salvaged a hospitalized halfback named Bob Mitchell , and turned him loose against high-riding Minnesota . Result : Illinois 34 , Minnesota 13 . <P> Overzealous officials carried the ball more than the players as Maryland and North Carolina lazed through the first quarters of their game before the royal visitors , Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip . Then the Maryland boys remembered their duty as hosts , put on an impressive show to upset the Tarheels 21-7 . <P> Army 's Black Knights were supposed to have a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the game . After that they got rolling and wrecked the Panthers 29-13 . <P> Unbeaten Princeton figured to be three touchdowns 0better than Colgate . By the time the first half ended the Tigers seemed capable of turning back the Red Raiders with their third team . Instead , they turned too polite for words and fumbled away the game 12-10.
