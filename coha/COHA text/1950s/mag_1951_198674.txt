In the next four years , more than $21 billion in Government war bonds ( Series E ) will be due for payment . To prevent a drain on the Treasury and keep the cash from adding to inflation , Treasury Secretary John Snyder last week came out with a plan . Its nub : encourage people to hold on to their E bonds by continuing the interest after maturity . If they keep the bonds for ten more years , they will collect an average annual interest of 2.9% . As an alternative for those who want to collect on their bonds every year , Snyder would permit them to convert their E bonds to G bonds , which pay 1% interest every six months . At week 's end a bill was sent to Congress to write the plan into law .
