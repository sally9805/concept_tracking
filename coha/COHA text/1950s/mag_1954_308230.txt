Dear Time-Reader <P> In the newspaper-and magazine-publishing businesses , our bureau of standards is an organization called the Audit Bureau of Circulations . Every important publication in the U.S. that carries advertising and has a paid circulation is a member of the A.B.C . As its name indicates , the bureau is the authority on correct circulation figures . This month the A.B.C . is celebrating its 40th anniversary . <P> Before the bureau was organized , true figures on a publication 's circulation were seldom available . Probably the first attempt to get an impartial audit of a publication 's circulation was back in 1847 , when the New York Tribune challenged the New York Herald as to which had the larger circulation . The rival publishers finally selected two impartial judges to settle the controversy , and the judges went to work on their audit . Their method : a careful count of the amount of newsprint used by each paper over a four-week period . When the count was completed , circulation title went to the Herald , on the ground that it had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> This kind of test would satisfy nobody today-least of all the advertiser , who has a right to know accurately how much circulation he is receiving for his investment in advertising . <P> In the undisciplined days of rough-and-tumble publishing , many publishers were reluctant to open their books for audit . A further difficulty lay in the fact that there was no standard bookkeeping and auditing method in the publishing business . Groups of advertisers and their agents organized and continued to push for accurate circulation figures and a uniform method of presenting them . <P> Gradually , publishers realized that the practice of audited circulation would be as beneficial to them as to advertisers , and in 1914 the Audit Bureau of Circulations was launched to verify circulation claims on a basis of uniform standards . Membership was voluntary and consisted of publishers , advertisers and their agencies . The first year there were 612 members . This month , 40 years later , the roster of A.B.C . members is 3,554 ( 673 advertisers , 192 agencies and 2,689 publishers ) . <P> In making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained certified public accountants , are given full access to a publication 's circulation records . Then they verify these records by independent research . Records of both newsstand and subscription sales are studied and checked . Newsdealers ' sales are tabulated , and deductions made for unsold copies . Subscription lists are checked and methods of selling subscriptions are noted . <P> When the audit is finished , the publication 's total circulation is then posted in a detailed annual A.B.C . report , which not only shows the quantity of the circulation and its distribution , but also the methods used to get that circulation . <P> The Audit Bureau of Circulations has , in fact , become an indispensable factor in modern newspaper and magazine publishing . The late Senator and Publisher Arthur Capper of Kansas once described the A.B.C . this way : " . . . The only institution in America in which the producer and the consumer , the manufacturer and the customer , the seller and the buyer have voluntarily sat down together and have cooperated , harmoniously and with good feeling , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
