At . 72 , modernist Composer Ernest Bloch is resigned to the fact that he is quite an old man . He lives in semi-retirement at Agate Beach , Ore. , gathering and polishing beach stones , gardening and caring for his mushrooms . He still composes regularly , but has unwrapped no major scores since his Concerto Symphonique three years ago . " I am no giant of a man like 78-year-old Winston Churchill , " he says . <P> But last week Manhattan heard a new chip off the old Bloch , his String Quartet No. 3 . It had much of the modernist vigor audiences have come to expect from Ernest Bloch , but listeners also caught a new air of mellowness and reflection . <P> Part of the mellow effect came from the devoted performance by London 's Griller Quartet , for which Bloch wrote the piece . It had its angry trills and thudding undertones , yet over the harshness always rode an affirmative melody . " It is quite natural that I do not react and feel and write as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young , " says Bloch . <P> Composer Bloch was uncertain about the reception of his quartet when the Grillers played it for him two months ago , but he need not have worried . The audience thoroughly approved , and the New York Times 's Olin Downes called it the " strongest , the most concentrated and the most spiritually mature production of his lifetime . " Bloch was not so sure : " I can not say if it is my best quartet . <P> Do you prefer a turkey or a duck ? " In any event , Bloch was not ready to let the quartet stand alone as the only testament of his 72nd year . After finishing the quartet ( in April ) , he wrote Concerto Grosso No. 2 for Strings and String Quartet ( August ) a Sinfonia Breve ( December ) and a brief In Memoriam ( also December ) . At week 's end , with an energy that Churchill might applaud , he was off to Rome to hear a revival of his 1910 opera , Macbeth .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
