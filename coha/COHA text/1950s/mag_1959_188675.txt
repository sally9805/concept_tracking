THE FABULOUS SHOWMAN ( 317 pp. ) - Irving Wallace-Knopf ( $5 ) . <P> It might be fitting if , at the time of their greatest embarrassment , the high-salaried humbuggers of TV were to observe a moment of noise in honor of Phineas Taylor Barnum . They might take comfort from the information that the old Bridgeport fraudmonger left an estate of $4,100,000 after a lifetime of ballyhooing fakes ( and fakes of fakes ; he once counterfeited the counterfeit fossilized Cardiff giant ) . Network presidents might reflect that Barnum would not have had fits of contrition ; he would have locked his found-out quislings in a cage , tacked up a sign saying " This Way to Regress " and charged admission at 25 ( plus inflation ) a head . <P> Unfortunately the first Barnum biography ( for adults ) in several decades is as spotty as the conscience of its subject . Author Wallace owes something of his prose style to the titles of Valentino films ( " Unashamedly , Barnum wept . But then came the dawn " ) . Not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of the " Fabulous Showman , " the author presents little but the show . Still , the highlights of that show are there as Phineas , son of a Connecticut farmer-storekeeper , moves from attraction to attraction-the white whale , Soprano Jenny Lind , General Tom Thumb , Commodore Nutt , the Negro who claimed he could turn black skin into white , and all the others . <P> The man William Lyon Phelps was to call " the Shakespeare of advertising " discovered that he could get as much free publicity by confessing himself a fraud as he could by trumpeting that a hoked-up mermaid was real . New Yorkers crowded into his museum to be outraged when the news spread that a bugled model of Niagara Falls was only 18 inches tall ; they crowded more after a spectator , probably with Barnum 's connivance , filed a lawsuit to test the femininity of the bearded lady ( she was shown to be soundly female ) . <P> Behind the promoter 's checked vest was an enigmatic man who preferred good music , or said he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and then , in a town 's quick change , became a steam-driven temperance lecturer . Biographer Wallace mentions briefly Barnum 's political career-he served in the Connecticut legislature and for a year was a reform mayor of Bridgeport , possibly his greatest fraud of all . Readers may be disappointed to learn that nowhere is there any record that Barnum made his legendary crack , " There 's a sucker born every minute . " The phrase must have been invented by some obscure fraud who palmed it off on Barnum , in a gesture of poetic justice .
