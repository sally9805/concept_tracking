Appointment in Honduras ( RKO Radio ) is a problem picture . The problem : if Ann Sheridan , with nothing on her back but some translucent yellow nightclothes , is abandoned in a Central American jungle with six hot-blooded men , can the material sustain the stress of the situation ? <P> One of the six , it is true , is Ann 's husband ( Zachary Scott ) , but he is a weakling , and probably could n't even uphold her shoulder strap in an argument . Four others , escaped convicts , are led by a hard-breathing type ( Rodolfo Acosta ) whose fondness for silk has nothing to do with its denier . Only the sixth man ( Glenn Ford ) can keep him from fingering the stuff , because only Ford knows the way through the jungle to safety from the agents of a revolutionary junta who are dashing in pursuit . <P> Day after day the six men and a girl wander through what is palpably the largest number of potted palms ever assembled on one set . Thorns slash at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colony of ants almost eats it off her back one night , even a crocodile comes up for a nibble . However , just as Actress Sheridan seems about to violate the Production Code , up steps Actor Ford to offer her his shirt and a spare pair of pants . <P> Up to that point , the picture has at least the charm of a kind of exotic silliness-rather like finding the underwear section of the Sears Roebuck catalogue floating gravely along the upper Orinoco . <P> Genevieve ( Rank ; Universal-International ) comes under the heading of Very Special Jokes-even among the British , who made it . It may thus be assumed that the large U.S. movie public , which dislikes esoteric humor and is leary of many British brands , is not going to laugh itself hoarse at this one . But to some , e.g. , the sort of people who understand that the passion for antiques is a bit silly but go on collecting them anyway . Genevieve will come as an irresistible little piece of comic bric-a-brac . <P> The subject of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brighton , of the British Veteran Car Club . The heroine is an alizarin-crimson 1904 Darracq named Genevieve , the hero an anonymous cadmium-yellow 1904 Spyker . The Darracq is the proud possession of a young man of moderate means ( John Gregson ) . His wife ( Dinah Sheridan ) just goes along grimly for the ride . The Spyker belongs to a friend named Ambrose ( Kenneth More ) , a frisky youth whose ambition it is " to combine the pleasures of the London-Brighton run with a really beautiful emotional experience . " <P> For this purpose , Actor More invites on the spin a flashy young brunette ( Kay Kendell ) who. after a number of frantic breakdowns ( " Better try a new flint ! " hollers a passing motorist ) , begins some calculated conversation with Gregson 's wife . " All Ambrose seems to think about are that silly old car and the other thing . " The wife answers bleakly , " My husband only thinks of the car . " <P> In Brighton at last , while watching More crank up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wonder darkly , " What happened on the ' 49 run ? " when his wife , before they were married , made the trip in the yellow Spyker . His discontent takes the form of a belligerent insistence that his car is better than the other , and the two soon rooster each other into a race back to London , with the rash sum of 100 riding on the outcome .
