" It was just another day of racing for me , " said banana-nosed Eddie Arcaro after he piloted the C.S.T. Stable 's big gelding Ban to an easy victory at Santa Anita . But for the record books it was something special : Arcaro 's 4,000th victory in 27 years of riding . Only Veteran Jockey Johnny Longden ( 5,092 ) and Britain 's retired Sir Gordon Richards ( 4,870 ) ever brought more winners home . Argentina 's Alex Miteff leaked so much blood from his flattened nose during a ten-round scrap with Cuba 's Nino Valdes that the crowd almost had the illusion of a good heavyweight fight . But even before Miteff got a split decision , it was plain that there is still no one in sight to take on Champion Floyd Patterson . To make matters worse , European Champ Ingemar Johansson knocked out Britain 's Joe Erskine in 13 rounds at Gothenburg , Sweden , and spoiled a Patterson-Erskine match that Floyd 's manager Cus D'Amato was prepared to palm off as a title fight . British Housewife Kathleen Brockwell based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary date and family birthdays , backed her hunches with bets of only tuppence , and last week won 206,028 ( $576,878 ) tax free , biggest payoff ever made in one of the world 's biggest gambling games .
