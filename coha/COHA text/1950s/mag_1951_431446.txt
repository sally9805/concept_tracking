 | Few gifts are more acceptable and suitable to almost everyone than money . But the impersonality of a cash offering sometimes keeps it from being entirely satisfactory to either giver or receiver . The woman who receives a check or cash for Christmas may , in a moment of emergency , spend it on groceries instead of the silk petticoat or the high-heeled slippers sihad promised herself . And if she does n't get around to replacing the money out of her household funds , she feels faintly aggrieved , or deprived by the giver of her rightful due . The giver , on the other hand , may feel he has taken the easy way out , having expended minimum effort on his offering . Although his money gift may far exceed what he might have spent on a gimcrack , he probably will not experience the same pleasure in giving it .
