txt Joe C. Loon , a young university lecturer , was the proudest man in Cape Town this weekend . He was the first man in South Africa to sight the United States satellite Explorer . And in the absence of data from the satellite tracking headquarters at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge , Mass. , there is considerable speculation here as to whether or not he is the first man in the world to pinpoint the satellite accurately by optical tracking . One of the 40-man " moon-watch " team at Cape Town 's Royal Observatory , which has been scanning the skies since the American satellite was launched Jan. 31 , Mr. Loon saw the satellite take a three-second . flip across the lens of his five-inch United States Navy telescope at 2 hours 54 minutes a.m . Greenwich Mean Time the morning of Saturday , Feb. 8 . South Africa is one of the key satellite tracking stations , being the first in the satellite 's path after its firing from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , and the moonwatching team has been keeping an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . As soon as the satellite ? " like a shooting star but maintaining a constant even course " ? appeared in the bottom half of his telescope lens Mr. Loon yelled out , " Here it comes . " And then as it crossed the designated line on his telescope he called " Pip , " the signal for stopwatches to click and for the position , height , and time for the sighting to be flashed over teleprinter at the observatory direct to Cambridge , Mass . Later at his apartment in the Cape Town suburb of Rosebank , Mr. Loon , an amateur astronomer by night and a lecturer in land surveying at the University of Cape Town by day , told this correspondent , " I had been watching so long I was beginning to doubt whether the Americans had really put up a satellite . Now I know it 's up there . "
