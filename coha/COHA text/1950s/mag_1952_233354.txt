As a man already dedicated to a lifetime of playing Dixie on the human spine , slim , soft-spoken Victor Meyers gave little thought to worldly matters during 1921 ; at that point he was about to graduate from the Riley School of Chiropractic in Washington , D.C. , and to go forth seeking his first sacroiliac . Consequently , when a fraternity brother named Bert offered to wise him up , he listened appreciatively . " You ought to move to Virginia , " said Bert . " They do n't pay any federal taxes over there . You only have to pay ' em if you live in the District or work for the Government . " <P> The new doc followed Bert 's advice . He opened an office in Washington , but when he got married he bought a house across the Potomac in Arlington County . He paid Virginia state income taxes , and , in fact , eventually became a good friend of the state tax collector . When one of his daughters grew up and began filing federal income tax returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years , Chiropractor Meyers never paid a cent of federal income tax himself . Bert 's misinformation had " cocooned " in his mind . <P> At least , that is what the doc said when an income-tax agent dropped into his office a few months ago , and interrupted his three decades of bliss by asking to see his income-tax returns for 1948 , ' 49 and ' 50 . <P> " Certainly , " the doc said , reaching for a drawer full of state income-tax forms . <P> " I do n't mean those , " the agent said . " I mean federal tax returns . " <P> <P> " Oh , I do n't have to pay federal taxes , " said Meyers smugly . " I live in Virginia . " <P> " People in Virginia have to pay federal income taxes too , " the agent assured him . For a dreadful moment it was so quiet in the office that you could hear a tendon snap . " You 're kidding , " gasped the doc . But everyone thought the doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own lawyer suggested that his story was " fantastic . " The judge cried " Preposterous ! " and fined him $5,000 . <P> Even worse , the Bureau of Internal Revenue asked the doc for back taxes . The T-men calculated that he owed them $22,000 . At week 's end , the doc was still protesting that he had committed no fraud . " I think the Government is partly to blame . . . " he cried . " Why did they let me go on like this for 30 years , anyway ? "
