What is the leading cause of alcoholism nowadays ? Not the sordid living conditions that once led to " Gin Lane , " say the editors of the British Medical Journal , but hangovers of old-fashioned Puritanism . " In Shakespeare 's time , " editorializes the Journal , " there were Puritans who condemned drinking out-and-out , and Falstaff is eloquently scornful of them : ' Nor a man can not make him laugh ; but that 's no marvel , he drinks no wine . ' <P> " Yet it is in the regions most dominated by the Puritan ethic that alcoholic excess appears most pronounced . Where the social group withdraws its approval from drinking , it becomes either a solitary vice or a wickedness covertly shared with a few boon companions . This type of alcoholism is allied not so much to poverty as to conflict within the personality . It is to be found in countries such as the U.S.A. and Sweden , which have experimented in prohibition . These two countries head the list . . . issued by the World Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholics-Italy , that great wine-drinking country , having the lowest . . . <P> " The WHO report gives a provisional figure ( 1,100 per 100,000 adults ) for the proportional number of alcoholics in England and Wales , which is barely a quarter of the American figure . Enough of Sir John Falstaff may have lingered in our midst to mitigate the severity of the Nonconformist conscience and its characteristic personality conflicts . "
