THE PARASITES ( 305 pp. ) - Daphne du Maurier-Doubled ay ( $3 ) . <P> <P> " The bath water . . . pours from the taps with a great splash of sound , and as it runs you sing above it . . . It 's funny , Maria would think , soaping herself with a loofah , that in the evening , if you have a bath , your tummy is round and rather full , but in the morning it is flat as a board , and hard . " <P> Daphne du Maurier 's new novel ( her first about contemporary life since 138 's bestselling Rebecca ) is so plumply padded with this sort of verbiage that it resembles a kind of composite morning &; evening tummy-round , full , and yet flat as a board . Replete with bestselling ingredients . The Parasites is constructed on layer-cake lines , i.e. , a chapter about the dismal present is sandwiched between two flashback chapters about the glamourous past . Three main characters , members of the Delaney family , take turns telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter how they were seduced in their youth and , in the next , how they were reduced to frayed middle age-a sort of time-consuming part singing by a glee club that has known better days . <P> Theirs is not an easy relationship . Glamourous Maria is the illegitimate daughter of a lusty old singer whose tender renderings of songs such as Ah , Moon of My Delight caused whole cities to burst into loud sobs . She is in love with sensitive Niall , who is the illegitimate son of the singer 's wife , in her own day a popular dancer . The only legitimate fruit of the muses ' union is daughter Celia , who is as sedate and unromantic as a registered ccw-the invariable fate , in such fiction , of those unfortunate enough to have been born in wedlock . Maria has become a popular actress ; Niall , a composer of popular song hits ; Celia , a self-sacrificing homebody . But all three have reached John Marquand 's " point of no return " with the conviction that they have frittered away their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaneys have a family dilemma worthy of the pen of a <P> Marguerite Steen or a Taylor Caldwell . Yet Author du Maurier , soap her bohemian loofah as she may , fails to froth up a single sud of glamour or blow one bubble of poignant sadness . Even the title she has chosen suggests that Author du Maurier may have felt like apologizing a bit for having run so much bath water to so little purpose .
