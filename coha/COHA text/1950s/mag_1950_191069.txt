A growing interest in religion is evident all over the U.S. On this point members of the Associated Press Managing Editors ' Association agreed almost unanimously at their Atlanta convention last week ( see PRESS ) . Polled as to their explanations of the trend , most of the editors gave psychological insecurity as the chief cause , with war a close second . But at least three credited the swing to the aggressiveness of religious groups . <P> " Religion has been doing a good selling job , " said E. N. Jacquin of the Champaign ( Ill . ) News-Gazette . " Religious promotion efforts , plus the perplexities of modern life " were the causes , said M. H. Williams of the Worcester ( Mass . ) Telegram-Gazette . David Patten of the Providence ( R.I. ) Journal-Bulletin answered : " Religious people seem to want everyone else to get religion . " <P> ... <P> Under the title Is There a Revival of Religion ? Union Theological Seminary 's Reinhold Niebuhr , in the New York Times Magazine , says that " there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of our day which would seem to prove the reality of such a revival . " <P> The evidence , he says , is of two types : " Mass conversions under the ministrations of popular evangelists , " who are enjoying more success " than at any time since the days of Billy Sunday " ; and " in the world of culture ... a receptivity toward the message of the historic faiths , which is in marked contrast to the indifference or hostility of past decades . . . There is scarcely a college or university which has not recently either created a department of religious studies or substantially enlarged existing departments . "
