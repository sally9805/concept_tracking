txt Letters to The Times public opinion . HORACE R. CAYTON.REPORTER.GEORGE B. ALFKE Jr.NAHUM GUTTMAN , Letters to The Times Fighting Communism Singling Out of Negroes Is Opposed , Lack of Positive Action Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRK In the Sept. 3 issue of THE TIMES I read an editorial concerning the bill authorizing the minting of 50-cent pieces in honor of Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver . While realizing that THE TIMES wrote the editorial in all good faith , I have some questions about it which I would like to raise in this letter . The editorial stated that 50-cent pieces were to be issued as memorials to these men and , as it is customary to sell these pieces for $1 each , the proceeds would be used to combat communism among Negroes . THE TIMES approved both the idea of the memorial and the purpose for which the net proceeds were to be used . My first objection to the editorial and , incidentally to the bill itself , is that these two Americans were not honored as just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communism . Both  --  Mr. Washington in the field of education and Mr. Carver in the field of science  --  have merited such recognition . It seems that this could have been done without raising the Communist issue , as has been done in the case of so many other persons . Further , it seems to me unfortunate to have singled out the Negro in this fashion as a special area in which communism should be fought . If we are to fight communism let us fight communism not among Negroes , or Italians , or Jews , or among any particular group . Recent Study Cited This identification of the Negro with communism is unfair and dangerous . It is unfair because it is untrue . A very serious and competent study of the Negro and communism has recently been published by the University of North Carolina Press . It was written by Wilson Record and is called " The Communist Party and the Negro Question , " It is Mr. Record 's conclusion that at no time did the Communist party have any great influence over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of years of concentrated effort to enlist them . Such identification is dangerous because the fear on thepart of many persons that the Negro might turn to communism  --  a fear born more of guilt than of fact  --  can be used to discredit legitimate struggles on the part of the Negro for a greater participation in our social order , Already some important figures in Negro life , such as Walter White of the N. A. A. C. P. , have been untruthfully called Communist . Those who would be unwilling to grant the Negro his rights may find a convenient weapon placed in their hands by this identification of the Negro with a very unfavorably ' regarded political party . Finally , I must say that I was sorry THE TIMES did not see fit to state that this bill came with bad grace from a Congress that would not act on the entire Civil Rights issue or take a clear-cut stand on discrimination in the armed forces . If there is fear , in spite of the fact that it is not true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to communism , why then did not this Congress strike at the injustices which surround the Negroes ' existence in the United States and which is one of the greatest causes for our embarrassment before the civilized world ? THE TIMES , of course , is not responsible for the failure of the Congress to act , but this failure could have been well pointed out in the editorial . Failure to Act It is to be hoped that the many Americans who wish for a statesmanlike approach to the entire problem will- not be taken in by this sop and that politicians who have failed to address themselves to this problem will not be given credit for this gesture after they had failed to act constructively . It is important that all of us stop thinking of the Negro question as something apart either in fighting communism or in sharing democracy . It is important not only because the rights of millions of people in this country are involved but because our failure to achieve democratic rights for a tenth of our nation will continue to embarrass us before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pittsburgh Courier correspondent at the United Nations . Pittsburgh , Pa. , Sept. 6 , 1951 . Conduct of Newsmen Questioned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The indignation of America 's working newspaper men at the imprisonment of their colleague , William N. Oatis , is completely understandable . Mr. Oatis is the victim of a crass frame-up and it is not likely that the relationship between the United States and Czechoslovakia will improve until he is released . However , it may be questioned whether the expressions of indignation voiced ? by reporters interviewing Mr. Prochazka , the Czech Ambassador , were in the best traditions of American journalism . Reports of press interviews with Mr. Prochazka contain such phrases as " ? a reporter shouted " and "  --  a reporter snapped . " American newspaper men have enjoyed a reputation for impartiality both in attitude during an interview and in the articles that they write . Some of them who have worked abroad have not admired the tendency of many reporters in other countries to take personal part in the controversies that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor of Ethiopia , appeared before the League of Nations to plead the cause of his country , Italian newspaper correspondents jeered and hooted at him from press gallery . In the ParliamentS certain European countries the news men make ? their partisan attitudes known vociferously from the sections reserved for the press . American journalism can learn much from the best journalism abroad , but it is not necessary to adopt this least desirable of foreign newspaper practices ii the open participation of the reporter in the controversy about which he will write . Skillful news writers will make their indignation plain in the manner in which they set forth the facts . The raised voice of anger , even if the ex ? cuse is as great as the unjust treat . ment of a colleague , belongs on the editorial page and not in the interview , REPORTER . New York , Aug. 30 , 1951 . Reservist Program Upheld Necessity Seen for Insuring an Adequate Supply of Reserve Strength To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a twice-recalled inactive reserve officer now on active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of overseas combat duty as a pilot in all theatres of the Second World War , with ten more months of Berlin Airlift duty on my first recall tour , I may perhaps be qualified to voice the protests to which I am moved by the letter from reservist " H. C. , " appearing in these columns on Sept. 6 . With considerable effort I Will try to be rational rather than emotional , pointing out first that H. C. speaks half the facts . The proposed recall of inactive reservists he is disturbed about is a four-day processing tour for rated combat crew officers , such as pilots , navigators , bombardiers , radar observers , etc . Certainly H. C. will concede that times like these demand an ad. ministrative inventory of flying person . nel . If we are to face the future with any certainty at all we must insure that our reserve strength is really strength , and not merely a roster of " glamour boys " who , while desiring the glory of a voluntarily accepted reserve commission ; have permitted the skills they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. could hardly have been the naive " youngster full of heroics and immaturity " at the time he accepted the reserve appointment he will now " regret the rest of his life . " This " rest of his life " would be of unknown duration without a reserve . A recall for a more extended tour than four days would not need to result in a " broken home . " Thousands of families are contributing husbands today to the preservation of the freedom he refers to , with some inconveniences , but incomparable to those an alternative course may offer , and with a mini .. mum of broken homes . The wives , children , homes and job levels described would not be his if we were forced to bear the expense of an adequate regular military establishment . If H. C. can not spare four days to the furthering of the security of the blessings he enjoys , there are other alternatives . As a widely traveled ex-flyer H. C. knows only too well what these are . While H. C. prays for his freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beaten into swords if we are to preserve the values at stake in the present conflict . GEORGE B. ALFKE Jr . Bayside , N. Y. , Sept. 6 , 1951 . Israeli Health Fund Identified To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The review of the rehabilitation program in Israel by Dr. Howard A.
