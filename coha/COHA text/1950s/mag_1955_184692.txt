For 123 years the copper-hued tsurigane ( hanging bell ) of Tokyo 's Nishi-arai Dai-shi Temple rang out over the city , its tone as rich as a mighty organ . When the temple survived the Tokyo earthquake of 1923 , a superstition arose that the tsurigane was imperishable . Then , on an autumn day in 1943 , a drab-colored Japanese army truck carted the half-ton tsurigane away to be melted down , with thousands of other Buddhist temple bells , into war scrap . The bell disappeared from sight , but its memory lingered . <P> At war 's end , men of the U.S.S. Pasadena found it intact and undamaged among the scrap in the battered naval base at Sasebo , 800 miles southwest of Tokyo , later donated it to Pasadena , Calif. , where it was placed in the city hall . Tokyo 's people heard that their bell was safe in a beautiful American city , but they were too proud to ask for it . Then , last June , Pasadena 's Board of City Directors decided to return the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared a welcome . Special sutras ( prayers ) were composed , hundreds of streamers and leaflets were distributed throughout Tokyo . A 13-year-old girl wrote a song , The Bell That Came Home . Borne in colorful procession through Tokyo 's streets , the tsurigane was greeted by a chanting crowd of 10,000 . Chief Priest Hamano broke into unashamed sobs of happiness during his speech , and the U.S. Air Force band joined in the welcome by playing When the Saints Go Marching In . To mark the return of the tsurigane , the temple last week restored its monthly Go-Ennichi ( Honorable Fete Day ) for the first time since 1943 . As the bell looked down on the scene from a temporary belfry , worshipers thronged the temple , and nearby streets echoed to Japanese folk dances . Said a temple priest : " May the relations between Japan and the U.S. be as imperishable as this tsurigane. "
