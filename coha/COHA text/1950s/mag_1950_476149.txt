FOR a brief period recently I was an old-age pensioner in New York City . It was something I had never expected to be . I have earned a good living most of my adult years . When I went to work forty years or so ago I had no thought of a career . Simply , in my middle twenties I was faced with a man 's responsibilities and I had to meet them in a man 's way . By the time I was thirty-five I had an executive job in a New York office . As my work increased in scope and pay , I invested my savings in what I was advised were reliable securities . In November 1929 they went the way of the Stock Exchange . When our firm failed to withstand the depression which followed I opened an office of my own , earning enough to do what I had to do by reducing my living expenses and cutting down on savings . Shortly before the late war I was taken with a physical illness which became so severe that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resume work the war was over . Doctors ' and hospital bills and expensive dentistry had depleted my bank account . Coming back in a changing world was not easy . Youth was in the saddle and riding high . New techniques and devices weighed against those trained in an old order . By patient study and practice I succeeded in getting enough work to Iive on and to keep a bit ahead of the first of the month . But when an order on which I hadput in several months without pay was can-celed I found myself penniless and in debt . Seeking public assistance is abhorrent to me . It is inherent in me to be self-sustaining . But here I was , sixty-five and strapped . What was I to do ? I was determined not to borrow any more money that I might not be able to repay . Rather than lose my self-respect by becoming a sponge and a dead-beat , I sought the assistance to which I had been a contributor by way of taxes . r WAS an unseasonably hot , spring morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the City De-partment of Public Welfare . Crowding the floor a constantly increasing stream of humanity made its way up the stairs to a clamor of many tongues , with Caribbean Spanish in the ascendant . In a glassed-in corner , a woman at a desk was talking to two men who stood beside her . She beckoned to me . As I came to the doorway , her pale-blue , accusing eyes looked me over from hat to shoes . " Yes ? " she questioned in a sharp staccato . The men started to leave the cubby-hole . " Do n't go , " she said smiling and holding out a detaining hand . " Nothing private . " Then turning toward me she repeated her question . I asked if I might have a word with her . " That 's not necessary , " she replied , jerking her head to one side and appraising me with a truculent eye . " Just tell me what you want . " When I had told her , she penciled a number on a slip of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , smiling at the men . " Orie flight up " was a loft that had been partitioned into a narrow hallway and an office-waiting room which ran the length of the building . At one side , close to the windows , were the desks and chairs for the staff . Except for a narrow aisle on each side , the rest of the room was occupied by rows of relentless seats , nearly all of them filled . The woman at the information desk looked at the slip of paper in my hand , jotted down the number on it , and told me to sit down and wait until I was called . As the occupants of the seats were preponderantly young thought I had come to the wrong place . " I 'm looking for the Old-Age Pension Bureau , " I said . " That 's been out of the picture for some months . Relief applicants arc all bunched together now . " She raised her eyebrows and with an indicative smile added , " The new economy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back row and waited while a large number of people who appeared to be Puerto Ricans were called . They answered singly , in couples , or in families , some of which rose in steps from toddlers to grandparents . All were flanked by interpreters . They were a merry hat given to much laughter . Whatever their troubles may have been , they were disposed of with dispatch and the seats they had vacated were promptly refilled from the standing crowd in the hall . As the hours wore on from nine until half-past twelve , the air grew stifling with the increasing heat and the fetid odor of unwashed bodies and cheap perfumery . Sitting beside me , a wrinkled and arthritic colored woman , immaculate in a stiffly starched cotton dress , whispered behind a discreet hand , " This seat sure hurts my bones right hard . How do you stand it to sit so straight ? " A finely featured , neat , but shabby man sat on my other side . He appeared to be in the late seventies and his face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting up to walk around , he complained ofthe pains in his hands and feet caused by sitting too long in the same position . One articulate and gregarious old body punctuated the long wait with frequent changes of seat , the better to air her view on the precedence given the youthful applicants in the front rows . They get the best of everything , " she said to me . " You know why ? " I shook my head . " Politics ? they 's thousands of ' em ? and they all vote for him ! " She mentioned the name of a district boss . T T THIS point a pleasant-faced , middleaged woman at a desk across the aisle came over to me . " I 'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long . What 's your number ? " Looking at it , she said , " Conic with me . " Taking a chair from the line she placed it by her desk and told me to be seated . " Now what can I do for you ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you do n't look old enough ? That 's bad ? unless you have absolute proof . " I said that I had . On her desk was a pile of printed sheets . She took one . dated it , and asked my full name , the place and date of my birth , whether I was single or married , widowed or divorced . Next came the same questions about my parents and the husband I had divorced forty years previously . Have you any money or property of any kind ? Any insurance policies ? Where was your last job ? Have you anyone to help you ? Can you give me responsible references ? These , of course , were necessary items of the categorical routine and I was prepared to answer them . When she questioned me about my religion , I paused for a split second . " You do n't have to answer that if you do n't want to , " she said . " I do n't mind . I 'm a Christian and a Protestant . But I 'm wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nothing , really , except that we can send you a social worker of your own faith . " This never eventuated . She filled in some blank spaces on the application , glancing at me between lines . Her quizzical eye made me self-conscious about my appearance , and I explained that I knew how to sew and trim hats and could therefore make do on very little . She hastened to reassure me . " You 're not the kind who would ever look poor . " She hesitated , then went on . " Do n't be sensitive about this . You 're only asking for something you 've paid for in advance . . . . " I interrupted her to say that I did not expect to remain a pensioner as I had work in prospect for the fall . " You 're entitled to it as long as you need it . And do n't think you 're one of a kind . You 'd be surprised at some of the names on the list . " Handing me the application , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following week . " Be sure , " she cautioned after naming the woman I was to see , " to bring every proof you have of your birthplace and parentage , your passport if you have traveled , a list of responsible references , all the bank statements and canceled checks in your possession , together with your doctors , dentists ' , and hospital bills , and the names of friends or relatives who can help you . " II I Din as I was told . Arriving at the tick of nine in the morning , I was put through the same routine of overcrowding and waiting as on the previous visit . My number was called at twelve-fifteen . The interviewer to whom I had been assigned was a painstaking and efficient woman of fifty or so . She greeted me with an apology . " Some of my questions may be embarrassing to you . And they may seem unnecessary . But they are regulation . If you will co-operate with me , I shall do my best to expedite your application . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbatim is scarcely possible . The following is a resume of the most revealing questions and answers . " Was your father well-to-do ? " " I suppose you 'd call him so . " " What became of his money ? " " He died over forty years ago . His will left everything to my mother . " " What happened to her money ? " " Like many husbands , my father did n't believe that a wife should know anything about business . My mother was defrauded of herfortune by unscrupulous agents . She died twenty years ago . " " How did she live for the other twenty years ? " " An older relative and I took care of her . " " How much money did you have in the bank when you were taken ill ? How much did your illness cost you ? " I told her to the best of my ability . The bank account had been closed out long ago . The receipted hills for my illness had been turned in with my income tax returns several years hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furniture , a piano , articles of value . . . or furs ? . . . Furs are important . It was a lady with a mink coat who made it difficult for women of your kind . " I explained that I had sold my furniture , piano , silverware , and wrist watch some time ago and that I had no furs ? nothing in fact but my clothes , some books , and a few family momentos of no value to anyone but myself . Next I was asked for the names of my former employers , my creditors , and all banks with which I had ever done business . I gave them to her , handing her the statements of the last bank in which I had had a running account . We sat at her desk until half-past two , while I was asked to explain every check I had drawn over a period of six months . I could not remember how I had spent the money from some small checks made out to cash . " I wish you could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing , I 'm afraid . " When all questions had been answered to the best of my knowledge , I was told to return on Tuesday for another interview , this time with a young woman in the finance department , who asked inc practically the same questions as those submitted by the previous interviewer and gave me the name of a woman whom I was to see on Friday . On Friday a girl in her early twenties returned my credentials and said that a social worker had been assigned to call on me " some time next week . " I asked her if she knew what day that would be , as I wanted to be home . " We never tell that , " she said . " This is an investigation . They just drop in on you . " She smiled wryly and added , " In case of a mink coat . " III A FTER ten days of waiting , a young girl presented herself as the social worker assigned to my case . Intelligent and affable , she , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask me . She began by saying that if I would co-operate she would do her best to get me the " assistance . " She explained that it was not really a pension in the sense in which the word was used in other stases , but a combination of federal , state , and city relief . Her cross-examination began with , Have you any friends with money ? If so , wo n't they help you ? " I replied that some of my friends were well-to-do , but that I had no claim on them ; and that like many people today they felt that their high income and excise taxes , together with their contributions to private agencies and the general community funds , more than fulfilled their philanthropic obligations . " But what about that older relative who helped your mother ? Would n't he help ? " " He might , " I chuckled , " if I wait until his resurrection from the dead . " " Maybe we could write to your former husband ? Perhaps he would help out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to open up old wounds and , among other things , explain that he had never been able to support himself . " Do you know his address ? " I did n't know . I had heard that he was tragically ill and entirely dependent upon his present wife . Then , " What about her ? Would she help you ? " " Even if she were in a position to do so , I would not think of asking her , " I replied . " We have never met ; and they were married years after I left him . " Well , then could n't " they " call upon some of the firms who had given me work from time to time ? In a small and highly competitive field there are few secrets ; and if word were to get around that I was " on relief , " I feared that I would be branded a failure and would be unable to get further work . I told her this . " I 'm afraid ' they ' will think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for old-age assistance were put through the same catechism . She answered that she had to be sure that I had nothing . " Most applicants have not and they look as if they had n't . You look as if you might have . " Three days later she dropped by to say that she had interviewed several friends whose names I had given as references . " I never met such wonderful people in all my life . I 've talked so much about them at home that my mother and father arc fed up . I 've recommended the acceptance of your application and you should receive a check within a few days . " FORTNIGHT went by . NO check arrived . There were days when I went hungry . I ran farther behind in my room rent and borrowed small sums from long-suffering friends . Called on the telephone , the case-worker said she could do nothing further . " We used to have a special cash fund for such emergencies , " she added , " but the new Commissioner has cut it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailing three printed slips for me to sign , authorizing the banks with which I had done business at various times to give the department whatever information they might have about me . One of the accounts had been closed in 1930 and another in 1944 . When the slips arrived the line on which the names of those for whom they were intended was blank . I called the case-worker to say that this was rather like signing a blank check , and asked her whether they were really meant for the banks . " That I ca n't tell you , " she said . " All I know is that if you do n't sign them your application will be denied . " I was desperate . So I signed . As the mailbox closed upon them , I felt as if a rope were tightening around my neck . The procedure seemed to me so wholly authoritarian in manner and spirit that for the first time in my life I felt unsure of myself and my country . IV S EVEN weeks from the date of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover my expenses for the coming month . Itemized , these were sixty dollars for rent , gas , electricity , cooking and laundry facilities ; six dollars and seventy-five cents for clothing ; sixty cents for " cleaning things " ; and one dollar for " extras attendant upon old age . " The difference , added to the unexpected payment of an ancient loan ( which I had carefully reported ) , made up the food allowance of twenty-seven dollars for a thirty-one day month . Prices in New York City being what they are , the food allowance was scarcely adequate for a bare subsistence . The gerontologists tell us that from fifty years of age on , a diet rich in proteins is imperative with a special emphasis on meat . It was such a diet that had restored my health . The case-worker , while admitting that the allowance was just about enough to keep one from starvation , said that it had been worked out by experienced welfare officials . " Doctors ? " I asked . " No , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods as starches , lentils , dried beans , and peas , cabbage , onions , milk , all salty and synthetic foods were dangerous for me and that I was supposed to eat a good deal of meat . " You can have it once or twice a week ? or maybe three times , if you 're careful . It would be easier , of course , if there were two of you . . . " As a result of having to rely on the prohibited foods to keep going , I was eventually troubled by an old and painful symptom from which my previous diet had freed me . The absence of a carfare or recreation allowance did not affect me . I like to walk and can take three or even four miles at a good pace in my daily stride . I can be happy with good books and music . The books I can get from the public library . For music I need only to tune in on my radio . But I wondered about the old who are ailing and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books bring little solace . What of those who do not have access to a radio and who have no inner resources ? How do they get along without carfare or entertainment ? Are they in their last years to be denied all of the amenities of a decent living ? I found my answer to one of these questions at the hank where I cashed by first welfare check . The case-worker had told me that all city checks were negotiable at any member bank of the Federal Reserve System . So I tookmy identification card and presented it with the check at . a neighborhood bank . The teller told me that an order had come through from the Welfare Department that all New York City welfare checks must now be cashed by their holders at the branches of but one bank . T HE first of the month was an unseasonably hot day with the thermometer registering 95 degrees and a humidity that was appalling . The branch bank to which I went made no special provision for the holders of relief checks who were crowding the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commercial depositors , and workers from the nearby stores ? it is not permissible to make such checks over to anyone else for collection . Immediately in front of me was a very old woman who grew faint from the heat and the pain in her misshapen feet . I asked a floor-man to take her out of the line and help her ' to get her money . His response was , " Sorry , lady . I nearly lost my job last month when I did that for an old man . " " But at least , " I persisted , " you can get her a chair so she can rest until her turn at the window . " He was embarrassed but firm . " Not allowed . Got ta treat everyone alike . " When I resumed my place in line , the old lady told me that the grand-niece with whom she lived had to go to work before the bank opened for the day and there was no one else to come with her . As I took my place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were waiting to help her up the street . The next pay-day I talked with an aged arthritic who could not spare the carfare from his food allowance . He had to hobble seven blocks both ways with the help of two canes . On the two occasions when I cashed my checks I saw , going and coming , many of the aged whose legs were bowed and whose backs bent from years of hard work . It seemed needlessly cruel that no measure had been taken to ease what for me was merely a discomfort but for them a painful ordeal . When I asked the case-worker what would be done for one who was too ill or infirm to make the trip , she replied that there were public homes and hospitals for such people . **33;525;TOOLONG 0 N ONE of her visits to me , I spoke to her about a tooth which was causing me intervals of considerable sleeplessness and pain . She suggested the City 's dental clinic and said she would make an appointment for me . I heard nothing from her until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become my constant companion . I called her up and she said she had requested an appointment for me the day I had spoken to her about the tooth . She informed me that " all dental work is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and the clinics are so over-crowded and shorthanded that an appointment has become a ' pearl of great price . ' " The next morning I received notice of an appointment for the following day from a clinic in a borough five miles from where I live . To get there meant taking the subway which , because of the stairs , is not advisable for me in hot weather . Getting in touch with my case worker , I was told to call up the Medical Division which would switch the appointment to a more convenient clinic . I could hear the girl who answered the telephone at the Division shouting that I " had the arthritis and could n't take subway stairs . " ( The arthritis is something of which I have as yet had no twinge . ) After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of another borough which I could reach by bus . I had never been in this section and I asked the girl what bus I should take . With a loud laugh , she shouted , " That woman is so dumb she does n't even know how to travel . " Eventually the receiver was taken out of the girl 's hand and a soft-spoken medical worker apologized for her assistant 's rudeness and gave me the necessary directions . " There 's no public dental clinic in Manhattan , " she informed me . " Otherwise I would have sent you to one . " The clinic , a dismal loft in a dingy neighborhood , was divided by wooden partitions into a waiting room and several operating cubby-holes . My appointment was for two o'clock . Seated next to me , an elderly woman complained that she had been hack five times to have her plates readjusted . A young woman with a small boy complained that the child 's tooth had been aching for over a month and this was the first appointment she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to takewhen you 're up against it ! " she whispered . Others on the benches nodded in agreement . At two-thirty , a blondined dental assistant ? she was twenty or so ? appeared in the doorway leading to the clinic proper . " Come in , Isabel , " she drawled in a voice one might affect for a sick baby , " and take off your hat . " " If you do n't mind , " I said quietly , " my name is Mrs. Gaines . " She mumbled what may have been an apology . I learned later that city social workers are instructed to address the old by their first names " because it puts them at their ease . " To me it was just one more petty indignity . The dentist assigned to me was a frail little man of uncertain age , sickly pale and with a severe palsy . After three futile attempts to place an X-ray film in its proper position in my mouth , he asked me to do so . Complying with his request , I evoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The operating room to which the dentist led me resembled a slum hallway . The walls looked as though they might have been wet down with dirty water and the drippings allowed to dry of themselves . Here and there on a level with the chair were splotches of dried blood . The radiator was thick with verdigris and dust . Hung on nails on the unclean walls was a row of leaden molds for dentures which were so many landing places for an irate horsefly . The complexion of the windows and the refuse bin matched that of the walls . My guess is that the equipment was a relic of the gay nineties . When the dentist appeared with the developed X-ray film I asked if I might see it . He refused . " I shall make my report to the proper authorities , " he said . " Are you going to pull my tooth ? " I ventured . " I do n't know yet . " Taking an instrument from the swinging table , and without sterilizing it , he started to pick at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gently , for he was very ill , that I could not take it . W ITHIN a few days an unexpected offer of work came to me through the mail . I notified the Welfare Department that I required no further aid . A day or so later another young case-worker walked in on ine . I say this with reason ? it is exactly what she did . When the friend in whose home I have a room answered the bell , the girl brushed past her and started down the hall . " Who are you , and whom do you wish to see ? " asked my friend . " I 'm from the Welfare Department . I want to see Mrs. Gaines . " " Just wait , please , " said my friend , " and I 'll find out if she is in and wishes to see you . " " That 's not necessary . I was told where her room is , " she shot back , precipitating herself into my room with a swish of her glazed chintz dirndl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would say , not more than twenty-three years old . She sat down and , smoothing the folds of her skirt into a straight line , said , " They 've sent me to find out what your new work is , the name and address of your employer , and how much you expect to be paid for it . " " Do n't you think ' they ' are a bit impudent ? " I asked . She fiddled with her chintz reticule , and focusing her eyes on the carpet , answered , " Well , you see we like to keep in touch with our clients .... " " That 's not necessary as far as I am concerned , " I said . " And since what I 'm working on is nobody 's business but my own , I sha n't answer your questions . " That evening she called up a woman whose name was on my list of references , and asked what I was doing . The answer was similar to the one I had given . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that she can do the work ? " My friend laughed . " I think so . She 's not exactly senile , you know . " " Well , please do n't tell her that I called you . I think it would be best for her not to know that I had . " V T HE close-up I had had of this kind of assistance differed so widely in spirit and technique from anything I had observed when in times past I had helped out as a volunteer in private agencies that I was left with some questions which begged for an answer . There was the apparent discrepancy in the allotments ; the delays to which some applicants were submitted and the indifference to the plight of those among them who had reached a point of immediate need ; the ineptness of the young case-workers who lack the delicate perception implicit in their jobs ; and the constant imputations that you were a fraud : " Where did you get this ? Is that etching worth anything ? You 're not supposed to own anything salable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , were grievous defects in a dispensation which might have been full of grace . Here is an instance of what I mean as it was told to me by the pensioner involved . A woman seventy-two years old , she lives alone in a dark , one-room-and-kitchen tenement apartment which , I can testify , she keeps scrupulously clean . To give it a touch of color as a substitute for the sunshine she never gets , she cut down on her clothes allowance to buy a strip of bright oilcloth for her kitchen table and a pot of geraniums for her window sill . A friendly neighbor happened in with a gift of some freshly-baked cookies one afternoon and was invited to stay for a cup of coffee . They had scarcely settled down to enjoy themselves when a youthful case-worker came panting up the stairs . Opening the door which was partly ajar , she went into the kitchen , inspected the oil-cloth , put her nose to the geraniums , and , nibbling a cookie , announced that she would have to report this extravagance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' money on such trifles. " said this young thing to the woman who had spent close to forty years scrubbing the floors of business offices for fifty cents an hour . On the other hand , another woman had quite the opposite to say of her experience . " I get along beautifully on what they give me , " she said , but did riot tell me how much she was getting . " They give me everything I ask For . And I live well . Last month they gave me the linoleum for my kitchen floor and had my arm-chair upholstered . " She added that of course she had influential friends . I wondered if this explained what a city welfare worker said to me at the time of my inquisition . She asked me if I knew any politicians . When I answered in the negative she remarked , " Too bad . If you did , it might help some . " For enlightenment I went to someone of importance who for many years has served on the boards of private philanthropies and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained to me that the department chiefs must carry out the wishes of conflicting political factions . " Do n't blame them , " he said . " If they do n't do what they 're told , they will lose their jobs . And they 're told to do one thing one day , and something quite opposite the next . They feel at the mercy of political career men whose hearts are in the headlines , men to whom social welfare measures are but a means to some end they may have in mind . They are not interested in helping the needy , " he went on , " so much as in the party vote . For those who are in office , or who expect to run for it , welfare is a pork-barrel of jobs and relief for henchmen , relatives , and constituents ; for those who are nut , it is a two-way instrument for getting back by putting the other fellow out . And their attitude toward it changes with the shifting of the political winds . " I ASKED about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusions had been made . He sent me to Mrs.  - -   - -   , who had looked into the case for a private agency when it was dropped by the city 's relief roll . " It was , " said Mrs.  - -  -  , " a perfect example of what can happen anywhere when any two factions are opposed to one another . " On the one side was the charge by the state politicians that the city 's relief organization was a welter of waste and incompetency . On the other side was the city 's complaint over the percentage returnable to it from its contribution to state taxes . The natural outcome was an investigation with a fanfare of publicity . One day an investigator called upon a woman who was living on relief in a midtown hotel just as she was going out . She had on a mink coat . The next day the newspapers carried a headline story that the woman and her child were being maintained on relief money in a " luxury-class " hotel ; that her coat was of considerable value ; and that eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her $40,000 and , later , another $22,500 . According to Mrs. - , whose agency conducted a thorough non-political investigation into the woman 's circumstances , the mink coat was a present from the woman 's first husband in the earlier years of their marriage . At the time she applied for relief it was the only warm coat she possessed and was so well worn that it had no appreciable sales value . The hotel where she was living was middle-class and medium-priced and she was there only until a suitable home for her and the little girl could be found . It was true that her first husband had made a comfortable settlement on her at the time of her divorce . But her second husband , who was the father of her child , had helped to squander it , deserting her when there was no more money . " Had it not been for us , " said Mrs.  - -  -  , " the summary withdrawal of relief would have left her and her child destitute . As it is , the anxiety and humiliation brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental nursing home . The little girl is being cared for in a private family . " A T THIS point I interpolated , " But still I do n't see what this had to do with old-age assistance . " " In New York , " said Mrs.  - -  -  , " it is not a special service as it is in some other cities , but just a part of the general relief program . Because of the exposure , services and disbursements were cut to the bone . Personnel was reduced . The cash fund for applicants in immediate need was discontinued . Workers were instructed to ' get tough ' with applicants , particularly those whose appearance was not indicative of poverty . And this applied to old and young alike . " I had seen enough to know that some of the charges that followed the general investigation were well founded . Therefore , I could understand the curtailments in some directions . But I could find no excuse for the complete lack of understanding of the problems and sensibilities of the elderly which was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect ? " questioned my informant , when I had said this to her . " The pay of the case-workers is so low that the well-equipped older social service experts will not accept such jobs . Young people just out of college sometimes do so to gain experience but they stay only until they can get better jobs in the private agencies at higher pay . " The explanation seemed to be complete . There is the inherent difficulty of running a fair and humane relief service when different political groups are battling over it . There is the vulnerability of such a service to sensational attacks , and the resulting fear that it will be imposed upon . There is the lack of money and prestige in the public welfare jobs . There are the delays and duplications of effort , and the routine indifference , of a jog-trot bureaucracy . In almost any community such a combination of difficulties may cause what is done for people in dire need to be inefficient , cruelly slow , and galling to honest men and women . Yet even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensibilities of those older citizens who , overtaken by adversity after a lifetime of labor , still cling to their self-respect ?
