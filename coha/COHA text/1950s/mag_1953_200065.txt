" The Prime Minister has benefited greatly from the month 's complete rest prescribed by his doctors . " So said a communique from No. 10 Downing Street last week . <P> It is now known that Sir Winston Churchill suffered a slight stroke , * and that it was followed by one mild relapse . But , leaving his Chartwell home last week , he posed cheerfully for photographers , and waddled unaided to his car . pausing on the way to admire a lime tree in the yard . Beside him on the car seat , in token of the busy days ahead , lay a box of black cigars . He headed for Chequers , Britain 's country retreat for its prime ministers , which he does not like as well as Chartwell , though it is closer to the pulse of things . There he let it be known that he was not pleased with the recent foreign ministers ' conference in Washington , and still wants top-level talks with the Russians . But mostly , the old warrior pondered one grave decision : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always wished ? Or should he hand over his favor to his faithful friend and ( nephew-in-law ) Anthony Eden , while he was still able to decide the succession ? Eden 's own health , and the ascending political popularity of two other Tory cabinet members , Rab Butler and Sir David Maxwell Fyfe , made the issue important . <P> At week 's end Eden , leaned out by his illness , but feeling fit ( see NEWS IN PICTURES ) , flew in from his U.S. convalescence to join the Prime Minister at Chequers . For two weeks they would talk it over , before setting out for the Mediterranean . Guessed one Churchill associate : " Winnie might hand over around the time of the annual Tory conference in October . I would n't lay you 2 to 1 against it . " <P> <P> *Brought on by contraction of the blood vessels in the brain . This often happens to elderly people who work too hard ; the stroke suffered may be so slight that the patient is often unaware of it .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
