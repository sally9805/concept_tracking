Hope flared last week among viewers who may have longed to see a subject of This Is Your Life poke M.C. Ralph Edwards in the nose that he sticks weekly into a private past . The week 's subject : Jack Dempsey . The ex-heavyweight champion , now 61 , was the prize catch so far among celebrities whom Edwards has tricked unsuspecting into TV camera range for exposure to a parade of memory-rattling acquaintances , some of whom they have forgotten ( or would just as soon forget ) . But the Manassa Mauler was caught with his guard down in the middle of the ring in a packed Hollywood Legion Stadium , and he never laid a finger on Edwards . <P> Gamely he tried to roll with each blow in the M.C. 's unctuous volley . The first guest was a Utah farmer who reminded Dempsey that they had sparred as boys . Dempsey stared in blank dismay as the man climbed into the ring , then went into a friendly clinch and clung as if for the bell . Next he was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to church and believe in God ? " he guessed desperately . " Live by the golden rule and keep goin ' , " prompted Edwards firmly . " Keep goin ' , " repeated Dempsey . He kept goin ' . Only once , with obvious inadvertence , did he throw a verbal counterpunch . " Now they say you were a hobo , " droned Edwards , " but you were never really a hobo , were you ? " Dempsey groped , then murmured gently : " I think I was a hobo . " The audience howled , and Edwards grinned through clenched teeth . <P> As old ring foes piled through the ropes , Dempsey engaged each in a heavyweight exchange of compliments . Said towering Fred Fulton , whom the Mauler knocked out in 18 seconds of the first round in 1918 : " If I had to lose , I was glad it was to Jack Dempsey . " Replied Dempsey : " It was you fellows who made me . " From France came Georges Carpentier , a dandy of 63 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the Argentine came Luis Angel Firpo , 62 , once the Wild Bull of the Pampas , now a lumbering giant whose dignity shone somehow through his confusion with the alien nonsense around him . Gene Tunney , anticlimactically absent , sent a message of homage to " the noblest Roman of them all . " In turn , Dempsey thought that Tunney was a fine fellow and a great champion , " regardless of what anybody says . " Soon afterward , Edwards danced away unscathed , and as they read the closing commercial over Dempsey , it sounded dimly like the count .
