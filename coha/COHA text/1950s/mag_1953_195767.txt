When the first Korean truce rumors spread through Wall Street last week , stock prices suffered the worst break in two months . Government bonds , which had been slipping for weeks , skidded some more . The Dow-Jones industrial average slumped 4.65 points to 267.63 , lowest since last October . Then , as the week wore on , and reports of an impending truce became official , prices steadied . With the help of some buying by the Federal Reserve , Government securities also firmed up . Once again , the stock market showed that it is not peace that scares stock traders so much as uncertainty . <P> What will peace do to U.S. business ? Where does the U.S. economy stand ? Banker Marriner Eccles , onetime chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , had one answer : " We 're at the top of our boom now , and there are heavy deflationary pressures . Shortages are giving way to surpluses . More consumer goods will be produced than are sold . The home-building peak has passed . . . Exports are falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little change for the rest of the year in business , neither " further inflation nor deflation . " <P> <P> All but Dead . In general , there was little worry over the effects on business of a truce . The stock market , for example , seemed to have a cushion against a further sharp decline . Many investors who had been selling stocks and taking their profits at higher levels were looking around for likely buys at last week 's lower prices . Furthermore , on the basis of past performance , companies could suffer some drop in profits without any damage to their dividends . Prewar , corporate dividends averaged 74% of earnings , whereas recently they have averaged only 58% . Another hopeful market portent ; despite Dwight Eisenhower 's plea for extension , the excess profits tax seemed all but dead come June 30 ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . <P> For the rest of the economy , said a top Government economist last week , " the 1953 outlook is brighter now than it was two months ago . " There were plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Commerce Department reported , department-store sales hit the highest level ever , except in the war-scare months of July 1950 and June 1951 . Personal income was still rising , industrial production ( 242 on the Federal Reserve index ) was within a hair of its peacetime high , and a record of $12.6 billion in new construction was started in 1953 's first five months , up 6% from a year ago . The labor market reflected the boom conditions : in April , said the Labor Department , layoffs were at the rate of nine per 1,000 employees , a new postwar low for the month , and hirings ( at 42 per 1,000 ) were well above 1952 . <P> Vote of Confidence . Here and there , some warning signals flew . Auto sales were high , but peak production ( at an annual rate of 6,450,000 cars ) had pushed dealers ' inventories to the highest levels in many months and used-car lots were full . Appliance stocks were piling up in some cities . In Detroit , a price war broke out among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric portable mixers . <P>
