riches , one is reminded of the childhood ditty which , in one of its versions , begins , " One little , two little , three little Indians , four little , five little , six little Indians , seven little , eight little , nine little Indians , ahangin ' on the wall . " One little Indian has already fallen of the wall , for when Nelson Rockefeller beat Averell Harriman for governor of New York last November , Harriman 's great dreams were sadly shattered . There are eight little Indians left ahangin ' on the wall , eight Democratic aspirants whose chances are at least worth talking about . They are : Gov . G. Mennen Williams of Michigan , Gov . Pat Brown of California , Gov . Robert Meyner of New Jersey , Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson , Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota , Sen. Stuart Symington of Missouri , Sen. Jack Kennedy of Massachusetts , and  --  ahangin ' on the wall in a somewhat wraithlike fashion without admitting that he 's really there at all , but ahangin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year and a few weeks from today in a welter of smoke and sweat and oratory ? " Let us rise above mere partisan politics , my friends " . . . " I invite all Americans , of whatever race , creed or political belief to join me in this great crusade " . . " I give you  --  The Next President of the United States " ? all the other little Indians will have fallen off the wall , and there will be only one left . And make no mistake about it  --  ail the men listed above would dearly love to be that one . Anyone attempting now to predict the identity of that surviving little Indian would be well advised to consult an alienist . Indeed , any prediction at all of what may happen among the unpredictable Democrats in convention assembled in the summer of 1960 is exceedingly foolhardy . But let us be foolhardy . Let us knock four of the above-mentioned little Indians right of the presidential wall , and then go on to consider the peculiar problems of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the next Democratic presidential candidate  --  and , quite possibly , the next President of the United States . Two of the eight little Democratic Indians have only an eyebrow 's hold on the wall ? " Soapy " Williams and Pat Brown . Both men have an excellent theoretical claim on the nomination , but neither of themjs going to get it . Consider the case of Williams of Michigan . Elected six times hand running as governor of one of the big swing states , he ought by all the old rules to be the man to beat . Williams is an able politician , and a highly intelligent one  --  he has a better claim to the title of " egghead " than Adlai Stevenson . Moreover  --  as indicated in the most candid of the statements accompanying this article  --  he wants very much to be President and will make a do-or-die try for it . But Williams is not the man to beat because he has already beaten himself , with a strong assist from labor leader Walter Reuther . The nickname , the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew cut and the boyish manner  --  these have been big assets to Williams in Michigan . But they are terrible drawbacks to the Williams presidential candidacy . For they have robbed Williams of that elusive , intangible , but essential asset in an aspirant to the White House  --  the presidential smell , Williams just does n't smell like a President . The alliance with Walter Reuther is the coup de grace . " Sure , " one Democratic strategist has remarked , " the Republicans would love to run against Reuther , but we 're not that dumb . " When Williams trailed his ticket in last November 's elections , the Democratic Party heaved a collective sigh of relief and counted him out . So let 's knock poor Soapy off the presidential wall . Let 's knock Pat Brown off the wall too . Like Williams , he has a valid claim to the nomination . He comes from the second-biggest state . As victor over Sen. William Knowland he is a proved giant killer , and the political balance of power has been shifting steadily west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Brown is a Catholic , and if the Democratic Convention turns down one Catholic ? Kennedy , the present front runner  --  it seems unlikely that it will then nominate another Catholic for President . Yet Brown 's worst drawback is his lack  --  more so even than in the case of Williams  --  of the presidential smell . When you ask Brown 's friends and admirers about his presidential chances , they look startled for a moment and then say : " Well , Pat 's a wonderful guy , but President  --  uh , no . " That " uh , no " tells the story . So now we come to Robert Meyner of New Jersey  --  let 's knock him off the wall too . This is a somewhat brasher act than in the case of Williams or Brown . Meyner is included in almost all lists of serious candidates . But it would take a couple of major miracles to get him the nomination . For one thing , when he was elected governor of New Jersey in 1953 , right after the Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbinger of glad tidings . He had a chance to light a fire in the land , especially among Democrats . No fire has been lighted . But his greatest drawback is something else . Where the Kennedy candidacy hurts the Brown candidacy , it just about kills the Meyner candidacy . Meyner was born and brought up in the Catholic Church . In college he lost his faith in Catholicism and abandoned the church . He has joined no other church  --  which is not likely to help him among strong Protestants either . But it is just about inconceivable that the Democratic Party , which // delivends on a heavy Catholic vote , is going to turn down Kennedy , the first serious Catholic candidate since Al Smith 's day , and then turn right around and nominate a candidate who has left the church . Here let us pause for breath in our game of ninepins and make two observations . One is that the religious issue , thanks to the Kennedy candidacy , is absolutely certain to play a bigger part in this election than at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But it is so , and every professional politician in the country , Catholic and non-Catholic , is quite aware that it is so . The other observation is that a quite unprecedented situation has developed as regards the Democrats and 1960 . It is an old rule of American politics that " governors get it . and senators don't. " in modern times , no sitting senator has been nominated for the Presidency by either party  --  except Warren Gamaliel Harding , and he was a sport or mutation . Each party has nominated any number of governors . Yet , already we have brashly knocked out three governors in a row , leaving four senators plus only one ex-governor , the wraithlike Adlai Stevenson . Perhaps we have been too brash , and the old rule will still hold in 1960 . But the fact is-. - and it is an interesting and significant fact  --  that the Senate has for the first time in our history become a better breeding ground for presidential candidates than the statehouses . Always before , the governors have had one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors do n't . Thus senators , unlike governors , have to take stands on the national issues , and so al ienate very large numbers of voters who disagree with them on those issues . But nowadays , with the basic postulates of the New Deal tacitly accepted even by a Republican Administration , there is only one genuinely domestic issue which really riles and roils the emotions of very large numbers of voters  --  the issue of civil rights . On other issues the differences among Democrats who could conceivably be nominated for the Presidency arc mere differences of tone and emphasis . Other than civil rights , the great issues nowadays are the life-anddeath issues of foreign and defense policy . A mere governor  --  a Williams or a Brown or a Mcyner  --  has no real chance to establish a reputation in the foreign and defense fields unless , like Nelson Rockefeller or Adlai Stevenson , he has a reputation ready made . But a senator does have an opportunity to establish such a reputation . And all four of the leading senatorial candidates arc exploiting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader Lyndon Johnson , for example , immediately after the launching of the first Soviet Sputniks , deftly seized outer space itself as his own limitless empire . With his customary brilliance he will do everything that can be done to associate the conquest of space with the name of Lyndon Johnson in the public mind . He will also do everything that can be done  --  and he can do lot  --  to make himself " available " for tht nomination . In a secret vote of the Sen , ate and the Capitol Hill press corm , moreover , Johnson would probably wore high man as the ablest politician the Democrats have to offer , One of Johnson 's colleagues , himself a leading presidential candidate , recently paid Johnson as high a compliment as one politician can pay another . " You have a serious chance , " Johnson 's ed. league was told . " of becoming President of the United States in 1960 . Does n't that thought sometimes give you nightmares ? ' " Well , " he replied , " of course I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a lot of chickens are coming home to roost in 1960 . But I know all the other candidates pretty well , and I frankly think I 'm as able to handle the Presidency as any of them , or abler  --  all except Lyndon , and he has n't got a chance . " The reasons why Lyndon Johnson " has n't got a chance " have been examined at some length in a previous report in The Saturday Evening Post LYNDON JOHNSON : How Doss HE Do It ? by Stewart Alsop , Jan. 24 . Here it is enough to ask only one question . Johnson comes from Texas . Neither party has nominated a presidential candidate from below Mason and Dixon 's line since before the Civil War . Is that rule going to be broken now , when feelings on the racial issue are more passionate than at any time since the Civil War , and the Negro vote larger ? The question answers itself . So now we come to the serious candidates , the candidates on whom a shrewd gambler , given sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are : Senators Hubert Humphrey , Stuart Symington , Jack Kennedy and , of course , the perennial Adlai Stevenson . These are the four little Indians who are really left ahungin ' on the Wall , once you realize how feeble are the handholds of the other four , Of the surviving four , Hubert Humphrey probably has at the moment the feeblest hold . He conies from Minnesota , a comparatively small state from the standpoint of population and a helluva place from which to run for President  --  as Harold Stassen discovered , Humphrey first made his national reputation by forcing Southern states to bolt the party , on the civil rights issue , in 1948 . Although many southerners , including Lyndon Johnson , like him and respect him for his remarkable energy and intelligence , the big southern bloc at the convention will be solidly and fiercely against him . But Humphrey 's greatest drawback , as he himself is well aware , is the reputation he built for himself in his early years as a windy radical from the windy West . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential smell . He means to do his best to acquire it by cultivating a sober and steadfast mien . " Maybe it would help if Hubert learned to smoke a pipe , " one of his admirers has remarked . But changing his public face is not easy for any man , even as able and adaptable a man as Humphrey . Even so , Humphrey must be listed among the top four contenders . A lot of people think he owes that enviable position to his marathon chat with Nikita Khrushchev . But the well-publicized Khrushchev interview was only the icing on the cake . The cake itself was the defeat of Averell Harriman in the New York election , and the poor showing of Soapy Williams in Michigan . When Harriman was defeated , and Williams ran far behind his ticket , that left Humphrey as the only active candidate who could be supported with real enthusiam by the northern liberal-labor group . This ill-defined and amorphous group . which includes the old New Dealers , the more politically minded labor leaders , the A.D.A . intellectuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once was . But it is powerful still , with something close to a veto power at Democratic Conventions . Old Alben Barkley was cruelly counted out by a liberal-labor veto in 1952 . The great liberal patroness is that marvelously matriarchal figure , Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt , who has attributed to Humphrey a " spark of genius , " and all but endorsed him . In private , Adlai Stevenson has also been smiling rather pallidly on the Humphrey candidacy . He has told well-heeled friends , like former Sen. William Benton , that he is himself not an " active " candidate , and that he will " understand " if they decide to " help Hubert . " As a result , Humphrey has for the first time the promise of serious financial support , hitherto wholly lacking . In this sense Stevenson 's rather tentative support is an important Humphrey asset , But Stevenson is at the same time a millstone round Humphrey 's neck . For Stevenson is the liberals ' one true love , The liberal altitude toward Humphrey is suggested by a paraphrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert , so much , loved we not Adlai more . " As long as Stevenson still exists as a possible nominee , in however wraithlike a form , the Humphrey candidacy will lack the fierce and fanatical drive which an outsider needs to go over the top . Other than the classic Sherman statement from Stevenson  --  which is not at all likely to be forthcoming  --  the best thing that could happen to Humphrey is another southern walkout . A southern walkout would drain delegates from both Kennedy and Symington , and it would make Humphrey the logical man to test a theory long held by northern liberals  --  that the Democratic Party would be better off without the South . But Humphrey will do nothing himself to force the southerners out  --  to do so would strengthen the public 's mental picture of Humphrey as a wild-eyed extremist . And , of course , even a southern walkout would by no means assure the nomination of Humphrey  --  the convention would be more likely to turn to a " moderate " to save what could be saved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he thought it would be fair to say that the odds against his nomination were about eight to one . He allowed that that was about right . Here let us pause again for breath and for another observation . All the little Indians we have examined so far have a large , invisible X across their faces  --  there are excellent reasons for the convention to turn each one of them down . That is also true , as we shall see , of Jack Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson . There is only one candidate without the X. He is Sen. Stuart Symington of Missouri . If politics were a logical business  --  which it markedly is not  --  one could confidently predict the nomination of Symington by a simple process of elimination . Symington 's big plus is his lack of big minuses . Nobody hates him . He has quietly voted the straight liberal line on all issues , including civil rights , so that the liberals have no logical reason to veto him . But the southerners do n't really dislike him either  --  Symington comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike Humphrey , made ferocious civil-rights noises . Many conservative businessmen also like Symington , who has been a successful businessman himself  --  perhaps the businessmen feel instinctively , as do the southerners , that Symington 's heart is to the right of his voting record . Symington also has had what Humphrey and Kennedy lack  --  experience in the executive branch , as Secretary of the Air Force and in other important posts . Symington has a first-class political brain truster in Clark Clifford , former special counsel to ex-President Harry Truman . Clifford 's old boss is expected to come out for Symington , in his usual flatfooted way , whenever the time is ripe . So are other powerful figures , like Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn . So are a number of the big-city professionals , like Jack Arvey of Chicago . Both Carmine De Sapio of New York 's Tammany Hall , and Pennsylvania 's governor and Democratic boss , David Lawrence , have been privately making tentative Symington noises . Both men are Catholics , but like a number of Catholic politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumbering religious prejudices . Symington 's national reputation rests on his strong stand on the defense issue , on which events have increasingly proved him a prophet with honor in his own country . Yet being identified with a single issue can be dangerous to a candidate , even when he is right . When Symington holds a press conference or appears on a television show , the same thing always happens . When he tries to talk about domestic or foreign policy issues , his questioners always revert to defense . " Maybe Big Bomber Stu would make a fine Secretary of Defense , " one of his rivals has remarked , " but that does n't qualify a man for the Presidency . " This suggests one line that will be used against him . " Stu is a nice guy and everybody likes him , " the same rival continued , " but being liked by everybody does n't quality a man for the Presidency either . " This suggests another anti-Symington line . During the next year Symington must persuade the voters that he is an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of powerful Democrats that he is a two-fisted fighter in the political arena . If he does so , he might be the man to beat , come July , 1960 . But at the moment the man to beat is clearly Kennedy of Massachusetts , who has a healthy head start on all the other candidates , One reason he has a head start is the simple fact that he started earlier . Kennedy has been running for President ever since he lost , by a whisker , his 1956 bid for the Vice Presidential nomination . Since then , he has visited all forty-nine states to make speeches and consort with the party faithful . He now knows the key men in the Democracy in just about every state , on a first-name basis  --  a major asset . He has other assets . He has great personal charm  --  the effects of his handsomely boyish face on the lady voters of Massachusetts have been devastating  --  and he has just about the most beautiful wife in American political history . Behind the handsome face there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a masterpiece . but it is respectable and literately written popular history , and the widespread rumors that it was ghosted are not true . Kennedy also has a lot of money . Having a lot of money has become , oddly enough , an important political asset these days  --  the voters apparently reason that a rich politician will not be tempted by oil leases or viculla coats . But money is not the asset to Kennedy that it is to Rockefeller , for instance . His father , former ambassador to Britain Joseph Kennedy , is the fountainhead of the Kennedy millions . The wartime isolationism of the older Kennedy and his hitter feud with Franklin Roosevelt have left a lingering bad taste in a lot of important Democratic mouths . " Old Joe 's trying to buy the White House as a present for young Jack , " Kennedy 's enemies whisper , snickering . Nothing makes young Kennedy more furious . He hotly denies that his father has spent a cent in his behalf . Even so , the whispers hurt . But Kennedy 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if only because without it he could not afford the expensive campaigning he has been doing ever since 1956 . Does Kennedy have that other asset , the greatest asset of all  --  the ' presidential smell ? The answer seems to be that it depends a lot on who is doing the smelling . " Sure , Jack has charm , " the chief strategist of one of his leading rivals remarked recently . " But a lot of Princeton undergraduates have charm , and that 's what Jack Kennedy looks like . The voters are n't going to send a Princeton undergraduate to deal with Nikita Khrushchev . " However , Kennedy will be forty-three in 1960 , and a man of forty-three is hardly in the first blush and bloom of youth . Like Hubert Humphrey , Kennedy also is making an effort , whether consciously or unconsciously , to change his public face . He has taken to wearing a vest , and his public manner is increasingly weighted in favor of seriousness and sobriety , and away from boyish charm . In any event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs neck-andneck with Adlai Stevenson and easily tops all other Democratic candidates , Kennedy has plenty of presidential smell to a lot of voters . His standing in the polls also suggests the nature of his political strategy , which is to go to the convention as the people 's choice , and then challenge the convention , in effect , to turn down the man the people want . The polls are a vital element of this strategy , but the polls will not be enough to make the strategy work . The logic of his strategy clearly suggests that Kennedy must boldly challenge Symington and Humphrey to primary contests in the key states . If the polls are right , Kennedy could be expected to beat them both handily , if they accepted the challenge , and there would then be two fewer little Indians ahangin ' on the wall . Precisely for this reason both Symington and Humphrey are expected to duck any primary challenge from Kennedy . In this case , of course , Kennedy 's claim to the title of people 's choice will be reinforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary delegates . The people's-choice strategy is not a new one , of course  --  nor is it an infallible route to the nomination , as Estes Kefauver discovered . Even so , it is going to be extremely difficult for the Democratic Convention to turn Kennedy down if , in July , 1960 , the polls and the primaries have both shown him to be the most popular candidate . For a lot of Catholics would suspect that Kennedy was turned down because he was a Catholic  --  a suspicion which could doom the Democratic candidate to almost certain defeat . The Convention could , to be sure , take the curse off turning down Kennedy for first place by the simple expedient of nominating him for rand place . And this suggests why Kennedy must at all costs convince the delegates and the world at large that he will not take the Vice Presidential nomination  --  otherwise , the Vice Presidential nomination is all he is likely to gel . Accordingly , Kennedy is flatly telling all and sundry that he would far rather be the senator from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , be the simple truth . It will be very dangerous for the Democrats to turn down Kennedy if he is still front runner in 1960 , and if he makes his rejection of the Vice Presidential nomination stick . Even so , there are influential Democrats , probably proportionately small in numbers but highly articulate , who will fight to the death to prevent his nomination . Although both Joseph McCarthy and the curious political phenomenon to which he gave his name arc dead , among many liberal-intellectual Democrats McCarthyism remains the ruling issue , as civil rights is the ruling issue among southerners . Among these people , there is a favorite anti-Kennedy crack  --  that toward McCarthy the author of Profiles in Courage should have shown less profile and more courage . Kennedy 's two chief Democratic rivals in the Senate both voted to censure McCarthy , but neither was among the first or most passionate paladins of the anti-McCarthy movement . Kennedy was ill when the censure vote was taken , but he has since said that " based on the evidence presented and Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought the censure was a reasonable action . " But this is by no means enough for the really passionate anti-McCarthyites . Among those who attack Kennedy for his record on McCarthyism there are certainly those who are in fact obliquely attacking Kennedy 's Catholicism . There are also those who sincerely believe that Kennedy 's pallid stand on McCarthy , whom he never criticized in his campaigns , rules him out of consideration for the Presidency . Their symbol and leader is that formidable lady , Mrs. F. D. Roosevelt , whose mildly worded remarks about Kennedy and McCarthy in The Saturday Evening Post of March 8 , 1958 , were as politically painful to the young senator as a shiv in the back . The liberal-intellectual forces which oppose Kennedy are not as powerful as they once were , but they are articulate and determined , and they constitute a high hurdle between Kennedy and the nomination . The Kennedy candidacy raises the obvious question : Is it an asset or a drawback these days for a Presidential candidate to be a Catholic ? Kennedy has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him heavily , while the number of non-Catholic voters who oppose him on religious grounds is proportionately much smaller . Recent elections , especially the 1958 Democratic landslide , in which a record number of Catholics were elected to the Senate and to governorships , tend to bear out the theory that Catholicism is now a net political asset . Kennedy 's rivals and critics claim privately that there are many non-Catholic voters who would happily vote for a Catholic senator or governor , but who would balk at a Catholic President . In fact , no one really knows how much times have changed since religious prejudice contributed to the defeat of Al Smith , and no one will know unless or until the matter is put to the test at the polls . The matter will not be put to the test unless Kennedy wins the nomination on an early ballot , for , as he is well aware , as front runner he must go over early or not at all , Suppose Kennedy comes near to going over on the first or second ballot , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritating , childish question : Would n't you like to know ? Several things might happen . Harry Truman and the pros might put over Stuart Symington . Here much would depend on Lyndon Johnson 's course . Johnson supported Kennedy for the Vice Presidential nomination in 1956 , and Kennedy has a lot of admirers in the South . Among the southern Democrats , and among many westerners as well , Johnson will speak with a powerful voice . In a pinch , Johnson might well have the power to put Kennedy over the top . Johnson is not tipping his hand , and will not do so until it is absolutely necessary ; but those who know him well guess shrewdly that , if he had to choose , Johnson , like his friend and patron , Speaker Rayburn , would go for Symington rather than Kennedy . Johnson and Symington have had their moments of tension , especially when , in the post-Sputnik era , Johnson deftly grabbed the defense issue right out from under Symington 's nose . But the two men are on friendly terms again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Kennedy unwisely never does . In a Symington Presidency , Johnson as majority leader could more easily maintain his present unique posi. tion of almost coequal power with the President than in a Kennedy Presidency , And Johnson , who is anything but a fool , is quite aware that this is so . Another thing that might happen is the emergence of a Kennedy-Humphrey ticket . The liberals who do not greatly love Kennedy do not greatly love Symington either , partly because , like the busi. nessmen , they suspect that his heart is to the right of his voting record . They might find a Kennedy-Humphrey ticket an acceptable half loaf . Tentative feelers about just such a possibility have already gone out from the Kennedy camp to Humphrey , who has not been adamantly unreceptive . Or the ticket which is already the true heart 's desire of many northern liberals might emerge in the end  --  a Stevenson . Kennedy ticket . Although Stevenson has told his friends that he will not be an " active " candidate , those close to him have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the nomination again came his way  --  especially if the Republican candi. date were Richard Nixon . As for Kennedy , he can , he will , he must , continue to protest that he is not interested in the Vice Presidential nomination . But if the moment of truth ever comes when Kennedy , having failed in his try for first place , is offered the Vice Presidential nomination , he will have to think long and hard before refusing it . For Kennedy is an ambitious man , and if in his early forties he turns down the second-highest nomination in the gift of his party , it is almost inconceivable that he will have another chance at a place on the national ticket , and he knows it . If you put a pistol to the head of any old pro among the Democrats and asked him , on pain of death for a wrong guess , to name the 1960 ticket , the chances are better than even that you would get the answer : " Stevenson-Kennedy . " Stevenson is the best known of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there are going to be plenty of powerful men at the convention who will use every ounce of their power to prevent Stevenson from leading the Democratic hosts into dubious battle for a third time  --  Harry S. Truman and Lyndon Johnson , to name two . And this suggests why the best guesses of even the most professional of the pros are not worth a great deal so early in the game . Indeed , only one prediction can be made with absolute assurance . Fort hose  --  alas , only a minority of our population  --  who have discovered the fascinations of the great game of politics , the color and drama and spine-tingling excitement of it , the clash of powerful personalities , the triumph and the heartbreak , the devious small-mindedness and the rare nobility , there is a wonderful time ahead . It is hard to recall another time in our history  --  with the conventions only a bit more than a year away  --  when no one could forecast with any assurance at all the identity of the candidate of either major party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts , and as the dual drama of the unique American nominating process is played out to its hot and sweaty climax , it may be hard to bear in mind that the process is something more than a sort of glorified and wonderfully exciting horse race . For when the process has run its course , there will be only two little Indians left ahangin ' on the wall . And then , a few months later , there will be only one , and he will be indeed The Next President of the United States  --  and he will hold history in the hollow of his hand .
