NE of the most delightful scenes in The King and I , the latest Rodgers and Hammerstein musical extravaganza , is that in which the English teacher , played by Gertrude Law  --  rnce , first encounters the royal family of the king of Siam . The family consists of the chief wife , Lady Thiang , seven lesser wives and thirteen children , each of whom has his own nurse or governess . The king , Inapersonated by Yul Brynner , sits cross-legged on a dais , and , one by one , the various members of his do . inestic entourage march on the stage , bow before hail , and then back away and kneel . They stay in this pose throughout the entire scene . Miss Lawrence 8rands by the king . As the seemingly endless succession of wives and children crowds up the stage , to a lilting Richard Rodgers march , while Miss Lawrence looks more and more amazed , the St. James Theater resounds With laughter . When the last and smallest childfinally kneels , the audience inevitably breaks into thunderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after night , does not find this at all amusing . She is a tiny , energetic lady named Mrs. Beatrice Conniff , who works in the basement of the St. James Theater . Above her is the stage . She can clearly hear the tap-tap-tap of the marching feet . All during the scene she winces in agony . Though Mrs. Conniff is employed at a nice salary by the Messrs . Rodgers and Hammerstein , she confesses that she positively loathes the scene in which practically the entire cast of The King and I kneels onstage . Mrs. Conniff 's objections to this scene are not artistic . , She just hates any scene in which actors have to kneel . She can not bear to watch plays in which actors knock other actors down on the stage . She gets upset when she sees costume productions in which the heroine and the chorus wear eveninggowns with long trains dragging along the stage as they cross over . Mrs. Conniff is the wardrobe mistress of The King and I. A wardrobe mistress is in charge of the care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a delicate job because , for instance , in a show like The King and I there are 225 costumes  --  many fashioned of gossamer silk , satin and taffeta , Siamese linen , lame woven out of genuine golden thread , and priceless cashmeres . The costumes were designed by Irene Sharaff , of Hollywood and Broad  --  way , celebrated for her glittering clothes . The pro  --  ducers laid out more than $115,000 for these clothes . Each costume must be in perfect condition for each performance . The entire responsibility for keeping $115,000 worth of clothes clean and whole lies on Mrs. Conniff 's shoulders . " If some of these writers who write up these shows could see what ( Conti iiii ed on Page 81 ) // qwq titions in which the thirty-two singers , dancers and show girls change costumes . Mrs. Conniff sits at a long oilcloth-covered table . The floor is laid with linoleum . Once a week the linoleum is soaped and washed clean . And each day , in her endless struggle against dirt , Mrs. Conniff dusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above and on the side , are long poles , on which hang blouses to he repaired , dresses and suits and robes . In cartons and boxes are shoes and hats . All around are wardrobe trunks . In all this con  --  fusion , the thirty musicians of the orchestra sit around , tuning their in  --  struments . The narrow corridor between her table and the dressing partitions is constantly jammed by the traffic of stagehands , actors , musicians and dress  --  ers . The girls put on their make-up upstairs in their dressing rooms . It is strictly verboten to as much as powder your nose when you are in costume . After the girls are made up , they come trooping downstairs , clad usually in towels . Amidst a clatter and a chatter , and musicians filling the basement with their cacophonous uproar , the girls be  --  gin getting dressed . The basement loud  --  speaker calls out , " Half hour ! " Then " Fifteen minutes . " And " Five min  --  utes . " The musicians creep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 8:30 until 11:40 , men , women and children will come racing up to Mrs. Conniff , whom they call " Connie . " " Connie , I 'm in trouble . I stepped on my sash during that dance and it tore . " " My necklace broke . " " I ca n't find my black belt . " " My hat is slipping . Could you sew a piece of elastic in it ? " " Miss Lawrence wants the bag dyed brown to match her new shoes . " ( Miss Lawrence has two dressers , a personal maid , and a woman to clean and press her clothes . At Mrs. Conniff 's left hand there is a dummy figure with the proportions of Miss Lawrence 's Size 12 figure . ) " The new crown prince is ready for his fitting . " The problem of understudies and replacements is one of the little phases of her trade that make Mrs. Conniff 's nerves get jumpier every season . It works like this : The King and I has one star  --  Miss Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dorothy Sarnoff and Stephanie Augustine . Each one of these has an understudy whose costume is made to order . Then there are about a dozen persons who have minor speaking and acting parts . These twelve are " covered " by members of the chorus . The chorus has two general understudies  --  known as the " swing boy " and the " swing girl . " Now , let us assume that at half past seven one of the twelve minor players telephones the stage manager to say she has sharp stabbing pains in her chest and her doctor advisee her to stay in bed . It is now suddenly neces  --  sary for a member of the chorus  --  let us call her A ? who is covering the ail  --  ing B to step out of the chorus and into B 's costume . B 's costume never fits A. A rushes in desperation to Mrs. Conniff , and she flaps a sleeve that is two inches too long . Mrs. Conniff has less than thirty minutes in which to rip out the seams and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this without completely wrecking the costume because tomor  --  row Miss B will return and the costume must fit her again . Meanwhile , the chorus is short one girl . The swing girl , C , is hurriedly called into action . Of course , A 's cos  --  tume does n't fit C. Racing against the clock , Mrs. Conniff 's fingers fly madly as she rips and tears and measures and pin-bastes , taking in an inch at the waist and two at the skirt , making the shoulder pads fit comfortably and the sleeves hang just so . " Did you ever try to make a Size Twelve fit a Size  --  Ten ? " she inquires . " We 're up against a situation like that two or three times a month . Even if they 're about the same size , there 's always some pesky little difference , and of course the girl is n't happy if the dress do n't fit just right . And if the girl is n't happy , maybe she does n't give a nice performance , and wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us women in wardrobe feel we are unap  --  preciated , and if it was n't for us where would the show be anyway ? " I claim no actress or actor can give a good performance if they do n't feel right in their costume . And these per  --  manent replacements ? they 're as much of a headache as understudies taking the part for one performance . You know , members of the chorus come and go . The dancers get jobs in television or a night club or get married or what all , and naturally the business manager , he do n't want to okay making new costumes for the new girl because they do n't know how long she 'll be in the show . So we have to alter the old cos  --  tumes . I tell you , it 's a very nerve-cracking kind of work . " Like all wardrobe mistresses , Mrs. Conniff is intolerant of any carelessness toward the costumes . The dancers and show girls take a rather detached and languorous attitude toward the cos  --  tumes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or loll around on wardrobe trunks . They sip soft drinks from paper cups or send out for toasted egg-salad sandwiches . " Do n't you know you 're not sup  --  posed to eat when you 're in costume ? " Mrs. Conniff lashes at them . Or , " How many times have I told you not to lie down on that trunk ? " But the stars are no trouble . " Why , Miss Lawrence is fussier about her costumes than about her street clothes , " Mrs. Conniff claims . " She would n't even eat a cracker and a cup of milk in her costume . I 've seen stars like Miss Lawrence or Helen Hayes or Mary Martin take off their costume and put on a robe just for a cup of coffee . You 'll never ? see a star lying down in her costume or dragging her train along the floor . " Wardrobe mistresses have become so fanatical on the subject of cleanliness that sometimes their sanitary enthu  --  siasm leads them astray . In A Streetcar Named Desire , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to wear a faded old evening dress in one scene . Costume designer Lucinda Ballard designed a gorgeous ball dress which cost $450 . Then Mrs. Ballard started to age the gown . She tore apart the lace trimmings . She splotched tea and coffee on the white satin . She rubbed it in dirt . She even burned the dress in two places . The show costumes were shipped in trunks to the Forrest Theater , in Philadelphia , where the play was trying out . It is at the tryout that the wardrobe mistress begins working , about a week before the Broadway opening . Check  --  ing the costumes against her master list , the wardrobe mistress came across : " Act III ? white ball gown  --  Tandy . " She was horrified to see that the gown was torn , dirty and stained . She hur  --  riedly patched up the gown , sewed the bits of lace neatly in place and then rushed the dress to the cleaner 's . It came back spotlessly white . Mrs. Bal  --  lard broke down and wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wardrobe mistress , and then the two of them set to work to age the dress all over again . One of the sketches in Peep Show was a satire on T. S. Eliot 's The Cock  --  tail Party , in which a group of low-comedy clowns pretended to he en  --  gaged in cocktail-party repartee , while two paper hangers papered a wall . As the sketch moved on to a frenzied climax , the comedians began hurling paste in all directions , and by the end of the sketch everybody 's costume was soaked through and through . Billie Peyser , wardrobe mistreat ; of this show , shuddered as she recalled the dirty costumes . " It took me and a couple of assistants about four hours to get the gook out of those costumes , " she says . " We did n't just have to get ' em cleaned . We had to get them bone dry . On matinee days , where we had just a few hours between shows , we 'd go out of our minds trying to get these clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of time that gives wardrobe mistresses attacks of anx  --  iety . The dean of all wardrobe mis  --  tresses is an extraordinary eighty-two  --  year-old woman , Isabelle Duncan , known to Broadway as Mother Duncan . She has been a wardrobe woman for over sixty years , and is still carrying on as the wardrobe mistress of Paint Your Wagon . In 1936 , she handled the wardrobe chores for Vinton Freedley 's production of Red , Hot and Blue . The show was trying out in Newark . On the afternoon of the tryout , Mother Duncan was on her way to the theater when she saw fire engines outside . She entered and found out there had been a small fire on a stairway backstage . She walked down to her quarters in the basement  --  and stepped into two feet of water . In putting out the fire , the firemen had flooded the basement . " Every costume was soaked , " Mother Duncan recalls . " We had a show to do in four hours . Mr. Freedley wanted to cancel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes dry . I talked the manager of the Robert Treat Hotel into opening their laundry room . I put all the stagehands to work , and we trucked all the wardrobe trunks over to the hotel . We started working the steam press . By eight o'clock , we had the clothes for the first scene all dried out . After that , it was nip and tuck , but we managed to get the clothes over , scene by scene , and they did n't have to leave out a line ! " Wardrobe women are resourceful . In Call Me Madam , Ethel Merman wears several elegant evening gowns with long trains . A wardrobe mistress regards a train with somewhat the same sensation of doom that a mother feels when she sees her newly dressed small boy heading for a large mud puddle in the back yard . But Miss McMahon does n't worry about trains . She uses detachable trains . After each performance , she unseams the trains , cleans them , and sews them back on in time for the next performance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of damage . Frequently , a chorus of twenty-four girls may have five minutes to get out of one skin-tight costume and into another . Some tearing is inevitable . In The King and I , there is a dresser to every six girls , to help speed them up . At various times , wardrobe women have tried putting slide fasteners in clothes with the idea of speeding mat  --  ters . But this is risky , because when a fastener jams it can be sheer catas  --  trophe . The tendency in costume mak  --  ing is to use hooks and eyes  --  they are slower but surer . One performer who has no use for hooks and eyes is comedian Bobby Clark . Mrs. Peyser who has taken charge of Clark 's disguises in such shows as Star and Garter , Mexican Hayride , As the Girls Go , and Sweet  --  hearts , says that the first thing she has to do with Clark 's clothes is remove all the hooks and eyes and replace them with slide fasteners  --  not ordinary ones , but extra-heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondness for slide fasteners is quite irrational but he likes them , and a producer always caters to a star 's whim . In Sweethearts , there was one scene where Clark had to tear up his pants and a coat . The costumer had designed a pair of breakaway pants and coat , with special easy-to-rip seams , so that Clark could tear up his clothes without permanently damaging them . But the comedian was n't satisfied with the sound . " I got to have something that sounds like tearing a piece of paper , " he insisted . Mrs. Peyser solved the problem by sewing strips of buckram in the seams , so that when he ripped his clothes apart it sounded precisely like tearing a huge sheet of crackling paper . With all the split-second changes and quick tailoring these women are up against , they still have to make everything fit perfectly . " The thing about this work , " Mrs. Conniff ex  --  plains , " you have to like clothes  --  sewing , cleaning , ironing . And you need loads of patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a twelve-year-old boy in the cast of King and I. He came by with his cos  --  tume one day . Said it needed ironing . I said , ' Would you lay it on the ironing board , please ? ' He turns to me and says , ' You lay it on the ironing hoard . I 'm an actor ! ' Of course , besides pa  --  tience , you have to know how to use patterns and have the knowledge of materials and be able to work fast and always fit the clothes perfectly . There 's some actors you ca n't ever please . I wo n't mention any names , but there 's some that 's always after you to tear out this and alter that and change this , and no satisfying them either . " Mrs. Conniff has been trying to make clothes fit bodies since she was six years old and playing with dolls in Macedon , New York , where she grew up . She had ten dolls , and her favorite was a three-foot-high boy doll , for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie , socks and even shoes . Her grandmother taught her to sew and work with patterns . By the time she was thirteen she was not only mak  --  ing all her own clothes but making clothes for her mother as well . In 1901 , when she was sixteen years old and living in Brooklyn , she went to work in a millinery department . She received $1.50 a week . " We were never allowed to have any stitches showing , " she says . " It was all the very finest blind stitching . If you had a single stitch showing , the madam made us do it all over . " In 1903 she was married to a spice salesman and bore two children . When she divorced her husband , in 1917 , she returned to the hat business , working as a copyist of high-priced hats for a large millinery shop . Both her son and daughter became interested in show business . Her son became a pro  --  fessional musician and her daughter became a specialty dancer . In 1923 her daughter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on the road after its Broadway run . Mrs. Conniff decided to give up her millinery job and travel with the show , to keep an eye on her pretty daughter . In Greensboro , North Carolina , the ward  --  robe mistress of the show became ill after eating some pork , and in New Orleans the company manager per  --  suaded Mrs. Conniff to take over the assignment . A year later she became one of the wardrobe mistresses for Lee and J. J. Shubert , and she handled such shows as A Night in Venice , A Night in Spain , Wonder Bar , Everybody Wel  --  come , The Wonderful Night , At Home Abroad , The Boys From Syracuse . Like most wardrobe women , Mrs. Conniff has become worldly-wise in the problems of young and beautiful ac  --  tresses , dancers and show girls . She is always ready to provide a shoulder for them to cry on , she advises them on their moral dilemmas , diagnoses their psychosomatic ailments of the stomach and larynx , gives them pills , and now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until payday . " You get two kinds of problems with the girls , " Mrs. Conniff explains . " A lot of trouble starts when the show goes on the road . The girl is away from her family and friends , and she gets lone  --  some . She gets interested in an actor . She does n't stop to think that he 's married . She decides she 's in love with him . She 's all ready to break up his marriage and settle down for life with this actor . I try to discourage such nonsense whenever I can . I explain to the girls that it 's just a physical at  --  traction and is not real love . Of course , if I see it is real love and the man is free , I certainly would encourage it , but personally I feel the average ac  --  tress is better off marrying a stagehand than another actor .

It is the age-old tempta  --  tion of the millionaire playboy who is prepared to offer the girl a side-line career as his mistress in return for diamond bracelets and mink coats .

" I tell them to choose love with a nice quiet boy with  --  out too much money , rather than get  --  ting mixed up with some fancy-pants who will make them feel miserable in the end . I do n't believe in easy money , I tell them . Everything you get in this world you must work for . You ca n't find happiness that way , I tell them . " " Well , " I asked , " do they usually heed your advice ? " Mrs. Conniff sighed . She sewed some gold braid on a pair of slippers worn by the king of Siam .
