THE CAPITALIST MANIFESTO ( 265 pp. ) - Louis O. Kelso and Mortimer J. Adler - Random House ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> The overriding merit of this book is a reminder to the reader-a reminder that capitalism is a revolutionary force in human affairs offering still unplumbed promise for the future . <P> Significantly , the book is not the work of a professional economist , but springs from the collaboration of a lawyer and a philosopher . Four years ago Philosopher Mortimer ( The Syntopicon ) Adler decided that the 400 Great Books were about to have company . That was when a 600-page manuscript on the theory of capitalism thudded onto his desk at his Institute for Philosophical Research in San Francisco . The author : a hornrimmed , bow-tied corporation lawyer named Louis O. Kelso . Except for Kelso 's wife , Adler was the first person to see the book ; U.S. readers will see it shortly under the sweepingly simple title Capitalism . So challenging did Adler find Kelso 's ideas that he proposed the two men collaborate on a kind of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to Capitalism what The Communist Manifesto was to Das Kapital . " <P> The styles are scarcely comparable . Marx-Engels wrote in fire ; Kelso-Adler seem to be writing under water . Yet the book achieves a triumph of grey matter over grey manner . Four points stand out : <P> 1 ) The Capitalist Manifesto approaches economics and political science , where expediency is apt to rule , in terms of morality and natural law . It asks not only " Will it work ? " but above all " Is it just ? " <P> 2 ) It sees capitalism as the only just form of economic life , paralleling democracy which the authors regard as the only just form of political life . <P> 3 ) It asserts that the moral aim of capitalism is not toil but leisure ( leisure here defined not as play but as the " liberal work " of civilization ) . Real capitalism should bring not only full employment but full enjoyment by men " of the leisure work that machine-produced wealth can make possible for all . " <P> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however great its performance and promise , will not lead to this capitalist ideal but to more and more socialism . <P> Economic Citizenship . The vision at the heart of The Capitalist Manifesto is that automation will make the machine the superslave of man . Just as in the Greek state the slave-owning few were freed from toil to pursue the duties of citizenship and the work of civilization , so all men could be similarly freed ( argue K. &; A. ) in a future society where machines are slaves . In such a society , men could shun the " subsistence work " and " drudgery " involved in the production of " goods of the body " and-apart from the necessary tasks of management-turn to the arts and sciences , religion , education and all the other " goods of the soul . " <P> Marx knew capitalism at its 19th century worst , decided it could never reform , and remanded it to the custody of the state . Result : tyranny . Marx 's error , say K. &; A. , was his failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property itself , but undue concentration of capital in a few hands . The Kelso-Adler answer : decentralize capital , make everybody a " citizen-capitalist. "
