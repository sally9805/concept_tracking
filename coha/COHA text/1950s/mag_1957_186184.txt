With 28 medical clinic designs behind him , Seattle 's Paul Hayden Kirk , 42 , has emerged as the West Coast architect who can design just what the doctors order . Two years ago a group of seven Seattle psychoanalysts and psychiatrists , banded together as the Blakeley Psychiatric Group , went to Architect Kirk with a special problem . As one of them stated ( with some symptoms of frustration ) : " Situated in the business district and open to the distractions of an apartment hotel , we run a dismal gauntlet-slamming doors , dripping faucets , a view of an alley , rattling trucks and an s.o.b . who dotes on playing the banjo . Once my attention was taken from a patient by the sight of a whisky bottle swinging on a string outside my office window . " They wanted a new building custom-tailored to their needs . <P> Architect Kirk was eager to tackle their problem . A childhood victim of polio , he had long since come to the conclusion that " architecture can be medicine , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , low , $112,000 clinic building that bears no resemblance to standard medical surroundings . Patients arriving for their 50-minute hours last week were ushered through the Oregon-basalt entrance into the spacious waiting rooms , screened by a shoji . The long , sky-lit corridor ( which has warm , hand-rubbed oak-flooring walls ) leads to the ten consulting rooms , each soundproofed to silence , looks out through a full glass wall onto a serene , narrow garden court planted with vine maples and deciduous huckleberries , and backed by a plastic fence paneled in off-white , honey and burnt orange . <P> After the first week 's trial , one analyst last week stretched contentedly in the soft office chair , sighed : " I just ca n't tell you how much less tired I 've been feeling at the end of each working day . " As for the patients , one psychiatrist said : " I 'd summarize patient reaction as a kind of ' Wow ! ' " Another found a patient hesitant about " speaking terrible thoughts amid all this beauty , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something optimistic here . " <P> The reaction suited Architect Kirk right to the bottom of his T square . Said he : " It is too much to hope that the building itself can cure , but clearly it can be a symbol of health . I guess my psychiatric friends might say it 's a back-to-the-womb feeling . But then that 's been basic to all architecture since the comfort of the cave . "
