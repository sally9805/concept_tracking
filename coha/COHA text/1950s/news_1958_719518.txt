txt A new depreciation accounting requirement by the Civil Aeronautics Board , effective January 1 , 1958 , will boost the reported earnings of Eastern Air Lines sharply during the next few years , The Wall Street Journal learned . For 1958 , the - increase could amount to about 39 million after taxes .. The new C.A.B . ruling requires that airlines depreciate their flying equipment over a sevenyear period , and that the aircraft be depreciated to a residual value of 15% plus a sum equal to one major overhaul of the airliners . Eastern 's policy for many years has been to depreciate its planes on a four-year basis down to a residual value of 5% or less . Eastern estimates that its 1958 depreciatioq , under Its own policy , would have amounted to about $37.8 million , but that application of the C.A.B . formula , which the airline has accepted under.protest , would cut the allowable depreciation charge to about $19 6 million , a decrease of $18.2 million . In future years the discrepancy would be even greater , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be cut to about $29.6 million from $54.5 million , a difference of $24 9 million . For 1960 and 1961 there would be an estimated , reduction of over $28 million each year . Eastern had taken a strong stand against the C.A.B . ruling on the ground the Board has not sufficiently taken into consideration the obsolescence factor in modern airplanes , which can become obsolescent in much less than seven years . As an example , it says , the DC-7 series of airliners now operated will become almost completely outmoded by 1960 through the advent of the Electra turboprop and DC-8 jet airliners , delivery of which begins in 1959 Eastern contends that under the new policy these aircraft will not be written off by the time their useful competitive life ends . The other argument Eastern has been using against the C.A B. policy is that the residual value of 15%. which would amount to about $300,000 in the case of A $2 million DC-7 plant , plus about another $100,000 for the major overhaul , is not in accordance with the probable resale value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices have declined sharply in the past year , and with a flood of used DC-7s , up for sale beginning in 1960 , there is no guaranty there will be a good market for them . In 1957 . Eastern charged off depreciation of about $28 8 million and repotted net income of $9,325,000 , which included some non-operating earnings from sale of equipment . The result of the C A.B . policy will be to increase reported earnings during the next four years and to decrease reported net income for the following three years . Accounting for tax purposes will not be changed to a major degree , however , by the C A B. method . Eastern continues to depreciate much of its equipment , such as the ** under certificates of necessity which allow a five-year write-off period for tax purposes . In common with practice in other airlines , Eastern is setting up reserves against future years to even out the tax factor over a full seven-year period .                  @ @ @
