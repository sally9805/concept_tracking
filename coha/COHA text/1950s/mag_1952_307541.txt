GIANT ( 447 pp. ) - Edna Ferber-Doubleday ( $3.95 ) . <P> For more than a quarter of a century Novelist Edna Ferber has specialized in just one kind of book-the bestseller . Whether she writes about the Midwest ( So Big ) , the Northeast ( American Beatify ) , or the Northwest ( Come and Get It ) , the result is the same : a blend of regionalism and superslick storytelling that guarantees the bookseller some of his happiest moments . In all fairness , she gives her faithful reader full money 's worth as well . Consistent old pro that she is , Author Ferber has undoubtedly done it again at 65 with Giant , her eleventh novel and her first in seven years . Booksellers bought close to 100,000 copies in advance of publication . <P> Giant is about Texas and it has already had the commercial good luck to annoy a lot of Texans . Running as a serial in the Ladies ' Home Journal , it began to make enemies with the very first installment . For the Texas seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose vulgarity runs second only to the flash wealth that nurtures it . <P> Poor Leslie . Leslie Lynnton met Jordan Benedict when he dropped in at her gracious old Virginia home to buy a fine horse that Dr. Lynnton owned . Leslie was slim , well read , provocatively frank and altogether charming , an exceptional gal for even the Old Dominion . " Bick " Benedict owned one of the biggest ranches in Texas , couple three million acres or so . He was big , handsome , impetuous and all male . In no time at all he wooed and won Leslie , brought her back to the huge Reata ranch as his wife . <P> Texas fascinated Leslie ; it also appalled her . Texas food nauseated her . The famed steaks were " enormous fried slabs , flat , grey , served with a thick flour gravy , " and sometimes topped by a couple of fried eggs . The Texans seemed to her as bad as their food , loud braggarts who had stolen Texas from the Mexicans and now treated them like peons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overdressed nitwits . When Jett Rink , the fabulous oil millionaire , gave a party , Leslie saw " Stetsons worn with black dinner coats . . . women in Mainbocher evening gowns escorted by men in shirt sleeves and boots . " In the huge Reata house the library was bookless , the music room " mute . " <P> There 's Hope . Leslie was loyal . She entertained her husband 's dull friends , learned to take their new-rich gaucheries in stride , brought up two fine children . But she never stopped criticizing Texas , never let Texans drag her down to their level . At Giant 's end , daughter Luz has rebelled against Texas ' Juan-crowism , is sweet on a young fellow who is interested in scientific farming and does n't give a hang about million-acre ranches . Son Jordan is married to a Mexican girl , aims to become a doctor and work among the poor . In short , says Author Ferber , there 's hope for Texas yet , once this generation 's crop of oil , cotton and cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
