President Eisenhower flew last week from Washington ( 19 ) to Key West , Fla. ( 72 ) for two weeks of work and exercise in the sun . He took with him warm Christmas memories : of a 40-lb . Kansas turkey and an 18-ft . Christmas tree , of his three grandchildren caroling O Come , All Ye Faithful for a crowd of press photographers ; of his First Lady , in a red dress , showing off one of the presents she received before church on Christmas morning , a gold-star medallion inscribed on one side " To Mamie " and on the other " For never-failing help since 1916-in calm and in stress , in dark days and in bright-Love , Ike . " <P> Starting at 9:15 a.m. in the Columbine III , the President reached Key West in 3 hours . He was accompanied by his brother , Dr. Milton Eisenhower , and Mamie Eisenhower would follow them down for New Year 's weekend . He got a rousing welcome as he drove from Boca Chica Naval Air Station to the Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman Street ( which sports a Margaret Truman Launderette ) and by Eisenhower Drive , which had been known , until the night before his arrival , as North Beach Road . Not three hours afterwards , the President was happily whacking golf balls in 50-to 70-yd. pitch shots . Then he walked along the waterfront of the naval base , talking to his brother about the submarines , destroyers , and the varieties of palm trees they passed by . " Hope you feel better , Ike , " one Navyman called out . " Thank you , " the President replied . " I certainly should feel well in this climate . " <P> After about 30 minutes of striding and strolling , 102 days after the heart attack that cast certainties into doubt the world over , the President turned to Dr. Howard Snyder , the man who had first tended him in Denver . " Can I walk some more ? " the President hopefully wanted to know . " Sure , " the doctor replied .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
