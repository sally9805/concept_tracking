Wayne University 's Professor ( of English ) Donald J. Lloyd has long believed that Americans are too busy thinking about their grammar to learn how to write . They are possessed of a demon , " a mania for correctness , " writes Professor Lloyd in the current issue of the American Scholar . " Our spelling must be ' correct ' - even if the words are ill-chosen ; our ' usage ' must be ' correct ' - even though any possible substitute expression , however crude , would be perfectly clear ; our punctuation must be ' correct ' - even though practices surge and change with the passing of years . . . The idea . . . rests like a soggy blanket on our brains and our hands whenever we try to write . <P> " Except for the professionals among us , we Americans are hell on the English language . Our writing is muddy , backward , convoluted and self-strangled . . . Furthermore , almost any college professor . . . will agree that his students ' writing stinks to high heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on usage is to pursue a vicious circle . . . The literate public seems to get it from the English teachers , and the teachers get it from the public . . . A phony standardization of usage appears in print , the work of editors unconscious of the ultimate meaning of what they do . <P> " The result of all this is that a wet hand of fear rests on the heart of every non-professional writer who merely has a lot of important knowledge to communicate ... It is always a comfort to him if he can fit himself into some system , such as that of a business or governmental office . . . With what relief the pedagogues subside into pedagese ! " <P> Professor Lloyd finds no such repressions hampering American speech . " The ordinary American is in conversation a confident , competent expressive being . . . But with the negative attitude that attends all our writing , those whose main interest lies elsewhere are inhibited . . . until the sight of a blank white page gives them the shakes . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writers and readers together-and stop riding each other 's backs , will the casual , brisk , colorful , amused , ironic and entertaining talk of Americans find its way into print .
