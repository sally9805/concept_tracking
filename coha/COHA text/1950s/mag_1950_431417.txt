LATE summer , 1918 . In an officer 's club full of smoke , conversation , and rattling newspapers , Lieutenant F. Scott Fitzgerald worked away at The Romantic Egotist , preparing another chapter for shipment to his Princeton typist ... . In a jammed little Italian hospital , young Ernest Hemingway shifted his smashed leg and reread the slip of paper on which a British officer had written for him : " By my troth , I care not : a man can die but once ; we owe God a death . . . and let it go which way it will , he that dies this year is quit for the next .... " At Chaumont , France , Sergeant Edmund Wilson stuck pins in G.H.Q. maps and reread A Book of Prefaces . . . . E. E. Cummings sweltered in a French concentration camp . ... Private John Dos Passos of the U. S. Medical Corps , notebook in hand , wearily traced his newsreel of death and terror back through the years in Italy , at Verdun ... . Late summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried five and a half columns of death notices , and even now , as twilight deepened , the mournful roll of army trucks could be heard outside , carrying the day 's dead to outlying cemeteries . The great influenza epidemic of 1918 ? 19 was at its height . The week 's toll for the city approached fifteen hundred . But if the disheveled man upstairs at 1524 Hollins Street noted this , or even heard the muffled rumbling outside , there was no indication . Hunched over his tiny portable , hands well scrubbed , he studied the blank sheet before him . Restive , he glanced at the completed typescript on the pivotal bookcase , then swigged lustily from the glass of tap water beside him . Now the last truck rolled down Lombard Street into the gathering darkness . Now the house lay quiet beneath him . Now he pulled long and heavily at the cigar in his well-muscled jaw , the lengthening ash approaching his face at a quarter-inch clip . And now two fingers shot out toward the waiting keyboard . The aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , and have been since early manhood , an editor of newspapers , magazines , and books , and a critic of the last named . These occupations have forced me into a pretty wide familiarity with current literature , both periodical and between covers , and in particular with the current literature of England and America . . . .  | He stopped , swore softly , and , laying the cigar aside , wrote " into a familiarity with the current literature " over the line . Then , settling back , he wrote on . ... It was part of my daily work , for a good many years , to read the principal English newspapers and reviews ; it has been part of my work , all that time , to read the more important English novels , essays , poetry , and criticism . An American born and bred , I early noted , as everyone in like case must note , certain salient differences between the English of England and the English of America as practically spoken and written ? differences in vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been greatly interested in these differences for over a decade . Words of the vulgate , words with which to spice his reviews and columns , had become a sort of hobby , and shortly after the establishment of the Baltimore Evening Sun it had occurred to him that others might have a like interest . Stuck one afternoon for a column to plug the editorial page he wrote " The Two Englishes . " The subject proved surprisingly popular . Early in 1914 he actually wrote Ellery Sedgwick , asking an opinion on the Atlantic Monthly 's hospitality toward an article " on certain peculiarities of the American language . " Some time in late 1915 or early 1916 he wrote a long article and now he was rewriting it into book form . In the beginning the work was desultory , but as the summer came on he sank into a sort of pedagogical coma . He had , in his furious manner , wolfed down most of the existing books on the subject , and as autumn neared he traveled far into the lands of scholarship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical move to the West ; the preservation of Elizabethan verve in speech and the paralleling triumph of Puritan dogmatism in England ; the development of Americanisms ; the powerful influence of regionalism on American speechways . On October 14 he had finished the draft of his text . The following year The American Language was published . THE impact of the book was terrific . With one powerful stroke H. L. Mencken had hewed in half the umbilical cord which philologically bound this nation to England . Later strokes were to come ? and he was to deliver them ? but the immediate effect of that first edition , coming as it did with the dying echoes of rifle fire in France , was tremendous . Even the pedagogues were stirred . The New York Sun , alarmed , asked , " Can English be saved ? " " Never , " said the New Republic , " has the flourishing personality of H. L. Mencken been so happily exercised as in. this big book on the living speech of America . " In the circles where language is written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm blow over ; as late as the fall of 1924 a convention of the National Council of Teachers in St. Louis resounded with denunciations of The American Language . Mencken was astonished . He had conceived the book as an innocuous diversion during troubled times ; once it was off his hands , he thought it " a heavy indigestible piece of cottage cheese . . . . I thus purge my blood of inherited pedantry . " He heartily agreed with Alfred Knopf , his publisher , that so small a public awaited such a work that the edition should be limited to fifteen hundred copies . When the bookstores , their stock exhausted , demanded more ; when the resale price soared from five dollars to ten dollars to twelve-fifty , he was bewildered . Why the uproar ? " I have never been a scholar and have never pretended to be one , " he protested . " I 'm just a sort of scout for scholars . I accumulated the material and tried to put it into a readable form , so people could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were , and there were plenty , and my hope and idea was that the material I had accumulated would be used by actual philologists . " Information poured in from all over the world ? notes for the revised work his correspondents were sure would follow ? and Mencken , dazed and confused , began organizing against the new edition Knopf was trumpeting in New York . But he could n't understand it . Something had happened . II SOMETHING had happened . A war had ended , but more : a new era had begun . The day of the American Protective League , of the war saboteurs , of Mencken 's antipathy to the war President , the day when to be German was to be suspect ? that day had passed . Its last vestiges were fading that  | summer as the Language mail flooded Mencken ; fewer were the parades down North Charles Street , with bayonets gleaming in the sun and the bands playing " There 's a Long Long Trail A-Winding " ; fewer were the flashes of khaki and French blue along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's appetite for excitement had not , as the success of Fitzgerald 's This Side of Paradise was presently to testify . Skirts were going up ; young women were painting their faces and puffing defiantly , if awkwardly , on cigarettes ; and on the horizon was heard the harsh , plaintive wail of the saxophone . Along the streets of many an American town a discharged soldier , haunted and lonely , tracked down an elusive job . It was 1919 . The twenties were on the threshold ? and so was H. L. Mencken . Mencken voted for Harding the following November and sat back to enjoy the show . It looked like farce , and farce was to his taste . He voted for Harding ? and then , through the few years that pathetic figure had to live , subjected him to a merciless and withering fire . On March 4 , 1921 , he rode over to Washington , and sat perched on a folding chair for the opening act of the comedy . Back in Baltimore that evening , he squatted before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No other such complete and dreadful nitwit is to be found in the pages of American history .... " That year the lines were drawn . All over the nation the forces of ignorance rallied to put down the threatening insurrection they had successfully throttled during the war . The censors stripped off their masks . In Knoxville , Tennessee , Miss Mary Boyce Temple advocated the suppression of Rain . She had , she admitted , never seen it , never read it ? had , in fact , never heard of Maugham 's short story . But , " We of the D.A.R . and the United Daughters of the Confederacy have had the advantages of education and travel and have been prepared for such things . . . . It is our duty to protect those who have not had our advantages . " On the floor of the Senate , Reed Smoot , of Utah , cried , " I would rather a child of mine take opium than read one of these books . . . . I would rather keep out a thousand , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt was not confined to the literati . Insurgents were popping up in almost every household , mascaraed , half dressed , and nicotine-besotted . Everywhere ? ideologically , socially , sartorially ? a generation was in revolt . Fanned by warmedover war fevers , the alarm against the threatening revolution spread . Designers of the " moral garment " began their bizarre campaign for modest dress among women . Preachers took the stump for celibacy . And everywhere ? in Centralia , Washington ; Albany , New York ; and South Braintree , Massachusetts ? an indignant citizenry moved against the Reds . Something , quite definitely , had happened . Mencken certainly did not approve of the younger generation . The new freedom of American women scandalized him quite as much as it did his neighbors . Companionatemarriage advocates , he felt , should be hanged . " I lament the spread of carnality in the fair republic , " he wrote Burton Rascoe . " Even the great city of Washington , I hear , is full of fornicators . " But the contest lured him , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the established and accepted , not the new and insurgent . He had been opposed to the established order for too long to line up with it . It was not a question of choosing sides .  | There had always been just two sides : 1VIencken 's and everyone else 's . It never occurred to him that his fight against intolerance would be interpreted by the victims of that intolerance as a friendly act . Had anyone told him he would be considered radical by the Mary Boyce Temples and Reed Smoots , he would have agreed instantly ; but had he known he would be considered a liberal by the young flappers in shortening skirts and their baggytrousered escorts , he would have been amazed . Not even his friends thought any such thing in that first year of the Harding regime , and certainly he was far too busy to reflect on it himself . NOW the pages of the Smart Set , the magazine he and George Jean Nathan edited , were set humming with the accumulated horsepower of the war years . Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in his way as were the flappers in theirs , he let go one mighty blast after another , leveling , for his readers , everything which had been sacred . It was not revenge he sought : Mencken 's compulsion was not that simple . Revenge implies a personal relationship which never existed between him and his enemies . His billingsgate was surely personal enough , but the motivation turned on an abstract hatred of what they represented , not a man-to-man dislike . He preferred , indeed , not to know his targets ; better , he felt , they should remain to him the caricatures they became to his readers . He was , it seemed , afraid he might , knowing them , get to like them . The end of the war meant more than a super-charged Mencken . It brought also a rechanneling of his energies . His prejudices ? he began thus to describe his attitudes ? broadened immensely . He began , as he wrote Carl Van Doren , to " sicken of belles-lettres " and became entranced with general imbecilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took in every aspect of the developing era , and gloated . When Harold E. Stearns began the exodus of American intellectuals in 1922 , Mencken obligingly wrote a section on politics for Civilization in the United States ; yet he himself remained , " on the dock , wrapped in the flag , when the Young Intellectuals set sail . " ... Here , more than anywhere else that I know of or have ever heard of , the daily panorama of human existence . . . is so inordinately gross and preposterous . . . that only a man who was born with a petrified diaphragm can fail to laugh himself to sleep every night , and to awake every morning with all the eager , unflagging expectation of a Sunday-school superintendent touring the Paris peep-shows . As the nation turned toward normalcy , Mencken greased his long idle bore , , primed his high-explosive shells , sighted in , and .. . WHAM ! " Nilson : the self-bamboozled Presbyterian , the right-thinker , the great moral statesman , the perfect model of a Christian cad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned and fermenting sex as the United States , plain fornication becomes a mark of relative decency . " WHAM !

" WHAM ! " It is still socially dangerous for an American man to have the reputation of being vir- tuous . Theoretically , he who preserves his chemical purity in the face of all temptations is a noble and upright fellow and the delight of the heavenly hierarchy ; actually , he is laughed at by women and viewed with contempt by men . " WHAM ! " All government , in its essence , is a conspiracy against the superior man : its one permanent object is to oppress him and cripple him . " WHAM ! On the evening of that same day that an American Legionary has his wages reduced to 40 per cent and his hours of labor increased 25 per cent , he goes out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather some visionary who tries to convince him he has been swindled . " WHAM ! WHAM ! WHAM ! Like a great peal of thunder , his invective rolled across the nation and broke with a tremendous roar , sending the selfappointed policemen of our moral and political standards scampering about to see what was the matter . He lumped the Ku Klux Klan , the American Legion , the Anti-Saloon League , and the Department of Justice together ? " all great engines of cultural propaganda " ? and spread before them the proposition that the one way to find the truth of anything in America was to take a vote on it . Criticism and progress , he had written a friend , " must be done boldly , and , to get a crowd , a bit cruelly . " Certainly he was cruel enough . The crowd was not far behind . In the newspapers , in the pulpit , and from the lecture platform , he was denounced as a mangy ape , a dog , a weasel , a maggot , a ghoul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger , a howling hyena , a bilious buffoon , a cad , a British toady , a super-Boche of German Kultur , a cankerworm , a radical Red , and a reactionary . " Shocking , " editorialized the Brooklyn Eagle ; " Improper , " said the Nashville Banner- ; " Insulting , " wrote " Outraged " to the Chicago Tribune . A North Carolina woman cried , " Away with the inhibition of inferiority this clever Hebrew would wish upon us ! " G. K. Chesterton summed him up as " a clever and bitter Jew in whom a real love of letters is everlastingly exasperated by the American love of cheap pathos and platitude . " His philosophy , to believe Chesterton , was a sort of nihilistic pride which belongs " to a man with a sensitive race and a dead religion . " In Chicago a college professor demanded of his siinpering class , " Can not America produce someone who will knock Mr. Mencken into a cocked hat , or at least smack his sassy face ? " In the midst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and a philologist , arrived in New York to take a chair at the University of Michigan as professor of English poetry . He was received by an august deputation from the American Institute and the American Academy of Arts and Letters at the dock , seen to his quarters , and asked , as a point of etiquette , if there were any names he cared to add to a prepared list of greeters . Bridges waved away the lists . " The only man I want to meet in America , " he said , " is H. L. Mencken . " As Burton Rascoe noted , from the expressions on the  | hosts ' faces , Bridges might just as well have said , " I am badly in need of a whore . Will you please get me one for the night ? " III THE medal had another side . The very violence of the attack on Mencken stemmed from concern over his widening and sympathetic audience , and if he had more vilifiers than ever he certainly had more admirers . The editors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never before existed , now quoted his praise of them freely ; the New Republic , despite editorial disclaimers , was delighted to get his copy ; Villard 's Nation made him contributing editor , with no duties beyond holding the title . A swarm of writers hustled to review his precepts ? Vincent O'Sullivan in the Mercure de France ; Frank Harris in Pearson 's Magazine ; Lawrence Gilman in the North American Review ; Percy Boynton in Freeman ; J. E. Spingarn in the London Nation ; Ernest Boyd in the Athenaeum and Freeman ; and Edmund Wilson in Dial and the New Republic . Why the hubbub ? Had Mencken changed so greatly ? He had not . He was , as noted , bolder than before , but neither his style nor his basic tenets had shifted appreciably since 1908 . It was intellectual America which had changed . Just as the Civil War had directed all the reform movements of the 1840 's and 1850 's into a crusade against slavery and secession , so had the war just past channeled the idealism of Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeat of the League of Nations ? " the old Peruna bottle , " Mencken called it ? came , and the wartime patriotism turned into normalcy , the jailing of Debs , and the rewriting of schoolbooks to conform with the fiats of the Ku Klux Klan and the D.A.R. , the reaction set in . Doughboys returned to a culture whose hero was Theodore Roosevelt , whose philosopher was William Jennings Bryan , whose high priest was Comstock , and whose religion was Do n't . And they rebelled . Thus did the twenties come to Mencken . The champion of intellectual unrest , of disillusion , he tapped this new vein with a flourish and a zeal which staggered the PhilInes and brought the jaded literati flocking . In the gaudy-covered Smart Set and in his stream of books and magazine articles , they found their unspoken thoughts brilliantly couched . When he beheld , " sweeping the eye over the land . . . a culture that , like the national literature , is in three layers ? the plutocracy on top , a vast mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a forlorn intelligentsia gasping out a precarious life in between , " the raccooncoated aesthete saw himself perfectly described . When Mencken ascended to the levels " where ideas swish by and men pursue truth to grab her by the tail , " the raccoon coat floated up with him . And when he cried , in his introduction to the revised In Defense of Women , " If I knew what was true , I 'd be willing to sweat and strive for it , and maybe even to die for it to the tune of bugle blasts . But so far , I have not found it , " the raccoon coat , mournfully sipping bathtub gin , sobbed , " Neither have I. " He was compared to Juvenal , Dryden , Swift , Voltaire , and , in the Glasgow Herald , to Sam Johnson . Overnight , it seemed , his fame became international . The Sydney , Australia , Times praised his honesty , the Deutsche Rundschau his satire , the Caracas , Venezuela , El Universal his power , and the Cartegena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the famous ? Hugh Walpole and Aldous Huxley ? and from the obscure ? a Chicago business man and an editorial writer on the Fargo , North Dakota , Tribune . He was translated into Spanish , German , Russian ; in Moscow an article telling of his fight for Russian realism was accompanied by a sketch of a squarejawed giant bearing the caption , " H. L. Mencken . " In Greenwich Village a red-haired. girl gained great favor by announcing she had been sleeping with Mencken for six years . ALL this delighted him , though he took it with small seriousness . The terrific publicity he welcomed as advertising ? an author , he noted , was most admired by those who had not read him but had merely heard of him . In 1922 he began subscribing to Romeike 's clipping service , carefully pasting the sheafs of newspaper articles in numbered scrapbooks . His audience he carefully cultivated . The name " H. L. Mencken " he cherished as a trademark ; his friends were  | advised that " Henry L. " was proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other criminal documents . " His early Ventures into Verse became something of a problem : the popularity of his first editions swept it into the first rank of rare books , and its harmless Kipling imitations , agreeable enough from an adolescent poet , became embarrassing to a famous critic . All requests for it , even from his closest friends , were turned aside with vague references to the bank vault where it was supposed to be kept . The Sundar Sun , when it began reprinting poems from it , received a cease-and-desist order from Hollins Street . In later years he strenuously protested that he never bought up copies in the second-hand book market , but at least one New York dealer who knew him remembers that he did . Inexplicably , one of the two copies in the Library of Congress disappeared . As a celebrity , he was subjected to certain annoyances . He generally took them goodhumoredly ; even the spurious Greenwich Village mistress amused him , and the persistent reports of his coming marriage , always attendant on a bachelor 's entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was some truth to the story ? in these years , there was none ? or turned it off with protests that it had killed his chances with another " fair creature " whom he had wooed to the brink of the altar . ( " After all , " he told Joseph Hergesheimer , " it is hard to prove that one is not married . I 'll have to hand her lawyers ' transcripts from every parish register in the United States since the year 1886 , when I attained to puberty . " ) There were many women in Mencken 's life in these years , but their position was sharply defined and almost extra-human . They provided admirable decoration ? bright , waxen figures who might stay only if they giggled appreciatively and kept their mouths shut ? but they did not alter his flippant view of love and marriage . III WHILE the storm raged about H. L. Mencken in many a far-flung pulpit . ' H. L. Mencken laid bricks and played with pet turtles . His back yard in Baltimore ? that narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pony stable ? had become , late in the war , a sort of private pasture to which he might retire with his thoughts , and he was now engaged in throwing up a sturdy brick wall on either side to insure privacy . The wooden fence on the north side of the yard was first torn down , and Mencken , trowel in one hand and cement can beside him , dug into a pile of bricks while his mother watched anxiously from the window . With the thoroughness which touched everything he did , he took to dropping in evenings at nearby Linder 's Saloon , the hang-out of Baltimore 's bricklayers ; now , with the information there gained , he went about the simple business of laying one brick on top of another . At first he did the thing very badly . His square , chunky hands ? bricklayer hands , they had told him down at Linder 's ? were forever getting in each other 's way or beneath a falling brick and became , under this constant mauling , all but unfit for weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expert , however , and slowly the wall rose , solid and erect , not an inch out of line . Still he was unsatisfied . He decided to become fancy ; Persian tiles were set into the brick , and a concrete fountain , his masterpiece , was lugged in from the back alley and installed . Visitors to Hollins Street were first shown the slackening of his convex waist , then led through the house to the back yard to see the fountain ? " It actually works . Is n't that amazing ? " ? and the wall which would be standing " when the rest of Baltimore is dust , " the long mass of bricks which was walling Mencken in and his neighbors out . The turtles came in 1921 , when his brother 's dog Tessie , " fifteen years old , and a virgin , " died . Mencken mournfully buried her in the yard , set a bronze plate in the wall overhead , and bought the new pets . Of an evening , before beginning the night 's work , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Sawyer , escorting him in and out of his little pen . A month or so after his acquisition , and to the great embarrassment of his owner , General Sawyer scandalized the family by laying three eggs . Next day he was renamed Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy . MENKENs income had now stabilized at six thousand dollars a year , and much of it was sunk into improving the home he never intended to leave . In the early 1920 's he had the house virtually rebuilt .  | New floors were put in , a larger kitchen was built on , the heating system was replaced , every new appliance which would lessen the burden of housekeeping for his sister and mother was installed , and in the third-floor workroom a washstand appeared , to facilitate the furious hand-washing sessions which always punctuated an evening of writing . Mencken particularly admired new plumbing : " I would n't swap an American bathroom for the Acropolis , " he wrote . Anna Mencken , now in her sixties , erect and dignified , presided over the house as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adored her . After a stag party downstairs , before going to bed , he scrupulously swept the floor , dusted the furniture , and washed and dried the dishes that she might not be annoyed in the morning . To his everlasting amusement , both his sister and his mother maintained that he was like all writers ? absent-minded , careless , and quite without ability to cope with the smaller businesses of life . " They never speak of my workroom save in terms of horror , though it is actually the most orderly room in the house . ' Veekly I am accused of having lost all my socks and handkerchiefs , though they are in my clothespress all the while . " Monthly , plans were made to organize his life , and he solemnly went along with the scheme , vowing to behave himself in the future ? to keep a record of where he left his undershirts , to abstain from dropping cigar ashes on the floor , to keep the floor visible in his office . " On my death-bed , I daresay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , I shall swallow a clinical thermometer or two , upset my clam-broth over my counterpane , keep a ouija board and a set of dice under my pillow , and maybe , at the end , fall clumsily out of bed . " To the third floor each morning now came his secretary , Miss Alice B. Deering , crisp and neat , notebook and pencils in hand . His enormous correspondence and the selfimposed need for answering each letter , no matter how absurd , in the return mail had made her necessary . The study had changed little : all four walls were lined with books now , and pictures of James Branch Cabell , Bismarck , and Mencken 's Leipzig ancestors ? the product of two years ' research by a firm specializing in tracing ancestry ? stood behind his desk . The letters were shorter now , however close a friend the correspondent ; there were too many , even with dictation . Otherwise , they had changed little . He voiced the usual imaginary physical complaints : a tumor had been dug out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital to have a folded membrane in his rectum investigated , or , depressed , was merely shipping out samples of his urine to all known pathologists . ( A note of desperation here : " I begin to believe that in the end , as the hearse approaches the crematory , I shall rise up and give three cheers . " ) Preposterous flights of fancy had long been his chief refuge in moods of artistic depression ; now he brought them up to date . He organized a spurious golf club , placed it near Richmond , had stationery printed , and recruited prominent Southerners to membership . The organization over , he sent out word that the club 's pro ? previously referred to only as " Sandy McTavish " ? was a Negro . He spread the rumor that Knopf was investing his money in taxicabs , chrome yellow , with green stripes and purple spots and a douche bag in every cab . And when , during the course of the Fatty Arbuckle case , the history of Miss Rappe 's bladder was spread throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were involved , asked them to write and tell him all about it , and promised , in any event , to do his best to keep their names out of the papers . He made small concessions to fame . Invitations to speak ? even a thirty-thousand-dollar , six-week lecture tour offer , made jointly to Mencken and Nathan ? were spurned . In Baltimore he consented to appear twice yearly , at City College , a public high school , and at Goucher College for women , and then he agreed only with the understanding that the talks would approach the absolute in informality . His addresses at Goucher , which began in 1923 , were advertised among the students as esoteric comments on this or that philosophy , but the topic was always the same : How to Catch Husbands . He treated such occasions far more lightly than the least of his family obligations . Life at home had stabilized for the first time since his father 's death , and Mencken , a strong believer in the family circle , meant to see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them presents , held forth at the table , and entertained them with stories of the morons in New York . Once , he almost blew them up . TtTtiE explosion ? it seems no exaggeration to call it that ? came as the climax of a long series of events , directly connected with , and in flagrant violation of , the Eighteenth Amendment . The great drought , or , as Mencken was pleased to call it , the Horror , began on January 16 , 1920 , but his concern with it began long before that . To one so given to the pleasures of good liquors , the approach of the noble experiment loomed as a ghastly and indescribable thing . He kept mum in the Smart Set , unable to find words apt to the crime , and watched the distillers like a cat . Presently he headed north to rally Nathan and Tom Smith of the Century for the trying days ahead . Smith hired the biggest automobile he could find in Greater New York , and he , Mencken , and Nathan toured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocked his fiat , Nathan his apartment , and Mencken , back in Baltimore , filled the house so completely " that the bottles clink every time I walk across the floor . " He did more . One corner of his cellar was set aside for wines , and he began at once to import the cheap synthetic stuff which already issued from Hoboken , New Jersey . In late January 1920 a Baltimore wine dealer went out of business , and Mencken , who arranged to be on hand at the right moment , bought up his stock of Rhine wine and French red wine labels . These were pasted on the Hoboken sewage , giving him a cellar with an imposing look , if a metallic : taste . The Saturday and Sunday Night Clubs of his Baltimore friends met in joint session at Hollins Street to mourn the closing of the bars and debate the future . A rapid inventory disclosed they had enough gin to last two years and some seven hundred bottles of beer . They decided to go underground . Future meetings would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn and each host responsible for the evening 's refreshment . Did anyone know how to brew beer ? Everyone looked at Mencken . He was the great hymner of Pilsner . Besides , he was a graduate of the Polytechnic where , someone vaguely suggested , you learned how to do things . Well , did he ? Sure , he blustered . Nothing simpler . Leave it to Heine . Forthwith he bought a vast number of bottles , retired to the kitchen , and began mixing and stirring , mixing and stirring . When the beer had fermented for what seemed a reasonable time , and after an examination by " Gustav Kabernagel , the wellknown urinalysist , " he bottled it and ? this from a graduate of the Polytechnic , mind you ? and put it out in the back yard . He had , his brother August told him later in a postmortem . made two major mistakes : he had bottled it too soon and had left it precisely where the early summer sun would strike it most sharply . The day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on hand for a swell treat . Later in the day , the first thirsty arrivals rang the bell by the old brass door-plate . As they entered the vestibule , a muffled thunder , followed by a tinny rattling , as of shrapnel , came from the back yard . Everyone flinched . Mencken stood motionless . Then , as he turned toward the inside of the house , another explosion followed , and then another , and then another . Hard by Tessie 's memorial , a few feet from the wall fountain , all hell had broken loose . Everyone took cover ; then , as the sounds of battle rolled away , August , wearing boxing gloves and carrying a screen before him , went out to investigate . The entire batch , except for a few bottles , was ruined . It was on this evidence that Mencken , in his memoirs , claimed , " I was , so far as I have been able to discover , the first man south of the Mason-Dixon Line to brew a drinkable home brew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until in January 1922 , after a devastating visit by Sinclair Lewis , he had touched bottom . No more did the bottles clink as he walked across the floor ; indeed , it took long , awful minutes of persistent searching to turn up anything at all . Then it was he decided to build a real cellar , fit to cope with any emergency . Concrete , a foot thick , was poured ; the walls were covered with skulls and crossbones , and on the door was written the legend : " WARNING : Tampering with this gate will release chlorine gas under 250 pounds pressure . " In desperation , he spent his mornings building shelves inside and his afternoons decanting , filtering , doctoring , labeling , and tasting the precious little that was left . Mencken contacted every reliable bootlegger in Baltimore and set up a satisfactory arrangement with a Philadelphia author for shipments of bathtub gin . He seemed to get a tremendous pleasure out of guarded telephone conversations with his suppliers , and went so far as to procure a false nose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set and Prejudices , he waged a campaign to solve the problems of the human race by getting everyone gently stewed . The bootlegger became a mock hero to his readers . " Think of him , " he wrote , creeping in his motorboat on Christmas Eve , risking his life that the greatest of Christian festivals may be celebrated in a Christian and respectable manner ! Think of him soaked and freezing , facing his exile and its hardships uncomplainingly , that his mother may escape the poor farm , that his wife may have her operation for gall-stones , that his little children may be decently fed and clad , and go to school regularly , and learn the principles of Americanism ! . . . On the roaring deep there are still men who are colossally he , and when the bugle calls they will not fail . V His formal adjustment from war to post-war tempo had come late in 1919 , when he had rejoined the Baltimore Sun . Deeply hurt by the hands-off treatment he had received from the paper during the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to return fulltime at one hundred fifty dollars a week ? just three times his salary in 1916 . He believed he had outgrown his old paper , and in this he was quite right . But powerful forces of habit were working on him , and his old cronies at the Sun were anxious to please . After some haggling , he agreed to act as general editorial adviser , with a fat retainer and the understanding his work would involve no more than a few hours a month . Successful in this , the Sun pressed him to write some articles . Mencken wobbled slightly ; he was finally won over by the prospect of Wilson 's retirement from the political scene and the consequent reversion of the Sun to an anti-administration organ , a role far more suited to Mencken 's liking . He began writing essays for the Monday editorial page of the evening paper after the manner of his Smart Set editorials and in the vein and style of his old " Free Lance " column , and when Paul Patterson , the publisher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been covered by any other paper , proposed to send him along with the crew of Sun men , he was quite agreeable . He was ? but of the rest of the crew , it developed , many were not . Woodrow Wilson lay broken and dying in Washington , but in the offices of the Sun he remained to some the same warrior of idealism who had triumphed so splendidly in Baltimore eight years before . Men like John  | Owens and John Haslup Adams of the Sun staff were extremely sensitive about the President 's defeat in Congress and viewed the return of so rude and outspoken an enemy of the New Freedom as Mencken with grave misgivings . They were willing he should come along to Chicago for the Republican convention , however , until the week before the trip was to begin . On that Monday , Mencken , with sublime indifference to the feeling against him , wrote a bitter piece describing the President as a " congenital liar . " For Owens and Adams this was too much . They stormed into the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name were withdrawn from the convention roster . Open rebellion seemed at hand , and Patterson called Mencken to talk it over . Mencken offered to retire from the trip ? pointing out , however , that the Sun had been under no obligation to print the piece ? but Patterson would have none of it . Everyone , he decided , would go along . In addition , he would send a case of 100-proof hooch . An armed truce arranged , Patterson left for the convention . The others were to follow . The booze turned the trick ? that and an absurd little jingle Mencken chanted in rhythm with the humming of the Pullman 's wheels . On the train Owens refused to speak to him at first , but once the suitcase was opened and the singing begun . Wilson , the treaty , and the New Freedom were forgotten . Mencken , the battered old portable by his seat , his shirt open , threw back his spherical head and let go : Sing , Oh Sing ! Of Lydia Pinkham , Pinkham , Pinkham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race She can cure all female weakness And the pimples on your face . In Chicago Patterson called the hotel to find out what had happened on the train . Owens answered the phone . " Is everything quiet ? " asked the publisher . " Quiet ! " came the answer . " My God ! " And in the background came the swelling refrain , Sing , Oh Sing ! ( Yes , singosing ! ) of Lydia Pinkham , Pinkham , Pinkham And her love ( altruistic love ! ) of the human race , race , race She can cure ( bio-log-i-cally ! ) all female weakness And the pimples on - our god-damned dir-ty face . Wilson lived three and a half years ; but so far as Mencken was concerned , he died in that boozy Chicago hotel room . MENCKEiN returned from the Chicago convention on the same car with Henry Cabot Lodge , whom he admired enormously , and laid away whiskey against the Democratic show in San Francisco . As it turned out , this was unnecessary . The San Franciscans had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week there , for Mencken , was a superb circus . The weather was delightful ? it had been terribly hot in Chicago ? the liquor was abundant , and the women were most amiable . His most remarkable adventure while there was to wake up one morning in an unfamiliar bed in the same room with a strange but not unlovely woman . Thinking her to be a cheap tart he must have picked up during the hazy evening , he jumped into his spacious pants and fled down the stairs . Later in the day , however , he discovered her to be a respectable San Franciscan , a Democrat who had seen him floundering in a pitiable condition and had decided to care for him " in a Christian manner . " Mencken promptly betook himself to the nearest florist 's shop and sent her a large and fragrant bouquet . At the climax of the convention , the band broke into a series of tunes honoring Al Smith , and Mencken , singing with the convention , pounced up on a chair , grabbed a baton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side , West Side , " " Little Annie Roonie , " and " Tammany . " The breakdown of reserve in the midst of political chicanery was to him a wonderful thing , and those in attendance remember him best on that chair , waving the baton , tremendous joy written on his face . All , that is , save the respectable woman Democrat who cared for him in a Christian manner .  |
