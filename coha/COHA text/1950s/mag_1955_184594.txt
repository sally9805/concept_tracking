JUDGMENTS &; PROPHECIES <P> The New York Herald Tribune 's COLUMNIST ROSCOE DRUMMOND : <P> THERE is an important political postscript to be written out of the summit conference at Geneva . Have the Russians been able to persuade President Eisenhower to run in 1956 ? I am sure that he is nearer today to decision to stand for re-election than he was before he sat down at the conference table . <P> This conference put in train a series of big-power negotiations which will take two to four years to complete and which may determine the shape of the peace for a long time to come . If it is true-and I think it is-that Mr. Eisenhower will seek a second term only if he 's convinced that through another four years in the White House he could make a contribution to peace peculiarly his own , then Geneva produced new factors which , far more than theoretical arguments , could be decisive . After the hardest days of the Big Four discussions , Mr. Eisenhower appeared more full of zest , more rested , more tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because he was doing the thing on which , above all else , his heart and mind are set : to try to set the world on the pathway to better peace and to build an unpassable roadblock in front of a possibly hydrogen war . <P> Scripps-Howard Foreign Editor Emeritus WILLIAM PHILIP SIMMS : <P> THE United States and the West today face the most hazardous period since the end of World War II . Russia never has been as dangerous as she is right now . At this moment , even the best-informed can do no more than guess at Russia 's real intentions . Everybody is saying : " Russia has changed . " And so she has . Until a few weeks ago her face wore a perpetual scowl . Today it is all smiles . <P> But why ? Nobody outside the Kremlin can say for sure . But there is every reason to believe her real , ultimate objective remains the same as always-to set up a universal Communist dictatorship run from Moscow . She thinks she can make better progress by concealing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more subtle art of poison . By lulling the West she can revert to her early plot to gain control of the world by infiltration , through her fifth columns and similar subversive agents trained in Moscow . <P> By adopting a " new look " she can more easily beguile our European allies into believing Soviet Russia is more sinned against than sinning . She thus can elbow the United States out of the Eastern Hemisphere , dismember NATO , neutralize Western Europe , and put across her fake peace-and-disarmament plan which , once completed , would leave her mistress of the world .. Such is the peril . Fortunately , President Eisenhower sees it quite clearly . <P> CHICAGO TRIBUNE : <P> WE think that the principal result of the European sojourn has been to fortify Mr. Eisenhower 's political position immeasurably . People are disposed to credit him with sincere and decent instincts , and if he accomplished nothing that is visible , at least he managed to extricate himself from a conference with the Russians without getting trimmed . In view of the performance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be despised . <P> London 's anti-American NEW STATESMAN AND NATION :
