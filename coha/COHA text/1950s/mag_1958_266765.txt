Sociologists as well as fiction writers often deal with the problem of prostitution , but there have been remarkably few psychological studies of the subject . This week Manhattan Psychoanalyst Harold Greenwald published a searching analysis of a group of prostitutes , their motivations and emotional problems ( The Call Girl ; Ballantine , $4.50 ) . Greenwald 's is a highly specialized sample from the profession 's top economic stratum . Six call girls went to him for analysis ; he personally interviewed ten more ; and ten others ( too gun-shy to face him ) were interviewed by three of the call girls themselves . Because the findings were surprisingly uniform , he feels that they are valid . <P> Family Faades . Predictably , most of the girls had miserable childhoods ; three-fourths came from homes broken by separation or divorce . The rest had viewed their homes as faades , papier-mach creations erected to cover a desiccated relationship , devoid of love between father and mother . Since most had seen their fathers leave home , their mothers had never made them feel welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage and desperation , some girls turned hopefully to their fathers-not in an Oedipal attachment , but in hopes of nurture which , again , was denied them . <P> The girls were emotionally adrift , had no clear concept of their predestined female role . Half of them had precocious sex experiences , soon realized that sex was a commodity with which they could bargain for the longed-for emotional contact , and also for more tangible rewards . Three-fourths were above average intelligence ; nearly all had ten to twelve years of schooling . One wrote songs , another designed hats , four painted , three wrote poetry , and two tried to write books . <P> Info the D.A.R . As call gir s in big cities , they commanded a minimum of $20 ( and up to $100 ) per " sexual contact , " averaged $20.000 a year each . But none had turned prostitute mainly for money ; some of them came from well-heeled homes . When they emphasized the importance of money . Analyst Greenwald found , they were rationalizing their step . <P> Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they paraded in mink coats and made a point of being seen riding in Cadillacs from expensive apartments in the best parts of town , they were forever afraid that the world was ready to laugh at them . To dull their anxiety they sought relief in drink ( though none was technically an alcoholic ) ; 15 used marijuana , and six took to heroin . Said one : " Being a call girl helped me overcome my inferiority complex . I used to feel very unattractive to men , but since so many of them want to pay me ... I guess I ca n't be all that unattractive . " Largely because of their uncertainty about father and mother . 15 of the 20 had homosexual relations . None of the girls had any capacity for solid friendships , sought out friends who were unstable because of similar emotional conflicts . Yet they desperately wanted to conform in some outward respects : one joined the D.A.R . and the United Daughters of the Confederacy . <P> " It 's Not Sex . " None of the girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those with creative ability had such a short attention span that they could not stick at their avocations ; the rest had difficulty watching a TV program through , or reading for more than a few minutes .
