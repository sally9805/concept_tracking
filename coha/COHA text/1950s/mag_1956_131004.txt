There were a near-record 18 colts on the track , the winner of the race had three times in the past four years gone on to win the Kentucky Derby  --  but before last week 's Santa Anita Derby , not a horseman in habitually ebullient California was brave enough to come right out and say there was a Kentucky threat in the starting gate at Arcadia . // After the race , they were n't sure they did n't have one , after all  --  in the horse that finished fourth . Coming up from eighth place in the last quarter mile with an eye-opening rush , Like Magic , a full brother to Swaps , completely stole the show . // The race was won by Rex Ellsworth 's Terrang , but that seemed merely incidental , judging from the excited horsemen 's chatter . It is Like Magic who has set California 's heart beating faster . Terrang , his stablemate , for all his winning ways is highly disregarded . // The story of Terrang at Santa Anita this winter could almost be tear-in-the-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish line . // This plucky little colt , a nondescript brown-black who hangs his head like a punished dog between races , has done everything asked of him by his owner-trainer since he was first set on the track . He won two stakes , finished second in another and third in another , all the while giving away as much as 16 pounds to his contemporaries , no small task for a horse barely 3 . The only time he was an also-ran , he had an excuse as good as horse racing excuses can be : he would have needed a scythe to cut his way out of the wall of horses pinning him in on the turn and in the drive . // Yet Terrang has still to have an audible good word said about him by either his owners or the press or , for that matter , the clockers or jockeys . No matter how hard he tries , Like Magic still eclipses him . // The first week of the meeting ( on the last day of the year ) , he beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " If we got a Kentucky Derby horse this year , it 's Like Magic , " he predicted . Terrang went on to prove himself the most consistent 3-year-old at Santa Anita by far . His reward was a chorus of yawns . " He does n't look like a mile-and-a-quarter horse to me , " said the Mirror-News ' Bob Hebert . Others were downright scornful . " Ellsworth better hope Like Magic develops into a Derby horse , " was the contemptuous opinion of the never-wrong clockers. // Before the race last Saturday over a mile and an eighth , Charlie Whittingham , a rival trainer , insulted not only Terrang but every other horse in the race . " No , I do n't have a Kentucky Derby horse today , and neither does anyone else in here , " he snapped . Trainer Whittingham might have been twice wrong . His Social Climber  --  a $112 payoff in his only stakes this year  --  finished an electrifying second and there were supporters holding their heads in anguish that Owner Liz Whitney Lunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // On Derby day last Saturday , Owner Ellsworth and Trainer Tenney put star Jockey Willie Shoemaker on Terrang through no respect for the colt but " only because he 's harder to handle than Like Magic . " // But the public was not so bearish . Not caring a hang about a Kentucky Derby two months away , it cold-bloodedly made Terrang a 2-to-1 favorite  --  a rare tribute in a field so large that the starting gate stretched from infield to grandstand rail . And Terrang did not disappoint his public . Neither , however , did he impress his critics . Enjoying equal weight with his competition for the first time since he turned 3 , he ran a methodical , businesslike race which satisfied the bettors if not the experts . He came out of the gate slowly but was soon stalking the flashy front-runner , Blen Host , a Your Host colt who behaved like one , with the doggedness of the inspector from Scotland Yard who knows his quarry is merely prolonging the inevitable . // The inevitable happened at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the faultfinding . At the finish , even Jockey Shoemaker got into the act . " I was having to hit him Terrang left-handed , right-handed  --  everything I could to make him run , " he complained . // The point was that , even if he was tiring , Terrang did run  --  as usual . But as he swept across the finish line to win a mere $111,700 for his owners , it seemed they were looking right past him down the track . Their smiles were for Like Magic , who was finishing fourth . // BACK TO OBLIVION // In the press box afterward , Ellsworth and Tenney glowed  --  about Like Magic . " We were delighted , " enthused Tenney  --  about Like Magic , even as they were peeling the chrysanthemum blanket off Terrang and letting him mope back to the barns and renewed oblivion . // Like Magic may well be the Ellsworth main chance at Kentucky in May . He did indicate his puppy days are behind him . That he was still two lengths behind Terrang at the wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anybody can see how a big ugly duckling like him Like Magic should develop , " protested Mish Tenney after the race . // Well , someone wanted to know , had n't Terrang run  --  all things considered  --  a more creditable race than Swaps last year ? After all , Swaps had won his race by half a length in 1:50 ; Terrang had won by a length and a quarter in 1:51 on a track that was obviously slower than last year . " Swaps was only a half-fit horse this time last year , " exclaimed Tenney . " Terrang is dead fit . " // " Of course , " added Tenney , who is shipping to Florida this week , " they tell me there are n't any Nashuas on the track down in Florida this year .... " But even then it was clear the faraway look in his eyes was for Like Magic . // After the race , Tenney and Ellsworth confirmed that they were going to fly a string of horses , including Terrang and Like Magic , to Florida Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stablemate : the electrifying part of the news was that Swaps might be the sixth horse in the consignment ( the other three will be Lover 's Aid , Barely Nothing and Airide ) . Did this mean there was still hope Swaps would challenge Nashua on St. Patrick 's Day ? // " There would be no other reason for flying him down , " said Ellsworth firmly . Tenney remained silent .
