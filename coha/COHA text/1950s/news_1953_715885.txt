txt Too many potatoes  --  some of doubtful quality  --  have posed a huge problem for Maine growers . Ideal weather and other factors combined to produce a bunter crop of 58,000,000 bushels-11 per cent greater than the 1952 harvest . Prices have just about dropped out of the bottom of the potato barrels . A year ago , growers received about $5 a barrel . Today , they are fortunate if they get a dollar . Aroostook County bankers ha 've indicated that losses this year may run as high as $25 , - 000,000 . Credit will in 1954 , they add . Sales promotion plans already are under way . They may help some . But , the general consensus is that Maine potato people must do better by consumers . Demand Declines The most challenging problem is to market this huge surplus of spuds in the face of a steadily declining demand . Per capita consumption has dropped from about 200 pounds a year to 100 pounds  --  for numerous reasons , But , there are hopes for improvements in the situation . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take too big a shellacking this marketing season , I believe we arc on our way to a much better quality product and a much more aggressive effort to develop markets than has been the case for a long time . " Actually , despite this year 's oversupply , the potato industry 's long-range problem is not primarily one of overproduction . Rather , it is one of underconsumption . Nearly everyone recalls the situation only a year or two ago when potatoes were scarce , and rise and spaghetti were urged as substitutes . Campaign Slated In a renewed effort to put this year 's big potato crop onto the tables of the nation 's homes and public eating houses , the National Potato Council has launched a potato promotion campaign , aimed at increasing the per capita con5umption . Cooperating in an intensified merchandising campaign ? scheduled for the weeks of Dec. 3 to 12 ? will be the National Association of Food Chains , the National Association of Retail Grocers , along with other retailers , wholesalers , distributors , restaurant and hotel groups , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support this program to the fullest , and to give housewives new methods for using potatoes as budget balancers . Better Quality However , in this particular effort it is pointed out that there also must be a greater effort on the part of the growers to market better quality potatoes . The average consumer , it is added , knows nothing of inspection , grading standards , branding laws , the problems of storage or shipping . or the difference between a cull and a U.S. No. 1  --  and neither is he or she greatly interested in these matters . The average housewife does not know a Katandin or a Green ' Mountain from an Ontario by appearance . But  --  she does know that some , potatoes . " taste like soap " and that others are dark when they are cooked . And , she frequently finds too many bruises , which mean waste to her . The potato industry ? it is emphasized  --  must pay more atten- , , tion to what the customer wants . This is the first of a series of tlIree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
