For the first time in six months , the nation 's stalled railroads showed signs of picking up speed . Freight carloadings jumped 7% in a fortnight , hit a 1958 high of 612,715 cars . The rise was in all types of freight , with the most significant gain in wheat shipments . Railroadmen expect that wheat shipments will reach a peak around July 4 , stay high as the U.S. harvests its fourth fattest crop in history . <P> Good news also came from Washington . The rail relief bill ( TIME , May 5 ) rode through the Senate , and a similar bill unanimously passed the House Commerce Committee . Both bills 1 ) provide for the U.S. to guarantee private loans to the rails ( the Senate set a $700 million limit , but the House set no ceiling ) , 2 ) give greater power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to reduce service on money-losing routes . 3 ) tighten up on truckers now exempt from ICC rate regulations . Since chances seemed good that a relief bill would become law within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The Dow-Jones rail index closed at the year 's high of 119.21 , up 19.32 points from the low in January . <P> For the ailing , n 2-year-old Pennsylvania Railroad , " this is going to be the worst year . " The 1958 deficit , said Vice President David C. Bevan last week , will top the $4,048,000 loss of 1946 , only other year that the Pennsy was in the red . The line has lost money for seven straight months , and " July will be very bad . "
