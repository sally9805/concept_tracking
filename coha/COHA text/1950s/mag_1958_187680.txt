Watermelons on ice , fiddle music by the Clinch Mountain Clan and country songs by Grand Ole Opry stars brought out the voters 500 strong one hot night last week in East Ridge , Tenn. ( 1950 pop . 9,645 ) . After a sample of the most lavish Democratic primary campaign that local politicians could remember , Millionaire Segregationist Prentice Cooper , 62 , three-time Governor ( 1939-45 ) and Harry Truman 's Ambassador to Peru ( 1946-48 ) , poured it on incumbent U.S. Senator Albert Gore . " He is drawing $75 a day to represent the people of Tennessee , " bellowed Cooper in a stomping cadence , " but he is supporting a oneworld , do-gooder , global-giveaway policy which has squandered the resources of the nation . " Why , Gore even voted for reciprocal trade , in spite of the state 's textile mills . <P> Cooper 's fist clinched around his ultimate weapon : a battered copy of the Southern Manifesto . Gore 's refusal to join 19 other Dixie Senators in this 1956 blast against civil rights made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who swore that his first official act would be to sign it. * Cheered by Orval Faubus ' landslide just across the Mississippi , Cooper 's rednecks promised to prove that only stout segregationists can now win primaries below the Mason-Dixon . But at vote-counting time in the as-good-as-elected Democratic primary late last week , Albert Gore was renominated with 60% of the total , and swamped Cooper-watermelons , manifestoes and all-under a bigger vote than he dredged up to overturn the late Kenneth D. McKellar in 1952 . <P> After the Faubus fright ( TIME , Aug. 11 ) , Northern editorialists happily hailed a big victory for moderation . In fact , it was more a personal victory for forthright Albert Gore than for moderation . Largely unnoted was the sobering point that the Governor 's power , which made Arkansas ' Faubus far more of a Southern hero than any Senator , was won by Buford Ellington , 50 , former state commissioner of agriculture and campaign manager for Governor Frank Clement . <P> Ellington ran as " an old-fashioned segregationist " with Clement 's support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a four-man , winner-take-all primary , Ellington 's band snatched a last-minute victory from Memphis ' Gore-like Reform Mayor Edmund Orgill , after rednecks blanketed rural West Tennessee with pictures of Orgill talking with Negro " friends during N.A.A.C.P. organizational meeting " ( actually , he was talking to a nonpartisan civic-improvement group ) . Additional point for sign readers to note : victorious Segregationist Ellington and more rabid Candidate Andrew T. Taylor between them rolled up 61% of the vote in once moderate Tennessee . <P> <P> *Scripps-Howard 's Knoxville News-Sentinel reported , after searching Washington for the original document , that Cooper might need the whole six-year term to find it .
