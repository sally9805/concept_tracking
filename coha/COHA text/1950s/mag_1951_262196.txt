Karen Killilea is a freckle-nosed little girl of eleven who falls down more than most youngsters : she has cerebral palsy . Like many another young palsy patient , she has been wearing a football helmet to protect her head . But a helmet is hot and heavy . Karen 's father , a Manhattan engineer , took a better idea to Cavanagh 's , the Park Avenue hatters . Last week Karen was wearing a jaunty cap . Built with a core of laminated plastic , it gives just as much protection as the helmet , and everybody , including Karen , thinks it is a lot more becoming . The United Cerebral Palsy Association is spreading the news of Karen 's new cap ( cost : about $18 ) to member organizations across the U.S.
