The rumbling that woke up the 1958 congressional election campaign last week was the sound of short-lived but sharp public argument between the President and Vice President of the U.S. The argument : Is the Administration 's handling of foreign policy-and specifically the Quemoy-Matsu crisis-a proper topic for campaign debate ? President Eisenhower , even though he agreed with G.O.P. leaders at the White House a fortnight before that foreign policy is one of the campaign 's two top issues ( the other : the economy ) , said flatly one day last week that " Foreign policy ought to be kept out of partisan debate . " <P> Vice President Nixon , out campaigning in San Francisco , flatly disagreed . His points : 1 ) U.S. foreign policy is a proper topic for U.S. debate , and 2 ) the Eisenhower-Dulles record is the G.O.P. 's great asset and great hope to turn back the Democratic tide . Nixon 's argument : " A policy of firmness when dealing with the Communists is a peace policy . A policy of weakness is a war policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or territory . " <P> The political fact that underlay the rumbling was that the Vice President , on the campaign front , was in vigorous dissent from the President 's kind of above-the-battle political leadership . " There has developed in recent years , " said Nixon in Salt Lake City , " the unsound idea that hard-hitting debate on the issues which confront the country is somehow wrong and detrimental to the best interests of the nation . We need more of this kind of debate in this country , both in and out of political campaigns , rather than less . " <P> Debate calendar : Saturday . The Democratic Advisory Council-including Harry Truman , Dean Acheson , Adlai Stevenson-put out a razor-sharp statement that the U.S. ought to turn over the Quemoy-Matsu crisis to the U.N. , ought to have a plebiscite in Formosa ( no mention of the same thing for Red China ) , also slashed at " world-ambulating " Secretary of State Dulles for dragging the U.S. to " the brink of having to fight a nuclear war . " The Advisory Council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there may be dangerous times when an opposition ought to keep quiet , the Quemoy-Matsu crisis " is not such a case . " <P> Monday . Vice President Nixon , then in Chicago , cut back at the Democrats : " In a nutshell , the Acheson foreign policy resulted in war and the Eisenhower-Dulles policy resulted in peace . I challenge every Democratic candidate for the House and Senate to state unequivocally whether he favors a continuation of the Eisenhower foreign policy . . . military strength and diplomatic firmness . . . or a return to the Acheson policy . . . retreat and appeasement.
