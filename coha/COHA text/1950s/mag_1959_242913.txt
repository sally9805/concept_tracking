As the limousines rolled up , one after another , the honor guard posted before Washington 's vast , columned Interdepartmental Auditorium repeatedly sprang to attention . Inside the hushed hall a loudspeaker announced each arrival : Premier Manouchehr Eghbal of Iran , Premier Adnan Menderes of Turkey , Foreign Minister Manzur Qadir of Pakistan , British Ambassador to the U.S. Sir Harold Caccia . With all due pomp , the U.S. last week was playing host to the semiannual Ministerial Council of CENTO , the Baghdad-less Baghdad Pact . <P> As it often does , pomp concealed a certain lack of substance . When revolutionary Iraq walked out of the Baghdad Pact last March , the remaining members along the strategic Northern Tier of the Middle East-Turkey , Iran and Pakistan - were badly shaken . To reassure them , the U.S. hastily signed bilateral defense treaties with each . ( Unlike Britain , which is a full partner , the U.S. has consistently refused formal membership in the pact for fear of stirring up new resentment in India , Israel and most of the Arab states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters from Baghdad to Ankara , and rustled up a new name : the Central Treaty Organization . <P> A Matter of Muscle . But even in its new guise , the pact retained many of its old weaknesses . Though it has to its credit the improvement of transport and communications lines between its Middle Eastern members , CENTO still has no unified military command ; the real muscle guarding the Northern Tier is supplied by the bilateral U.S. treaties . And CENTO still has a soft spot in Iran , where Russian pressure alternates between threats and blandishments in an effort to force Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi into the neutralist path . <P> At the Washington meeting , Pakistan 's M.O.A. Baig , CENTO 's secretary-general , insisted : " Iran is not , repeat not , in a shaky position . " But CENTO and the U.S. were sufficiently concerned so that late in the week Dwight Eisenhower issued an unusual statement stressing " the gravity with which the U.S. would view a threat to the territorial integrity or political independence of Iran . " <P> Limited Underwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual , Pakistan 's Qadir at last week 's session urged the U.S. to abandon the fiction that it is not a full member of the pact , and Iran 's Eghbal outspokenly demanded more U.S. and British aid . But the U.S. had already pumped $470 million into CENTO 's three Middle Eastern members in fiscal 1959 . " Clearly , the U.S. can not underwrite all CENTO economic projects , " said Secretary of State Christian Herter . Imperfect as CENTO may be , however , the U.S. could not abandon it without shaking the free world 's strategic position in the Middle East , and Herter also made it plain that he was aware of that . Said he : " CENTO will continue to enjoy strong U.S. support . "
