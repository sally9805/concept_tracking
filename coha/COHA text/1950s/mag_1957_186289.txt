In other moves on the world 's multidimensional diplomatic chessboard , U.S. diplomacy last week : <P> Joined Britain at the United Nations in backing France 's claim that France should be allowed to settle her problems in rebellious Algeria in her own way ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Thus standing off the Afro-Asian bloc 's demands for an immediate Algerian cease-fire and elections , the U.S. served notice that it does not intend to carry its enthusiasm for burgeoning independence movements to the extreme of upsetting well-established friendly governments . <P> Agreed on a meeting between President Eisenhower and France 's Premier Guy Mollet , in Washington , Feb. 26 and 27 , and a meeting between Ike and Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan , in Bermuda ( at Ike 's suggestion ) , March 21 through 24 . One point up for discussion in Bermuda : a proposal by the financially pressed Macmillan government that 1 ) the British cut the strength of their four NATO divisions by up to 30,000 men , and 2 ) the U.S. make up the difference in firepower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Announced , in line with President Eisenhower 's determination to help Poland 's new government maintain its independence from Russian domination , that at U.S. invitation Warsaw has agreed to send a Polish mission to economic talks in Washington in the near future . Chief item likely to be negotiated : a request by the hard-pressed Gomulka government for a big ( at least $100 million ) loan to finance the purchase of U.S. surplus agricultural products , farm and mining machinery , fertilizers . <P> Scrutinized , as it prepared to take part in still another round of U.N . disarmament talks , a new version of the Soviet proposal - turned down by President Eisenhower last month-for a summit meeting to discuss arms reduction . Gist of the new proposal : foreign ministers and top-ranking military chiefs should attend the U.N . Disarmament Subcommittee when it reconvenes in London next month . Initial Washington reaction was cool . Reasons : the Russian proposal , coming two days after Moscow announced a cut in defense spending , seemed designed to 1 ) dramatize recent Soviet calls for uninspected arms reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms as Moscow 's larger propaganda objective , a new meeting of heads of state . <P> Agreed , after consultation with West European representatives , to supply the proposed six-nation European atomic pool with whatever U.S. technical aid and nuclear fuel is necessary to help build a massive ( 15 million-kw. ) atomic-power industry in Western Europe by 1967 . Among the U.S. 's objectives in pledging such fabulous support : an increase in Western Europe 's " solidarity , " a decrease in its dependence on foreign fuel , particularly from the Middle East .
