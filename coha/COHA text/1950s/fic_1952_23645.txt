Journey with a Lady A Story by Shirley Jackson Drawings by Andy Warhol H g , 64 ONEY , " Mrs. Wilson said uneasily , are you sure you 'll be all right ? " " Sure , " said Joseph . He backed away quickly as she bent to kiss him again . " Listen , Mother , " he said . " Everybody 's look-ing. - " I 'm still not sure but what someone ought to go with him , " said his mother . " Are you sure he 'll he all right ? " she said to her husband . " Who , Joe ? " said Mr. Wilson . " He 'll be fine , wo n't you , son ? " " Sure , " said Joseph . " A boy nine years old ought to be able to travel by himself , " said Mr. Wilson , in the patient tone of one who has been saying these same words over and over for several days to a nervous mother . Mrs. Wilson looked up at the train , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But suppose something should happen ? " she asked . " Look , Helen , " her husband said , " the train 's going to leave in about four minutes . His bag is already on the train , Helen . It 's on the seat where he 's going to be sitting from now until he gets to Merrytown . I have spoken to the porter and I have given the porter a couple of dollars , and the porter has promised to keep an eye on him and see that he gets off the train with his bag when the train stops at Merrytown . He is nine years old , Helen , and he knows his name and where he 's going and where he 's supposed to get off , and Grandpop is going to meet him and will telephone you the minute they get to Grand-pop 's house , and the porter ? " " I know , " said Mrs. Wilson , " but are you sure he 'll be all right ! " Mr. Wilson and Joseph looked at one another briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's momentary lapse of awareness to put her arm around his shoulders and kiss him again , although he managed to move almost in time and her kiss landed somewhere on the top of his head . " Mother , " Joseph said ominously . " Do n't want anything to happen to my little boy , " Mrs. Wilson said , with a brave smile . " Mother , for heaven 's sake , " said Joseph . " I better get on the train , " he said to his father . " Good idea , " said his father . " ' By , Mother , " Joseph said , backing toward the train door ; he took a swift look up and down the platform , and then reached up to his mother and gave her a rapid kiss on the cheek . " Take care of yourself , " he said . " Do n't forget to telephone the minute you get there , " his mother said . " Write me every day , and tell Grandma you 're supposed to brush your teeth every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " Joseph said . " Sure , Mother . " " So long , son , " said his father . " So long , Dad , " Joseph said ; solemnly they shook hands . " Take care of yourself , " Joseph said . " Have a good time , " his father said . As Joseph climbed up the steps to the train he could hear his mother saying , " And telephone us when you get there and be care-ful ? " " Good-by , good-by , " he said , and went into the train . He had been located by his father in a double seat at the end of the car and , once settled , he turned as a matter of duty to the window . His father , with an unmanly took of concern , waved to him and nodded violently , as though to indicate that everything was going to be all right , that they had pulled it off beautifully , but his mother , twisting her fingers nervously , came close to the window of the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but probably clearly audible to everyone for miles without , gave him at what appeared to be some length an account of how she had changed her mind and was probably going to come with him after all . Joseph nodded and smiled and waved and shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he could not hear , but his mother went on talking , now and then glancing nervously at the front of the train , as though afraid that the engine might start and take Joseph away before she had made herself absolutely sure that he was going to be all right . Joseph , who felt with some justice that in the past few days his mother had told him every conceivable pertinent fact about his traveling alone tohis grandfather 's and her worries about same , was able to make out such statements as , " Be careful , " and , " Telephone us the minute you get there , " and , " Do n't forget to write . " Then the train stirred , and hesitated , and moved slightly again , and Joseph backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He - was positive that what his mother was saying as the train pulled out was , " Are you sure you 'll be all right ? " She blew a kiss to him as the train started , and he ducked . s tTRVEYING his prospects as the train took him slowly away from his mother and father , he was pleased . The journey should take only a little over three hours , and he knew the name of the station and had his ticket safely in his jacket pocket ; although he had been reluctant to yield in any fashion to his mother 's misgivings , he had checked several times , secretly , to make sure the ticket was safe . He had half a dozen comic books  --  a luxury he was not ordinarily allowed  --  and a chocolate bar ; he had his suitcase and his cap , and he had seen personalty to the packing of his first baseman 's mitt . He had a dollar bill in the pocket of his pants , because his mother thought he should have some money in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train wreck ( although his Father had pointed out that in the case of a major disaster the victims were not expected to pay their own expenses , at least not before their families had been notified ) or perhaps in the case of some vital expense to which his grandfather 's income would not be adequate . His father had thought that Joe ought to have a little money by him in case he wanted to buy anything , and because a man ought not to travel unless he had money in his pocket . " Might pick up a girl on the train and want to buy her lunch , " his father had said jovially and his mother , regarding her husband thoughtfully , had remarked , " Let 's hope Joseph does n't do things like that , " and Joe and his father had winked at one another . So , regarding his comic books and his suitcase and his ticket and his chocolate bar , and feeling the imperceptible but emphatic presence of the dollar bill in his-pocket , Joe leaned back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses now moving steadily past , and said to himself , " This is the life , boy . " 77 Before indulging in the several glories of comic books and chocolate bar he spent a moment or so watching the houses of his home town disappear beyond the train ; ahead of him , at his grandfather 's farm , lay a summer of cows and horses and probable wrestling matches in the grass ; behind him lay school and its infinite irritations , and his mother and father . He wondered briefly if his mother were still looking after the train and telling him to write , and then largely he forgot her . With a sigh of pure pleasure he leaned back and selected a comic book , one which dealt with the completely realistic adventures of a powerful magician among hostile African tribes . This is the life , boy , he told himself again , and glanced again out the window to see a boy about his own age sitting on a fence watching the train go by . For a minute Joseph thought of waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his dignity as a traveler ; moreover , the boy on the fence was wearing a dirty sweatshirt which made Joe move uneasily under his stiff collar and suit jacket , and he thought longingly of the comfortable old shirt with the insignia " Brooklyn Dodgers " which was in his suitcase . Then , just as the traitorous idea of changing on the train occurred to him , and of arriving at his grandfather 's not in his good suit became a possibility , all sensible thought was driven from his mind by a cruel and unnecessary blow . Someone sat down next to him , breathing heavily , and from the quick flash of perfume and the movement of cloth which could only be a dress rustling Joe realized with a strong sense of injustice that his paradise had been invaded by some woman . is this seat taken ? " she asked . Joe refused to recognize her existence by turning his head to look at her , but he told her sullenly , " No , it 's not . " Not taken , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? Are n't there enough old seats in the train she could go and sit in without taking mine ? H E SEEMED to lose himself in contemplation of the scenery beyond the train window , but secretly he was wishing direly that the woman would suddenly discover she had forgotten her suitcase or find out she had no ticket or remember that she had left the bathtub running at home  --  anything , to get her off the train at the first station , and out of Joe 's way . " You going far ? " Talking , too , Joe thought , she has to take my seat and then she goes and talks my ear off , darn old pest . " Yeah , " he said . " Merry-town . " " What 's your name ? " Joe , from long experience , could have answered all her questions in one sentence , he was so familiar with the series  --  I 'm nine years old , he could have told her , and I 'm in the fifth grade , and , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what I learn in school it 's nothing because I do n't like school and I do like movies , and I 'm going to my grandfather 's house , and more than anything else I hate women who come and sit beside me and ask me silly questions and if my mother did n't keep after me all the time about my manners I would probably gather my things together and move to another seat and if you do n't stop asking me -- What 's your name , little boy ? " Little boy , Joe told himself bitterly , on top of everything else , little boy . " Joe , " he said . " How old are you ? " He lifted his eyes wearily and regarded the conductor entering the car ; it was surely too much to hope that this female plague had forgotten her ticket , but could it be remotely possible that she was on the wrong train ? " Cot your ticket , Joe ? " the woman asked . " Sure , " said Joe . " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor , since her voice was not at this moment the voice women use in addressing a little boy , but the voice which goes with speaking to conductors and taxi drivers and sales clerks , " I 'm afraid I have n't got a ticket . I had no time to get one . " " Where you going ? " said the conductor . Would they put her off the train ? For the first time , Joe turned and looked at her , eagerly and with hope . Would they possibly , hopefully , desperately , put her off the train ? " I 'm going to Merrytown , " she said , and Joe 's convictions about the generally weak-minded attitudes of the adult world were all confirmed ; the conductor tore a slip from a pad he carried , punched a hole in it , and told the woman , " Two seventy-three . " While she was'searching her pocketbook for her money  --  if she knew she was going to have to buy a ticket , Joe thought disgustedly , why n't she have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned at him . " Your boy got his ticket all right , " he pointed out . The woman smiled . " He got to the station ahead of me , " she said . The conductor gave her her change , and went on down the car . " That was funny , when he thought you were my little boy , " the woman said . " Yeah , " said Joe . " What 're you reading ? " Wearily , Joe put his comic book down . " Comic , " he said . " Interesting ? " " Yeah , " said Joe . " Say , look at the policeman , " the woman said . Joe looked where she was pointing and saw  --  he would not have believed this , since he knew perfectly well that most women can not tell the difference between a policeman and a mailman  --  that it was undeniably a policeman , and that he was regarding the occupants of the car very much as though there might be a murderer or an international jewel thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveying the car for a moment , he came a few steps forward to the last seat , where Joe and the woman were sitting . " Name ? " he said sternly to the woman . " Mrs. John Aldridge , officer , " said the woman promptly . " And this is my little boy Joseph . " " Hi , Joe , " said the policeman . Joe , speechless , stared at the policeman and nodded dumbly . " Where 'd you get on ? " the policeman asked the woman . " Ashville , " she said . " See anything of a woman about your height and build , wearing a fur jacket , getting on the train at Ashville ? " do n't think so , " said the woman . " Why ? " " Wanted , " said the policeman tersely . " Keep your eyes open , " he told Joe . " Might get a reward . " He passed on down the car , and stopped occasionally to speak to women who seemed to be alone . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and Joe turned and took a deep look at the woman sitting beside him . " What 'd you do ? " he asked . " Stole some money , " said the woman , and grinned . Joe grinned back . If he had been sorely pressed , he might in all his experience until now have been able to identify only his mother as a woman both pretty and lovable ; in this case , however  --  and perhaps it was enhanced by a sort of outlaw glory  --  he found the woman sitting next to him much more attractive than he had before supposed . She looked nice , she had soft hair , she had a pleasant smile and not a lot of lipstick and stuff on , and her fur jacket was rich and soft against Joe 's hand . Moreover , Joe knew absolutely when she grinned at him that there were not going to be any more questions about nonsense like people 's ages and whether they liked school , and he found himself grinning back at her in quite a friendly manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sure , " said the woman . " Pretty soon now . But it was worth it . " " Why ? " Joe asked ; crime , he well knew , did not pay . " See , " said the woman , " I wanted to spend about two weeks having a good time there in Ashville . I wanted this coat , see ? And I wanted just to buy a lot of clothes and things . " " So ? " said Joe . " So I took the money from the old tightwad I worked for and I went off to Ashville and bought some clothes and went to a lot of movies and things and had a fine time . " " Sort of a vacation , " Joe said . " Sure , " the woman said . " Knew all the time they 'd catch me , of course . For one thing , I always knew I had to come home again . But it was worth itl " " How much ? " said Joe . " Two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Joe . They settled back comfortably . Joe , without more than a moment 's pause to think , offered the woman his comic book about the African head-hunters , and when the policeman came back through the car , eyeing them sharply , they were leaning back shoulder to shoulder , the woman apparently deep in African adventure , Joe engrossed in the adventures of a flying newspaper reporter who solved vicious gang murders . " How is your book , Ma ? " Joe said loudly as the policeman passed , and the woman laughed and said , " Fine , fine . " As the door closed behind the policeman the woman said softly , " You know , I like to see how long I can keep out of their way . " " Ca n't keep it up forever , " Joe pointed out . " No , " said the woman , " but I 'd like to go back by myself and just give them what 's left of the money . I had my good time . " " Seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the first time you did anything like this they probably would n't punish you so much . " " I 'm not ever going to do it again , " the woman said . " I mean , you sort of build up all your life for one real good time like this , and then you can take your punishment and not mind it so much . " " I do n't know , " Joe said reluctantly , various small sins of his own with regard to matches and his father 's cigars and other people 's lunch boxes crossing his mind ; " seems to me that even if you do think now that you 'll never do it again , sometimes  --  well , sometimes , you do it anyway . " He thought . " I always say I 'll never do it again , though . " " Well , if you do it again , " the woman pointed out , " you get punished twice as bad the next time . " Joe grinned . " I took a dime out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'll never do that again . " " Same thing I did , " said the woman . Joe shook his head . " If the policemen plan to spank you the way my father spanked me . . . , " he said . T HEY were companionably silent for a while , and then the woman said , " Say , Joe , you hungry ? Let 's go into the dining car . " " I 'm supposed to stay here , " Joe said . " But I ca n't go without you , " the woman said . " They think I 'm all right because the woman they want would n't be traveling with her little boy . " " Stop calling me your little boy , " Joe said . " Why ? " " Call me your son or something , " Joe said . " No more little boy stuff . " " Right , " said the woman . " Anyway , I 'm sure your mother would n't mind if you went into the dining car with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he got up and followed the woman out of the car and down through the next car ; people glanced up at them as they passed and then away again , and Joe thought triumphantly that they would sure stare harder if they knew that this innocent-looking woman and her son were outsmarting the cops every step they took . They found a table in the dining car , and sat down . The woman took up the menu and said , " What 'll you have , Joe ? " Blissfully , Joe regarded the woman , the waiters moving quickly back and forth , the shining silverware , the white tablecloth and napkins . " Hard to say right off , " he said . " Hamburger ? " said the woman . " Spaghetti ? Or would you rather just have two or three desserts ? " Joe stared . " You mean , like , just blue-berry pie with ice cream and a hot fudge sundae ? " he asked . " Like that ? " " Sure , " said the woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I took that dime out of my mother 's pocketbook , " Joe told her , " I spent a nickel on gum and a nickel on candy . " " Tell me , " said the woman , leaning forward earnestly , " the candy and gum  --  was it all right ? I mean , the same as usual ? " Joe shook his head . " I was so afraid someone would see me , " he said , " I ate all the candy in two mouthfuls standing on the street and I was scared to open the gum at all . " The woman nodded . " That 's why I 'm going back so soon , I guess , " she said , and sighed . " Well , " said Joe practically , " might as well have blueberry pie first , anyway . " They ate their lunch peacefully , discussing baseball and television and what Joe wanted to be when he grew up ; once the policeman passed through the car and nodded to them cheerfully , and the waiter opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his lunch with a piece of watermelon . When they had finished and the woman had paid the check , they found that they were due in Merrytown in fifteen minutes , and they hurried back to their seat to gather together Joe 's comic books and suitcase . " Thank you very much for the nice lunch , " Joe said to the woman as they sat down again , and congratulated himself upon remembering to say it . " Nothing at all , " the woman said . " Are n't you my little boy ? " " Watch that little boy stuff , " Joe said warningly , and she said , " I mean , are n't you my son ? " The porter who had been delegated to keep an eye on Joe opened the car door and put his head in . He smiled reassuringly at Joe and said , " Five minutes to your station , boy . " " Thanks , " said Joe . He turned to the woman . " Maybe , " he said urgently , " if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do at all , " said the woman . " I really had a fine time . " " I guess so , " Joe said . " But you wo n't do it again . " " Well , I knew when I started I 'd be pun-ished sooner or later , " the woman said . " Yeah , " Joe said . " Ca n't get out of it now . " The train pulled slowly to- a stop and Joe leaned toward the window to see if his grandfather were waiting . " We better not get off together , " the woman said ; " might worry your grandpa to see you with a stranger . " " Guess so , " said Joe . He stood up , and took hold of his suitcase . " Good-by , then , " he said reluctantly . " Good-by , Joe , " said the woman . " Thanks . " 66 r IGHT , " said Joe , and as the train stopped he opened the door and went out onto the steps . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe turned to see his grandfather coming down the platform . " Hello , fellow , " said his grandfather . " So you made it . " " Sure , " said Joe . " No trick at all . " " Never thought you would n't , " said his grandfather . " Your mother wants you to ? " " Telephone as soon as I get here , " Joc said . " I know . " " Come along , then , " his grandfather said . " Grandma 's waiting at home . " He led Joe to the parking lot and helped him and his suitcase into the car . As his grandfather got into the front seat beside him Joe turned and looked back at the train and saw the woman walking down the platform with the policeman holding her arm . Joe leaned out of the car and waved violently . " So long , " he called . " So long , Joe , " the woman called back , waving . " It 's a shame the cops had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His grandfather laughed . " You read too many comic hooks , fellow , " he said . " Everyone with a policeman is n't being arrested  --  he 's probably her brother or something . " " Yeah , " said Joe . " Have a good trip ? " his grandfather asked . " Anything happen ? " Joe thought . " Saw a boy sitting on a fence , " he said . " I did n't wave to him , though . " The Corning Class War  --  Old vs .
