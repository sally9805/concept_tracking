txt The U.S. was in a difficult position on the question of a summit conference on Berlin . and it probably took the realistic way out ? by agreeing to participate in such a meeting of heads of government this summer even if a foreign ministers ' session this spring accomplishes little . It is axiomatic that the U.S. should not bow to pressure from either friend or foe on matters of basic principle . But the question of a summit conference is not really one of fundamental policy , no matter how many reservations there may be about it . Actually some of the reservations apply to any form of attempted negotiation with the Soviets . President De Gaulle is said to question the whole thesis that the West should seek talks with the Soviets , and there is a point in that view . Why should it be assumed that disaster will ensue if no negotiations are held ? Why should it be assumed the Soviets will agree to anything the West can accept if negotiations are held ? The Soviets ' purpose . after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining table if they possibly can . The issue , though , boils down largely to one of practicality . For various reasons it has become increasingly clear that a summit meeting was all but inevitable . In that situation , if the U.S. held out or insisted on too many conditions , however sensible , it would seem to be quibbling on a matter which many people fear holds the danger of war . If the U.S. has bowed to pressure in this case , it is not so much that of IMrushchev or Macmillan as of the sOorld 's longing for peace . Practicality , at any rate , must govern the approach to the summit . We should not assume there will be any agreement . Even more important , we should not feel that getting an agreement is the overriding consideration . As the background of Berlin itself shows , a bad agreement with the Soviets can be far worse than no agreement at all .
