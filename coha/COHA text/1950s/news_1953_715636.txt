txt The question of what constitutes happiness for a hen is becoming a maior public issue in Britain . The cause of the controversy is the assembly line organization of hens known as the battery system brought to Britain from , the ' United States . With the approval of the ministry of agriculture , it has been greatly ex- , panded here to combat the postwar egg shortage . Whether or not it is responsible , eggs came off ration this spring and have been available in quantity ever , since . The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals condemns the battery because it is " unnatural " and therefore " conducive to unhappiness among hens . " The society said today it will seek introduction of a bill to outlaw the practice at the next session of parliament . Just Eat and Lay Eggs Animal happiness is even more a public preoccupation here than in the United States , and arguments about the " hen battery " have filled the ' news , editorial and letter columns of the press in recent days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot square cages each housing a hen and floored with wire mesh for cleanliness . The hen has no room to fly ' about or indulge in other distractions like scratching-or pecking at other hens . ? She just sits and eats and lays eggs-30 to 40 more a year than her unregimented sister . Artificial daylight is used to keep her busy 18 hours out of 24 . Winds up as a Roast When she falls below the economic output level " or when " her overstimulated organs give out , " the critics of the system say she makes a tender roasting fowl . The R. S. P. C. A. has charged that the system makes the hen " a mere egg laying machine . " A society spokesman announced a campaign to convince farmers that the " deep litter " system where hens nest in straw in larger cages is a better economic proposition .

Their legs have atrophied . " Her Crowning Glory The National Union of ' Farmers has undertaken a counter campaign . The hen likes being an egg laying machine , said a union spokesman . " It 's her crowning glory , " he said , " and if she were n't happy the system would n't work at all , because only contented hens lay regularly . " " Moreover , " he continued , " battery hens are better off than barnyard or deep litter hens . They 're free from pests and disease and drafts and they get clean food and water . Their ' lives are no more unnatural than the lives of a man and his dog in a London flat . " There 's no prospect of ascertaining the hen 's views , but the London Daily Mail called in a front page editorial for " a thoro ana authoritative inquiry into the whole matter .
