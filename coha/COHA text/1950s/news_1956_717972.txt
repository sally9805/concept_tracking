txt Letters to The Times CHARLES WESLEY LOWRY.CHARLES C. BRADLEY.ROY WILKINS , pg . 176 Letters to The Times The writer of the following letter , an Episcopal theologian and author , now is chairman and executive director of the nonsectarian Foundation for Religious Action in the Social and Civil Order . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TINIER : I have just read your editorial " Khrushchev on Stalin " in your issue of June 5 . May I especially compliment you upon the insight and strength of your key sentences : " The essence of the matter is that the real defendant before the bar of history is not Stalin or the Stalinist group . The real defendant , the real culprit , is the Communist ideology itself . " In these words you put your finger unerringly upon the central issue of our epoch . It is of the utmost importance that intelligent citizens of the free world everywhere see this and hold fast to it at the present dangerous moment when the successors of Stalin are attempting to use his degradation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new heights of glory and promise for the future . It was the greatest of all Russians , Feodor Dostoievsky , who said : " To be a genuine Russian means to become the blood brother of all human beings . " Betrayal of Multitude This beautiful declaration points to the great betrayal of our time , the betrayal of the Russian people and of the hopes and dreams of the hungry and thirsty multitudes of the twentieth century . It is a betrayal which can not be foisted on the demigod whose body rests in state beside that of Lenin but whose ghost will not so easily be confined to a solitary perdition . In some sense this massive and shattering betrayal of man goes back more than a hundred years to the thoughts . and acts of will of the premier architects of totalitarianism , Marx and Engels . These apostles of universal revolutionary violence dismissed religion as " the opium of the people , " asserted that the Judaeo-Christian ethic of justice , mercy and love was a rationalization of outmoded property relationships and branded the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In a nearly absolute sense the great betrayal lies at the door of Lenin , the first and foremost exemplar of twentieth-century totalitarianism in theory and practice . At an early stage of the bloody and chaotic period which followed the " October Revolution " of 1917 colleagues took Lenin to task for spilling so much Russian blood . With perfect consistency this emancipated son of the great Mother Russia replied : " It is n't a question of Russia at all , gentlemen . I spit on Russia , * * * This is merely one phase through which we pass on the way to a world revolution . " Responsibility of West In a real sense , also , the betrayal of which we speak and the agony of man in our period are realities in which we of the West have a responsibility . I well remember encountering more than two decades ago Albert Schweitzer 's account in his autobiography of his realization well before the end of the nineteenth century that something had happened to the moral and spiritual foundations of civilization . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . by the totalitarian political religions . A Lenin , a Hitler , a Stalin , a Perdn became possible . The hollow and deceitful lament of a Khrushchev became possible . Still more ominous ? it became possible that such a gesture might take in a large part of a globally unified and interrelated world . This is a real and present danger ? it is by no means imaginary . For such a situation no people is without blame , and no educated , knowledgeable person is without responsibility , But this also means that there is a way out . There is a solution . This solution is a quickening of conscience on a world scale ; it is a new universal realization that knowledge and science are not enough and can never by themselves create a great civilization . Civilization requires at its heart a profound sense that the ethical perfecting of the individual and society matters . America at her best believes this and would confess this as her democratic faith . The hope of a better world lies in a more sincere practice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it by word and deed before other nations and peoples . Message of Trust May it not be , also , that the time is now ripe for conveying to the Russian people over the heads of the Kremlin oligarchy this message hand our . trust that the country I which could produce a Dostoievsky and a Tolstoy has a unique and Idecisive contribution to make to a new and finer age ? There are not a few signs that the people of the Soviet Union are mentally and spiritually very hungry . This hunger and the realization still more poignantly of the monstrous baseness and evil of the Communist system , as a result of the Khrushchev accusation and confession , present a priceless opportunity if w have the wit , the imagination and the humanity to offer this long-suffering people bread and not a stone . This " bread , " I suggest , is the aid and encouragement that our Government and private organize. ? , tions should give to the Russia* people ( Great Russians as well as others ) to seek freedom and selfgovernment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebirth of man under God and the renewal in a global setting of humane civilization . CHARLES WESLEY LOWRY . Washington , June 5 , 1956 . Dinosaur Dams Opposed Congress Asked to Convert Area Into a National Park The writer of the following letter is Associate Professor of Geology at Montana State College . ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a recent news item you point to more heat being generated over Dinosaur National Monument . While Senator Watkins charges the conservationists with bad faith , other Senators introduced bills to make the area a full-fledged national park . I am not certain why the conservationists are being accused of bad faith . But if the conservationists are nervous about the good in. tentions of the Bureau of Reclamation , it is not without reason . The conservationists as a group acted in good faith when they withdrew opposition to the Upper Colorado River Project , upon removal of Echo Park Dam from the project , even though many individual conservationists had well-founded misgivings about the soundness of the whole scheme . With the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with Echo Park Dam , we must question the good faith of the bureau and its apologists . One ca n't help ask if this is the sort of integrity we can expect from a Government agency . Or is this just the Bureau of Rec ? lamation once more acting like the Bureau of Reclamation ? It would clear the air a lot if Congress would speedily convert Dinosaur National Monument to a national park as an act of good faith and firm intention to maintain both the integrity of this area and the integrity of the Bureau of Reclamation . Also , I think the time is over-ripe to set up a Resource Policy and Control Board , completely separate from such action agencies of the Government as the Bureau of Reclamation . The board 's job would be to review the economics , geology , competing uses and over-all general advisability of these large and expensive Government projects . The poor old taxpayer who has little choice but to foot the bill has a right to some assuranc6 that these fantastic expenditures are something more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of a particular Government bureau . CHARLES C. BRADLEY , Bozeman , Mont. , May 24 , 1956 . Ban on N. A. A. C. E. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of June 3 " Ala ? bama vs 1956 " succinctly and pertinently sums up the situation in that state and in Louisiana , where a similar ban is in effect against the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . The opponents of desegregation are indeed engaged in a futile war against time as well as against science , economics and morality . They will not be able to halt permanently the march of time no matter how desperately they try . Complying with ' the state court injunctions in Alabama and Louisiana , the N. A. A. C. P. has suspended operations in those states , but has by no means given up the fight . - The legal maneuvers required to get the question through hostile state courts and , failing there , to a . Federal adjudication , will be long and tortuous . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed , a fact which should be of concern even to those not moved particularly by the plight of the Negro or of the N. A. A. C. P. The N. A. A. C. P. is gratified to have the support of The New York Times in this fight for freedom of protest . ROY WILKINS , Executive Secretary , National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
