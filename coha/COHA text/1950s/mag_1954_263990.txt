COMSTOCK COMMOTION : THE STORY OF THE TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE ( 129 pp. ) - Lucius Beebe - Stanford University Press ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Tombstone and Last Chance Gulch were sinful frontier towns , but Virginia City had nothing to be ashamed of-she could hold up her head with the worst . She had been christened with a bottle of whisky , and her intemperate citizens used to ventilate each other with six-shooters until the drafts became unbearable . At Virginia City , on Nevada 's silver-veined Comstock Lode , local mishaps and bonanzas were recorded by the Territorial Enterprise , as freewheeling and free-shooting a weekly as the U.S. has known . <P> In Comstock Commotion , Author Lucius Beebe tells the story of the Territorial Enterprise , which tells the story of the Comstock . Once an Improper Bostonian , Beebe has long been fascinated with the West . In 1951 he settled down in Virginia City , and soon became publisher of the Territorial Enterprise and a full-time Westerner . Now he writes of his new home town with the same purple pen he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune : " The saloons of Virginia City , " he rhapsodizes , " then and now the drinkingest community in all the wide , wonderful , boozy world-what profligate enchantments were not latent in the mere roll call of their names , perfumed with intimate association and Old Noble Treble Crown Whiskey ! There were Pat Lynch 's Place , The Old Magnolia , The Smokery . Gentry &; Crittenden 's , and the Howling Wilderness , a premises which never at any hour of the 24 betrayed the promise of commotional doings implicit in its name . . . <P> <P> Yes , We Have No Bonanzas . The Territorial Enterprise was launched at Mormon Station in 1858 , later settled in Virginia City , where more than 100 saloons and an annual per capita consumption of 22 gallons of " strong waters , " one-third whisky , made it a newspaperman 's paradise . The Enterprise 's first big story was the war between Nevada 's settlers and the Piute Indians . Coverage of shootings , stabbings and embezzlements were always homey . Sample news story : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the residence of Henry Potter , South H Street ... It passed through a north window of the kitchen , showering bits of glass upon a paper which Mr. Potter was reading and into the hair of a child he was holding on his lap , then struck an iron pot standing on the stove at which Mrs. Potter was cooking , when it fell flattened into a pan in which a beefsteak was being cooked . . . Where the bullet came from was a mystery , and the Potter family hope that no one is angry at them . " <P> When Nevada became the Union 's 36th state , the bonanzas petered out and Virginia City became a ghost town . Its weekly 's noblest achievement probably came at news of the Union victory over the South . For three days the Enterprise published nothing , not even the victory news . Writes Author Beebe : " Its staff , from owner to the least apprentice , was dissolved in a universal sea of whisky ... "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
