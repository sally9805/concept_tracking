SHOWER OF ASHES A Story by ROBIN WHITE Drawings by Frederick E. Banbery A S CHAIRMAN of the mission council in South India , my father often found it incumbent upon him to visit people with whom he had little or nothing in common . For the most part these visits involved only minor difficulties : Father was easy to get along with . Rotund , balding , energetic , he possessed both ready wit and sense of humor . Papa Butler , people called him affectionately , and I think he enjoyed it . Or , if he did not , at least he never let on . In fact he was usually such a good sport about things that it always came as a surprise and pleasure to me when I saw him up against that rare individual capable of exasperating him . John Travers was such a man . I suppose none of us really knew Travers well . Something about him discouraged intimacies . But we respected and , in an odd sort of way , liked him . Everyone did . He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong voice , incisive answers to knotty theological problems . He came from good New England stock ; he had distinguished himself at Yale . It was said that he had given up brilliantopportunities in order to enter the mission field , a claim he never voiced . Nor was he the first to admit that he had an exalted opinion of himself . He did n't have to . It showed all over his face . His wife , Mary , struck me as simply a comfortable person to have around . She was gentle , yielding , pretty  --  one of those sweet things you never can seem to remember distinctly . Her religious beliefs were uncomplicated . They consisted of " surrendering to Christ " ? which in a practical sense seemed to me to emerge as surrendering to anything and everything her husband wanted or said was right and good . But because  --  perhaps in spite- of her they made a successful couple . After spending a year in the hills learning to speak Tamil badly , they had insisted upon and were accordingly assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time in the past Christian soldiers had attempted , with a remarkable lack of success , to storm the ramparts of Hinduism . It was assumed that the Traverses would persist until they learned the error of their choice  --  or , more precisely , the wisdom of Father 's advice ? then give it up for a teaching post in Madurai . Much to Father 's amazement , they had not only persisted , they had survived . So , while custom required him to visit all outposts at least once a year , in the Traverses ' case he paid his respects every six mouths , largely , l believe , in hopes of detecting some signs of defeat . His hopes had 70 SHOWER OF ASHES not , as yet , been rewarded ; but then , Father was always a hopeful man . Usually our visits to Siraikottai fell in October and April , those being the months when travel over torturous back roads is least painful . But for some reason our April visit that year did not take place , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainiest southwest monsoon I had ever seen  --  that we at last made the trip . Of course by then none of us was wildly ecstatic about going to see the Traverses . Mother , who managed the mission press , had a fight on her hands with the budget committee . My older sister , Dianne , had been hibernating in her room for a week because of this fungus that made her face look puffed and raw . And my younger sister , Judy , had accepted an invitation to spend two weeks at the Cape with some Standard Oil people . As for me , I did n't want to go anywhere , period . For no good reason . I just did n't feel like it . But Father was adamant . There was no point to these visits , he told us , unless we went as a family . And it was high time we saw the Traverses again . Although he did n't say so , I knew from the way he refused to elaborate on the subject that he was troubled by things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all feeling apprehensive . It was a feeling that somehow the long drive south from the city , riding out of the night into dawn over rutted dirt roads , seemed to intensify rather than dispel . I told myself that no great good could come of this trip ; and when , around midday , we arrived at Siraikottai to find the Traverses ' bungalow closed and strangely quiet , I was convinced of it . F ATHER drew our ancient Chevy station wagon up by the front veranda and turned the motor off . For a moment we all sat in suspicious silence , looking out at the shuttered doors and windows . Isolated , sprawling , built like a wealthy Hindu village home , the Traverses ' bungalow was a single-story structure surrounded by verandas of packed clay that had been washed down with dung solution . The roof was of thick gray thatch supported by rough palmyra poles ; the walls of mud , well whitewashed . Dung patties dried for fuel along the sunlit edge of the front veranda . A design , incorporating the Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the steps . Except for the design and the dung patties , which were fresh , the place looked unoccupied . " You wrote them we were coming , did n't you , Harris ? " Mother asked , knitting . " Certainly 1 wrote them , " Father whispered out of the corner of his mouth . When he drove , he liked to cover his bald head with a red kerchief , knotted at the corners . He removed the kerchief and mopped his face with it . " Then where is everyone ? " I asked . " Out , probably , " Dianne said . She was hunched up next to me on the back seat , sponging her face with cotton soaked in a solution of boric acid and baking soda which she carried in an old Eno 's bottle . " Maybe something 's wrong , " said Judy , sitting on the other side of me , her hare feet propped on the back of Father 's seat . The clicking of Mother 's knitting needles ceased . Calmly she leaned across Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffectual . I had the eerie feeling we were being watched . Father opened the door and placed a foot on the driveway . " Let 's go have a look , Matt , " he said to me . Judy goosed me as I climbed out over her legs . " Watch that stuff , " I said , and let my sandal scrape her shin . " Well . get your filthy feet off me , " she said . " Maybe we 'd all better get out , Harris , " Mother said . " It 's too hot in here . " Which was the truth . Heat rose from everything like a vast swarm of flies . " I 'm not restraining you , Emily , " Father said . Together he and I went to the veranda and ducked under the low edge of the thatch roof . The slap-slap of my sandals made a ringing sound along the thick mud walls . Behind us car doors opened and closed in rapid succession . Father stepped gingerly around the clung patties . " Matt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fecal discs , please ? " " Fecal discs ? " I said . " Oh , you mean bull sh " - sh- shingles . " He did not look amused . Unwillingly I began scuffing a path through Travers ' Siegfried Line . " Travers ! " Father called . He knocked on the front door , then rattled the shutters of the window on the right . " John ? Mary ? " There was some sort of smell lingering about the veranda  --  I mean over and above that of cow manure . This was odd , musty  --  an odor that made me think of rats . " Pee-u ! " Judy said , corning into the shade . " Do n't they ever clean anything around here ? What 's that awful stench ? " " Have a hint , " I said , and flipped a moist dung patty in her direction , " of mint . " " Nasty ! " Judy said , dodging . " Nasty thing , you ! " " Hoo-hool " Mother called as she climbed to the veranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by Dianne whose face was rapidly acquiring a pasty texture in the heat . " The door 's locked , " Father said . " That 's odd , " Mother said . " I thought they did n't believe in locks  --  among other things . " " Well , this front room 's locked , " Father said . We moved slowly down the veranda , trying all the windows . Judy pranced ahead of us , full of purpose , and disappeared onto the side veranda . " Hey ! " she called suddenly . " Hey ! Come here , quick ! " We hurried after her , compelled by a maximum-disaster note of alarm in her voice . " What 's the matter ? " Father asked . " In there , " Judy said breathlessly . She had her hands cupped to her eyes and was trying to peer into the front room through a crack in the rough shutter boards . " I think someone 's in there . " " You 're imagining things , " Dianne said , trying to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Judy said . " I heard a noise . " " Probably just a bat , dear , " Mother said . " I say , Travers ! " Father called , " is that you ? " We all began looking for cracks in the shutters . I found one in the next window . But it was so dark inside that for a moment I could see nothing . Then through the gloom I made out , just faintly , something that looked like a mummy propped in the far corner . The room had the bareness of a cage . I felt my skin pucker . A strong , musty , rat odor emanated from the crack . " There is someone in there , " Dianne said excitedly . " It 's a woman . I can see her , " " Nuts , " I said . " How can you tell ? It 's so dark it could be a bedroll . " " Or Mrs. Travers , " Judy said . Father jerked away from the shutter and stared at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . H E DID not reply but turned and hurried down the veranda to the side door . He tried the latch . With a creak of rusty hinges , the door swung open . I left the window and followed him into what I remembered was Travers ' study . A bat detached itself from the ceiling and swooped about . I ducked and waved my arms . The bat fluttered out the door . I heard Father fumble in his pocket . He brought his hand out and struck a match . In the sudden yellow flare I saw the mat on thefloor with the cushion on it , the low board desk , the shelf of books , the simple wooden Cross on the wall . The door that led to the front room on the left was closed . A sturdy padlock glinted from the hasp . The match trembled in Father 's hand and went out . Mother appeared in the door with the girls . " Anyone here ? " she asked . " Just us ghosts , " 1 said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , " would you mind giving me a hand letting in some light ? " We moved in a group through the bungalow , banging open shutters and doors . Except for the front room , all approaches to which had been sealed off , the place was unlocked . Even so the house , its smell and bareness , oppressed me . It always had  --  partly , I guess , because of the way the Traverses lived . They not only tried to be like Indians in every respect , at times they even seemed to think like them . And in a way I sensed an implied threat to it all , as if the Traverses had succeeded in drawing a line between East and " West and had rejected us for the other side . I felt obliged to take a deep breath every time I opened a window . " How do they stand living like this ? " Judy asked . " Search me , " Dianne said . " But with nothing ! " Judy said . " Not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They may be about . " As we opened the back door and entered the rear courtyard , I heard a chicken squawk . Across the way the cook , a shriveled , evil-looking man , was squatting on the kitchen veranda leisurely sawing the head off a chicken with a short knife . There was a spurt of blood . The chicken stopped flapping and jerking about . The cook folded its head back and directed the fountain of blood away from him . He let the chicken go after a moment . It hopped violently around the yard , showering earth and shrubbery in a wide circle before it finally flopped over , kicked , and lay in a quivering heap on its side . The cook stood up and wiped his knife on a dirty cloth over his shoulder . He salaamed . " Where is Travers ? " Father asked in Tamil . His voice trembled . With a motion of his hands , as if he were lifting us up and putting us down in the right place , the cook indicated that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  faintly amused , thought  --  as we crossed the courtyard in self-conscious , almost awkward silence to the gate 72 SHOWER OF ASHES that opened through the rear wall . A little Indian boy , dressed only in a shirt , emerged from the kitchen and followed us . It was a large , square garden . crowded with papaya and banana trees , an abundant variety of vegetables , and gourd vines growing on a bamboo trellis . The servants ' quarters lay beyond the garden , separated from it by a well . A young Indian woman stood by the well . Although she was partially screened by banana leaves , I could see she was washing her sari . - A delightful , languid atmosphere pervaded the garden . The air smelled of moist , turned earth . Sunlight was filtered into green haze by dense foliage . The sound of water dripping in the well and the rhythmic thwack-thwack of wet cloth striking a wash stone made me feel drowsy . T HEN I saw Travers . Dressed only in his dhoti , he squatted off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wicker basket . His massive , bony chest was deeply bronzed . He looked up as the gate swung shut behind us . On past occasions , the sight of Travers in his dhoti always amused me . His large , angular , stiff-jointed frame did not look right in Indian clothes . But now there was one simple difference that seemed to change the whole thing , give it the threatening quality of rightness : as Travers looked up , I saw a small white Cross glisten in the center of his broad forehead like a caste mark . He got to his feet . Father took a step toward him . For a moment they stared at each other . Travers salaamed . He looked confused . " Reverend Butler , " he said , bowing slightly . Father nodded grimly . ' Good to see you , John , " he said . - Is it really ? " Travers said . " Of course , " Father said . " What are you doing out here ? " " Picking lunch , " Travers said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw Father 's hands open and close . " I wonder who that woman is ? " Judy whispered to Dianne . " What woman ? " Dianne said . " The one by the well , of course , " Judy said . " Probably the cook 's wife , " I said . " Want to bet ? " Judy said . I heard Mother ask , " Who 's the young woman over there , John ? " " That is Rani , " Travers replied , " one of our unmarried mothers . " " Unmarried mothers ? " Father said . " What did I tell you ? " Judy whispered . " Since you were last here , " Travers explained , " we 've turned the servants ' quarters into a home for wayward women . Mary thought it a shame to let the building remain unused simply because we do n't believe in employing art army of servants . " Father remarked that he thought it would have been wiser , since it involved mission property , had Travers consulted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have n't heard from Mary in some time , " Mother said . " How is she ? " Travers seemed to hesitate as if he did not hear Mother , or as if his mind was on other things . He looked around . " Oh , she 's well , she 's well , " he said after a moment , nodding . " Where is she ? " Mother asked . " In the villages , " he said , " with her Bible - Women . I do n't expect her back for a few weeks . " He picked up his basket and , balancing it on his head , started up the path toward the bungalow . He appeared indifferent as to whether we followed or stayed behind . " Well , " Father said , " let 's get out of the sun now . " He herded us ahead of him through the gate . " When are you going to ask him about the front room ? ' ' Judy asked . nosey . presently , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as we returned to the courtyard . Mother tried to take his hand , but he drew back solemnly and squatted beside the cook who had begun to pluck the chicken . Travers left the basket of vegetables by the kitchen door and went into the dining room . He was sitting cross-legged on the floor when we entered . He put on a pair of reading glasses and opened a dilapidated leatherbound book . " Please make yourselves comfortable , " he said , looking at us over his glasses . " The cook has poured water if you care to wash . I 've asked him to prepare chicken for you . " " That 's very thoughtful , John , " Mother said , arranging herself on a mat . F ATHER was temporarily restored to good spirits . The Traverses were vegetarians , and if there was one thing he disliked about these visits it was having to munch raw vegetables . They got under his uppers . " Yes , indeed , John , " he said . " Most thoughtful . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , " to convince everyone of the wisdom of a diet like ours . " Father pursed his lips . " Why do n't you children go out on the back veranda for a while , " Mother said . ' ' Your father and I would like to visit with Mr. Travers . " When none of us seemed inclined to budge , Travers looked up . " Are you hard of hearing , or simply disobedient ? " he said . Cowed , we slunk out onto the back veranda . " Jaysus , " I said . " Can you beat that ? Of all the . . " " I wonder who that little Indian boy is ? " Judy said . " The cook 's son , " Dianne said . " Who else ? " " Who the hell cares , " I said . " Shl " Judy said . " Listen ! " " I might as well tell you , John , " I heard Father say , " that we were disturbed to find the bungalow closed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What Harris means , " Mother said , " is that we were puzzled about the locks on the front room . The children seemed to think there 's someone in it . " ' There is , " Travers said . " You see ! " Dianne said to me . Judy held her hand up for Dianne to be quiet . " What on earth are you doing with a woman locked in the front room ? " Mother asked . " I do not see that it is any concern of yours , " Traver said . " Well , I 'm asking you , " Father said , his voice rising , " and I 'm making it my concern . " " As you wish , " Travers said . I heard his book shut with a snap . " She 's one of our crisis cases . " " Crisis cases ? " Father said . " Yes , " Travers said , and in a tired , thoughtful voice added that the woman was young , that she had been there for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent her away and taken in a flock of concubines . The experience had driven the woman out of her mind . She believed her husband to be dead ; she wished to commit suttee . His voice took on a peculiar breathless intensity . " I was able to foil her initial attempt , " he said , " and bring her to the bungalow . She 's already tried once to ignite herself with kerosene from a lamp we left with her . I do what I can , but she 's lost all hope and refuses to talk to anyone . " " Hmph , " Father said . " Unfortunate situation . " " Would n't it be better in the long run , " Mother said , " to put her up some place else ? I mean , she 's taken up your front room , and she does smell terribly . I should think you 'd want to send a deranged person like that to an institution where she could receive qualified help . " WILLIAM GIBSON LULLABY Four are the corners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep : but where Grows a weed her body of pain To rid ? Beneath our floor There is wailing in hell , and devils burn . ( Be hid , my love , be hid . ) Four are the horsemen of winds Whose nightly brawl Is upon us in chattering tooth and hoof ; But whom can I pray her soul To keep ? Beyond our roof There is war in heaven , and angels Fall . ( Sleep , my mortal , sleep . ) " You doubt my ability to handle her ? " Travers said . " No , it 's not that , John , " Mother said . " I just think it might be easier on you and Mary . It 's a terrible drain to have your home taken over like this . " " Convenience can not be a condition of virtue , " Travers said . " Listen , man , " Father said , " we 're not questioning your virtue . We 're trying to think what 's the best way to help that woman in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good keeping her in the bungalow . It must be a disruptive in-fluence . " " Perhaps it is , " Travers said . " But I wo n't force her to leave when she clearly wishes to stay . " Father puffed with annoyance . Try as he would , he could not prevail upon Travers to have the maniac moved to the city hospital . Nor was he prepared to force the issue by insisting that we take her with us . The woman , Travers pointed out , was determined to stay there until she died . She would not be an easy passenger . " Well , at least I 'd like to see her , ' ' Father said . " I 'm afraid , " Travers said , " that 's impossible . " " What do you mean impossible ? " Father said . " All you have to do is unlock the door . " " It has nothing to do with unlocking doors , " Travers said . " I wo n't have people gawking at her . " Father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who wants to gawk at her ? I 'm asking to see for myself what 's going on around here . " " This is not a circus , " Travers said . " I 'm telling you to open that door , " Father said . " It 's quite out of the question , " Travers replied . " The woman does not wish to be seen , and I shall not humiliate her by permitting you to enter against her wishes . " A F T E R lunch I was too happy to oblige when Mother asked me to get the camp cots from the car and help Judy and Dianne set them up on the side veranda . Travers retired to the front room for a session with the mad woman ; and Mother and Father went into the study to review mission accounts . 1 unloaded the bedrolls , cots , and mosquito netting from the car top and brought them onto the side veranda . Judy and Dianne helped me set them up . Then while they made the beds and tied mosquito nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazy woman moan and pad about the front room as Travers talked to her . Sometimes I sensed that she was pressed up against the shutters watching us . At other times it sounded as if she had thrown herself on the floor and writhed . I wondered what Travers was saying I could not help newed curiosity . " I wonder why Mr. Travers wo n't let Mother and Dad go in the front room ? " Judy said . " You heard what he said , " I told her . " The woman does n't want to be looked at . " " I know that 's what he said , " Judy replied . " Maybe he 's got someone in there he does n't want us to see . " " Like who ? " Dianne said . " How should I know ? " Judy said " But it is odd that Mrs. Travers is away . " Dianne stopped in the middle of tucking a sheet and looked at me with a startled expression . " That 's ridiculous , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of us moved swiftly over to the shutters and peered through cracks . " Well , it could be her , ' ' Dianne said . I stared hard at the shapeless object in the corner of the living-room . " It could be anything , ' ' I said , " and you know it . " " Matt 's right , " Dianne said . " I really ca n't see a thing . " " All I said , " Judy replied quietly , " was that it 's odd Mrs. Travers is away . " We went back to work , none of us talking . Despite my denial of it , the idea obsessed me . Perhaps I wanted to find some secret evil in Travers . Perhaps I hoped that his Indian ways were all sham , all external trappings to disguise some monstrous sin . It 's hard to say . But as I worked , I felt a growing conviction that it was indeed Mrs. Travers in that front room . And from there it was easy enough to build supporting evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he Indian ; he had taken in concubines , beaten Mrs. Travers , driven her mad , shut her up in the front room . The women in the servants ' quarters , Mrs. Travers ' strange absence in the face of our announced visit , Travers ' refusal to open the front room for Father  --  all seemed to point the finger of guilt at John Travers . As I thought it over , it gained a curious momentum of rightness , of plausibility , which frightened me . When we had finished with the cots , Mother and Father came out and lay down for a nap . They both looked drawn and upset , as if they had overheard our discussion and had reached a conclusion about the woman in the front room  --  a conclusion too horrible to face . Judy went out to a patch of grass by the side veranda to sunbathe ; Dianne sat in the shade with a pocketbook mystery and her Eno 's bottle of boric acid . I tried to rest for a while , then gave it up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been making some noise on our trip out , and so , to pass the time , I dismantled it , spread all the parts on a cloth and cleaned the brushes . The little Indian boy squatted beside me and watched . I tried not to look at him . By mid-afternoon I could feel the rains coming on . The clouds had been drifting and collecting and forming thunderheads over the ghats that lay blue on the horizon , darkening with storm . Suddenly a chill breeze rustled the thatch . The Clark piles of clouds began to drift and roll . The air became charged with a skin-tingling electric quality , and I could taste rain in it  --  a sharp taste , like the tang of old brass . There was a crash and roar of thunder , followed by a rushing sound , as of many gnats trotting over dry leaves . The little Indian boy thrust a thumb into his mouth and left me . Then it hit , the large drops falling with great fury and spatting on the dusty driveway I tossed everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain made a curious muffled sound on the thatch overhead . I sat on my cot and watched it pound the trees and earth for a while . Then , as suddenly as it had come , the rain was gone . The clouds moved . Sunlight blazed through . The earth , the veranda Boor , the walls began to steam . There was a pleasing sweetness to the smell of it . I dug into my suitcase for a towel and began drying my head . Then I went over and sat down on the edge of the veranda with Judy and Dianne . " Where is he ? " I whispered . " Who ? " Dianne said . " Travers , " I said . " Still in there , " Judy said , nodding toward the front room . " Please , " Dianne said , " let 's not talk about it . " We did n't . Travers did not come out till suppertime . W E HAD what is known as missionary-cook 's stew for supper : improperly cooked , poorly spiced rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . When we finished eating , it was dusk . With only kerosene lamps for light , we were more or less obliged to retire with the sun . Darkness brought a horde of voracious mosquitoes with it , and the only escape from them was under the netting of our cots . I climbed into bed in my underpants and lay on my back . In the dark I could hear Mother and Father whispering indistinctly . I felt alone and sleepless . I listened to the whispers until they finally drifted off into heavy breathing ; and then for a while everything was still . A cricket began trilling in smite corner of the bungalow , and under the persistent loudness and monotony of its song , I fell asleep . I slept fitfully . At times I awoke , thinking I had heard a cry , someone groan , harsh voices arguing . And once I thought I heard a strange screaming laugh . It seemed to me , as I listened to the dark for some repetition of the sound , that the bungalow was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to room , doors opening and closing . The mad woman coughed once . Suddenly the cricket stopped chirping . I sensed that someone was standing beside my bed . The mosquito net rustled . There was a dank , fetid odor of rats . A cold sweat broke out on my forehead . But nothing happened . And after a while the cricket started up again . Against the eastern horizon 1 saw with relief the dim grayness of dawn through the trees . The light reassured me . I rolled over and went back to sleep . I awoke with a start . The bright glare of dawn shone in my face . There was a strong smell of smoke in the air . I felt weary , as if I had been struggling with things all night . I stared up at the low khaki camp netting over my bed , tasting smoke in my mouth and trying to think what . it meant . " Dad ? " I said . He lay on his side in the cot next to mine . " Ulm ph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " So do I , Pops , " Judy said from her cot . 76 SHOWER OF ASHES I heard Mother and Dianne stir . Father sat up and ntassaged his face . " Smells like thatch burning , " Judy said , getting out of bed . " Maybe that crazy woman 's trying to commit suttee . " Father sniffed the air . It is thatch , " he said . He was on his feet in an instant . I struggled into my bine jeans and got up . It was hard to tell where the smoke was coming From . " I think it 's coming from in there , " Judy said . She pointed to the shutters of the front room . Mother and Dianne joined us in their bathrobes . At that moment the study door opened . Travers came out onto the veranda . His hair was mussed , his face haggard . He looked surprised to find us awake . Father turned un him . " Where 's Mary ? " he said . " What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg pardon ? " he said . " She 's in there , now , is n't she ? " Father said , leveling a finger at Travers . He did not reply . " Get the jack handle , Matt , " Father said over his shoulder to me . He took a step toward Travers as if to intercept him should he attempt to interfere . I rushed out to the car and came back with the jack handle . Father was still facing Travers , ready to jump him if he moved . " Now break open a window , " Father said . Travers held up a hand . " I forbid you , " he said . " I forbid you to enter that room . " " Break it open , Matt , " Father said . " In God 's name , do n't , boy , " Travers cried . " You keep God 's name out of this , " Father said . I WORKED the jack handle between the shutters and pulled with all my strength . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shutter banged open against the wall . Travers seemed to wilt suddenly , as if we , having forced the latch of the secret room , had also violated something in him ? something that had to do with the core of his resistance . He slumped to the floor and sat with his head in his hands . " All right , now , " Father said , " let 's have a look in here . " He climbed in through the window . We pushed after him , no longer concerned with Travers but greedily determined to satisfy our morbid curiosity . In the bright glare of dawn flooding through the window I saw the bare room and the pile ofcharred thatch on the floor . The thatch appeared to have been recently extinguished . It still steamed . Little bits of ash floated in the air . ' The mad woman was lying on the floor , covered with a sheet like a corpse . Father stooped and raised the cloth . The breath caught in my throat . The cleaved , distorted , bulbous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that her skin was white , I would never have recognized her for Mary Travers . She looked at us for an instant , tears of shame and humiliation starting in her eyes , and then with a cry snatched the cloth back over her face . We hurried out of the room . Travers was still sitting on the veranda , his head lowered . " I tried to get her to see doctors , " he said . " I tried . But she would n't do it . She was so ashamed of what it had done to her face . She made me promise never to send her away , to put you off so we would not be forced to close out here . Only it was n't any use . She kept trying to burn herself . She thought burning might cure her . " For a moment none of us could move . We stood dumbly watching the broken , hunched . over Travers . Little pieces of ash began sifting out of the window , settling slowly . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sacrificed Mary Travers up to the demon of our suspicions , mentally mutilated and destroyed her in the belief that no man can exist without hidden guilt , only to find that we had convicted not Travers but ourselves . It only seemed to . make matters worse when , later that morning , Travers asked to be relieved of Siraikottai outpost .
