The future masters of industry ? replacing the Robber Barons of yesteryear ? are a handful of self-effacing men with modest incomes , who deliberately refuse to exercise their extraordinary power . THERE are some one thousand companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange . In about one quarter of these , members of the founding family or of the present management own effective control . In the great majority , however , the only large stockholders are institutional trustees for other people 's money : investment trusts , pension funds , and banks . Together these " fiduciary investors " have effective working control of these companies ? that is , of the commanding position in our economy . Their holdings amount to almost one third of all the marketable common shares of American business . By and large , these enormous holdings have been acquired in the past ten years . The pension funds only got going after World War II ; there were about two thousand then , there are twenty thousand now . Ten years ago both investment trusts and bank-managed personal trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security buying since then represents an unprecedented " democratization " of business ownership , for the real owners of these holdings are " small people , " the middle class and the workers . It also represents an unprecedented concentration of legal ownership , for the number of " fiduciary institutions " is fairly small . Despite its speed and importance , this shift has had amazingly little public attention . When General Motors set up its pension lurid sevenyears ago , it hired Clarance Stanley ? then a partner of Morgan , Stanley 8c Co. , the country 's most powerful investment bankers ? to manage the fund . There could be no more perfect example of the " capitalist revolution " than this move of J. P. Morgan 's direct successor from heading the very symbol of Wall Street to managing the savings of " proletarians " ? especially since it was quite obvious that Mr. Stanley was both bettering himself financially and acquiring much more financial power . Yet no new Horatio Alger rose to tell this twentieth-century version of " From Rags to Riches . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few financial pages . Anonymity , however , is exactly what our new masters prefer . The fiduciary managers arc as unlike the old Lords of Creation as they could possibly be . They run heavily to Pk D. degrees and Phi Beta Kappa keys . Their incomes generally are modest , usually much less than those of executives in the companies whose stock they manage . Rather than buy yachts , they build up good economic and statistical libraries . If any of them felt like playing the stock market for his own benefit , one or another government agency ? the Securities Exchange Commission , the State Insurance Commissioners , or the Banking Inspectors ? would have him thrown out in short order . And not one of them would ever dream of entertaining the chorus of a musical comedy-not even at the Automat . They are certainly the soberest , least conspicuous , and most studious of all of our managerial groups . It is unlikely that the public at large has even heard the names of men like Clarance Stanley of GM , Wallace Dunkel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts Investors Trust . Even in the financial community they are barely known : when the Fulbright Committee investigated the stock market earlier this year , none of them was called to testify . Yet they are the New Tycoons . " In financial importance and the impact of their decisions on the economy , they ? and the other managers of large investors ? represent more power than the tycoons of yesteryear ever dreamed of possessing . They could easily match resources with a Rockefeller or a Carnegie , the most lordly of the " old " tycoons whose names are still , half a century after their heyday , household words throughout the world . The Sears Roebuck pension fund owns 26 per cent of the stock of the world 's largest merchandising business ; the General Motors pension fund has almost 5100 million of new money to invest every year ; and the Massachusetts Investors Trust , largest of them all , has S763 million in assets . Even the small fry among them carry a lot of financial weight . The pension fund of the Owen-Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building in Toledo , Ohio ; the glass company itself is among its tenants . And the power and wealth of the New Tycoons is likely to grow still greater . Pension funds still cover little more than a sixth of American workers . A new push by the unions or fairly minor changes in the tax laws might at any time release a new tidal wave of pension-fund forma-don like that of the past few years . WHERE THE MONEY GOES T H E democratization of business owner- ship by the fiduciary investor is an achievement without parallel in economic or social history , but it is also a perplexing one . Indeed , the very things that made it possible are problematic . Our economy has made the small man the major supplier of capital ? but does enough of it go where it is needed to maintain a growing economy ? We have created appropriate institutions to manage the small man 's resources ? but do they put an adequate share of their venture capital into new or small business ? The fiduciary investors among them own about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly a prodigious amount , it may at first seem absurd to ask whether it is enough . But the fiduciary investors have become practically the only source of new common-stock capital . The New York Stock Exchange estimates that for every dollar of new money they spend onbuying common stock , only five cents arc invested directly by private investors ? and this in a period of rapidly rising stock-market prices . The pension funds alone receive each year a full third of all the savings the American people can afford to set aside for new investment . Yet only a fraction of the new money amassed each year by the fiduciary investors goes into common shares . All told , the fiduciary trustees have available for investment each year about nine billion dollars . Of this only a billion and a half , at the most , is invested in common stock . This is far too little for the needs of the economy . The amount of common-stock capital available largely dictates the amount of innovation and expansion business will undertake . Such activities are rightly financed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common stock ? rather than by borrowing . There is of course a second source of capital for such investments in the profits companies retain rather than pay out as dividends . But even if liberal allowance is made for this , the total amount available on the capital market for innovation and expansion is still too low . As an earlier article of this series pointed out , we now invest capital at the rate of $40 billion a year but will have to step up this rate considerably . Surely we need to put a larger share into venture capital than 4 per cent . There are , in fact , clear signs that the economy already is inadequately nourished with venture capital . One clue is the extent to which expansion and innovation has come to depend on profits retained and re-invested in the business . Since the end of World War II , such earnings furnished six or seven times as much venture capital as did the capital market . Only the large , well-established company can normally get capital for expansion and innovation from this source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? especially under our present tax laws ? with sufficient built-up earnings . They naturally invest in fields with which they are familiar ; more promising areas of economic enterprise may have to go without . Another symptom is the extent to which we now finance new ventures through fixed obligations like bonds , mortgages , or bank loans . Practically all new retail stores , for instance , have been financed up to a 100 per cent of cost by bank or insurance-company loans . The lender may be adequately protected ; it may be a safe investment for him ; but the borrower is assuming burdens which an earlier generation of retail THE NEW merchants would have looked upon with dismay . Traditionally , in a boom such as the one we have been experiencing , business cuts its fixed debts and replaces them with venture capital ? that is , with common stock . This has been the first boom in our history during which fixed obligations have become a larger , and not smaller , proportion of business capitalization . While our tax laws may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , it is hardly a desirable development . The classical argument against a " soak-therich " policy has always been that only the rich can supply the venture capital an expanding economy needs . If the middle classes and the workers can save money at all , it was said , they have to invest in the past rather than in the future . ( They tend to catch up with themselves , and get the things they previously could not afford , before they move ahead . ) But an economy that can not invest in the future is a dying economy . We are justly proud of having made the middle classes and working people capable of replacing the millionaire capitalist of old ? but the ancient argument that these new " capitalists " can not supply enough venture capital has still to be disproved . We have yet to discover how to channel an adequate part of the income of the New Tycoons into common stock . FALSE CONSERVATISM T HE KEY to this problem is in the hands of our oldest , largest , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $80 billion in assets , they represent greater financial power than all the trusts and pension funds put together . They are also trustees for many more people ? for thirty-two million ( out of a total of forty-two million ) American families , who hold 115 million individual life-insurance policies and group-insurance contracts . To most of these families the insurance policy represents their largest , often their only , capital asset . Yet the United States life-insurance companies ? and only those of the United States ? own virtually no common stock . Two fifths of their assets are invested in the bonds of private companies . Almost one third is in mortgages . Total common stock holdings are barely $2 billion , or less than .3 per cent . There are not even common stocks in the pension funds they manage . The banks that manage pension funds , however , put a third of their monies into common stock . This policy has an honorable history , but it has lung since lost whatever sense it used to make . To shun common-stock investments is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of " conservative . " The last depression certainly showed that sound common stock is safer than the mortgages on office buildings , apartment houses , and homes which figure so prominently in the portfolios of life-insurance companies ? safer even than a good many railroad or industrial bonds . The traditional policy is also far from advantageous to the life-insurance companies . It may explain why they have lost ground in the postwar period and now attract a smaller share of total savings than they did before the war . Though the life-insurance companies invented the pension fund , they get only a third of pension-fund business , primarily because the customers demand adequate common stock investments . " A worker who has a pension , " as one of the shrewdest managers of pension funds in this country points out , " does not expect a certain amount in dollars but a certain purchasing power , no matter how many dollars it takes to provide it . " And this means that pension funds , to be conservative , must carry a substantial amount of common stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years there have been numerous developments aimed at enabling insurance companies to buy common stock for investment . Thirty-eight states now allow them to buy in limited quantities . One company in New York has obtained permission from the state to set up a separate common-stock investment trust ; another in Ohio has recently purchased an investment trust and offers its certificate to life-insurance holders as an additional investment . The New York State Assembly in its last session passed a bill which would have allowed insurance companies to offer annuity contracts based on common-stock investment , with a flexible rather than a fixed dollar value , based upon the value of the stock in the future . Governor Dewey 's veto killed this bill , but it is commonly expected that it will soon be re-introduced . And a similar bill is now up for debate in New Jersey . There is in fact only one real obstacle left to large-scale common-stock buying by life-insurance companies : they have fixed liabilities to meet as soon as a claim arises . They therefore need fixed , or at least predictable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American industry follows the trcnd toward Automation , as suggested in last month 's article , this obstacle will grow bigger . Since production and labor force have to be kept fairly constant under Automation , the full burden of adjustment to economic ups-and-downs will fail on profits . Common stock earnings will fluctuate even more than they have traditionally . YET THERE is a way out of the impasse . Over any calendar year business profits will indeed have to fluctuate . But over a longer timespan ? three , five , in some businesses , ten years ? they can be predicted and planned , as a good many companies ( Armstrong Cork , General Motors , or the Telephone Company ) have successfully proven over the past twenty-five years . At the same time . the institutional investors , too , can adjust by planning on a five-year rather than a one-year basis ; or a business ( tax laws permitting ) might lay aside earnings in a good year to cover the dividend in a poor one . In other words , though it will take better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacle can be overcome . If the life-insurance companies invest one-fifth of their new money in common stock for the next ten years , at the end of the decade they will still have less than 10 per cent of their assets in common stock ? surely not an extravagant proportion . But this would almost double the supply of venture capital to the capital market ? and give us the base the economy needs to grow and to expand . But what about the small and growing business ? Practically without exception , the funds invested today in common stock go to the large , well-established companies . Only these companies can have their securities listed on the Stock Exchange ; and unlisted securities do not attract the fiduciary investor . The life-insurance companies , if and when they start to buy common stock , are certain to be even more concerned with the marketability of their holdings , and will he even more likely to channel their funds into the large and old company . Of course , the fiduciary investors would be grossly remiss in their duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketable and listed common stock . But the danger is also obvious ; it gives the big companies practically a monopoly on access td the means of growth . This may not represent a positive change for the worse , sincethe young business has always had difficulty obtaining equity capital . But it is certainly socially and economically undesirable that small and growing businesses should be limited , if not deprived , of access to the capital market . A solution to this problem has been found by the Massachusetts Investors Trust in Boston . Together with several small fiduciary investors , it has founded a company specifically intended to supply equity capital for new ventures : the American Development and Research Corporation . This company is sufficiently large for its shares to be listed on the Stock Exchange ; thus fiduciary trustees can invest substantial sums in it . Here might be the pattern for combining responsibility to the individual beneficiary with responsibility to society . Ultimately we might have a number of development companies , some within one region , some within one industry , others ( like American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . Whatever the device , finding it is a major responsibility for the fiduciary investor , and one that deserves high priority . WHO RUNS INDUSTRY ? P OWER and responsibility pose a final question ? and the toughest one . It can be simply stated : should the fiduciary trustees , in whose hands the real financial power of this country increasingly lies , exercise the right to control the management of companies whose legal owners they are ? Should they demand a place on the hoard of directors , appoint and remove management people , review and approve company decisions ? Are they entitled to exercise this control even though they are only " legal " owners ? Or should they take the attitude , as trustees , that they are neither entitled to nor responsible for the management of business ? They are investors , not entrepreneurs ; and the money they have invested is not theirs , anyhow . Should they religiously refrain from any control ? perhaps even be forbidden , as some industrial managements contend , from ever voting the stock which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . The answers will largely determine the structure of industrial society in the years to come . But when the first pension trust wfis started , forty or fifty years ago , these questions were scarcely considered . The Sears Roebuck profitTHE NEW sharing fund , probably the most successful of all , was started in 1916 . It blithely provided that the income of the fund should be invested in common stock of the company and that the officers of the company should vote the stock on behalf of the beneficiaries . But at that time , apparently , nobody foresaw that forty years later the pension fund would own 26 per cent of the company 's stock and be the only large stockholder . Today , on the other hand , the managements of fiduciary investors are so conscious of the power they could wield that they swing to the apposite extreme . In the charter of most new pension funds there is a provision forbidding purchase of the company 's own stock . Many of the funds even forbid investment in the stock of competing companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets of the fund may ever be invested in any one company . They provide further that no more than a small fraction ( 5 to 10 per cent ) of the capital of any one company may ever be purchased by the fund . And finally , by tacit consent , it is understood that the holdings of the funds will not be voted . " Our interest is purely financial , " the top man in one of the largest pension funds said to me . " We are not owners and we are not managers . If we do not like a company or its management , we sell the stock . We have neither right nor competence to control . We can only act as trustees , and it is quite clear that interference with management does not lie within the trust we have received . " The reasons for such self-restraint are good and compelling reasons . Even if no one of the fiduciary investors owned more than 5 or 10 per cent of a company 's stock , together they would dominate unless they voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think and act alike ; they are people with the same interests , the same training , and the same responsibilities . As for controlling the industry , it would really not make much difference whether there were one or twenty such fiduciary investors . By exercising their legal power , they would bring American industries under that most dubious of masters ? control by the financial mind . But how satisfactory is the alternative ? that is , the system we have now ? First , it is probably not good enough even to satisfy the present demands on the fiduciary by his principal , the individual investor . It is simply not true that the fiduciary institution can sell its shareholdTugs whenever it loses confidence in management . It owns so much that it can sell only to an equally large investor ? that is , to another fiduciary . And is it really likely that there will be demand for a big chunk of stock on the part of other fiduciary investors just when one of them decides that he wants to get out of an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate ? Precisely because they form the real capital market in this country today , the fiduciary investors can not liquidate their holdings except slowly . Their one way of passing judgment on a company is so drastic that it is virtually unusable . Thus the presently accepted policy means that management is essentially responsible to no. one . By their abstention from voting and control , in the majority of cases , the fiduciary institutions simply confirm the incumbent officers . A GOOD example of this is Montgomery Ward . A very substantial part of the company stock is in the vaults of investment trusts and pension funds . These holders have been far from satisfied with the way Mr. Sewell Avery has been running the company ? and they have said so openly . Yet they have refrained from voting against him , arguing that after all they do not really own the stock but merely represent the " real " owners . This has been one of the main reasons Mr. Avery could continue to manage without serious opposition to his decision to retrench ? to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to his methods of handling executives . At the same time , hypothetically , as long as they openly abstain from voting their stock as a matter of policy , the dominant holders can not save a competent management from being " blitzed . " All unwittingly , they invite the attention of any financial sharpshooter or stock market manipulator who wants to get control of a firm in order to milk it . If 40 to 60 per cent of the company voting stock is in the hands of fiduciary investors who will not vote , then control of the company can be obtained by buying up on the Stock Exchange 5 to 15 per cent of the stock ? a fairly small fraction . Then the raiding group can appeal to the scattered mass of small stockholders in a battle for proxies ; and the company that has been careful in building up property , or in plowing back earnings for expansion and research , is peculiarly vulnerable to such " blitzing " tactics . Its management can all-too-easily be made to look as though it had withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dividends . The fiduciary trustees are therefore caught in a genuine conflict of responsibility between the duties they owe to the beneficiaries of their funds , and the duties they owe to the country as guardians of its capital resources . They can not be allowed to exercise the full legal ownership power they possess . But at the same time they can not be absolved from their responsibility to make sure that the companies they " own " are managed professionally , competently , and with high standards of integrity . In other words , they are not just trustees of the individual saver or investor . They are also trustees of one of America 's most critically important resources , which is the performance and vision of our organized economic institutions . A NEW KIND OF ADVISER ? T HE PRESENT " hands-off " attitude is the right one for the time being . Until we know how the New Tycoons should discharge their responsibility , it is certainly better for them to be modest , self-restrained , and " strict constructionists " of their legal right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the long pull ; and while we do not have , as vet , any real solution , we do have some beginnings . Some of the fiduciary investors , for example , are thinking of bringing in a number of truly independent and objective advisers on management . Some of these advisers would he distinguished industrialists ; others , men in public or academic life . It would he their function to keep a watchful eye on the companies in which a fiduciary has a major investment , and to be in close touch with the management of these companies . These men ? while appointed for a specific period of time , compensated adequately , and completely outside of the control of the management of the fiduciary institution itself ? would have the responsibility to suggest when to drop the purely passive and self-restrained role of the " investor " and to assume a positive role as an " owner , " in which the legal rights of ownership and the voting power would be exercised . Similarly , some of the large publicly-owned companies ? conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest more and more in fiduciary-investor hands ? arc talking about the appointment to their own boards of directors of two or three men of similar standing . Their primary duty would be to establish liaison between the company and its major institutional owners , to advise management of the needs of the institutional holders and their beneficiaries , and in turn to keep the fiduciary institutions informed on the plans and decisions of management . This would mean in effect that the fiduciary investors , without themselves going on the hoard of a company , would have spokesmen and informants on the board to enable them better to judge when to act as if they were the real owners , and hoW . But these are the barest of beginnings . This is a big job ? much bigger , perhaps , than I have been able to indicate here . While it appears to be a matter of financial policy , the issue in essence is nothing less than the legitimacy of management in contemporary America ? that is , a society in which management is increasingly professional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anonymously and scattered in almost sub-atomic particles . This question of the legitimacy of management may well be the toughest yet to be answered by the modern industrial society . It is certainly a central one . In every other country the alternative to the " tycoon " of yesterday , the acquisitive robber baron , seems to have been government ownership . In this country we have found a different alternative , the democratization of ownership in which the real owners are increasingly the employees themselves . But , in order to accomplish this , we are increasingly forced to concentrate legal ownership of industry in the hands of a comparatively small number of fiduciary investors . To the problems thence arising , - clearly the solution lies in the realization on the part of these New Tycoons ? in the sharpest possible contrast to the tycoons of yesteryear ? that they have responsibilities both to the individuals for whom they manage their funds and to the commonweal , whose basic capital resources will be increasingly entrusted to their care .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
