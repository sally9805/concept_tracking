Political Geiger counters quivered in West Berlin last week . A political refugee who slipped across the line from East Germany was identified as Lieut . Colonel Fedor Nikolaevich Astakhov of the Red army . Astakhov is a geological wizard , a winner of the Stalin Prize , and until recently in charge of all technical operations in the Russian-run uranium mines in southeastern Germany . Allied intelligence would not confirm , but did not deny , that the new Soviet " defector of colonel 's rank " is Astakhov . If he is , the West has found a source of atomic intelligence as useful as Britain 's missing Bruno Pontecorvo presumably is to the Russians .
