Strawberries , Blueberries &; Men <P> O Mistress mine , where are you roaming ? <P> O , stay and hear ; your true love 's coming , <P> That can sing both high and low . <P> <P> Nonsense , snapped one Cora Carlyle last week .

" Open your eyes to the men around you . " <P> In an age in which most demands of social intercourse can be met by an ability to tune a television set , Miss Carlyle 's methods might seem eminently sound .
