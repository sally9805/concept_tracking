When " Project Icicle " was first discussed , few Air Force people besides Lieut . Colonel Joseph O. Fletcher had any real enthusiasm for it ; the idea of a weather station floating lazily through the Arctic Ocean on a huge island of ice seemed just too fanciful . But Joe Fletcher , then C.O. of the 58th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron at Fairbanks , Alaska , kept wheedling and nagging at his superiors . Last week Fletcher 's party finally fought their way on to the ice island some 100 miles from the North Pole . With a double-thickness tent , a month 's rations , primus stoves and a minimum of meteorological equipment , they set up camp . <P> New Landmark . Fletcher 's crusade began over a year ago when the radar operator of a B-29 flying the dogleg " Ptarmigan " track ( Alaska to the Pole ) reported that he had picked up a strange target-an " island " of some sort where there should have been nothing but spongy , saltwater ice pack ( TIME , Nov. 27,1950 ) . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic get monotonous , the crews took a lively interest in searching for a new landmark . <P> To Fletcher , T1 , as the first island was named , looked strangely like the great glacial ice-foot that puzzled Peary at the turn of the century . But if it was Peary 's giant ice-foot , it was circling slowly across the top of the world in the sea currents that swirl through the Arctic . It might make an ideal , stable platform for scientific observation . <P> Alert Ptarmigan crews turned up two more islands , named them T-2 and T3 . Fletcher studied them , picked T-3 for his weather station . Then he convinced Major General William D. Old that it was time to organize Project Icicle . The time to land on T3 , they decided , was shortly after mid-March . The earth would be tilted properly on its axis and they would have the benefit of 24-hour daylight . <P> Nightmare White . Last week a ski-equipped C-47 of the 10th Rescue Squadron ferried Fletcher , Captain Marion F. Brinegar and Norwegian-born Dr. Kaare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships flew along to navigate and drop supplies . The only newsman on the expedition : LIFE Photographer George Silk . <P> In a nightmare of white haze , white snow and blinding Arctic glare , the C-47 pilot picked out a landing area . Time after time he skimmed low over the island , slapping his skis on hummocks of ice , skipping from crest to crest like a stone over water . For nearly an hour he made passes at the island before he landed and slued to a halt . Photographer Silk crawled from the plane to shoot his pictures. * General Old , who had flown as copilot , trudged back up the plane 's ski tracks in the 60-below-zero cold . " I do n't see how a man can live here , " he told Fletcher when he had staggered back . <P> But Colonel Fletcher had come too far to quit . The two-men stood within a foot of each other , their hands over their faces , mumbling against the cold that numbs men 's minds . Every now &; then they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually Fletcher won the argument . He and his two assistants were permitted to stay , and General Old pitched in to help unload supplies .
