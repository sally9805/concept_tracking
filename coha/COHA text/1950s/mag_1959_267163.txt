BRIGHTEST star among the bright young architects of the 1930s was a dour-looking , dynamic Finn named Alvar Aalto . His TB sanatorium at Paimio , Finland , with its cantilevered decks , was a landmark in the new international style . Almost singlehanded he had made wood a " modern material , " used it in a dazzling variety of ways-an undulating ceiling for a library in Viipuri , an undulating wall for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York World 's Fair-and the tastemakers of the era all sat in Aalto 's curved plywood chairs . But as the glass-and-steel revolution sparked by Mies van der Rohe swept into power after World War II , Alvar Aalto ( rhymes with hall-toe ) dropped out of sight , seemed close to becoming architecture 's forgotten man . <P> Today architects are developing uneasy qualms as the glass-curtain wall begins to turn whole streets into reflecting canyons and reinforced concrete seems headed toward a kind of new brutalism . As a result , the buildings Aalto has been quietly erecting among the pine forests and birch trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reevaluation . Result : Aalto 's reputation is once again skyrocketing . <P> Man at Center . Actually , the times have changed more than Aalto . His use of traditional materials-wood , brick , copper-and rough textures now seems a welcome antidote to too much slickness and gloss . Aalto still insists as firmly as ever : " Architecture-the real thing-is only to be found when man stands in the center . " <P> At the age of 61 , Aalto remains a prickly individualist who drinks hard , works all hours of the day and night . Once while designing Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Baker House in 1947 , he turned out the whole staff at midnight , for three hours paced the office floor without a word , thinking furiously , finally dashed off the drawings . Believing that " the Creator created paper for making architectural drawings , " Aalto refuses to open mail , replies only to telegrams . Accepting a commission to act as a consultant to Helsinki 's city planning commission , he insisted on a clause that the city fathers would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he controls the design to the smallest detail . As a man , he stays in tiptop shape , swimming in the icy Finnish lakes in summer , going cross-country on skis during the winter . <P> Gathering Place . To keep on working while enjoying a change of scene , Aalto maintains three bases of operation . One is an office in downtown Helsinki , another his studio on the outskirts , which he calls " the fortification of quiet " ; still another is his island hideaway , where he can plunge into the lake on a moment 's notice with his pretty new wife Elissa . She is an architect herself ( as was his first wife , Aino , who died in 1949 ) , works on his staff .
