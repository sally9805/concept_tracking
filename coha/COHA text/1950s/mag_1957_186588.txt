Beyond the power plays and dickerings that whirled around the Jordan crisis , Washington last week rated as the diplomatic news of the week another prime accomplishment : after months of threat , war and negotiation , the Suez Canal was open for business again . True enough , it was open on Nasser 's terms , as he made clear in a unilateral declaration deposited with the United Nations Security Council . But in laying out the terms , Nasser made important concessions by pledging himself to : " Respect the terms and spirit " of the 1888 Constantinople Convention , which provided that the canal " shall always be free and open ... to every vessel of commerce or of war , ' without distinction of flag " ( although-as the convention specified ambiguously-Egypt can take any measures necessary for her own defense ) . Refer differences of interpretation between Egypt and signers of the Constantinople Convention to the International Court of Justice in The Hague . Submit complaints about discrimination by the . Canal Authority to an " arbitration tribunal , " with one member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the third by both together or by the International Court . <P> Refrain from upping tolls by more than 1% a year without negotiation or arbitration , and set aside 25% of gross receipts each year for a canal development and improvement program . <P> For four weeks Arabic-speaking U.S. Ambassador Raymond A. Hare patiently tried to persuade the Egyptians to make the plan more satisfactory to the West by 1 ) changing it from a unilateral declaration of intention into something more formal , e.g. , a multilateral treaty , 2 ) writing into it formal arrangements for cooperation between Egypt and canal users , and 3 ) acknowledging the six-point , Western-sponsored canal resolution voted by the United Nations Security Council last October . In talks with Nasser and Foreign Minister Mahmoud Fawzi , Hare did manage to get them to make some minor improvements in their original version , e.g. , by adding a provision that arbitration-tribunal decisions " shall be made by a majority , " meaning that the Egyptian member will have no veto . But on the other three points Nasser refused . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France-and even the U.S.-to swallow , since Western diplomacy had been bent on getting Nasser 's signature on a treaty of some sort ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge announced in the U.N . Security Council that the U.S. 's " de facto acquiescence " was " provisional , " depending on how the declaration " is carried out in practice . " But as a U.N . diplomat put it in a corridor aside : " Since the U.S. does n't want war and Britain and France do n't want economic sanctions , the only thing we can do is accept what we all know : it 's Nasser 's ditch . " <P> Nasser 's pledge was certainly not the best or even the most hopeful protection for the ships that sail the Suez . But in cold fact a treaty would be little better than a pledge if he intended to violate and subvert it . The true proof will come in his actions .                   @ @
