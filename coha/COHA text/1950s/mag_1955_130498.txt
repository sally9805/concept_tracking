I never pay no attention to who wins . I never go to the race track unless I have something running or sometimes for a real good race . " Meshach " Mish " Tenney , Swaps 's trainer , was talking . " Never bet , " he continued . " Never do care to see other horses run . What good will it do me if I do know how they run ? I ca n't tell my horses about the other ones . The only thing you can do for a race horse is control him . Get him fit and get him out the gate fast . What the others do has nothing to do with how good your horse is going to do . " // Tenney strapped on his leather blacksmith 's apron . He stood under the shed row of barn No. 57 in the Hollywood Park stable area . A moment before the loudspeaker had crackled urgently with a description of the fourth race . Tenney ignored the interruption . // " We do lots of things different from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallop on the track . We ride ' em at a walk around the track and paddock . That schools them and also gives them a cooling-out process . Then when they get back to the barn we let them take a good drink of water . When a horse is not hot , you can let him drink all he wants . // " Some stables feed their horses three times a day . We do it twice  --  at 4 in the morning and then in the afternoon at 3 . I do n't see no advantage to feeding more'n twice a day . Fact is , I suppose you could feed only once a day . // " Everything is on the floor . I think it helps a horse to eat or do anything else with his head down . It improves his circulation . " // Tenney braced the left forefoot of a colt named Terrang between his legs and began to pare the hoofnail. // " What we like to do when we train yearlings is go into their stall on our cow ponies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him against the stall . We put the reins on him and then we take him out in the lane and gallop him . All the time he 's goin ' , our pony 's right head-to-head with him . That way every move you make with him , you educate his mouth to the reins . If he stampedes , you can stampede with him  --  even if he takes a quarter of a mile to settle down . You 're in a position to catch him up every time till he 's educated . // " Then you can lean over him , slap him on the back , shoo flies off'n him , everything you can think of to gentle him . You get him so used to a man across his back that by the time a kid gets on him and goes to kicking him to make him go , it ai n't much different . // " Anytime you hear anyone ca n't handle a horse , you just make the brag you can handle him . Then put a pony in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Tenney squinted over to stall No. 18 where Swaps stood munching his oats . " It ai n't always horses are that easy to gentle . Swaps here . The day he won his 2-year-old stakes last year , we were pretty sure we were n't going to get him shod , he was so wild . Fact is , he was a little on the lazy side far as work went as a 2-year-old. // " We keep our horses content because we always give them a clear understandable signal of everything we want them to do . When there 's nothing to do , we give them their head . See the way Glenn is holding this colt ? Loose . Not like some of those other stable hands . They grab a horse right up around the mouth and jerk his head down . How 'd you like to have somebody pulling your head down to your chest ? We do n't spoil ' em either and we do n't confuse ' em . Not like those parade horses you see that have to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pulls on them . The horses try to go and ca n't and this is what makes them prance. " // Tenney was asked about the Ellsworth ranch . " ' Course I 'm not saying those big farms with lots of open pasture are n't good . I would like to raise horses on them . But I think horses can be raised anywhere the climate is n't too severe one way or the other . If you furnish the feed , exercise and care , you can raise a horse without green grass around . It would help you to have thousands of acres in Maryland maybe , but you do n't have to have all that land . I know one thing : the horses do n't know the difference . // " Matter of fact , we raised our horses just as well in Arizona where it 's really dry . California gives a percentage of the purses to breeders whenever the winners are California-breds . So we used to breed our horses in California , then move ' em to Arizona . But that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . " // The subject switched to how Owner Rex Ellsworth came to buy Khaled , Swaps 's great sire . " Rex talked to me about it some , " Tenney said . " He dug Khaled out of those books . He picked out Nasrullah first but he talked to me for days about Khaled . The last couple of weeks before he went to England he studied those books like you would study something that means your life . He showed me how he could pick out what he wanted from the stifles , the shape of the head , the length of the body , whether the hocks or ankles were good , whether the girth was too thick . Rex is the best conformation man I ever saw . He can look at a horse and predict whether he 'll make a great runner or a good stud. // " Khaled turned out a good runner but after he 'd won some races we decided to sell his services . His stud fee was high . // " Swaps was with the last crop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way we looked at it , Swaps had no more , no less chance than the others . The thing is , if you know a horse has speed and his relations did well , you know he 's a good horse . // " Swaps was fast all right , but he had courage too . That 's something you find out as you go along . Swaps is game . He 'll struggle when you ask him to . " // BACK IN KENTUCKY // " When we took him back to Kentucky , I thought he had a real good chance along with Nashua and Summer Tan . I thought it was going to be a real good race . // " We knew Swaps was ready after his last workout here . We put him in a ? - mile race and I told Shoe Jockey Willie Shoemaker that we wanted him run as slow as we could in the first half and as fast as we could at the end . We wanted him to restrain that horse till the stretch . Well sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he still ran within one-fifth of the track record for three-quarters and ran out another eighth to equal the track record for seven-eighths. // " We were looking for distance and stamina , not speed . We wanted to give him the habit of keeping calm the first part of a race . // " Since the Derby everybody 's been talking about a match race with Nashua . Well , we 're going to Chicago and then down to Garden State . My feeling is when you get two horses like that in the same area , there 's always a chance they 'll meet . But we 're not planning it or training toward it . I 'm just going about my business of raising a stable of horses . // " People have been saying Swaps is a great horse . I suppose he is . On past performance you could call him that . But we 'll have to wait till he 's older and see . A horse has to go through his handicap period before you can call him great . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a look about ' im. "
