NEW REPUBLIC Why Is He a Candidate ? Mr. Stevenson Replies ON THE eighth floor of the Continental Bank Build- ing in . Chicago , in the panelled rooms that once housed a finance company , are the law offices of Adlai E. Stevenson , W. Willard Wirtz , William McCormick Blair , Jr. , and Newton R. Minow . The last of the four , the youngest , is a working lawyer ; the second clings to his practice . And in the corner room to which the grave and gentle Bill Blair leads visiting delegations of assemblymen from Oklahoma , students from Indo China , journalists from West Germany , and politicians from Chicago 's south side , a few volumes of Illinois Revised Statutes and Federal Administrative Law still stand on the shelves to testify to the profession that Adlai Stevenson intended to follow after his defeat in 1952 . They serve now for decoration as Stevenson struggles to keep ahead of the 160 daily telephone calls that demand urgent attention , the 400 letters that go out over his name each day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , sits Stevenson , a little heavier than in 1952 , but fast in his movements , astonishingly fast in grasping new ideas , still very much a man in his prime . I believed that if Stevenson were to seek out the Presidency in 1956 , he would need to voice compelling reasons for his initiative . The first of my questions , accordingly , was : What central reason leads you to believe that the Republican Party should be turned out of office in 1956 ? Stevenson read it over " These , " he said , are the things I 'm against . " I 'm against the concept of single-interest government ; the domination by one group of democratic government , and thereby the exclusion from participation in government of the people to whom it should be responsible . ? " I 'm against the habit of professing one thing and doing another : of announcing a school program and then doing nothing about it ; of firing a Talbott and at the same time decorating him ; of proclaiming the indispen- sability of Indo-China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and day out on having it both ways . " I 'm ' against the . Administration 's erratic and vacillating foreign policy . I think it highly damaging . I mean the easy use of frightening phrases like ' massive retaliation ' ; the playing fast and loose with honored traditions of diplomacy ; the subordination of valued allies in vitalprograms overseas to the internal prejudices and squabbles of the Republican Party . " I 'm against the forms of fiscal piety that seem to me so hypocritical ; the talk about the responsibilities of all citizens to bear the national financial burden , and at the same time the constant efforts to take care of one group . Let 's be honest fiscally . Let 's say that when inflation threatens we maintain taxes and reduce the debt , and when hard times come we reduce taxes and expand purchasing power . And let 's keep to this honest policy instead of the present combination of pious pretension , and insidious action to manipulate tax reductions around election time , for the sake of votes . " Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill of Rights , with all the cardinal virtues . You asked me , " Stevenson continued , shaking off his tiredness and speaking with rising feeling , " why I want to turn out the Republicans in 1956 . It 's because I am persuaded that if this group holds power much longer all these evils may be fastened upon the country with a grip which I for one fear . " If for no other reason , I want to get this group out of office because I believe that in an era of bigness , of concentration of power , this coalescence of government , of business , of money , and of the press in the present Administration has joined together too much power in one place for the good of the country , and ? well , it 's time for a change ! " Stevenson 's mood changed then Horn earnestness to light-heartedness . " All in all , " he said , grinning , " I guess I do n't feel good about this Administration ! " Does Stevenson have a better vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used for the general welfare that leads him now to seek out the Presidency ? My second question was : Do you have a foreign and domestic program in mind , in addition to your concept of ' honest political leadership ' , whose achieve-ment makes a Democratic victory urgent in 1956 ? " To be sure , " Stevenson answered , " we have no single issue such as depression or war ? and I 'm thankful we have n't . We do have all the issues , of power , of resources , of farm income , of health and education , and they 're all a part of our central theme of an expanding economy . That theme , in turn , reflects the compassion for people , the concern for people , that distinguishes our party from the Republicans . The place where the two parties separate , in my opinion , should be and still is the concern of the one for the many , and of . the other for the few . " " Your next question , " said Stevenson reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also it 's loaded . But I 'll try to answer it . " The question was : Do you believe that the accepted role of the Presidency has changed during the last three years ? What is your concept of the Presidential role ? How , for example , would you bridge the gap between party leader and national leader ? " The President , " said Stevenson , " has met the demands of his office in accordance with his own gifts . He is a conciliator by nature and a staff operator by training to whom the role of political leader is novel . " In general terms , I see the Presidency as far more than the job of presiding as chairman of the board . I see , it as the most important executive responsibility in all the world , to me that responsibility dictates an active role in the development of policy and a determination that , once developed , sound policy is understood and accepted and carried out . " A strong ' President , I suppose , can be both party leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indispensable mechanism of his purpose ; his conscience is the nation 's . He must , one might say , be a party man who keeps his conscience clear . For you have to live with your conscience , even if you live in the White House . " My fourth question reflected a fear that in defeat the Republican Party may relapse into irresponsibilty and extremism , and a conviction that the calmer and saner spirit we have achieved under President Eisenhower , is too precious to be lost . Stevenson read out : How would you prevent the break-up of national unity , the renewal of domestic tension , the return to prejudice engendered by the opposition party and enlarged by the press following a Democratic victory ? Stevenson 's answer was to treat intolerance as an American rather than as a Republican problem . " Of course , there will be opposition , " he said " A good deal of it will arise from sources beyond any man 's control . In times of unemployment or disillusionment ? . people have to focus their frustration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scape-goat is chosen by the authorities to save , their own skins . In a democracy authority itself becomes the scape-goat . " We are , of course , better off , in this regard than we were four years ago . And yet I 'm afraid that there re . mains in this country a powerful group that profits from criticism for criticism 's sake . They have gained from the erosion of confidence caused by their sustained attack upon those who bear the uncomfortable burdens of responsibility . So they may try it again . I would hope only that if this kind of utterly irresponsible opposition arises after 1956 , then the next President of this country will not hesitate to identify it , to confront it , and to fight it from the outset , even if it arises within his own party . " My last question was personal : In 1952 you seemed to be haunted by a sense of personal inadequacy in approaching the Presidency . Have you changed since then in your appraisal of yourself ? " In 1952 , " said Stevenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can never get across to the press ? I could not run for the Presidency . It was n't as though I was a private citizen . I was the Governor of a major state , and I had just been chosen , without opposition in the primary , as my party 's candidate for another term . I could not say ' on Tuesdays and Thursdays I will run for Governor , and on Wednesdays and Fridays for President . ' But the press could never accept that simple truth ! " " Today , " he added , " no man with an awareness of the times and of his own limitations can pound his chest as a Presidential candidate . No man worthy of that honor and responsibility can say , ' here boys look me over , I 've got the brains , I 've got the moral stature and the physical stamina , I 've got all it takes ! " " And yet , " Stevenson reflected , " If a man grants his limitations , then his opponents point to him and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " There ' is , of course , a difference in my appraisal of myself now and four years ago . I was as busy as a bird dog then at Governor of Illinois . We had accomplished in two sessions the largest program ever adopted in an equivalent length of time in any state . My job had shifted over night from the United Nations to the horizons of the Mississippi and the Wabash . I had saturated myself in a 90-hour week mastering the details of state administration ? and I loved it . Suddenly to be thrust again into the limitless expanse that I had n't touched was inevitably a sobering experience . It was also a per- plexing dilemma in its conflict of responsibility and trust . If I had said then , ' folks I 'm your candidate for Governor , and I 'd also like to be considered for President ' why that would have been intolerable ! I would n't have deserved either candidacy ! " Now , I have been absorbed by national or international issues for three solid years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less .. . " Stevenson paused , in search of the right word . " Diffident , " suggested Harry Ashmore , a staff adviser who was sitting with us . You know , " Stevenson added , " there was a time not long ago when I could tell you how many hospital beds had been added in my term of office , in Springfield , how many miles of road built , how many saplings , planted . I do n't suppose , " he said regretfully , " that I could do it any more . " ( Continued from page 9 ) its logic is to conclude that we can not afford to give our children an adequate education because we are too rich . Only if we experience the good fortune of mass unemployment , according to this doctrine , can we afford to devote our dollars and manpower to tackling overcrowded schools , and avoidable diseases and slums . " I faced this situation in my own state of Illinois when I succeeded a Republican Administration , " Stevenson told a college audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the richest states in the union , had one of the lowest ratings for state aid to common-school education in the whole United States . The revival , the strengthening and the doubling in four years , of the state 's contribution to our school distributive fund , was one of the most satisfying experiences I have had in my regime as Governor . Stevenson favors today an immediate program of federal aid to education . So do all of the prominent contenders for the Democratic nomination in 1956 . Governor Mennen Williams of Michigan , for example , has spelled out , in more detail than Stevenson , and in larger amounts , the federal grants he would appropriate for teachers ' salaries and school construction . The break with traditional doctrine that Stevenson brings to the debate is his preoccupation with the quality and purpose of the education that he wants the federal , government to help finance . ? No precise definition of this break can be found in Stevenson 's speeches . Yet it resembles the approach set forth by Arthur Bestor in his study , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States most problems ? have first been thought of as quantitative problems . Eventually they have to be dealt with as qualitative ones . In every enterprise there comes a time when the law of diminishing returns sets in so far as mere physical expansion is concerned . . . . A preoccupation with quality , and a refusal to approach any problem in terms only of rigid doctrine are presumably what Stevenson points toward when he demands a change from the present Republican Administration and at once adds , " I do n't mean a change back to - a warmed-over New Deal . " What kind of a change in substance does Stevenson mean ? He has voiced no clear view as yet on agriculture nor the regulation of monopoly . He has insisted that it is foolish to call TVA " Communism " ? and so he has avoided the public power issue , ? for no responsible critic of TVA has called it that . To return to education , how will Stevenson approach the problem of insolvency that threatens our universities ? In his article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune , Stevenson affirms that our business corporations will have to assume a major responsibility for financing higher education in America . Here he follows the analysis of A. A. Berle , but without mentioning any of the perils of corporate control of education which Berle recognizes . In general his discussion of business leaves one confused . In coming months , of course , Stevenson and his advisers will fill out the gaps in his program . For the moment what is interesting is his break in general terms with the Fair Deal . In principle the break is logical ; for ten years of expansion and of research have passed since the social objectives of the Fair Deal were laid down . In practice Stevenson 's break with the past alienates some of the veterans of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations , but it attracts young people to him ; they want to move on . * * * * " I see the Presidency . . . as the most important executive responsibility in all the world , " Stevenson declares in the interview that accompanies this assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 35th President , beyond an instinct for priorities , and a dear concept of what the priorities entail . It is not of primary importance- ?  - -  Abraham Lincoln for example was a poor administrator who interfered erratically in the operations of his cabinet members and filed state papers in the sweatband of his stove-pipe hat ? and yet the federal government has grown so immense , and become such a part of each community that executive incompetence in the NOVEMBER 21 , 1935 White House can cause endless trouble in the , nation . George Washington felt overburdened by the tasks of supervising three departments of government and six minor agencies . Harry Truman , in contrast , was held responsible for the work of nine major departments , 104 bureaus , 12 sections , 108 services , 81 branches , 460 offices , 621 divisions , 19 administrations , six agencies , 16 areas , 40 boards , six commands , 20 commissions , 19 corporations , five groups , 10 headquarters , three authorities and 263 miscellaneous bits of government machinery . Dwight Eisenhower endeavored to defend himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of staff work in the White House . He saw only top subordinates ; he adjudicated only final disputes . The price he paid for this relative freedom from detail was to remove himself from contact with a healthy variety of viewpoints and to deny himself knowledge as to what was taking ' place in his administration . Stevenson , in contrast , runs himself ragged in an effort to master detail . It was with some effort that his sister dragged him from his desk in the Governor 's Mansion to meet his guests each Christmas Day . This country lives in the present , and in our present preoccupation with Stevenson the Orator , Stevenson the Governor of Illinois has become ' a forgotten man . The Governor , however , was an able administrator . " There are only three rules of sound administration , " Stevenson later wrote ; " pick good men , tell them not to cut corners , and back them to the limit ; and picking good men is the 13. most important . " Stevenson followed his three rules in Springfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments of State Government . He backed them , and in four years he accomplished more than any other governor had done in a comparable period in the history of Illinois . He eliminated useless workers on the state payroll , put state purchasing on a businesslike basis , took politics out of the state police and the Commerce Commission , enacted a major road and hospital construction program , knocked out commercial gambling and enforced the laws setting maximum weights for trucks . He pushed through 78 government reorganization bills and a modernization of the state 's antiquated constitution . He pressed hard but unsuccessfully for a state Fair Employment Practices Commission but abolished . segregation in the Illinois National Guard . More recently Stevenson 's administrative capacity has come to be judged by his staff work during the 1952 campaign . The impression left then upon newspapermen was poor . Stevenson had been thrust without planning into a national campaign . He reacted by promoting trusted friends and assistants who had worked with him in Illinois to his press staff and to the top leadership of the Volunteers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the state level failed in attempting to cope with the larger professional problems of a Presidential campaign . Now the newspapermen , are again watching Stevenson as he picks his key staff men . This time there is no excuse for improvisation , and Stevenson 's choices will be watched as clues to the kind of men he would surround himself with and the ways in which he would use them after November , 1956 . Stevenson 's probable campaign manager is the respected James Finnegan , who rose through the ranks of the Democratic Party and/ whose operations in 1952 helped to make Philadelphia one of the few bright Democratic spots in a national defeat . Archibald Alexander , State Treasurer of New Jersey and one of the ablest intellectuals in politics , is likely to direct the reborn Volunteers , an organization which Stevenson sees as indispensable , both in organizing the independents , and in keeping the professionals in line . Harry Ashmore has left the editorship of the influential Arkansas Gazette to manage Stevenson 's public relations . Roger Tubby , who served ably as President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only man missing in the picture is a Tom Corcoran , the brilliant combination of politician and poet , field general and idea man , whose first drafts of great speeches were more Roosevelt than Roosevelt himself . But with Stevenson such a man , if he could be found , could not last long . Stevenson can not , as Eisenhower did , take another man 's work and read it off as his own . He would regard this as intellectual dishonesty . It is an act of faith with him to disappear for two days in order to work on a minor speech . Thousands of votes may have been lost in 1952 because Stevenson was polishing the style of his speeches when he should have been polishing political apples . His absorption with his own drafts added to his reputation for aloofness , which is still a serious political liability . In exchange , as the nation- suffers with him while he wrestles with the farm program , or rises with him in his eloquence , it knows that it is seeing the candidate himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An unknowing audience , given an Eisenhower speech to identify , may name a hundred different orators . . Stevenson 's whistle-stop speeches , his best , could only have been given by one man . Only one man could have spoken as Stevenson did , for example , , on November 4 , 1952 , when he encountered a band of children in a school yard used as a polling place : ? . . . I think you are going to remember today for one thing only , that you got a half day off from school . I am sure I have enjoyed this as much as you have and I would like ' to spend the recess this morning playing with you in the school yard . But I do n't know what we would play . What would . we play ? ( Shouts , " Baseball ! Football ! " ) The same old fight between the cattlemen and the sheepmen . Would n't anybody like to have a little mock game of politics ? ( A little boy : " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid who did n't like a mud fight ! . . . ? - Nor could any ghost writer match the grace of his extemporaneous speech of farewell of August 14 , 1952 , at the Illinois State Fair : . . - Before I leave I want to say to you shamelessly and sentimentally that my heart will always be here in Illinois . Here five generations of my family have lived and prospered . My roots are deep in our prairies and I owe Illinois a great debt . I have tried my best to discharge that debt honorably and well . But in the process I have only increased my obligations . * * * The 35th President , if he is to do what the times demand , will have to fight for measures whose enactment and execution will be hotly opposed . This is particularly true if the next President is a Democrat , for the Democratic Party is the party of reform , and in promoting change it must expect and overcome the resistance of powerful interests . For this reason , as party leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give life andvitality to his projects , to mobilize his party behind them in the Congress and , when the Congress balks , to bring public opinion to bear on the Congress , on behalf of his aims . As Governor of Illinois Stevenson demonstrated those qualities . And yet among Democrats ; a doubt persists that he possesses a feeling for people , an ability to communicate , a human warmth ; a common touch of the kind that made Harry Truman President in 1948 . Stevenson , these critics will grant , aroused an almost fanitical devotion among professional groups in 1952 . These groups , the critics will add , are highly vocal but they do n't win elections . Pressed for details the critics will point to the disappointing turnout in traditionally Democratic areas in 1952 . The votes prove , they maintain , that farmers never warmed to Stevenson and that to labor he was just not " their kind of a guy . " - One kind of reservation ( which concerns Stevenson as a candidate rather than as a President ) points to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . " In 1952 , " one Democrat recalls , " we were driving across the fields to the farm rally in Kasson . We were urging Stevenson to make a real give-'em ? hellHarry speech . About then a weatherbeaten old farmer runs out of the crowd . ' Give ' em ? give ' em heck , Adlai ! ' he cries . " But if this quality is a liability with some voters , others are drawn to Stevenson by his reverence for restraint . A second reservation concerns Stevenson 's unwillingness to generate mass support . " Slum clearance is a crying need for America , " the critic argues . " Tell me when Adlai Stevenson last visited a slum ? Automation is causing layoffs by the hundreds of thousands ; when did Adlai last talk to the men on an assembly line ? Farmers are going bankrupt by the thousands right now . When they listen to Adlai wrestling with himself on the subject of parity , do they feel he 's on their side ? When Emmett Till was murdered down in Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man wanted to protest . Where was the leader of the party of justice then ? " A third reservation , often heard , concerns Stevenson 's use of unfamiliar images , abstract arguments , involved sentences and polysyllabic words . " The people do n't think he talks above them , " Stevenson 's advisers insist . " The heck they do n't ! " a labor leader ( who is ardently for Stevenson ) replies . He continues : I was speaking to a trade union conference not long ago , and I said , " How many of you here understand Stevenson ? " " Oh , we all understand him , " they answered , " it 's just that the other guys do n't . " A woman came up to me afterwards . " They do n't understand him either , " she whispered . " They 're ashamed to admit it , that 's all . " A further reservation concerns Stevenson 's unwillingness to undertake the political chores demanded both of a successful candidate and of a President who keeps in close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first choice , " agrees a trade union official . " And yet , " he adds , " I scratch labor and I find indifference . Walter Reuther is for him , of course , and so are Jacob Potofsky and Dave Dubinsky . So is George Meany , I suppose . The rest are lukewarm to cold . Do you know why ? It 's because Stevenson has never called them up , never said ' come on over for a chat . ' He assumes that they must be interested in what he has to say . But he 's never indicated that he 's interested in their point of view . Take Averell Harriman for comparison . When he arrives in a town he takes out his black book and starts to telephone . When he leaves town there is n't a trade union official who has n't picked up the receiver and heard the Governor of . New York . " There is a final reservation concerning Stevenson as a President who can carry the people with him ? it is that at heart he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly some truth . It is said of Senator Hubert Humphrey that he can return to Minnesota ashen-faced and exhausted after months in Washington , set out on tour , speak 10 times a day for a week , and sleep four hours a night and then return , to Washington as fresh as a daisy. , Stevenson , in contrast , is more enervated than nourished by adulation . Franklin Roosevelt was a great President in part because he loved to hold the federal power . For Stevenson , again , power is more headache than aspirin . This last reservation is perhaps the most serious of all in assessing Stevenson 's qualifications for the Presidency . For Americans do not want as their President a man who does not want to be President . They remember that in his acceptance speech in 1952 Stevenson referred to the " dread responsibility " of the Presidency . They recall that he added , " I have not sought the nomination . . . . I would not seek it in honest self-appraisal . . . . " They wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Roosevelt and the disability of Dwight Eisenhower have convinced them that today the Presidency is a killing job . They realize that it demands a man who is mentally , emotionally , and physically prepared . They believe that self-doubt and hesitation in a candidate may lead to paralyzing indecision in a President once he is subjected to the Presidency 's fearful strains . They see in Richard Nixon a man who entertains no shred of doubt that he would make one whale of a President . And this much at least in Nixon they respect . They know that Stevenson does not possess Nixon 's self-salesmanship . They wonder if he possesses Nixon 's self-confidence . There is no doubt that Adlai Stevenson has overcome his inner reluctance , his hesitation , his self-doubt . But he has yet to convey the change to the American people . Among these criticisms , then , some relate to a former time . But others concern traits of personality that are not likely to change radically . For these traits are part , not only of a steadfast personality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he travels overseas , will not send postcards by the thousands to precinct workers back home in the manner of the indefatigable Ekes Kefauver . His refusal to do so reflects the fact that winning is not his highest goal. , It is , probable moreover that Stevenson will always prefer the company of a Harvard historian or a Chicago North Shore squire to that of an official of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters or a . convention delegate who claims to control five votes . He may be told a thodsand times that a leader of the people , in these days of press and television , is a wholly public personality whose every movement the people must watch and approve . He will stand fast on his conviction that the right of privacy is fundamental and that , just as he respects it in the public , so the public must respect it in him . Stevenson will not oversimplify issues nor limit himself to words of three syllables . He will resist making ... 46.0.44. promises that he can not fulfill . He will not change his ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality of the Vice President appears to be changing these days from partisan to statesman . Stevenson respects " After you , my dear Avereil. " the American people and treats them as his equals . 16 NEW REPUBLIC Stevenson lost in 1952 , for a powerful vision of a better time is at any time more appealing than ' the promise to preside over grim and bloody years . And yet Stevenson 's faith in the power of reason was unaltered . " It is only in the very long run that its effects become perceptible . " Without doubt Stevenson 's reliance on reason weakens him today among the militant forces that make up the backbone of the Democratic Party . But it gives him the added appeal that other candidates lack . For example , it persuades the South that he is a man of moderation , and therefore Stevenson alone among the Democratic candidates is able to gain the indispensable precondition of success , the support of a united party . Stevenson 's reliance on reason gives him further strength as a President , in his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to reason with the Illinois Republicans . And his second term in office , when the Republicans held both branches of the Illinois legislature , was more successful than the first , when they held only one . Stevenson 's bipartisanship is of a deeper kind than Eisenhower 's . More than once . Stevenson has been outraged by the President 's action in appointing Republicans who wear a Democratic label to key posts on the regulatory agencies that true Democrats are entitled to hold by law . In the heat of the 1954 campaign Vice-President Nixon linked the Democratic Party to subversion and President Eisenhower predicted that a Democratic Congress would result in a partisan cold war . Stevenson at that moment told a Democratic rally in Harrisburg : If the time ever comes when Republicans really regard Democrats , or Democrats regard Republicans , as enemies , then truly the processes of democracy will stop ? for these processes require as between the two great parties compromise and co-operation and respect . This conviction more than any other holds out the promise that Stevenson can be a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , but the national leader as well . He is the man who makes the nation over in his image , and makes it better by appealing to the best in the nation . He is the man , as Woodrow Wilson maintained , in whom " the voices of the nation unite in a single meaning . . . so that he can speak what no man else knows , the common meaning of the common voice . " It was Dwight Eisenhower 's contribution in three years to restore the Presidency to this role . And since the American people understood this role And endorse it , they will insist that their 35th President continues in the tradition of a man who is both within politics and beyond politics . His faith in reason endows Stevenson with this rare capacity . Few others possess it in America today . The true measure of Adlai Stevenson is not the man ' against the unattainable ideal of the Presidency , but the man against other men . By this measure Stevenson stands alone . " Of course I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , neither is anyone else ! "
