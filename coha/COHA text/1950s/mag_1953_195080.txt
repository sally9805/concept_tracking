And the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh . <P> - Deuteronomy 14:8 <P> When the government of Israel worked out a system of meat rationing , no one thought it odd to find pork on a restricted list reserved for diplomatic missions and Christian residents . Most Israeli Jews , whether orthodox in religion or not , prefer kosher meat to the traditionally forbidden flesh of pigs . As the food situation grew worse , however , the supplies of kosher meat ran low , and the government did not have the foreign exchange to import all it needed . Three months ago , in a desperate effort to maintain Israelis ' fortnightly meat ration , the government allocated some locally grown pork to a few nonkosher butcher shops in Haifa . <P> When rabbis throughout Israel protested , government pork sales were discontinued , but the administration of Socialist Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion insisted that there was nothing wrong with selling pork on the free market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel 's 30-odd pig farms began to sell their swine . Restaurant customers soon found their drab diet of cod fillets varied by the introduction of pork cutlets at $2.80 a portion , and housewives were able to purchase some nice cuts at $3.75 a lb . <P> The rabbinate was quick to denounce the booming sales of Judaism 's " abominable meat . " Last week Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog led religious Israelis through a week of protest . Jerusalem was posted with signs titled " Ye Who Defile , " which called both pig eaters and pig breeders " empty , godless people devoid of any respect for Israel or its values . " At mass meetings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , rabbis pronounced an adapted version of an ancient curse : " Accursed be he who raises pigs , his partners , helpers and assistants , and sevenfold curses on him who raises pigs in the Holy Land of Israel . " * <P> Although many normally observant Jews , driven by the meat shortage , were eating pork , most of them felt uneasy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Ben-Gurion 's party : " I do n't keep a kosher kitchen in my home , but to see Jews ordering pork chops in butchers ' shops licensed by the Jewish state hurts something deep inside of me . " <P> This week , the orthodox Agudat Israel Party has a bill before the Knesset , Israel 's parliament , to ban all sales of pork to Jews . Other Knesset members discussed importing more kosher meat on the free market ; they were confident that the sale of pork would then dwindle . <P> <P> *The original curse ( 1st Century B.C. ) included a malediction against " the man who teaches his son the sophistry of the Greeks .
