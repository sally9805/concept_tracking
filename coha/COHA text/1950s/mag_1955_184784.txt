When the millionth Volkswagen beetled off a West German assembly line this month , Volkswagen workers were treated to 40,000 liters of beer , a cancan act from Paris and a speech frowning on the 40-hour week . " Work is much more satisfying than idleness , " said Volkswagen President Heinz Nordhoff ( TIME , Feb. 15 , 1954 ) . " It is not without good reason that the cycle of six working days and one Sunday has been in existence for thousands of years . No doubt , a Saturday off would be a nice gift to many but a curse to others . Most people live only to escape themselves . For them , another weekday without work would only increase the emptiness and disconsolateness caused by idling away spare time . " <P> Most West German workers , who lost more than weekends during World War II , have been inclined until recently to agree with Nordhoff . " They did n't want leisure ; they wanted money to recoup their losses , " explained an official of D.G.B. , West Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , as German economic recovery has zoomed , labor 's drive to cut the work week ( from an average 48.7 hr. ) has gathered momentum . Last week West German miners voted to strike , if necessary , for an eventual 40-hour week . Other key unions , e.g. , steel and ironworkers , were expected to follow suit . Within five years , said D.G. Boss Walter Freitag , he hopes to convince employers throughout West Germany that weekends are wonderful indeed . <P> By that time , Saturday Toiler Nordhoff may have some new evidence on which to base his own view . Last week Volkswagen announced that it has bought an assembly plant at New Brunswick , N.J. , where Studebaker has turned out J47 turbojet engines . There , Volkswagen will assemble its rear-engine , four-cylinder cars for the U.S. market , where it already has 40% of all foreign-car sales ( 2,500 a month ) . In Jersey , Heinz Nordhoff is not likely to find many workers troubled by the emptiness and disconsolateness of a two-day weekend .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
