For two weeks Chancellor Konrad Adenauer remained silent about the strange case of Otto John ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) , though he knew full well the damage that had been done to the West and to public confidence in his own regime . Last week , speaking to his people by radio , he described John 's disappearance into the Soviet zone as " shocking , " but he insisted that the former West German security chief had no Western military secrets : " The damage he can cause is not so great as was thought at first . " Adenauer freely acknowledged the error in giving so unstable a man so crucial a responsibility : " That he was not suited for it is clear . " <P> <P> Next day , Adenauer 's government offered 500,000 marks ( $119,000 ) to anyone who would come forward in the next three months with facts that would ex plain the mystery of Dr. John 's strange exit . But though West German and U.S. intelligence officers still profess to be in doubt whether Dr. John defected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hardened into the almost unanimous belief that he defected . <P> Within days after John 's journey into East Berlin , he made three convincing radio broadcasts , wrote several personal letters , and appeared in a photograph which showed him apparently enjoying life in an open-air caf on Stalinallee ( see cut ) . <P> More and more , it looked not like well-planned betrayal ( he left behind papers which would have been invaluable to the Communists ) but like a case of impetuous defection at the height of an emotional jag . John had been hitting the bottle , and telling friends of his concern over what he regarded as the return to power in West Germany of former Nazis . He disappeared immediately after attending the morbid anniversary observance of the July 20 , 1944 attempt on Hitler 's life ( his own brother was executed in the bloody aftermath of that unsuccessful plot ) . <P> His fear of a Nazi revival was the explanation John himself gave over the Communist radio , and it was a handsome propaganda gift to the Reds . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason at home , for another abroad . Extreme rightists and neo-Nazis in Germany crowed that Dr. John 's defection proved that Germany could not trust any German who resisted Hitler during the war . Replied Adenauer : " Those who , out of love , for the German people , tried to destroy the tyranny are worthy of the highest honor . " Abroad , Adenauer knew that talk of resurging German Naziism was sure to strengthen the opponents of EDC in France . Said Konrad Adenauer : " I expressly declare that there is no revival of National Socialism in Germany , and that it will not revive . "
