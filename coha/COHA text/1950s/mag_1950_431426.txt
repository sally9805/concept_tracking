 | It was a wildly exciting moment . I waited , demurely . Waited to hear those miraculously nonsensical things that a man finds to say to the girl to whom he is proposing marriage . Waited for the stumbling phrases of endearment that are such an important part of this most important part of a girl 's life . He assumed the proper demeanor ; he looked deep into my eyes . And when he began to speak , there was a new and husky quality to his voice . The impassioned words tumbled out : " Darling , you 're so normal . " That was my proposal , and three months later I became the wife of a psychiatrist . I think it pertinent to add that immediately after we were married he set me straight on that romantically impulsive statement . He did n't mean completely normal ; he really meant just normally neurotically normal . Even my most enlightened friends seemed a bit alarmed at the thought of my marrying a man of this profession . They were convinced that I would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly as he read the morning paper ; that my every gesture , word , and movement would give away some nameless and dreadful side of my nature , lurking under deep layers of my unconscious . Never again could I safely pluck absent-mindedly at a worrisome hangnail , scratch at an imagined mosquito bite , or curl a lock of @#  | hair around my finger while reading . My life would be an open case history . It was also taken for granted that forevermore my head would be buried in ten-volume works of scientific erudition ; magazines like Psychotherapy and the Psychoanalytic Quarterly would replace Harper 's Bazaar and Good Housekeeping on the coffee table . Even if I strove to remain aloof from the technical aspects of psychiatry , I would undoubtedly pick up enough knowledge of the inner workings of the human mind to be a complete menace to the civilized society of my carefree , happily mixed-up friends . The fact that they were all enchanted by my charming , fun-loving , attractive husband-to-be was completely beside the point . I was a doomed soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not once on our honeymoon did I catch him reading my mind . The morning after we were married , I turned cagily to him with a leading statement : " Darling , I had the most wonderful dream last night . " He yawned and said , " Did you ? " He did n't even want to interpret my dreams . That settled it . My friends were crazy . ( I have learned to use that word advisedly . ) As the weeks went by , I found myself getting used to being married to a psychiatrist who acted just like a normal man . There was only one thing that disturbed me ? his conversation . He would lead me into discussions of new movies , tennis matches , the quality of the art work in department-store ads , Evelyn Waugh , coeducational schools , out-oftown reviews of new plays , baseball scores , the Braque exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art , herb cookery , cream chocolates versus hard centers , Mrs. Roosevelt , hot music , and Milton Berle . Notice the total absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to brood about it . MAYBE he thought I was stupid , or that be bored to hear about his " day at the office . " The last thing I wanted was a frustrated husband , so I started drifting over to the bookcase in the evenings after dinner ( while he stretched out on the divan with Time or The New Yorker ) , more and more intrigued by His Shelves , which were filled with a truly prodigious collection of psychiatric books . At first I limited my impulse to a close inspection of the titles and bindings . I began to envision how proud of me he would be if I could discuss his work with him . How wonderful , I thought dreamily , to drop a conversational bomb someday by offhandedly mentioning that my Oedipus hurt and was that psychosomatic ? I was fascinated by the idea . So I began to read , furtively , like a school student in study hall who tucks a comic book behind his Latin textbook . My course was short-lived , however . I must have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . He took one horrified glance at Volume I of The Collected Papers in my hands , leaped across the room to me , and irreverently hurled a good ten pounds of Sigmund Freud toward the kitchenette , muttering darkly all the while . Rumpled and stern , he turned to me . " Do n't ever let me see you doing that again , " he said . " I married you because you do n't have a mind ! " I 've steered clear of His Shelves ever since ; instead , I 've become a perfect treasure-trove of information on batting averages in the National League . There was only one time , again shortly after our marriage , that I had a really terrifying feeling I was living with some kind of super-mind-reader-voodoo expert . One morning I approached Jim to ask permission to buy a new dress . This idea met with his complete approval , and he promptly gave me a blank check . When I mentioned that I was dying to go to Hattie Carnegie 's ( enough to make even the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely cautioned me to be " sensible . " SUFFICIENTLY armed with the blank check and a magnificent feeling of well-being , I sallied forth into that elegant establishment . Well , I did buy a dress . It was beautiful and not too extravagant . But just as I was leaving the shop , it happened : I saw a suit that had to be mine . Ten minutes later , in an almost hypnotic state , I found myself going home with it in a box under my arm , along with the knowledge that the original purchase was at that very minute being torn in a frenzy of alteration . By mid-afternoon I was suffering from shooting pangs of conscience . How could I do such a thing to my sweet , generous husband ? Two creations from Carnegie , a wicked dent in our checkbook , and that poor man not suspecting that he 'd married a gold digger . All afternoon I struggled with the Voice inside me , knowing that I had to tell him and that the time was approaching rapidly . Wearing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at his office . He was darling . He said I looked beautiful , he was happy , proud of me for my good taste . All in all , he made me even more miserable and ashamed of myself . He took me to a wonderful French restaurant ( I should have existed on bread and beans for at least a month ) , and still I put off the Confession . Instead , I regaled him with not very funny stories , bits and pieces of inane gossip about people he 'd never heard of , and in desperation repeated , verbatim , Mother 's favorite recipe for chocolate brownies . I talked a blue streak , telling him everything I could think of except that I had bought another dress he did n't even know about . It was all so very ludicrous ? after all , he might not divorce me ? maybe I 'd get off this time with twenty lashes . I brightened a little at that thought . Halfway through dinner , the necessity of breathing forced me to stop my wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling psychiatrist smiled gently at me , leaned forward intimately , and asked , " What 's the other dress like ? " That 's all . A simple , calm question . Just simple and calm enough to make the hair rise on the back of my neck . How could he have known ? Did psychiatrists really have a sixth sense ? Were my friends ' silly misconceptions now to be justified ? Faced with my utter bewilderment and stricken expression , he patiently explained , with a mind functioning like that of any other husband , " For weeks you 've been talking about wanting an off-the-shoulder dress ? and what you 've got on is n't it . " Telepathy ? Psychoanalytic insight ? Metaphysics ? All poppycock . It was nothing more than everyday man-logic . There are times when I worry about him and his work . By the very nature of it , he is involved sometimes with psychotic ( really crazy ) patients , and in such cases there is always an element of physical danger for a psychiatrist . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions it and when he does , passes it off as lightly as possible . I remember one day when I was seriously concerned about him ; early in the afternoon he went to a private sanitarium where one of his patients was hospitalized , and I spent the rest of the day watching the clock and listening for his return . Jim had told me that this particular case was difficult , and apparently the patient was suffering from a towering persecution complex . The man was convinced that his prescribed duty was to fight Communism in the world and that his ordained role in life was to wipe out any Communist he could lay hands on . The terrifying part was that nothing could shake his belief that Jim was a militant Red , with a direct line to Stalin , plotting the overthrow of the government . He represented a real threat of physical violence . Finally , Jim returned from the hospital visit ; he announced in a good-natured but haggard voice , " I 'm making progress at last ; he 's changed his mind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks I 'm a Republican I almost wish there were something glamorously different in the behavior of my psychiatrist husband . It saddens me a little to report that , like your husband , he bellows about shirts that come back from the laundry minus buttons ; he lets his perfectly adequate temper fly now and then ; he 's no more than mediumneat around the house ; and I never have been able to get the Sunday paper back in sequence after he 's torn into it . He actively frets about his hairline and has a completely unreasoning loathing for applesauce and Brussels sprouts , although admittedly he has never , to his knowledge , tasted either . HE IS not too secretly convinced that it 's a man 's world and the male automatically knows more about anything than the female . I 'm willing to go along with that theory , with one exception . Three weeks ago he came home about seven o'clock and kissed me ardently . Then he took a stance squarely in the middle of the living room , straightened his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the labratory had called him at the office and asked him to stop by on the way home . He faltered a bit at that point , ran a hand through his hair , and nervously cleared his throat . " Darling , " he said , " I think you should know ? I mean there 's every reason to believe ? " There was honestto-goodness unanalyzed sweat breaking out on his forehead . " The fact is , we 're going to have a baby ! " I tried to look as absolutely stunned as I could . I 've never asked him and he 's never explained how he thought the specimen got to the laboratory to be tested .
