The Navy claimed a big record last week . Although the figures were secret , the carefully worded announcement said that at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert , the Douglas Skyrocket ( D558-2 ) had " attained the highest speed and altitude ever recorded by a piloted plane . " <P> The little ( 4O-ft. ) white Skyrocket had waited a long time for its day of glory . Built as a Navy experimental ship , it made its first take-off from Muroc 's long , dry lake bed almost three years ago . Even then it could crack through the sonic barrier , but for a supersonic research ship , its performance was unspectacular . The stubby little rocket-powered Bell X-1 had already been dropped from the belly of a B29 , and had carried its pilot close to twice the speed of sound ( TIME , April 1 , 1949 ) . By comparison the newer Skyrocket dawdled . <P> Early Handicap . But the Skyrocket had started its career with a handicap . Unlike the X-1 , it was designed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine was crammed into the narrow needle-nosed fuselage . There were rocket motors too , for speed runs , but they gulped fuel at a ton a minute from tanks cut down to accommodate the powerful turbojet and its accessories . Rocket thrust was never available to the pilot long enough for the plane to approach top speed . <P> Late in 1949 the Navy decided that its research plane had loafed long enough , and had collected all the data it could at the lower limits of supersonic flight . Then the Skyrocket went back to the shop . Its turbojet was removed , the air intakes ( not needed for rocket propulsion ) were covered over , and the 40-ft. fuselage was fitted with extra tanks that doubled its capacity for the volatile rocket fuels . <P> Last month , like its predecessor , the X-1 , the Skyrocket was hooked up into the enlarged bomb-bay of a 6-29 and hauled 35,000 feet into the cold , thin air over the Mojave . Test Pilot Bill Bridgeman was gunning for an altitude where the outside air temperature is 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's blood boil ; though the little plane 's cockpit was pressurized and air-conditioned , Bridgeman wore a specially designed pressure-suit with a helmet like a deep-sea diver 's . A tiny windshield wiper cleared the face plate of the condensed moisture from his breath . <P> Long Glide Home . Cut loose from the bomber , Bridgeman switched on his rocket motors , climbed quickly to the test altitude ( about 12 miles ) . Then he pushed over into level flight . The tiny ( 25-ft. spread ) , sharply swept wings , the sleek fuselage that carries its rakish tail surfaces high above the wing wake , met little resistance from the rarefied atmosphere . For three thundering minutes the Skyrocket boomed along . Before its rocket fuel ran dry it was probably screaming through empty upper air at 1,500 m.p.h. or more . Power gone , it glided in lazy spirals back to its base at Muroc , far down in the desert heat .
