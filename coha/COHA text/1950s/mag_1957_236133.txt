From under the white sands along the Persian Gulf two new oil wells gushed up 4,400 bbl. a day last week . The twin strike , in the Wafra field of the 50-mile-square Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , meant more than just a new source of oil . For Wafra , it pushed output above 50,000 bbl. a day and increased estimated reserves to more than 5 billion bbl . For a tall , stoop-shouldered American named Jean Paul Getty , it was a multimillion-dollar payoff on a daring gamble . <P> Getty Oil Co. , which is 82% owned by Getty and which controls a $1.5 billion oil-and-tanker empire , bought a 50% interest in the Neutral Zone eight years ago , when it had yet to produce a drop of oil . Today Getty holds one of the most important stakes in Middle Eastern oil , where he is the only U.S. individual producer among the giant corporations . Says Getty : " I own my companies . How many others do ? There are just a few left like me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as busy building tankers as he is drilling wells . For Tidewater Oil , which is also controlled by Getty , he has embarked on a $250 million program to build supertankers to carry Getty Co. oil from the Neutral Zone to its major markets in Western Europe , Japan and the U.S. Last weekend the 53,000-ton S.S. Tidewater slipped down the ways at Saint-Nazaire , France . It was the ninth new tanker for Tidewater since 1954 and the second in the past month . Sixteen more are on order at cut-rate French and Japanese shipyards . The total tonnage for all 25 will be 1,234,530 d.w.t . For his flagship , Getty is now dickering to build a 130,000-tonner in France . Said Getty : " My competitors have been burdened with small tankers . I am determined to obsolete their fleets by building no tanker less than 46,500 tons . " <P> Sugar Candy . Oilman Getty , 64 , is one of the least known among the world 's oil giants , usually breaks into the press only with news of his marriages and divorces ( five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel rooms from Europe to the Levant , has little social life , usually eats alone and frugally , wears out-at-the-elbow sweaters . A notorious penny pincher , he passes out tips sparingly , constantly grumbles about the high cost of everything from restaurant food to taxi fares . But he freely pays thousands for such hobbies as his private art museum ( Rubens , Titian , Gainsborough , and perhaps the best U.S. collection of Louis XV and XVI furniture ) and the zoo ( four buffalo , two bears , an Abyssinian mountain goat ) , adjoining the Malibu home he has not visited in five years . <P> Getty 's everyday pleasures are munching maple sugar candy and talking over big-wheeler deals in English , French , Arabic , German , Spanish or Italian . He has plenty to talk about . Besides his $300 million interest in Getty Oil , he controls 64% of Tidewater Oil* ( $460 million worth ) , 59% of Skelly Oil ( worth $335 million ) . He also has .417% of the Iranian Oil Consortium ( worth about $8,000,000 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of real estate from Acapulco to Manhattan 's plush Hotel Pierre .
