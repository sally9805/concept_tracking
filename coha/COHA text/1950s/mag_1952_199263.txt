WAGES &; SALARIES <P> The Wage Stabilization Board , which ordered a nationwide wage freeze a year ago , last week got around to making the order stick . In Detroit , a regional WSB enforcement commission found the J. D. Hedin Construction Co. guilty of paying $40,000 in over-the-ceiling wages , the first such major decision since the freeze . It found that Hedin 's bricklayers got $3 an hour for working on a Veterans Administration hospital when WSB regulations allowed only $2.75 . The commission ruled that Hedin must pay federal income taxes on the $40,000 , and ordered the VA to deduct the sum from its contract with Hedin . WSB is investigating 267 other companies in New York and New Jersey suspected of paying wages above the legal ceiling .
