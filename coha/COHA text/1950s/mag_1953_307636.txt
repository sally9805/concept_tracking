At a dinner party at Washington 's elegant 1925 F Street Club one evening last week , Mrs. Karl Mundt was seated next to Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield . He asked after Senator Mundt , who was attending a night session of the Senate . Mrs. Mundt said the Senator ( up for election next year ) was downcast because of the Oahe Dam . Summerfield politely asked about the dam , and Mrs. Mundt rattled off the facts &; figures . A $14 million appropriation for the South Dakota dam had been dropped from the 1954 budget , she told Summerfield , and it was a pity . After all , $16 million had already been expended on the dam , and to cancel the project now would amount to an awful waste . Summerfield promised to help . Afterward , he sent a strategic note to " the right hands " and $8,250,000 of the appropriation was restored . <P> Not every appropriation was so charmingly and successfully lobbied through . When the Army Civil Functions Appropriations , commonly known as the pork barrel , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bygone pork barrels . The bill provided $412,391,600 for dams , bridges , other engineering projects dear to the hearts of Congressmen . With wondrous forbearance , the Representatives resisted the pressures and blandishments of lobbyists and constituents , bravely cut $86,250,000 from the already trimmed-down Eisenhower budget . It was $171,675,000 less than last year 's pork appropriation . Congressional thrift touched off speculation about the pending foreign aid bill . If Congress is niggardly with funds for the Missouri River , Capitol observers asked , what will happen to appropriations for the Rhone ? <P> Last week the House also : <P> Voted unanimously to grant permanent U.S. residence to Polish Flyer Franciszek Jarecki , who liberated a MIG and himself in Denmark ( TIME , May 11 ) . <P> Received from its Ways &; Means Committee a bill to extend the maximum bonding period on whisky from eight to twelve years . <P> Appropriated $1,974,171,570 for the Departments of Labor and Health , Education and Welfare . <P> The Senate : <P> Approved the President 's Reorganization Plan No. 2 to renovate the Agriculture Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , to July 1 , 1955 <P> Repealed the " use it or lose it " leave law , and restored the right of Government workers to accumulate up to 60 days ' annual leave . At the same time the bill prohibits 500 of the topmost Government officials from collecting cash settlements for unused vacations.
