Ever since the Suez crisis of 1956 threatened much of the free world 's oil reserves , prospectors have been coming to Canada in droves and pushing out to the unlikeliest corners . Last week Northern Affairs Minister Alvin Hamilton told the House of Commons about the newest " hunting ground : Canada 's forbidding Arctic . So far this year , no fewer than ten companies and individuals have applied for the right to explore 60 million acres of coastal waters and arctic island territory north of the Canadian mainland. * <P> The government will do everything it can to hurry along approval of the applications and speed the prospectors on their way . In the master plan for developing the Arctic , oil may well be a lure that brings roads and towns and facilities of every description . The government itself touched off the race for applications with recently completed geological maps showing formations of an oil-bearing type extending through the Arctic as far as Ellesmere Island , 490 miles from the North Pole .

Equally visionary was Deputy Minister Gordon Robertson 's suggestion to build an ocean pipeline from Ellesmere Island to Europe-a shorter distance , he pointed out , than Interprovincial pipeline spans between Edmonton and Toronto . Said Robertson : " It would be the wildest folly and the grossest arrogance to say that these things will not , in due course , be quite possible . The ' Far North ' is far from us , but it is close to the center of the modern world . " <P> <P> * Among them : Dominion Explorers Ltd. , Round Valley Oil Co . Ltd. , W. R. Newman ( Joseph H.
