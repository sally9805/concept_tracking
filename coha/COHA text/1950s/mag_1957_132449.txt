The spartan legions of Michigan State invaded Ann Arbor last Saturday with all the ferocity of the ancient conquerors of Doris and Laconia . They struck quickly and powerfully . When it was over , the defending forces of the University of Michigan , which had been ranked sixth in the nation by the Associated Press poll , lay smitten 35-6 , their worst beating in 22 years . Michigan State thus established itself as the only football power to be spoken of in the same breath with Oklahoma . // There was glory in football , too , last weekend , and a 19-year-old lad from Poughkeepsie , N.Y . received a lion 's share of it . He was Montfort Stickles , who made the Army-Notre Dame game the most exciting of the season by kicking a 28-yard field goal with six minutes to go to give Notre Dame a nerve-pricking 23-21 victory . // The kick was the climactic moment for the 95,000 frenzied spectators in Philadelphia 's Municipal Stadium . They had been on tiptoe since the beginning of the fourth period when Notre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had missed the vital try for the extra point which would have tied the score at 21-21 , and he had missed it at point-blank range . // His miracle from 28 yards out  --  and miracle it was , for he had never before attempted a field goal  --  was too much for taut nerves . Pandemonium broke loose . After the pandemonium the miracle was explained by Stickles : // " What happened was this , " he said . " We took a time-out . It was fourth down and we had about eight to go for the first . I was resting and Bronk Nagurski  --  I think it was Bronk  --  came into the game . He comes up to me and he says , ' Coach says kick a field goal . ' He gave me the kicking tee , then he says , ' Coach says keep your head down . ' I did n't feel nervous or anything , even after missing the third conversion  --  the one that would have tied the score . I was just overconfident on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams sets it up nice and fast and I boot it . The angle was good and the ball just made the right side of the crossbar by about three or four feet . Thing that bothered me was I did n't think those goal posts were wide enough . No kidding , looked real narrow . Somebody goofed. " // Stickles , a bull-like 6-foot 4-inch , 220 pounder , held his head back and pressed a handkerchief to his nose . He talked to the ceiling . " Caught an elbow . Wo n't stop bleeding . " // Presently he lowered his gaze . // " It 's a funny thing , me kicking that field goal . First place , I never kicked one before . Second place , it was that boot that beat Army and I almost went to West Point . Yep , Coach Blaik had me up there several times looking the place over . I wanted to go there , too . I grew up about 20 miles away and I always liked the Point . They would n't take me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , they said . Well , I guess I could see pretty good today , huh ? " // His father , Montfort Sr. , stalked in . They shook hands . " When I saw you were going to try the field goal , " he said , " I said to your mother , he 's going to be a hero or a bum . " // He smiled , turned to the other players and said : // " Know what his mother did ? She pulled out her beads and started saying the Rosary . Me , I held onto the rail so tight I must have dented the bar . " // Aubrey Lewis , Notre Dame 's first-string halfback , had been left behind at South Bend with an injured ankle . He showed up in the locker room Saturday morning with a big grin on his face . " Hi , coach , " he said to flabbergasted Terry Brennan . " Mind if I suit up ? " He had paid his own fare . " I got to thinking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't miss it and I wanted to suit up . I had to put on someone else 's jersey ; they did n't even bring mine . " // He was all smiles in the jubilant Irish dressing room after the game , just as thrilled with the victory as if he had taken a personal part in it . // " Oh , you should have seen Brennan when Monty kicked that ball , " cried Lewis . " He took that hat of his and tried to pull it over his ears . Then comes the big grin . The big , big grin and when you see that guy smile like that you know you won the game . // " We wanted to win this one , " said Lewis , " but the one we really want is Oklahoma . We 're gon na stop them , too . We can do it , you 'll see . " // The team physician , Dr. George Green , was , if anything , more thrilled with the Irish victory than the players . // Dr. Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame fullback . The sportswriters covering the game had just voted Nick the Grantland Rice award as the game 's most valuable player for scoring two touchdowns . His second , a 65-yard run , provided the lift that put the Irish back in the ball game when Army led 21-7 and seemed to have them in a hopeless hole . // " The first 50 yards , I felt good , " Pietrosante said , grinning . " Then , all of a sudden , I was out of gas and looking for the end zone . Was I glad to get home ! " // Mechanically , resolutely and a bit tiredly , Blaik made his terse comment : // " If you do n't have the depth , " he sighed , " you do n't have the depth . " // That was a point more than amply proved by Michigan State in its lopsided victory over Michigan . Coach Duffy Daugherty of MSU fielded a fine first team . It was quick . It was big and strong . It was resourceful when the still fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half . It was intelligently run by Quarterback Jim Ninowski . It had a standout runner with tremendous speed and drive in Halfback Walt Kowalczyk , who might have looked even better if his teammates had not all been of such a very high standard themselves . But in the early part of the game , Michigan had moments when it seemed to have about the same qualities  --  plus an almost exactly similar version of the multiple offense. // The difference in the teams became apparent when the substitutes appeared . In the case of Michigan State the difference between the first and second  --  and even third  --  units was scarcely visible , particularly as Michigan began to wilt under such an overwhelming power in both numbers and ability . Nowhere else in college football except at Oklahoma does this same strength in depth exist . // CAMERAS , PLAYERS HIT THEIR STRIDE // ONE BY LAND : The athletes who execute the plays and the photographers who arrest them on film were in top form for football 's fourth week . Here both cooperate to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear path for Iowa Halfback Bill Gravel ( 14 ) on 11-yard touchdown run against Indiana . The Iowa ends ( 88 and 89 ) and tackle ( 77 ) are moving down to take out the two halfbacks who are the only Hoosiers in position to stop the touchdown . Iowa won 47-7. // ONE BY AIR : Oklahoma ( in white ) , a team that usually can spot a phony a mile away , got fooled this time . When Texas faked a run for the goal in the first quarter ( bottom left of photo ) it worked so well that Walt Fondron ( 24 ) , Longhorn quarterback found two receivers in the clear . He tossed to End Monte Lee ( 86 ) for the game 's first score . Oklahoma won 21-7. // SLIPPERY : Tailback Don Long of UCLA feints a tackier out of position with the kind of motion that inspired the term " swivel hips . " On this one-yard TD dash Long outran Washington 's Dave Enslow ( 65 ) , scoring team 's first score in 19-0 victory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Kansas , shows in this pass play the intricacies of balanced-line single wing . Guards ( 62 and 63 ) pull out , but instead of leading interference with blocking back ( center ) they protect passer , Dwight Nichols ( 16 ) , who takes handoff from Tailback Terry Ingram ( 17 ) . Ends and wingback ( bottom ) start down field to receive .
