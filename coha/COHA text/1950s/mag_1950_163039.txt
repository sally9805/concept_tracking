Nothing-literally nothing-had been left untouched by 50 years of progress . New York on Jan. 1 , 1900 had been innocently delighted with the snowflakes ( the kind " that wear well " ) ; but by the Christmas season of 1949 , improvements had been made even in this department . Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center designed its own snowflakes : they were of plastic , 19 inches in diameter , held by a pin to a 10-foot pipe . <P> When the wind blew , they spun . Explained a spokesman for the Center : " We hoped they 'd spin , but aerodynamically I 'm surprised that they do . " He added : " It 's not the greatest substitute in the world for the real thing , but it 's so hard to keep real snow around here . " Men were assigned to go about inspecting the pins and tightening them up so that the winter wind would not rattle the snowflakes . In an older lore , the care of snowflakes had been entrusted only to the nicest angels ; the Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the province of the carpenter . " <P> Thus another job had been de-skilled by the American genius for organization . <P> What Would He Do ? It was easy to laugh at such antics of the mid-century American ; he did a good deal of laughing at himself , knowing that he had come far in a hurry and was somewhat ludicrously unsure of where he was or where he was going . Munching a chocolate bar , drinking a Coca-Cola , the American bestrode the narrow world ; what he would do next was a prime question in the minds of men everywhere . <P> Could he , for example , keep up his amazing industrial progress ? A few months before the half-century ended , that question was answered with an emphatic yes in an Atlantic Monthly article by Harvard Economist Sumner H. Slichter ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) . <P> To estimate how much the U.S. might be able to produce in 1980 , Slichter started with four reasonable assumptions : <P> 1 ) the population would be 175 million ; 2 ) the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 3 ) the average amount a worker produces in an hour will continue to rise , at the 2%-per-year rate as it has for several generations ; 4 ) the average work week will be cut by onefourth . Most important of these assumptions is No. 3 . If more and better machinery , and more and better industrial organization continues to raise productivity at the old rate , 1980 's worker will be able to turn out 88.4% more in an hour than the worker of 1948 . <P> On the basis of his four assumptions ( adjusted by some other considerations ) , Slichter suggests that " by 1980 the output of goods and services of the American economy , which was $246.7 billion in 1948 , will be at least $416 billion ( in terms of present prices ) and that it is more likely to be considerably larger-probably in excess of $550 billion a year . " <P> Slichter thinks that the old 2% rate of annual productivity increase might be jacked up to 3% . Then the U.S. could produce 70% more goods in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 years . Slichter says : " One is fairly safe in predicting that the U.S. will gradually become a country of two car families " and " millions of family size swimming pools may be installed .
