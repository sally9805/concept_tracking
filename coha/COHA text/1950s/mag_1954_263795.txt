" When a cooking pot begins to stink , it 's time to put the lid on . " That was the advice the influential Tokyo Shimbun recently flung at Premier Shigeru Yoshida , 75 . A government corruption scandal of Teapot Dome proportions threatened to overturn Yoshida 's conservative coalition government . Everyone wondered whether shrewd , durable Premier Yoshida would be able to meet this challenge . <P> The stink began to rise three months ago when a Korean confidence man named Masutomi Ito was arrested for bilking thousands of small investors of some $3,000,000 in an investment-trust racket . Swindler Ito spent part of his plunder on such delicacies as broiled eels in Tokyo and an expensive mistress in Kyoto . He admitted that he had continued to solicit funds even after his investment company had gone bankrupt , blandly told police : " If this constitutes fraud , I 'm afraid there 's nothing I can do about it . " <P> Geisha Galas . As investigators looked deeper into Ito 's financial shenanigans , they found a trail that led , indirectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo moneylender whom police linked to Ito 's financial operations said that these were small compared to the way subsidized shipbuilders used government money to bribe officials for more subsidies . The moneylender backed up his story with a list of wild geisha parties thrown by shipbuilders and subcontractors for government officials , including seven members of Yoshida 's Cabinet . Altogether , 600 geishas were involved in the parties . Soon 100 suspects , among them 59 company heads and directors and five Diet members , ended up in Tokyo 's Kosuge prison accused of either giving or taking bribes . Streets outside Kosuge were filled with secretaries and geishas bearing gifts of chocolates , bean-paste cakes , silk pillows and $60 cashmere underwear for the prisoners . <P> Clamor for Yoshida 's resignation increased . His left-wing opposition in the Diet , though divided within itself , is bigger than his own coalition . The left-wingers were hot &; heavy after Yoshida for his pro-Western policy , and used the scandals as their club . Haughtily refusing either to discuss the scandals or to give police the help they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Diet , calmly warmed his feet over a charcoal brazier at his private villa in Oiso , 42 miles from Tokyo . His own Liberal and Progressive supporters realized that if they tried to desert him , he could dissolve the Diet and call for elections . The Liberals and Progressives well knew that an election would mean heavy losses for them . <P> 20 Votes . Last week , with confidence that the time was ripe to topple the " old fox , " the Socialists offered a motion of " no confidence " in the Diet . In 65 years , no Japanese Premier had ever survived a similar motion . <P> As the Diet convened to decide Yoshida 's fate , members hurled angry insults across the chamber and demonstrators showered spectators and legislators with Yoshida-must-go leaflets . Through it all , Yoshida sat impassively , twirling his silver-headed cane . When the votes came , he won , 228 to 208.
