This is how three U.S. citizens in far lands caught the spirit of the Christmastide last week : <P> Before the last star has faded on the horizon , on every day , seven days a week , Alex Johnson , 60 , a husky ( 212 lb. ) , balding man from Miami , gets up , pulls on his khaki working clothes , leaves his stilt-legged house at the Tha Pra livestock station in the depressed northeastern sector of Thailand . Tha Pra , a corrugated plateau where the soil is poor and the people poorer , is a bumpy , 300-mile , two-day journey from Bangkok . It is also the worst place in the region to conduct agricultural experiments , but Alex Johnson , longtime teacher of vocational education , who retired as Bade County superintendent of schools in 1952 , asked for a challenging assignment when he offered his services to the U.S. Point Four program . " I decided , " says Johnson , " to come out to a foreign land to do some good for other people . " Stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thailand in March 1955 , with his wife Elsie took over as livestock adviser . <P> In his 3 years in Tha Pra , Alex Johnson has introduced the country 's first silage system , taught sanitation , farm management , building construction and irrigation , brought high-yield corn ( 50 bu. per acre ) from Indonesia , improved pasture and foliage , showed his charges how to use commercial fertilizer , planted grain and sweet sorghum , introduced the Velvet bean and the cowpea ( for soil improvement ) . In his own acre-plus garden he demonstrated to once dubious Thailanders that pineapples and bananas can be grown well in poor soil , even cultivated tomatoes , collards , okra , eggplant , yellow squash , sweet corn and lettuce . <P> On Christmas Eve the Johnsons will set tables on the lawn and be hosts to about 100 local farmers , village headmen and their families . There will be plenty of curry , hot dogs , ham and soft drinks , as well as native reed-pipe music , color slides and movies . Next day , precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bamboo baskets , buffalo and cattle bells , even blow guns-Alex and Elsie Johnson will sit down to Christmas dinner . And back home in Miami it will be midnight on Christmas Eve . <P> In Banmethuot , South Viet Nam , high on a virgin plateau 150 miles northeast of Saigon , tribesmen from the surrounding jungle villages and refugees from Communist-run North Viet Nam are learning modern farming techniques from 60-year-old New Yorker John Barwick and a dozen young ( 23-26 ) men from U.S. farm families . Barwick and his wife Laura worked in foreign countries ( in the Middle East with Arab refugees , in Europe with prisoners of war ) for 15 years before going to Viet Nam for the International Voluntary Service two years ago . <P> Grateful Vietnamese farmers refer to fatherly , pipe-smoking John Barwick as Ong Cu Da ( roughly , " Team Chief " ) , have showered the Americans with honors . From mountain villagers , for whom they demonstrated well-digging techniques , the teachers received-and all proudly wear-copper bracelets.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
