( See Cover ) When the Soviet Lunik raced past the moon and free of the earth last week , it did more than win a triumph for its designers . It also marked a turning point in the multibillion-year history of the solar system . One of the sun 's planets had at last evolved a living creature that could break the chains of its home gravitational field . <P> After a few more moments on the evolutionary time scale , earth 's restless social primate , man , can almost surely make himself felt throughout the system . Earth 's life will no longer be confined to the earth . This startling development took place with explosive suddenness . Boys still in high school remember a time when sensible citizens considered space flight as impractical as hunting leprechauns . Only ten years ago the altitude record for rockets , 250 miles , was held a brilliant achievement . Only two years ago , the earth satellite , that humblest of space vehicles , seemed an almost impossible project . <P> Newton 's Rails . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chinese , who invented rockets about 1200 , did not theorize about them , but Sir Isaac Newton 's laws of motion , published in 1687 , not only explained the principle that makes rockets fly but gave the essential sailing directions for space ships of the future . When a U.S. Atlas or an even bigger ( for the present ) Soviet space rocket roars into the sky . it runs on rails devised by the ill-tempered Sir Isaac , who sat in his English garden nearly 300 years ago and wondered why things move as they do , and why things fall . When a rocket engine shoots a jet of gas out of its tail cone , Newton 's third law takes over : For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . Acting in the opposite direction to that of the racing gases , a mighty force lifts the rocket off its launching pad . As long as the engine fires , the rocket climbs faster and faster , obeying Newton 's second law : An unbalanced force acting on a body makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the engine burns out , the rocket continues upward under the control of Newton 's first law : . . . A body in motion continues to move at constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force . As it rises , it slows and curves because an unbalanced force , the earth 's gravitation , keeps pulling at it in obedience to Newton 's law of gravity : Each particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them . <P> Although the magic laws of Newton pointed clearly into the sky , no one apparently followed their lead until a shy , deaf , self-educated Russian schoolteacher , got to thinking about air travel in the 1890s . Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky , born in 1857 , wrote about space flight with amazing prescience . He chose the rocket as the only possible space engine and derived mathematically the speed that its exhaust gases would have to attain . He decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1898 , when not even an airplane had left the ground .
