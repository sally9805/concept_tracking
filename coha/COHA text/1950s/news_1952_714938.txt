txt Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower stood on the lovely south- portico of Thomas Jefferson 's Virginia capitol tonight and said in effect that he would be mighty proud to have Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia support the Republican ticket on Election Day . The Republican nominee , completing a 6,885-mile trip in which he made eighty-four speeches and in which he urged the South to abandon its one-party allegiance , told an enthusiastic crowd of 25 , - 000 that Senator Byrd was a better representative of Jeffersonian principles than was the present Administration in Washington . The General had fair words not only for Senator Byrd but for Jefferson Davis , Robert E. Lee , James Madison , Jeb Stuart . Stonewall Jackson , Patrick Henry , George Mason , Pickett , Olmstead , and , of course , Mr. Jefferson . " The New Deal , " he said , " is going in the opposite direction from Jeffersonian principles terrifying . ly fast . Through the Brannan plan , it would like to control agriculture ? something that was abhorrent to Jefferson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Senator Byrd . " It would seem that the party of Jefferson has a more nearly accurdte heir here in Virginia in the person of your senior Senator , Byrd , than it does in Washington . He certainly believes in frugality and thrift  --  words that I doubt are in the Washington dictionary . " Earlier , in Petersburg , Va. , the general was even more elaborate in his praise of the Virginia Senator , who is a leader of the economy bloc in Congress and a longtime opponent of many of the **25;276;TOOLONG policies . " I must say , " the general told a crowd of 12,000 in Petersburg , " that any party that can produce a man like Harry S. Byrd seems to rne to be a top-flight sort of ( ) MM . As a matter of fact not long ago I remember reading a crack that we have too many Byrds ! in Congress . Well , I disagree ; I would like some more like this . " Byrd Still Uncommitted Senator Byrd , who fought against an attempt to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party at the Democratic convention , has not said whether he would support Gov . Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois , the Democratic Presidential nominee . Accordingly , the general 's tributes to Senator Byrd in both Petersburg and Richmond were regarded as an attempt to win his support in the election on Nov. - 4 . The Republican nominee said at Petersburg that Senator Byrd believed " in the things that we believe in . " " He believes in integrity in government , in thrift , in economy , " the general continued . " He believes in the virtues that have made America great . " The general asked why he should // have anything except " the greatest admiration and respect for Senator Byrd just because he was in the opposite party . " And then , just to make the tribute complete . in the eyes of his audience on the Richmond capital lawn , the general added : " I respect any man who believes in Americanism like I respect Robert E. Lee . " ? general Eisenhower ended his twelve-day trip tonight . on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greeted not only by immense crowds , but with an enthusiasm that had been matched nowhere in the Middle West or the border states , with the possible exception of - his tumultuous welcome in the tivin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis on Sept. 16 . ? In Richmond the general said that the Fair Deal had abandoned ' Jeffersonian principles and he added that he was sure that if Jefferson were alive today he would vote against the . New Deal and the Fair Deal in the next election . The general was scarcely able to complete a : single paragraph or idea without being drowned out by applause from the crowd spread out below him on the Capitol lawn . And when he attacked the present Administration it broke out with a cry , " We want Ike . We want Ike . " He was so confident  --  or so weary ? by the time he reached the old capital of the Confederacy here this evening that he delivered his eighty-fourth speech of the journey to an immense throng without any prepared text . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might be able to carry Virginia . In the 1948 Presidential election the Democrats - carried North Carolina by 200,498 but they Look Virginia by only 28,716 . The States Rights ' vote in Virginia four yearshowever , was 43 , - 393 and in North Carolina . it was 69,652 . Everywhere he went today ? as in his first trip into the South at the beginning of this month ? he was not only met by large crowds but applauded more enthusiastically than anywhere in the West and the North . At one stop he said he was " amazed " by the reception he was getting . Stands Filled to Capacity At Salisbury , N. C. , this morning , where his train stopped to take on water , a crowd of several hundred gathered before 7 o'clock and began shouting " We want Ike and Mamie . " First the general got up and went out in robe and pajamas . Then Mrs. Eisenhower did likewise , to the obvious pleasure of at least one Southern gentleman who shouted ; " Hey Mamie , you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Charlotte , and Winston-Salem , N. C .. and Roanoke , Lynchburg , Petersburg and Richmond , Va. , and was greeted with the same friendliness and good humor . At 8:30 in the morning at Charlotte , a crowd estimated by police at 25,000 crowded the main street from the station to the Memorial Stadium to watch him go by . When he reached the stadium through this throng , the horseshoeshaped stands were filled to their capacity of 18,000 , and another 2,000 were jammed around the upper rim . There was nothing the population did not do to show him their enthusiasm . The Republican nominee improvised much more today than when he had campaigned in Georgia , Florida and Alabama on Sept. 2-3 . He talked everywhere from notes , reverting to some of the themes ' he developed on that trip . He said at Charlotte , for example , that when he returned to this country from Europe in June his political advisers told him not to go into the South . The reason given for this advice , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he would be wasting his time . The general remarked that when he was nominated for the Presidency he promised that he would treat all areas of the country alike and that he would conduct his campaign in accordance with the principle that each area , each state , each community was not owned by anybody except the people who lived there . " I 'm quite sure , " the general said . warmed by the obvious pleasure of the capacity throng , " that if some of those people who feel that they have held those mortgages in Washington could see this crowd this morning , they would begin to look at this paper and see if someone had canceled out the debt . " The general then called on the roaring crowds to cancel out forever the Democrats ' " political mortgage " on the South . The general then attacked the Administration for its " failure " to halt inflation , for being lax in its treatment of subversive elements in the Federal Government , for its " scandals " and for trying to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various communities . Levels Fire at Bureaucrats He said " more and more bureaucrats seem to think they know how to run our business . They want to tell the farmer what he should plant , when he should plant it , how he should rotate it , how much he should plant . They want to ease into everything . They even want a bureaucrat now to ' take over responsibility for the health of each of us . " At Winston-Salem , the general was introduced by the Republican nominee- for Governor , Herbert Seawell , in the following words : " The Lord has provided us with a great day in North Carolina . We are on the road to a two-party system in the South . I present to you the foremost citizen of the world  --  likable , lovable Ike Eisenhower. : " Here a ' crowd estimated at 9,000 spread out in a wide open space in front of the railroad station , many of them students of Salem College , which he took occasion to praise as the oldest school and college for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these young women , the Republican nominee said : " My associates and I are engaged in a crusade , a crusade that is firmly based in ideals , in purposes that we ' think reflect the highest of moral standards . In ' such a crusade , the concern of women for that kind of value is important to us . Men , in their daily preoccupations of earning , a living , are apt , far more than women , to become obsessed with the material values , to measure everything by such standards . " Women never forget that the moral tone of the whole is the basis of our civilization . As a consequence , they carry that kind of crusading spirit even into a political campaign . Indeed , I should say they instinctively carry it into a political campaign and we need exactly that at this moment . " Now , this crusade , ladies and gentlemen , is first for integrity in government . And integrity in government is not just a word . Integrity in government means bringing into the Federal Government by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointed channels  --  the finest men and women of whatever race , color or creed this country affords , bringing in people who are so incorruptible themselves that we do not have to spend our time constantly searching for crookedness and venality in government . They will not get there because they wo n't allow them to . get there . " This reference to men and women of every race , creed and color was the only one the general made in his first five- talks today to the race question . He avoided this controversial subject even more than on his first Southery . trip . At Roanoke , where about 7,000 covered a. football field to hear him , he said , " You people and I , I imagine , would disagree on many subjects that are political and economic if we started to di-lcuss them , but at least we ce.1 be together in the fundamentals of honesty , fairness , justice and things that have made America what it is today . " When the campaign special drew up into the middle of Lynchburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tracks , was jammed from . . building to building for the length of an entire block . J. Hillyer Boyce , the Chief of Police , - estimated the crowd at 12,000 . The general was scheduled to arrive in New York at 9:30 o'clock tomorrow morning . He will leave again on an extended trip to the West Coast and Texas on Tuesday . The general 's ' headquarters at the Hotel Commodore in New York said he would devote most of the week-end to rest and preparing speeches for his next trip .
