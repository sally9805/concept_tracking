In California 's mountain-bordered Central Valley , a green , 450-mile finger veined by rivers and stretching half the length of the state , nothing buzzes quite so persistently as the Bees . Last week the industrious hum of the three Bee papers ( combined circulation 284,755 ) , issuing from hives in Sacramento , Fresno and Modesto , rose louder than ever . For the first time in its 102 years of publication , the Sacramento Bee came out with a Sunday edition . <P> To 150,050 readers , the new Sunday paper was an unexpected treat . Long accustomed to dull makeup and stodgy writing , they raised eyebrows at the generous use of color , white space , and sprightly features in the 174-page edition . " We have n't been able to featurize our papers much over the years , " said Managing Editor Myron Depew . " Now maybe on the weekend we can entertain our readers , maybe charm them a little . " <P> Guided by a Codicil . The Sunday Sacramento Bee had another purpose : to meet the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently pushed brisk Sunday circulation sorties into a jealously guarded newspaper preserve . To the custodian of the preserve-which also includes five radio stations and a television station-such poaching is intolerable . Valley residents seem to feel about the same way . In the 18,000-sq. - mi. domain , one of every two doorsteps is daily crossed by a Bee ; in Sacramento so many people take the paper that a new carrier boy is handed a route list , not of subscribers , but of those few nonconformists who do not subscribe . <P> Custodian of the Bees is a 61-year-old spinster so shy that none of her papers have ever printed her picture . " Newspaper people should stay on the sidelines , " says Eleanor McClatchy , president of McClatchy Newspapers since the death in 1936 of her father , C. K. ( for Charles Kenny ) McClatchy , who took over the Sacramento Bee in 1883 on the death of his father , James McClatchy . Eleanor McClatchy 's guide is a codicil to her father 's will : " I want the McClatchy newspapers ... to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> " It 's Scary . " Times have changed since the days when C.K . helped sweep California government free of railroad domination and armed his reporters to cover the Ku Klux Klan . But the Bees hum every bit as independently now as then . C.K . leaped party lines to endorse Warren Harding in 1920 and old Bob La Follette in 1924 . Although Eleanor has been more consistently Democratic at the national level , she makes endorsements on the state ticket with an impartial disregard for party . Last fall she supported Democrat Pat Brown for Governor , but the rest of the Bees ' state ballot went to Republicans . Bee readers expect thorough news coverage as a matter of course . The Sacramento Bee , biggest of the three , maintains a city-room staff of 70 , and keeps a full-time squad of six newsmen on the state legislature beat . A string of 238 correspondents services all three papers . <P> Carrying on the family tradition , Eleanor McClatchy seems acutely aware that only the untimely death of her brother Carlos of pneumonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary , " she says , " when you think how much the people rely on us.
