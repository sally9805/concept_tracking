JOSEPH 'S , one of the 20 best teams in the nation , and it probably will happen again . Speed , experience , excellent shooting and great size are reasons why many coaches consider St. Joe 's tops in the East . Coach Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarke , Forwards Vince Kempton , 6 feet 8 , and Jack Egan , and Guards Joe Gallo and all-East Bobby McNeill . Tall Forwards Frank Majewski , Joe Reilly and John Hoffacker load the front line ; lack of veteran reserve guards is the team 's only possible weakness . At LA SALLE wily Coach Dudey Moore is priming his squad for the big upset . One of the most notorious pessimists in a profession famed for its blues singers , Moore is making almost-cheerful sounds this year . If he had the one good , really big man so essential these days , LaSalle would be a threat to anyone , because all five starters are back after a year of the best coaching to be found anywhere except Kentucky , Temple and California , where it is merely just as good . The veterans , of fair average size , are Bob Herdelin , Hugh Brolly and Bob Alden up front and Guards Ralph Bantivoglio and Joey Heyer , the last the league 's third-best scorer . Three sophomores , Joe Carey , Bob McAteer and George Friedrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak , LAFAYETTE , too , is unusually fortunate in the number of returning starters in camp . Forward Charlie Ross , top scorer in the MAC , and three other first-team veterans make the Leopards genuine title contenders . Guards Jim Hurst and Pete Pavia and Forward Morris Boyer will start again . Coach George Davidson 's big problem is at center , where he will test 6-foot-10 George Hoerrner . Two poised sophs , a fine rebounder named Chip Lundy and speedy Bob Kauffman , could beat out veterans and start . TEMPLE is recovering from a rough season but should move up substantially , with three starters back and a strong sophomore crew . The Owls have a brilliant guard in Bill Kennedy , who will team with Bruce Drysdale , and experienced forwards in Bernie Ivens and George Palmer . Sophomore Russ Gordon probably will start at center ; he is 6 feet 4 and the squad 's tallest . Reserves Norm Ginsberg and Stodie Watts and sophs Earl Proctor , John Koskinen , Mike Gold and Ed Devery complete the roster . BUCKNELL has a courtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsets but equally sure to trip over their own inexperience . Coach Ben Kribbs lost all but Guard Tommy Thompson . Dave Evans and sophomores Don Lampus and Joe Steiner average nearly 6 feet 5 across the front line , are backed by veteran Bruce Babich and soph Mike Fadden . Reserves Pete Matz and Mike Kasnick return at guard , with transfer Larry Roman and sophomores Doug Hill and Kevin Cooney . MUHLENBERG had big plans until 6-foot-6 Forward Dick Sekunda was put on academic probation , leaving only Don Robins and Joe Berghold as returning starters . Coach Birney Crum has some reserve height in Herb Loeffler and Ron Druckenmiller , while a tall soph named Dick Hunt is a likely starter at center . Other top newcomers are Chris Hiotis and Jack Superka , and Joel Sarner and George Gilfillan are back from the 1959 reserves . RUTGERS got off to a slow start last year , but has enough experience now to avert a repetition . Karol Strelecki , Doug Patton and Bill Barton are returning regulars , and plenty of depth is furnished by Lars Steensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flock of good sophomores . DELAWARE will have a strong first five , fast and tough on the boards , but a weak bench . Tom Adams , Chuck Hamilton and Gil Mahla will start again , with soph Tom Schonauer joining them . The fifth man should come from 1959 reserves Jack Baly , Jay Lynch or Al Wentz . GETTYSBURG is the only MAC team without a single returning starter . Reserves John Warner , Bill Fitzkee , Bill Hemsing , John Bauer and Ken Kamis , plus likely soph starters Bob Parker , Ron Warner and George Burnett , are the nucleus of a squad with good speed but no height or experience . LEHIGH has good over-all size in starters Ross Culligan , Terry Eckert and Jack Palfi , plus promising sophs John Jacobsen and Norm Brandl . They should improve on last year 's record , but not much because there is little talent in reserve .
