Curling , a peculiar sport that had its beginnings in Scotland around 1500 , is a winter version of the English game of bowling on the green . It also has shuffleboard overtones . Last week , for the first time , curling 's native Scotland was invaded by a group of curlers from the U.S. , where there are an estimated 4,000 confirmed addicts concentrated mainly in enthusiastic clubs around New England and the upper Middle West . <P> In its purebred Scottish form , the game is played on a 46-yd. strip of ice , usually on an indoor rink where the ice is more even and not subject to sudden thaws . At each end of the rink there are fixed bull's-eye targets ( see diagram ) . Each player on a four-man team , captained by an authoritarian " skip , " gets two shots at the target on each round . With a bowler 's arm-swinging motion , the curler hoists a 40-lb. circular ( maximum circumference : 36 in. ) stone , * and sends it slithering down the ice toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of the " hog line , " it is automatically removed from the rink ; if it slides beyond the scoring line , it is also out . Object of the game : to nudge an opponent 's stone out of the scoring circle while leaving your own near the center . Highest possible score in an " end " ( inning ) , comparable in its rarity to a no hitter in baseball : 8-0 , where all your stones are in the circle , all the opponent 's stones are farther out . <P> Canny Strategy . At the Crossmyloof rink at Glasgow last week , none of the five Scottish teams scored such a shutout , but they did manage to whip the Americans in the first test match , 109-54 . In the second match , the U.S. did better , only lost 94-83 . The Scotsmen played a camay , conservative game , in sharp contrast to the generally slam-bang U.S. style . The Scots used blockade tactics in front of the scoring circle until the skip , comparable to cleanup batter in baseball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' into the bull's-eye . <P> At the Glasgow bonspiel , one U.S. " rink " ( team ) , skipped by Frank Van Epps of Portage , Wis. , salvaged U.S. prestige by winning , 24-12 . Van Epps produced the shot of the day . Two Scots stones , placed about a foot apart , guarded the scoring circle . While Van Epps lined up his shot , Detroit Lawyer John Ritter McKinlay acted as temporary skip to give Van Epps the proper strategy . <P> The other two teammates stood at mid-ice , brooms in hand , ready to " soop " ( sweep ) away any real or imagined particles of dirt or ice that might impede the progress of Van Epp 's stone . <P> Brush Now ! Standing at the " hack , " Van Epps swung his stone " elbow in , " imparting a clockwise twist to the handle . Up the ice it came in a smooth , shallow curve . " Do n't brush ! " shouted McKinlay . Just before the stone came to the hog line , McKinlay yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their household-type brooms ( the Scotsmen use T-shaped brooms , rub rather than sweep the ice ) . The stone slipped on between the two trotting sweepers , snicked the two guard stones away and came to rest plunk in the center . <P> " That 's the way to play the game , " shouted McKinlay to his grinning skip . The Scot skip was less demonstrative . Soberly he raised his broom , the curler 's signal for a well-played shot . <P>
