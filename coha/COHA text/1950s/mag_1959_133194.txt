Of the many facets of college football by far the most satisfying is its blithe unpredictability . Some Invincible U. invariably gets itself tied up in knots that a Houdini could not unravel , and many are the Threadbare Techs which can not possibly excel , but do . The game has never been guilty of a suffocating adherence to form ; suspense and mystery are seldom absent . // This season was no exception . It did not lack , of course , its share of nonmysterious successes and failures . Eyebrows were not raised over the triumphs which ushered Louisiana State and Mississippi into the Sugar Bowl , which won laurels for Texas and Texas Christian , which assured Wisconsin a ticket to the Rose Bowl . Syracuse , the No. 1 team in the land , had considerably more class than many expected , but it had just been to the Orange Bowl and was earmarked a winner from the outset . // The stunning surprises  --  the Arthur S. Flemmings that popped up in the cranberry bogs of college football , 1959  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arkansas ; and Seattle , Washington , and saddened them at West Point ; Columbus , Ohio ; Dallas , Texas ; and Norman , Oklahoma . // These seven were not , to be sure , the only major shockers of the season . Every week had its upsets . Tennessee twice rose above mediocrity to end the long victory strings of Auburn and LSU . Notre Dame 's spirited finish caught Iowa and Southern California with their confidences up and their moleskins down . Were the season two weeks longer , Illinois or Michigan State might be representing the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl . And were it two months longer , highly ballyhooed North Carolina , ending with an unexpected rout of Duke , 50-0 , might have lived up to its press notices . But on balance , the most astonishing reversals of September 's promised form were those analyzed below after a national survey of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED 'S football correspondents . // PEACE , IT 'S WONDERFUL . With Georgia 's Bulldogs , it was the little things , beginning last spring , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Don Soberdash vowed there would be head knocking if anyone returned overweight in the fall . Nobody did . Back from Alabama was Line Coach J. B. ( Ears ) Whitworth to serve as a perfect counterbalance for the tough , tongue-lashing Coach Wally Butts . Whitworth bent his understanding ears to players ' problems and helped cement the team 's exceptional unity . In the aura of peace and good feeling , the sharp Bulldog quarterbacks , Charley Britt and Francis Tarkenton , got over their resentment of one another . They evoked marvels of effort from the thin back-field , while Guard Pat Dye anchored a deep and dependable line . When Georgia , 10th in the Southeastern Conference last year , trimmed the terrible Auburn Tigers , the country finally took notice of a team that had only to lose a little weight and gain a little fellowship to win the SEC title . // END OF AN ERA . The recruiting game in college football has gotten so rough that even Bud Wilkinson is feeling the pinch . It is obvious from a glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft of Texas prospects as well as plucking home-state plums . But where are the Leon Heaths and Tommy McDonalds and Eddie Crowders of yesteryear ? The hard truth is that enough big ones have gotten away to cut the Sooners down to dimensions average opponents can cope with . Wilkinson saw it all coming , but he had cried " Wolf " so often before that it took the defeats by Northwestern , Texas and Nebraska and the narrow escape from Kansas to convince anyone of the truth . The Sooners had a variety of ills besides an unaccustomed lack of depth : too much slipshod tackling , not enough sure ball handling , a tendency to bungle elementary matters of judgment . But make no mistake about it . The days of riding roughshod every weekend are gone forever . // THE WALKING WOUNDED . At West Point , football is regarded as the closest academic approximation of war . If casualties are the criterion , the academy was never more successful in simulating actual battle conditions . Coach Dale Hall inherited the nucleus of a marvelous team ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the first shot was fired , the wounded poured in . Preseason injuries all but eliminated the No. 1 fullback , John Eielson , and the starting tackles , Bill Yost and Jerry Clements . Bob Anderson , the All-America left halfback , was hurt in the second game ; Steve Waldrop , the right half , in the third . Lonely End Bill Carpenter suffered a shoulder separation in the seventh game . Down to the end , Army displayed boundless courage , but it was a thoroughly hobbled mule that made its way wearily home from its worst defeat by Navy . // COACH ON FIRE . Nobody quite realized just what Coach Frank Broyles ' flaming spirit could do for the Arkansas Razorbacks . He took a small but fast line and a light but speedy backfield , juiced them up with his own competitive spark and sent them cutting hog-wild through the Southwest Conference . Under the spell of Broyles ' silver tongue , the team hit harder than any other in the conference . Wayne Harris , at only 190 pounds , suddenly became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the effects of chronic off-season headaches and became Arkansas ' best running back ever ; Lance Alworth emerged as a triple-threat terror beyond all expectations . You 'll hear a lot more about Broyles . Ex-aide to Georgia Tech 's Bobby Dodd , he is young ( 34 ) , thorough and smart , above all else a quick-thinking tactician under the stress of battle . // FAILURE IN THE STAR SYSTEM . Southern Methodist 's dismaying season taught a noteworthy lesson : a school which klieg-lights an exceptional player does so at its peril . The object of SMU 's illumination was the superb passer Don Meredith . Largely because of him , but also because of other touted assets , SMU made everybody 's preseason list of best teams . The point is not that Meredith failed . He was a phenomenal passer . Rather , the team failed Meredith . The Mustangs were listless and surprisingly sloppy . Jealousy of Meredith 's SMU-primed publicity ( but not of Meredith personally ) was clearly one of the causes . " Aw , it ca n't help but make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wider-awake Mustang could have meant a great difference in Dallas . // FLATTENED OPTIMIST . Behind the sudden fall of Ohio State is a sad discovery for Woody Hayes and other positive thinkers . There are no pushovers any more . By the standards of past years Ohio State beef would have been sufficient for the season . Nobody was surer of this than Hayes . " We 'll win the title , " he flatly predicted in September , before he learned that the patsies of earlier days had grown into uncooperative young giants , no longer submissive to the likes of Hayes and the Buckeyes. // Even had Hayes 's best quarterbacks , Jerry Fields and Tom Matte , and his big All-America fullback , Bob White , not suffered limiting injuries , he would have been sweating , for the Big Ten had struck its best balance in years . An early-season flutter at wide-open football was as futile as Hayes 's bedrock ground-it-out game ; Ohio State collapsed to its worst record ( 3-5-1 ) since grim 1947. // IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST . Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they lost no fewer than seven games , they were a team , too . There were no All-Americas at Seattle in 1958 ; there are none now . What most people failed to notice before was that Washington lost many of its games by close scores . What practically everybody was conscious of this year was that Washington was led by a one-eyed quarterback , Bob Schloredt , who got into the leading traces when First-stringer Bob Hivner was hurt . Schloredt , deprived of the sight of his left eye by a boyhood Fourth of July accident , provided just enough offensive punch to assure that teamwork and that elusive commodity , " heart , " would finally bring a Rose Bowl trip to the earnest forces of Jim Owens . Owens never tried to teach showy tactics beyond the Huskies ' fairly limited physical capabilities .
