PART THREE It was after my third year at Grinnell College in Iowa that I discovered that I was twenty-three years old , and nothing done yet . Nothing done ! It was time to get going , I decided , before the world passed me by . To return for a final year of college seemed a waste of time . The previous year dad had resigned from the Montana State Supreme Court and re  --  turned to private practice . He had also taken an active leadership in the state Republican Party , and I had helped him by drawing po  --  litical cartoons for several Montana newspa  --  pers . The cartoons had been well received , en  --  couraging me to hope that I could make good as a professional . The question was : Were my Mrs. Charles H. Cooper , who lives in Hollywood , calls on her son in Holmby Hills , Calif . " Looking at mother nowadays , " says Cary , " it is difficult to believe I once saw her swinging an ax at 20 below zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as I thought they were ? I had to find out . In the fall of 192 ? t , dad and mother were in California , where dad was trying to untangle an estate case for a Montana client . He wrote me that since he might be stuck in San Diego and Los Angeles for months , it would he a good idea for me to ease down that way and let mother see how her , mowing boy was doing . I eased on down . In the back of my mind was the idea that some Lns Angeles newspaper could use a good cartoonist like me . Los Angeles editors did n't seem to think so . The cartoonists they had were young , eager and unwilling to retire . The best I could get was a job in a newspaper advertising depart  --  ment drawing up display ads , to sell on com  --  mission , if I could . The ad manager gave me a list of merchants , patent-medicine manufac  --  turers , tattoo artists and others who had never advertised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a new field to myself . " All you have to do , " he said , " is design an ad so attractive that your client ca n't resist buying it . When your ad doubles his business , hell want inure , and your commissions will mount up . You make him rich , and lie makes you rich , and the town prospers and grows as a result . We expect a population of a million here , you know , and we 're letting you in on the ground floor . " He was so right . But something was wrong  --  either my sales talk or my display ads . No sales , no commissions . Six weeks Liter , I had another sure thing . A photographer saw that while the population of California was being swelled by immigration from Iowa and other points , there was also remarkable activity in the production of native sons and daughters . - We ca n't lose , " he gloated . " The whole world can change , but the pride of a mother in her baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Intimate portraits of your own child in your own home . ' It 's sure-fire . Take this album of samples and start punching doorbells . As soon as you 've made a few appointments for me , the mothers will pass the word around amongst themselves . Why , this thing can snowball until all you do is answer the phone and take orders . And we split fifty-fifty ! " No sales . We split fifty-fifty of nothing . Three weeks later , I became a theatrical scene painter , and in a ( Continued on Page 50 ) unique field . I apprenticed myself to a hack-drop artist who was a master of bold coloring . In his youth he had done some striking pastel work on the mirrors behind bars , but with the cooling of Prohibition he had gone in for vaudeville and burlesque-theater curtains . You may remember them being lowered between acts . One corner might advertise Schmidt 's Butcher shop , and include an appetizing painting of a sliced ham . Hank 's Friendly Tonsorial Parlor might be dramatized in the nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you could usually count on some enterprising mer  --  chant to take a panel advertising a two  --  pair-or-pants suit for 517.50 . When business was good , we could crowd as many as twenty ad panels to a curtain . The odd thong was that I no sooner en  --  tered this field than it folded all user the country . I try to make myself belicse it was already on the way out . A few years later , when I became enough of a figure in the movies to rate interviews with the press , the writers viewed this phase of my life with tears in their eyes : Broke , starving to death , a failure . How wonderful of you , Mr. Cooper , to rise above such circumstances . Yup . sure was . t think my starvation diet at the time ran to less than a dozen eggs a day , a couple loaves of bread , a platter of bacon , a few quarts of milk , and Just enough pork chops between meals to keep me going until l could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any deficiencies in my diet . I never bothered to deny any of the wild stories my poserty , nor the wilder ones that were to follow , but as long as I am telling my side of the story , you might as well have it straight . In December of 1924 I was a tall , vig  --  orous , reasonably well-educated kid who was trying out his wings vs hile Its mg high on the hog at home . Far from being a failure , I had n't even started . I had my pride on certain points , of course . Having worked my way through college . I in  --  sisted upon paying my own way with no financial help from dad . On the other hand , my pride saw no objection to a little free board and room , and the use of my mother 's flatiron to keep my pants pressed . The shortage of cash , however , kept me worried . I had saved up about 5400 . It had been my hope to add to this sum by picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to finance a profes  --  sional an course in Chicago . What I had not counted on was the reverse twist In  --  stead of my jobs financing me , I 'd had to ' inane ' : my jobs . So now , on a fine December day in 1924 , as I walked down Hollywood Boulevard toward nowhere in particular . I was down to that essential starting place for all actors . I was broke . Near Vine Street I saw coming toward me a couple of sorry-looking cowboys . They were beat up . They looked as though they had raced a stampede and lost , but seeing me they brightened up . " Boy , howdy , " said one . " If it is n't Slim ! " " You sure look gaunt , Utah , " said the other , " Could it be , my friend , that you are not eating regular ' ! " It was plain that they were speaking to me . But it was n't a panhandle job ; the voices were familiar . I looked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes and the cowboy hats that would never be the same again . Yeah . I knew ' cm . Jimmy Galen and Jimmy Cal  --  loway . Boyhood friends from Montana . Lawyers ' sons , same as me . They could write home for more money than I could . I remember that we pawed one another for a time , and pedestrians seeing me in my **29;592;TOOLONG suit thought I was being attacked by Kansas jayhawkers . We got that official greeting over and slid into a convenient hash house . Then it came out that they had found what amounted to a gold mine . " You re  --  member Slim Talbot ? " asked Galen , remembered Slim Talbot well . He was one of my boyhood heroes . We used to follow the progress of our favorite rodeo stars with the same worshipful admiration kids now give to baseball and football heroes , and Slim , though only a few years older than I was , was one of the best . tic had been born Jay Talbot on a ranch about twenty miles northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could walk , And how he could ride ! He was winning rodeo contests from grown men before he was sixteen , and by the time he was eighteen he was one of the best riders , ropers and bulldoggcrs al the West . He had an easy style . When a horse left the ground pitchmg , twisting and sunfishing , Slim just seemed to loaf around up there waiting for the beast to land . When it did , he was right there . firm in the saddle . In bulldogging a rampaging steer he did n't pounce from his saddle over the tossing horns . He would swoop in almost gently , cuddle an armful of horns , and then swing his long legs from the saddle as though the steer were helping him dis  --  mount . The crash as 1500 pounds of beef hit the dirt was always a surprise . It did n't seem that Slim had done a thing . The steer must have tripped , Slim showed the same remarkable co  --  ordination in riding ans thing that walked , rolled or flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he Just approached his flying machine as he would a horse , and took off , After the war he added barnstorming to rodeoing , making a sure thing out of either side of the corral . At county fairs or rodeos Slim would pick up nice fees for his aerial exhibition and passenger hopping , and then fly off with most of the rodeo prize money too . I wondered what had brought him to Hollywood . Galen enlightened me. - When the ro  --  deo Jimmy and I were traveling with went broke , we wrote to Slim , figuring he would know what was going on if any  --  body would . He told us about this racket , and here we arc . It 's a cinch . Instead of getting paid for sticking on horses , we get paid for falling off . Instead of wres  --  tling steers , we get paid for letting stern wrestle us . And when we drive a stage  --  coach , we get paid for tipping it over . What a snap ! " By this time I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to pick up the check . I was busy spooning in the chili , and only vaguely heard Calloway say , " And all we got ta do , Slim , is do this in front of a cumen ? When she rips , fall off and let her go . Ten bucks a day , and if you bust a leg , they pay for it . " I paused in my spooning , suddenly alert and suspicious . " You guys are n't  --  you would n't be  --  movie actors ? " I smiled as I said it . To us Montana boys , " actors " was a lighting word , The suggestion horrified them . All they did was ride horses past cameras and shoot a few blanks . I was not completely reassured . All of us had some favorite Western movie actors  --  William S. Hart , Hoot Gibson , Tom Mix  --  who could do no wrong , but the rest of the Hollywood cowboys ware held in contempt by us Western boys , They stuck in the saddle , we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are n't movie actors , " I asked bluntly , " then what are you ? " " Cowboy estras , " they announced proudly , " at ten bucks a day . " There arc arguments , and there arc arguments but you ca n't beat ten bucks a day . And as Galen was saying , " Get it straight , Slim , they got their own guys who wear lipstick , powder their faces and put mascara iCantinueil 0,1 Page 521 ( Continued from Page $0 ) ' around their eyes " ? we all suspended our eating to be revolted for a moment ? " but we do n't have to do that " Not until the meal was over did they inform me that with luck on my side , I still had a long way to go . " You got ta realize , " I was told , " that with snap jobs like these floating around , there 's a lotta guys after ' em . We get ten bucks a day . sure , but when you start out you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get that . Now we 've got some pull and Slim Talbot knows a real live director , and he 's got more . Come on , lees find Slim . " The gossip exchange for cowboy extras was down along Poverty Row where the quickie films were made , and we found Slim there , taking in everything and say  --  ing very little . We greeted each other with a couple of pokes that hung me on a barbed-wire fence , and then Slim allowed that he had picked up a couple of hot tips . " Now do n't get yore blood to bilin ' . " he advised , " hut thar 's a studio over the hill yonder that 's got a thing called The Vanishing American . Richard Dix is the boy that wears the tail feathers in that one , and they 'll need a lot of riders . Might get as much as a week 's work oulta it . They tell me three o'clock is a good time to mosey ' round . " While we were hanging around the lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Montana drawl that is as much a part of him as his cowboy boots . " Them air shows , they been peterin ' out pretty much here lately ; and rodeoin ' , I do n't know what 's come over it , but it ai n't like it used to be . So with nothin ' much to do , I took to goin ' to movies . What with all them Western movies and them war pic  --  tures , it struck me there was more wild West and more flying circuses in Holly  --  wood than anywhere else in the world , so I come out . Turns out like it was a good move . " Slim had been close to becoming cow  --  boy champion of America when the ro  --  deos went into a temporary decline , and he had enough prize money left to own a new Model T Ford . So we rode over Cahuenga Pass to the studio that after  --  noon in high style . At three o'clock we lined up before a casting director , along with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous as a bandaged thumb  --  the only one there who was n't wearing cowboy clothes . The director hired a few , and then came to Slim . He was about to put Slim 's name down when he saw mc , and stopped with his pencil in mid-air . I do n't remein  --  bcr what his crack was , but it had some  --  thing to do with dudes . Galen , Calloway and Talbot came to my defense . Was it my fault that I owned a suit of clothes ? Could n't the greatest rider Montana ever produced wear a necktie now and then ? By the time they got through with my build-up , they had invented a new breed of superhorses that only I could ride . " O.K. , O.K. , " agreed the casting di  --  rector . " If he 's that good , I 'll take the guy in the ten-dollar suit . The rest of you can go home , if you 've got a home . " And that 's the way it was . My friends had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had done themselves out . I was protesting the unfairness of the whole deal when they stopped me short . " Shut up , durn you . The more friends we got workin ' around , the more jobs they can scare up for us . Congratulations , boy ! You 're in the movies now . " 1 did n't take it in right away . Being in the movies was quite a jump for a boy who 'd grown up on a Montana ranch . Actually , it was a case of one thing lead  --  ing to another . I was in because I 'd drifted into Los Angeles to see my folks , and accidentally met up with cowboy friends , and because away back I 'd learned to ride . You might say I was in the movies because dad had mixed up some ranching with his lawyering . The only mystery in this chain of be-causes is why dad bought the Seven-Bar  --  Nine in the first place . In later years , he claimed he got the ranch to give my brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer vacations . Maybe so . But dad had been raised on a tiny farm in England , and he got a boot out of owning a spread bounded on the cast by the Missouri River , and on the west by the Rocky Mountains . We were just a wide spot in the Mis  --  souri gorge , about sixty miles north of Helena , where the Missouri had carved a big loop for itself . Across the river , the Big Belt Mountains went straight up into the sky . On our side was a half-moon apron of flat , rich bottom land nearly a mile long and about half a mile across the widest part . A branch of the Northern Pacific Rail  --  road ran through the gorge , and trainmen would pick us up or let us off on signal , and even hang around for a while to load cattle . Along with the outright ownership of the bottom land went grazing rights to thousands of acres on the mountain slopes . Nobody could crowd us . There was n't a place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first the ranch was just what dad bought it for , a hobby for him and a place in which to turn his boys loose in the summer . He stocked it with some scrub cows , a few mean horses and a meaner bull . He put a manager in charge , and hired some Indians to put up meadow hay during the summer , In some years it hardly lost any money at all . During the three years that mother and Arthur and I were in England . dad started taking the ranch seriously . He enlarged the herd with a better grade of heifers. and invested in a couple of Texas He did no have to pay . The court ruled that the $2o1 a month was " a free gift of a friendly , well-to-do group who wished their old minister to live without fear of want . " It was Hereford bulls . By the time we returned to Montana in the summer of 1913 , he had the place fixed up with a comfortable ranch house , a nice cottage for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and newfangled haying equipment . His herd stood at about 400 head , with maybe a couple hundred more running wild up around the timberline . It was my job each summer to round up these wild ones and drive them down to rich pasture in the bottom land . When World War I came along , we lost all our help in a few weeks . The Indians up around the ranch held a big powwow , with . tom-toms , war paint and feathers . The young braves who had been forced to listen to old men 's tales of tak  --  ing scalps . now had their chance to go on the warpath , and they did n't wait for a second invitation . I remember going down to the station to see my brother , Arthur , off to war . It was a bitter disappointment for mc . Just because 1 was sixteen and Arthur was six years older , he could go off with all those whooping cowboys and Indians . while I had to stay behind . He was silent now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tears started , and then the train was gone . My mother dabbed at her eyes and said briskly , " Well , son , now it is up to us . " That was all . Our English relatives had been in the ( Continued on Paste 56 ) not paid for services rendered , the court continued , but was a volun  --  tary " honorarium " which could be terminated at any time . lia , rd upon a 195-1 drrision . ( Continued from Pare 321 war for three years . Now Arthur was in to help them along , and there was work to be done , My mother and l left for the ranch the next day and dad returned to the state capital and his job of helping to keep Montana geared to the war effort . Looking at mother nowadays , a gra  --  cious , white-haired lady , it is difficult to believe that 1 once saw her swinging an ax at twenty below zero to break open bales of frozen hay . But she sure did . After each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded with hay through six-foot drifts , to keep the bawl  --  ing cows from starving to death . It was during the second winter that my mother said to me one day , " What 's come over you , Frank ? Every time you come into the dining room , you trip On the rug , and every time you sit down at the table , you spill the water pitcher . I 've ncscr seen you so awkward . " I apologized , but after that I kept no  --  ticing things wrong myself . When I threw a leg over the saddle . I 'd usually give the horse an accidental kick in the rump that could stir up a couple of jumps before I was ready . That bronc . Billy . was a mean one anyway . Most broncs want to throw you to get rid of you . Billy wanted to throw you so he could jump on you . Otherwise he was a good horse . Not until I bumped my head on the six  --  foot barn door did 1 kritiw what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As l'Ne remarked earlier , I did n't stop until I had grown thirteen inches in thirteen months . We turned out a lot of beef on the Seven-Bar-Nine during the war years , and were coming to believe that ranching was no more complicated than breeding cattle and selling off the increase when the market was high . We reckoned with  --  out the troubles peculiar to ranching . Well-behaved steers suddenly will begin kicking the daylights out of you at brand ? ing time . They will deliberately starve off tons of weight before they can be shipped . Some will drop dead for no reason at all . And you get weather . Montana has a warm wind called a chinook . One day in early spring , after a winter of heavy snows , a chinook flowed over the moun  --  tains . Almost overnight , it melted every foot of snow east of the Continental Divide . A wall of water came down the gorge , hesitated for a moment at a darn that supplied Helena with power , and then took out the dam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop around our ranch : it went right across us . All it did to the house was take off the porch , but all the outbuildings went . The hayfield was left covered with sand and gravel several feet deep . That fall we had no feed for the herd . Dad and i took about 400 head to Chicago . By the time we arrived , the price of beef on the hoof had fallen so it would n't hose paid the freight . Dad re  --  membered his winter in Wisconsin . where the farms had hay to burn the year round . We turned our cattle train around and dumped our herd into some feed opens near Madison , expecting that by spring the market would be high enough to take care of everything . The market did go up , but so did the cost of feed . By spring the price we got for the cattle just paid their board and room for the winter , and all we were stuck with was the freight bill . The next year is still remembered in Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and twenty-eight nights . Some say it was thirty-three days and nights , but they are counting the cloudbursts that came before the rain finally settled down to business , and after . This time the Missouri swept our ranch down to bedrock . Even if we had had a hay seed left , we would have had to use dynamite to plant it . We were n't exactly discouraged about our ranching . But by that time the art courses I had taken at Wesleyan and at Montana State College were beginning to stir up my ambition . My water colors were on the washed-out side , and my charcoal sketches were wobbly , but my desire to follow in the path of the West  --  ern artist Charles Russell was more in  --  tense than ever . I knew that one Russell painting of a roundup was worth more than the whole herd as beef . I also knew that I faced many years of study , with failure very possible in the end , before I could hope to be even an apprentice-type Russell . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the life of a rancher . I added up my credits from Wesleyan and Montana State College . and found I was a hona-fide high-school graduate . I decided to go East to college , and major in art . At the same time my brother . Arthur . was also thinking that something must pay better than ranching . With his college degree already in hand , he decided to take up banking . He has remained in banking and finance ever since , both in Montana and here in California . I ca n't say that either of us has ever regretted his decision . When I talk of going East to college . my wife accuses me of talking like Bob Hope . Grinnell College was founded by Josiah Grinnell , who settled in Iowa after a short talk with Horace Greeley . " Go West , young man , " Greeley thundered on this immortal occasion . " Go West ! " Josiah Grinnell thought he had discov  --  ered the West in ' Iowa and founded his town and college in 1853 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By that time Grinnell was a peaceful town of about 5000 , with most of the residents still abiding by Josiah 's original ruling that no purchaser of land in town could eser sell liquor there . The students at Grinnell College , about 600 in number , were not so conservative . I remember that during my first semes  --  ter I got a job working for a professor who was quite an applegrower . He was proud of the sweet cider he served at faculty get-togethers , and one of my chores was to go through his orchard and gather up the windfalls to run through his cider press . I cut him in for three gal  --  lons out of every four I pressed , reserving the " spillage " for a senior chemistry student in my dormitory who had a book explaining the process of distilling . When he followed the book the stuff was ter  --  rible. but once , guided by inspiration alone , he must have split a cider atom . I 'll never forget the impact of that apple  --  jack as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unexciting , During my first year my injured hip put a crimp in my sports career , and after that I was too busy keeping up with my studies to do much else , except draw sketches and cartoons for campus publications . I was n't a " loner " exactly , but I was older by three years than most of the kids in my classes . During the summer vacation I came out of my academic shell and really lived , The ranch was not yet recovered from the effects of its two floods , and dad , by this time a state-supreme-court judge , was too busy to restock it . So I got a job as a bus driver in Yellowstone Park . My bus was an open-air , ten-passenger job , on stiff springs . It was designed for the roads it had to cover , not the passengers , and the roads had been designed for mule trains . It had a ratchet shift and to change gears I had to synchronise the speed of the motor with the speed of the selected gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , the gear box would break up , a comforting thought if you tried to shift to low gear going downhill , and missed . The roads through Yellowstone in 1922 were spectacularly dangerous . On one stretch from Canyon Wall . elevation 10.000 feet , down to Mammoth . eleva  --  tion 5000 feet , I had passengers who did n't know whether they rode down or fell . In those days . dudes were n't sure whether bus drivers should be tipped or not , so I had to teach them . If I drove along carefully , missing the worst chuck holes , avoiding skids when roads were wet , and clinging to the inside walls on the cliff roads , my reward from a busload of tourists might be a pat on the head . But if I shouted warnings ? " Watch out , folks ! Here we go again ! " ? as crashed into holes , if I wrenched my back pulling out of skids , if I could get my back wheels spurting gravel over the edge of the cliff , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , this was my first attempt at acting , until the day in 1924 when Slim Talbot got me a job in the movies as a cowboy extra . I was probably the tallest , thinnest extra who ever swung into the saddle . Somehow , the cameras took a liking to me , and showed me on horseback to ad- I vantage . But the eye did n't sec what the I camera lens saw . My wrists were too long , my knees were too pointed , and my .1 shirt looked as though it was draped over a wire coat hanger . Leading ladies re- ; sented playing scenes with mc , complain  --  ing they had to stand on tiptoe and crane their necks to unladylike angles . To cope with the situation , I engaged an agent named Nan Collins , and asked her what I should do . She looked me over , sizing up my long neck , flapping elbows , pointed knees and the gap where my shirttail threatened to come out of my pants , " 1 think , Mr. Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything by changing your name . " I could n't see that . Hollywood had a bad habit of changing good honest family names to something theatrically flossy , and I wanted no part of it . Frank Cooper I had been born , and Frank Cooper I would remain . " But , Mr. Cooper , " Miss Collins pro  --  tested , " I like the Cooper part of it . It 's just that Frank  --  well , Frank is real cute , and I like it , but it just does n't do anything with Cooper . It does n't  --  well , thrill me . " " It does me , " I said firmly , For several weeks I stood fast for my own name . But now that I was sharply conscious of a name I had always taken for granted , I found Frank Coopers crop- .1 ping up everywhere , and lots of them up to no good . It seemed that every day a Frank Cooper was being sagged in San Francisco or arrested for rum-running in Miami . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep . Finally , I heard that a Frank Cooper in the East was accused of killing his wife under sensational circumstances . I hunted up Miss Collins to admit my defeat . " Any particular name to suggest ? " I asked . Miss Collins had one . " I come from . Indiana , " she said , " and I always thought Gary , Indiana , had a nice poetic sound . Elbert H. Gary , the city 's founder , be  --  came a great philanthropist , so I do n't see why you ca n't take his last name for your first name ? " Gary Cooper . I ran the name around in my mind a few times , and discovered that I liked it . As Miss Collins pointed out , Gary Cooper did n't sound as tall and lanky as Frank . The movies were new to mc , the name was new to me , and the new career and the new name seemed made for each other . A few years later , a neighbor of mine on the Paramount lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seeing me out sunning myself in front of my dressing room , decided to use my name while it was handy . Ever since Gary Crosby began singing with his old man , the name has picked up in popularity . Hi , Gary ! Give my regards to Bing.
