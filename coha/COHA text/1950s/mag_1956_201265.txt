Cyprus is not a U.S. base , but it is of strategic importance to the whole pattern of Western defense in the cold war . It is Britain 's command post for the Middle East ; it guards vital sources of oil supply ; it lies along the best line of communication between Europe and Asia ; it is in an area where there is no satellite buffer zone on the Soviet Union 's border . For those reasons the U.S. State Department has been watching anxiously the dispute between Britain and Cypriot nationalists who want enosis ( union ) with Greece . Behind the scenes the U.S. has been urging both sides to reach an agreement . <P> " A Kick in the Teeth . " Early last week the State Department moved publicly into the controversy . Appalled by British deportation of the Cypriot leader , Archbishop Myriarthefs Makarios , and by Britain 's general adoption of a " tough " policy , the State Department openly urged Britain to resume negotiations with the Cypriots . Announced State Department Press Officer Lincoln White : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached which would enable the people of Cyprus to achieve their legitimate desire of cooperation in the establishment of a government truly representative of the people of the island . " Privately , the U.S. attitude could be summed up in a question : What do we do about an ally who frisks nuns and deports an archbishop ? <P> London seethed at the implied rebuke in White 's statement , but the next development brought British reaction to the boiling point . Out of Athens came reports that Career Diplomat Cavendish Welles Cannon , U.S. Ambassador to Greece , had followed up the Washington statement with an expression of " sympathetic concern " for Greece , and praise for Greek " dignity and statesmanship " in the affair . British newspapers promptly roared that this was an insult to Great Britain ( a " kick in the teeth , " said London 's Daily Mail ) ; Sir Roger Makins , Britain 's Ambassador to the U.S. , officially demanded an explanation . <P> " Our Very Best Friends . " As the storm swirled up , the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to withdraw somewhat from the previous U.S. position . White summed it up : " We are not taking sides . " At his press conference President Eisenhower added his soothing voice : " Here is a place where two of our very best friends are engaged in an argument with very great difficulty . Now , we are friendly to both , not only friendly in the sense of traditional friendship with these two peoples , but on top of that , both are vitally necessary to NATO . . . So we are ready to do anything that is reasonable and practicable to help in reaching some solution , but the solution itself is going to have to be reached by the people most greatly concerned . " <P> At week 's end the British were some what mollified , but they were less than happy about the continued U.S. pressure for a resumption of negotiations , which in effect meant bringing back and dealing with the exiled archbishop . Just what the State Department was doing about this delicate situation was not apparent to the public eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not afford further deterioration of the Western position on Cyprus .
