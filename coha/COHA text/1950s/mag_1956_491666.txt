A mother reports how she rescued her little daughter from a dim , speechless ' world of emotional disorder , after the doctors had given up . T b , other day my seven-year-old daughter , Sandy , her brown eyes sparkling with mischief , sprang to my lap , knocked the newspaper from my hand and shouted , " Boo ! " It was one of the happiest moments of my life , for this seemingly ordinary incident was another milestone marking her return from a world of shadows to the sunshine and joy of normal childhood . Sandy is a lovely child , slim , delicate , marked with the grace of excellent physical co-ordination , Her intelligence is normal , and she has unusual abilities , in the keenness oilier observation , in her perceptive insight . But forfour years she has not talked . Fur a good part that time she was unable to laugh , unabh to love , unable to play . Distrustful of every-tine , she could not look directly at another 's face . She is nut alone . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have withdrawn from the main stream of living to a tightly locked world of their own . They arc the most neglected of all children with problems  --  barred from most schools , misunderstood by members of their own families , often deprived of treatment through lack of adequate facilities or the high cost of those few rum available . Yet these arc ? hiltham who can repay is ilh happy and usefullives all the effort put into their care , To fail to help them is to condemn them to heartbreak , . ind load society with the rust of useless , dependent lives . As the mother of such a child , I can till you that seeing her open her heart little by little to love and affection is an exciting experience . It is a creative task , challenging , sometimes discouraging , but always paying off in the joy of seeing a child come to life again . Her father and 1 feel also that we have gained a deeper understanding of all children , and so have been better parents to our three other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience will help other parents , . confused and frightened on finding that a child has retreated into the gray land of emotional disorders ; perhaps it will show that these children arc the victims of circumstances , not yet fully understood , which could have overwhelmed many another child . I am not discussing here the millions of children with lesser problems of emotional origin  --  children who wet the bed , children wha steal , or who have temper tantrums , or who can not gel along with others , children who arc extremely nervous or frightfully shy . For these millions , help is easier to obtain . They have school counseling services , remedial programs and agencies giving special help in many fields . I believe the psychiatric-guidance clinics are more willing to treat them . Moreover , since treatment is not likely to be so prolonged , the cost of it is within reason . Our experience may illustrate the situation faced by those who can not get help so easily . Of course , no one story is exactly like another . Even today no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or why , but the story of her short life offers many clues . Liveliness , determination , amiability ? these were her special characteristics in the first year of her life . She ? our second child ? arrived at three A.m. on a warm February morning in . New Orleans , " Weight , 7 pounds , I I ounces ; length , 2l 1/2 inches ; injuries and congenital anomalies , none , " the attending doctor wrote on the pages of her pink baby book . " One of the prettiest new babies rye ever seen , " was his comment . He was to be Sandy 's adopted " uncle " and friend as long as we lived in New Orleans . His affectionate medical care , had it continued , might have changed the course of her life . By the time Sandy was eight months old she had turned her stroller into a walker and toddled on fat legs after the rest of the children in our block . They flowed from one yard to another hardly noticing that there were boundaries between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything she did as a baby , whether it was rocking her dull and crooning " UN , Ubi. " as the New Orleans cook had taught her , or fitting blocks in I he roof of a toy house . Site was imitative and intensely feminine , entranced with a mirror and with new clothes or shoes . Her happy and uneventful babyhood lasted until she had just passed her first birthday . One Saturday afternoon I found her diaper stained a tarry black . I called our doctor . " What would cause such a discoloration ? " I asked without too much alarm . I was surprised when he said , " 1 ' 11 conic right out . " That blackness seas blood , and a tut of it , coming from somewhere high in the intestinal tract . For the next six months we saw it nearly every day . Blood tests , laboratory ( ALS , repeated examinations , became the pattern of living fur Sandy . The pricking , sticking and plodding , the number of strange trips ese took , the strange faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in her life she began to cry easily and often . In March , shortly before the birth of our third child , we took Sandy to the hospital for a series of gastru-intestinal X rays . Despite all our best efforts , she was frightened by the repeated trips to the X-ray room and the barium she had to drink . The ea:amniaLions were made at last with the nurses holding a screaming , struggling baby on the table . The X rays were entirely negative . Still the bleeding went on , while we continued with the round of examinations , consultations , laboratory tests and analyses . Sandy grew paler and thinner , more cross and irritable . The energy which had sent her flying through the house was gone ; instead she slumped in the play pen , often too listless to play with her tugs . In all of the mass of accumulated medical data , only one tiny clue was revealed , a slightly higher than normal proportion of a type of blood cell known as cotinophile . This condition , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hunch , our doctor dropped milk from Sandy 's diet , and within three days the bleeding stopped . In August of 1949 , just a few days after we had solved her physical troubles , we moved from New Orleans to Philadelphia . There was a kind of inspired confusion about otrr first months in Philadelphia , marked by unlikely accidents and minor crises , Then a protracted illness of mine necessitated a procession of strangers through the house to take care of our three children . Many months passed before that procession was ended with Dorothy . Whitaker . Her ample Isseican seems made for children to cuddle against . She is with us yet . " What happened to Sandy during those months ? %Vas anybody cruel to her ? Was she punished fur not getting to the bathroom on time ? Was she pushed aside fur the baby ? " Those are questions that I have been asked many times . I have always answered in the negative , but perhaps it should be a qualified negative . Nothing out of the ordinary happened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time at the loss of familiar tits , For Sandy , with her unusual sensitivity to the moods of others , the contact with strangers could have been unbearable . She seemed happy enough that year , playing with her baby sister , Marcie , and " taking care " oilier , responding well to direction , feeding herself wide the neatness of an adult ; but she had developed a disturbing trait of never quite meeting our eyes . She had also begun to suffer from skin eczema , which got progressively worse fur die next two or three years . At times her sheets were stained with blood in the morning ; inure than once her pajamas had to be soaked off with warm water . And must disquieting of aB , she talked less and less . By the time she was three years uld she did not talk at all . We felt that nursery school would be good for her . giving her playmates . So we enrolled her at the age of three in the Chestnut Hill Academy , taught by Mrs. Madeline Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset at staying home , When she did play , she did so with unusual physical co-ordination , But all too often , despite MIN .. Harper 's efforts , she slumped in a corner . And she did not talk at all . Then she revolted against what she obviously considered the untidy details of living , trying her utmost to avoid performing the eat retory functions , fighting and crying when we attempted to persuade her . At that point , in to5 I , we allowed her to be placed in a hospital specializing in children 's diseases for a series of diagnostic tests . She was then three and a half years " Her trouble might be all emotional , " the doctor told us , " but we would feel pretty silly if it were a brain tumor or kidney infection . Let 's find out everything we can about this child ; then we shall know how to treat her . " It sounded sensible  --  it still does . But we did not realize what the consequences to a child like Sandy might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , such as a spinal tap , which were pretty rugged . An electrocncephalugramthe charting of the pattern of brain waves  --  was also made , with the unfortunate result that she had an allergic reaction to the sedative given her to quiet her down for the procedure The drug induced constant vomiting , and her weakness was so ex tretne that she could not stand up . Sandy was tied to the bed and given fluid intravenously . Through all of this I was allowed to see her only at visiting hours , two hours a day , All tests were negative . With every physical cause for her troubles seemingly ruled out , we took her home , unaware at T H first huw touch the stay in the hospital had taken out of her . She would no longer Iced herself  --  and did not for two years . Site allowed herself to be petted , but never showed any sign of affection in return . She no longer rime to us of her own volition at all . She ignored everything that was said to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We think she may have turned her hearing off and on at will . kVorst of all , anything suggestive of doctors or their paraphernalia sent her into literal hysteria . She had been fond of our owe family doctor ; now , when he Cattle to the house , she ran sobbing to Dorothy in the kitchen or hid under the bed or behind a curtain . She was afraid of all strangers , and especially those who reached toward her . The shoe salesman terrified her . She cowered from the salesgirls who tried to help her try on clothes , and refused to have anything to do with any new or unfamiliar clothing . When we tried to brush her teeth , she clamped her teeth shut and fought . She screamed when we shampooed her hair , In short , Sandy wrapped herself in a shell of loneliness and nightmare terror . Child-guidance clinics seemed the obvious place for the professional help we needed , and tu them we went . It is not my purpose to criticize these clinics . They have done wonderful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures under which they work compel them to institutionalize their approach . But I write of our experience as an example of what is apt to happen to parents of a child desperately in need of help . Briefly , the fees at One clinic we re set so high that even on an income well above aver-age we could not afford them ; nor were we given a feeling of confident e that the lengthy and expensive treatment would be of any benefit At is second clinic eve went through the entire diagnostic procedure twice , with an interval of a year between . No diagnosis was ever made . We were told that the clinic could not help Sandy , and there was a discouraging intimation that no one could help her . Except for Mrs. Harper , at the Chestnut Hill Academy , them was no one to whom we had turned for aid who seemed to care whether Sandy recovered or was doomed to a lifetime of mental illness . I looked at her , her thin body covered with eczema , her face sad and remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her worse . I had cringed before the tribal clich6s of social workers , been apologetic to nurses , pussyfooted before everybody from whom I had sought help It was hardly a shining record . At that moment my husband and I resolved to make Sandy well by our own efforts . Iam not disparaging the work of psychiatrists and others struggling with this problem . If we could have got psychiatric help , we would have taken it , as we cheerfully did at a later date . But I do think that parents themselves can make use of forces available to no one else  --  the tics of home and family , for instance , and their intimate knowledge of the The strength I found from that decision was like an answer to a prayer ; Sandy began to change . With the perceptive ability she had never lost , 1 believe she sensed the change from a negative attitude of uncertainty about what tu do , to the positive attitude of reaching out to her in sureness . The walls between us began to crumble . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be drawn up ; an intuitive feeling for what was best at the moment had to be our guide . We eliminated virtually all discipline far many , many months  --  until the time came when Sandy herself demonstrated that she could accept discipline . Instead , we tried to show our love , especially after she had dune something destructive , naughty or unacceptable . She never lust the ability to know what was wrong ; we believed that she just could n't help herself . We did not put tier under the slightest pressure to conform to any standard of behavior . With the pressure off , incidents of behavior that would be counted as unacceptable became rarer . Sometimes we saw Sandy punish herself for her misdeeds , slapping her own hand . Now she has begun to demand some discipline , even to enjoy it . In any case , we resulted to treat her with good humor and happiness . No one in the house has talked to her in despairing tones . Laughter has been the most healing of all our medicines . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did not come into contact with them unnecessarily . In this we had the support of our family doctor , whose tactful treatment has done much to allay Sandy 's fears . At the same time we gave her toy medical kits . At first she threw them away . Finally , however , she gingerly used the toy stethoscope on her dolls , then on me . Did you know a case of measles could be a happy occasion ? For us it was , for , when she was six years old , a red-spotted Sandy lay passively in bed for an examination without slowing fear , In September of I ! t = , when Sandy was four years old , I sat with her on my lap and drew a crude outline of a cat . She glanced at it only casually . Six weeks later , after our fourth child , Jeff , was born , she drew the outline of the cat dozens of times . It was one of the first chinks in the wall . At home and at school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleeping , eating . She ( Continued from rase So dress ? cats and cam . swings and slides , baby carriages and tulips . She drew a picture of a woman in bed , and a woman with the tiny figure of a baby inside her rounded skirt  --  undoubt  --  re me . She thew wiih toothpicks , tray-ems . IrCnt-115 and paintbrushes ; she drew on the tile walls of the bathroom with her finger paint and she drew in mud with The emotional wall was still intact , but cracks multiplied . She colored pictures in coloring books , infinitely detailed and neat . She loved jig-saw puzzles and worked them speedily . I began to sing to her . singing insinwlions which once in a while she heeded . I rocked her in a chair and sang to her about herself , how she grew from a tins- baby anti learned to do many things . Her eyes fame up and met mine ; she listened contentedly and came bark fin more . She began want my physical closeness , coming to Me lOr comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doll equipment . dolls of every sort  --  we gave her everything we could to encourage her to play out her troubles . I am no psychiatrist , I lase no right to trs interpret that plan . but even I might read some meaning into the punishment I once use her give it mother doll ; even more striking was her attitude toward a dull that was almost another Sandy in size and tilt wing She would have nothing to do with ti his nearly a ? ear . after which it became her constant companion , We had been a little worried about her reaction to a new baby brother . but she Grind the baby stimula Ling . She liked to hold him in her lap , and she eagerly observed every detail of baby care . Once in a while she liked to sleep in the crib ; that was all right too . She has been protective toward him ; I have seen her drop beside him and put her arms about him when a rush amber children seemed to threaten a jostling . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first clay she cried when l left the house ! To see her shyly slip through the fence to join the neighboring children . to prance once again in front of a mirror , to try on shoes , put on a new dress , submit to toothbrushing and shampooing  --  all these have warmed my heart . Little things , ordinary things . but to inc they are minor miracles . Some are not so little . Lam summer a particle was embedded in her eye . With fear and trembling , I took her to the ail it of the oculist  --  the first trip she has made to any medical office in almost four years . She did not become hysterical , as she would have it year earlier , but she was fracful and clung to me . On the second trip she was a little more relaxed ; on the third and last . she virtually danced in and without hesitation followed the doctor 's instructions . Some this progress has been due to the valuable allies we love gained in the past year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found a psydiiatrist whose approach was that of a warm friend . " The medicine I use  --  the only medicine  --  is the relationship which I usean build with your daughter , " she told Sandy cried in fear w hen she first was taken to visit . II was only very gradually that she accepted this outsider who was called by the fearful name of " Doctor . " The wariness is entirely gone now . She looks forward to her visits . and lately has become deliberately mischievous . " Flow wonderful ! " the psychiatrist commented , when first Sandy began to tease . " This is one of the healthiest developments yet ! " The other major ally is a small private elementary school which enrolls sti per cent normal children with . - 2.11 per cent emotionally disturbed children of normal genre . As far as we know , it is the only school in the country set upon the prim iplr that normal children hasten the recovery of the others by pulling them into group life , " It 's a kind of sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them change and grow , " Mrs. Lena Sklar , the director of the school , has said to inc . " That is the measure of our success here  --  nut imposing buildings or equipment , but ' lie changes we can nuke an children 's lives . Vie have our graduates everywhere . in colleges , in business , leading happy normal lives , That is success you can feel in your heart . " The normal children are also benefited , she feels , by learning patience and understanding to a measure some adults never achieve . Thus they are being prepared for adult life . where their success arid happiness will depend on living in harmony wilt all kinds of ticople . Sandy loves school . She leaves me without a backward glance , races in and joins her friends . She does nut vet use speech , but at last she " tells " mr. things . For instance . hand across t hest. the repeats in sound the cadences of the pledge of allegiance to the Hag . Then . dropping her arms to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ da da-dada ? " I sing " My Country . ' T is of Thee " with her , and she is overcome with delight . Speech is on the way . though no one can tell how long it may take . The block is very great . 1 said to her not long ago , when she cried because she could n't go visiting with her aster , " Sandy , when you arc ready to try to talk , you can do lots of things that are a little hard for you now . " She put her hand on my chin and enured it up and down , while making small sounds of her own . It was almost an appeal to touch a button somewhere that would make her talk . Some words she does use now ? " amen " at the end of a prayer . " stop " and " go " when we read about The Little Fat Policeman , and a few others . In many other svays she is becoming interested in things outside herself  --  she loves stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She even does small chores about the house . like setting the table or raking leaves . Occasionally her abilities get ahead ans . We never realize how close is her observation until we discover her heating up sugar and egg whiles  --  that she has separated  --  and putting diem in the oven fora meringue or calmly operating the washer and drier . Several weeks ago she discovered another technique . " I 'm sure , " said my husband , emerging from the cellar one day , " that the city of Philadelphia do  --  s n't know it can tic dune , but Sandy has found a way to block the hands of the water meter ! " Of course , we arc not at the end of the road . With a child 's mind at stake , we can afford patience . We are content to watch and to enjoy this slots ' unfolding ; in our own hearts we are certain of its eventual completion . Meanwhile , we give her all our love . , And our reward is in seeing the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @
