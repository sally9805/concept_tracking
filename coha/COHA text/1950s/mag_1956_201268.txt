The combination of hot air and cold political calculation can stir up a squall in almost any year , and such were the ingredients of the storm that swirled around the head of Vice President Richard Nixon . The cold calculation came from the Democrats , who have long made Nixon their favorite target . The hot air came principally from columnists and other pundits who reasoned that the Democrats had made Nixon a political liability and therefore Ike might drop him from the ticket . For Nixon , it was like being in the eye of a hurricane . <P> Last week President Eisenhower dispelled the storm with as flat a statement as a presidential candidate is ever likely to make about his prospective running mate . " Anyone , " said the President at his news conference , " who attempts to drive a wedge between Dick Nixon and me is-has just about as much chance as if he tried to drive it between my brother and me ... I will say it in exactly the terms I mean : I am very happy that Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on any political ticket in which I was a candidate with him . Now if these words are n't plain , then it is merely because people ca n't understand the plain , unvarnished truth . " <P> <P> Ike went out of his way to emphasize that he had come to no new conclusion , that he was merely repeating in stronger language what he had said before . <P> Black Cloud . The paradox of the whole affair was that the storm , despite its beginnings , had turned into a phenomenon so real that it had fooled many a Republican . G.O.P. Chairman Len Hall was one of the first to see it coming and tried to head it off ; immediately after Ike announced his intention of running for a second term , Hall hailed Nixon as a " great American , " adding , " and a great American is , in my opinion , a strong candidate . " <P> <P> The Nixon story became an intensely personal drama , and cartoonists dealt with it as such . As the clouds got blacker some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnamed but highly placed G.O.P. leaders were telling Ike that Nixon should go . <P> White House Call . Then , the day before his press conference last week , Ike called Nixon to the White House and told him what he would say next day . Within 24 hours , Nixon got more good news from the New Hampshire primary , where he received a remarkable total of 22,936 votes-all of them write-ins-for Vice President . <P> <P> Neither Ike 's statement nor the New Hampshire votes could guarantee that the Nixon storm was over ; Nixon was still an attractive target for Democrats who did not want to waste their ammunition on Eisenhower . But as far as politicians were concerned , last week was the week that Dick Nixon , for all practical purposes , was nominated .
