It was Saturday in Washington , D.C. , but not every school was closed . In front of one ? a converted town house in a fashionable neighborhood ? big black limousines with embassy license plates pulled up to the curb . Little children toting small briefcases and chattering happily in Russian scampered across the sidewalk and pushed into the side door . It was 8:45 , the beginning of another day at what is perhaps the most unusual educational institution in America : the primary school for children of Soviet and Czech diplomats stationed in Washington . By special permission of the Soviet Government , I was allowed to spend that Saturday at the school in order to gather material for this exclusive report to The Saturday Evening Post . The facts I collected and the impressions I gained afford considerable insight into Soviet educational methods on the lower level . This Soviet primary school , known to some Washington wags as the Little " Red " Schoolhouse , consists of grades one through four . ( Soviet children of secondary level  --  grades five through ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The curriculum is identical to that of all other primary schools in the U.S.S.R. Soviet children , on reaching the age of seven , must enroll in the first grade . They attend class four or five hours a day , six days a week , observing only a few holidays , such as the October revolution and the New Year . They study the same textbooks as do all Soviet children , cover the same specified subject matter and must pass the same final examination at the end of the fourth grade . The teachers are sent to the United States by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for two- or three-year assignments , after which they return to their normal teaching posts in Russia . Now it was time to enter the Red school . I followed the children through the cloakroom entrance . The older ones helped the younger children take off their coats and hang them on hooks . They smiled at me shyly . Some greeted me in Russian . A few spoke a hesitant " Good morning , ma'am . " Then they scampered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not quite nine o'clock , so the boys made a beeline for a row of chess boards . A group of girls formed a ring to play a sort of " patty-cake " circle game . Youngsters continued to flock in . Soon there were about fifty children aged seven to eleven gathered in the large reception-recreation room , which was dominated by a massive oil painting of Lenin . In the far corner a life-sized gilded head of Lenin rested on a scarlet-draped pedestal . I watched the children at their play . Most of the little girls had pigtails . Some wore a single thick braid down the back . A few had two braids looped and crossed at the neck and tied up with gay ribbons . Several wore the brown serge , long-sleeved dress with pleated skirt , white lace collar and black pinafore apron which is the usual uniform of all little schoolgirls in Moscow . Many of them wore long brown stockings with black or brown shoes , usually high and laced . However , none of the little boys wore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on Soviet schoolboys . These well-scrubbed little tads all had on neat sweaters , shirts and slacks or regular suits . Although most of the children were not yet able to speak English , I soon discovered they could all understand my English better than my Russian . Normally , Soviet children do not begin the study of a foreign language until the fifth grade , when an estimated 40 per cent take up English . They study the same language for the next live years , graduating from " high school " with a fairly good reading knowledge and a limited ability to speak it . But at this school , the Soviet Embassy has hired a fiery pretty American girl to come in five days a week , following the regular school session , to give all children , except the first-graders , formal English instruction . They use the same Scott , Foresman &; Company readers that the American children in my own neighborhood use at school . One little pigtailed lass was particularly proud of her ability to read her American book . During a recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me : " See Jane . See Jane and Deck . This is their father . He goes to verk. - Soon I heard the soft tinkle of the nine-o'clock bell , Instantly all play ceased . These boys and girls . like their counterparts all over the U.S.S.R .. lined up before the doors to their classrooms . One by one , they entered , stood silently behind their desks until their teacher came in , bade them good morning and asked them to be seated . The class monitor  --  a different student is selected each day  --  dosed the door , collected the copybooks with the previous night 's homework assignments , and gave them to the teacher . Soviet children have a lot of homework . Usually , it is about an hour in the first grade and ranges up to a good four hours nightly in high school . They used to have an even heavier load . However , two years ago , following the protest of school doctors about the need for children to have some time off to relax and play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday or to require more than the specified daily maximum . The first room I visited contained the first and second grades . ( There are not enough embassy children this year to warrant more than one teacher for two grades . ) I gazed around the room . Although the gay linoleum on the floor , the desks and chairs lined up in neat rows facing the teacher , and the blackboards were U. S.-made , there was no mistaking this classroom for an American one . Above each teacher 's desk was a handsomely framed , colored portrait of Lenin . Another picture of him hung on a side wall , There were no other pictures . There were no examples of the children 's work . It was a stark atmosphere . " We do not want the attention of the pupils to be distracted from their lessons or from the teacher . " On this Saturday morning the first-graders were hard at work on their arithmetic lesson . The teacher called upon the children for the answers to the problems she had written on the blackboard : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , gave his answer , and if it was correct , he was told to write it on the board . If his answer was wrong , the teacher promptly called upon another student . Children who knew the answers sometimes raised their hands , not in the energetic manner of American children , but with elbows kept on the table . My attention was caught by the inkwells resting on the desks . Each of these wells sat on a bright square mat of oilcloth woven of one-inch red and yellow strips , which , 1 later learned , were made by the children during their weekly hour of craftwork . All written work in a Soviet school is done in ink  --  even by first-graders . " Using ink teaches them to be careful , to think through the task at hand before starting it , " one of the Soviet teachers told me , While the arithmetic lesson for the first grade was in progress , the second-graders were copying a story from their readers into their copybooks . This was a " Russian-language " class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penmanship . As they wrote , the teacher gently shifted some of them into a better writing posture . Noting that all children were using their right hands , I asked what was done about left-handed youngsters . " All children are taught to write with their right hand ; they may use their left hand for throwing a ball , though. - When they had finished their writing , the teacher asked them if there were any new words they wished to have explained . In response to two raised hands , she carefully pronounced each of the unfamiliar words , and explained its meaning through illustrations as well as synonyms . Then she called upon one of the students to come before the class and tell the story he had just copied . The Soviets place great emphasis on the ability of the students to retell what they have read . The child learns through such training to read for meaning , grasping the main ideas as well as substantive detail . In grading the recitation of the pupil , no consideration or allowance appears to be made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ill . He is marked strictly on the quality of his oral presentation : five for excellent , four for very good , three for satisfactory , two for poor , and one for failure , This grading system is used throughout the U.S.S.R. These cumulative daily marks , plus weekly tests , quarterly and final examinations , determine his year 's grade for the subject . He must pass all basic subjects with at least a three  --  satisfactory  --  to be promoted to the next grade . Physical education , craftwork , drawing , and singing are not regarded as basic subjects . A grade of two  --  poor  --  in one or two subjects can be made up during the summer by passing another test successfully in August . Those who receive more than two poor grades or who fail a subject are required to repeat the grade . And in the U.S.S.R. as a whole , an estimated IC ) per cent annually do repeat a grade . I looked at the copybooks . The penmanship was beautiful . The pages contained horizontal guide lines less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one-eighth inch apart . The letters placed in the small " boxes " thus created , were exceptionally clear and easy even fora foreigner to read . Just as the last copybook had been collected , the bell rang for the first recess . The children left the room row by row . The period had lasted forty-five minutes . Throughout this time these little children had remained completely quiet , attentive , giving no sign , through squirming or fidgeting , that they were restless or finding the long session too much . The pace had been quick , precise , efficient . There April 26 , 1958 Turning to the fourth-grades , the teacher called upon them one at a time to give their answers to the problems in finding the volume of each of the wooden cubes she had previously distributed . While they were answering , another student was sent to the board to work out a practical problem : Given a storage bin full of potatoes which is six meters long , four meters wide and three meters deep , find the weight of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked through the arithmetic book which every Soviet fourth-grade pupil must complete . Here arc several of the problems in the unit on fractions : Three-fourths km plus one-eighth km equals-One-fifth cc plus one-half cc equals ? A problem in practical application in that unit was : Find how many square meters there are in one half hectare , in four fifths hectare , in one tenth hectare ( a hectare contains 2.471 acres ) . The final arithmetic examination for promotion from primary school into the fifth grade covers addition , subtraction , multiplication and division of whole numbers ; the metric system and measures of time ; addition and subtraction of fractions ; and elemen tary mensuration . Pupils arc expected to apply their knowledge and to solve simple problems involving whole numbers and fractions . I was told later that arithmetic ends at the conclusion of Grade 5 , which includes fractions , decimals , percentages and proportions . Slide rules are introduced at this time . Algebra and geometry begin in Grade 6 . For comparison , United States students normally .... study algebra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-graders , a few of whom were still studying the reading assignment . The little girl in front of me had finished , however , and was staring in fascination at an anatomical drawing of the human body . I noted the page and turned to it , somewhat surprised to find an illustration of this type in a literature book I had supposed to be full of poems and famous passages of prose . I examined the reader more closely . It included excerpts of outstanding Russian and foreign authors . But this did n't alter the topical arrangement . The primer was planned by sections : the seasons , climate , school and family , fables , city and village , Soviet geographical data  --  including habitats of animals , reptiles , fish , discussions of vegetation and river systems  --  great scientists , inventors and travelers , the human body and historical data of the U.S.S.R. Along with passages on the anatomy of the body , describing muscles , bones , nervous system , and so on , there were cross-sections of the eye , the ear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out the function of these organs , described the types of infectious diseases to which they arc prone , and discussed means of avoiding and combating some of them . Illustrations of different important microbes showed the children what germs look like . Later on , when I had a chance to survey the literature readers for the other grades , I found this same practice followed : simple concepts of nature , history and geography systematically presented via excerpts of famous poetry and prose . Following the first two forty-five-minute periods , Soviet pupils are allowed a break for tea . A woman whose job it was to assist the teachers brought out trays filled with large mugs . Each child squared a napkin on his desk , set the mug upon it , and produced fruit , cookies or other snacks brought from home . The last class at the Little " Red " Schoolhouse on that Saturday morning was the weekly hour devoted to era ft-work , where 1 saw boys and girls in the first two grades embroidering flowers and butterflies on doilies . About 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's education is devoted to crahwork and painting , I was told . Music absorbs another 4 per cent , and sports activities 8 per cent . " Frill subjects " such as photography , orchestra and dramatics are conducted after school hours . In other words , 80 per cent of the class time of a Soviet student at primary level is spent mastering language skills , learning arithmetic and studying science , history and geography . And because of the longer school week , fewer holidays and shorter summer vacations , Soviet children spend 61 as many hours in class in ten years as do American children in twelve . Once again I heard the soft tinkle of the bell . Lessons were over at the Little " Red " Schoolhouse . I watched through the window as the children argued over where they would sit in the cars going home . It seems the front seat of each car is reserved for the one or two students with the best marks that day in class . The acknowledged winners took their places next to the drivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed and the Cars drove out of sight .
