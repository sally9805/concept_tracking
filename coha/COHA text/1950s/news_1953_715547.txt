txt On the basis of a survey from twenty foreign capitals published in this newspaper yesterday there seems to be some uncertainty as to the picture of America that the State Department , particularly through the editing of its information libraries abroad , intends to present to the world . We like to believe , and do believe , that if mistakes have been made they have been made because Secretary Dulles was busy with other things and not because he approved of the political , economic and social " nice-Nellyism " that has shown its fatuous head in our libraries around the world . We do not refer to the withdrawal or absence from our State Department libraries of information of books of obviously Communist propaganda . We refer to ; : he blanket rule that no book writton or edited by anybody who has ever invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Congressional committee should be allowed in any library of information abroad ; or that no book by any " suspected Communist " should be included , regardless of who did the suspecting and on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro medical statistics " should not be offered through us to foreign readers ; or that an anthology of American humor should Te omitted on the ground that the editor admittedly was once sympathetic to communism . A little American humor might do us all good . It might help us to enjoy some of the doings and sayings of the junior Senator from Wisconsin . We do not for a moment suppose that Secretary Dulles drew up the list of books which were taken off the shelves of the information libraries abroad and which this newspaper was yesterday able to publish in part . We do not suppose that Mr. Dulles would take the position that lists such as this should be treated as hush-hush , top drawer , highly confidential information which it would be disastrous to allow to leak out . Such lists and the words accompanying them do leak out . They do not expose this country to foreign invasion . They do not lay waste our cities . But they doubtless do make many intelligent persons abroad wonder if there is any similarity between our cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Hitler and of communism under whomever it happens to be . As a people we naturally want to make as good an impression as we can on other nations . The best impression we can make probably derives from our democratic practices , freedoms and beliefs . If the literary expressions of these practices , freedoms and beliefs are to be censored , edited , revised and Bowdlerized by committees of Congress there may be some wonderment as to what such traditions mean . Let us admit that books placed in State Department libraries of information abroad and paid for out of the taxpayers ' money should be more carefully scrutinized than those in libraries at home or in book stores . We are not called upon to spread the mad doctrine of ignorance , falsehood and hate that is known as the Communist party line . We could very well exclude one or two books on the expurgated list . But where there is an honest discussion of a controversial issue it is in line with our traditions to present it . It is no crime , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that we are not always scrupulously fair to our domestic minorities , or to suggest that there has sometimes been corruption in our Government and in our business , or to intimate that one law-abiding political party is possibly better than another . Anybody with a little perspicacity add a little time to give to the job , perhaps even somebody who could define an " et cetera , " could have laid down a State Department library policy without being ridiculous . But nobody did . The policy as reported is ridiculous . We have no reason to be afraid of a true portrait of America presented through books of fact and of opinion . We do not need to be ashamed of differing opinions . The whole essence of democracy is to allow scope for differing opinions and to give them pdliceful expression . In our natural and commendable eagerness to ggt rid of the Communist influence we ought not to let ourselves be tempted into using tactics already discredited by Fascist , Nazi and Communist regimes . Ours is a good country and a good system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the world know the whole of it .
