In their tireless effort to determine how Soviet policy is made , Western diplomats are often in the position of anthropologists trying to reconstruct a dinosaur from the evidence of one jawbone . But when Nikita Khrushchev performed his clumsy about-face on the summit meeting last week , the reason was plain to see . He had been driven to it by Red China 's Mao Tse-tung . <P> As has happened before , Khrushchev 's cocky impetuosity had got him into trouble . In the days after the Iraqi coup , Nikita conducted his Mideast summit negotiations with the offhand decisiveness of a man who feels no need to consult anyone before he answers his mail . When Eisenhower 's note proposing a U.N . summit conference arrived in Moscow , Khrushchev and some of his top aides were in conference with a group of visiting Austrians . " Will you excuse us ? " said Nikita . " We have to draft a reply to Eisenhower 's letter . " In just 20 minutes , his acceptance note outlined , Khrushchev reappeared . <P> In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracy toward a summit meeting inside U.N.-a hostility clearly indicated by the fact that the first reactions of the kept Soviet press to the proposal were uniformly unfavorable . Worse yet , he obviously failed to keep in touch with Mao , whose journalistic mouthpieces , right up to the moment that Khrushchev accepted the proposal , were denouncing it as " deceptive , " " ridiculous , " " full of pitfalls . " <P> Then came the flight to Peking-a journey that to gleeful Asians seemed to be Khrushchev 's dutiful response to a hurry-up call from Mao . For four days , behind the ancient red walls of Peking 's Imperial City , the two arbiters of the Communist world negotiated . When they emerged to shake hands for the photographers , the Peking line had become the Moscow line as well . <P> The Crackdown . This was not the first time Mao Tse-tung had made himself felt in Moscow . For two years Communist specialists in the West have been speculating that Mao had something close to a veto over some aspects of Soviet policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October revolt that brought Wladyslaw Gomulka to power in Warsaw-reported that Mao was pressuring the Soviets to follow a more liberal policy toward the satellites . Warsaw and Belgrade saw Mao as their best champion in the Kremlin . <P> At that point , Mao was talking big about " letting one hundred flowers bloom " - until the blooming flowers of self-criticism set off such disorder in his own garden that he had to call the whole thing off . From then on , Peking worked against Gomulka and Tito by attacking Yugoslav " revisionism " even more savagely than did the Russians themselves . But the Mao-is-tops theorists stuck to their theory , while reversing their field : now it was not Mao the liberal they cheered , but Mao the hard they feared .
