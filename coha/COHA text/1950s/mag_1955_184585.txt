With a brand of reckless courage that few U.S. males have been able to muster , Editor in Chief John Fischer in the August issue of Harper 's magazine delivered a stinging treatise on an explosive subject : American womanhood . His thesis : U.S. wives have made U.S. husbands their slaves , and are molding them to feminine will . Wrote Fischer , still holding lightly to his male 's caution : " This undaunted approach may , perhaps , have something to do with the divorce rate , axe murders , and the number of morose characters nursing a shot glass late at night in men 's bars . " <P> Warming to his subject , Jack Fischer tossed caution overboard : " Never before in history has any nation devoted so large a share of its brains and resources to the sole purpose of keeping its women greased , deodorized , corseted , enshrined in chrome convertibles , curled , slenderized , rejuvenated , and relieved of all physical labor . <P> " In benighted lands , from England to Indonesia , women are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pleasanter and easier for their breadwinners ; only here is the Ideal Male one who dedicates his life to the pampering of women . In India , for example , as recently as 1953 , a woman was observed in the act of fixing a quiet room and a cool drink for a husband on his way home from work . In Dallas and Des Moines , as we all know , the ladies make a different kind of preparation . <P> " That precious moment when the male stumbles back to his lair , numb and exhausted , is what they have been waiting for all day . By striking hard while his resistance is low , they know they can pressure him into almost anything . This , then , is the Conversation Hour : the time to touch lightly on the need for a new vacuum cleaner , his gaucheries at last night 's bridge party , the prospects for remedying his cultural poverty . . . <P> " Never in history has any country contained such a high proportion of cowed and eunuchoid males , drilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never , do they drop cigar ashes in the icebox , prop their feet on a coffee table , leave an unwashed dish in the sink . . . They endure their married lives in mute docility , and die mercifully early in life from ulcers and high blood pressure . " <P> As feminine protests began to pour in last week , Jack Fischer , married these 19 years , * allowed that his acid ode might have been " an unfortunate lapse . " Said he in a somewhat cowed tone : " Believe me , certainly no lady in my family , and no lady of my acquaintance even , fits the description . " <P> * To a Scotswoman.
