PART VII : THE INTENTIONAL PASS // Among the most debated and second guessed plays in baseball is the intentional pass . A sports announcer I know claims it 's never good baseball . According to him the batter purposely passed scores too many times . I will agree that the intentional pass is a dangerous gamble . for the intentional walk comes in the last of the ninth inning , with the winning run in scoring position for the opposing team . With a runner on third and less than two out , it 's almost mandatory that a manager employ this strategy . If walking the first batter brings to the plate a weaker hitter , so much the better . // Most managers also accept the practice of issuing a base on balls to the eighth-place batter if a runner is in scoring position  --  to get at the pitcher . A good many times this is questionable strategy , because of the obvious advantage for the defense to have the pitcher lead off the following inning . A lot of course depends on just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the batting ability of the pitcher . Sometimes , too , the manager will order a base on balls to the eighth-place hitter in an attempt to force the opposing manager to remove a certain pitcher . // Larry ( Yogi ) Berra , a master of catching strategy , employs another intentional pass maneuver quite often . With the runners on first and third , or perhaps first and second , Berra will be extra careful in having his pitcher deal with a certain hitter , even if it results in a base on balls . His reasoning : a base on balls does not score any runs , but a solid base hit could put the game beyond recall . // Setting up a double play represents another reason often advanced to justify use of the intentional pass . With a right-handed pitcher it 's undoubtedly good logic to pass the rough left-handed batter to get to a right-hander of lesser ability . Ordinarily , you 'll find it easier to double the right-hand batter , particularly if he is a pull hitter. // The most controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on base . It 's axiomatic that this should never be done , but I have personally looked back many times and wished I had done it . // Admittedly the odds must be heavily in your favor when you order the tying run to first . And they must be overwhelmingly on your side when you decide the time has come to put the winning run on base . The maneuver is highly dangerous . // An example : In Detroit in 1954 , Boston had a runner on second with two out . The hitter was Ted Williams on a hot streak and in his favorite park . Ted represented the tying run as he came up in the eighth inning . Manager Fred Hutchinson took the big gamble and ordered Pitcher Ned Garver to walk Ted . Jackie Jensen picked on Garver 's next pitch and sent it screaming into the upper deck at Briggs Stadium for a three-run homer . // An even more costly example occurred in the famous fourth game of the 1947 World Series when Yankee Pitcher Floyd Bevens came within one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The Yankees held a 2-1 lead over the Brooklyn Dodgers as the game moved into the last half of the ninth . With two away and Al Gionfriddo on first and the count three and one on Pistol Pete Reiser , Gionfriddo stole second . // At this point , Yankee manager Stanley ( Bucky ) Harris ordered Reiser passed . Eddie Stanky was due up next . This meant putting the potential winning run on base . One of the most dramatic games in World Series history ended suddenly on Bevens ' second pitch , as Cookie Lavagetto thundered a double off the right field wall to score both runners and win the game . // A good lesson for any manager can be learned from these stories . If you are convinced you are making the correct move after calculating the risks involved , you must have the courage to act in spite of adverse criticism and rampant second-guessing. // The tying or winning run has been put on base many times by various managers . Unfortunately , we seldom hear of the times it proves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight  --  but managers have to expect that .
