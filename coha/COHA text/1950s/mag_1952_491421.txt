T seemed a simple assignment  --  in the beginning . One of those self-appointed editors who start their letters : " I do n't know anything about writing for the magazines , but I 'd like to give you a little advice , " dropped a challenge into my lap . " You 've told us a lot about movie stars who 've been around so long they 're turning brown at the edges , " he wrote . " How about telling us about a star who 's just switching on the old candlepower , and what a young actor or actress who 's parking a foot on the bottom rung of Hollywood 's ladder is up against these days ? " My first thought was , What they 're up against is no mystery . They 're up against how soon they 'll be able to afford a swimming pool . They 're up against the necessity of pretending annoyance at autograph seekers and people who stare at them when they make expensively tailored or mink-swathed entrances . It was an instinctive thought ; one any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie beat for several years , I had a second thought . In another part of my mind I knew that being a star is n't wholly a matter of ringside tab/es at Ciro 's or seeing one 's name in Louella 's or Hedda 's column or being able to buy the plushy things of life . It also involves hard work and guarding oneself against competitors who , given half 13 chance , will plant a heel in your face in their climb . So maybe my self-appointed editor had something . Maybe it would be revealing to try to put together a case history of a newcomer movie actor or actress , including not only what he or she gets out of being a star but what being a star exacts in return . My only worry was that not enough things have had a chance to happen to a budding star to add uP to a story . After all , it takes time to build the legend of a colorful personality . I thought , I 'll get around that by serving up a double order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll work out on both of them at once . That was why I selected the newlywed stars Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis for my research . Tony is twenty-six . Janet is twenty-four . To date . Curtis has appeared in a handful of films . Janet Leigh ? it is pronounced to rhyme with the Lee in Robert E. Lee  --  has been in about a dozen , her most recent being Angels in the Outfield , with Paul Douglas , and Two Tickets to Broadway , with TonY Martin ; also , Just This Once , and Scaramouche . Curtis is the latest version of the ever-recurrent Hollywood phenomenon , the bobby-soxers ' drealn ? As such , he is immensely valuable to his employers , Universal-International , who have wisely subjected his histrionic ability to minimum stress by casting him principally in the kind of Arabian Nights roles in which he wanders about in baggy Turkish pants , hotly pursuing a houri , usually Yvonne De Carlo or Piper Laurie . Such restrained handling has paid off handsomely at the box office . So huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smugly skiP their usual routine of multiplying the actual con ' tents of an actor 's mail sack by ten when mentioning it . Even when they level about it , Tony 's rave correspondence is sufficiently impressive . Janet Leigh is also a favorite dish of the hot-rodand-blue-jeans set . To them , her marriage to TonY is so phenomenally appropriate as to qualify for the ? Phrase " drool-making . " At high-school parties the gym rafters resound to yakety-yaketing about " I hear Janet 's just mad for Tony , " and " They say Pony 's mad for Janet . " During the course of preliminary briefings about these stellar lovebirds by spokesmen for their respective employers , I was assured , " Tony 's a kid from the ? Bronx who soared to stardom overnight . We flew him out here to Hollywood on a nonstop pink cloud and he has n't got off it yet . Even before his first picture , we knew we had something . Like he goes to the beach and he has no swimming trunks , so he wears blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run pix of him in those jagged-bottomed pants and hysteria breaks out . I 've Seard ' Joe DiMaggio looks good if he 's only hang- ing up his towel in the locker room . ' Tony 's like that too . " Of Janet Leigh I 'd been told , " She did n't have to act in the ingenue roles she played up until recently . Not this doll . She really is that way . She 's the beat prospect Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has had since Liz Taylor checked in . She 's not just another cutiepie poking a sweater out pleasantly here and there and bouncing around in front of a camera . For a long time she played Cinderella sitting in the ashes before the ball . But since Howard Hughes borrowed her for RKO and gave her his patented ' sexy-siren ' treatment , everything 's a ball for her . " Before she went to RKO , she was a girl who said ' Jeepers ' if she was excited . She 's got a thirty-eight-inch bust and a twenty-one-inch waist , but she was self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealment . RKO explained to her in words of one syllable that an exciting figure  --  not diamonds  --  can be a girl 's best friend . " A Director " Explains " the Actress B UT when I persisted in my questioning I discovered that the story of Janet Leigh and Tony Cur-t18 did not make everyone drool . They both might he tiding a cloud , but the color of that cloud was not necessarily pink to all who watched it in flight . Some of the glitter began to wear off their success story when I talked to an elderly director about them . He had a reputation for " stinging " dialogue in his films . Listening to him , I understood why . His voice grated like gravel scrunched under shoe leather . He rared back in his chair , flipped words at Me like spitballs . " To me , Janet Leigh is Hollywood 's most puzzling distaff split personality , " he said . " On the surface she 's a shapely chatterbox in her mid-twenties . The callY apparent split in her personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wriggly puppy ; other times her face is so serious it haunts you . " Nevertheless , and notwithstanding , " the gritty- ! awed director warned me , " there 's an enigma in the Leigh woodpile . I 'll give her two things : she 's pretty and she 's talented . But aside from that , her personality is a strictly ersatz one and a Product of sweaty press-agentry . The picture they give you of her is she 's about sixteen and you dass n't ' , iaY a naughty word in front of her . This act fails to auodwink me , my friend . I do n't buy the fact that any girl who looks that sexy can be a wide-eyed Ingenue . I never put the knock on Lana Turner because she 's so frankly Lana Turner . But this Leigh is no schoolgirl , regardless of how much she bats her eyes . After all , she 's been married a time or two . " He raised a sardonic eyebrow at me and said , Watch it , chum . Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' She 's a cushion-plumper at heart , a girl who wants to go back to North Carolina , marry some nice man and have a flock of babies . ' " His office seemed suddenly warm and stuffy . I thanked him for talking to me and started outside to cool off . Funny thing , I thought . You can always tell if a guy 's really a gentleman . If he 's not , sooner or later he gives himself away . Following me to the door , he said , " Take her ! nade-in-heaven ' marriage to Curtis . That marriage was made in Hollywood , and ' Any resemblance PHOTOGRAPHY BY GENE LESTER between Hollywood and heaven is purely coincidental . ' To slice it thinner , their marriage was made in spite of Hollywood . There was plenty of opposition to it from Tony 's studio . " I remembered a thing a producer friend  --  a man wise in Hollywood 's little ways  --  had once told me : " If you see a guy squirting venom at a woman star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or two when he tried to make like a great lover with her . " Nevertheless , that sardonically raised eyebrow shook me . Back in my hotel room , I took out the Janet Leigh notes I 'd made and reread them . Born in Merced , California . Sang in church choir and choral group in college . Real name Jeanette Morrison . Father 's name Fred . Mother 's name Helen . Moved to Stockton . Father owned electrical business . Badly hit by depression . Mother waited table to put daughter through high school and college . Eventually father wound up as accountant at Sugar Bowl Ski Lodge , Sugar Springs , California , near Lake Tahoe . Mother worked at lodge as receptionist . The Schwartzes get ready for work . There is only one bathroom in their Hollywood apartment . Story of Janet Leigh begins with an eight-by-ten-inch photograph printed on matted , soft-grained paper . To most people would have been just another photograph . Luckily for Janet , actress Norma Shearer is not " most people . " Shearer was vacationing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a photograph album on the table . Came across a picture of a girl in ski clothes . Paused abruptly . " That 's one of the most interesting faces I ever saw , " she said . " It ought to be in pictures . " Discovered the face belonged to the daughter of the lodge receptionist . On Shearer 's return to Hollywood , photograph went along with her . Carried it in her handbag , determined to show it to the first studio executive she met . Her chance came in Romanoff 's restaurant . Dining with several movie executives , waited until they had their desert . Then produced photograph . As a result , Janet was reached by a talent scout , asked if she would sign contract . She stammered , and was sick at her stomach because of nerves . Under the heading NAIVETE AND UNSOPHISTICATION , I had written : She seems a high-school senior walking around in a woman 's body ... a junior-miss Jane Russell . M-0-M was looking for a girl to play Van Johnson 's sweetheart in Romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who eat most of their meals out  --  have dinner at a drive-in in Beverly Hills , sided . All you have to do is carry a handkerchief up your sleeve . " Tony 's face turned purple . He rushed to the front office to threaten to break his contract if such a thing was in store . " Since than I 've been avoiding him , " said the jokester who 'd perpetrated the gag . " I hear he 's threatening to put the slug on me . " As of now , Tony gets so many fan letters that reading them himself is an impossibility ; a corps of secretaries handles that . But when they first began to arrive , he read them all . When they found that out , studio pranksters slipped an occasional phony letter in on him . Their favorite concoction read : " I want to ' adopt ' you . I 'm a grandmother , but I 'm still alluring . So far , I 've ' adopted ' a ballplayer and a soft-shoe dancer , but I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in ; you can have two evenings off a week . " In disappointed tones , one of these letter-writing pranksters told me , " It fell flat . Tony was n't surprised . Hollywood seems such a screwball place to him that when he read the note from the ' alluring grandma , ' he merely made his favorite remark about movieland , ' Man , this is crazy ? " ' The next step in my Leigh-Curtis research was dropping in to see them  --  with no studio security officer tagging along to make sure that they said the right things . Sunday breakfast seemed to me a good time . Neither of them had to show up at a studio on that day . And Sunday is a good day for catching people without either their theatrical or mental make-up on . A girl who chaperoned Janet on a personal-appearance tour set up the date for me . " But before you drop in to see them , " she said , " you ought to talk to somebody about Janet as the leading lady in Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Jerry and his wife are Tony and Janet 's closest friends . Jerry was Tony 's best man . When Jerry 's not working in a movie or a night club with Dean Martin , he gets nervous and jumpy . He figures that making a movie or two at home will use up his spare energy . He bought a sixteen-millimeter sound camera , five hundred rolls of sound film , a dolly , tracks for the dolly to run on and expensive lighting equipment . If you help on one of his pictures , you work like a dog . He uses five or six of his friends as a crew and he sends out a shooting call for eight o'clock in the morning . " The first film he shot was based on ' a story about two guys who try to smuggle a hernia across the border . ' In it , Jerry played a triple role . He was an outlaw , a Texas Ranger , an Indian . There was a scene in which Jerry , the Ranger , said to Jerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And Jerry , the outlaw , said reprovingly , ' Oh , so you 're anti-Seminole ? ' " That ought to give you a rough idea of the dialogue , " Janet 's ex-chaperon said to me . I told her it did . " Jerry 's second movie was what he called ' the psychological story of a guy who thought he was his own sister , " she told me . " His third picture would have been sensational , too , only he forgot to turn on the sound track . " I said I did n't think I needed to talk to anybody about Janet Leigh as the leading lady in the Jerry Lewis homemade productions . I 'd heard all I needed to know . At ten o'clock on the Sunday morning of my appointment with Janet and Tony , I arrived at the apartment house where they lived . I walked through a courtyard bordered with plants shoot ing out leaves the size of elephant ears veined with pink and pale green . I pushed a button beside their door , waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet the day before on an M-G-M lot in a scene opposite Peter Lawford . She 'd looked sleekly provocative then . Her make-up and her dress had seemed sprayed on with a paint gun . She was wearing a white piqu ? one-piece dress now . It was buttoned at the throat . There was no lipstick in evidence and she was bare-legged . Greeting me , she said , " Tony 's not up yet . You can help me with breakfast while we wait for him . " My part in helping with breakfast consisted of sitting on a combination kitchen chair-step ladder while I watched her bring out cooking utensils , shining new and copper-bottomed . " Wedding presents , " she said . There were things I wanted to talk to her about before Tony appeared . For instance , her previous marriage . " After my first year of college I married a boy named Stanley Reames , " she told me . " He was ridden by this big ambition to be a band leader , so we moved to Glendale and lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Ritz . We went into debt to pay Stanley 's band while they were rehearsing . In addition , there was the rental for rehearsal halls and the expense of cutting a couple of sample records . Finally we were down to eating on a dollar a day . " It was then that the photograph Miss Shearer had seen of me at the ski lodge paid off . Only that pay-off was n't the breeze you 've beard about . A lot 's been written about how I ' reached stardom via the miracle route . ' It was n't as dreamy as that . I was having a pretty awful time of it while the miracle took its time happening . " At M-G-M I 'd been shown a telegram from Norma Shearer describing her Janet Leigh discovery . The studio had asked Miss Shearer to recapitulate the story for the benefit of writers such as myself . The Shearer prose style can be summed up as " lyrical " or " ecstatic . " It is quite unlike the prose style of Ernest Hemingway . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN HER PICTURE A KIND OF WISTFULNESS COMBINED WITH A HOPE AND JOYOUSNESS THAT ONE ASSOCIATES WITH THE QUICK INTAKE OF A BREATH OR THE FEELING ONE MIGHT HAVE UPON SEEING A BEAUTIFUL SUNRISE . I FELT SHE BELONGED ON THE SCREEN SO TOOK HER PICTURE BACK WITH ME , THINKING M-G-M OR SOME OTHER STUDIO MIGHT BE GRATEFUL TO KNOW ABOUT HER AND THEY WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE A NEW LITTLE STAR FOR THE FUTURE . I TOOK HER PICTURE TO LUNCH WITH ME ONE DAY .... I GAVE IT TO MR . LEW WASSERMAI ? 1 AND TOLD HIM WHERE HE COULD REACH THE LITTLE LADY . A WEEK OR TWO LATER HE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME HE HAD GOT A CONTRACT FOR HER AT M.G.M. THEN A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARDS M-O.M CALLED ME AND TOLD ME WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TEST SHE HAD TAKEN AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN CHOSEN TO PLAY THE LEAD OPPOSITE MR . VAN JOHNSON IN ROMANCE OF ROSY RIDGE .... WHAT TOUCHED ME MOST WAS HER GRATITUDE AND SWEETNESS . I HOPE SHE ALWAYS KEEPS THAT BECAUSE THEN 1 AM SURE HER LITTLE FACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the address on the back of the picture was my Stockton one , " Janet continued , " they had a hard time finding me . Miss Shearer wrote me a letter , but it was returned to her marked ' Whereabouts of Addressee Unknown . ' Before the man she 'd shown my picture to located me , we 'd almost starved . " She broke eggs into a bowl , stirred them and said , " Two years later Stanley and I were divorced . " She did n't say , " Our marriage could n't stand my success and his hard time getting his band started . " Nor did she try to build character by saying , " After I was on contract I helped pay back some of the money we borrowed . " But I 'd heard that both were true . I 'd also heard that helping pay back the borrowed money had n't been easy . Playing the lead opposite Van Johnson does n't necessarily mean that a girl is immediately up in the chips . While that picture was being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast to Johnson 's $5000 a week . Nor does a successful debut in pictures mean that a neophyte actress automatically is given fat roles . As a result of her satisfactory work in The Romance of Rosy Ridge  --  although her salary was boosted to $150 a week , still no great shakes as Hollywood salaries go  --  in her second picture she played opposite Lassie , the dog star . I asked her how she felt about the remodeling job RKO had done on her screen personality . " I liked it , " she said , " with reservations . When an outside studio wants you , it makes your own studio think more of you . At Metro I 'd been frozen into a ' Little Janet ' groove . At RKO they treated me as an adult and I grew up fast . And " ? she chose her words carefully " after all , I 'm not unbuilt ; I learned to capitalize on my other assets . " She thought , however , RKO might have gone too far with the Jane Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not knocking sex , believe me , " she told me , " but I 'm still not what you could call a girl around town . I have to watch myself at parties . One drink and I 'm blind . In Hollywood everybody figures there 's an angle behind everything you do or say . Once , when I admitted I 'd never been to the Stork Club or to 21 , people jeered skeptically and said , ' Who do you think you 're fooling ? ' " Not that working for RKO was all deep-dish d  --  colletage and being photographed to look sultry . In Two Tickets to Broadway , she was required to dance and , having never learned ballroom or stage dancing , she started from scratch . In the completed film she blows about the sound stage like wind-driven dandelion fuzz . No camera recorded the agonized hours she spent sobbing in her dressing room because her feet throbbed like twin toothaches as she soaked them in soothing lotions . I mentioned a statement I 'd heard that between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tony , the Hollywood wolf pack had pursued her in full cry , their fangs gleaming . She had her own phrase to describe wolves : " Big operators . " " I do n't believe a girl has trouble with big operators unless she looks for it , " she said . " Some of my dates were hard to handle . If they were , I did n't go out with them again . That way I finessed the dangerous passes . " When I mentioned a producer widely known for his amorous conquests who had made her the object of an intensive campaign , she grew serious . " He 's a weird one , " she said . " Before I got him discouraged , I was almost a gibbering idiot . He once asked me to go sailing , but instead of heading for the dock where he kept his yacht , he started in the general direction of the mountains . I 'd never run up against a routine like his . He 'd say , ' It makes me feel all clean inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him unless mom and dad were along . That did it . " She poured the eggs into a skillet and said , " Let 's talk about Tony , for goodness ' sake ! He 's wild about shirts . He has forty-three of them , most of them with high-tab collars . But he 's stopping the high collars . Somebody told him they make him look like a con man . " Tony came out of the bedroom and kissed her . She made a little growling noise in her throat to indicate intense enjoyment . Still holding her in his arms , he eyed me over her shoulder and told me , " Love her like wild . " When he let go , she introduced me . Remarks I 'd heard about the Leigh-Curtis wedded bliss rattled around in the back of my head . I 'd asked an art director if he thought their marriage would last . He said thoughtfully , " A lot will depend upon whether it 's something they thought up themselves or whether it 's something they thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioningly . " A couple of Hollywood kids have a date , " he explained , " and the fan mags and the columnists hop on it and coo , ' They 're so beautiful together they ought to be together for always . ' Pretty soon the couple become fascinated with reading about their printed romance and try to live up to it . " There was still another slant . The girl who 'd arranged the breakfast date for me had given it to me . " Nothing 's really sure in this town , " she 'd told me . " However , you do n't do the things Janet does unless you 're trying to make your marriage work . When she and Tony come to see me , she sends up word , Mr. and Mrs. Bernie Schwartz calling , ' not ' Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis calling . ' I like that . " Watching Mr. and Mrs. Bernie Schwartz in the privacy of their apartment , I said that their marriage seemed to be getting along fine , in spite of what Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread into a toaster . " They told me if we went , through with it I 'd be all washed up , " he said . " They said I 'd be letting my dame fans down . So I said , O.K. , I 'll make my bucks another way . I 've a strong back and I can dig ditches . If all I 'm offering my fans is my curly hair and my fiat belly and letting them pretend I belong to them , I want to find it out quick . If that 's all there is to it , a lot of other people besides me ought to be doing good . ' " We sat down to scrambled eggs , toast , bacon and coffee . Between mouthfuls I asked Tony what had happened to him before U-I had brought him to Hollywood . " I was born in 1925 in New York 's Hell 's Kitchen , " he said . " I spent my childhood in the Bronx . My name is Bernard , but my momma calls me Berneleh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budapest . He turned to tailoring when he came to America and found he did n't speak enough English to hold a job acting . " The biggest man  --  he was big in more ways than one  --  in my family was my great-grandfather . He was a strong man in a Hungarian circus . He ( Continued on Page 80 ) ( Continued from Pane 78 ) stood seven feet eight inches tall in his socks . When he died they had to make a specially built coffin to hold him . " A settlement-house worker , Al Schwartz ? no relation ? had started Tony on his dramatic career . With a pal or two , Tony had been sent to the Henry Street Settlement . House to be " straightened out . " Schwartz suggested they stage a show for the other kids , and they 'd agreed . It was a play about King Arthur . In it Tony played a feminine role . Next day he stalked around Public School No. 82 , fists cocked , waiting for somebody to rib him about playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blazing eyes and decided there was no future in needling him . " I 'd have creamed them , " Tony told me grimly . Six months before he was duo to graduate from high school , he 'd joined the Navy . He served on a submarine , the Dragonet . While loading torpedoes at Guam , a winch chain struck his back . He lay in a hospital with his legs paralyzed for seven weeks . Cleaning up the last morsels of scrambled egg on his plate , he told me , " I might not have been in the movies at all if they 'd issued more movies to entertain the sub 's crew during one thirty-day war patrol . For that patrol we were allowed four beat-up old movies . Among them was Gunge Din , with Cary Grant . We ran that film so much that we were bored to death and ran it backwards for laughs . After that we memorized the speaking parts and ran it , without sound . We delivered the dialogue ourselves . " Four times Tony drew the Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " great " in it , he decided to be an actor . Which was why , when out of the Navy , he 'd gone to dramatic school . In his first Hollywood part , he 'd danced briefly with Yvonne de Carlo . His back had been to the camera most of the time . " Just the same , he began to get fan mail addressed to ' that cute fellow who danced with de Carlo , " Janet put in . " Then it happened , and man , it was crazy ! " Tony said . " All of a sudden I 'm two other guys . One of them is bewildered , the other is broke , but they 're both me . I go in for a haircut and I end up with a lot of stuff I do n't want  --  a massage , a manicure , a shine  --  and it sets me back five bucks . " He said that he used to risk a dollar or two on a hot tip on a horse , but that all the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him they 'd let him in on a good thing if he was willing to make a little $5000 investment . " When I tell them nuts , they go around beefing : ' I 'll bet that Curtis has still got the first buck he ever made ! ' " He said unhappily , " Now even my tailor 's giving me a bad time . He does n't have a thing he can make fit me for under $135 . " " He 's not the only one who has to be budget-conscious , " Janet told me . " Every month I get between 2000 and 3000 items of personal mail and requests for pictures . The studio does n't take care of my personal mail ; I have to pay my sister to handle it for me . Nor does the studio supply postage , and answering my fan mail costs me plenty for stamps alone . And half the clothes I own I would n't have to buy if I were n't a star . Fans are n't always nice about your personal life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , and when photographs of me came out in the fan magazines , my fans wrote in to ask , ' How come ? With the hundreds of thousands of dollars you must make , ca n't you buy a new dress ? " She said she did n't want me to give people the idea that she felt sorry for herself or was a whiner . " That would be pretty silly of me . This town can be both good and bad to folks like Tony and me , " she said . " It was bad when it tried to keep us from getting married . It was bad when the big operators tried to make me between marriages . But I 've got more money than I would have had anywhere else . I 've been able to help mom and dad be better off than they would ever have been . I 've been to New York and I 've met Rodgers and Hammerstein and I 've met Tony . I think it 's exciting to say hello to Van Johnson and Walter Pidgeon mornings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it , if anything good has happened to me , I did n't earn it . It was an accident . So I 'm grateful . So I do anything I 'm asked to do . " Tony brooded for a while , then said , " It 's not only the dough . Everything 's different now . I got people coining at me from all sides calling me Mr. Curtis instead of Tony or Bernie . " Before " it happened " to him , he 'd led Poppa and Momma Schwartz into a Universal-International projection room where his first film was being shown to a group of studio employees . Momma Schwartz bore boxes of cookies she 'd baked for the occasion . Poppa Schwartz carried ice cream and soft drinks . They had wanted to make it a homey affair for their son 's new friends . Everybody wolfed momma 's cookies and Tony beamed with pride . Being in that first film had n't just happened . He had n't reached in a thumb and pulled out that casting plum a la Jack Horner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , involving both sweat and blood . He dived over walls , leaped up to hang from railings by his hands , ended in the studio infirmary with the palms of his hands raw and one toe broken . When he got home that night his mother took a look at him and said , " Keep on like this and you wo n't be pretty any more . " Her remark struck him as so funny that it gave him enough energy to go to the telephone , dial a few friends and say , " I want you should hear this amusing thing momma just said . " Tony 's reminiscing was interrupted by the front-door buzzer . He went to the miniature phone connecting with the outer court , winked at me and spoke into it , " Commander to commander , have pilot and plane ready . Admiral Schwartz is taking off . " He pushed the button which released the lock and the door opened . A messenger with a startled expression on his face stood there . In his hand be bore a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away looking like a man who 'd made up his mind to have his hearing checked . Tony ripped the envelope open and pulled out two pages of yellow paper . Strips of paper ran crosswise on each page . He read the first page , handed it to Janet and ran his eyes over the second one . When she read it , too , she explained to me politely , " Sorry . We thought it might be something important . But it 's just an invitation to a cocktail party . " Tony stared at the pages in her hand , bewildered . " But I just saw the guy yesterday . Why did n't he ask us to his party then ? " Janet shrugged  --  meaning , " You know Hollywood . " When I said , " Good-by , " Tony was reading the telegram again . He was saying , " Man , it 's crazy ! "
