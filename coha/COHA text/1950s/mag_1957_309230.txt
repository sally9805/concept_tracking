While Americans were wondering just what to make of the anti-U.S . riots on Formosa last week , the press elsewhere around the world offered instant X rays by the dozen . From the propaganda potshots of Peking and Moscow to the emotional outbursts of Manila and Bangkok , few verdicts were favorable to the U.S. The most damaging to U.S. internationalism were the well-meant missiles of friends and allies that homed in on the very self-doubts that the violence had triggered in the U.S. press . <P> The Imperial Purple . In the Far East , where the press is still quick to smite down anything that seems to smack of colonialism ( and anything white men do is likely to be interpreted as colonial ) , newspapers were less concerned with the broad , strategic repercussions of the riots than with their ostensible cause : the acquittal by a U.S. court-martial of a G.I. charged with killing a Chinese . The extra- territorial privileges enjoyed by American citizens on Formosa are " unendurable , " said Singapore 's leading Chinese daily , anti-Communist Sin Chew Jit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agreed that this was " the root cause of trouble . " <P> In Japan , where anti-American sentiment has been fanned by the jurisdictional dispute over another G.I. who is charged with manslaughter , Hokkaido Shimbun said that the riots were " primarily attributable to American racial prejudice and superiority complex . " The usually pro-American Mainichi Shimbun exulted : " The incident proves an old saying : ' Even a worm one inch long is one-half inch of spirit . ' " In Bangkok the middle-of-the-road daily Satirapharp cautioned : " The incident on Formosa has taught us that we must not let too many Americans come to our country . " <P> More surprising , at a critical juncture in Washington 's debate over foreign aid , was the skepticism on the question of U.S. military and economic assistance in countries that reap only benefit from such programs . To the independent Times of India , the riots were " one more illustration of the truth that dollars can ensure neither appreciation nor loyalty . " Said the Times of Indonesia : " Having succeeded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States today has also inherited its concomitant-resentment , envy , and the readiness of others to take offense at the drop of a hat . It 's time for Washington to do some soul searching . " ( This , if put more charitably , comes close to a general U.S. reaction-the ruefully philosophical recognition that the U.S. is now a big power and therefore must expect to be kicked around as a matter of course. )
