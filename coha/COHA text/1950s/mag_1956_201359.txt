" To hold Tibet firmly , " goes an old Tibetan saying , " the conqueror must win Potala 's top floor . " Potala is the 500-ft. - high , 1,400-room Lhasa stronghold of the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's powerful temporal ruler , and the top floor is the Lama 's private residence . Since Red China " liberated " Tibet in 1951 , hundreds of Chinese officials have been popping in and out of Potala 's top floor , wooing the 21-year-old Dalai Lama with flattery and gifts ( among them : ten autos , a direct phone to Peking ) , and isolating him from his own countrymen . But despite his occasional public concurrences in their party line , they still do not trust him , remembering his flight to India when Red China marched into Tibet . The 18-year-old Panchen Lama , Tibet 's spiritual ruler , is more acquiescent , and the Red Chinese have tried to bolster his status at the expense of the Dalai Lama . <P> India 's Prime Minister Nehru recently invited both Lamas to visit New Delhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birth . Last week Nehru ruefully announced that the Lamas could not come . " India in May , " Red China had replied , " will be too hot for the Dalai and Panchen Lamas . " Besides , the two young rulers were " busy implementing Tibet 's constitutional reforms . " The Chinese indicated , however , that the Lamas would shortly be allowed to make a trip to cool , cool Moscow , where requests for help can safely be disregarded .
