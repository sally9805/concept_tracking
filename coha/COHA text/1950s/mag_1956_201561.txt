The U.S. lay beneath blue skies , benign and contented amid the pageant of the colorings of fall . Aspens turning gold flecked the dense green forests and bleak grey sides of the Rockies ; maples turning orange and red spread a magic fire across the dour woods of Minnesota ; dahlias glowed purple , pink and coral beside the dark-flowering plums in the gardens of Longview , Wash . By night , the pageant continued amid a blaze of lights of county fairs where Ferris wheels turned and hot dogs sizzled and barkers exhorted . <P> In two major cities last week-Brooklyn and Milwaukee-the season reached a roaring climax as the Dodgers and Braves fought it out for the National League pennant ( see SPORT ) . Such was the objection of Ebbets Field to Umpire Vic Delmore when he made a bad call on Catcher Campanella at second base that there came a revelation , to hear the New York Herald Tribune 's Columnist Red Smith tell it , " that at least 34,022 people in Brooklyn have white handkerchiefs , a fact previously unsuspected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the arrival there of Campaigner Adlai Stevenson to deliver a nationwide TV speech was all but ignored . <P> One day last week Stevenson took his stand amid the pageant and said : " The text of my lecture for tonight is ' Bread and Circuses . ' " He harked back to the way the declining Roman emperors had taken Rome 's mind off its troubles with gladiators and spectacles ; he was disturbed , he said , that the Republicans might be trying to fob off Eisenhower upon " a docile , complacent , carefree people all happily chanting ' Peace , Prosperity and Progress-ai n't it wonderful . ' " Candidate Stevenson obviously felt he had a point : little outward concern was shown by the nation as a whole for the problems of its parts ( in drought-dried Holton , Kans. last week 300 people prayed in the courthouse square for rain ) ; nor was there much patent concern for the maneuverings of Egypt 's President Nasser , or for the Communist huddles of Khrushchev and Tito beside the faraway Black Sea ( see FOREIGN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its crises with equanimity . <P> But if the candidates could take time out to see it , there was a point to the pageant engulfing them as they swept from city to town to farm : the U.S. , though waxing so prosperous as to create an image of a promised land , is nonetheless energized as never before by its electricity of change . Complacency is stifled in the roar of dozers driving thruways , of cranes lifting the beams for new skyscrapers , of furnaces belching out more steel , of rockets soaring to dizzy heights . Clearly there is in the U.S. of 1956 no lack of interest in the search for the New America . But if there seems to be little interest in it as an election-year issue , it is only because the search is constant and the U.S. is always new .
