One of the easiest ways to start an argument in the U.S. is to propose damming a river . Last week the fights over two big dam projects which have been through long controversies were settled . <P> Governors . Senators and Representatives of four Western states voted to drop the controversial Echo Park Dam from their plan to develop power resources on the upper Colorado River . Conservationists had opposed the plan , angrily pointing out that the Echo Park Dam would flood the Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado 's northwest corner . The four-state group now plans to push four other dams in a bill to be introduced in Congress next session . <P> FPC flashed the green light for construction of the Priest Rapids and Wanapum Dams on the Columbia River . They will be built by the Grant County ( Wash . ) Public Utility District , which had to fight objections of the state power commission before it could take on the job . The P.U.D. will share the $361 million cost of the Priest River Dam with the Federal Government , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership " policy .
