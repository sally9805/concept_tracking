Something new in oil contracts was announced last week in Bogot . Colombia 's government-owned oil company , Ecopetrol ( Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos ) , and a private U.S. oil firm , Cities Service Co. , agreed to share costs and profits in developing the promising El Carare area , a 2,200,000-acre tract near the Magdalena River 120 miles north of Bogot . <P> The contract provided that Ecopetrol will contribute a fourth of the capital investment and Colombia Cities Service Petroleum Corp . ( a local subsidiary ) the rest . The profits will be split in the same ratio . As is customary , the joint enterprise will pay a royalty to the government , as the owner of the underground oil . <P> Colombia is already a sizable oil producer , getting some 12% of its export earnings from sales of 32 million bbls. of crude a year . But over the years the risky Colombian oilfields have been good places to lose money as well as to make it , and hopeful 1950 oil decrees have attracted little new interest . Ecopetrol itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. company handed back a concession that had expired , and no other foreign firm wanted to take over . <P> Nevertheless , El Carare , surrounded by the fields that pump up much of the country 's oil , has always been a tempting gamble . Title litigation scared off the drillers until a recent court decision awarded the mineral rights to the government . Then Ecopetrol , unwilling to tackle the exploration alone , invited Cities Service to help .
