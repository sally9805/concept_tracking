Travel without politicking is more unthinkable to Harry Truman than a morning without a brisk walk . As if to prove it , he canceled his regular walk on his first bright , breezy morning in San Francisco last week to try to make peace among California 's demoralized , feuding Democrats . First he held court in his second-floor Fairmont Hotel suite for a procession of party leaders . Then he dropped down to the Fairmont 's soft-lighted Gold Room for a lunch of crabmeat cocktail and turkey breast , and a full-throated political stump speech to Democrats from eleven Western states , Hawaii and Alaska . <P> " You know , " he began , " it 's good to get together with a group of Democrats , especially an enthusiastic group like this . " But he stirred up little enthusiasm from the party faithful when he swung into his familiar campaign song about the " special interests , " " the special-privilege boys , " " the economic fossils , " " the pullbacks " and the " anti 's " who were crippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he tried out a retreaded New Deal slogan as a theme for the next election : " Are you better off today than you were in the last year of the Old Deal ? " <P> The Middle of the Ring . Undismayed , Harry Truman tried one more chord : " The Democratic Party has a duty to the country , and if I am not badly mistaken , the Democratic Party is going to keep right on carrying out that duty . " He paused for the ovation that did n't come . " Next year ! " he shouted . Still silence . " 1952 ! " Finally they got the idea , and the applause rolled out . <P> " You interrupted me , " said the President with a grin . " I do n't know who the Democratic candidates will be next year , but I do know this . . . They will fight for all the people . " This time the Democrats clapped and roared on cue . Said Navy Secretary Dan Kimball later : " There is no chance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring with his hat . " ( Said Harry Truman , when a reporter put the question next day : " It was n't my hat . It was n't my hat . " ) <P> That night he changed to a dark suit to open the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference . Next morning , he roared out of town aboard the Independence , bound for Kansas City . For the last hour of the trip , the big plane skimmed low over the newly flooded areas of the Kaw Valley in eastern Kansas . " It looks pretty bad , " the President remarked as he landed in his home state . He saw Bess , waiting . " I 'm as tired as I can be , " he sighed . <P> Stripes &; Bars . But he was wide awake and watchful the following day when he inspected the tragic destruction in the Armourdale , Argentine and Central Industrial districts of Kansas City , Kans. still sodden and stinking from the silt and wreckage of July 's flood . Later , with Missouri 's Governor Forrest Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal aid for thousands of homeless and impoverished flood victims . Then , before the Independence whisked him back to Washington , he was off to the dedication of a new armory in Kansas City , where he dropped a fascinating footnote to the Truman military career .
