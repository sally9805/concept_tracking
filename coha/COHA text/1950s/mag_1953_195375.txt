The Republican Party in California is divided into three factions . On top is the machine run by Senator William F. Knowland and Governor Earl Warren . In opposition are 1 ) a conservative wing led by Lieutenant Governor Goodwin J. ( " Goody " ) Knight ; 2 ) the Young Turks , who more or less look upon Richard Nixon as their leader . Nixonites and Knowland-Warrenites got especially sore at each other during last year 's presidential campaign . Never enthusiastic about Nixon 's vice-presidential candidacy , Warrenites failed to come to his support when the " Nixon fund " squall broke . Then , after the election , Knowland took over control of Republican patronage in California . Since then , Senate Republican Policy Chairman Knowland has channeled into federal jobs several Californians who are in the bad books of Nixon 's followers . <P> When Knowland last week recommended Laughlin E. Waters , chairman of the California Republican Party 's central committee , for appointment as U.S. attorney for Southern California , some California Republicans predicted a hot war between Nixonites and Knowlandites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of sitting on his hands during the campaign . But , both future presidential possibilities , Nixon and Knowland want to avoid an open break . Public squabbles would do neither man any good and might damage the Republican Party - not only in California but nationally . The two men stay on good terms outwardly , try to keep their rivalry behind the scenes as much as possible . At week 's end , as if to show that the Waters recommendation had created no hard feelings , Senator Knowland announced that he had recommended two California Republicans for appointment as customs collectors , " after consultation with Republican Party leaders in California and with Vice President Richard M. Nixon . "
