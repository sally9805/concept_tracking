TUNES OF GLORY ( 211 pp. ) - James Kennaway-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> <P> As anyone knows who has ever been blackjacked on the vulnerable emotions by a Highland piper , the Scots have a talent for misery second only to that of the Irish themselves . <P> This first novel by Scots Author James Kennaway is a tartan tragedy with comic and eerie overtones like drunken laughter heard through a mist and haunting as the sound of army boots on wet cobbles . <P> In icy barracks somewhere in Scotland 's dour landscape , a battalion of Highlanders is waging a pretty grim peace under the command of Colonel Jock Sinclair . <P> <P> Jock had bravely led the battalion in war , but barracks life is another matter . He is as full of guts , and as hard to take , as a haggis . He sows as much terror among his subalterns as he ever did among the enemy , and runs his mess on lines calculated to make dinner with the Macbeths and Banquo 's ghost seem like afternoon tea . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gutters of Glasgow , he is a figure of awe and almost superstitious regard to the kilted men who swill their usquebaugh and sweat to master pibrochs ( variations on bagpipe tunes ) . As he warms his " celebrated bottom " before the mess fire ( nothing , it should be said to satisfy Sassenach and U.S. curiosity , is worn beneath the kilt ) , it seems no harm can come to him . <P> The tragic flaw lies not in his character , but in the fact that he is only an " Acting Colonel . " The War Office sends a man named Basil Barrow from London to take over the battalion . A " poor wee laddie , " who is colder than Flora MacDonald , * he had spent the war in British intelligence . Which colonel will command the battalion-Jock or this Barrow boy ? Jock is handicapped not only by a mistress but a prim Presbyterian daughter named Morag who is in love with a corporal-piper . The newcomer makes the fatal mistake of issuing regulations on how the Highland officers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim and subtle as is proper to a race which could take its whisky along with the hard Knox of predestination . In the end , the reader will have learned something of the manners of nearly extinct fighting tribesmen-and the almost equally extinct art of tragedy in the novel . As the grand and grotesque Jock orders the pipe laments for his dead adversary , he cries to his brother officers the patriarchal clan key to the whole story : " I 'm bashed the now . Oh , my babies , take me home ! " <P> <P> * A heroine of the 1745 Jacobite uprising .
