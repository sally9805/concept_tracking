Zermatt is a street at the bottom of a valley floor . Some will see it as a greening valley of picturesque and beautiful Swiss scenery . Others as a street of challenge . // At one end of the street is the railroad station , the only way into the valley unless you board a mule . There are no cars because there is no road . And there is little likelihood of a road as long as the will of the Le Chemin-de-fer de Brigue-Vi ? ge and Zermatt be done . The B-V and Z has a railroad monopoly . It operates 28 miles of track which are level for the first seven miles , then rise 3,300 feet in the 21-mile stretch between Visp ( or Vi ? ge ) and Zermatt. // Leaning over the street like an overbearing personality is the lean , bare , bony , skyscraping , knee-melting bulk of the Matterhorn , a 14,780-foot rock pyramid that has brought a lingering death from exhaustion to a score who have climbed it too fast , killed well over a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breached its summit . Less than a hundred years ago mountain peasants had n't a doubt that it was the world 's highest mountain , the home of the spirits who dwelled in the ruins of some metaphysical city at the top of its wave-shaped peak . // Green meadows carpet the sloping valley sides , wall to wall . In season they take on patterns from the Alpine flowers that grow , blue and white and orange , among the reeds of deep green grass . A rushing river , the Mattervisp , trundles north through the village en route to the Rhone , which hurries into the east end of Lake Geneva , then eddies out the west end and surges underground through the Jura until it reappears in France , courses through Lyons and spills finally into the Mediterranean near Marseilles . // Down in the crease of the valley , left and right along the street , are the larchwood chalets toasted tan by the Alpine sun . Tucked away among them are some 2,425 beds set aside for visitors , far more than Zermatt needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although barmaids have done it , a 12-year-old girl did it , an 82-year-old Swiss achieved it , a cat managed it and 1,200 climbers make it every year , you do n't have to climb the Matterhorn to enjoy Zermatt . The first hotel was opened by Alexander Seiler , a Swiss soap salesman , in 1855 , 10 years before the mountain was conquered and in an era when its eventual ascent was deemed an impossibility . Seiler had come to visit his brother , the Abb ? , but he came away notably impressed with the tourists who visited the valley to pick mountain flowers and net butterflies , two of the more titillating endeavors of the day . // Seiler stayed for 60 years , became a close friend and confidant of the pioneers , a friend of the guides , a mourner of the Matterhorn 's dead . Today the Seiler interests own six hotels in and around the crags of the valley , comprising 665 beds . The chain is threatened only by the municipality of Zermatt which itself owns seven hotels and inns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mont Cervin , a gem of paneled d ? cor and advanced plumbing right in the center of town . It charges about $10 for a room with a view , a private bath and three meals a day . Seller 's Villa Margherita is small and exclusive , its Victoria old and Victorian , and its Monte Rosa , which dates from the first climbing days and adjoins Abb ? Seller 's original house , a favorite with climbers . // Like the commune , the Seilers operate a few small inns pasted up among the neighboring mountains which can be reached on foot or by daily mule train . One exception is the Riffelalp at 7,307 feet , which can also be reached by mountain railway , then by an Alpine tram which has one red car . // Among the commune 's hotels located at the comparatively sane altitude of 5,315 feet , which is to say the mid-town level of Zermatt , is the large and elegant Zermatterhof and the eminently chalet-Swiss Walliserhof . I like to think of the Zermatterhof as elegant because I bear an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with guests , newly acquired at the railroad station , careening through town , its tail-coated concierge standing on the lower step , hanging onto a pair of brass rails at the back door , supremely oblivious of a large herd of goats ambling and tinkling its way up the town 's single street . // No matter where you stay at night you will almost surely be able to come by the fruits of the Valais , a Swiss canton nearly one-fifth covered by glacial ice . On real estate not frosted over , the Valaisans produce some eminent wines , among them Montibeux and Fendant . On the soil that 's left they grow apricots and strawberries , dispatching a planeload of berries to England daily during the season . // At the slightest excuse , and sometimes with none at all , they will whip up a raclette , a dish made from a block of dry and aged Valaisan cheese you would think fire would n't melt . But it does , all right , and the melted part is stripped from the block , doused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the red pepper , I have come with hard experience to discover , is to increase the consumption of Valais wines . A man with a raclette on his plate , another waiting in the oven and a dedicated Valaisan at his elbow to shill , will shortly discover not only the potatoes are boiled . // As for the daylight hours , those who would merely gasp at a mountain from awe rather than exertion can take the Blauherd chair lift , a two-seater conveyance which will lift you sideways over the forests to the Sunnegga restaurant at the 7,500-foot level . Walks stretch in all directions . // One of the best trips in the Alps is the open-air Gornergrat Railway which from mid-December to early October ratchets its way in about half an hour to the 10,300-foot level . From the terrace of the small hotel , with its brightly colored chairs , tables and umbrellas , there is a fantastic , almost unreal view of the great peaks , the Monte Rosa , the Breithorn , the Dent Blanche and the Matterhorn itself lofting their rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who remain in Zermatt long enough for the Matterhorn to become a challenge , there are about a hundred accredited guides in Zermatt , and the price for conveying you up ( and , preferably , back ) over the usual route is about $35. // Climbers usually depart about noon of the first day , walk to the hut on the mountain shoulder in about five hours , then stay in the hut overnight  --  a matter of $5 for you and $2 for your guide . You spring for both . At dawn you head for the rocks , remembering the official brochure disseminated by the Swiss : " The Matterhorn is a favorite of mountain climbers ... stone slides , icy mountain slopes , storms , thunder and lightning increase the dangers of ascent considerably . " // It takes from four to five hours to reach the summit , another four or five hours to return . Filled with aches and elation , you will be reaching for a drink in Zermatt in the early evening hours of the second day . // Although 2,500 climbers scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one seriously considered climbing the mountain before 1860 . Fifteen tries were recorded in the four years that followed , most of them from the Italian side . One of the climbers was an English artist named Edward Whymper who , up to 1860 , had never really seen a sizable mountain . Commissioned by a London publisher to make sketches of some Alpine climbs , he caught the fever . // Half the recorded tries between 1861 and 1865 were made by him . On one exploratory trip he slipped on the Matterhorn . Later he was able to say this about it : " I whirled downwards in a series of bounds ... now over ice , now into rocks , each striking my head four or five times with increased force . The last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of 50 or 60 feet ... I struck the rocks , luckily , with the whole of my left side . They caught my clothes for a moment , and I fell back into the snow with motion arrested ... the crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell into the glacier told how narrow had been the escape . As it was , I fell nearly 200 feet in seven or eight bounds . The rocks could not be let go of for a moment and the blood was spurting out of more than 20 cuts ... and I vainly tried to close them with one hand , whilst holding on with the other . It was useless ; the blood jerked out in blinding jets at each pulsation . At last , in a moment of inspiration , I kicked out a big lump of snow , and stuck it as a plaster on my head ... then scrambling up , I got ... to a place of safety and fainted dead away . " // A week later Whymper was back on the mountain . And on July 13 , 1865 Whymper and a party of six climbed the Matterhorn . Their success ended in disaster when four of the seven fell to their death during the descent in one of the most famous of mountaineering tragedies . // For the thousand or more climbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the green valley of Zermatt  --  one out of four a woman , one out of many a child , one out of all an octogenarian  --  there are no trophies . The commune issues no certificates . For the climbers there is only that sense of inner satisfaction . And continued life .
