In San Francisco 's olden days , it was great sport to watch five or six blindfolded boxers climb into the ring and flail for all they were worth . In California last week , a similar sport was engaging the interest of fun-loving Democrats : the Republicans were flailing away at each other , and if they were not blindfolded , they at least seemed blind to the possibility that they were courting wholesale knockout . <P> There was Big Bill Knowland , U.S. Senate minority leader , campaigning in the gubernatorial Republican primaries , whacking away in behalf of a right-to-work law . There was G.O.P. Governor Goodwin J. Knight , campaigning for Knowland 's Senate seat , and counting heavily on his friends in Labor . There was San Francisco 's Republican Mayor George Christopher , Knight 's rival for the Senate nomination , swinging blindly away at Goodie , striking only at the soft underbelly of party unity . And there were a score or so of other Republican lesser office seekers who were doing their darndest to convince the electorate that , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-to-work . <P> Big Bill was not about to back down , although he is fully aware of the havoc around him . Only recently , when he offered to help fellow Republicans by campaigning for them in their districts , there was an embarrassing silence . And then , only last week , Knowland nervily turned up in Fresno to talk to the state C.I.O. convention on Political Education . Three hundred and fifty delegates sat on their hands as Big Bill earnestly offered the information that 1 ) he is not unfriendly to labor , and 2 ) he will do his best to further right-to-work laws for the benefit of what he calls " union democracy , " a state defined by labor leaders as something akin to union-busting . <P> " I 'd give anything , " sighed one top Republican leader last week , " if Bill had not picked up that right-to-work issue . President Eisenhower , Dick Nixon and Secretary of Labor Mitchell have all indicated varying degrees of disapproval of right-to-work laws , but we ca n't publicize that at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the opposite position . It 's a dilemma . " <P> As for Goodie Knight-the story was that the only thing Goodie has to fear is an endorsement from Fellow Republican Knowland.
