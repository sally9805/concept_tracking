txt Dignity coupled with conviction that his Beacon Hill administration has laid the groundwork for a better Massachusetts typifies the moderate-tempo reelection campaign of Governor Herter . While his quest for votes is covering wide areas in Massachusetts , his campaign drive , confined largely to the final four weeks before the Nov. 2 election , lacks the tenseness of those being conducted by some other major statewide candidates . It includes , like his Democratic opponent 's tours , trips through industrial plants , sidewalk handshaking , and rally appearances . He also is meeting as many voters in person as possible . But there is little or no direct " vote for me " plea to individual voters as he shakes their outstretched hands or pause to talk briefly to them . Banks on Record Rather , Governor Herter is counting on the known record of his administration to bring him a second two-year term . He tells his audience he seeks an opportunity to put more of his program into effect . He goes beyond mere reliance on his record in calling upon patty workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have more to fear from apathy than anything else . " he says . He has more than once expressed concern about the " contented voter , " one who is content with developments for the past two years and feels he does not need to go to the polls . He is thus appealing to party workers to " arouse your friends who may be contented and satisfied . " He is telling them , " We have a real fight on our hands . " Governor Herter points out frequently that he is the only Governor ever to be elected in Massachusetts with less than 36 per cent of the Boston vote . He stresses that he received only 30.8 per cent of the Boston vote in 1952 . " We are going to do better than that this year . But we still have a hard fight . " Small Towns Stressed AL the same time , ne stresses the importance of the small-town vote to GOP victories . In 1952 , he points out , he trailed former Governor Dever by 110,000 votes in communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns the Herter lead was 115,000 to give him his victory . So the problem , as Governor lierter sees it , is to make certain that the full vote turns out in the smaller communities and to build up Republican strength in the more populous areas . Like most of the other candidates , Governor Herter is seizing every opportunity to meet voters individually . For instance , during his four-day western Massachusetts swing . his small calvacade was swinging by the Montague Rod and Reel , manufacturer of fishing equipment . Outside , during their lunch hour , employees were in the midst of a tense horseshoe pitching tournament . Quietly the Governor swung out of his car and sat on the sidelines to watch the matches and talk with the onlookers . Finally . Representative John W. Heselton ( R ) of Massachusetts , a close Herter associate , seeking reelection in the First Congressional District , broke the Governor away , saying : " He would stay here all afternoon , if I would let him .

The favorable comments the Gregors voiced about the roadside rest areas and the beauty of Massachusetts ' fall foliage brought a happy Herter smile and a wish for an enjoyable Bay State visit for the Gregors . The Governor obviously enjoyed immensely leading the Orange High School band at Orange in the town square , where the townspeople lined the four sides of the square to greet the Governor . Not a hand did the Governor miss shaking as he walked around the area . As Governor he is attracting the eager attention of hundreds of autograph-hunting youngsters . The Governor has the boys and girls line up beside the car and he signs books and papers as fast as the youngsters hand them over . As much a feature of the Herter campaign as these typical homey touches is his continued stressing that the Republican team in the executive branch and the Legislature is responsible for the success of his program thus far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third in a photo-story series on candidates in gubernatorial and senatorial races in Massachusetts .
