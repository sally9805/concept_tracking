" Later he told reporters that " our concern is to get our people safely home . " Throughout the news conference , in response to questions , Mr. White repeatedly stated that there had been no offer of an exchange either officially or unofficially from the Chinese Communists . He said he could not anticipate what type of offer they might make and therefore could not say what might be done about it .
