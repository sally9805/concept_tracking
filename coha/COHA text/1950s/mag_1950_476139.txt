Cataclysm ? No To the Editors : It may be that " a cataclysm threatens California , " but surely not from the flood that Alfred M. Cooper predicted in Harper 's for April . Studies and surveys of the Colorado River delta region by geologists , geographers , ecologists , and engineers , instead of supporting , utterly refute the reasons that Mr. Cooper advanced to support his fantastic idea that the Gulf of California by breaking down its delta may soon inundate the enormously rich below-sealevel agricultural districts of southeastern California . This barrier is longer than Cooper contended and much higher ? about 40 rather than 15 feet . Neither in extent nor height has it been decreasing in historic time . Gulf water will not seep through to create a break . In some thousands of years , if there is a rise in sea-level of 15 feet or more , a thin sheet of salt water might flow over at the highest tides ( if a levee were not built ) , but there is no impending danger . The vast below-sea-level salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not exist there , but is separated from the delta and the valleys by mountain passes nowhere lower than 150 feet ; furthermore , it is now bone dry , save for one seep from hot springs and 7 or 8 water holes not over 10 feet across . Instead of having retreated northward 18 miles since Hoover Dam was built ; the head of the Gulf has scarcely changed since the survey of 1873-75 . The decrease in lower-river silt , due to settling behind the dams , will not lead to a rapid recession of the shore , for with little loss the alluvium merely shifts about in the river mouth and on the broad adjacent shoals ; instead of shelving almost at once to a depth of 1,000 feet , into which the soil eroded from the delta would drop , the whole upper part of the Gulf is shallow , reaching a depth of 1,000 feet only in a narrow strip more than 90 miles from the river mouth . The claim that engineers agree that the flood can be forestalled only by " an earthquake-proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for ( I ) the delta nowhere approaches that width and is only 14 miles wide at one place , ( 2 ) concrete construction would be unnecessary , and ( 3 ) the earthquake scare is unwarranted . The claim that Salton Sea was formed by seepage from the Gulf caused by an earthquake in 1904 bespeaks equal ignorance , for ( 1 ) there was no such seepage , ( 2 ) the water came from far up-river , ( 3 ) engineers say there was no local ' quake in 1904 , and ( 4 ) the time was 1905-07 . Though the cataclysm predicted by Mr. Cooper is not foreseeable and though the dangers stressed by him arc non-existent , the remote possibility remains that a great flood from the Colorado River may again swing across the delta to wreak incalculable loss of life and property . It behooves the American and Mexican authorities to make doubly sure that the river banks are adequately protected at all canal headings , that the present and future levees are kept in goad condition , with provision for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering precautions be taken , with a wide margin of safety , to forestall the danger of a disastrous flood . CARL L. HonRs The Scripps Institution of Oceanography La Jolla , Cal . To the Editors : The possibility of damage by the false alarm sounded by Mr. Alfred M. Cooper in his article " A Cata clysm Threatens California " is far greater than that of which he warns . Imagine the mental anguish of the unwary farmer of the Imperial Valley when he reads of this utterly unfounded fear . Harper 's Magazine , no less than Mr. Cooper , should be admonished for the publication of such undocumented material . The article is so laden with errors that it is a simple task to select a few for refutation . ( 1 ) The Laguna Salada is a salt basin situated west of the delta country and separated by the Cocopah Mountains . It is accessible to water only from the southern end , and can not imaginably cause flooding of the Imperial Valley . Furthermore , it has been dry since the early 1920's. ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a sad remains of the once great wave that it was . This writer observed it three years ago as a high tide at a point four miles above the mouth . It was then a gentle wave of some 18 to 24 inches in height . Tidal bores require the presence of two opposing forces : a vast stream discharge and a rapid and high tidal range . The high tidal range remains but the stream flow is now reduced , hence the consequent reduction in size of bore . ( 3 ) The tidal range at the north end of the Gulf of California is not the 30 feet reported , and never attains the astronomical she of 50 feet . The correct extreme range is 25 feet . It is here hoped that Harper 's will print the letters of correction which will certainly he received . By so doing it may repair the harm thus far created . Lours E. GUZMAN Department of Geography University of California Los Angeles , Cal . We have received a large number of other letters attacking the factual basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Hewes , LETTERS President of the Imperial Imgration District. , El Centro , California ; Randall Henderson , Editor of The Desert Magazine , Palm Desert , California ; J. P. O'F . Lynam of Los Angeles ; Mahlon I. Mathis of El Centro ; Martin R. Hubert ' , , professor of irrigation at the University of California ; and Everett M. Larson. engineer of the Bureau of Reclamation , Denver , Colorado . In general these critics are in accord with the points made by Mr. Hobbs , though there are a number of dis .. crepancies in their testimony . I 'd Rather Be Ike To the Editor : The article by Richard H. Rovere in the May Harper 's entitled " The second Eisenhower Boom " ... is not in accord with the facts . General Eisenhower is making a brilliant success as President of Columbia University . . . . The General is the most popular university president that I have ever known ; and students and faculty are thrilled by his presence on our campus and the part that lie takes in our activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most university presidents give . . . As Dr. Butler defined the task of the university president , lie confined it to Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . Both portfolios have been adequately assumed by the General ; he has done a first-class job ; and in addition has maintained his place as a national leader , greatly to the satisfaction of our university . . . . WILLIAM F. RUSSELL President , Teacher 's College New York , N. Y. To the Editor : I do not recall any statement that has caused more indignation in Columbia University circles than Mr. Rovere 's that " there is intense hostility toward him on the part of the majority of both faculty and student body . " Nothing could be further from the truth . . . . Only two criticisms have come to my ears . One is that he is too often absent from the university ; but no one has asserted that he has neglected to give ? .. general direction and co-ordination . . . The other criticism , coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently " demonstrated " when an eminent foreign guest was given an honorary degree , is that politically he is too conservative . But , as Mr. Rovere pointed out , no one as yet knows with any definiteness what Mr. Eisenhower 's political views are . THOMAS H. BRIGGS New York , N. Y. To the Editor : When will we Americans get over our juvenile eagerness to hand the highest office in the land to men whose accomplishments lie in other fields ? ... There are reasons ( mostly of the General 's making ) to believe that Eisenhower 's popularity has diminished considerably , but even if it has not , we need for the Presidency today a man of great political ability , proven political experience , and eagerness to serve in that office . As a Republican , I would not vote for General Eisenhower . GERALD HOLLIHAN New York , N. Y. Our Evident Bias To the Editor : D. W. Brogan 's article in the May Hat-per 's is the clearest , the best balanced , the most comprehensive and satisfying on " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy it suggested an expert tightrope walker crossing a yawning chasm on a swaying wire . . . . The Catholic takes his orders from Rome as the communist his from Moscow . The Protestant consoles himself with the conviction that he takes his orders from Heaven , notwithstanding those " orders " which have resulted in splitting the protesting elect into a multitude of factions . Jonathan Swift in one of his cynically savage moods wrote : " Most men have just enough religion ro hate their neighbors ; not enough to love them , " . , LABAN LUCY RICE Ware Neck , Va . To the Editor : You have ? with the current issue ? published two articles on the Catholic Church and the American scene . One was by a Catholic , the other by a former Catholic . While the latter does make some minor criticism of LETTERS the Catholic Church , the pro-Catholic bias is evident to the careful reader . When ? i wonder ? are we to have an article on the same subject which is representative of Protestanism ? ... MARTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. W. Brogan 's article does not present the truth . We , the Catholics , have the largest religious denomination in the country , and we do not fee ! inferior .... Anyone ? oho has attended a Catholic parochial school will tell you it teaches unity , honesty , and loyalty to our country . . . You will not find communist teachers ( who are the ones causing disunion ) in these schools , but it has been proved they are in public schools . GEORGETTE BOUDREAU Austin , Tex . To the Editor : . . . What disturbs me most is the total absence of this type of fair-mindedness in the nation 's religious press . ... I am bothered by the fact that outside the Church we seem to have more genuine Christian liberality than . . . What a curious situation when a secular magazine demonstrates a better type of religion than the accredited spokesmen . . . . ROYAL H. DAvis Bangor , Me . To the Editor : I have enjoyed reading Professor Brogan 's article , whose point of view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist 's aloofness from the tensions he describes fits them into a perspective , but to some extent unfits him to assess their force and direction . . . . So Icing as Americans believe that then fellow human beings are susceptible of change , of being brought to a different way of life and a different mode of belief , they will be incapable of attaining those " minor social arts " that manifest themselves in the resigned acceptance of other men as they are . . . . Anyway , to whom but a Britisher would it occur to lodge the issue of religious conflict in the sphere of good manners ? D. L. BouNnEn Los Angeles , Cal . What Lincoln Said To the Editor : In your May issue you published an important article by Albert A. Woldman entitled " Lincoln Never Said That . " . . . Such an article deserves wide circulation , but in his first sentence Mr. Wolchuan makes two highly dubious statements . He says Lincoln " never had a ghostwriter while he was alive . " . . . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a President of the United States , especially in wartime , is not able personally to write all the state documents and letters that his position requires . . . . John Hay wrote in 1866 to Lincoln 's law partner , William H. Herndon , a long letter in which he said : " He wrote very few letters . He did not read one in fifty that he received . At first we tried to bring them to his notice , but at last he gave the whole thing over to me , and signed without reading them the letters I wrote in his name . He wrote perhaps half a dozen a week himself ? not more . " . . . Also in his first sentence , Mr. Woldman refers to the Bixby letter as a Lincoln document , when there is at least as much evidence available to prove that this was one of the letters written by John Hay . . . . SHERMAN DAY WAKEFIELD New York , N. Y. To the Editor. - . . . How long and patiently we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Woldman to compile an entire book of Mr. Lincoln 's correct and complete statements with data concerning the time , place , and occasion they were made ? Such a book could and should become required reading for many politicians of all parties .... FRANCES H. ABBOTT Riverside , Ill . Theater Video To the Editor : Mr. John Houseman 's article in the May issue of Harper 's Magazine " Battle Over Television " ' is disappointing in its failure to treat seriously the new field of theater television . . . Theater television opens a vast LETTERS new potential of televised programs for exclusive theater consumption , so that the fascination of immediacy can supplement theater film attractions for the public 's interest and variety . Among the theater television vistas are the televising in thousands of theaters simultaneously of Broadway plays and openings , the Metropolitan opera , ballets , concert music recitals , outstanding sports and news events , top variety acts , educational items , and special television creations fitted to a theatrical pattern . From current count , it appears that there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and this is only the beginning . Instead of recognizing or merely stating some of the benefits from theater television , Mr. Houseman rather has utilized his space for describing a showman 's stunt based on home television programs in a single movie theater , which naturally leads to a humorous derision of new soft-drink parlors . This is not theater television , and I wonder whether Mr. Houseman realizes it . On the other hand , Mr. Houseman is thrilled by the prospect of having films televised in fifty million American homes on private television screens , and compares it with the relative few ? fourteen million or so ? theater customers for an average picture . Of course , the true comparison of current theater attendance is n't with fifty million homes , . . , but rather with the number of viewers who are likely to see a picture on home television . If the author will take the pains to study the research statistics on the number of radio listeners or television viewers who , on the average , hear or see a program at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home viewing audience for a single film program is likely to be less than 25 per cent of his oveiestimated fifty million homes . Furthermore , as Mr. Houseman seems to imply in his article , it is the economics which pretty much determine the basic entertainment forms . ... I am sure that it the author had inquired seriously into such economics , he might have devoted more serious thinking to theater television . NATHAN L. HALPERN New York , N. Y.
