In my room , the world is beyond my <P> understanding ; But when I walk I see that it consists <P> of three or four hills and a cloud . <P> <P> THOSE lines by the late Poet Wallace Stevens , Connecticut insuranceman , might have seemed sheer Mandarin to most of his clients-but not to a Chinese . Chinese painters ignore the iron bonds of perspective ( which imply a stationary viewer and make the picture frame a sort of window frame ) and strive instead for the stroller 's leisurely view . <P> Of all the Chinese landscapes in the U.S. , the Southern Sung scroll on exhibition this week at Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts is outstanding . This 12th century masterpiece tells the complex story of an ancient war that matters little . What does matter is the opportunity it gives to roam outside the body in a dream world of blue , green and gold , moving to the subtle , silk-smooth music of the painter 's brush . The almost full-scale detail opposite shows a typical climax in that music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's edge , a captain on a black horse prances into view , and a gnarled pine dips its obscuring wing . The detail further shows that Chinese scroll paintings can be enjoyed a little at a time , as was intended . Ideally , the viewer unrolled the scroll from his left hand , very slowly , while rolling it up again with his right . Thus the scroll should be read like music ( but from right to left ) , with its themes and counterthemes , its unexpected accents and climaxes . <P> Together the details of the scroll on the following pages reproduce about two-thirds of its 10-ft. length . It begins with a somber , gonglike flourish of pines . The long winding advance of the invading army is the main theme , announced by a menacing rush of pennants out of the mist . The peasant at the bridge is a contrasting grace note of peace . High above him the army has found a pass into southern lands , and now , serpentlike , it descends to the river . For a time its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island ; then it reappears behind another island whose barren rocks are as abrupt as a cymbal crash . The picture opens out , like a swelling andante , into the expanse of the lake , the welcoming bridge . Above , square black flags are a dancing arpeggio . Movement of eye and mind is brought to a massive stop at the looming palace gate .
