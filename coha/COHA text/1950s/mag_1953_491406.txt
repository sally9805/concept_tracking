MONTGOMERY STREET was atwitter . From Tucker'sJewelry Store at Sutter , past Belloc Freres , dealers in wonderful silken fabrics , and beyond the Ville de Paris , even as far as the post office at Stockton and Washington , there was buzzing and questioning and conjecture . For the moment , even the disaster of Sedan and the capture of the Emperor were forgotten . San Francisco had all but gone into mourning as news of this disaster crossed the ocean . Despair over the downfall of France had become a social fad in the city by the Golden Gate . But today the promenaders were smitten with a new sensation . Beautiful women , displaying on that famous promenade their charms enhanced by gowns from Paris , and adorned by jewels bestowed upon them by husbands who did not shrink from ostentation  --  or by fathers whose palms were still hard with calluses created by pick handles  --  clustered in bevies and chattered and speculated and quivered with curiosity . The promenade , deriving from ancient Spanish custom , was a fixed social function of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon  --  so boasted The Golden City newspaper  --  as many as two thousand of the city 's fairest , accompanied by French maids or exotic canines , permitted themselves to be ogled there . The ladies walked in one direction along the allotted route , the young bloods strolled in the opposite direction  --  two streams of humanity , one female , exhibiting its wares ; the other male , appraising the offerings . Not that the young women did not stare discreetly from under their jaunty parasols at the gentlemen in high silk hats , carrying ornately carved walking sticks , with legs encased in pantaloons so closely fitting that the irreverent , referred to them as tights . If , on ordinary Saturday afternoons , there were two thousand ladies on parade , on this Saturday afternoon there were two thousand and one . Exactly at the hour of three , a smart carriage stopped at the Sutter Street intersection , and there alighted from it two women , First emerged a sturdy , middle-aged person dressed in somber black , and evidently a duenna ; then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ravishing . " She was young and she was lithe , and she moved with a grace that should have been set to music . For a moment she stood peering , with serene self-possession , up the long , thronged reaches of Montgomery Street . Then she opened a small parasol and took her first step along the promenade . None would have believed that the expression of eager youth ? the lips slightly parted as if in innocent wonderment , the violet naivete of her widely opened eyes  --  was carefully studied and rehearsed . She was in the mode . A tiny beribboned bonnet rode her chestnut hair , done in that fashion known as the chignon , or waterfall . She walked with the Grecian bend , the latest thing in posture which made most women ridiculous , but , somehow , only accentuated her other perfections . It is difficult to see how this method of locomotion , which consisted in leaning the neck and upper part of the body forward and thrusting the posterior backward , should so have captivated the ladies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as newspapermen and tavern turtles , referred to this carriage as the colic stoop or the lame kangaroo . But no man could have applied these derogatory terms to this stranger who had invaded Montgomery Street , for even this absurd and awkward fashion could not detract from her grace and beauty . Now and again , the coyly tilting hoops which distended her skirt disclosed embroidered stockings , and shoes with extraordinarily high heels . The finishing touch to the perfection of her toilette was that upon the right hand she wore a mauve glove and upon the left hand a glove of pearl gray . The progress of this newcomer to the Montgomery Street parade did not attract attention until she had traversed the first block . By the time she reached the second block the spiked mustaches of the young bucks began to twitch ; before she had completed the third block , young ladies drew aside and let her pass in order that they might stare and appraise . Before the unknown , followed by her stolid duenna , reached the post office there was furor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the turning feet of thousands of social pedestrians as they reached the stylish extremity of the promenade and reversed direction . Young men ceased tapping on the pavement with canes and drew aside to stare openly , to ask one another ILLUSTRATED HI ' AMOS SEWELL who she could be and whence she came , and to comment upon her obvious perfections . Bevies of young ladies , bursting with curiosity , not guiltless of envy or of uttering in whispers appropriate innuendoes , paid the stranger the tribute of unfriendly stares . Completely self-possessed and seeming oblivious of everything but the afternoon sunshine , tripping along as if she were the sole promenader on the street , the stranger made her progress until she reached the customary end of the walk , and paused there on the correct spot before she turned to retrace her steps . If she was conscious of the stir she created , if she realized that she was the center of all eyes and that , in effect , she was walking between lines of silent , staring people , she exhibited no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she neither moved her eyes nor allowed the color of her cheeks to change . Not even the most ' knowing who watched her pass was able to identify her or supply one morsel of fact to satisfy burning curiosity . She continued on serenely , walking in loveliness , demure , the embodiment of what the adored French called beaute du diable , until she reached again the corner of Sutter . There , hovered over by the duenna , she re-entered her carriage and was whisked away . To sit without awkward display in a carriage with the legs caged in a multitude of hoops was no mean feat , but the stranger accomplished it . She leaned back and smiled contentedly . " Well , " said the duenna in a harsh , censorious voice , " you made a holy show of yourself . I hope you 're satisfied . " " Quite , " said her mistress contentedly . " Oh , quite satisfied . " They rode in silence until the carriage brought them to the corner of Powell and Sacramento streets , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray , the city 's leading undertaker , and continuing on to a small house three doors from the tall residence of banker F. L. A. Pioche with its mansard roof . It was not a pretentious house , but it was adequate and comfortable . They entered the house . The mistress went directly to her bedroom , where she divested herself of her finery , and presently was in her bath , attended by her dour companion , who peered down at her with disapproval . " A woman , " said the guttural voice , " that 's built like you he is sure to come to a bad end . " " I shall come , Hepsie , to the end I choose , " " Your pa , " Hephzibah said , " was a good , determined man . Your ma was flighty . You got your pa 's stubbornness and your ma 's flightiness . " " My father was strong . I inherit his strength . My mother was flighty . But she had a flair , Hepsie . She had charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hepsie , inherit from her too . I have her flair and her charm . " She closed her hand into a firm fist . " But I have cultivated sell-control . " " You 're vain as a peacock . " " Not vain , Hepsie . If a prospector finds ore , he takes it to an assayer to learn the truth about it . I 've been my own assayer . I 've not deceived myself about what is there . " She laughed . " I 've checked and rechecked until I know how much I 'll run to the ton . " Hephzibah moved about grumpily , pausing now and again to glower at her mistress . She delivered herself of a profundity . " It 's a small world , " she said impressively . " I saw a face this afternoon , but I could n't put a name to it . It just came to me . Had a farm in Hardin County . Near Elizabethtown . You would n't remember him . Name of Arnold  --  Philip Arnold . Went skyhootin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " Kentuckians do travel . " " Just goes to show haw plans can he upset , " Hephzibah said smugly . " How can this Philip Arnold upset any plans  --  especially my plans ? " Hephzibah snorted . " Here you pick out this city to come to . Because you figure nobody 'll know you . So as you can be mysterious . And what happens ? The first day you go out , there 's a man from Hardin County . Born within a couple miles of where you was born . " " Nonsense . I was a little girl when he went away . Do you think for a moment  --  if he were to see me , which is n't likely  --  that he would recognize in me pigtailed Anneke Villard ? Whom everybody called Annie ! Do n't be absurd , Hepsie . " Hephzibah 's manner was inclement , her square face discontented . " For a woman that talks as much as you do , " she said , " you 're teetotal close-mouthed . I let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never figured out why you picked this place instead , maybe , Boston or New York . " She sniffed . " And why was you so dead set on me ? " " Because , Hepsie , you look so formidable , and so respectable . A woman living alone is under suspicion . Especially " " Especially , " said Hephzibah , " if she looks so that every man that sees her hopes she hai n't respectable . " " Exactly , " said Anneke . " You are to be so strict and stern and grim that tongues wo n't wag . You are to watch over me , Hepsie . You are to discourage men and keep them away from me . " She smiled . " You 'll be able , my Hepsie , to do well for yourself . Foolish young men will try to bribe you  --  to buy information or favors . " " So what , ma'am ? " " Take the bribes , " Anneke said , " but give nothing in return . " She paused , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected San Francisco ? " " I 'd like to be told eoniethin ' . " " And you shall be told . Hepsie , in spite of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony , women are still women . So much of life is forbidden to us . We ca n't go out and prospect for a gold mine or a silver mine . " Her lovely face was saturnine . " But we can take ourselves to the spot where men are discovering gold mines and silver mines . That sort of prospecting is not forbidden to us . Here is where such men are to be found . " " It hai n't decent , " Hephzibah said sourly . Anneke did not retort to this . She was talking to Hephzibah only secondarily . Primarily she was consolidating her own thoughts and plans . " In the East , in Boston or New York , rich men have been rich a long time . Society is set and rigid and impregnable . I could go to those cities and do well if , as you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or money or introductions , I never could gain the entree . Here it is different . Men have become rich suddenly . Society has n't had time to set and become rigid . ( Continued on Page 74 ) THE DANGEROUS ANGEL ( COW . 41 from Page 18 ) There are no rules or taboos . If I am wise and if I am discreet , I can get myself accepted by the best people . " " And git yourself a wealthy husband . " " That is only one possibility , Hepsie . The railroad is here at last . San Francisco men are making their millions out of railroads . And it is only the commencement . Wealth is commencing to pour into this city from the Comstock Lode  --  and it is only the beginning . Men who become suddenly immensely wealthy do n't know what to do with it . They 're dazzled by it . They throw it away . They overdo luxury . They overdo everything . In the next few years you will see such spending as the world never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish in a few months  --  with luck and astuteness  --  what I could not accomplish in a lifetime in New York . " " What it boils down to , " Hephzihah said , " is that you reckon this is a good spot to he a connivin ' adventuress in . " The word arrested Anneke . Adventuress ! Was she , indeed , an adventuress , with all the obloquy that word connoted ? Was she an adventuress such as the authors of the paper-backed novels of the day delighted to depict ? Or was she a woman of initiative pursuing a proper career , and seeking , inside the circumscribed limits allotted to women , to realize upon her assets ? At what point did one cease to be properly ambitious and deserve the epithet " adventuress ? " Anneke pushed the consideration of this point out of her mind because it vexed her . " The first thing we must do Monday , " she said , " is to go to the hank and deposit . my draft . I shall not merely go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall ask an interview with the president . His name is William Chapman Ralston and he is an important man in the great . Bank of California . " " He wo n't be troubled by you , " Hephzibah said . Anneke nodded confidently . " Oh , Mr. Ralston will see me . He 's to he my entering wedge . I shall establish myself with him as a woman of means . I am very glad my father was a diligent and thrifty man . Because , Hepsie , a girl can have no better letter of introduction than a draft for twenty thousand dollars . It makes one respectable at once . It may even make one eligible . " " Then what do we do ? " " We do nothing . We remain a mystery . Banks are supposed to be confidential places . But word will get around that I 'm a woman of substance . We stand aloof . We make no effort . It is better to be sought after than to try to break one 's way in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall promenade again . . . Hepsie , will you go out and buy today 's newspapers ' ? " Hephzihah turned a rigid back and marched out of the room . In half an hour she returned with copies of The Alta California , the Chronicle and the Call . Anneke immersed herself in the news . She did not merely read , she studied . She fixed facts in her mind , and the names of personalities . She scrutinized the financial pages , but most particularly the columns , having to do with the activities of society . It was an essential part of her education . After she had dined , she returned to the journals and continued to read , missing no item , until she had mas tered their contents . Then she called Hephzibah , who assisted her retirement . With lights out , she lay for a time reviewing the events of the day and her plans for tomorrow . Then she slept dreamlessly , a half smile bending her lovely lips . She was content with the initial maneuver of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The material of her gown was a little darker than a pearl gray . Her gloves matched in color and her little bonnet wasconservative . It was her desire to create an impression of good taste and gentility and common sense . The rented , closed carriage  --  for she was not on public exhibition today  --  arrived at the door promptly at ten o'clock . With Hephzihah at her heels , Anneke tripped down the steps and took her seat in the vehicle , to he driven to the building occupied by the great Bank of California . Anneke had planned and mentally rehearsed her conduct during this first important encounter . She would be formal , reserved , businesslike  --  perhaps a trifle naive , in order to evoke the banker 's sympathy with her youth and inexperience . When the carriage stopped at its destination , Hephzibah got down and assisted her mistress to alight . Walking half a step ahead , Anneke entered the banking room and addressed a clerk . " Good morning , " she said . " Will you be so obliging as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview ? " The young man 's eyes widened as he raised them from his ledger ; he stared . flushed and stammered . Anneke smiled . " Will you say , " she added , " that it is in reference to a business matter ? " The clerk recovered somewhat from the impact of her beauty . " I will see if Mr. Ralston is available , " he answered , and walked toward the closed door of Mr. Ralston 's office , upon which he rapped discreetly . Upon being bidden to enter , he stepped within and closed the door behind him . " Well , Wilkins ? " asked Mr. Ralston . " Miss Anneke Villard requests an interview , sir . On a matter of business . " " Who , " Ralston asked , " is Miss Anneke Villard ' ? " " I do not know , sir . She is accompanied by a servant . She  --  she is very beautiful . " " Then , " Ralston said , " we must see her . By all means we must see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk retreated and returned to the waiting women . " Mr. Ralston will see you , ma'am , " he said . " I thank you , " Anneke said , and smiled again . They followed him to the door of the private office , where he stood on the threshold and announced , " Miss Anneke Villard , sir . " Ralston arose behind his desk and surveyed his visitors . " Will you be seated , Miss Villard ? How may I serve you ? " She advanced to the chair , aware that he was watching her with aroused interest . Hephzibah , as was correct , remained standing behind her mistress . " I wish to become a depositor in your bank , Mr. Ralston . " " Indeed . " He smiled . " Very complimentary . In what amount , Miss Villard ' ? " " Hephzibah , " Anneke said . The duenna opened a reticule and extracted an oblong of paper which she carried , and extended it to the hanker . He glanced at it and there was a slight alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deposit of a few hundred dollars , but here was a draft for twenty thousand dollars . " Before accepting a deposit of this size , Miss Villard , " he said , " it is necessary to ask a few questions . " Anneke guessed that it was curiosity rather than banking caution that prompted this statement , but she bowed gravely . " What do you want to know , Mr. Ralston ' ? " she asked . " I am not , " he said , " familiar with your name . Are you a resident of San Francisco ? " " It is my intention to become a resident , " she answered . " I have taken a house here and it is within the possibilities that I shall remain permanently . " " With your family , Miss Villard ' ? " " I have no family . I am recently orphaned . I left my home in Kentucky to absent myself from unhappy reminders . I am quite alone in the world , except for Hephzibah . I was born in Hardin County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was also the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln . " She paused an instant . " It seemed wise to those who advised me that I have available a reasonable sum in cash , for my immediate needs . Until I determine if I wish to make San Francisco my permanent home . " Her manner seemed to Ralston to indicate that there were other funds and properties , and that this draft under his eyes represented only a part of her substance , instead of her total wealth  --  as was , indeed , the case . " May I ask , Miss Villard , why you chose San Francisco ? It is far from your home . It required courage to remove yourself from familiar scenes and old friends to commence life again among strangers . What , I repeat , caused you to select San Francisco ? " It was a question that Anneke had hoped he would ask . " Because , " she said , " I wanted to leave the old , familiar world , and the things for which that old world stands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where things happen ; where there is newness , a new way of living and a new way of thinking . Because , sir , San Francisco is an exciting city . Because it seemed to me that great things are about to happen here which it will be wonderful to see . " He eyed her with heightened interest . Here was intelligence and personality , not mere youthful beauty . " You are eloquent , Miss Villard , " he said . " You embarrass me , Mr. Ralston . " " What great things do you see in store for our city ? " he asked , with genuine anticipation for her reply . " This city , " she said earnestly , " was born of adventure . Not by men who stayed at home and rusted , but by men who dared to cross a wild continent or sail dangerous oceans in search of gold . Some of those men have possessed the vision and the ability to accomplish what seemed impossible  --  to build a railroad across the mountains , through lands infested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort from the Atlantic to the Pacific . This , it seems to me , was a great adventure . Others have gone out to discover new , fabulously rich mines . The Comstock Lode . New men are becoming fabulously wealthy , and it will be interesting to see what they do with that great wealth ? what mistakes they will make and what fine things they will accomplish . " She lifted her head and widened her eyes . " I believe , Mr. Ralston , that San Francisco is about to witness the greatest spending era the world has ever known . And I want to see it . " She seemed , suddenly , to become aware of herself , to be embarrassed by self-consciousness . She bit her lips , flushed . " Oh , " she said unhappily , " what must you think of me ? To talk so to a stranger . To  --  to express such ideas , which must seem unmaidenly . " Mr. Ralston was staring at his desk top . Presently he raised his eyes , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Villard , " he said , " that you are a remarkable young lady . " He paused . " And what advantage , " he asked , " do you hope to derive from this ? " Her eyes met his in a level glance . " Such advantages , Mr. Ralston , " she answered , " as it is proper and decorous for a gentlewoman to derive . " " Well answered , " he said . " Well answered , indeed . Miss Villard , we shall be happy to accept you as one of our depositors . " He stood up to inform her that the interview was at an end , and walked around his desk to accompany her to the door . There he extended his hand . " It may even be , " he said , " that I can be of service to you in ways other than financial . " " I thank you , Mr. Ralston , " she said gravely . " You have been exceedingly gracious to an intruder . " Anneke preceded Hephzihah across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in teller 's cage or bookkeeping cubicle whose eyes did not follow her . For once she was unconscious of this tribute paid to her beauty , for her thoughts were turned inward . She was reviewing her interview with Mr. Ralston . She had made no mistakes ; she had created the impression she had planned to create . How successful she had been would he disclosed by the future . She was aroused to her present surroundings by the surprised exclamation of a masculine voice . " Why , Hepsie ! " it said . " Can it be Hepsie , so far from home ' ? " " It 's Hepsie , Phil Arnold , " Hephzibah said in no friendly tone . " What of it ? " " It 's a surprise , " Arnold said , not nonplused , " to see a Hardin County face so far from home . " " How 's your family ? " Hephzibah asked pointedly . " They do n't git to see much of you . " " They 're well and properly looked after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Slack . " Anneke could feel the man 's eyes , but she did not turn . She was annoyed , but not disconcerted by this recognition of her duenna . Arnold persisted . " Is it possible , Hepsie , that this is little Annie Villard ? Grown up to womanhood ? ... I hear your father passed away , Annie . " " Father is dead , " Anneke said , not encouragingly . ( CAmtinued MI Page 77 ) ( Continued From Page 7114 " I hear he left you well fixed , " Arnold maid . " Slack and I have done pretty well . We located a claim and sold it . I 've been working for the Diamond Drill Company here . " " Indeed ! " Anneke said . The man John Slack had not spoken , even to acknowledge his introduction . He was an expressionless man with cold eyes and narrow mouth ? bronzed , uncouth , hard-featured . Hedeplucked impatiently at Arnold 's sleeve . Hephzibah interposed her squat body implacably between Arnold and her mistress . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said grimly . She turned her back upon the pair , gripped Anneke 's arm and urged her toward the door . Anneke did not resist , but when they were out of earshot , she said reprovingly , " No need to be so brusque , Hepsie . " Hepsie only grunted . It required no astuteness to perceive that her regard for Arnold was not high . " Hepsie , " said Anneke , as they stood upon the sidewalk before the bank , " we will Walk a block or two and look in shop windows . Tell the carriage to follow us . " It was a lovely morning . The early fog had cleared away and the sun shone brightly down upon the streets still wet with last night 's rain . Vehicles splashed through puddles . The air was crisp . Anneke was conscious of exhilaration and the need for physical movement . She walked slowly to the right , pleased with herself and with the world . At the corner , a little crowd , laughing and applauding , was gathered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not ended some celebration that started the night before . He was haranguing the little mob  --  not maudlin but gay and reckless with overmuch stimulation . " Fellow citizens and tavern turtles , " he said oratorically . Anneke , unfamiliar with local argot , did not know that a " tavern turtle " meant , to San Franciscans , a drunken man lying in the mud of the streets before a saloon . " Fellow citizens and tavern turtles , " the young man repeated , " youth is fleeting and we should improve each shining hour . Listen , my friends , to the violins before age deafens your ears . I set you an example . Do 1 keep my nose to the grindstone or do I use it to sniff the nectar of the gods ? " He blinked and looked about him gravely . " That , " he said , " was very poetic . I made it tw myself . Today is my birthday . How many of you sober , industrious , slaving citizens have reason to celebrate your birthdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born ? I am starting a new political party , and its platform is : Celebrate your birthdays . We 'll make over the world into a place where everybody is glad that he was born . " His eyes , over the rim of the little crowd , saw Anneke . He paused and stared , and then pushed a way through his audience . " Do n't go away , " he said . " I 've more to say to you , but at the moment I have more important business . " Anneke paused before she attempted the crossing . At her feet was a shallow muddy puddle , and her eyes sought a way around it . But before she could lift her skirts , the young man was at her side , stripping of his coat of expensive make and fine fabric . " Madam , " he said loftily , " for this I have historic precedent . Supplied , if you do not know your history , by none ether than Sir Walter Raleigh . " To her astonishment and dismay , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood up , beaming upon her . " Cross dry shod , " he said . " Sir , " she said coldly , " you are absurd . You make me conspicuous . " " Madam , " he said , " nothing could make you more conspicuous than God and nature already have done . " Hephzibah shouldered him aside . " Go away , you drunk ! " she said furiously . " Drunk ? " He bowed , sweeping the pavement with his tall silk hat . " Drunk , indeed , But not with wine . " Anneke , embarrassed and furious , almost ran to the other side of the street . She signaled imperatively to her carriage , snatched open its door and stepped lithely into its protection . Hephzibah was at her heels . " Drive ! " Anneke commanded sharply . " Quickly ! " The coachman struck his horses and they lunged away . Anneke did not look back to see the young , coatless celebrant staring after her raptly . But her outraged ears could hear the laughter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said angrily . Hephzibah snorted . " Women like you , ma'am , had n't ought to be surprised if men make fools of themselves , drunk or sober . You make fools of men till some man comes along and makes a fool of you , to even things up . " " No man , " Anneke said , ' will ever make a fool of me . " " The surer you be of that , " Hephzibah said , the more certain it is to happen . " Anneke did not leave her house again that day . In the afternoon she slept a little and read a little and thought a great deal . The young man , standing beside his ruined coat in the puddle , intruded into her thoughts , and somehow , her fury subsided as her appreciation of the ridiculous asserted itself . She laughed softly , and then , as she reviewed the scene , she was not so certain he had been completely ridiculous . She wondered who he could be . It was impossible that she could guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home of William C. Ralston , president of the Bank of California .

And an orphan I 've an idea , my dear , that this Mies Villard may be a akeezicks . Anyhow , she 's smart as a whip . She 's a careful one . Has herself a duenna . A bit old-fashioned , that , but if my estimate of her is correct , there 's going to be no hen chatter about her . conduct .

However , what were you about to suggest ? " It must , " Ralston said , " be lonely for a girl so far from home in a strange city . " " And so , " she said , with humor in her fine eyes , " you would like to have me sponsor this lonely stranger in San Francisco . " " I 'm not suggesting anything so definite . But it would do no harm to look her over . Leave a card . If you think she wo n't do , then there 's an end to it . " Mrs. Ralston considered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said .

" " That this Miss Villard planned that you should do exactly as you have done . " " Nonsense , my dear ; nonsense . How could she have foreseen that I would even mention her to you ? " Mrs. Ralston smiled , but did not reply . " Very well , Will , " she said ; " leave it to me . It might as well be done in style . " This was the conversation Anneke Villard had hoped for . In the morning she was restless . She would not leave the house , but walked about from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look out upon the street . So much depended upon the success of her effort . If she failed , it would be necessary to find some other opening through which she could walk into the society life of San Francisco . She could not eat the luncheon that Hephzibah placed on the table for her . " No good to twitch and fidget , " Hephzihah said . " You 're gettin ' on my nerves , prowlin ' like a cat . " It was midafternoon when a carriage stopped before the door . Anneke watched avidly through the curtains . The coachman alighted , mounted the steps and rang the bell . " Hepsie  --  Hepsie , " Anneke said urgently , " go at once . " She heard the opening of the door , a man 's voice inquiring . " Miss Anneke Villard ? " it asked . " She lives here , " Hephzibah said . " A note from Mrs. William Ralston , " the coachman told her . " I am to wait for an answer , " ? Hephzihah came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anneke snatched it , tore it open and read its formal words : Mrs. William C. Ralston hopes that Miss Anneke Villard will overlook her failure to call in person . If M ism Villard will be so gracious , it will give pleasure to Mr , and Mrs. Ralston if she will accompany them to the French Ransom Fair to be held in Union Hall on ( he Twenty-first inst . The carriage will call for Miss Villard at eight-thirty P.M. A reply will be appreciated . Anneke read this stilted invitation , read it again , pirouetted girlishly and kissed Hephzibah on her leathery cheek . She ran to the escritoire and wrote in firm hand her answer , which Hephzibah carried to the waiting coachman . She had been right . The reasoning had been astute  --  the reasoning that had brought her to San Francisco instead of to any Eastern city . What had just happened would have been impossible in the set and fortified society ofNew York or Boston . Anneke 's eyes glowed . If she could weave her way skillfully amid the trampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped along , the future could be golden , indeed . I must watch every word , she told herself . I must guard every action . I must make no mistakes . She was in her twenty-second year . IT must not be thought that because of a certain naive ebullience and ostentation that San Francisco was lacking in its desire for culture , Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson had been listened to respectfully when he delivered a course of six meaningful lectures ; and Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had been heard in pleas for the emancipation of women . The city had applauded Adah Menken and Edwin Forrest , and had gone quite mad over The virtuosity of the little violinist , 78 Camilla Unto . It organized libraries and it bought paintings by the acre , some of them good . It held a Great Music Festival which included a chorus of fifteen hundred adult and three thousand childish voices , to say nothing of three hundred instrumentalists conducted by Mr. Rudolf Herold . For five days the eight thousand seats of the Pavilion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing room . Mayor Selby purchased the grand box for three thousand two hundred dollars , and to cap all , a drum was constructed dwarfing even the huge instrument beaten at the Boston Jubilee . It was eight feet in diameter and needed a four-foot drumstick . Even in the matter of drum heats , San Francisco was not going to be outdone by the effete East . The fair , organized by sympathizers with defeated France , was a triumph of ostentation rather than of art . Union Hall was embellished , though the cages of singing canaries which usually formed a part of such decorations were missing - possibly because such gay voices were not befitting an occasion expressing sympathy for a defeated nation . Tricolored shields flaunted the names of Corneille and Moliere and numerous other immortal Frenchmen , and there were wreaths from which black ribbons dangled . But the mood of the event was not melancholy when Anneke Villard arrived under the escort of Mr. and Mrs. Ralston . It was a gayer , more brilliant scene than Anneke ever before had witnessed , and involuntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . Mrs. Ralston 's sharp eyes saw the momentary expression upon Anneke 's face and smiled . She smiled again when Anneke swiftly recovered her self-possession and presented to the world a face at once dignified and eager and unimpressed , as if such events were to he enjoyed casually as accustomed experiences . " How lovely , " she said , and then , with a becoming expression of gravity , - Poor France ' " A handsome gentleman with Gallic features advanced with extended hand . " Miss Villard , " said Mrs. Ralston , " this is your neighbor , Mr. Pioche .... Miss Villard , " she explained , " has taken a house but a few doors from your own . " " How charming ! Our drab neighborhood needs beautifying , " he said graciously . " Mr. Pioche , " Mrs. Ralston continued , " has done much for us . But I think his greatest contribution has been teaching us how to eat . It is through his influence that many Parisian chefs have come to San Francisco to stay and improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anneke said , and gave him the brightest of smiles , " that one may judge a civilization by the way it serves its dinners . " " And I , " said Mr. Pioche , " assert that the highest test of any society is the beauty and grace of its young ladies . Our city will assay much higher in those attributes since Miss Villard has contributed her presence . I hope it is to be permanent . " " I should like nothing better , " Anneke said , " than to live here forever . " Pioche turned to Mr. and Mrs. Ralston . " I hope you will Firing Miss Villard to dine at my home , " he said . " Would next Wednesday be possible ? I am planning a trifling entertainment . " " We 'll be there , Francois , " said Mr. Ralston heartily . Mrs. Ralston 's eyes were quizzical as she glanced sidewise at Anneke . " I 'm sure Miss Villard is unengaged for that evening . " " You are very gracious to a stranger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anneke'a eyes followed his slender , graceful figure . Here indeed was a gentleman , she thought . " To be invited to dinner in Francois ' home , " Mrs. Ralston said , " is like being invested with San Francisco 's Order of the Garter . " Their progress into the hall was slow as friends and acquaintances greeted the Ralstons and Anneke was presented-Young men in evening finery deserted the booths and roulette table and fish pond as a whisper passed around the room that the mysterious young promenader of Montgomery Street was present , and under the wings , no less , of the Ralston . Anneke found herself the center of a vortex of fashionably dressed young bucks , and of older ones as well . One gentleman with fine shrewd eyes , shaven cheeks and whiskered chin was introduced as Asbury Harpending . He interested Anneke , though not as Pioche had done . His manner was bluff and hearty . He Paid no florid compliments , but speedily gave his attention to Ralston . " Will , " he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Rothschild . " He paused . His eyes lighted with enthusiasm . " Have you been looking into the matter of those South African diamond mines ' ? Fabulous ? We have gold and silver . We 've had our Sutter 's Creek and our Comstock . Do you know , Will , what I think our next great discovery will be ? , Diamonds , Will . And why not ? If Africa has them , why not the United States ' ? We have bigger gold mines , bigger silver mines . The next thing we hear will he that somebody has stumbled onto a bigger diamond field . " Ralston smiled and shrugged . " If you find it , Asbury , let me in on the ground floor . " " I 'll do just that , Will . I 'll do just that , " Harpending said , and moved away . " If , " Ralston said , " somebody convinced Asbury that the moon was made of green cheese , he 'd find a way to send an expedition to quarry it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt the girl 's slender figure stiffen , saw her lips compress and rich color flood her neck and cheeks . Oho , she said to herself , and looked about to find the cause of her protegee 's ? disturbance . She saw a tall young man , immaculately garbed , with a face not handsome but attractive in a restless , reckless sort of manner . He carried himself jauntily , as if every step was a pleasure , and his eyes were alight with mischief . " Good evening , Mrs. Ralston , " he said , as one certain of a friendly reception . " You outshine the stars . " " Middle-aged stars , Juan , " she said . " What brings you to so tame an entertainment ' ? I hear-all San Francisco heard - that you celebrated a birthday . " He was not ashamed . He grinned boyishly . " And did I celebrate ! What else are birthdays for ' ? And mind you , Mrs. Ralston , this time the police did n't interfere . " " I ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan , why ca n't you behave yourself ? Your grandfather would turn over in his grave . " " I doubt it , ma'am . He was no mean celebrator himself. - He had not so much as glanced at Anneke , but now he turned his eyes upon her and waited pointedly . 1850 Diversey Parkway , Chicago 14 , Illinois duced him to lead them to the place where he had picked up the gems . It was in a remote and dangerous locality . Cooper gathered that Arnold and his partner killed the Indian to preserve the secret . He examined the stones they brought back , and says the rubies were nothing but desert garnets . He was dubious about the so-called diamonds . " He laughed . " Anyhow , this lunatic came here to find somebody to finance this mirage of a Golconda . " Ralston chuckled . " Better send them to Asbury Harpending , " he said . " He 's their man . Asbury 's made up his mind that our next great discovery will be diamond fields to rival South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her custom to listen and to store up in her astute mind whatever she overheard . The name Arnold had an impact . It could be  --  indeed , it must be ? that Philip Arnold from Hardin County who had accosted Hephzibah in the bank and had endeavored to ingratiate himself with herself . Of him , from her childhood , she remembered little , but Hephzibah bad made it clear that she disliked and distrusted the man . For an instant she thought of telling Mr. Ralston of the encounter , but checked herself . It would not he to her credit to confess acquaintance with this mad prospector . She did not speak , but as she remembered that brief encounter and recalled Arnold 's face , his shrewd , stealthy eyes , she differed with the judgment of the two gentleman . Whatever else Philip Arnold might be , he was not insane . Chris Andres ' band , without which no large social function seemed able to proceed , was playing that song which had become a craze from coast to coast , Shew ! Fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced to it , and it even crossed the ocean to he translated into foreign tongues . Energetic manufacturers produced and sold to a public ready for any fad Shew Fly hats and ties and shirts and jewelry ad nauseam . " If I hear that tune just once more , " Mrs. Ralston said , " I shall go mad .... My dear , it is well past midnight . Have you had enough of this melee ? " " It has been wonderful , " Anneke said . " It could n't have been more wonderful . But I think I am tired . " She could have stayed on forever enjoying the excitement , the movement , the color of it , but she was too astute to show disappointment that the evening was at an end . In the carriage she sank back upon the seat and sighed luxuriously . Mr. Ralston was pleased ; he was jocular . " I think , my dear , " he said to his wife , " that we could have made a great deal of money for prostrate France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell smiles for a dollar apiece . " " Do n't turn the child 's head , " Mrs. Ralston reproved , and then , touching Anneke 's hand lightly , " but it was quite a triumph for you , Miss Villard . " " Everyone was most kind , " Anneke said modestly . " I 'm sure I would not have been noticed if I had not been with you and Mr. Ralston . " The carriage halted before the door of her little house and Mr. Ralston escorted her up the steps and waited until Hephzibah answered the bell . She said good night and added a final word of thanks . When the door closed behind her , she threw her arms around the drowsy duenna . " Oh , Hepsie , " she cried , " it could n't have been better . I met everyone  --  everyone ! I was admired , Hepsie . It 's wonderful to be admired . " She stood still and her eyes became intent and determined . " All will go well now  --  if I THE SATURDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fists . " I shall make no mistakes , " she said firmly . " No mistakes . " If Hephzibah was proud of her young mistress , she did not betray it . - Miss Anneke , " she said harshly , " you 're a conniving piece . No good will come of it . " It was two mornings later when Anneke received unexpected and unwelcome callers . Hephzibah came into the little parlor to announce that Philip Arnold , of Hardin County , Kentucky , was at the door with another man , asking to see Miss Villard . " Better send them packing , " Hephzibah said inhospitably . " Better not have no truck with him . " Anneke narrowed her eyes . " It can do no harm to receive them , " she said . " It is always best not to make an unnecessary enemy . " Hephzibah ushered the men , roughly clad , burned almost black by the sun of the desert , into the room , and then determinedly stood erect and forbidding beside the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anneke , " you 've made quite a stir in San Francisco . " " What 's it to you , Phil Arnold ? " Hephzibah demanded . " Hepsie ! " Anneke reproved . And then , " Was there a special purpose in this call , Mr. Arnold ? " " None whatever , " , he said , and paused to present his companion . " My partner , John Slack , " he said . Slack did not smile , did not speak . He merely jerked his head . " No purpose whatever except that it seemed proper for one former resident of Hardin County to call upon another . " " Phil Arnold , " interjected Hephzibah , " do n't do nothin ' without a purpose back of it . " " Hepsie ! " Anneke said again . " These gentlemen are our guests ! " Hephzibah sniffed and watched Arnold with black , beady , unfriendly eyes . Anneke saw fit to be reserved but gracious . " You have been prospecting in the desert , Mr. Arnold . " EVEN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair to which Anneke had waved him . " It 's no secret . It will be no secret . I have made a discovery , Annie , a tremendous discovery . I 'm confident it will rival the diamond fields of South Africa . " " Indeed ! " Anneke exclaimed . " And where is this Golconda ' ? " " Now , Annie , you could n't expect me to divulge that . It 's our secret . It must remain our secret until I 've financed the discovery . And that 's not easy . Men are hard to convince . But they 'll be convinced . I went to call on a man named Asbury Harpending , offering him untold wealth in return for a few dollars . And what did this gentleman say to me ? He told me to go back and return with better proof of the value of what we found . " He paused and shrugged . " What better proof could he ask ? Have you ever seen an uncut diamond , Annie ? " " Never . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied on his palm a number of objects resembling pebbles . ' ? There you are , " he said . " Diamonds and rubies . Some garnets , to be sure . We risked our lives to find them , and here they are . But Harpending would n't believe even this . " " Those dull pebbles are precious stones ' ? " Anneke asked incredulously . " They are indeed , as any competent lapidary will tell you . " He returned the poke to his pocket . " Well , it only means that Slack and I must return to the Indian country and risk our lives again . I fail to see how a bushel of stones is better proof than a pint . " He changed the subject . " I was grieved to hear of the death of your father , Annie , " he said . " Thank you for your sympathy , Mr. Arnold , " Anneke replied . " The old neighbors , " he said , " are good friends . I miss them . Someday I mean to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . " " After , " Hephzibah the irrepressible said sourly , " you 've finished up this swindle and robbed folks of enough to live on . " January 31. 1953 " If this is a swindle , Hepeie , " Arnold said indulgently , " then King Solomon 's mines were a mirage . " He arose . " This was merely a call of courtesy . I hope your new life in San Francisco will be happy . " He walked to the door , followed by his silent companion , and Hephzibah grimly showed them to the street . " Now what was that fur ? " she asked when she returned to the parlor . Anneke was puzzled . The visit had been so purposeless . It might have been , as Arnold said , merely a call by one transplanted Kentuckian upon another . But , somehow , that seemed inadequate . " I kept my eyes on him to see he did n't steal nothing , " Hephzibah said , " or that partner of hisn . What you suppose he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head forward and stared at the floor . " He dropped one of them pebbles , " she said , and picked it up . Anneke took it into her fingers and peered at it . A rough diamond ? A diamond from the desert of America where gems never before had been found ? It was so dull and commonplace . " Call Mr. Arnold before he gets away , " Anneke said , " and return it to him . " Hephzibah hurried to the door , but when she looked down the street , both Arnold and his companion had vanished . " If that there 's a diamond , " Hepliz ? bah said , " then I 'm a Sioux Injun with feathers on my head . " " All the same , " Anneke said thoughtfully , " it might be fun to find out . " That afternoon , Anneke , guarded jealously by Hephzibah , went shopping . Among other shops she visited Tucker 's Jewelry Story on Sutter Street . The clerk behind the showcase , within which a rich profusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anneke produced the pebble Arnold had dropped , and placed it on the glass . " I wonder , " she said " if you have anyone here who can tell me what this may be ? " " I shall be delighted to find out , " the clerk assured her . He was absent for a considerable time . When he returned he showed some excitement . " Ma'am , " he told her , " our expert in precious stones is certain that this is an uncut diamond . " " Indeed ! Did he place any estimate upon its value ? " " He said it was difficult to appraise the value of an uncut gem , but in his opinion it is worth between a hundred and two hundred dollars . " " I thank you . Is there a charge for this information ? " " We are delighted to be of service to madam , " the clerk assured her . Anneke was thoughtful as she walked out of the store . Then there was truth in Philip Arnold 's fantastic story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter to be examined carefully . A diamond worth possibly two hundred dollars . Then another thought , prompted by caution , invaded her mind . Why had Philip Arnold left it lying on her floor ? Had it been by accident or by design ? If by design , what was the purpose of it ? Anneke compressed her lips . Make no mistakes , Anneke , she said to herself . Then she moved her lovely head sidewise , and peered down at the pebble in her palm . But , she added , overlook no opportunities .
