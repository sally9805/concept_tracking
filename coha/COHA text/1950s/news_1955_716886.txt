txt ? The Indian Communist party has taken a drubbing at the polls in the state of Andhra . It has been left politically crippled and publicly rejected in a state that has been a Communist stronghold . The results of the hardestfought elections in independent India 's history show that a. coalition led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's Congress party is piling up a landslide majority . The heavy vote in favor of the coalition has stunned the Communists and has come as a shock even to Congress party leaders . Late tonight , with more than a third of the vote counted , the three-party coalition had won fifty-seven seats in the State Legislature , the Independents had taken eleven , the Praja Socialist party had won five and the Communists were bringing up the rear with four . Communist leaders in New Delhi tonight said that their candidates were being routed in normally Communist districts and that the returns still to come could not change the picture of a heavy Congress party majority in the new Legislature . Left Without . a Voice ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andhra Legislature we were almost as strong as the Congress party , In fact , we were dictating terms . Now our party , in effect , has been left without a voice . " Ao Nambiar , Communist member of India 's , kiwer house , said that the results so far were " impossible . " He said the only way the Communists could have lost so heavily was by crooked poll-counting . It was believed in New Delhi that the Communists would open a drive in the national Parliament and in the Communist press to attribute their defeat in Andhra to fraud at the polls . The elections took place on five polling days last month and the counting began yesterday . The election boxes have been under police guard but the Communists indicated tonight that they would charge that stuffed boxes were substituted en route to the counting stations . The 11,000,000 voters in Andhra have been choosing a legislature of 196 seats . In the old Legislature of 140 , the Communists held forty-five and the Congress party forty-six . The Communists were so strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists , in November , 1954 , were able to topple the . Andhra state government and force new elections . On the basis of the results so far , a Communist politician predicted that the coalition , led by the Congress party , would get about 150 seats in the new legislature . The results so far show that the Communist opposition leader in Andhra , T. Nagi Reddi , has been defeated and so has his deputy , M. Hanmantha Rao . There are more fragments that add up to a Communist debacle . In the . normally Communist town of Vijayawada the Communists once held two seats ; tonight they hold none . Badava Punniaha , member of upper House of the Indian Par , liament and an official of the Central Committee of the Communist party , sent into the election fight for his prestige value , has - been defeated . Politicians agreed tonight that one big reason for the Communist ' defeat was the formation of the anti-Communist coalition , a move strongly supported by Mr. Nehru . ? Joining with the Congress party were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to split the vote by putting up opposing candidates . United , they routed the Communists . The Communists and the Congress party put a great amount of prestige , money and organitional talent into the fight for Andhra , a tropical state where political passions run high and violent . Mr. Nehru himself toured the state and urged the people to reject the Communists . His lieutenants then ran an even more bitterly anti-Communist campaign in Andhra , telling the people that the security of the whole country , as well as the future of their own state , was up for decision . The election results do not yet indicate the relative showings made by the three parties in the anti-Communist coalition . But the leaders of the Congress party are hoping that the Andhra results will revitalize the party throughout the country , They hope , too , that the Andhra election will weaken the Communists in other parts of South India where the Communists have been making a concentrated attempt to carve out a political belt . i         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
