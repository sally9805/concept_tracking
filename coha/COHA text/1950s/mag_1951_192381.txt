Captain Eddie Rickenbacker , lifelong specialist in the calculated risk , last week staked $100 million on the future of his Eastern Air Lines . He signed final contracts for that much in new airplanes for Eastern , the largest replacement order in U.S. aviation history . The orders were for 30 four-engined Lockheed Super-Constellations and 60 twin-engined Martin 4-0-4s . They will add an average of 65 m.p.h. to the speed of the Eastern fleet and will boost passenger capacity by 175% . <P> The Super-Connies are 18.4 feet longer than present ones , will carry 88 passengers instead of 60 , have a 40% bigger payload . The first planes , which will go to Eastern in three months , will cruise at 319 m.p.h . Later models , with new 3,250-h.p . Wright engines , will cruise at 350 m.p.h . <P> The 280-m.p.h. , 40-passenger Martins will replace Eastern 's slower 21-passenger DC-3 fleet , will be used on short hauls beginning in December . <P> When all deliveries are made , Eddie Rickenbacker estimates that his big fleet will boost Eastern 's traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , to $160 million by 1953 . With that much money coming in , Captain Eddie , who is borrowing $30 million from banks for his new planes , expects to pay most of it back , plus the other $70 million , out of earnings . And he does n't intend to lose money selling his old planes . Demand for secondhand transports is so heavy that the canny captain thinks he can sell them off for 75% of their original cost .
