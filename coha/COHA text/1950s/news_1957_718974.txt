txt The Liberal party designated Mayor . Wagner , Council President Abe Stark and Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa for re-election last night . The Democratic city - wide slate was endorsed by a vote of 280 to 23 , with strong leadership backing . Previously the city convention had been told , that Mayor Wagner , " if nominated and elected , will serve out his full four years . " That assurance was conveyed to the convention at the Astor Hotel by Alex Rose , Liberal party vice chairman , who said he had gotten the word on " very good authority . " Senate Race Seen Out The information would seem to preclude another Senate race by Mr. Wagner in 1958 . He lost his Senate bid last year . Since the Council President takes over if the mayoralty is vacated , Mr. Stark 's fitness for the post be'came an issue in the 1956 Senate race . The Rose statement , originally intended to ease opposition to Mr. Stark , actually was presented after unorganized forces at the convention had turned on Mr. Wagner rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raising taxes , increasing payrolls and overconfidence in the face of " a stench of corruption within his administration . " ( , One delegate , Myra Barnes of Richmond , a perennial witness at City Hall hearings , suggested that the Liberals should be nominating Mr. Stark instead of Mr , Wagner for Mayor . " He at least is on the job at City Hall , " she said . Rose Defends Wagner After four such speeches , Mr. Rose defended the Mayor as , one who " gives a liberal interpretation to the needs of the people , " and who at the same time was honest . He contended there was " nothing wrong with coalition even if we have to compromise from time to time . " . Neither Mr. Wagner nor any of his running mates was endorsed by the Liberal party in 1953 when the Liberals , running their own ticket headed by Rudolph Halley , polled 428,000 votes . Mr. Wagner received 1,022,000 . The convention 's endorsement of the Wagner ticket last - night followed a unanimous recommendation by the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vacation and could not be polled . Earlier in the evening , the New York County Committee designated Manhattan Borough President Hulan E. Jack , a Democrat , for re-election . ? He , too , had been opposed by the party when first ' elected in 1953 . Republicans had sounded out the ' Liberals on the possibility // of a coalition against Mr. Jack . Last week the Republicans nominated Melvin L. Krulewitch . Mr. Rose also said it would be " entirely immaterial and unfair to consider Mr. Stark as anything but a candidate for Council President . " As such , he said , the Liberals considered Mr. Stark as " part of the Wagner Administration in which we have confidence . " He conceded that there were some Liberals who " thought Caroline Simon would be a very attractive candidate . " Mrs. Simon is the Republican candidate for Council President and the I first woman to be nominated by a major party for city-wide office . She is a former member of the State Commission Against Discrimination . However , Mr. Rose said others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " the second-most-important person on a very ineffective commission . " He said the policy committee , in asking endorsement of the full Democratic slate , " meant to express confidence in the Wagner Administration and hope and prayer that it would be more successful . " " Better ? " he was asked . " More successful , " he repeated , explaining that " in the realm where the Mayor makes the decisions ? on big appointments that get his personal attention ? he has shown good judgment and a large measure of independence . " He added that appointments that " proceed through channels on the basis of organization recommendation fall short of Wagner standards . " " Do you refer to the influence of Carmine De Sapio ? " he was asked . " No , " he replied , " I make no such statement . I merely refer to some undersirable individuals who are unloaded on the administration . " As examples of the Mayor 's independence , Mr. Rose cited Mr. Wagner 's support last year of Adlai E. Stevenson for the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mayor 's opposition to state court reform , where he stepped on toes of a lot of hopefuls. "
