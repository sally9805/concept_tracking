When heavy cigarette smoking was first indicted as the major cause of the radical increase in lung cancer , scarcely more than 1% of cigarettes had filter tips . Today at least 40% have them , and tobacco experts expect the figure soon to hit 75% . But do the filters help ? Up to now . the cynical answer has been that they help to sell cigarettes , and nothing more . Last week a congressional committee* opened an investigation of cigarette filters , for which the public pays a premium of $500,000 a day . Weight of the evidence : there is hope in improved filters . <P> Men who smoke less than a pack a day run a markedly reduced risk of lung cancer ( compared with the much higher risk for those who smoke two packs or more ) . So , Dr. Ernest L. Wynder of Manhattan 's Sloan-Kettering Institute told the committee , a filter that stops 40% or more of tar from a regular cigarette made of good tobacco " will be a partial answer . " But during the five-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Testified Dr. Wynder : " Some companies have taken advantage of the public 's desire for filtered cigarettes and its equal wish for good tobacco flavor by marketing increasingly ineffective filters . " <P> Added- " Easy Draw . " Wynder 's and other laboratory studies have shown that most filter-tip brands are as bad as . in many cases actually worse than , old-fashioned untipped cigarettes of regular length , because 1 ) the filters catch only a minimum of tar . and 2 ) to get the flavor through the filter , the manufacturers have taken to using stronger tobacco , which produces more tar . <P> As Congressmen examined researchers on both sides of the smoking-and-lung-cancer controversy , they won from Scientist Clarence Cook Little of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee the surprising admission that he knew nothing about filters one way or the other . He had . he confessed , never received any reports on filters from the industry which pays his salary , had never been shown filter experiments on trips to cigarette factories . <P> With a nationwide ad blast in the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved the filter in its Kent cigarettes to give " significantly less tars and nicotine . . . plus easy draw . " Though Lorillard did not mention the word " health " in its ads. or Dr. Wynder 's specifications , it appeared to meet those specifications . A Kent regular , it claimed , passes 17 milligrams of tar and 1.36 milligrams of nicotine through its filter ; the king size passes 21 milligrams of tar . 1.7 milligrams of nicotine ( an independent laboratory got slightly higher readings for the tar . lower for nicotine ) . This put Kent regulars 36% to 44% lower in tar yield than unfiltered regulars , and Kent kings 14% to 40% lower than competing filter kings . <P> Wanted : Rules . Dr. Wynder pointed out , however , that a 40% filter would be effective only " provided that the smoker does not decide to smoke twice as many cigarettes , and provided , too , that the tobacco selection , cut or packing , is not altered to yield increasingly more tar ... Regulations must be passed that establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given filter , and require the manufacturer to state the effectiveness of the filter . " <P>
