In Newport , Ky. ( pop . 31,044 ) , just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati , gambling houses and brothels have often caused trouble , so newsmen are ever on the alert for stories there . One night last summer , the Louisville Courier-Journal got a solid telephone tip about Newport , and sent Photographer George Bailey hustling to the scene . The tip : Glenn Schmidt 's Playtorium , a plush **32;9554;TOOLONG club , was about to be raided . The leader of the raid was Newport 's Detective Jack Thiem , who had hired 16 private detectives in Louisville , 106 miles from Newport , to help him . <P> When Photographer Bailey arrived on the scene , he got more than he expected . Inside the Playtorium the raiding party not only found such gambling equipment as crap tables and bingo games ; they also encountered Newport 's Police Chief George Gugel , and three detectives who had just dropped in " for a soft drink . " Photographer Bailey snapped pictures , including one of Chief Gugel with Playtorium Proprietor Schmidt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Arrest that man ! " shouted Chief Gugel , pointing at Photographer Bailey . " I 'm still boss in this town , and I 'll tell you when you can take my picture . " He seized Bailey 's camera , ruined his film , and had him carted off to jail . The Courier-Journal reported what had happened in Page One stories , and a grand jury indicted Police Chief Gugel for interfering with Photographer Bailey 's civil rights . Another grand jury indicted Gugel for " nonfeasance of duty , " i.e. , failing to suppress gambling and prostitution . The same jury also indicted Detective Thiem , the raider , on charges of breaking the law himself by having an interest in a brothel , and said he staged the raid on the Playtorium to retaliate for earlier raids on houses he was protecting . <P> In the uproar of indictments , charges and countercharges , Gugel temporarily withdrew from the force and Thiem was fired ( he is now a special deputy sheriff in Las Vegas , Nev . ) . Although Gugel got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nonfeasance charge , he still faced a federal indictment for his attack on Photographer Bailey . Last week in a U.S. District Court in Covington , Ky. , a federal jury found that Policeman Gugel had exceeded his powers , convicted him of violating Photographer Bailey 's civil rights and fined him $1,000 plus court costs . Said District judge MacSwinford : " Bailey was performing his duties and had a right to take pictures and the right to his liberty . He took the pictures in an orderly and peaceful way and was within his rights . "
