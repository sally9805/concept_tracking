A Story by Priscilla D. Willis Drawing by N. M. Bodecker A little wine of the country N OBODY urged me to buy him . The touts did n't mutter behind knuckly , red fingers that I 'd be making an awful mistake if I let him get away ; the auctioneer did n't extol the virtues of his breeding ; and the horsemen , those pantologists with the gin-clear eyes focused now upon the colt in the ring , did n't nod sagely , and tell me he looked as sound as a bell of brass to them . Nobody sold me the horse . I bought him . The auctioneer knocked him down to me before I had lowered my chin . The sales catalogue stated that he had started once that year , at two . The racing chart showed that he had finished twenty-third in a field of twenty-four . " I did n't think race tracks were wide enough to start twenty-four horses all at once , " Charles said . " Still , if the others were all as narrow as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the astonishment of the examining veterinarians , the colt , whose name was Wilson Pusey , recovered from the innumerable and unrelated ailments plaguing his wretched brown body . He even got over the cough which threatened to blow his head off the end of his long , ropy neck . At three he was n't exactly strapping , but he could stand up without staggering , and his hair coat commenced to show a faint polish . After a while he was galloped on the track in the mornings ; once he breezed six furlongs in I:21 . Watching him , his trainer shook his head . " Never saw a horse move like that one ; his legs all go in a different direction at the same time . It 's a wonder he do n't trip himself . " His second race was better than his first . He was sixth in a pack of seven , but still it was a better race . He started half a dozen times after that , and then his trainer said we ought to put him up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , " he said . He intimated he was running out of jockeys . The colt has a dead mouth . The boys ca n't rate him at all . They just have to sit there and let him run the way he wants to . They do n't like that ; it 's an uncomfortable feeling . " Back in his stall in the shed-row I had many visits with Wilson Pusey . I never tried to touch him , for the boy who ponied him told me , " Missus , if you go to patting that one , you 'll bring your arm back without a hand . " Soon I gave up inquiring about the boys missing from the stable gang . The answer was always the same : " George , ' e got ' is this morning . Knocked the feed tub right out of ' is ' and , ' e did , and sunk ' is bloody teeth clean up to the gooms in old George 's arm . " Or : " Sans , he liked to get hisself killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bof ' hind feet whilest he were amuckin ' out de stall . " The blacksmith had had it ; the dentist had had it ; and the vets on their routine check-ups peered briefly over the stall guard and said , " He looks fit enough : let 's see the next one . " And they moved on up the row . Even the dogs and the cats , the chickens and the goat that hung around the barn taking their ease in the stalls of the other horses circled way out from under the shed-row when they passed his . It seemed as if Wilson Pusey did n't want to be friends with anyone . I used to stand at his door and watch him for a long time . Mostly , he stood with his back to me , his head hung in a dark corner . Thinking , I guess . But sometimes he would turn around and pinning his ears back , rush at me , his lips rolled up above his small white teeth . Occasionally he 'd stand still and just stare back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face , the tense , pinched look as if something was hurting him . I thought about it for a long time . A D A Y came when I had a chance to accom- pany my husband to Louisville . I took it . I knew that Wilson Pusey 's sire and his dam lived nearby . Surely one or the other might be able to give me a clue to the colt 's behavior ! Business completed , Charles offered to drive me out to the country in spite of the fact that he had one of his sinus headaches coming on . He cursed himself for leaving his new pills at home ; they helped him a lot . We found the sire of the colt down on his knees in one corner of his paddock . He had thrust his head under the lowest board of the enclosure and was nibbling a fringe of green grass inaccessible to him except for his extraordinary posture . He was an agreeable horse and obviously smart . We patted him and fed him a package of square gumdrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his groom said , so we saved the black one till last . The mare lived on a twenty-five hundred acre farm so elaborately beautiful that it made us feel like whispering . We tiptoed across the macadam courtyard surrounded by a clipped yew hedge , to the vine-covered stable where twin white cupolas glistened like spun sugar ornaments at either end of the long , slate roof . Every knob , latch , and hinge sparkled like gold . " How do you suppose any animal raised on this place can he so god-awful ornery ? " Charles asked . The tack room to which we were directed was as imposing as a financier 's library . We sank into a soft leather sofa and waited to be presented . Finally a groom nodded to us . We stepped out upon a flagstone terrace where an old Negro , shank in hand , stood at the head of a large , deep-bellied brood mare . At once I noticed the same pained , tight look about her face that her son had . if she 'd been a woman she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were red-rimmed , and she fastened them threateningly upon us , at the same time swelling her fluted nostrils . The Negro tightened his hold on the shank , but the mare reared and commenced to box the air just above our heads . When the groom , dangling as he had oeen on the other end of the lead-shank , had regained his footing I asked him how her disposition was , sidestepping a sudden thrust from a hind leg . " Generally speaking , " I added , over the knot of terror in my throat . He shook his old , graying head slowly . " She 's kinda hateful , miss , " he replied softly . At this moment a gentleman stepped out of the tack room onto the terrace . He spoke cordially and explained that he was Rufus Tate , the owner of the farm . " I drove down front the house when I heard you were here , " he said pleasantly . He was a tall , heavy-shouldered man dressed in vintage tweeds plastered with leather patches . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear , tanned skin , was like old mahogany whose fine scratches lie deep beneath the surface polish . His smile was wide and friendly . " My wife , " Charles told him , " owns a son of your mare , here ; a colt named Wilson Pusey . " " Is that so ? " Mr. Tate responded politely , but I saw him flinch just a trifle . " I 've often wondered what happened to that one . " His tone of voice suggested that he had made his first and only comment on the subject , and that any further discussion would be distasteful to him . " Come on up to the house , " he invited , taking me by the arm , " and have a drink before you go . Some people have just dropped in . " The narrow road , bordered by trees on both sides , meandered upwards for perhaps a mile through gently rising fields of grass divided by old stone fences into a checkerboard of pastures where cattle and horses were grazing . It ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking the valley . We walked up the low , wide-Hung steps and crossed the white-columned veranda . Inside , Mr. Tate took us through a superbly proportioned drawing-room and led us into a library where pictures of many horses hung . A few people were gathered around the fire ; they all seemed to be talking at once . Introductions performed , Mr. Tate handed each of us a silver cup . " A little wine of the country ? " He raised his eyebrows amiably . The whisky went down like maple syrup . I sipped mine pleasurably , somewhat surprised that Charles emptied his almost immediately . Alcohol , he has said many times , only inflames his sinuses . I sat down beside a diminutive lady who wore her many years as carelessly as the toque , fashioned of velvet pansies , upon her marcelled waves of coral-colored hair . She was perched as a pipit might have perched , on the edge of a soft cushion . Her name was Mrs. Buffington . " You horse people ? " she asked brightly , including Charles with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pansies . " Well , not really , " I replied . " One swallow does n't make a spring , you know , but as a matter of fact ? .. ' ' " I 've had dozens of them ! " she interrupted before I could explain about Wilson Pusey . " Got cats now . More fun . Horses always have some-thing the matter with them . Never can run when you want them to . " She pointed a small , straight finger at a chubby-cheeked , balding man in a double-breasted checked suit standing by the fire extending his cup for another drink . " That , " she announced , " is Mr. Sydney GassoonSmith , one of the best authorities on cats in the world . I brought him over from England to give me his opinion of my Abyssinians . Much cheaper than taking a hundred and seventy-eight cats abroad . Less trouble , too . They are very susceptible to colds . " I nodded sympathetically , and emptied my cup . N E X T to Mr. Sydney Gassoon  --  Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy gentleman from Canada whose large mustache was the color of wild strawberries , was speaking with great animation to a dismal-looking fellow who was trying terribly hard to buy a Bimelech filly he had seen on a nearby horse farm . Every little while he would go to the phone and oiler the owner a few more thousand dollars , and he could be heard whining in the mouthpiece , " But why wo n't you sell her ? " And when he returned he looked more dismal than ever . " All my people are Canadians , " the man with the mustache was saying briskly . " We 've lived there forever , you might say . My grandmother was a Guelph . " " Really ? " the Bimelech man said absently . " 1 thought they were extinct . " Charles was fingering the coin silver cups Mrs. Tate was showing him , explaining how she had found each one . His face was rather flushed . " By Gad , that 's good whisky ! " exclaimed the Canadian , striding over to the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you get it ? " Rufus Tate told him that each year he took a few of his own barrels to a friend in a small distillery and had them . worked over . " Just for our own use , and for our friends , " he said . " Ittests around a hundred and seventeen proof . Of course , " he added looking dubiously at his guests , " you do n't stay with it all evening . " " None of that fire-water for me ! " Mrs. Buffington called over from the sofa where we were sitting . " At least not when I 'm driving . Last time I left here I sheared off my bumper and a front fender before I got to the main road . Rufus , you must do away with that grove of what-youmacallunts at the third turn near the bottom of the hill . They 're an unpleasant challenge . " Mr. Tate laughed . " For you , Lavinia , I may do just that , but I 'm pretty fond of those trees . Great-granddaddy planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the mantel where the likeness of a benign old man hung between an engraving of Flora Temple , the trotting mare , and a primitive painting . of Bulk Rock , the first thoroughbred imported to this country from England . It was obvious that Mr. Tate loved the three equally . Mr. Gassoon-Smith was holding forth on a breed of cat unfamiliar to me . The name , as he said it , sounded like " Bwemerishes . " " A peculiar thing happened in this breed , " he said , swaying uncertainly back and forth like a cattail on a broken stalk . " They turned white , absolutely white . Albinism crept in , nobody knows why . Very baffling to the geneticists . But the whole goddam breed turned white . " He was very impressed . " However , " he continued , " they can still be found in certain parts of Asia , the mountain regions , I believe . " I looked across the room at Charles . He was seated now in a wing chair by the fire . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were closed . I could see the torment in his face , the tense , pinched look he got when his headaches were upon him . All at once his face commenced to blur ; his features seemed to be disappearing entirely , and his head moved slowly from one shoulder to the other like a pendulum , one , two , one , two . Putting my drink down on the table I sat up straight and opened my eyes wide . Charles was gradually taking shape again , but when his head stopped moving it did n't in the least resemble his own . The chin was elongated far below his collar and the knot of his tie ; brown ears stood up on either side of his poll ; his nostrils quivered in agony . Bare teeth gleamed savagely in his opened mouth . " Wilson ! " I exclaimed , jumping up , " Wilson Pusey ! " I got Charles to his feet with some difficulty . We disengaged ourselves from Mr. GassoonSmith who was speaking now on the coat of Abyssinian cats , holding an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair shaft , " he was saying , " has three distinct colors , running ' orizontally . " He clicked his nails . " Like a pousse-caf ? , rather . . .. " Before taking our leave of the Tates we promised to arrange better quarters for Mrs. Buflington 's cats the next time a cat show was held in our city . " The last time , " she said , " it was so cold and draughty they started coughing the night before they were to be judged . " " We 'll put you all up at The Racquet Club , " Charles said thickly , holding onto his throbbing head . A F E W weeks later I was at the racetrack again where the colt was training . I visited him three times a day , taking the lumps of sugar I had filled with my husband 's sinus pills . The first time I stood at his stall with the proffered sugar cube my hand shook so hadly I dropped it . The colt was interested . He watched me bend down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , palm up . He raised and lowered his head with every move I made . When at last he took the lump he dropped it from his mouth and 1 had to pick it up again , but soon we both caught on . It was not long before he tuckered when he saw me coming down the shed-row . His trainer said one morning , " That colt 's finally beginning to come to himself . Guess it 's a good thing we put him up last season . He worked six in one sixteen and no change this morning , and he 's beginning to run like a racehorse . Not such a roughneck as he used to be , either . " I smiled and doubled the dose . Then came the afternoon when half a dozen cubes fell out of my purse and the pills , rolling out of the small holes I 'd wedged them in , scattered on the ground . The trainer rushed at me . For a few seconds he stood sputtering , growing very red in the face . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell I thought I was doing . " Giving him his medicine , " I answered . " He has sinus headaches . " " Sinus trouble ! A horse ? " he bellowed. never heard of a horse with ' a headache ! " " That does n't mean they ca n't have them . " " But I do n't think horses June sinuses . " His anger turned to uneasiness because he had been training for thirty years and did n't know whether horses had sinuses or not . " Of course , " he admitted , " if it was possible , it might be the reason he quits so bad . Ca n't get enough oxygen to his lungs . But that 's ridiculous . The whole thing 's ridiculous ! " Then he turned on me likea feint , " You had no business doing this . It is n't regular at all . I could get into a lot of trouble ! " He turned still redder . " How do you know what 's in that medicine ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband when he has headaches and when he has them he looks exactly like Wilson Pusey . " The trainer walked a few feet away . He stood there thinking . I picked up the pills and put them back in the sugar . " Wait ! " He lunged at me and grabbed both my wrists . " Do n't give him any today ! I 'm going to run him Thursday and a horse can have no medication of any kind for forty-eight hours before he races . It 's a rule at every racetrack . " " All right , " I agreed . " But we 'll steam his head out the morning of the race . That helps sometimes , too . There 's no rule against that , is there ? " He did n't answer . Instead , he dropped into his canvas chair under the shed-row and did n't say another word to anybody the rest of the day . Just sat there brooding and staring into space . The day of the race Wilson Pusey threw his jockey before he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever . " Anything that happens today is your fault , not mine , " the trainer hissed at me panting from the exertion of tightening the girths . The odds board showed the colt at eighty to one . " Last time , " Charles said , stepping up to the corner of the grandstand porch from where the trainer and I were going to watch the race , " he was ninety to one . This is a good sign . " He did not call my attention to the handicapper 's comment after his name in the newspaper , which read , " Miserable sort . " The colt broke on top . He opened up a lead of about five lengths . I dug my elbow in the trainer 's ribs . " Do n't mean a thing , " he said , out of the side of his mouth . " He 'll he all through at the half , just like always . " But Wilson Pusey was n't through at the half . He was n't through until he coasted under the wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said that colt had come to himself , did n't I ? " the trainer cried , stumbling down the stairs in his hurry to get to the winner 's circle . My sides ached from my husband 's embrace . " How much did you have on him ? " He shouted like a small boy on Christmas morning . I shook my head . " Not a thing . " But Charles did n't hear me . Holding firmly to his mutual ticket , he was pushing his way through the crowd toward the cashier 's window .
