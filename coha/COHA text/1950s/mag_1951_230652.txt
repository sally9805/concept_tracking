When U.S. Dancer Ruth Page tried her lusty ballet Frankie and Johnny on the French last year , they gave her a bad time of it ( TIME , May 22 , 1950 ) . The audience whistled in derision . Paris critics , unfamiliar with the story of Frankie and Johnny and completely out of step with Page 's kidding treatment of it , scourged the ballet with such epithets as " catastrophe . ' ' " monstrous " and " unconsciously obscene . " Last week Ruth Page was back with a new ballet . It was called Revanche ( Revenge ) , and it was the hit of Paris . <P> Ruth Page got the idea for it five years ago . It was to be a spoofing treatment of Verdi 's // Trovatore ( Verdi 's subtitle : " The Gypsy 's Revenge " ) . But two years ago , she heard a rousing performance of Trovatore by the Metropolitan Opera , and " the first thing I knew , I was crying . " She tore up her burlesque and designed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity . In reducing Verdi 's tortuously complicated , four-act opera to 52 minutes of dance , she " left out enough good music and plot to make three more ballets , " but made the story of a gypsy out to avenge the burning of her mother compellingly clearer . <P> The first-night audience was on Page 's side almost as soon as the curtain went up . She had engaged top Spanish Designer Antoni Clave to do the sets , and he had turned out some breathtaking ones in melodramatic black , blue and crimson . Then the Gypsy Azucena ( Sonia Arova ) lashed into a dance to Verdi 's crackling Stride lavampa music , and Page and the dancers were in full command . In the Anvil Chorus , the dancers whirled with so much gusto that the crowd could hardly keep from stomping out the rhythm with them . Standout scene : Azucena 's duet with Manrico , her foster-son and the instrument of her revenge against the aristocratic Di Luna family . The ballet , like the opera , ended in a flood of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wicked Count di Luna going mad . The curtain came down with Azucena triumphant in her revenge-and , by proxy , Ruth Page triumphant in hers . The work got twelve curtain calls . <P> The critics rose handsomely to the occasion . Said L'Aurore : " The Revanche of Ruth Page is one of extravagance based on good taste . " Le Figaro : " A beautiful spectacle . " Franc-Tireur : " The choreography is so ingenious and so expressive that none of the sharp turnings of fortune in the drama escape us . " <P> Said glowing Ruth Page : " I wrote the part of Azucena for myself . Now I 'm dying to dance it . "
