The bad weather that dogged him virtually ever since he left home was there with a vengeance as Dick Nixon climbed into a car in Vienna bound for the refugee camps near the Hungarian border . A thick mist scummed the windshields as the 39-car motorcade rolled eastward under the grey sky toward Andau , a scant kilometer from the border . The mud was ankle-deep along the roadside , and the heavy mist was raw and penetrating . The weather failed to daunt the 300-odd refugees gathered at the camp , and it equally failed to daunt the Vice President of the U.S. who stepped from the car , trim and neat in black shoes , black suit and black Homburg . <P> Good Fellowship . A Red Cross lunch of soup , bread , cheese and sliced sausage was about to be served when the visitor entered the camp dining hall . It was promptly forgotten as photographers and newsmen milled among the refugees who were swarming to greet the caller . Holding his own bravely in the melee , Nixon had a word or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wish we had time to greet you all personally , " he said . The refugees responded with a rousing , " Long live Hungarian-American friendship . " <P> From Andau , the motorcade moved on to the bigger camp at Eisenstadt , through which about 60,000 refugees have passed en route to other lands . Ten thousand of them were at the camp when he arrived . Once again , there was the press of newsmen and refugees , the snatches of conversation , the handshakes and the good wishes , and once again on Nixon 's part a winning display of cordial good fellowship . After that came Traiskirchen , another camp , another crowd . The visitor 's one quiet moment came as he attended a Christmas party and play for the refugee children in the camp auditorium . When the play was done , the Virgin , a plump eight-year-old , and one of her angels sat happily on the Vice President 's lap as all of them sang Silent Night . <P> Sneak to the Border . Next day Dick Nixon returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspect the quarters where refugees seeking entry to the U.S. are processed . On leaving the headquarters , he insisted on abandoning his car to stroll along the crowded Vienna street and chat with passersby . The Viennese , like the Hungarians in the refugee camps , were astonished : the handshaking stroll , a fixture of the U.S. political scene , was a novelty to Europeans , but they appeared delighted . <P> In the middle of the night , telling newspapermen nothing about it , Nixon headed for the Hungarian border in a limousine , transferring to a tractor for the last muddy stretch . He arrived just as two Hungarian girls were sneaking across the border in the predawn light . He asked them , as he had asked many of the refugees , what made them want to escape . " A search for safety , " was the reply through an interpreter . The girls were astonished to learn his identity . Said Nixon later : " It was n't me , of course , but my office that impressed and surprised them-the fact that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet them . " <P> Himself much impressed by all that he had seen , Nixon summed up his trip : " It is obvious that Austria , the U.S. and other free nations have done a great deal . . . However , I am convinced that the U.S. must do more than it already has done . "
