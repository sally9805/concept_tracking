One of the most terrifying achievements of the Nazi regime was its relentless capture and corruption of German youth . In Eastern Germany , the Communists have proved themselves as good as the Nazis at that deadly game . Their Freie Deutsche Jugend ( Free German Youth ) seems like a near-perfect reincarnation of the Hitler Youth . The world might get a good look at the young Communists when they stage their long-heralded " march on Berlin " on Whitsunday ( see above ) . Last week , TIME Correspondent Enno Hobbing cabled this preview of the FDJ : <P> <P> " Be Prepared . " The process of corruption begins early . Nine hundred thousand children between the ages of six and 14 are enrolled in the Junge Pioniere ( Young Pioneers ) , the FDJ " cubs . " Most of them are drawn in by subtle threats that they will not be promoted in school , by pressure on parents , and by channeling the natural idealism of the young to party purposes . <P> The kids are attracted by scoutlike slogans : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects the people , a Young Pioneer fights for his homeland . " Overall motto of the moppets is " Seid Bereit ! Be Prepared . " Their greeting consists of holding the hand ( its five fingers represent the five continents ) over the head , to indicate that the Junge Pionier puts the welfare of the world over his own. * <P> For special attainments , e.g. , compositions on Red heroes , the pioneer gets a Bewhrungstuch ( merit scarf ) ; after that , he is eligible for the red scarf and white blouse that signify full-fledged membership . All of the pioneers get chances to march with banners and standards in Red mass rallies . After such parades , they can be heard telling each other " Das war Spass , nicht ? That was fun , was n't it ? . " <P> " Knock Them Down . " For youngsters between 14 and 24 , the fun gets more intense . A million of them belong to the FDJ proper . High-school students who want to graduate or attend universities have little chance if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must go to work early , find it hard to get jobs without the FDJ membership card . The FDJ is in charge of all sports in the Soviet zone ; grey heads have to ask FDJ adolescents for fishing and hunting licenses . <P> The FDJ makes an especially heavy impact on the more impressionable youngsters . One young man , formerly a devoted Hitlerite , saw his dreams crash down in 1945 . First he contemplated suicide , then he withdrew into complete apathy . By way of a soccer club , he got into the FDJ . Says he now : " Sometimes I 'm terribly afraid I might be wrong again . I could n't stand a second mental bankruptcy . No ! The Communists must be right . Look at their successes-look at China ! " <P> Many of FDJ members are rowdy , opportunist youths , like Hans Gossen , FDJ leader in Saxony . As a Hitler Youth Bannfhrer , he had tasted power young . As a P.W . of the Russians , he did a quick about-face . In his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into Naziism , but that in Russia his eyes had been opened . Said he : " I want to devote myself to progress . Despite my belated awakening , I beg that I may be accepted . " His wish was fulfilled .
