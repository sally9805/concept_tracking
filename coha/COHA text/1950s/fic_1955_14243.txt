The gleaming deluge of the setting sun dies from the top of Indian Fort Mountain , and the dead embers of the big hill across the creek fade to the color of gray ashes . Among the leafy oak forest of the flat lowlands below the murk of evening thickens and deepens . The lights have come on in the amphitheatre , and the audience has assembled for the play . The lights go down and out , there is an instant of pause , and then breaking across the darkness comes the roll of military drums . The roll is repeated . Following that , a spirited military march begins in the organ and sound track  --  gay , triumphant , brazen even , with its bugle calls and fanfare . It grows louder and louder , stitched through with the rhythmic beat of marching feet and now and then the sound of whistles blowing . Gradually it begins to die , fades and continues to fade till the final tiny drumtap is heard no more . Again there is an instant of pause . The ORGANIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation , " and plays it through once , contrasting its solemn style with the march . He softens it down to an accompaniment as the amplified voice of the PREACHER comes in above it from the darkness of the center stage . THE PREACHER Half-reciting , half-intoning. p. 3 In the beginning was the word , And the word was with God , And the word was God , The same was in the beginning with God . The light comes up at the right rear of the center stage disclosing a glimpse of a little mountain church , set ' among the hills with trees around it . The small white steeple and part of the roof show above , the rest being shadowed off into darkness . The congregation is heard singing inside the church . The voice of the PREACHER comes in again . THE PREACHER All things were made by him , And without him was not anything made that was made.He giveth life to all and breath to all . EarnestlyHe hath made of one blood all nations of menFor to dwell on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have our being . CONGREGATION Fear not , I am with thee , O be not dismayed , &nbsp; &nbsp; I , I am thy God and will still give thee aid.I 'll strengthen thee , help thee , and cause thee to stand &nbsp; Upheld by my righteous , omnipotent hand . THE PREACHER In him was lifeAnd the light was the light of menAnd the light shineth in darknessAnd the darkness comprehendeth it not . CONGREGATION AND PREACHER Recitingly and together. p. 4 And the darkness comprehendeth it not . The organ continues to play and we see the congregation of mountain people now coming out of the little building and from around the side of it and returning home across the center stage . A few of them carry lanterns . CONGREGATION Singing as they go . The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not , I will not desert to his foes.That soul though all hell should endeavor to shake &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll never , no never , no never forsake . The people disappear into the darkness at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the group and comes on out to the front toward the audience . As he steps into the waiting spotlight he becomes the Narrator . The singing fades in the distance , The last lantern wink is seen , and the organ dies . The spot brightens on the NARRATOR who is looking in the direction of the departing congregation . He is a genial , kindly man , somewhat like a country parson , and is dressed in the style of the 1850 's . He is of medium height , rather square built , with a large head and deep-set eyes and kindly yet forceful face . His manner is calm and earnest , and he gives the impression of believing every word he says and feeling it important . THE NARRATOR That blessed old song  --  with its promise and assurance of a firm foundation ! Our forefathers sang it in that little church . We sing it . And may our children continue to sing it and believe in it . Turning toward the audience. p. 5 We are met tonight in honor those men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching their religious and democratic faith among the people . And as the early pioneers who had preceded them nearly another hundred years before had had to travel a long hard Wilderness Road to reach this land of their desiring and our heritage  --  so did these pioneers of the spirit , these teachers , have to travel their Wilderness Road in the service of their ideal . Not through jungles and woods and craggy mountains of earth did they travel  --  but through misunderstandings , passions and persecutions of misguided men , their neighbors even . More briskly and matter-of-factly . Our play begins back in a valley some miles to the east of here , and the time is the year 1858 . Young John Freeman has just returned home to his beloved hills . And at this hour his heart is resolute , his faith and courage strong for the work he plans ahead . And well they are so-for the threat of a vast and tragic civil war is already darkening over the land , and the anguished question , of slavery is pushing itself forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , bows and retires as the light fades . The organ reprises the last few bars of " How Firm a Foundation " for transition music . Then the light comes up on the right side stage. @x High in the hills , a late afternoon in spring . In the background is an out-jutting ledge of rocky headland . JOHN FREEMAN and ELSIE SIMS are just arriving there after a steep climb up the mountain . They come farther out on the ledge and stand side by side gazing at the view , their figures bathed in the golden glow of the slanting sunlight . FREEMAN is a well set up young man of twenty-four or five , plainly but neatly dressed in the style of the 1850 's . He is bare-headed , his hat in his hand , his shirt collar undone and his sleeves rolled up . His coat hangs loosely across his arm . His eyes are dark , his face lean and somewhat darkly pale , and his hair thick and unruly . ELSIE is an attractive mountain girl of nineteen or twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calico dress and with a blue scarf about her neck . She wears stout little everyday shoes . Her cheeks are pink , her lips full , her eyes large and gray , and her hair , which she has pushed back from her forehead , is heavy and honey-colored . She is panting a bit from the climb . JOHN FREEMAN Gesturing . Well , Elsie , here it is  --  our lookout over half of Kentucky  --  miles and miles . ELSIE SIMS With a touch of spirit . And you climbed so fast , John , I 'm all out of breath . She dabs the dew of sweat from her face with the end of her scarf. p. 7 JOHN FREEMAN I was in a hurry to get up here and have a look . ELSIE SIMS Used to I could race you slam to the top , remember . But I 'm out of practice now . Glancing at the side of his face . After you went off to Ohio to school I did n't come up here any more . JOHN FREEMAN Pointing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lexington , I bet  --  way , way yonder . Golly , I 've missed these hills . He sweeps his arms about the scene . This is home . Out there in Ohio it never really felt like home  --  the land is so flat . ELSIE SIMS With a bit of teasingness in her voice . Seemed like it did  --  you were gone a long time . JOHN FREEMAN I could n't come back often , could I ? I was too poor , too busy studying : Study , study  --  work , work every spare hour to pay my way . ELSIE SIMS Course you had to get your education  --  yes  --  JOHN FREEMAN Reaching his arms happily above his head and letting them fall . But now I 'm here . On the way I kept thinking of this place  --  our hilltop . He turns and looks into her face , smiling . I knew what I 'd do  --  I 'd come right up here and see it . Hardly took time to put my valise down and tell Ma and brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIMS I 'm glad you come by for me . JOHN FREEMAN Course I would . They move over to another part of the rock and gaze off . JOHN FREEMAN This must be something like what old Dan'l Boone saw when he first come into Kentucky eighty years ago . No wonder he could n't ever get it out of his mind and had to go back and bring other folks in here . From the brush at the back a bird is heard giving its call . Listen there at that bird . ELSIE SIMS It 's a raincrow  --  sounds lonesome ! Ma says they bring bad luck . JOHN FREEMAN A yellow-billed cuckoo , that 's the real name . And it do n't bring bad luck . Moving over to another place and staring up the valley . What 's happened ? I ca n't see your house up there with the chimneys . He puts his hat on . ELSIE SIMS Trees can grow a lot in three years , John . JOHN FREEMAN That 's right . He peers over the edge and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cabin down there , the smoke coming up . Ma 's about to start supper . Think of it , she 's been cooking in that fireplace for thirty years  --  not even a stove . Poverty , Elsie , poverty ! p. 9 ELSIE SIMS She 's got a stove now . Your brother Davie worked out the money and bought her one . JOHN FREEMAN Heartily . Good for Davie . Far in the distance below , the sound of a boy 's high voice is heard singing . JOHN stares off and down . That 's Otho Turner  --  just like always bringing the cow home in the evening and singing his ballad song  --  Half-singing . JOHN looks at her and Joins in the next stanza . JOHN AND ELSIE Singing . Oh , you remember on yon green mountain &nbsp; Where you and I first told our love , The little birds were sweetly singing &nbsp; And sweetly sang the turtle dove . They laugh and look at each other . JOHN reaches out toward her and then drops his hand suddenly . She turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then up to another and higher outlook at the left . ELSIE goes down after him and joins him on the crag . JOHN picks up a stone and sends it sailing across the void in a whipping pantomime of arm movement . JOHN FREEMAN Right into the river ! Davie and me used to come up here and throw rocks . It always made him mad for me to outthrow him . p. 10 ELSIE SIMS You were always stronger than Davie , smarter . Hurriedly . I mean in books . JOHN laughs and moves over to another part of the rock and gazes off . The sunset comes on more brightly , illuminating the background of treetops and shrubbery in a splurge of color . In the distance we see the timber and trestle work of a high bridge over the unseen river below . ELSIE comes and stands by him . JOHN FREEMAN This is the purtiest country in all the world , Elsie  --  with the trees and the hills about and the river down there  --  the valley stretching away yonder , and the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELSIE SIMS It is , John . JOHN FREEMAN And that railroad bridge there against the sunset  --  strong and solid . It 's built where the old Wilderness Road crossed the river long ago . I 've thought about that bridge a lot . Like a sort of symbol it is  --  a bridge through the wilderness helping to bind this mighty country together . He stares off in silence . ELSIE SIMS They say many a slave died in the building of it . JOHN FREEMAN Out of their muscle-power and sweat  --  their tribulation it was built . Turning back to her . My father used to take me and Davie over there when he 'd go to preach to the slaves . He grieved over them a lot . Soberly . He was a good man , Pa was . His heart was right . He had love in it . And that 's what people need , Elsie , love in their hearts . ELSIE looks up at him . And he was a strong man , yeh , like these hills  --  strong . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have gone a long ways if he 'd had a little education . But he did n't . He could hardly read his Bible . Like the rest of the folks here , he was shut up in these hills  --  he did n't know what was out there . He had no chance . Turning and looking at her . The finest folks in the world are here , Elsie  --  a proud and great people  --  brave-hearted , with willing hands . And the women  --  my mother and others like her . Think of their patience , their endurance , . their devotion  --  and what they go through with  --  the hardship . Poverty , I said . Smiling at her . You see I had to come back to live with my own folks . p. 11 ELSIE SIMS You mean you 've come back to stay ? JOHN FREEMAN That 's what I intend . ELSIE SIMS A little puzzled and somewhat disappointed . We always thought  --  I thought after you got your education you 'd be going off to Cincinnati or Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought over it , prayed over it . Firmly . No , whatever God has called me to do I believe I can do it better here . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS and CHRIS SLOCUMB come along the mountainside at the left , both a bit merry from drink . UNCLE EPH is a spry , gnarled , weather-beaten little man of sixty-five or more , with a scraggly beard , and dressed in rough mountain clothes , with a shapeless hat and well-worn shoes . A jug of liquor , tied with a frayed piece of rope and hooked over his bony shoulder , hangs by his side . He grasps a tall ash sapling for a walking-stick as he comes . SLOCUMB is a gluttonous , somewhat pot-bellied young man of thirty or thirty-five , dressed in faded overalls and shirt , and wearing a wrinkled-brim cap and flat-spreading shoes , through which some of his naked toes have squashed . They both are carrying on " The Turtle Dove Song " in bibulous jollity from its sounding in the hills. p. 12 UNCLE EPH AND SLOCUMB Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will glove her white lily handAnd who will kiss her red ruby lips &nbsp; &nbsp; When I am on some furrin strand ? UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Well , bless my soul and wonder-working God ! Look a-there . CHRIS SLOCUMB Gazing blearily up and off . Elsie Sims  --  and if it ai n't John Freeman ! UNCLE EPH turns and starts waveringly up the incline . JOHN comes down to meet him . They embrace joyously . JOHN FREEMAN Uncle Eph , how are you ? UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Mean as ever . Golly , it pleasures me to look at you , boy . How you been ? JOHN FREEMAN Good . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS And you , Elsie darling child , light of the mountain sky  --  how you ? ELSIE SIMS Calling down . Fine . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Digging JOHN in the side . Ai n't she the purtiest thing in all Kaintucky land ! Better watch out or Davie 'll git jealous . Babbling on . Heh , heh , ' scuse me , John . I 'm feeling my liquor a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I went over to git me a supply  --  me and Chris . This here jug was dry as a doodle 's hole under the wagon shelter . Plaintively . And you know when my jug is dry how my confidence oozes all away  --  like my best friend had died . Then the wild hollers come lonesome round my door trying to git at me . He shudders. p. 13 JOHN FREEMAN Yes , I know . Nodding a greeting to SLOCUMB . How 're you , Chris ? CHRIS SLOCUMB You , John . To UNCLE EPH . We orter have another drink to celebrate . He reaches for the jug , but UNCLE EPH swings it out of his way . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS True , ' t is a sort of special occasion , John 's coming home . Lifting the jug toward JOHN . Jine us . JOHN shakes his head . Do you good-fill you with that brotherly love you talk about  --  and lift the weight of the world off'n your shoulders too . Right now I 'm full of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ELSIE shakes her head . Heh  --  then I 'll have to make up for both of you . He lifts the jug and drinks deeply . CHRIS SLOCUMB Perishing . Uncle Eph  --  gim me  --  gim me  --  UNCLE EPH lowers the jug with appreciative smackings of his lips , then holds it to SLOCUMB 'S thirsty mouth . He waits a moment and jerks it away with a suction pop . SLOCUMB squeals like a baby robbed of its ninny . CHRIS SLOCUMB Pantingly . Anh  --  anh  --  p. 14 UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS I aim to git you home sober to Mary and your six younguns . CHRIS SLOCUMB Wiping his mouth with his sleeve . Seven  --  we got a new one . He grins at JOHN . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Well , if you was as smart in the daytime as you are at night  --  Come on . He lets out his splattering laugh and he and SLOCUMB start on . UNCLE EPH calls back . See you at supper , John . He raises his song again , SLOCUMB joining in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purty little foot &nbsp; &nbsp; And Ma will glove my white lily hand , And none will kiss my red ruby lips &nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst you are on that furrin strand . They go away into the shadow . JOHN stares after them . JOHN FREEMAN Mary Slocumb  --  seven children and hardly thirty years old yet  --  and Chris Slocumb , her husband there not worth a picayune . What chance would those children have ? None . They 'd grow up in ignorance like their parents  --  never see a book  --  keen , eager , quick to learn , waiting , waiting for a chance  --  never know what a book was . Turning sharply back . Yesterday , Elsie , on my way home , I come by Berea and saw Mr. Gregg Fee . He said he 'd get some books for me , he 'd help me . Gazing at her . I want to start a school here , Elsie . Yeh , like the one Mr. Fee and Mr. Rogers have started  --  hope to make it like that in time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little I do know . But such as it is I want to share it  --  with my people . I want to teach these mountain boys and girls . p. 15 ELSIE SIMS Thoughtfully . I 'm glad . You 'd make a good teacher . You know you always got me to read everything you could lay your hands on . JOHN FREEMAN Brightly . And you were quick to learn too . ELSIE SIMS Staring off . But the school  --  you would n't want it to be like Berea . Reckon you 've heard of the Abolition trouble they 've been having up there off and on . There 's been a lot of talk about their ideas . JOHN FREEMAN I happen to believe their ideas are right . I want you to help me , Elsie . ELSIE SIMS I 'll help you what I can then . I 'll enroll as your first student right now . Putting her hand on JOHN 'S arm . But , John , I know you can be stubborn when you think a thing is right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? JOHN FREEMAN Going on . You can talk it up among the young folks . ELSIE SIMS All right . And I 'll get Pa behind it . Whatever he says in this neighborhood people listen to  --  maybe except Mr. Isaac Miller and his crowd . Jubilantly . I know  --  we 'll have a welcome home for you  --  you can tell the folks about your plans then . We 'll have fun . She turns dancingly around in the scene , then stops . The valley 's all filling up with the dark . We better go . She turns back the way they came . JOHN gives another look off and hurries after her , then turns and takes off his hat. p. 16 JOHN FREEMAN Speaking suddenly and fervently across the void in front of him . Blessed of the Lord be his land  --  for the precious things of heaven , for the dew , and for the fruits brought forth by the sun , and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the incline . The organ comes in reprising " The Turtle Dove Song " as the light fades out . The music continues a moment , and then the light Comes up full on the center stage. p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE : Scene II The yard in front of the Sims home , early evening a few days later . The little porch of the house projects in at the left with gay blooming trumpet vines running up the posts . A crowd of mountain people are assembled here for a frolic . Among them are the hosts of the occasion , MARTIN SIMS and his wife JULIE MAE , also ISAAC MILLER and his wife LILY , HENRY SIMS and his wife ANNABELLE , GEORGE FARRIS and his wife ELLEN , KEITH TURNER and his wife ADA , ABNER DONOVAN and his wife JOSIE , and CHRIS SLOCUMB and his wife MARY , the latter with a baby in her arms . JED WILLIS , a local political leader is present too , and REVEREND ESAU MCKEE , a bearded , watchful patriarch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midwife , AUNT PATSY DONOVAN . JOHN FREEMAN is standing over at the right with AVIS MILLER and his mother ELIZABETH FREEMAN . DAVIE FREEMAN , JOHN 'S young brother , is making up to ELSIE in the center of the scene . GROVER MILLER and OTHO TURNER , two young mountain music makers and buddies , are at the right front . GROVER has his banjo and OTHO his fiddle . UNCLE EPH is moving in and out among the folks getting things organized for a square dance . A number of children and old folks are gathered about looking on . The people are dressed in every kind of outfit , ranging from work clothes to the bright calicoes of the young girls and to the few choking neck-pieces and vests of the young men . Now and then late arrivals enter , some of them with shotguns or muskets which they place against the side of the porch . They shake hands with JOHN and take their places in the scene . When the light comes up GROVER and OTHO are all set to begin pouring out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Come on , folkses , all of you  --  git ready to r'ally shake them feet . Some of the young men whistle their approval . ELIZABETH FREEMAN moves over to the porch . She is a neatly dressed middle-aged woman with a fine frank but toil-worn face. p. 18 GEORGE FARRIS A fat hearty fellow of thirty-five . Yea man , let 's see the Squire do his stuff . DAVIE FREEMAN Calling out gaily . Get out here , Miss Julie Mae . He is a high-spirited lithe young fellow of twenty-two or - three , with curly blond hair , white teeth and blue eyes . VOICES Dance , dance ! OTHER VOICES Music , music ! REVEREND ESAU MCKEE Calling out from the porch . Now we ai n't going to have none of this here weekedness . HENRY SIMS A middle-aged , jovial man of medium height  --  good naturedly . No we ai n't . Me and Julie Mae 'll see to that . Come on , woman . He leads his neat , light-footed wife out to the center . UNCLE EPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and quit a-jowering ! GROVER strums his banjo strings with eager fingers and OTHO bounces his bow over his fiddle strings in a few shrill notes . JED WILLIS , who has had his eye on ELSIE , moves toward her . JED WILLIS Sweeping off his broad hat in a low bow . My pleasure , Miss Elsie . He is about forty years old and is dressed much like a seedy Kentucky Colonel with his white collar , swollen tie and long square coat . JOHN turns to ELSIE and holds out his hand . DAVIE barges in at the same time. p. 19 DAVIE FREEMAN Come on , Elsie . ELSIE SIMS I promised John . DAVIE FREEMAN Instantly firing up . No you do n't . ELSIE SIMS Now , Davie  --  JOHN FREEMAN Go ahead and dance with him  --  I 'm not much good at it . He smiles at DAVIE . DAVIE FREEMAN Relenting . All right , but mine next time . He turns off and chooses AVIS MILLER . WILLIS looks about for a partner and takes plump little MINNIE ROSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPBELL 'S disappointment . JOHN FREEMAN To ELSIE . You 'll have to watch your feet . ELSIE smiles at him and puts her hand through his arm . GROVER and OTHO start their joyous flooding music of " Turkey in the Straw , " and the colorful dance gets under way . UNCLE EPH is soon in a lather of delight , giving his calls and making his flaunting turns with LILY MILLER , his partner . The scene develops into one of innocent abandonment , joy and beauty . SQUIRE SIMS and JULIE MAE set the pace . The dance goes on , and JOHN himself is caught in the fun . Some of the older people begin jigging about as the rhythm gets into their blood . Even BROTHER ESAU rises out of his chair and moves about the porch . AUNT PATSY DONOVAN , the old midwife who sits in a chair nearby hid under her bonnet and with a snuff brush sticking out of her mouth , lets forth a derisive cackle at him . ELIZABETH laughs . She is enjoying herself . ESAU snorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grub hands fiercely across his stomach and rocking violently yet rhythmically away . EXOM , an old Negro slave , comes in at the left , carrying a dinner bell in his hand . He stands looking happily on . His wrinkled wife DEBBIE joins him . SQUIRE SIMS lets out a whoop and begins cutting some fancy steps with his wife , as the music changes to " Old Dan Tucker . " p. 20 UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Gleefully . Something on a stick . Show ' em , Squire , show ' em ! GEORGE FARRIS Who is not dancing . You 'd never think he 's rich and owned slaves . ISAAC MILLER Also not dancing  --  a heavy , solemn man about the same age as SIMS . Him and Miss Julie won a prize at the courthouse once . HENRY SIMS Yelling . Come on , Grover Miller !  --  You , Otho Turner , are your fingers paralyzed ! He whirls JULIE MAE hoppingly about . JULIE MAE SIMS You 're squeezing me to death , Martin Sims . The people begin singing and clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , &nbsp; &nbsp; Swinging the ladies all around  --  UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Swing your partners ! The men swing their partners . PEOPLE First to the right and then to the left &nbsp; &nbsp; And then to the one that you love best . The men go back to their partners and swing . The song goes on . Old Dan Tucker  --  fine old man , &nbsp; &nbsp; Washed his face in the frying pan , Combed his head with the wagon wheel &nbsp; &nbsp; And died with the toothache in his heel.Get out of the way , Old Dan Tucker , &nbsp; &nbsp; Get out of the way , Old Dan Tucker , ' Get out of the way , Old Dan Tucker , &nbsp; &nbsp; You 're too late to get your supper . The dance finally finishes , and the dancers stand catching their breath , some of them flopping about on waiting benches and chairs and fanning themselves with their hands and handkerchiefs . DAVIE , still in the fervor of the dance , comes over and carries ELSIE into extra turns , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to sit down . She smiles and shakes her head . SQUIRE SIMS stands out in the center of the scene , mopping his misty face with his big polka-dotted handkerchief. p. 21 HENRY SIMS Well , that kills off the mulligrubs in we old folks . To JULIE MAE who has sat down and is jiggling the collar of her shirtwaist for air and fanning furiously . Unh , Julie Mae ? JULIE MAE SIMS Happily . We wo n't hardly be able to crawl out'n bed tomorrow . Sims smiles at her . HENRY SIMS In a voice of announcement . Well , folks , you 've turned out to give John Freeman a good welcome home . I 'm mighty glad . He looks about him . He 's an example to all of us  --  what a man can do when he 's determined  --  and especially when he 's got a smart mother behind him . He indicates the embarrassed ELIZABETH over at the left . We a11 knew John 's father back years ago too  --  a good man . GEORGE FARRIS Yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . HENRY SIMS And John 's like him  --  a good man . Solemnly . He wants to stay here and start a school . He stops to let the words sink in . ELLEN FARRIS I reckon our children need schooling . p. 22 LILY MILLER Yeh , they ai n't much book-learning around here . HENRY SIMS Me and Isaac Miller here agree this time  --  and George Farris too . We 've had a sort of board meeting with John , and are willing to back him . Ai n't we , Isaac ? ISAAC MILLER In his deliberate voice . We are that . I think we 're mighty fortunate in having John settle here . We need good teaching like never before . HENRY SIMS I 'd like to hear a word on it from our Honorable Jed Willis  --  what he thinks . JED WILLIS All I got to say is I hope it 'll be the right kind of teaching  --  no northern ideas in it , no Yankeeisms , you know . In times like these you ca n't be too careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we need . And that 's the kind we 're counting on John giving us . The people look at one another appraising the matter . HENRY SIMS A lean-faced narrow-eyed young man of twenty-five  --  finally . What 's it gon na cost ? LILY MILLER You need n't worry  --  you ai n't got any children . ANNABELLE SIMS HENRY 'S pretty little wife  --  sharply . We got one coming . Some of the girls titter. p. 23 HENRY SIMS And I 'm a taxpayer , ai n't I ? CHRIS SLOCUMB And me too . It 's a good question . SIMS gestures to JOHN . HENRY SIMS All right , John . JOHN FREEMAN Simply . If a parent can pay a little something , it 'll be appreciated . But if he ca n't  --  then all right . Maybe he can help with some work . Mr. Miller here has offered us his empty store building . It 'll need repairing  --  new windows and doors , and a new roof  --  ISAAC MILLER Yeh , it ai n't no use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squire Sims here . There is a touch of hidden resentment in his voice . NEILL SIMS An eager young fellow of seventeen . We boys 'll get in there and help John  --  Mr. Freeman  --  me and Otho and Jake and Grover  --  we can saw and nail good as any of ' em . Cai n't we ? JAKE AND GROVER In unison . We kin . OTHO jiggles his violin and nods . MINNIE ROSS Bright and fifteen . And the girls 'll help too  --  we can clean up and sweep and get the trash out'n the yard  --  an  --  Her voice dies out. p. 24 LILY MILLER My chaps have been hasseling for schoolling . I 've taught ' em the best I can at home  --  and now they can really learn . Gazing about her . I think all the mothers here will be mighty thankful to John Freeman . JOHN FREEMAN Enthusiastically . And when we get our building it 'll be big enough for group meetings  --  for the farmers to gather and talk over their problems  --  for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for political meetings , too , Mr. Willis . The people laugh , and WILLIS bows to JOHN , his face unsmiling . And we can have Christmas exercises , spelling bees and box parties in it too . A debating society will be a good thing  --  where the boys and girls can discuss public questions . Yes sir , in time we 'll make it into a neighborhood center , a real center . ISAAC MILLER Gravely but earnestly . This is the beginning of something big , ai n't it , Jed Willis ? JED WILLIS Guardedly . It could be  --  Yes , that 's right- could be . HENRY SIMS Well , John  --  if you get the legislature there behind you  --  Indicating WILLIS.  --  you 're fixed . p. 25 JED WILLIS I say it sounds good  --  looks good  --  that 's all . ISAAC MILLER And John Freeman will make it good . HENRY SIMS You can count on me for window-framing , John , and even some nails and hardware from the store there . He gestures off toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa  --  you do n't want to overdo it . HENRY SIMS Now Henry , do n't be so danged stingy . And George Farris says he 'll furnish lumber from his sawmill . Ai n't that right , George ? GEORGE FARRIS That 's right . ABNER DONOVAN A thin gangling mustached man of fifty-five . But what about Brother Esau ? The scene grows suddenly quiet . REVEREND ESAU MCKEE Calling down from the porch . Now , Abner , never you mind about Brother Esau . He raises his huge gaunt frame and stands on the porch steps . I ai n't worth a cent as a teacher , and you never would n't send more'n four or five younguns to me at a time . All the new-fangled things that people are larning out beyont these Kentucky mountains  --  I ai n't in it . I 've quit . John talked it over with me fust thing . I 'm for him . The new ways take the place of the old , as it 's writ in the holy scriptures  --  second chapter of Mark  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls back . But in the meanwhile time I 'll be in that there church of a Sunday preaching hell fire and damnation on all your sinful souls whatsomever . Let John teach , let Esau preach . The people applaud and laugh . ESAU sits down in his chair and begins to rock violently back and forth again . AUNT PATSY gives her derisive cackle once more and spits by her snuff brush across in front of him . He glares at her and rocks on. p. 26 HENRY SIMS Now how many of you will send your children to school ? Hands up . About half of the parents hold up their hands . That gives you a good start , John . Well , neighbors , glad to have you all here . Now after we get some eatings from our picnic supper we 'll go inside the house from the chill and have more fun . CHRIS SLOCUMB Yeh , let 's eat . My belly thinks my throat 's cut . MARY MILLER His bedraggled wife . Ai n't you got no manners , Chris ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next day or two and see each of you separately about your children and the books they 'll need . OLD EXOM Merrily . De barbecue is ready , Massa Sims , with all the fixments . Yassuh , yassuh . HENRY SIMS Come on , everybody . Exom here and the colored folks are gon na sing for us while we eat . EXOM rings his bell and goes back the way he came , DEBBIE following . The people start jostling toward the left . Sounding across the scene comes the sudden high baying call of a hound , then another . The people stop , listen and then turn back in growing excitement . The barking of the dogs comes pouring onward. p. 27 CHRIS SLOCUMB Excitedly . Fox chase ! He springs over to the porch where the guns are leaning against the side of the house , seizes one and starts to rush off at the right . A number of the young fellows run after him . They stop suddenly as a panting , terrorstricken young Negro FUGITIVE comes dashing in , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he runs . He wears an iron collar around his neck with two outspreading prongs . A tinkling bell is riveted to the collar . He turns wildly about the scene , his hands outstretched in pleading . BEN Help me , folkes , help me ! Dey 's after me ! Dey 's after me ! Halloos are heard near at hand at the right , and the barking grows louder . The FUGITIVE bounds across the scene toward the rear . The people scatter before him , and a few of them , JOHN and ISAAC MILLER included , make obvious efforts to protect him . But some of the others head him off . Most of the women and girls crowd over toward the porch in fright . WOMEN AND GIRLS Ad lib . A slave ! A slave ! It 's a runaway slave ! The FUGITIVE dashes up onto the right roadway , but DAVIE overtakes him and grapples with him . He gets loose and tears back into the yard. p. 28 DAVIE FREEMAN Yelling . Catch him , fellows , catch him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLER step in front of him . DAVIE darts around to get at the Negro who turns and drops helplessly on the ground in front of JOHN , clasping his arms around JOHN 'S legs . DAVIE reaches to pull him away , but JOHN pushes him back . JOHN FREEMAN Let him alone , Davie . ISAAC MILLER Stepping forward . Do n't anybody hurt him . HENRY SIMS Angrily . Isaac Miller , you 're breaking the law by trying to help a runaway slave . ISAAC MILLER Firing up . I got a right to help him . HENRY SIMS You ai n't got any right on my premises , you ai n't . JULIE MAE SIMS Stop it , Martin . You know how Isaac is . CHRIS SLOCUMB Importantly , looking about him . Yeah , a nigger-lover , that 's what ! JULIE MAE SIMS Shut your foolish mouth , Chris Slocumb . SIMS and HENRY go angrily up to MILLER. p. 29 ELSIE SIMS Behave yourself , Pa ! For a moment it looks as if a fight will break out . Offstage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANK OTIS , a deputy sheriff , comes in at the right accompanied by SHAD ROBERTS , a constable . The barking of the dogs has stopped off at the right . BEN To JOHN . I want to get to my Mammy ' crost the river . Help me , white folks , help me ! Great jerking sobs shake him . JOHN looks grievingly down at him . OTIS and ROBERTS come forward . FRANK OTIS A rough but kindly middle-aged man , wearing swamp boots and carrying a pistol in his hand . Thankee , folks . Well , Ben , you see it do n't do no good to run away . We catch you every time . DAVIE and two or three of the young fellows are still bent around JOHN ready to grab the Negro . JOHN is staring down at the cruel iron collar . Suddenly BEN springs up . But DAVIE and the young men grab him and overpower him , the bell jangling violently . ISAAC MILLER starts forward as if to interfere but JOHN catches him by the arm . JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing . OTIS and ROBERTS hurry up and lift the whimpering BEN to his feet. p. 30 BEN Do n't beat me ! Please suh , do n't beat me ! SHAD ROBERTS A young thin-lipped fellow of twenty-five , armed with a rifle . We 'll leave that for your master to do , Ben . He snaps the handcuffs on BEN . Come on . FRANK OTIS Glad we run into you folks . Some of the people back in these mountains have been helping the niggers escape across the river . HENRY SIMS You know , sheriff  --  most of us in this valley are on the right side . I got some slaves myself  --  a few . FRANK OTIS You all go on with your fun . He and ROBERTS lead BEN away at the right . EXOM begins ringing his bell loudly again . JULIE MAE starts shooing the people off toward the waiting supper . JULIE MAE SIMS Get along , everybody  --  get along . To some of the young people who have gone over to the right front , gazing after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of you  --  we 're gon na eat . The young people turn , come back across the scene , and move on off . ISAAC MILLER Lily  --  Grover  --  Avis , come on , we 're going home ! He takes his wife 's arm and turns away . SIMS looks around. p. 31 HENRY SIMS Aw now , Isaac , do n't get all swolled up and leave . ISAAC MILLER I do n't feel like eating your rations , now , Martin Sims . ELSIE runs over to MILLER . ELSIE SIMS Please , Mr. Isaac . ISAAC MILLER Your pa and me do n't agree on a lot of things and never will . ELSIE SIMS But you do agree on the school . HENRY SIMS Yeh , and we do n't have to quarrel here now and ruin the frolic for the young folks . GEORGE FARRIS Yeh , that 's right . No use in quarreling over a mgger . ELSIE SIMS Exom 's got the best barbecue ! AVIS MILLER Please , Pa . MILLER controls his anger , turns and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they go . I 'm glad  --  I wanted to have some more fun so bad ! ELSIE SIMS Come along , John . JOHN stands gazing out before him . DAVIE takes ELSIE 'S hand and pulls her along . WILLIS , who has stayed out of the turmoil , stops by JOHN on his way out. p. 32 JED WILLIS You want your school to succeed , do n't you , John Freeman ? JOHN nods , almost abstractedly . Well , you better watch how you take up for the wrong side . His voice suddenly rough . Or you might find us folks against you  --  and if we got against you that 'd be too bad , would n't it ? JOHN starts to speak . WILLIS puts out a monitoring hand , laughs harshly , then takes JOHN 'S arm half-affectionately and steers him toward the left . The organ slides into the melody of " Jacob 's Ladder " and in the distance the slaves begin singing . JED WILLIS Listen there at that purty music . Who says the slaves ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what we 'll see to in this valley  --  see that folks behave . You hear me , John Freeman ! JOHN FREEMAN Yes , Mr. Willis , I hear you . They go away to the left , and the song of the slaves comes in more clearly . Every round gets higher and higher , Every round gets higher and higher , Every round gets higher and higher , &nbsp; &nbsp; Soldiers of the cross . The singing begins dying away . The organ surges in with a reprise of the song for transition music and the lights fade on out . The organ continues a moment and then dies . The spotlight comes up on the right side stage revealing the NARRATOR. p. 33 THE NARRATOR And there in the valley among his people John Freeman began his school . And as the months went by he taught many a child , big and little , to read and write and to figure . He taught them too about their own proud Scotch-Irish heritage and about the great country of which they were a part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , Madison and other founding fathers , and the principles of justice , freedom , equality and peace which they believed in and on which the mighty republic had been built . And with joyful lifted heart he spoke out for these principles and against violence and war . And in the growing sectional bitterness over slavery , over state 's rights , over the economic differences between the North and the South , it was no wonder that his pro-southern and anti-union neighbors before long began to be suspicious of him and even fearful of his doctrines . But day and night he carried on his work , studying , writing and making his plans for an even bigger and better school . Morning after morning he rang his summoning bell , calling the young people from the hills . p. 34 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONE : Scene III From the darkness of the left center stage a bell begins ringing , and then the voice of JOHN FREEMAN is heard calling . JOHN FREEMAN Books  --  books , come in to books ! The bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the mountainside is heard at the right . The light comes up there , and we see a number of young people on their way to school , small children , girls and boys , and some larger ones , carrying lunch pails and booksacks , some skipping along  --  a sort of choreographed parade . GIRLS ' VOICES Ad lib . Alma 's got some of the sweetest sweetgum.She wo n't let you chew it a lick.Look a-there , my foot 's squashy wet from that mudhole ! I like to go to school the most ! John Freeman says they 're gon na put new footlogs over the creek this year.Yeh , John gets things done . Little FLOYD DUNN and LEXIE TURNER , about twelve , come chasing along , FLOYD with a stick in his hand . FLOYD DUNN I ketched you  --  pizen stick ! pizen stick ! LEXIE TURNER Disgustedly . All right . FLOYD hands him the stick and tears off , with LEXIE after him . The little girls hurry on , some of them running after the boys . NEILL SIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet knowing the path . MINNIE ROSS and RUBY ROBINSON , each sweet sixteen , follow him . MINNIE runs around and blocks his path. p. 35 MINNIE ROSS Mockingly and as if quoting . Neill Sims is the smartest boy in school . NEILL pushes on by and goes his way , never lifting his eyes . RUBY ROBINSON Let him go  --  old bookworm ! ENOCH CAMPBELL and JIMMY DONOVAN , two husky mountain lads of eighteen or nineteen , overtake MINNIE and RUBY . MINNIE ROSS Look what the cat 's drug up . ENOCH CAMPBELL Grinning and falling in step with her . You orter be much obliged to the cat ! JIMMY DONOVAN Walking with RUBY . We could n't stay away if you kept a-going to school . MINNIE ROSS You 'll have to study  --  John Freeman 'll make you study . RUBY ROBINSON He ai n't like Brother Esau McKee . No sir . They go on . MARY MILLER , VIOLA TATE and NORA JONES , pretty , bouncing mountain maids in their teens , come along . They are singing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast , &nbsp; &nbsp; Three times he kissed her chin , But when he kissed her clay-cold lips &nbsp; &nbsp; His heart was broke within . They disappear after the others down the road . Little DORA BROWN , aged twelve , comes along . She calls shrilly behind her. p. 36 DORA BROWN Come on , Paxton , you 're gon na be late for school ! PAXTON BROWN , her brother , about sixteen , comes along with a gun . He is looking off toward the left , evidently stalking some sort of game . PAXTON BROWN Sh  --  sh , I seen a squirrel up that there tree . He creeps off into the woods . DORA hesitates and then runs after him . MARY SLOCUMB , with a baby on her arm , comes in driving her little boy , CHRIS JUNIOR , aged eight , along with a switch . He is squalling . MARY SLOCUMB Git on with you . CHRIS SLOCUMB I want to go rabbit-hunting with Pa . MARY SLOCUMB You got to git you some learning , Chris Slocumb  --  John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to her with one hand , spits on her apron and scrubs behind his ears . I told you about them ' ere ears . Git from here ! She pushes him off , raises her switch and moves toward him . He dashes away . She turns back the way she came . Again the bell rings in the distance , and again JOHN 'S voice is heard calling . JOHN FREEMAN Books  --  books , come in to books ! There is the sound of a shotgun off in the woods . PAXTON comes in , putting a squirrel pridefully into his booksack as he comes . DORA is following closely behind . They hurry on . The light comes up on the left center stage , revealing the interior of the little schoolhouse . We look into the little building as if the front and side walls were off  --  pretty much a constructivist set  --  with a few spaced joists and window frames . A large part of the rear wall is painted black for a blackboard . On it are written the words of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left of the blackboard and near the rear door are two flags on the wall  --  the Stars and Stripes above and the Kentucky flag below . In front of the blackboard is a rough table on which some books are piled . There are some fifteen or twenty students seated on their backless benches , ranging in age from little tots to grown-up young men and women . JOHN FREEMAN is standing by the table with a stout hickory pointer in his hand . We recognize a number of young people from the play-party scene  --  among them are ELSIE SIMS , OTHO TURNER , AVIS MILLER , and GROVER MILLER , as well as those we saw passing on the roadway . ELSIE is bowed over her book studying away . The younger students are singing their arithmetic lesson to the tune of " Yankee-Doodle "  --  some of them in piping shrill voices and others mumbling along in a husky bumble-bee drone. p. 37 JOHN FREEMAN Beaming . Good . That 's better than yesterday . You 've all been studying hard , I see . CHILDREN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another week or two and you 'll know the whole twelve lines . And by the end of the summer you 'll be working problems . That you will . FLOYD DUNN Calling out . Let 's try the fifth line . OTHER VOICES Calling out . Yes , let 's do . REBA MCQUEEN Aged nine . That 's easy . JOHN FREEMAN Yes  --  Beginningly . Five times one are five , five times two are ten  --  it goes right on like that . He turns away to the blackboard . CHILDREN Running gaily on . Five times three is fifteen  --  five times four is twenty  --  five times five is twenty-five  --  And they go on in a chanting sing song . Five times six is thirty , five times seven is thirty-five , five times eight is forty , five times nine is forty-five , five times ten is fifty , five times eleven is fifty-five , five times twelve is sixty . They wind up with a shout , enjoying themselves . Little CHRIS SLOCUMB scurries in suddenly at the rear and gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAXTON BROWN enters with his gun and sits down . He slaps his book bag to one of his cronies , indicating that he got his game . DORA comes quietly in after him . PAXTON makes a big stir of getting busy studying . JOHN turns and calls out to him. p. 38 JOHN FREEMAN The other boys leave their guns at home , Paxton . PAXTON BROWN Yessir . JOHN FREEMAN I asked you to leave yours . PAXTON BROWN Ma 's sick and she wanted me to git her a squirrel for a stew . DORA BROWN It ai n't no lie , Mr. Freeman . JOHN FREEMAN I believe him , Dora . I 'm sorry you children 's mother is ' sick and I 'll get by to see her tonight . But leave your gun Quickly . Yessir . JOHN FREEMAN Looking ' out happily over the classroom . Last year you know we were lucky enough to get a few books from the teachers at Berea . Now we 've got a lot more . He indicates the books on the table . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a great thing for us and we are thankful . And it 's good news that Mr. Fee is coming by to see our school . Picking up some of the books . There 's some stories here and good Bible readings  --  history and poetry  --  Pilgrim 's Progress  --  Some of the students stand up to get a better view of the books.  --  two McGuffey readers and an extra blue-back speller . I 'll lend these out to you one by one . Several hands go up asking for the books . And I know you 'll take good care of them . Yes , we 're really getting us a school library . We need us a bookcase . Calling out . Paxton , you 're handy with a hammer and saw . Maybe you could take charge of that . We could make us some drawings to show how it ought to be made . p. 39 PAXTON BROWN Now all attention . Yessir , I 'll be glad to do it . JOHN FREEMAN And you , Otho Turner , can help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to help ? A number of hands go up . JOHN smiles . Good . Well , I can see we 're going to have our bookcase . And now we 're going to sing our song for the day . You little folks that ca n't read the words yet can hum along . He turns toward the blackboard , but at this moment MR . FEE comes in from the left and stands in the door . JOHN does not see him at first . Several of the students begin clearing their throats and pointing . JOHN turns around . He hurries forward to shake FEE 'S hand . Come in , Mr. Fee , come in ! FEE comes in . He is a breezy genial man of middle age . REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Good morning , John Freeman . Go right ahead and let me listen . JOHN FREEMAN No sir , we 're going to listen to you . Young folks , this is the Reverend John Gregg Fee . You 've heard me speak about him so much . You see , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thank you enough . There is quite a stir among the students over the visitor . It is obvious that they are remembering some of the gossip about FEE from their parents . JIMMY DONOVAN and ENOCH CAMPBELL stand up as if to leave the room . JOHN calls out to them . Jimmy , you and Enoch  --  we are counting on you to help us build that bookcase . p. 40 ENOCH CAMPBELL To JIMMY . I reckon we 'd better stay  --  REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE With a little infectious laugh . I can see some of you have heard bad news about me . But I 'm perfectly harmless . I do n't wear a long tail hidden under my coat , nor are my feet forked . Some of the students laugh . I do n't carry a gun either and never will  --  only a Bible . He takes a Bible out of his pocket and holds it in his hand . JIMMY and ENOCH look about them , and RUBY and MINNIE make frantic pantomime with their hands for them to behave themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and sits down , leaving FEE free to speak . You have got a mighty fine school here . I can see that . And you are lucky . There are thousands and thousands of fine young people like you back in these mountains who do n't have such a chance as you 've got . And I hope when you 're finished here a lot of you will go on to college and get your education  --  you can somehow if you just will  --  like Mr. Freeman here , and come back into the hills and help others as he 's helping you . We need many , many more schools like this  --  many more in this great stretch of Appalachian country running from Pennsylvania down to Georgia . And there 's no greater work to prepare yourselves for . Every man , every woman is a sort of teacher in fact . The example that he sets in his life , in her life , is a kind of teaching . And the purpose of education , young folks , as I see it , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will make their lives the right example for others . That 's what we 're trying to do in our small way at Berea . We are trying to do it honestly and without fear or favor , without prejudice and without discrimination . We are encountering difficulties . But we have faith that these will pass away . Quietly but earnestly . We try to train our boys and girls not only to know the truth out of good books , out of the Bible and literature , but to learn how to do things with their hands . We believe in training the whole person  --  his mind , his soul and his body , his . hands . We try to teach our students how to farm better , how to make better homes , how to  --  At this moment several men appear in the scene from the left . Among them are JED WILLIS , SQUIRE SIMS , HENRY SIMS , FRANK OTIS , SHAD ROBERTS , and ABNER DONOVAN . They come on into the room , WILLIS in front . OTIS and ROBERTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , Mr. Fee , you can stop right there . JOHN FREEMAN Stepping forward , astounded . Mr. Willis  --  please  --  Mr. Sims ! JED WILLIS Do n't get on a high horse , John Freeman . We 're just sending Mr. Fee back to where he belongs . JIMMY has seen his father , ABNER DONOVAN , enter , and he and ENOCH start creeping out at the rear . ABNER DONOVAN Loudly . What are you doing here , Jimmy ? JOHN FREEMAN He 's started to school . ABNER DONOVAN Get on back home , boy . I 'll tell you when you can go to this school . JOHN FREEMAN But , Mr. Donovan  --  JIMMY and ENOCH go out . NEILL and a number of students are now standing excitedly up . SIMS turns to JOHN . HENRY SIMS Firmly and kindly . I know how you feel , John  --  Mr. Fee being your old teacher . You think it 's all right to have him visit your school . But it 's not . We do n't want him talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want to hear him talk . TWO OR THREE OTHER VOICES Yes , let him talk . HENRY SIMS Sternly . Sit down , Neill . Before his father 's will , NEILL yields and sinks down on his bench . You should n't have invited him here , John . REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Apparently undisturbed . He did n't invite me . I came by my own free will . I wanted to see his school . John 's doing a great work here and we all ought to be proud of him . JED WILLIS It 's not a great work if you ask me-letting young people 's heads get filled with the wrong ideas . HENRY SIMS Placatingly . If John 's made a mistake this time I know he wo n't repeat it . JOHN FREEMAN Trying to control his feelings . I do n't count it a mistake . JED WILLIS Confirmingly . Uh-huh ! HENRY SIMS Mr. Fee 's been having a lot of trouble over in Madison County , John . We do n't want him to bring that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in you and this school . p. 43 JOHN FREEMAN He 's not bringing any trouble . He 'd started telling the girls and boys some good things . And they ought to have a chance to hear him . HENRY SIMS You tell ' em good things , John . That 's what we 've hired you for . JED WILLIS Pointing to the wall where the flags are stretched out . Aha  --  He moves over to the flag . What I want to know is why our Kentucky flag ai n't on top ? JOHN FREEMAN Quietly . Because the flag of our nation comes first . JED WILLIS Well , men , you see with your own eyes . If this ai n't Yankeeism I do n't know what it is . I ask you , John Freeman  --  are you for Kentucky or against her ? JOHN FREEMAN I am for all the states together . SEVERAL CHILDREN 'S VOICES In unison . A nation united , one and indivisible . JED WILLIS To JOHN . We 'll see more about this . He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts forward but JOHN catches his arm and stops him . Now you change places with them flags . He turns usheringly toward FEE . Go along , Mr. Fee . We ask you . p. 44 REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Touching JOHN 'S arm . I 'll finish my talk for you maybe another day , John . To SIMS . Squire Sims , we all appreciate what you 've done in getting the school started . SIMS turns about in sudden embarrassment . FEE holds his hand out to him . SIMS hesitates and then hastily shakes it . WILLIS lays the flag on the table . I have no ill will to you  --  but help John to keep on . The children need this school . To the students . You young folks study hard and obey your teacher . And read your Bible . And when you say your prayers at night pray that these misunderstandings will soon fade away and that we all can continue to live as brothers one with another . And patience , John , patience . He walks out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivering with anger which he controls . The men follow FEE off . The students are mumbling among themselves . NEILL SIMS Almost with a cry . Why did n't you stop ' em ? JOHN gazes at NEILL saying nothing . NEILL sits down again , and angrily grabs up his book . The scene quiets down , the young folks looking toward JOHN , waiting . JOHN goes over and determinedly replaces the flag on the wall where it was before. p. 45 JOHN FREEMAN We 'll sing our song now . He turns toward the blackboard and with his pointing stick indicates the words . ELSIE leads off the song . JOHN and then the others join in until all are singing . The scene begins to fade out . The organ comes in swallowing up the voices of the singers in its loud carrying on of the song . The transition music continues until the stage is dark , and then the light comes up on the left side stage. p. 46 Act 1 , Scene 4 ACT ONE : Scene IV The Sims living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plain but comfortable place of yeoman farmer type . A window is at the back with bright flowery curtains , a table beside it . A crayon portrait or two is on the wall and a large handwoven rug on the floor . A door on the right leads to the outside and another door at the left rear leads into the kitchen . A fireplace is over at the right rear , and between it and the rear door a dresser with a mirror above it . When the light comes up JULIE MAE SIMS , her daughter-in-law ANNABELLE , and old DEBBIE are in the foreground standing around a quilting frame , sewing away on a brightly patterned quilt . ANNABELLE is singing a ballad in a clear high voice and JULIE MAE is following along in a sort of drone alto . NEILL SIMS is seated near the fireplace buried in a book , and ELSIE SIMS is standing in front of the dresser mirror fixing her hair . ELSIE now joins in the song with her clear voice , but somewhat abstractedly . THE THREE WOMEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bird that flies so high , I 'd flutter down to my true lover , &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his breast so close I 'd lie . p. 47 ANNABELLE SIMS My grandmammy used to sing that there ballad . JULIE MAE SIMS It 's been handed on down in these mountains  --  handed on down . Turning and calling . Neill , go bring some wood in and put on the fire . This fall weather 's getting mighty sharp . NEILL makes no reply but goes on with his reading . Books , books , never seen such a fellow ! Wonder he do n't put his eyes slam out reading . First thing you know that boy 'll be talking about going off to college and like as not becoming a school teacher same as John Freeman . ELSIE SIMS John says he could almost teach right now , he 's learned so fast these two years . JULIE MAE SIMS Well , your Pa would never hear to it . Neill 's got to carryon the farm here . To DEBBIE . You can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Squire wants you to be in your cabin by dark . DEBBIE Yes 'm . She rises . JULIE MAE goes to the mantelpiece and brings a bottle . JULIE MAE SIMS And here 's some good mullein tonic I made for Exom 's rheumatism . DEBBIE Making her curtsey . Thanky , missus . It 'll please um so . p. 48 JULIE MAE SIMS And help him too . DEBBIE Good night , you all . OTHERS Good night , Debbie . DEBBIE goes out at the rear . JULIE MAY follows after her , peers out through the door , then closes it . JULIE MAE SIMS Debbie ai n't like herself lately . You notice it ?  --  nor Exom and the other slaves either . Ever since that old John Brown 's raid ' cross the river they 're acting funny . Resuming her sewing . They do n't talk much  --  like they 're plotting something . Makes me plumb oneasy , it does . You ca n't tell what they 're thinking . ELSIE SIMS That 'd break poor old Debbie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . She loves us all . You know she does . JULIE MAE SIMS And we love them . That 's what hurts so . Oh  --  this mommick and mixtry and stirring ' em all up ! Loudly . Go get that wood , Neill . I keep telling you . NEILL gets up , lays aside his book , then speaks suddenly and emphatically in the air . NEILL SIMS I aim to go to college  --  and I aim to be a school teacher like John Freeman . He goes quickly out of the room at the rear p. 49 JULIE MAE SIMS Aha , you hear that ! What 'd I tell you ? He aggervates me , he does . She shakes her head and sews on . ANNABELLE SIMS Staring at the quilt . That Ocean Wave pattern 's the purtiest I 've ever seen . JULIE MAE SIMS Brusquely . Yes , it 's purty . ANNABELLE SIMS I believe to my soul Elsie do n't care a bit and grain for it  --  and she started it herself months ago  --  started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around again . Ai n't you gon na put on that new taffety dress for Davie ? He 'd like that . ELSIE SIMS No , I ain't.  --  Correcting herself.  --  I 'm not . We 're just going to a cornshucking . JULIE MAE SIMS A man likes a woman to look her best . Used to you 'd spend an hour in front of that mirror fixing up when Davie was a-coming . What 's happened to you ? ANNABELLE SIMS With a giggle . If I was purty as Elsie I 'd be there half the day looking at myself a-grinning and a-gaping . JULIE MAE SIMS Sharply . If you 're cooling off on Davie ' cause of his brother John , then you 're foolisher than I thought . You listen to me . Davie would provide for a woman , he would . John Freeman with his books and quare ideas never would . p. 50 ELSIE SIMS His ideas are not quare , as you call it . He 's trying to build up a good school here in the valley . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe not . But he ought not to keep making them speeches round about and writing things in the paper the way he does . Last Sunday he had to get up in church and beg people to stay quiet , to keep peaceful . Good gracious alive , folks have got to be ready to defend their rights  --  their property  --  keep the Yankees from running over us . ELSIE SIMS John do n't believe in guns and killings . Maybe he 's right . When he was a little boy he saw his own father shot down trying to stop a feud . JULIE MAE SIMS Reckon I know that . People said Luke Freeman was a fool to go walking out in front of them guns , holding up his hands saying , stop it , neighbors  --  stop the killing . And he got a bullet through him , poor man . Yes , he was a good man , but he was foolish . ELSIE SIMS But it stopped the feud . People were ashamed . It stopped the killing . JULIE MAE SIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love John Freeman . ELSIE SIMS With a little embarrassed laugh . He 's got no time for  --  for that . He thinks of nothing but his school  --  teaching the boys and girls . And I respect him , Ma , I do . He makes you want to be something  --  to look out beyond these hills  --  no longer shut up here lonesome and ground down . p. 51 JULIE MAE SIMS I do n't know as how the folks hereabout are so lonesome . And I ai n't never felt ground down . ANNABELLE SIMS Lord , I 'd feel lonesome and lost if I was anywheres else ! JULIE MAE SIMS Amen ! She and ANNABELLE go on sewing . SQUIRE SIMS enters at the rear , comes over and stands by the fireplace warming himself . He lifts a shot gun from against the wall and looks at it . HENRY SIMS A steady stream of people coming by the store all day . Ai n't an ounce of shot and powder left nor a gun . I got to get off an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared , I tell you . Looking over at ELSIE . The time has come when the trouble-makers had better keep their mouths shut in this valley . JULIE MAE SIMS Just pime blank what I been telling Elsie . HENRY SIMS Pulling a newspaper from his pocket and slapping it . Here in " The Mountain Democrat " it tells about this Abe Lincoln making his redhot speeches up in New York . And another thing  --  there 's another piece in here John Freeman wrote about him , praising him ! He 's a fool to keep writing such stuff . He throws the paper across on to the table. p. 52 ELSIE SIMS John says Lincoln believes in peace and holding the country together . She picks up the paper and opens it . HENRY SIMS Lincoln believes in freeing the niggers . We folks in the South ai n't gon na stand much more , I tell you . Us that have got slaves are gon na keep ' em come hell or high water . And besides , we 're responsible for ' em  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted and trompled on by them Yankees . We got rights and we 're gon na uphold ' em . JULIE MAE SIMS So I told her . HENRY SIMS Hush , woman . The North 's been trying to take over the South for a generation or more . They once had slaves up there in the old days  --  too cold for ' em . So they sold ' em to us for good cash money . Now they 're trying to take ' em away from us  --  crying out pore nigger , pore nigger . He blows angrily into the barrel of the gun , then leans it against the wall and sits down to lace his shoes tighter . He straightens up , holding a book in his hand . Another one of these-here danged books ! He looks at the book , then throws it across the scene just as NEILL enters with an armful of wood . NEILL drops the wood on the hearth and runs over and gets his book . NEILL SIMS His voice quivering . You got no right to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it belongs to the school . p. 53 HENRY SIMS Yeah , and I reckon this John Marshall was another one of them radicals . NEILL SIMS And I reckon he was a great man  --  Chief Justice of the United States . He turns and goes angrily out of the room into the kitchen , smoothing the leaves of the book as he goes . HENRY SIMS Throwing out his hands . Well , there you are , Elsie , right before your eyes . You see he 's got no respect for his father any longer . Angrily . I begin to think I was wrong ever to help John Freeman start that school . DAVIE comes in at the rear . DAVIE FREEMAN Evening , everybody . DAVIE is all dressed up and carries a package in his hand . THE FAMILY Hi , Davie . You 're looking mighty spry . Elsie here 's about ready . DAVIE FREEMAN Yeh , I feel mighty spry . Hi , Elsie . ELSIE SIMS Howdy , Davie . DAVIE FREEMAN My , you 're looking pretty as a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . He opens his package and pulls out a bright shawl . JULIE MAE and ANNABELLE reach out and feel it. p. 54 JULIE MAE SIMS Ai n't that fine ! ANNABELLE SIMS Oh my ! Cashmere ! ELSIE takes it , pleasure showing in her face . She drapes it about herself before the mirror . ELSIE SIMS It 's beautiful , Davie . DAVIE FREEMAN I took my tobacco over to town . I got a good price for it too . And I saw this here in the store . That 'll look just right around her hair , I said , and her face like a rosebud peeping out . ELSIE SIMS Oh , Davie . She caresses the shawl , then pulls it to frame her face , giving him a sudden smile . HENRY SIMS How 're things in town ? DAVIE FREEMAN Lord , I never seen such a stir  --  fist fights breaking out all in the streets . I 'd a-liked to got into some of ' em but I had to come on back . HENRY SIMS Seems there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I ai n't studying war nor any other trouble right now . Me'n Elsie are going to have some fun . He suddenly grabs ELSIE and whirls her about the room . Yes sir , we got a lot of dancing to do . And I bet I find three or four red ears in old Donovan 's corn pile  --  and every red ear means  --  you know what ! He kisses his fingers in the air . Goodbye , you all . Do n't look for us till you see us coming . He and ELSIE start away , ELSIE giving her mother a little affectionate kiss on the top of her head as she passes . DAVIE turns back to SIMS . About that meeting  --  count me in. p. 55 HENRY SIMS Knowed we could . DAVIE and ELSIE go out . JULIE MAE SIMS Looking after them . They make a mighty fitting couple . HENRY SIMS They do that . ANNABELLE SIMS John can give Elsie a book but Davie gives her a purty shawl . I 'll bet on Davie . JULIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in . ANNABELLE SIMS You 're finished at the store , Henry ? HENRY SIMS Yeah , all locked up . HENRY SIMS And barred ? HENRY SIMS Yeah , barred ! He goes across the room , gets a gun from behind the dresser and comes back and stands by the fire examining it . JULIE MAE SIMS What 's the meaning of all these guns at this time of night ? HENRY SIMS Me'n Pa 's got a little meeting . ANNABELLE SIMS What 's the meeting about , Henry ? HENRY SIMS Ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies . He reaches over and pats ANNABELLE affectionately on the hair . She seizes his hand and kisses it . SIMS gets up. p. 56 HENRY SIMS We 'll be back late tonight . ANNABELLE SIMS Be careful , Henry . HENRY SIMS Oh , shore . There 's some of the fellows now . He comes by ANNABELLE , squeezes her to him in a hug and goes on out . Several armed men come down the roadway in front of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIMS and HENRY go out to meet them , carrying their guns . SIMS has picked up a Bible from the dresser . JED WILLIS Right on the dot . HENRY SIMS All set . They move on off down the road into the darkness . ANNABELLE SIMS Oh Lord , I hope there ai n't gon na be any trouble . JULIE MAE SIMS We 've already got trouble . They sew away . ANNABELLE raises her song again , and JULIE MAE joins irritatedly in . ANNABELLE AND JULIE MAE I wish I never had a-courted , &nbsp; &nbsp; Or found that love 's so hard to gain.I 'd a-shut my heart in a box all golden &nbsp; &nbsp; And locked it up with a silver chain . They go on singing as the scene fades out . The organ reprises a bit of the melody and then dies as the light comes up on the right side stage. p. 57 Act 1 , Scene 5 ACT ONE : Scene V In the woods , an hour later . A hidden fire is glowing behind a boulder and casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men are standing around the fire , their stiff figures outlined in the red , jumping light . The mood of the scene is as if some sort of mystic or infernal ritual were about to take place . JED WILLIS Gruffly . This seems about all tonight . FRANK OTIS Likewise . Enough to start with . JED WILLIS What about Davie Freeman ? ABNER DONOVAN He 'll be with us when we need him . HENRY SIMS A hundred percent . JED WILLIS In solemn announcement . This is an organization meeting of the Knights of the White Star  --  a committee for law and order . HENRY SIMS Frankly as is his way . Right . Everything peaceable and according to law . JED WILLIS Chuckling grimly . Yeh , peace and quiet . That 's what we aim to have hereabouts . HENRY SIMS Sternly . And no bloodshed . p. 58 JED WILLIS You being a J.P . can make it more binding , more legal , Squire . All right , Sheriff . FRANK OTIS Intoning . I now appoint each and every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law . JED WILLIS Will ye serve ? OTHERS We will . JED WILLIS Swiftly . And each man has got to make himself a sort of committee of one to report all suspicious happenings whatsoever at our weekly meetings . FRANK OTIS Right . VOICES Right . FRANK OTIS And the slaves ? JED WILLIS All to be in their quarters at dark , I say . HENRY SIMS Them 's the orders I 've already give mine . JED WILLIS And no wandering on the roads at night  --  or they 're liable to get shot . FRANK OTIS And the free niggers ? JED WILLIS To be attended to . HENRY SIMS Amen to that . They 're getting so they come into the store and act uppity . Do n't take off their hat . p. 59 JED WILLIS Slapping a paper in his hand . The list right here  --  the names of every one in this valley . FRANK OTIS We 'll teach ' em to take off their hats to the white man . HENRY SIMS Take off more'n that  --  yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeh , teach that Murdock McGill to take his'n off . HENRY SIMS Now do n't be ready to go off half-cocked , Henry . Maybe a man 's got a right to wear his own hat even if he is as black as the ace of spades . HENRY SIMS Angrily . There you are , Pa  --  there you are  --  always too wishy-washy . HENRY SIMS We want to deal with the real trouble when it comes , Henry , not waste time on every little picayunish thing . JED WILLIS Right . Like over in Madison County . They 're organized there with their committee  --  and look out , old Gregg Fee and John Rogers . Reckon you heard about them Sharp rifles they smuggled into Berea in a trunk . HENRY SIMS That might be just a rumor . HENRY SIMS throws out his hands irritatedly . JED WILLIS Rumor or not , it shows how the wind blows . p. 60 LEXIE TURNER And some of our neighbors down here might be getting a batch of them there rifles from Berea . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JED WILLIS This committee will be ready for ' em . Slapping the paper in his hand . Every name right here  --  we got to watch ' em , be vigilant , whether neighbor , kinsman , brother even  --  makes no difference-watch ' em . FRANK OTIS Watch ' em . HENRY SIMS That 'll go for old Isaac Miller and his family . I 'll keep my eye on him . JED WILLIS Right , Henry , right . Harshly . For this ai n't no play party , ai n't no swinging to " Old Dan Tucker " with a purty girl on your arm . It 's the real business  --  the lash , the rifle , the . knife in the guts , if it comes to that . FRANK OTIS Looking around him . In it to the last or not ? Say so . JED WILLIS If there 's any quitting do it now . MEN Ad lib . No sir . We 're right in here . We 're sticking together . WILLIS and OTIS hold up their hands , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 61 WILLIS AND OTIS In unison . You solemnly promise to uphold the supremacy of the white race ? MEN In unison . We do . WILLIS AND OTIS And stand ready at any minute to defend our rights and our property as free men ? MEN We swear . HENRY SIMS As WILLIS and OTIS look at him . I so confirm it . WILLIS unrolls a long terrifying hood which he has held wadded in his hand and lifts it up before him . It is marked with a great white star . JED WILLIS And each man will provide himself with this garment  --  the dress and symbol of knighthood . FRANK OTIS And will wear it on all occasions of business for the Supreme Commander . He indicates WILLIS as the Commander . MEN Some of them excitedly . We will . We will . WILLIS pulls the hood over his head and shoulders . They all gaze at him with a touch of fear , even awe . The men now step forward around the fire and lay their hands on the Bible which SIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 JED WILLIS We swear on pain of grievous punishment never to reveal the name of any of our members . MEN We swear . JED WILLIS And to all our commands , statutes , promises and covenants we do declare our obedience . MEN We do . JED WILLIS Even unto death . MEN Even unto death . JED WILLIS Loudly . To this we pledge our blood . MEN We pledge our blood . JED WILLIS In the name of Almighty God , Amen . MEN In the name of Almighty God , Amen . HENRY SIMS Concludingly . And so kiss His holy Book ! They all pass the Bible around , kissing it . The organ begins Playing a modal reprise of the preceding ballad , and then surges in more loudly as the scene blacks out . The music continues into its transition effect and then dies . The light comes up on the right center stage. p. 63 Act 1 , Scene 6 ACT ONE : Scene VI A room in the Freeman home , evening some months later . The interior is pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better-to-do than that of most such houses . A door at the back leads into a lean-to , and a door at the right into another part of the house . A fireplace is at the left . Several ears of corn and pepper pods hang from the rear walls . And a large crayon portrait of Luke Freeman , JOHN 'S father , is above the mantel . DAVIE with his sleeves rolled up is sitting at the rough center table finishing his supper . UNCLE EPH is sitting in a chair by the fireplace at the left , half-slothfully carding cotton . ELIZABETH stands near him at her large spinning wheel , working away . DAVIE FREEMAN Jubilantly as he eats . You shore cook good rations , Ma . He forks out another piece of meat and goes on eating it . ELIZABETH And I like to see you eat , Davie , after all the hard work you do . Wonder you do n't kill yourself in them fields  --  up at the crack of day and working on by dusk till there ai n't a glimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . A little cuttingly . Somebody 's got to support this family . p. 64 UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Uh-huh ! ELIZABETH I wish poor John had your appetite . DAVIE FREEMAN Lightly . You see , I ai n't educated  --  and I can eat . I ai n't trying to save the world , either . ELIZABETH John worries too much . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Do n't he ? ELIZABETH Especially lately . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS He worries about his school . He picks up a large piece of cardboard some three feet square standing against the wall nearby and gazes at it admiringly . I declare that new school building he 's drawed is just as purty as a pitcher . Think of him being able to do that with pencil and paper  --  all laid out with the trees around it and the playground marked off and a shop there for the boys and girls to work and weave in . It orter be framed and hung up on the wall . He holds it up high for a better view . DAVIE pushes himself back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when John gets that school built . DAVIE rises and comes over to the fire . DAVIE FREEMAN And it 'll be a long day in coming if you ask me . He sits down and stretches his feet out. p. 65 ELIZABETH When John sets his head he 's mighty hard to stop . DAVIE FREEMAN He 's stubborn all right . Of all the fool things  --  to go up there clean to Frankfort to argue with Governor Magoffin about them Berea folks ! Squire Sims asked him not to do it . Did n't do no good . He 's got to go  --  just got to go ! ELIZABETH Mr. Rogers and Mr. Hanson sent for him and asked him to . He thought it was his duty . DAVIE FREEMAN Yeah  --  duty . Lord knows what 's going to happen to him . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Setting here at night and hearing him talk about his plans makes me want to go to school even . I 'm for John . DAVIE FREEMAN Well , you better not go blabbing it round and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against John the way they have . Look how he 's got all the young people interested in studying . And there ai n't so much fighting and drinking of liquor among the young fellows as they used to be . DAVIE FREEMAN Well , I can tell you this , people in this valley are getting enough of him . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Ai n't it something when a man 's own brother turns against him ! And I know why . p. 66 DAVIE FREEMAN Loudly . I got a little sense , I reckon . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Slyly . Here , drink this . It 'll make you forget your gal trouble . He pours liquor into a tin cup and hands it over to DAVIE . DAVIE looks at him , takes the cup and drains the liquor down . UNCLE EPH pours himself a drink and gulps it off . DAVIE FREEMAN I do n't know as how I 've got any gal trouble . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Elsie 's purty enough to make a man twist in his bed all night with the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprout a gal gim me the cold shoulder for another fellow , and what 'd I do ? I said you just go and jump into the Kaintucky River . And danged if she did n't do it . DAVIE FREEMAN Angrily . And so you married that old liquor jug there instead ! UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Plaintively . Go ahead and throw off on me if you want to  --  make fun of a poor old man . I know I ai n't never amounted to nothing . I know that . But John , he never throws off on me . DAVIE FREEMAN Angrily . Yeh , John , John ! You always was a fool about him . p. 67 UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Women , I say , Davie . Well , do n't think you 're the only one ai n't never understood ' em . Solomon married a thousand , and the more he married the worse off he got . Chuckling . Must a-been a plumb nightmare when bedtime come . He begins working away , carding his cotton irritatedly . Suddenly he lifts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good song . We used to sing it marching along that time we followed Old Cash Clay clean across the Rio Grande fighting them Mexicans , fighting for liberty and the U.S.A. I got a bullet in this here knee for my country . And never a bit of pension-not a brownie . DAVIE FREEMAN You 'll be too old to fight in the war that 's coming , Uncle Eph . You wo n't have to worry . ELIZABETH They ai n't any war coming , Davie . DAVIE FREEMAN People have got to change a lot if it do n't . He stares at the fire . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Wars and rumors of wars , the Bible says . He leads off in the song again , beating a rhythmic foot against the floor . His spirit 's gone to worlds unknown , &nbsp; &nbsp; His body lies there in the tomb , And there must lie till that great day &nbsp; &nbsp; When hills and mountains melt away . JOHN comes quietly in at the rear and goes over to the fire . His clothes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . I 'll get you some supper . JOHN pulls off his overcoat , shakes it above the hearth , lays it on a chair and rubs his fingers back through his thick hair . His face is heavy and moody . ELIZABETH picks up the coffee pot from the hearth and goes over to the table . JOHN FREEMAN The snow 's just coming down outside . DAVIE FREEMAN Did you see the governor ? JOHN FREEMAN I did . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Think of that  --  you had a talk with the great governor . JOHN FREEMAN Yes , talk ! That 's all I had . DAVIE FREEMAN So he did n't listen to you ? JOHN FREEMAN We presented the petition . He handed it back . " There 's nothing I can do , " he said , " nothing I can do . " DAVIE FREEMAN Well , what did you expect him to say . JOHN FREEMAN I expected him to be a man , to do his duty as he swore in his oath of office . I expected him to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JOHN FREEMAN Loudly . Yes , innocent , and helpless . But no , no . He shook his head " If the fellow-citizens say that these Berea teachers must leave Kentucky , " he said , " then they 've got to go . Meeting dismissed . " p. 69 DAVIE FREEMAN Satirically . He 's like you  --  he wants to keep the peace . Yawning . Well , I 'm glad they did n't put you in jail . Rising . I 'm going to bed . JOHN FREEMAN Passionately . But think of it  --  they 're driving those teachers from their homes . The school at Berea 's being stopped . And there 's nobody to help them , no body . I 've tried to . DAVIE FREEMAN Good riddance , all of ' em  --  I say . JOHN FREEMAN And I tell you it 'll be a blot on the history of this state as long as time lasts . DAVIE starts toward the lean-to and then turns back . DAVIE FREEMAN Angrily . You ca n't blame folks for getting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , preaching race trouble and murder . JOHN FREEMAN Loudly . They 've never preached that and you know it . DAVIE FREEMAN They hung old John Brown as a sample and they 're going to hang plenty more before this thing 's over . ELIZABETH Please , Davie . A NEGRO MAN and a little BOY Come to the rear door. p. 70 MURDOCK MCGILL Calling . Heigho , everybody . JOHN FREEMAN Looking out and then calling . Come on in , Murdock . The NEGRO comes on into the room and stands with his hat off . His little BOY enters with him . MURDOCK MCGILL Evening , you all . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Howdy , Murdock . How 're your folks ? MURDOCK MCGILL Well as common , sir . JOHN FREEMAN I promised Murdock a book for his little boy . He goes over to the table in the corner , gets the book and brings it back . MURDOCK MCGILL I 'm trying to teach Pete here and my little girl , Lois , to read . Mr. John promised to lend us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN FREEMAN See , it 's got pictures in it . You study and learn fast , Pete . Maybe I can come by some night and help you . He hands him the book . PETE shows his delight . MURDOCK MCGILL Bowing . Thank you sir , thank you sir . Goodnight , everybody . Say thanky. p. 71 PETE MCGILL Thanky , Mister John . MURDOCK and PETE go out at the rear . DAVIE FREEMAN Exploding . Great goodness ! ELIZABETH Come on , John , and get you something to eat . JOHN FREEMAN I 'm not hungry . ELIZABETH Pouring a cup of coffee . Here , you got to drink some coffee anyhow . JOHN smiles his thanks , takes the cup of coffee and drinks a sip or two , then sets it aside . DAVIE FREEMAN Staring at him . You get worse . Now you 're helping the niggers to read and write  --  free niggers at that ! I tell you , John , things are going to bust loose in this country  --  His voice quivering with anger.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREEMAN Flaring out . And what about you ? You and your gang of nightriders  --  going about wearing hoods and threatening people ! You 've got Isaac Miller 's womenfolks scared half to death . DAVIE FREEMAN Shut up , will you ! Shut up ! He draws back his fist as if he would strike JOHN . He goes swiftly into the lean-to and slams the door , then opens it , comes back and kisses his mother . Goodnight , Ma. p. 72 ELIZABETH Goodnight , son . He closes the door and she stands by the table , her face a little bleak . Oh John , do n't quarrel with him . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS And I reckon it 's Davie quarreling with him , ' Lizbeth . ELIZABETH And I 'd say shut your mouth , Eph Cummings ! UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS All right , all right . He pours himself another drink . Looks like after being out in all that cold you might have a little toddy , John . JOHN shakes his head and says nothing , staring ahead of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudders and rises . Do n't fret , boy . Get some good sleep . Do n't fret . He turns undecidedly about , then goes into the lean-to yawning as he goes . JOHN begins pacing back and forth in the room . ELIZABETH You orter eat something , John  --  to keep up your strength . JOHN shakes his head . Resignedly she begins clearing away the dishes . JOHN FREEMAN Passionately . Think of the work they 've put into that school  --  now ended . And the little children and mothers driven away homeless ! He picks up the cardboard and stares at it with heavy face . Yes , and now Jed Willis is trying to end my school . p. 73 ELIZABETH No , John ! JOHN FREEMAN He is  --  and others with him . Sometimes at night I wake up , a sick feeling running all over me and a cold sweat  --  hearing the voices of my neighbors , seeing their faces turned from me  --  the people I love against me . He lays the cardboard aside . I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I believe is right . Fiercely . And it is right ! ELIZABETH We 've got to keep praying that these troubles will pass . Every night on my knees I pray . JOHN FREEMAN How can I teach the things they want me to teach ? The students have a right to know the truth of history . They 've got to know what the facts are . ELIZABETH But if Jed Willis and Squire Sims turn against you how can you carry on your school ? The people follow them . JOHN FREEMAN And if I lose my school I 've failed in everything  --  failed . And because of Squire Sims and others in this valley that own slaves  --  most of the folks are against the Union . They believe in Secession . Yes , they believe in taking up arms and fighting a war . I can never believe in that . I can never teach that . ELIZABETH I still have faith that God will spare us from any war . p. 74 JOHN FREEMAN War is an evil made by man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where is the man ? President Buchanan has no influence . Governor Magoffin straddles the fence . Senator Crittenden tries and tries for peace but nobody hears him . It 's like a madness seized upon the world . Yeh , a madness in which you and other poor women  --  innocent ones  --  will be caught and broken . He goes over to the door and stands looking out . Ah , God , there ought to be something men could guide by in this darkness  --  something steady and true like the star above the mountains there . Turning back into the room . And there is , Ma . Here in my heart I know it  --  it 's the truth that 's written down  --  written in the New Testament , in our Constitution , in our Declaration of Independence . The principles are there , the guide is there . Mr. Fee and Mr. Rogers have the right to speak the truth as they see it , to be free to teach it , to write , to talk  --  and now they 're denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm . ELIZABETH Somehow it will all work out . I believe it , I trust in God . JOHN FREEMAN Shaking his head . It wo n't work out unless men make it work out . p. 75 ELIZABETH Come to bed , please . You 're dead tired . JOHN takes her by the arms and stares into her face . JOHN FREEMAN I know what you have endured and suffered  --  all these years of hardship and poverty  --  so me and Davie could have a chance  --  him to build up his farm and amount to something in the neighborhood and me to go to school , to learn so that I could teach others . And now I fail you . It kills me to think of failing you . ELIZABETH Holding him to her . You do n't fail me . I 'm proud of both my boys  --  proud . She wipes her eyes , kisses him and clings to him a moment . Then she lifts her head . Back long ago I did n't ask your poor father to change  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . I believe God is in your heart , John . You must do what you have to do . I wo n't try to change you . I 'll pray , just keep praying . She turns and goes quickly into her room at the left . JOHN gazes after her , then picks up the cardboard again , lays it aside and sits to the little table . He pulls some sheets of paper to him , takes a pencil from his pocket , stares at the paper , twists his head in weariness , then leans forward and begins to write . The light irises down on him . The words he is putting on paper come in over the mike in the huge whispering VOICE OF THE NARRATOR . The organ has begun softly playing the melody of " Lonesome Valley " . p. 76 VOICE OF THE NARRATOR If education and understanding can not give us the answer to violence , then there can be no answer . But they do . And in this hour let Kentucky acknowledge her confusion and her shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow murky . The organ makes a discordant chord , a sort of anguished cry , and then resumes its melody . JOHN shakes his head and continues writing , his words coming through . When the governor of this state refuses to protect the helpless , refuses to defend the innocent , when the majesty of the law is invoked in vain by the citizens under it  --  when  --  Again the organ makes a discordant sound . JOHN 'S head sags forward on his arms . The light dims down on him . Far away the now outlandish VOICE OF THE NARRATOR is heard speaking across the void representing an authority impious and stubborn . Whereas certain teachers of the town of Berea are found to be a threat to the peace  --  and enemies to the State and dangerous to the security of our lives and our property , therefore I as governor do order and declare that these persons hereinafter named shall at once with their families depart the confines of the Commonwealth or failing that they shall be forcibly removed . Given under my hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the house in a long gray shaft of illumination . Walking into it and going toward the right rear and on out of sight is a line of men , women and children  --  the Berea refugees , carrying their bundles , some of the women with babies in their arms  --  a woebegone choreographed movement of homelessness and sorrow . The NARRATOR 'S VOICE comes in again , now sonorous and fervent , reciting the 37th Psalm  --  as the procession moves along . I have been young , and now am old , Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , Nor his seed begging bread.For the Lord loveth judgmentAnd forsaketh not his saints , They are preserved forever.But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.I have seen the wicked in great powerAnd spreading himself like a green bay tree.Yet he passed away , and lo , he was not.Yea , I sought him , but he could not be found.Mark the perfect man , and behold the upright , For the end of that man is peace . The procession moves on , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption which shakes JOHN out of his vision. p. 77 JOHN FREEMAN Crying out , as the organ stops . No ! No ! To give over  --  to let them drive you off  --  that 's not the way ! If everybody yielded then the truth would perish . He shakes his shoulders and leans his head over in his hands . The organ begins the weird music of " Jeff Davis 's Dream " . Three or four hooded figures appear on the right roadway and creep down toward the house . They move as if in time to the notes of the organ . Then one of them hurls a heavy stone with a message tied to it into the scene . There is the loud crash of breaking glass  --  as if the stone had gone through a window of the cabin . JOHN springs up and looks out . He stands listening , then turns slowly back into the room . The figures scuttle off back the way they came , accompanied in their exit by fleeting notes of the organ . JOHN gazes at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . ELIZABETH appears from her room at the left in her nightgown , her hair down . The organ stops . ELIZABETH What 's happened ? UNCLE EPH enters from the lean-to in his long nightshirt , carrying a gun . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Nightriders they was  --  I seed'em through the window . He comes forward , sees the rock and jumps back with a squeal.What 's that there on the floor ? DAVIE enters stripped to the waist. p. 78 JOHN FREEMAN To DAVIE . Some of your friends have paid us a call . DAVIE picks up the rock and unwraps the paper . DAVIE FREEMAN And left a message for you . You ca n't say I had a hand in it . I was in the room there . He looks at the message , then glances over at JOHN . Seems you 've got to quit your talkings and teachings or else . JOHN FREEMAN Else what ? DAVIE FREEMAN Read the warning . He hands him the paper . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS With a high moan . Oh Lordy mercy ! He turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden rage whirls and goes charging out of the room up the roadway . He shouts off . You low down rapscallions ! DAVIE FREEMAN Yelling . Come back here , you old fool ! UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Trying to scare good people to death , you devils ! Well , you ca n't run John Freeman and you ca n't me neither ! He fires his gun off through the night , then re-enters the room , chuckling grimly . ELIZABETH goes over to JOHN as the scene blacks out . The organ surges in with its reprise of " Lonesome Valley " for transition music , then dies . The light comes up on the left center stage. p. 79 Act 1 , Scene 7 ACT ONE : Scene VII The interior of the schoolhouse , at night some months later . The scene is lighted by a few lanterns here and there . SQUIRE SIMS is half-sitting on the table with a small stick of firewood in his hand for a gavel . JOHN is trying to speak to the group of angry citizens gathered about him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up Among those present in addition to the SQUIRE and JOHN are WILLIS , BROTHER ESAU , OTIS , TURNER , HENRY SIMS , ROBERTS , DONOVAN , SLOCUMB , MILLER , FARRIS , and DAVIE . Some of the men are seated , some standing . WILLIS is the challenging leader of the group and moves restlessly about the scene . VOICES Set down , John Freeman . We do n't want to hear you . We know how you stand . SIMS bangs on the table with his piece of wood . HENRY SIMS Let him speak . Gradually the noise subsides . JOHN FREEMAN You ca n't close my school . You ca n't rob these boys and girls of their chance at an education . Earnestly . I 've tried to help your children and I 'll go on helping them . You are my own folks , you know my heart . You know there 's no hate in it for anybody . I want us to live as friends , work together as friends . You have seen what killing and violence do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let us keep the peace . Is it wrong to teach that ? p. 80 JED WILLIS Let him answer the charges . JOHN FREEMAN Pleadingly to MILLER . Speak up , Mr. Miller . ISAAC MILLER Hesitatingly . Yeah , I reckon you 're right , John . Encouraged somewhat by his own words . I do n't  --  Folks , I do n't think you got a cause to close John 's school . JED WILLIS We 're gon na close it all right . JOHN FREEMAN Mr. Farris  --  GEORGE FARRIS Timidly . It looks like they 're all against you , John . JOHN turns appealingly to BROTHER ESAU . REVEREND ESAU MCKEE Seems you 've ' bout made a mess of things , John , and I 'm sorry to see it . OTHO TURNER I say let Brother Esau go back to teaching . JED WILLIS He ai n't got much learning , but he knows how to keep his mouth shut . And he 's on our side . FRANK OTIS I call for a vote , Squire . HENRY SIMS It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN FREEMAN I 've answered questions . I 've argued , I 've begged . You do n't listen . p. 81 VOICES I say down with John Freeman ! Drive him out ! HENRY SIMS Loudly . Order , order ! JOHN stares around at the hard faces , then sinks down onto a bench . Those sitting on the bench rise up and stand away as if fearing his contamination . The muttering of the men stops . Sims goes on . Let everybody be a witness . I ask you , did you give Murdock McGill a book ? JOHN FREEMAN For his little children . JED WILLIS Against the law of Kentucky . JOHN FREEMAN Surely a man has a right to teach his children to read . JED WILLIS Not when he 's a nigger . There is a fierce nodding of heads and growls of assent . HENRY SIMS You went to Governor Magoffin and urged that he send men with guns against the good people in Madison County . JOHN FREEMAN I asked him to help protect other citizens who were being illegally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him . HENRY SIMS And you 've been writing pieces in the paper asking the people to vote for Abraham Lincoln . p. 82 JED WILLIS A Black Republican ! JOHN FREEMAN A man is free to write and speak his own beliefs in this country . It 's our constitutional right . HENRY SIMS I 'm not talking about rights , I 'm talking about facts . You 've been teaching your scholars that slavery is wrong . JOHN FREEMAN How can it be right ? REVEREND ESAU MCKEE The Bible itself speaks up for slavery , " Slaves , obey your masters , " it says . We got you there , John . JOHN FREEMAN And our blessed Jesus said , " I come to set men free . " Human beings are not property to be bought and sold and can never be . HENRY SIMS Angrily . So when I say I own my slaves , then you say I am a liar and I do n't own ' em  --  do n't have any duty to protect ' em , to see after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you know that if the slaves were set free  --  four million black barbarians  --  they 'd swarm over this country murdering the white people ? VOICES Yeah , that they would . We 've heard enough . He 's a radical . SIMS pounds with his stick again. p. 83 HENRY SIMS Did you teach your students that the South has no right to take up arms against the North ? JOHN FREEMAN I 'm against either side taking up arms . HENRY SIMS We are asking you are you against the South ? JOHN FREEMAN The North is not our enemy . We are all one country . Springing up and turning to the men impassionedly . Let us all keep praying to Almighty God that this valley where we are neighbors can continue in peace . For it is written in the Holy Word that he who takes up the sword will perish by the sword . War never settles anything . It would only settle the lives of a lot of poor innocent boys , your boys , and some of you . The bugles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the young men go answering the call , helpless , blind , rushing in to kill one another . JED WILLIS We 're not afraid to fight . OTIS AND OTHERS That we 're not . JOHN FREEMAN And so you are set to turn this valley into a valley of blood , brother against brother  --  killing and burning and the rot of death over us . And let me tell you all of us will repent in sackcloth and ashes and grieving for our dead  --  we will repent . Our loved ones will perish , our homes be destroyed , and these precious slaves of yours be scattered and freed by force . And God 's laws will be avenged in our blood . He sits down again with bowed head. p. 84 OTHO TURNER Disgustedly . Lord , he loves to make them speeches ! HENRY SIMS Somewhat kindly . I believe in your heart you 're a good man . John . But your ideas are wrong . The rest of us are not enough like Jesus to live the way you want us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've met here to give you a chance . We know what the school means to you  --  JOHN FREEMAN Looking up , his voice almost a cry . Then do n't close it . HENRY SIMS We 're trying to give you a fair hearing . If you would take an oath to stay out of politics , to keep your mouth shut on these questions , we might let you go on teaching . I say we might  --  if you take an oath . JED WILLIS Loudly . No ! VOICES No , no . JOHN FREEMAN But how can I teach unless I teach what is right  --  what is true ? HENRY SIMS Sternly . I ask you , will you take an oath to abide by the ruling of this school board , or wo n't you ? JOHN FREEMAN How can I ? HENRY SIMS Springing down from the table and standing over JOHN . All right , I 'm finished with you . It 's your own neck you 're determined to break . I 've tried to stand by you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From now on I 'll stand with Jed Willis here . We 'll fight you , yes by soul , we 'll see that you stay quiet . You 're a traitor to your people , and we 're going to treat you like one , yes , if we have to we 'll drive you from Kentucky back to the Yankees where you belong . We 're gon na close the school . All in favor  --  JOHN springs up again. p. 85 JOHN FREEMAN This school building is on Mr. Miller 's land here . He owns it and if he says that it can stay open then it will . ISAAC MILLER Placatingly and yet timidly . I do n't see why he could n't continue teaching the little folks their A B C 's and reading , writing , and arithmetic . HENRY SIMS Loudly . All for closing the school say Aye . VOICES In loud chorus . Aye . JOHN and MILLER and FARRIS speak  --  JOHN loudly , MILLER less loudly , and FARRIS weakly . THE THREE No . HENRY SIMS The ayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his stick of wood . Meeting adjourned . The men move mumbling off , taking their lanterns as they go . FARRIS hesitates and then follows after them . Only DAVIE , MILLER and JOHN are left behind . ISAAC MILLER You better give in , John . They ai n't nothing we can do . They 're too strong for us . He starts away , then turns back . But if you want this school building , it 's yours . He goes out . DAVIE stands looking at JOHN. p. 86 DAVIE FREEMAN Quietly . Well , that 's the way it is , John . You can help me farm now . I need you . We 'll plant extra tobacco . JOHN FREEMAN Looking up at him . They can vote , but I wo n't quit . And I wo n't run away . I 'll go on teaching as long as I have one student . And then I 'll teach the empty benches . So help me , God ! DAVIE FREEMAN His irritation flaring out . Then you 're gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . JOHN is left alone , his head bowed in his hands . A moment he sits so , and then he gets down on his knees in anguished prayer . The scene blacks out . The organ comes in with its transition music from the next scene  --  " A Frog Went A-Courting "  --  and then dies . There is an instant of silence . Then from the darkness comes the shattering blast of an enormous trumpet . The light comes up on the forepart of the center stage. p. 87 Act 1 , Scene 8 ACT ONE : Scene VIII It is morning in the woods and UNCLE EPH and CHRIS SLOCUMB are on their way home again from ABNER DONOVAN 'S whiskey still . UNCLE EPH holds his jug in one hand and with the other is trying to assist SLOCUMB along who is drunker than he and filled with the determined spirit of celebration . SLOCUMB carries a long guano trumpet and a cow bell . CHRIS SLOCUMB Yelling and ringing his bell . Yay  --  ee !  --  Ee ! UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Shet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from UNCLE EPH , moves about the scene , slashing his bugle through the air and ringing his bell . UNCLE EPH wavers along after him , finally getting hold of him . I got to git you home to Mary and your seven younguns . CHRIS SLOCUMB Belching . Eight . We got a new one . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS And one more makes nine . I orter drown you . They move along toward the right . The light dims down on them somewhat . From the darkness over at the right front is heard the sound of children 's voices singing . The light comes up on the right side stage roadway , and JOHN and some five or six little tots are seen coming along down the mountainside on their way to school . JOHN is leading them in a gay song as they go , like a sort of Johnny Appleseed or Pied Piper marching in front . UNCLE EPH and SLOCUMB turn back a bit . The light brightens on them. p. 88 UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Calling across . You heard the big news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children squeal in fright and cluster behind JOHN for safety . He puts out a reassuring hand toward them as he stops and stares down across toward UNCLE EPH and SLOCUMB . Jed Willis brung it to Sim 's store . Old Abe Lincoln 's been elected president . The folks is wild . SLOCUMB rings his bell again . CHRIS SLOCUMB Wanter fight old Abe Lincoln ! UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Better take them children straight back home , John . Ai n't no telling what might happen . He turns SLOCUMB about and they move on up the roadway , the light dying from them . The children look at JOHN questioningly . He looks at them , smiles , then starts the song again . JOHN FREEMAN He rode till he came to Miss Mousie 's house &nbsp; &nbsp; Chow Willie , chow wee  --  The children join uncertainly in with the singing , and he leads them on as before . JOHN AND CHILDREN He rode till he came to Miss Mousie 's house , Saying open the door for me , Miss Mouse  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ree &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chow Willie wee . He and the children disappear into the shadows at the right , the song gradually dying in the distance as the light fades . The organ strikes the chords of the weird and modal piece , " Jeff Davis 's Dream , " and continues in a staccato , bassoon-like delivery . The light flares up on the center stage revealing the little schoolhouse . A number of hooded figures are inside the schoolhouse and two or three others outside ripping off the weather-boarding and wrecking the place . A fire has been started in the middle of the floor and pieces of wood and broken benches piled on it to feed the flames . JOHN 'S prideful and padlocked bookcase has been broken open and papers and books are also being thrown onto the fire . A yell is heard off at the right and JOHN rushes in. p. 89 JOHN FREEMAN Stop that ! Stop it ! He dashes into the schoolhouse to save his books . FIRST MARAUDER Warningly . Stand back , John Freeman . The children come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a horrified twittering huddle . JOHN seizes some of the books from the flames . JOHN FREEMAN You are burning the Holy Bible . FIRST MARAUDER Jerking the book from JOHN . Do n't reckon we want to do that . The MARAUDERS all speak in disguised voices . JOHN tries again to get at the burning books but is seized by several of them and pushed back . CHRIS SLOCUMB With a scream . They are hurting Mister John ! FIRST MARAUDER Get them children away from here . Two figures tear out of the schoolhouse and run across at the children , making . frightening gestures as they run . THE TWO MARAUDERS Woo-ah !  --  wooah ! The children terrified flee back the way they came . The TWO MARAUDERS return to the schoolhouse . JOHN is struggling in the hands of the men . More books are being brought forward. p. 90 SECOND MARAUDER I reckon these here books wo n't pizen nobody else . JOHN FREEMAN Gasping . You , you , my own neighbors . Staring at them . In olden times , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . FIRST MARAUDER Yeah , now us . The books are thrown into the fire . JOHN breaks loose , jumps forward and begins kicking the flames about . The men , seize him again . JOHN 'S hand shoots out and jerks away part of the FIRST MARAUDER 'S hood , revealing JED WILLIS . JOHN FREEMAN Jed Willis ! JED WILLIS And now we meet the way I 've wanted it to be . His voice hoarse with fury . All right , John Freeman . We warned you to stay away from this school , but you Would n't . Yelling . Drag him out ! The men pull JOHN through the door at the rear and into the woods , WILLIS prancing behind as if driven hysterical almost . He picks up the stout hickory stick as he goes . The organ crashes out its cry of anguish and continues . The sound of blows is heard in the darkness as JOHN is beaten . Shocked by what is happening , the light reacts to it , surging in , then out , then back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire inside the schoolhouse has been partly scattered in the struggle , and the books and pieces of wood send up more smoke than flame . The organ gives its final cry , then fades down to a low lamenting ululation. p. 91 JED WILLIS Off scene . I reckon that 'll teach him . OTHER VOICES He 'll behave now . Oh yes , he will . JED WILLIS Everything quiet now , no talking . VOICES No talking Not a word . The figures of the MARAUDERS are seen hurrying away and out at the left rear . The organ continues playing a moment . The light steadies . JOHN appears at the side of the schoolhouse , his clothes torn , his face and body bruised and bloody . He helps himself along with the stick , using it as a cane . He staggers on into the schoolhouse and manages to finish putting out the fire . He comes forward and sags down against one of the joists , clinging to it . He twists his shoulders in pain . ELSIE comes running in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children running and crying . She hurries over to JOHN and puts her arm around him . John , what have they done ? She stares at him in horror . They 've hurt you bad  --  bad ! JOHN FREEMAN Turning his face as if ashamed . Go away  --  you ca n't help me . ELSIE SIMS Oh  --  you 're bleeding ! She draws her hand away . It is red with blood . Her words break out wildly . You ought to get a gun and kill somebody  --  fight back  --  fight ! Her voice a mixture of scorn and pleading . Do n't cry ! p. 92 JOHN FREEMAN Shrilly . They were burning my books  --  I tried to save them . They dragged me off  --  beat me . Your brother Henry helped ' em do it . He shivers . God forgive me for the hate I felt  --  the darkness filling me . Take it from my heart . Striking his breast . I try to see my way . I pray for the light , the light . ELSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the light ! Staring at him . The shame of it , I say  --  the shame , that 's it . JOHN sinks down onto the steps . JOHN FREEMAN And it 's their shame , I tell you , not mine . Fiercely . Go ahead and pity me  --  He crawls to his feet . She tries to put her arms around him . ELSIE SIMS I do n't say it , John . With a wail as he pushes her off . Oh , I ca n't understand you . JOHN FREEMAN Staring at her , his eyes searching her face . If I took a gun and fought back , defended myself with a knife to death  --  you 'd understand me . Oh , yes , you would , and you 'd call me brave , you 'd look up to me , maybe , love me , even . Loudly . I do n't want such a love ! He staggers away leaning on his stick. p. 93 ELSIE SIMS Sorrowfully , accusingly as she follows him . It 's you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN FREEMAN I do . And I love you , Elsie . I tell you now when it 's all too late . ELSIE SIMS Running up to him again . Why do you say it is ? Why ? I 'll help you , John . I 'll stand by you . She reaches out to him . JOHN FREEMAN What good would it do for you to turn against your own people ? You 'd only suffer ! Suffer . No . I 've got to travel my way alone  --  ELSIE SIMS Blazingly . Hah ! JOHN FREEMAN  --  Travel this wilderness road by myself . ELSIE SIMS You ca n't keep on going against them . They 'll kill you . My own people will kill you ! JOHN FREEMAN You ca n't help me , I tell you . ELSIE SIMS O , you men  --  all of you  --  stubborn like God Almighty ! And we poor women beaten and driven between you . All we can do is love you and cry , love you and pour out our tears . Her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lean on me . She holds tightly to him , helping him along toward the left. p. 94 JOHN FREEMAN I 'll never give in to them . In God 's name  --  my flesh will be stronger than their steel . ELSIE SIMS Yes , John , you and your God . JOHN FREEMAN His face lifted , as if speaking to the Great Listener in the sky . I do n't hate them now . The darkness is gone  --  the bitterness wiped away . I forgive them . ELSIE SIMS And I forgive you , John . The light follows them as they go . NEILL comes running in at the left and assists ELSIE . NEILL SIMS I should a-been here . No matter what Pa threatened , I should a-been here . JOHN FREEMAN Stoping . Ignorance and hate  --  a dark cloud rising over the earth . Listen , Neill , listen ! Far away in the distance at the right the rainy sound of cheering is heard . Blind  --  blind ! Ignorant and blind ! They move on up the ramp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on us like hail out of the sky ! A curse , a curse I Blood . Blood ! The light fades out , and the sound of cheering dies away . The organ strikes up the military march with which the act opened , plays a few bars for the transition music , and then throttles itself down to a quivering , waiting intensity . In the distance a bugle blows the assembly call , high , soaring and commanding . The light comes up on the center stage. p. 95 Act 1 , Scene 9 ACT ONE : Scene IX The yard in front of the little schoolhouse , afternoon , sometime later . A bugle is heard blowing again , and then a great burst of cheering follows near at hand off at the right . The cheering grows louder and nearer and ENOCH CAMPBELL runs in at the right front waving a large and brilliant Kentucky flag from a long staff . ENOCH CAMPBELL The South has seceded ! The South has seceded ! He hurries on out at the left front waving the flag as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music again , and almost instantly the hills to the right and left are alive with the spirit of martial celebration . Cheering people begin running out on the side stage roadways , the light showing in splurges where they appear . JOHN , ELSIE and NEILL are seen on the left roadway . JOHN is leaning on his stick . Other people come in at the right and left rear . Lights and people vitalize the whole amphitheatre environment . The center stage is now rapidly filling with men and boys throwing up their hats and caps , and women and girls waving their scarves , bonnets and handkerchiefs . The organ continues to play and the young men and young girls swirl about in a frenzy of high feeling . The light grows steady on the center stage . JED WILLIS is seen standing on the steps of the little schoolhouse , and the people surge toward him . CAMPBELL has reentered and stands by him waving the flag. p. 96 JED WILLIS In a great voice as the music softens down . The South has declared her independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation is born  --  our nation ! PEOPLE Yea ! Yea ! JED WILLIS The Confederate States of America ! The bugle blows again and the organ makes a military salute of high notes , the ground bass rumbling beneath . VOICES War ! War ! OTHER VOICES Fight ! Fight ! JED WILLIS His long arms lifted . There will be no war ! The South has declared her independence . Kentucky Will soon join her . And no power on earth can drive us back into the union . It 's too late . The North wo n't fight . There 'll be no war ! Waving his big hat . Dixieland forever ! PEOPLE Hooray ! MILLER and FARRIS with their families appear in a small group at the right front . The light shows them there . Led by DAVIE and HENRY SIMS , the people rush angrily toward them , hissing and yelling at them as they run . The Yankee-lovers , the Yankee-lovers ! Drive ' em out ! MILLER and the others retire before their wrath . SIMS and JULIE MAE come down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ELSIE and NEILL to move on with them . NEILL stands away from his father . ELSIE pulls back , somewhat undecided . WILLIS shouts out again. p. 97 JED WILLIS Hooray for Dixieland ! PEOPLE Hooray ! The organ now changes from the military march into a sort of modal and half-discordant version of " Dixie . " The young people swirl about . ELSIE has moved a bit away from JOHN and NEILL and is looking toward DAVIE . He runs up to her and dances her down into the scene . NEILL goes after , then stops . WILLIS yells out loudly with the organ . JED WILLIS Dixie ! Dixie ! As if this were a signal , the organ smoothes itself out and gallops on into the song . The people begin singing . Led by WILLIS and CAMPBELL carrying the flag , they all start marching away at the right front . JOHN with the light still on him moves down from the left and stands by NEILL gazing after them . ELSIE and DAVIE are at the end of the procession near JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEILL stands looking after the people who are moving out at the right . JOHN puts his arm around him . The people continue their loud and triumphant singing as they march . As the song reaches a roaring finale on the word " Dixie , " the scene blacks out and the lights come on in the amphitheatre @x In the Kentucky hills , a summer afternoon in 1861 . At the blinking of the lights , the audience assembles back in the amphitheatre for act two . To begin the overture the organ makes a dynamic bugle call " To the Colors , " repeats it , then breaks into " Columbia , The Gem of the Ocean " played in powerful military style with rolling drum-corps effects and heavy bass plunging in . The lights go down and out , and while the organ continues , a series of rumbling explosions occurs far away as if deep under the earth , indicative of war and its senseless wrath . The whistle of a shell is heard passing directly over the audience through the night . Swirls of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage  --  the spotlight from the towers emphasizing them . The organ builds to a climax and dies . The NARRATOR enters rapidly at the left and addresses the audience in swift energetic words . The footlights illumine his figure . THE NARRATOR But the North did fight . War came . The long accumulated ill feeling and misunderstanding of the people were now to purge themselves out on the battlefields of blood and death , even as of old and from times immemorial . And in place of reason and love , which John Freeman and other men of good will believed in , once more madness and hate.In the bitter struggle Kentucky found herself hopelessly and tragically divided . And it was symbolic of this divisioning that the two leaders of the opposing sides  --  Abraham Lincoln for the North and Jefferson Davis for the South  --  were both sons of this same state , born within a year of each other and not many miles apart.1861  --  April 12  --  Fort Sumter had fallen to the secessionists , and the flag of the Union was hauled down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion . Now the sound of marching feet was heard in the land  --  the wild bugle of alarm , the rolling drum , cheers raised and tears shed as the young men of Kentucky and her hills rallied round the Stars and Stripes . The illumination dies from the NARRATOR , and The organ sounds its bugle call . The light comes up in a red diagonal stream from the left front to the right rear . The organ begins playing " The Battle Cry of Freedom , " and the unseen chorus starts singing in high jubilancy . Entering at the right rear comes a flag-bearer with the billowing Stars and Stripes held proudly aloft . He is followed by four or five soldiers , all dressed in blue Yankee uniforms . The chorus continues its singing . During the singing a number of young mountain men in their work clothes and carrying guns come down the roadway at the right . They are accompanied by a few of their relatives . We see them saying goodbye to their loved ones and hurrying on down into the scene to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MILLER and FARRIS families . Young GROVER MILLER embraces his sorrowing mother and strides pridefully away . The group of soldiers weaves its march across the stage , picking up more recruits . The chorus continues . We are springing to the call of our brothers gone before , &nbsp; &nbsp; Shouting the battle cry of freedom , And we 'll fill the vacant ranks with a million free men more , &nbsp; &nbsp; Shouting the battle cry of freedom . The soldiers and the proud recruits march diagonally out at the left rear as the song goes on . The grieving relatives and loved ones are now gathered at the right front looking in the direction the marchers have gone . The chorus builds to a climax and dies . The organ softens down , and the scene fades out . The light comes up on the NARRATOR again now over at the left . He speaks quickly as before. p. 99 THE NARRATOR And Jefferson Davis and the South answered back in armed defiance . And again there was the sound of marching feet in the land  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the young men of Kentucky rallied round the flag of the Confederacy  --  the Stars and Bars . Another red stream of light strikes across the scene from the right front and on across to the left rear . The organ repeats the bugle call , then begins playing " The Bonnie Blue Flag . " The unseen chorus starts singing in its high jubilancy . Entering from the left rear comes a flag-bearer holding the Confederate flag aloft , its silken folds glistening in the light . He too is followed by a few soldiers , all dressed in gray Confederate uniforms . Like the others they march straight ahead into the stream of light , their guns held stiffly , their faces set , moving puppet-like ahead . The chorus continues its singing . During the singing a number of young mountain men in their work clothes and carrying guns come down the roadway at the left . They also are accompanied by a few relatives , among them the SIMS and TURNER families . We see some of them saying goodbye to their loved ones  --  HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting the tearful little RUBY ROBINSON , and OTHO TURNER soberly giving his father a shy parting handshake and his mother an embrace . The young men hurry down into the scene and fall in behind the soldiers . The group weaves its march across the stage picking up more recruits . The chorus continues . As long as the old Union was faithful to her trustLike friends and like brothers kind were we and justBut now when Northern treachery attempts our rights to marWe hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star . The soldiers and gay recruits march diagonally off at the right rear , their relatives and loved ones at the left front gazing in the direction the marchers have gone . Some of them also are waving handkerchiefs and bonnets , and some are weeping . The chorus builds to a climax and dies . The organ stops , and the stream of light fades out . The light now holds in the separate areas  --  illuminating the two groups as they kneel in prayer . They lift their faces , speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pray the same prayer to the same God , SQUIRE SIMS at the left and ISAAC MILLER at the right leading as spokesmen. p. 100 SIMS , MILLER AND THE PEOPLE O Lord God  --  Our sons go forth to fight the good fight , For our cause is just.Give strength to ' their arms , O Lord , Protect and preserve them in the storm of battleAnd send them safely home again.Thou knowest our enemies beset us round about , The evil-doers gather to work us harm.Destroy them , O Lord , and vanquish them away ! And thine be the praise and the glory forevermore , We ask it all in the name of the blessed redeemer , Thy son Jesus Christ , Amen ! During the prayer JOHN comes along the rear from the left and stops in the background listening a moment . He is in working clothes and carries a jagged-toothed crosscut saw on his shoulder and a broadaxe in his hand . He looks queerly up at the sky an instant , then goes on off at the right . As the people finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeats the last bars of the two songs  --  " The Battlecry of Freedom " with the right hand and " The Bonnie Blue Flag " with the left  --  ending in a crashing discord . The light comes up on the NARRATOR now standing over at the left . THE NARRATOR In running words . And the holocaust of war began to burn with its frightful raging  --  in Virginia , Maryland and the Carolinas to the east  --  in Missouri , Arkansas and Texas to the west  --  and in Tennessee , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia and Florida to the south . In her dilemma Kentucky had on May 20 , 1861 , proclaimed her neutrality . But both sides viewed the commonwealth with greedy eyes . Without Kentucky , Lincoln said , western Virginia would be lost , and Maryland and Missouri , and maybe the war itself . So as John Freeman knew it would only be a matter of time before the two invaders would come racing in to win the state.And there in his mountain valley he still prayed and hoped the people might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for all that he had endured he stubbornly and patiently continued his plans and workings for the future  --  continued as best he could . The organ comes in with two or three chords of introduction to " Jeff Davis 's Dream " and softens down . From the darkness at the right comes the sound of energetic sawing and the voice of UNCLE EPH raised in a song . The light comes up on the right side stage. p. 101 p. 102 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO : Scene II The woods , an autumn afternoon some months later . UNCLE EPH is sawing on a board and singing as he works . JOHN is sawing on a beam in the shadows nearby , working swiftly away , his sleeves rolled up and his shirt wet with sweat . He lifts the newly-sawed board length and looks at it . John , how many thousand more of these dang boards I got to cut ? JOHN makes no answer but goes on sawing . Work  --  work like the world burning up . He do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Well , I hope and trust it ai n't all for nothing . He lays the board aside on a pile and sets his saw again . You got faith , boy . JOHN FREEMAN It takes faith  --  Continuing his work.  --  and elbow grease . SLOCUMB comes poking in from the left . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Thought you 'd gone off and j'ined the Confederate Army , Chris Slocumb . CHRIS SLOCUMB That doctor man put his head down on my chist and said my heart was plumb busted  --  could n't use me . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Yea , lying out all night and drinking hard liquor done it . p. 103 CHRIS SLOCUMB Rest , he said . Do n't work none neither , he said . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS What 'll happen to your eight children now ? CHRIS SLOCUMB Nanh  --  nanh  --  ten . We got twins . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Hah ! Disgustedly . Mebbe you 'll hafter quit that too . John goes off into the shadows . CHRIS SLOCUMB Gesturing . Folks are saying John Freeman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRIS SLOCUMB Him sawing and cutting here in the woods week after week , piling up timber and shingles . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS The nightriders finally burnt down his schoolhouse . Says he 's gon na be ready to build a new one when the war 's over . And I 'm a-helping him . JOHN re-enters with a square and begins measuring his beam for a fresh sawing . CHRIS SLOCUMB Well , I got to be moseying on and get to my bed . Shore hate I ca n't go out and fight . I was hoping to j'ine up with Jed Willis 's company like Davie and the other boys . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS And Davie 'll be sorry of it . We argued with him . Done no good . p. 104 CHRIS SLOCUMB Belching loudly . Lord , it 's pitiful to be so afflicted ! UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Drawing back his board . Git on from here , you dead-beat . CHRIS SLOCUMB Chuckling . Anyhow I ai n't crazy . He goes on up the side roadway at the right and into the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mops his face with his sleeve . ELSIE and her brother NEILL come rapidly in from the rear . ELSIE is upset . NEILL carries a gun in his hand . ELSIE SIMS I want you to talk to Neill , John . I 've begged him and begged him . Ma 's crying her eyes out . We ca n't do a thing with him . NEILL SIMS I 'm going off to fight for the Union , John Freeman , and I ask you to go with me . JOHN FREEMAN Sternly . Neill , you go back home and put up that gun . UNCLE EPH sits down on his work bench and fans himself . ELSIE SIMS He 'd be fighting against his own brother , Henry . NEILL SIMS Henry had no business taking the wrong side . Passionately to JOHN . You 've always talked how the country ought to be kept together . Then we ought to help . I ca n't stay out any longer . p. 105 JOHN FREEMAN Do n't do it , Neill . You 're young . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , his lips quivering . This thing will soon be over . I need your help here .

ELSIE SIMS Listen to him , Neill . NEILL SIMS I wo n't listen . Firmly . I ask you to go with me , John Freeman . DAVIE 'S voice is heard off at the left . DAVIE FREEMAN In marching time . One  --  two  --  three  --  four ! Hep ! Hep ! A small group of young fellows come marching in , DAVIE behind them . Some of them carry guns , and DAVIE wears a Confederate cap and holds his new uniform folded under his arm . The group consists of OTHO TURNER , JAKE ROSS , ENOCH CAMPBELL , JIMMY DONOVAN , and PAXTON BROWN . DAVIE sings out in boyish authority . Halt ! The group stops . DAVIE in a flourishing manner salutes ELSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate Army ! ELSIE SIMS Davie ! She is touched and saddened . NEILL stands tense and straight , looking at DAVIE. p. 106 JOHN FREEMAN With sudden roughness . So at last you 've decided to play the fool . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS You promised your ma you 'd wait , Davie . DAVIE FREEMAN I 've waited and waited while other fellows are . fighting for me  --  Charlie Merritt , Stuart Evans , Les Rowland . NEILL SIMS Loudly to JOHN . That 's it  --  you see ! DAVIE FREEMAN I 'm going to tell Ma goodbye now . You and John take care of things , Uncle Eph . There 's enough corn in the crib and meat in the smokehouse to last through the winter . We 'll have them Yankees whupped to a frazzle before spring . To ELSIE . And I 'll come by your house later , Elsie  --  all in my new uniform to tell you goodbye . He unrolls the uniform and holds up the tunic . Ai n't it purty ? I 'm going to put it on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . DAVIE FREEMAN I 'd break her heart if I kept playing  --  Bitingly.  --  the coward ! I 'm getting in this war , I tell you . JED WILLIS comes stepping along the roadway into the scene from the right . He is dressed in a Confederate captain 's uniform and carries a sword in his hand . DAVIE salutes. p. 107 DAVIE FREEMAN Detail ready , Captain Willis . JED WILLIS Saluting back . Good , good . Every man get two days ' provisions at home and meet me at the cross roads . We march by sundown . To NEILL who is over to one side , his back to WILLIS . We got room for you , son . See you 've already got your gun . Fall in . NEILL SIMS Turning around  --  hotly . I 'll not fight on your side  --  I 'll fight against you , Mr. Willis . JED WILLIS Oh-ho , Neill Sims  --  John Freeman 's bright scholar . Well , maybe we 'll meet on the battlefield , and I can split your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air by UNCLE EPH , who jumps out of the way with a howl . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Wrathfully . You plumb nigh cut me with that there thing , Jed Willis ! JED WILLIS Just giving you a little sample  --  Bowing . Miss Elsie Sims and Jesus the carpenter ! To JOHN . That 's right , work hard , get plenty of lumber ready while we 're gone . We 'll use it to put up our school when we get back  --  our school , I say , not yours . p. 108 JOHN FREEMAN Harshly . We 'll see whose school . JED WILLIS And it wo n't be long . We 're beating them Yankees everywhere . And when we get back we 'll attend to you , John Freeman  --  if you 're still here . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS You ai n't run him yit and never will . JOHN FREEMAN The South wo n't win this war , Jed Willis . She 's got no navy and no factories , no steel plants , no ships  --  nothing but slaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN FREEMAN And twenty million free men against you , fighting for a better cause . And General Don Carlos Buell is building an army of fifty thousand men beyond the Ohio to march in here and take this state . JED WILLIS And General Braxton Bragg is forming an army below the Tennessee to see he do n't . That 's the army we are joining . And when we march back into Kentucky  --  He flourishes his sword . JOHN FREEMAN The South is wrong  --  and the wrong will never win . WILLIS laughs and cuts his sword in the air again . JED WILLIS Sardonically . Ai n't no right or wrong in a war  --  too late for that . All right , men . The group straightens up. p. 109 DAVIE FREEMAN Calling gaily to ELSIE . By to see you later , Elsie . And you pin a red rose on my coat for good luck  --  all with your purty two hands . Turning to JOHN . Goodbye , John . The two brothers look at each other , JOHN takes DAVIE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you 're doing is wrong , but I 'll pray for you , Davie . DAVIE FREEMAN Laconically . Yeh , you do the praying and I 'll do the fighting . JOHN turns to the four boys and deeply moved bids them farewell . He embraces them . They are embarrassed at his show of emotion . JOHN FREEMAN God bless you  --  and bring you back safe . BOYS Mumbling . Goodbye , Mr. John . DAVIE FREEMAN ' Tenshun ! WILLIS points with his sword back the way he came . JED WILLIS Forward  --  march ! He leads the way out to the right , cutting his blade through the air again as he passes the wrathful UNCLE EPH . The four boys shoulder their guns and move off , DAVIE following behind them. p. 110 DAVIE FREEMAN Counting as they march . One  --  two  --  three  --  four . Hep , hep . ELSIE takes a few steps after DAVIE . As he looks back she lifts her hand in a little wavering gesture . JOHN stares at her and then turns to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIS . Give some folks a uniform and it just runs ' em crazy ! NEILL SIMS Angrily to JOHN . You speak of the thousands that 'll come in here to save the state and save us . But if they 're all like  --  like you  --  there would n't be those thousands . They 'd never come . ELSIE SIMS Neill ! NEILL SIMS I do n't want others to die for me so I can save my precious skin . To JOHN . Here you are working and sweating , getting ready for your school  --  our school , the one we 've talked about and planned for . Do n't you see that if Jed Willis and his side win you 'd never have the school . We 'd never have it . There 'd be no freedom and equality you believe in . The nation would be broke in two and slavery established forever . All right then , I 'll fight for the school . JOHN FREEMAN Grabbing his arm as he starts away . Then do it by staying here and helping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . p. 111 ELSIE SIMS He 's right , Neill , he is ! NEILL SIMS If a man believes in a thing , then he ought to be willing to fight for it  --  to spill his blood for it . JOHN FREEMAN Blood , blood  --  yes . And soon they 'll be bringing home the wounded and the dying , Neill , and we will help heal their wounds , help them in their suffering . We 've still got to have patience , Neill . Stay here . NEILL SIMS Patience , patience ! Crying out . It must be like folks say  --  you 're afraid to fight  --  Fiercely.  --  a coward . ELSIE SIMS Neill ! NEILL turns sharply away , and JOHN takes him sternly by the arm and jerks him back . JOHN FREEMAN It 's an easy thing to take up a gun . It 's harder , Neill , to work , to be patient , to endure . Peace wo n't Come through violence , love wo n't come through hate . Loudly . Thou shalt not kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of my father . NEILL springs away with his gun . NEILL SIMS I ca n't believe you . I ca n't believe anything you say any more ! He turns and dashes back the way he came . ELSIE reaches out to him , but he sidesteps her and disappears . She turns forlornly back to JOHN. p. 112 ELSIE SIMS I 'm sorry he said  --  that word . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS John ai n't no coward . If he had a-been , he 'd a-high-tailed it away from here long time ago , seeing what they done to him . He sets his board for sawing again . Still , I understand how Neill and Davie feels . JOHN starts sawing his beam fiercely . ELSIE steps over to him . His saw stops . He looks up at her with haggard face . ELSIE SIMS And I 'm trying to understand you , john . She kisses him suddenly on the cheek , then hurries away into the shadows . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Chuckling . I reckon she 'll keep sticking by you . Mopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will too . You 're a good preacher with words , john . Out of my soul 's lost condition I say so . Ahm . But if preaching would save the world . I 'd already be sanctified . JOHN starts to work again , and UNCLE EPH doggedly raises his song as he resumes sawing . He dreamt that the devil stood close by his bedWith his mouth breathing smoke and his eyes burning redAnd he had a hemp rope for to put round his head , Saying , come along , traitor , with me . The scene blacks out and the organ makes a short reprise of the melody into transition music . The light comes up showing the NARRATOR standing over at the left as before. p. 113 THE NARRATOR Devouring war took its fearful wages of death . And the boys from the valley died on distant battlefields  --  Jimmy Donovan and Enoch Campbell on Shiloh 's dark and bloody ground  --  Lester Grigsby on the Potomac peninsula  --  Shad Roberts at Malvern Hill  --  Milton Dunn at fearful Antietam . And as john @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now returning . The light dims down on the NARRATOR as he turns and looks toward the right center stage . The light comes up there revealing the figure of a wounded Confederate soldier coming painfully along . His arm is in a sling and he walks waveringly with a stick . He turns to help a second soldier behind him who is struggling along on crutches . The organ has begun the song " What Is the Soul of Man ? " and the chorus off-scene begins singing in a great hushed harmony of half-distinct words . JOHN FREEMAN comes hurrying in from the left , puts himself between the two wounded men and with his arms around them , helps them along . He passes them on to the kind reaching hands of a few neighbors who have entered . Then he turns and meets a number of other wandering wounded ones coming in  --  a blinded Confederate soldier , making his way along leaning on his stick and behind him another one with an arm gone , another with a missing leg , hopping on a crutch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the left rear and assist the crippled soldiers . JOHN turns back into the shadows at the right front . From the chorus comes the sound of women 's voices weeping and wailing above the song . The little procession moves on toward the left . The NARRATOR with the light dimmed down on him gazes sympathetically at the scene , and the chorus carries on its mourning song . You know what the moon and the stars may be , The width of the salt-sea lan'But where is the tongue that can answer me this  --  What is the soul of man ? JOHN re-enters from the right carrying the broken light form of PAXTON BROWN in his arms . Little DORA runs in from the left . She stuffs her fist against her mouth in horror as she sees her brother . She walks beside him , holding his hand , as JOHN carries him on . The singing softens down into a rich wordless harmony . The light brightens on the NARRATOR and dies from the center stage. p. 114 THE NARRATOR As the singing fades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the people . And in many a cabin home at night the sound of weeping was heard as mothers , sisters , sweethearts , sorrowed for their loved ones . Far away and in different directions from the darkness comes the sound of women sobbing . And in their common suffering they turned one to another , and antagonisms were buried for awhile  --  even as they buried their dead . The sound of the sobbing fades out . The light dies from the NARRATOR and comes up on the center stage at the back . The organ begins softly playing the " Lonesome Valley " melody. p. 115 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT TWO : Scene III At the mountain cemetery near the church , an afternoon in summer some months later . The valley people are gathering up in the burial ground at the rear , coming in from the right and left and going up the rocky mountain side to where the burial service is about to take place . Some of the women are dressed in mourning and some are weeping silently . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps off . They all begin singing along with the unseen chorus . The people are so arranging themselves at the rear now that the actual business of the burial  --  the coffins and the graves  --  is obscured from our sight . A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER enters with the Stars and Bars at the right and takes his place up at the left . A FEDERAL SOLDIER with the Stars and Stripes enters from the left and takes his place opposite over at the right . We recognize most of the people we have seen before  --  the SIMS family , the MILLER family , the FARRIS and TURNER families , BROTHER ESAU MCKEE who is now getting old and feeble and is leaning on his stick , and others . JOHN is standing on a little rise above the people and is holding an open Bible in his hand . He is in charge of the short funeral service . The singing stops . JOHN FREEMAN Reading . O Lord thou art my God , Thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.And he will destroy in this mountainThe face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil that is spread over all nations.He will swallow up death in victory.And the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.And the rebuke of his peopleShall he take away from off the earth.For the Lord hath spoken it . We see the two figures of ADA TURNER and LILY MILLER dressed in mourning , standing side by side . They are sobbing unashamedly . JOHN closes his Bible and lifts his face . The people now bow their heads and recite with him. p. 116 JOHN AND THE PEOPLE Lord , thou hast been our refugeFrom one generation to anotherBefore the mountains were brought forthOr ever the earth and the world were made JOHN FREEMAN Alone . Thou hast set our misdeeds before theeAnd our secret sins in the light of thy countenance . O teach us to number our daysThat we may apply our hearts unto wisdom . THE PEOPLE Teach us , O Lord . JOHN FREEMAN And now into the earth we commit the bodies of these two boys  --  Otho Turner and Grover Miller , dead of wounds in battle  --  and reconciled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending down now lowering the unseen coffins into the grave , and the two great colorful flags are held out and over in drooping benediction . ADA TURNER With a wail . My boy ! My boy ! LILY MILLER Likewise . My boy ! My boy ! JOHN holds out his hand and pantomimes letting dirt fall on the coffin . ADA and LILY put an arm around each other . JOHN FREEMAN Earth to earth , dust to dust . The chorus begins singing again , and the people join in. p. 117 PEOPLE AND CHORUS Piteously . I must walk this lonesome valley , &nbsp; &nbsp; I must walk it by myself.Oh , nobody else can walk it for me , &nbsp; &nbsp; I must walk it by myself . From the moving heads and shoulders of the neighbor men we see that they are busy filling up the graves . The organ resumes its soft playing . The two soldiers march off to the right and left front . JOHN steps down and leads the people away at the right rear . The light starts fading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , &nbsp; &nbsp; You must walk it by yourself.Nobody else can walk it for you , &nbsp; &nbsp; You 've got to walk it by yourself . They all disappear into the shadows . The organ reprises the melody and the light brightens on the NARRATOR at the left . THE NARRATOR Swiftly , energetically , as the organ dies . Invasion had come to Kentucky . The opposing forces pouring in from the north and from the south . At first raiding and skirmishing  --  feeling each other out  --  preparing for the final struggle . The surprise , the attack by night , the terror of the assassin 's bullet , the flaming torch , houses burnt , innocent people driven away , citizens hanged ! The woes and afflictions of the people in the valley increased , and from burying their dead they assembled at the little meeting house praying with one voice  --  praying to Almighty God that he would send peace . The light fades from the NARRATOR and comes up on the center stage. p. 118 p. 119 Act 2 , Scene 4 ACT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning sometime later . The mountain people are gathered in and around the little building , most of them kneeling in excited and fervent supplication . JOHN is standing in their midst , leading the prayer . JOHN FREEMAN O Lord , our hands are lifted to thee ! Our bitter tears fall from our eyes . We have wandered in darkness and confusion . Help us keep our feet in the true path the way that leads through this wilderness of pain and tribulation . PEOPLE Loudly . Grant it , Lord . JOHN FREEMAN Let thy light guide us . For now the innocent suffer , the weak and the helpless are trodden down . They cry to thee . PEOPLE Help us , Lord . JOHN FREEMAN Yea , now the earth is red with the blood of thy children . Show us the way . PEOPLE Show us the way . JOHN FREEMAN All thy people cry for peace ! PEOPLE Peace , O Lord ! Send peace ! JOHN FREEMAN Spare us , Almighty God ! PEOPLE In a great cry . Spare us ! Spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , then other shots , followed by a burst of yelling . The people in front of the church jump fearfully up and look around . Some half dozen Yankee soldiers tear across the scene . They have hardly disappeared before a like number of Confederate soldiers rush in after them . People begin pouring out of the church . A bugle blows wildly off at the right . Then more yells and brisk rifle and musket fire are heard . The light fades from the church and comes up on the forepart of the center stage . The people come crowding down from the shadows at the back , JOHN in front. p. 120 UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Squealing and pointing off . Get away  --  we 'll all be killed ! They 're a-fighting . JED WILLIS comes in hurriedly at the left , his sword in his hand . His once-shining uniform is now stained and dirty . JED WILLIS To JOHN . Get these people away from here . Scatter  --  I order all of you  --  at once ! JOHN FREEMAN This is a prayer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here ! Some of the people begin moving away . JOHN cries out . JOHN FREEMAN Do n't be afraid . WILLIS sets off running across the right and out . Again rifle fire in the distance . The people mumble , some of the women moan and cling to each other . ELSIE is standing near JOHN . LILY MILLER screams out . LILY MILLER Stop the killing ! Merciful Jesus ! Stop it , stop it ! VOICES O lord , have mercy upon us ! Mercy , Lord , Mercy ! A number of the people fall on their knees , bowing their heads up and down . An emotional fervor seizes them , and they cry out their pleading. p. 121 PEOPLE Ad lib . Forgive us our sins ! Thou hast cursed us , O God . Thy wrath consumes us ! Save us , Almighty , God , save thy people ! A few of the women are heard reciting the Lord 's Prayer in the turmoil . WOMEN Our father , who art in heaven  --  hallowed be thy name  --  thy kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt down , his huge arms flailing about , his voice breaking in great shouts . REVEREND ESAU MCKEE O Lord god ! Hear us , God !  --  hear us , hear us ! PEOPLE Wildly . Hear us ! JOHN moves among the hysterical people , trying to comfort them . A few loud thunderings of cannon are heard in the distance , and then the sounds of battle begin to die . NEILL SIMS staggers in at the right , dragging his gun and gasping for breath . His right leg has been shattered . NEILL SIMS With a moan . Help me ! JULIE MAE and ELSIE hear his voice and run toward him . JULIE MAE SIMS Neill ! NEILL collapses on the ground , and JULIE MAE and ELSIE bend over him . SIMS and JOHN hurry over , and others crowd back into the scene . JOHN kneels down by him. p. 122 NEILL SIMS With a cry . Not you , John freeman . Get away ! Get away ! He tries to push JOHN 'S hand angrily off . Help me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . And John will help you too . JOHN FREEMAN Lift him up . They start helping NEILL off toward the left . At this moment DAVIE and two Confederate soldiers , JAKE ROSS and LES ROWLAND , come running in . Davie is now a lieutenant , and his once proud uniform is begrimed and smoke-burned . DAVIE FREEMAN He 's my prisoner . Recognizing NEILL . Lord , it 's Neill Sims ! JOHN FREEMAN We got to get him to a doctor . PEOPLE Ad lib. , excitedly . It 's Davie ! Davie freeman ! He 's our friend . He wo n't hurt us . DAVIE FREEMAN Shouting . Get on back to your homes-everybody ! ELIZABETH FREEMAN runs up and embraces DAVIE . She clings to him . He kisses her and pats her shoulder . That 's all right , Ma , we ai n't gon na hurt anybody . ELIZABETH Davie ! Davie ! Oh , you 've come back safe and sound . p. 123 DAVIE FREEMAN Yeh , they ai n't a bullet fast enough to ketch me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moves about excitedly . DAVIE FREEMAN Yelling at the people in a sort of brutal gaiety . You heard my orders ! You  --  Uncle Eph ! Scat , every one of you ! UNCLE EPH looks at him in hurt incredulity , then turns and moves toward the left with the others . DAVIE grins at JOHN . Well , John , we 're back  --  the way we said  --  and Kentucky is ours ! He drops his arm from around his mother , moves over to ELSIE , takes her hand and kisses it . Sweet Elsie , waiting like you promised ? A little longer and I 'll be back with , you for good . Yes . She smiles at him , a sad but pleased smile . WILLIS enters hurriedly at right . JED WILLIS To the people . Move on ! Move on ! To DAVIE . We 're ordered to fortify the bridge down there and put a guard around it . He gestures off toward the left rear . DAVIE FREEMAN Saluting . Yes sir . We 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em yonder in the woods . See after him  --  then meet me at the bridge . DAVIE FREEMAN Yessir . JED WILLIS Gazing hard at JOHN an instant . Well , where are your thousands now , John Freeman  --  coming to save Kentucky for you ? Better do like old Isaac Miller  --  clear out of this country . JOHN looks at him , saying nothing , standing there with his Bible in his hand . Still depending on that Bible , I see . He breaks into a laugh , then hurries toward the right . He malevolently cuts his sword at UNCLE EPH as he goes . The old man lets out a squeal of anger and fear . WILLIS laughs again and is gone , JAKE ROSS with him . The rest of the people move on . DAVIE and LES form a saddle of their clasped hands , and lifting NEILL on it , bear him away at the left , his helpless arms clinging about their necks  --  ELSIE , JULIE MAE , SIMS , and ELIZABETH following . JULIE MAE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right a bugle blows the assembly call . The scene is now empty except for JOHN . UNCLE EPH tears back in . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Beggingly . Come on , John , come on  --  we got to git away from here . Frantically . Come on , I tell ye , come on ! He runs back the way he came . JOHN turns toward the rear , sees NEILL 'S gun which has fallen to one side , picks it up and holds it in one hand and the Bible in the other . Far away in the distance the sound of cannon fire is heard again , and then silence . JOHN stands looking at the gun and at the Bible as if weighing the meaning of one against the other . A moment he stares so and then turns slowly back into the shadows at the rear . The scene fades out , the light brightens on the NARRATOR at the left. p. 125 THE NARRATOR As before . The Confederate forces thus overran the Kentucky hills from the east and from the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle of Richmond , August 30 , 1862 , Bragg 's southern forces under General Kirby Smith defeated General Buell 's Union army . September 2 , Lexington was captured , Bowling Green was occupied , and everywhere it seemed the Union cause was failing and all that John Freeman had believed in would be lost . And there aloft in the hills he agonized in the dark hours of the night  --  praying to God to give him guidance , to help him see the way forward on the long wilderness road  --  asking God to deliver him from the body of this death . The light fades from the NARRATOR and comes up at the left rear p. 126 Act 2 , Scene 5 ACT TWO : Scene V A high eminence in the hills , same as scene one of act one , night , some hours later . JOHN is sitting on a boulder bowed over , still holding the Bible and the gun . He is in a turmoiling crisis of decision . He twists his shoulders and lifts his face supplicatingly toward the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The NARRATOR 'S VOICE continues from the darkness . THE NARRATOR And from the air voices speaking their condemnation at him  --  ELSIE SIMS In the sound track , repeating like a phonograph record . I do n't understand you , John  --  I do n't understand you  --  never understand  --  understand  --  understand you  --  NEILL SIMS In the sound track likewise , high and strident . If a thing is right  --  if a thing is right  --  fight for it  --  fight for it  --  SIMS ' VOICE I 'm done with you , John Freeman ! MEN 'S VOICES Down with John Freeman  --  drive him out . NEILL SIMS I 'll fight for the school  --  you wo n't fight ! The school ! The school ! The school ! p. 127 VOICES In sequence . Coward , coward , coward ! The voices diminish and die mockingly in the distance . JOHN FREEMAN Calling across the night . Father  --  Father  --  THE NARRATOR And out of the past the voice of his father Luke Freeman answering him in his pleading , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , holding in a shimmering tremolo . JOHN jerks his head up as if listening . Then from the void the benign yet affirmative voice of LUKE FREEMAN , the mountain preacher , is heard in the sound track . LUKE FREEMAN 'S VOICE Skin for skin , yea all that a man hath will he give for his life . JOHN FREEMAN Shuddering . No ! No , Father . LUKE FREEMAN 'S VOICE Verily except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone  --  JOHN FREEMAN Abideth alone . LUKE FREEMAN 'S VOICE But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit . JOHN FREEMAN Yes . LUKE FREEMAN 'S VOICE First the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear . p. 128 JOHN FREEMAN Yes , yes . LUKE FREEMAN 'S VOICE He that loveth his life shall lose it . JOHN FREEMAN Shall lose it . LUKE FREEMAN 'S VOICE And he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal  --  JOHN FREEMAN Falling on his knees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant . Unto life eternal . Yes  --  yes  --  yes ! The organ makes a comment with its shimmering interpretation , and the scene fades out . The organ returns to its normal harmony , and then suddenly wails out a painful cry and is silent . From the darkness at the left front NEILL 'S voice is heard , wild and demented . NEILL SIMS Screaming . Oh  --  oh  --  oh ! DR . JOE MERRITT Roughly . Hold him ! Hold him ! NEILL SIMS Stop it ! Stop it ! DR . JOE MERRITT It 's almost off now !

He 's holding yo ' hand . p. 129 JULIE MAE SIMS Help my boy , Lord , help him ! ANNABELLE SIMS Merciful Jesus ! Jesus ! The organ gives another burst of lamenting chords and stops . The light comes up suddenly on the left side stage. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene VI Interior of the SIMS home as before , night a short time later . A bed is at the back on which NEILL is lying . DOCTOR JOE MERRITT , a rough and ready man of sixty , has just finished amputating NEILL 'S leg and cauterizing the wound . We see the figure of the doctor disappearing at the rear bearing an object wrapped in a cloth . He returns immediately and stands by NEILL , holding his wrist . Gathered in the scene are SIMS , JULIE MAE , ANNABELLE , ELSIE , DAVIE , EXOM and his wife DEBBIE . Old DEBBIE is fanning NEILL 'S ghastly face with a palmleaf fan . Old EXOM is down on the floor by the bed wringing his hands in prayer . The women are weeping , their backs to the scene . ELSIE has her arms around her mother . DAVIE is standing by the bed with his coat off , his sleeves rolled up . He has been helping the doctor . SIMS is sunk in an armchair . A Confederate soldier , LES ROWLAND , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt of his gun resting on the floor . DAVIE FREEMAN Rolling down his sleeves . It 's all right now , Neill . DR .

EXOM rises and goes out after him . NEILL SIMS Gasping . Water , water ! SIMS lifts a dipper of water from a bucket on the table and holds it to his lips . NEILL tries to drink , but the water runs out of his mouth . SIMS lays his head back , bends over and kisses him. p. 132 HENRY SIMS A good boy , Neill . You stood it mighty well , son . JULIE MAE , Elsie and ANNABELLE now turn and go up closer to the bed . NEILL SIMS With a sudden cry . They cut my leg off ! JULIE MAE SIMS Caressing his hand . They had to cut it off , son .

JOHN is seen slowly coming up to the house from the right . He still carries the gun and the Bible . He enters the room at the right front , and they all turn toward him . ELSIE SIMS He 's asking for you . JOHN FREEMAN Abstractedly . I brought his gun back . DAVIE FREEMAN He wo n't need it now . He 's done fighting . NEILL SIMS Weaving his head about and letting out a high call . Books , book 's , come in to books ! ANNABELLE SIMS Lord a-mercy , he 's out'n his head again . HENRY SIMS To JOHN .

He strokes NEILL 'S forehead . NEILL grabs his hand. p. 134 NEILL SIMS Feverishly . You promise  --  you promise ? JOHN FREEMAN I promise . NEILL drops his hand , his eyes closing . HENRY SIMS I 'm glad you come , John . It helps him . JOHN FREEMAN You sleep , Neill . Sleep and rest , boy . Sleep . He turns half-blindly away , picks up the Bible and gun , and comes forward to the front of the scene . Old DEBBIE keeps her fan going above NEILL 'S ashen face . JULIE MAE SIMS Thanky , John , for coming . She leans over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank Neill . ELSIE looks at him . He turns and comes out of the house . DAVIE follows after him , ELSIE also . The light begins to dim on the sickroom . JOHN turns around . DAVIE and . ELSIE look at him . Neill 's the only thing that matters now . DAVIE FREEMAN Doctor Joe says he 'll pull through . He 's young and strong . JOHN FREEMAN Yes , Neill must live . Shaking his head . And you go by to see Mother , Davie. p. 135 DAVIE FREEMAN I will . I 'm ordered to guard the bridge down there . He gestures . JOHN FREEMAN Yeh , the bridge  --  Sticking out his hand . Tell her goodbye for me . ELSIE comes up . JOHN turns to her . You keep this Bible , Elsie . DAVIE FREEMAN Goodbye ? JOHN hands ELSIE the Bible . She gazes at him queryingly and takes it . JOHN stands holding the gun in both his hands . What is it , John ? JOHN FREEMAN And , Davie , you take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsie , you look after Davie . DAVIE FREEMAN Where you going ? JOHN FREEMAN Nodding to the left . I 'm going to fill Neill 's place . DAVIE FREEMAN What ? JOHN FREEMAN Neill must have his school  --  our school . I  --  His voice dies out . DAVIE grasps JOHN 'S hand and gazes into his face . The two brothers embrace each other . DAVIE FREEMAN With tears in his eyes . You 're gon na fight . p. 136 JOHN FREEMAN For him  --  fight for Neill . I must try  --  must help  --  Again his voice dies away . He gestures back toward the scene at the left which has now faded out . ELSIE SIMS John ! JOHN FREEMAN Goodbye . He takes her hand , puts it in DAVIE 'S , gives them both a smile , then turns and walks away into the darkness of the center stage , carrying the gun at the ready before him as he goes . ELSIE SIMS WeepingSeemed like he was saying goodbye  --  forever . Calling . John ! DAVIE FREEMAN Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor face . She bows her head . DAVIE FREEMAN Yes , death . Gazing at her . He said for me to take care of you  --  She looks up at him with streaming eyes . And you me . He puts his arm protectingly around her and they turn back toward the house . The scene fades slowly out . There is an instant of silence and then from the darkness of the center stage the sudden burst of a merry accordion is heard playing " Goober Peas . " The light flares up full there. p. 137 Act 2 , Scene 7 ACT TWO : Scene VII A Federal encampment . A group of soldiers and girls are carrying on a sort of free-for-all dance . Liquor has been flowing and everybody is feeling good . A fellow over at the right is playing furiously on his accordion , and the couples are bounding back and forth across the scene in a joyous galop . At the rear are the outlines of a few tents , and above them the Stars and Stripes is flying from a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear . The dance is led by a SERGEANT , a heavy-set slouch of a man with a huge mustache , and by a spry-legged young CORPORAL . The girls are laughing and tra-la-ing as they go , and the soldiers are whooping it up . Off-scene a male quartet is singing to their dancing . The dancers join in the singing , carrying on their turning and charging back and forth . With their free hands they pantomime eating the peas , dancing all the while . QUARTET Off-scene as before . Just before the battle the general hears a row , He says " The Yanks are coming , I hear their rifles now . " He turns around in wonder , and what do you think he sees  --  The Michigan militia eating goober peas . QUARTET , SOLDIERS AND GIRLS Peas , peas , peas , peas , eating goober peas , Goodness how delicious , eating goober peas ! The music goes on , and the dancers turn their girls about , still pantomiming the eating of goober peas . The SENTRY up at the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JOHN enters at the rear with his gun , a lonely bareheaded figure . The SENTRY comes down to meet him . The dancing and singing have instantly stopped and everybody turns to look at the newcomer . JOHN 'S movements are abstracted and preoccupied , almost as if he were in the grip of some inner numbing and wordless pain . He hands a message to the SENTRY who looks at it and then in derision announces him . John Freeman , a recruit ! A YANKEE SERGEANT Mockingly . Recruit , recruit ! A YANKEE CORPORAL Also mockingly . A goober farmer . GIRLS Squealing . A goober farmer , a goober farmer ! The accordion strikes up again and in a spirit of fun and devilment they all prance around . JOHN . The SERGEANT grabs up his bayonetted gun nearby and drunkenly makes at him . A YANKEE SERGEANT On guard ! The CORPORAL in the same spirit jerks JOHN 'S gun from him , and he and the SERGEANT pantomime a bayonet attack . on JOHN . SERGEANT AND CORPORAL Jab , stick , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers and girls bend about with laughter . One of the girls picks up a Yankee coat and flings it over JOHN 'S shoulders . Another one unties her bonnet and puts it on his head . JOHN stands looking at them with stricken hurt face , suffering his pathetic and Christ-like martyrdom , as they jeer at him . Suddenly a number of them fall on their knees around him , stretching out their hands as they sing in drunken pleading. p. 139 SOLDIERS AND GIRLS Peas , peas , peas , peas , give us goober peasOh my Lord ha ' mercy , give us goober peas . JOHN FREEMAN You girls are drunk ! A YANKEE SERGEANT Wagging his head . Eat , drink and be happy . A YANKEE CORPORAL For tomorrow may never come . He flings his arms about the legs of a girl who is standing by him , and rubs his cheek against her knees . Several of the girls get JOHN by the hands and turn him about . The quartet off-scene starts up its amplified singing again , and the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild circle , with JOHN turning queerly around in the center . QUARTET , SOLDIERS AND GIRLS I think my song has lasted almost long enough , Subject 's interesting but rhymes are mighty rough.I wish the war was over when free from rags and freeze , We kiss our wives and sweethearts and gobble goober peas . The soldiers kiss the girls and hug them . QUARTET Peas , peas , peas , peas QUARTET , SOLDIERS AND GIRLS  --  give us goober peas , Never mind the fighting  --  give us goober peas . The air is split with a loud bugle blowing the call to quarters . The dancers hesitate a moment , gesture dismissingly , and continue their fun . The bugle blows again . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK comes into the scene from the right front. p. 140 LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK Break it up ! Break it up ! Lights out ! The dance regretfully stops . The soldiers and girls begin to move toward the rear , saying tender farewells . You girls  --  off with you ! The girls go away into the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tents at the rear . BLACK stares at JOHN . What ungodly specimen is this ! JOHN abstractedly lifts the bonnet from his head and stands holding it in his hand . A girl re-enters , snatches it and speeds away . GUARD Satirically . He 's got a message from the Colonel . BLACK reaches out and takes a paper from JOHN 'S hand . He looks at it . The SERGEANT comes back and gets his coat from JOHN . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK To JOHN . I 'll take you to Major Maxton . You men get your sleep . JOHN picks up his gun and follows him out at the right front . The accordion player reprises the " Goober Peas " song as he sits on a box at the rear , then changes into the slow and mournful melody of " Just Before the Battle , Mother . " The SENTRY goes back to his post . The men at the rear now are preparing to take their rest  --  some unlacing their shoes , some laying themselves back on the ground , others pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleepily . The scene is fading out , the misty radiance of the starlit night coming restfully and dreamfully down over the recumbent soldiers . The SENTRY remains illuminated there at his post at the left rear . He leans over his gun , staring off . The song continues . The scene fades on out . The light remains on the SENTRY an instant . The accordion player reprises the melody , then lays himself back on the ground . The light comes immediately up on the right side stage in a little eye-blink scene . Here in front of MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON 'S tent we see JOHN , the MAJOR  --  a man about thirty-five years old  --  and LIEUTENANT BLACK bending over a map . JOHN is now dressed in a Yankee private 's uniform. p. 141 MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON The bridge there is the key to our attack , John Freeman . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK The rebels keep pouring supplies over it . JOHN FREEMAN A symbol it was . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Glancing at him . Symbol ? JOHN FREEMAN But now no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KENNETH MAXTON To BLACK . General Buell says it 's got to be blown up . JOHN FREEMAN Yes . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK It 's a dangerous mission . JOHN FREEMAN We 've got to save Kentucky . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Right . His finger tracing along the map . Through this pass up the hill  --  then the back way to this ravine ? JOHN FREEMAN Yes . His voice is cold and unemotional . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Looking at him . But your own people are guarding this bridge ? JOHN FREEMAN Almost with a shout . It has to be that way ! p. 142 MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Plenty of that in this war  --  family against family  --  JOHN FREEMAN Lifting his head.  --  and brother against brother . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Lieutenant Black , you 'll have the men , engineers , plenty of demolition charges  --  we 'll march early . We should be there by tomorrow evening . We 'll attack about dawn . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK Yessir . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON To JOHN . You 'd better get some rest . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the darkness a voice shouts out . VOICE Halt , halt ! UNCLE EPH 'S VOICE Off-scene . It 's me  --  me  --  a friend ! Calling . John Free-ee-man ! The sound of a gunshot is heard . UNCLE EPH comes tearing into the scene from the right , looking behind him as he runs and dragging his gun . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Lord a-mercy , that fellow shot at me ! I hearn the bullet whing right by my ear . MAXTON has grabbed the scabbard of his sword and BLACK has pulled a pistol . UNCLE EPH runs up to JOHN . What do you mean , John Freeman , going off like this and leaving me behind ! If you 're gon na fight , I 'm gon na fight with you . p. 143 JOHN FREEMAN You go back home , Uncle Eph . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS If you can put down your conscience and take up a gun , I can too . Lifting his old musket . And I reckon with this here I 'll be good for a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ?

UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS I 've coon-hunted at night over every bit of it . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON All right , take the oath if you 're going with me . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK Hold up your hand . I 'll swear you . Repeat after me  --  UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Testily . I marched with Cassius Clay into Mexico fighting for liberty , and I reckon I know the oath . Holding up his hand and running off his words rapidly . I swear to uphold the constitution of the United States  --  to fight and defend the flag of my country  --  and to  --  and to  --  Dropping his hand suddenly  --  So help me God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ORDERLY Major , General Buell wants a conference in his tent right away . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON We 'll be there . The ORDERLY hurries back the way he came . This means the showdown battle at last , I hope . LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK Yeh , we want to get this war over , do n't we ? MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Come on , Private Freeman . You come too  --  oh  --  Cummings . UNCLE EPH CUMMINGS Just let them rebels show the whites of their eyes . Lead me to ' em ! He aims his gun before him as he goes . They all disappear into the darkness at the left . The scene fades out . The organ reprises a bit of " Just Before the Battle , Mother " for transition music , then begins playing an old carol . The light comes up on the center stage. p. 145 Act 2 , Scene 8 ACT TWO : Scene VIII In the hills near the bridge  --  same as Scene One of Act One  --  the next night just before dawn . DAVIE and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some lying wrapped up in their blankets and a number of others seated around a dull campfire where a battered old can of coffee is keeping hot . Among these last are DAVIE , JAKE ROSS , STUART EVANS , CHARLIE MERRITT , TOM SPARKS and LES ROWLAND . The Confederate flag is flying from a staff high on an eminence at the left rear . Presently the group by the fire begin singing softly , moodily as if half to themselves  --  as they stare at the fire . DAVIE looks up at the sky , then calls to some of the sleeping men . DAVIE FREEMAN You men-time to relieve the fellows at the bridge . Three soldiers reach for their guns and sleepily stand to their feet . The wild whistle of a train comes soaring through the night , followed by the rush of a locomotive and the rumble of its cars . DAVIE and the others look off at the left rear . The oncoming train thunders across the unseen bridge , its reverberations sounding among the hills , its whistle wailing . JAKE There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're hauling the stuff in there to beat them Yankees . p. 146 LES ROWLAND Beat ' em back ' crost the Ohio River ! DAVIE FREEMAN Long as we hold that bridge we 'll hold Kentucky . The final wailing of the train 's whistle comes back from the distance and then dies out . The three soldiers go on out at the back , DAVIE calling after them . Tell the fellows we got hot coffee for ' em . SOLDIER Yes sir . DAVIE leans toward the fire again . LES ROWLAND Yawning . Lord , ai n't daylight never coming ? DAVIE FREEMAN Glancing off . Beginning to show a glimmer there in the east  --  with the morning star . STUART EVANS And I 'm cold , cold . JAKE I 'm cold and sleepy . The men sit moodily around the fire . DAVIE leads off in the singing again . DAVIE AND SOLDIERS Sweet babe , she sang , my dearest son , &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art the Saviour born Who hast been sent from God above &nbsp; &nbsp; To save man all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save man all forlorn . p. 147 LES ROWLAND Yeah , I reckon at Christmastime the shepherds did n't get sleepy  --  watching that there star they tell about . They were expecting the birth of Jesus Christ . STUART EVANS This ai n't no place to talk about Jesus Christ . LES ROWLAND It 's a good place to talk about Jesus Christ . Grimly . Anyhow we ai n't expecting the Saviour . They hold their hands to the fire to warm them . Far away a rooster crows . They listen . JED WILLIS comes in at the left . DAVIE and his men stand up and salute . JED WILLIS Everything in order , Lieutenant Freeman ? DAVIE FREEMAN Yes sir , Major Willis . I checked the outposts ten minutes ago . We got a double guard on tonight like you said . JED WILLIS Good . He takes a tin cup from the ground and dips up a drink of coffee from the can . DAVIE FREEMAN There 's another troop train due up from the south in an hour . JED WILLIS I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left. - ready for any emergency . He drinks and sets the cup down again. p. 148 DAVIE FREEMAN You expecting trouble tonight ?  --  JED WILLIS I 'm always expecting trouble . So your brother John 's joined up with the Yankees ? DAVIE FREEMAN He 's over there with ' em somewhere . He gestures off before him . JED WILLIS And he knows every foot of these trails . DAVIE FREEMAN My Lord ! You think  --  JED WILLIS I 'm not thinking anything . Just be on the alert . He hurries back the way he came . CHARLIE MERRITT So your brother 's on the other side ? DAVIE FREEMAN Shut up . He kicks at the fire , then sits down , and they resume their singing . DAVIE AND SOLDIERS And therefore kneel we on our knee &nbsp; &nbsp; To worship his bright starThat guides all little children lost &nbsp; &nbsp; And wand ' ring from afarSing lay lullay and lullaby , And wand ' ring from afar . The men who have been relieved come in , cluster around the fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on his knees . The organ now begins to play the melody of the carol in a queer and ominous manner . DAVIE straightens up , the others likewise . They look around , then reach for their guns and sit listening . The organ continues its playing . The light dims down somewhat but remains on the flag . Advancing Yankee soldiers come down the roadways at the right and left , creeping silently forward , bending low , their guns at the ready . The group on the right is led by MAJOR MAXTON , that on the left by JOHN and LIEUTENANT BLACK . A Confederate soldier comes flying in at the left rear . DAVIE and his MEN spring up. p. 149 SOLDIER They 're coming along the creek there by the bridge , Lieutenant . DAVIE FREEMAN Sternly . Get back down there with your men . Behind the rocks , everybody . The SOLDIER dashes back the way he came . DAVIE and his men scatter to the rear and hide themselves behind the rocks and trees . JOHN FREEMAN Calling through the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREEMAN From the darkness at the rear . Go back , John ! Take your men back ! We do n't want to fight you . JOHN FREEMAN Calling . We ask you to surrender , Davie . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON You fool ! Yelling . The bridge , the bridge , John Freeman ! JOHN leads his men into the darkness and out at the left rear . MAXTON , blowing his whistle , tears down into the center scene with his men , his sabre drawn . His soldiers begin firing as they run . DAVIE 'S men let loose a volley . Some of MAXTON 'S men are wounded . One or two of them stagger , spin about and fall to the ground . The semi-darkness is broken by flashes of gunfire . Figures are seen running to and fro along the mountain side . DAVIE has brought his men out from behind the rocks . He charges MAXTON 'S group and drives them away back to the right. p. 150 DAVIE FREEMAN Make for the bridge ! We got to save the bridge ! He leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gunfire ' begin off-scene . We see flashes of fire lighting up the trees , and in the sound-track there is a turmoil of whistling bullets , musketry , cannon fire , all building toward a climax . The spotlight holds on the Confederate flag at the rear . The gunfire suddenly stops . The organ crashes out a chord and then just off the scene at the left rear comes an earth-shaking explosion , and streams of fire shoot up the sky . Yells of triumph are heard . The bridge has been blown up . The fighting begins again off-scene . DAVIE and his group are now driven in at the left rear . MAXTON and his men appear at the right front , firing as they come . WILLIS and several of his soldiers appear at the left front . A furious fight takes place about the flag-a hand to hand combat . JOHN and a few of his men enter at the rear . A flagbearer is carrying the Stars and Stripes but is shot down . JOHN grabs the flag and rushes up the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is torn down . JOHN is about to set up the Stars and Stripes in its place . A single shot is heard and . JOHN falls . LIEUTENANT BLACK catches the flag and fastens it in its Place . DAVIE runs back from his fleeing men and drops down by JOHN . The sounds of fighting die away. p. 151 MAXTON , BLACK AND OTHERS Cheering the flag . ' Ray , ' ray . Their cheering continues . JOHN tries to crawl to his knees and then topples forward . DAVIE lifts him up , holding him in his arms . The light steadies now , focusing on JOHN and DAVIE . DAVIE FREEMAN Heart-brokenly . John , John ! He tears part of his shirt off and stanches it against JOHN 'S side . Here and there about the scene lie the forms of several soldiers who have fallen in the battle . JOHN FREEMAN Gasping . Davie  --  for  --  forgive me , Davie ! DAVIE hugs JOHN to him , moaning in wordless grief . MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON Standing over JOHN . A great job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVIE FREEMAN Wildly . He 's hurt bad ! Help him ! MAJOR KENNETH MAXTON A brave man ! SOLDIERS Hooray for John Freeman ! ' Ray ! ' Ray ! MAXTON gestures behind him . BLACK comes forward and puts his hand on DAVIE 'S shoulder. p. 152 LIEUTENANT LEE BLACK You are our prisoner . DAVIE ignores him . In the distance cheering is heard . It continues as the scene fades out and the light comes up on the NARRATOR over at the right . THE NARRATOR Vibrantly , dynamically as the cheering fades . The defeat of the Confederate forces at the Battle of Perryville marked the turning point in the military struggle for Kentucky . This Union victory in which John Freeman played so great a part saved the state for the nation  --  and finally helped save the nation itself . And back in John Freeman 's valley  --  Gesturing to the left.  --  his war-weary neighbors greeted the news with jubilation and cheers . Victory  --  victory and peace ! they cried , even as some wondered  --  would they listen to John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light fades from the NARRATOR and comes up full on the center stage. p. 153 Act 2 , Scene 9 ACT TWO : Scene IX Before the church , an afternoon in autumn sometime later  --  same scene as the prologue of Act One . People are coming in from the right and the left , cheering , waving handkerchiefs , scarves , and little United States flags which they carry in their hands . PEOPLE Ad lib . The war is over . Victory , victory ! Thank the Lord the war is ended ! Yankee soldiers come in at the right waving their caps . Confederate soldiers come in at the left waving theirs . They hug one another and turn happily about . The Stars and Stripes still flies aloft at the rear . The organ has struck up the gay triumphant tune of " We 'll Rally Round the Flag . " More people come in . The young folks twirl one another about . The light brightens . We see DAVIE and ELSIE together , DAVIE with his arm in a sling and walking with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform . We see NEILL SIMS out in front of the scene , happy and vibrant in spite of his pegleg . We see the SIMSES , the MILLERS , UNCLE EPH , EXOM and DEBBIE , MURDOCK , and all our old neighbors . HENRY SIMS is there , dressed in Confederate gray , with ANNABELLE , also JED WILLIS , still an unreconstructed rebel , in his faded uniform . MILLER and SIMS are seen shaking hands . FEE is standing in front of the church at the back . NEILL holds up his hands for silence . The organ stops , the people grow still . NEILL gestures to FEE. p. 154 REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Loudly . Let us give thanks unto God for this great victory  --  that brings peace among us ! PEOPLE Fervently . Amen . REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE And in forgiveness and understanding we turn to the days ahead of us . The organ now begins playing the opening hymn " How Firm a Foundation , " but playing it like a funeral march . FEE moves forward into the scene from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right front come six young men , three in Confederate uniform and three in Yankee uniform . They are carrying a coffin between them , draped in a United States flag . The men take off their hats , the women bow their heads . Some of them put handkerchiefs to their faces . ELIZABETH FREEMAN comes over to the coffin as the men set it down . Others gather around . FEE steps forward as the organ fades out . Today we bring the body of John Freeman back home  --  to sleep among the hills and the people he loved . He did not believe in war . He did not believe in violence . He died with love in his heart , a love that says  --  God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth . He was a good man . PEOPLE Amen . REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Still he took up his gun to fight . Was he wrong ? Was he false to his ideals at the last ? I say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Out of the struggle in his soul I believe he did what he felt he had to do  --  not by hate for any man , not with the wish to harm any man , but that he might prove himself for his belief . Two thousand years ago our Saviour mounted the cross a sacrifice that his truth might live . He gave his precious life for you and me . So did John Freeman give his young life  --  all his hopes , his dreams , his days that were to be , that his truth might be justified . And he left to us the living , the solemn and sacred duty of proving that he did not die in vain . Some of the women are now sobbing . Several young girls come quietly in from the left with wreaths of wild flowers and stand near the coffin . FEE continues . Let us not weep . Let us put away our tears . Let us lift our heads in thanksgiving and pride for this our friend . A just and wise man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' yes . We do , John , we do . REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Looking down at the coffin . So , John Freeman , I finish the talk I promised I would . You were a teacher . You believed in the truth  --  the right to teach  --  to speak the truth . Inclusively and authoritatively to the people  --  as he puts his hand somewhat messianiccally on NEILL . Your work shall continue . p. 156 SIMS , DAVIE , ELSIE AND OTHERS Strongly . Yes , John Freeman . Yes , John . We promise you . REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE We will build your school ! PEOPLE Quickly , fervently . Yes , John . We 'll build it . Almost in unison  --  loudly , triumphantly . We 'll build the school ! REVEREND JOHN GREGG FEE Yea , Jed Willis ! WILLIS turns and with drawn unyielding sword goes hurriedly away at the right . He cuts his blade through the air as he disappears . The coffin is picked up now and lifted aloft . ELSIE bows her head , weeping silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes out strongly , affirmatively even , in the old song again . The men march away toward the right rear with the coffin and FEE steps back into the shadow toward the church and returns to his role as the PREACHER . The people start singing as they move off , ELSIE and DAVIE walking side by side , ELIZABETH and UNCLE EPH , the SIMSES , the MILLERS , old EXOM and DEBBIE , and others all following . PEOPLE Singing strongly . How firm a foundation , ye saints of the Lord , &nbsp; &nbsp; Is laid for your faith in his excellent word , What more can he say than to you he hath said , &nbsp; &nbsp; To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled .
