txt A proposal that President Truman be invited , or subpenaed if necessary , to testify in congress on his dismissal of Gen. was made tonight by Sen. Wiley ER. , Wis . ) Wiley , a member of the senate committee investigating the case , said in a statement the committee should summon the President because top Truman aids have " stymied " the committee by refusing to answer questions bearing on White House conferences leading up to-the firing of the general . Wiley r.oted that Mr. Truman has given information at press conferences about the removal that the senate committee was unable to elicit from Gen. Bradley , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , and Defense Secretary Marshall . Truman Does It All " He , himself , " said Wiley of Mr. Truman , " has taken on the entire burden of explaining just how and why the dis ? missal came about . He has said that the decision was his and that his aids went along with him . But when we asked his aids to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House conversations , they refused to do so . As a result our committee is stymied . " Wiley said he had intention of questioning the President about trivial matters and that his position as head of the state zhould be fully respected . " I am firmly convinced , however , " he continued , " that if the President were to appear before us , preferably voluntarily , and were ' Zo testify regarding his approach to the crucial issues of our times , it would have a tremendously salutary effect in encouraging as much unity as possible among parties and with the American people . " Testimony " Most Helpful " With American soldiers dying in Korea and the threat of World War III impending , Wiley said , the President 's testimony would " be most helpful . " " If the President refused , " the senator said , " the joint committee might very well consider subpenaing him . " Neither the White House nor Committee Chairman Russell 1D. , Ga. would comment on the Wiley proposal . Russell likewise refused to discuss Wiley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President to remove the " iron curtain " on the case by letting Bradley answer questions about discussions that preceded the firing . Russell told reporters Gen. will be recalled , if he wishes to be heard , to reply to administration witnesses who have argued against the Korean war policy . Taft lilt at Truman The committee will resume Its hearings Monday with Gen. Bradley returning to the witness stand . Bradley will be followed by other members of the joint chiefs of staff , Army Secretary Pace , end State Secretary Acheson . Meanwhile , Sen. Taft ER. , O. termed " nonsense " Mr. Truman 's contention that a cut in arms spending , as proposed by Taft , would be inconsistent with a more aggressive drive in Korea . Taft said in a speech- to the Panama Canal society that the President " has . keen fit to attack and misrepresent " his proposal that the Truman goal of 31/2 million men in arms be cut to 3 millions .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
