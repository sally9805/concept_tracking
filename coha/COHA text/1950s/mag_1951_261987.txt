Five months ago New Zealand dared a risky experiment : suspension of civil liberties to deal with a Red attack . <P> New Zealand ( pop . 1,850,000 ) lives by her seaborne trade . But for 16 years New Zealand 's ports had been in the grip of the Communist-led Wraterside Workers ' Union . * When the Cominform signaled a stepped-up cold war against the democracies four years ago , the union 's headlock on New Zealand trade quickly slipped into a stranglehold . <P> Tough Regulations . Last February , faced with a new dock strike , conservative Prime Minister Sidney Holland decided he would not permit the Communists to use democracy in order to destroy it . He announced a state of national emergency , declared the Waterside Workers an illegal organization , seized its funds . Soldiers , sailors and airmen were ordered to load ships . <P> Tough , able Sidney Holland invoked a set of emergency regulations . He used his powers sparingly , but in some instances suspended the right of assembly , public speech or public print . Newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions were not allowed to hold public discussions of the strike issues or on the emergency regulations . Anyone giving aid &; comfort to strikers or their families was threatened with jail . But police did not lay a finger on the Red bosses . <P> Most New Zealanders quietly accepted such curbs of their liberties as a necessity of war . Miners , meat-freezing and hydroelectric workers struck in sympathy with the dockers and against the emergency regulations , but there was little violence , few arrests . <P> Slow Stranglehold . The union bosses hoped to defeat Holland by dislocating New Zealand trade . Thousands of tons of perishable goods piled up in warehouses . Farmers lost money , local factories closed down for lack of raw materials . Sugar supplies ran out , homes were without heat , gas and power were rationed . Trade loss : an estimated $200,000,000 . <P> But Holland stubbornly refused to deal with the Red unionists , set his hopes on a new Communist-free dockers ' union , sponsored by the government . By last week , the Red strike was broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to work . The Waterside Workers ' Union had virtually ceased to exist ; its Communist leaders were thoroughly discredited . <P> The Reds stalemated , Prime Minister Holland was expected to revoke the emergency regulations . New Zealanders felt that democracy , stern though its measures were , had won an important victory . <P> <P> *The dockers ' unions in New Zealand and Australia maintain close contact with Communist Harry Bridges ' International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union on the U.S. West Coast , in Vancouver and Hawaii , with them exercise effective control over Pacific shipping .
