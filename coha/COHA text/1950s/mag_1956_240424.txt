It seemed like the winter Olympics all over again . For the world championships , figure skaters had moved to the big ice stadium built by Adolf Hitler at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Bavarian Alps . Colorado 's Hayes Jenkins repeated his Cortina victory ; when the women finished their school figures . Defending Champion Tenley Albright seemed to have a slight lead over Long Island 's Carol Heiss , just as she had had in the Olympics . The " Skating Mothers " were still on hand , still complaining about accommodations , still intent on a family triumph . <P> " Mother ! " moaned Carol when the early standings had her still skating in Tenley 's shadow . " Now , now , " soothed Mrs. Heiss , who had not come to Germany to lose . " It 's not over yet . " She was right . The official school-figure scores gave Carol a slight lead . When the free skating began , the title was up for grabs . <P> Poised and confident as she had been at Cortina , Tenley skated out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jersey , she danced across the ice to the music of Offenbach 's Orpheus in the Underworld . Satisfied with her performance , she said : " If that does n't do it , I ca n't do it . " <P> Later , Carol made her bid , her green costume and rhinestone choker glittering through a light snowfall . She , too , repeated her Olympic performance . As she whirled and leaped to the beat of Adolphe Adam 's If I Were King , her near-flawless execution brought the chilled crowd to its feet . Even one of the judges broke into spontaneous applause . When the scores were announced , the 16-year-old trouper , after a long year of competition as an also-ran , was the world champion . " Mother , " she cried , " I did it ! I did it ! "
