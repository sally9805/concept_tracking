A CENTURY or so ago a Harvard graduate wrote a hymn whose opening line , plausible enough when written , turned out to be one of the most inaccurate forecasts ever set down : The morning light is breaking , the darkness . disappears . The final couplet of that stanza , however , would ? with the omission of a single word ? be a fairly accurate picture of the world today : Each breeze that sweeps the ocean brings tidings from afar Of nations in commotion , prepared for Zion 's war . Commotion indeed ; but it is not Zion 's war for which they are preparing . Yet in his day the Reverend Samuel F. Smith seemed to have good reason for his confidence in the success of the missionary enterprises that were then spreading over the world ; and not only in their direct success but in the derivative benefits that would Ilow from them . He had faith ? not only faith in his religion ; but back of that , like most men of his day , lie had the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely successful nineteenth century ; an assurance that it had not only a religion but a culture which was so good in itself that it was the Christian duty of all who possessed it to extend it to less favored races . To its intended beneficiaries that assurance must often have seemed arrogance . Especially as expressed in the most famous missionary hymn of the time .11y many an ancient river , from many a palmy plain , They call us to deliver their souls from error 's chain . The call was audible mostly to the inner ear , but there it rang loudly . Shall we whose souls are lighted by wisdom from on high , Shall we to men benighted the lamp of life deny ? Responding to that appeal , many men and women went forth into the foreign field , performed the most heroic , arduous , and often hazardous labors , and sometimes laid down their lives . We owe them the utmost respect ; yet I am sure we all wish that the appeal had been . phrased more tactfully . The missionary techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , when he gave his subjects the choice between accepting the lamp of life and getting their throats cut , he did n't pretend that they had asked for it . But Bishop Heber and the Reverend Samuel Smith profoundly believed what they wrote , as did most men of their time . The principal group that disagreed with them , the Hardsliell Baptists , did so only in an even greater faith ? that when God chose to save the heathen He could do it by Himself , without the help of contributors to foreign missions . Logically and theologically they seem to have had the better of the argument ; but they were a feeble and dwindling group because the vast majority was inspired , for the most part unconsciously , by a faith which comprehended and transcended theology . The great Protestant missionary effort of the nineteenth century , like the great Catholic missionary effort of the sixteenth century , was the expression of a strong and vigorous culture ? different phases only of the culture of what we call the Western world , though a Polynesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? In the sixteenth century the West Was just awakening , with a delighted surprise , to an awareness of its own strength , which had seemed gravely in question in the opening phases of the Turkish onslaught . By the nineteenth century the West had no doubt that it was the culmination of all human progress to date , with even more dazzling achievements lying beyond . In the middle of the twentieth century the principal questions in dispute among Western intellectuals seem to he whether the West can be saved , and if it is worth saving . The two most popular of recent historical philosophers both think the Western world is going down hill , and one of them seems to feel that it wo n't be much loss . Spengler appreciated the loss more than Toynbee ; if he felt that it was inevitable , that was perhaps because he was an artist rather than a philosopher . Yet , though it may be only a coincidence , it is certainly a disquieting one that he and Toynbee , starting from very different premises , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of development that our civilization has reached ; and still more disquieting , as to whatlies ahead ? what Spengler called Caesarism , and Toynbee the universal state . There are optimists of course who think that a really universal state ? a world-wide state ? could be created by some other means than military force ; Spengler and Toynbee are not among them nor , to compare small things with great , am 1 . So long as Communists remain Communists any world coalition government would be subject to the same dangers , and likely to meet the same fate , as the coalition governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia ; and there is still wisdom enough in the West not to run that risk . Others think that even if a universal state were created by military force , the result would not be Caesarism ? provided of course that our side won . A couple of years ago Bertrand Russell was one of these ; lately he seems to have become discouraged , and offers us the variant but not very cheerful prospect of a dual Caesarism , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and . collaborating to suppress dissent in both their realms . I do not suppose that Russell was entirely serious in suggesting this ; he may only have been reading Orwell 's 1984 , or he may have been reading the Congressional Record . Such a future seems improbable ; but in the world we live in , no one can be sure that it is impossible . II s PENGLER is dead and can write no more ; he has said his say ; within his artistic scheme , the progressive deterioration of any culture seemed inevitable . Any man who keeps on writing and talking is likely to contradict himself ; Toynbee has written so much that he has involved himself in about as many contradictions as Dr. John H. Watson , when he set down the history of Sherlock Holmes . A few years ago Toynbee seemed to have some hope that the creative minority of our civilization had not yet lost its creativity , not yet become a merely dominant minority , for the inadequacy of whose rule the internal proletariat would have to compensate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think we have passed the point of no return . We passed it , apparently ? or at least so he thought when he delivered the Reith Lectures last year ; he may since have changed his mind again ? we passed it toward the end of the seventeenth century , when men became disgusted with the endless religious wars which neither side ever decisively won , and turned to secular interests ? turned from preoccupation with preparation for the next world to consideration of what could be done with this one ; and , increasingly , to what could he done with it through technology . And for this apostasy. thinks Toynbee , God has punished us ? punished the West by the loss of the East ; not only our territorial possessions and our commerce there but our moral influence in an East which increasingly turns toward our Communist enemy . The East rejected our religion , and our technology with it , when they were parts of an indivisible way of life ; it accepted our technology when it was divorced from our religion ( and incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more worth accepting ) with consequences which became apparent at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and more recently in Korea . " The fortunes , " he says , " of ' Western civilization in the mission field veered right around from conspicuous failures to conspicuous successes as soon as its attitude toward its own ancestral religion had veered around from a warm devotion to a cool skepticism . " Which appears to mean , when the mission field had become the field of a new kind of missionary , offering no longer the lamp of life but oil for the lamps of China , and all that went with it . History does not support this interpretation . It has lately been subjected to a number of searching criticisms ? notably by Professor Michael Karpovitch in the New Leader and by G. F. Hudson in Commentary . Karpovitch , after pointing out that Toynbee is wrong on all the things that Karpovitch knows most about , suavely admits that no doubt lie is right in other fields . Hudson makes a more general attack on the entire doctrine , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnotes . The great success of Protestant missions ? not to mention a vigorous revival of Catholic missions , and the beginnings of the penetration of the East by Western technology as well ? came at a time when the cool skepticism of the eighteenth century had been buried under a new wave of evangelical fervor ; when Protestantism was not only as vigorous but as dogmatic as the Catholicism of the Counter-Reformation . ( I do not knowwhether Toynbee regards Modernist Protestantism as a religion at all ; but he can hardly deny that title to Fundamentalist Protestantism . ) What at present appears to be the failure of Protestantism in China seems to be due less to divine wrath at apostasy than to an intensified form of the thing that caused the eventual failure of Catholicism in Japan , when it had lost little if any of its energy and fervor in Europe ? the fear of a suspicious and despotic government that religion had been merely the cover for imperialistic political intrigues . In either case there was little evidence on which to base that fear ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , who still feel insecure . I T MIGHT indeed be argued that the West , in its relation with the East , is being punished for its sins ; hut . the sin is not apostasy , it is too great faith . The sin that is most surely and sharply punished is a mistake ? however well intended , however it may have seemed at the time the thing to do . The punishment is often delayed , and falls on the descendants of those who made the mistake ; often on innocent bystanders . " Those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell , and slew them ? think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ? " We are authoritatively assured that they were not ; the sin was that of the architect or the contractor , the punishment fell on people who only happened to be around . Many Europeans and Americans have suffered in Asia , and may presently suffer in Africa , for mistakes for which they were in no way responsible ? mistakes made from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the theological religion of the West , which in the past two and a half centuries has had its ups as well as its downs , there was growing up in ' Western Europe and America a secular religion , held as fervently by devout Christians as by rationalists ? the faith in freedom , in self-government , in democracy . ( Indeed the only living ex-President of Columbia University has more than once implied that only believers in a theological religion can believe in this secular religion too . The evidence for this can not be found in history . ) The Westerners who interpenetrated the East in the nineteenth century , whether missionaries , engineers , business men , or administrators , mostly carried this religion with them . They made many mistakes ; but it was devotion to this secular religion that led them to make what , from the standpoint of practical consequences , was the worst mistake the West ever made in dealing with the East . They educated the natives . Not merely in the operation of modern weapons , for the greater convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith , faith in the whole Western culture of which this secular religion was becoming steadily a more important part . Many of those whom they educated sprang from cultures far older than ours , and in some respects more distinguished ; but it was the Western culture that seemed to work ; so it did not have to be forced on them ; in this case they really did call us to deliver their minds , at least , from error 's chain . We educated them in Western medicine and engineering , in Western government and law . And in the course of that education the pupils were exposed to the fact that there were such things as freedom and self-government and democracy ? things which the educators obviously regarded as good for themselves ; it was only a question of time till the pupils began to suspect that they might be good for everybody . Educate any man , of whatever race or color , in what lie did n't know before and you are taking a chance ; how lie will turn out will depend somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on what was in him to start with ; you may get a Nehru and you may get a Jomo Kenyatta . The one thing they have in common is a conviction that those who educated them , having fulfilled that function , ought to get out . I have enough faith in that secular religion to believe that in the long run the consequences of this will be beneficial ? as they seem to be already in the successor states of the Indian Empire . But that is no consolation to those on whom various towers of Siloam have fallen elsewhere . III HIS digression was necessitated by the fact that the most popular of contem-porary historians has offered an explana-tion not only for our unsatisfactory relations with Asia and Africa , but for the general dilemma of our times ? an explanation which not only to me but to many of my betters seems no explanation at all . But what then is the matter with us ? What have we left , if anything , that is worth saving ? This first and obvious answer , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving , who is ? " Faulty as we are , we seem infinitely preferable ? by our standards ? to the moral nihilism and intellectual rigidity of the Soviet system which is competing with us for the allegiance of the East ; competing indeed , though with little success outside of France and Italy , for the allegiance of our own citizens . Unfortunately , we do not always seem preferable to those among whom our missionaries , and those of the opposition , are working ; and if through force or deception they have once accepted the opposition 's gospel they find that the choice is irrevocable . Rebels on the barricades would be blown to pieces by tanks and bombing planes ; indeed the secret police would never let anybody get to the barricades in the first place . G. F. Hudson ? following Orwell ? holds that modern totalitarian techniques would make impossible even Toynbee 's last refuge for the disconsolate , wheresoe'er they languish ? the creation by the internal proletariat of a universal church to compensate for the shortcomings of a universal state . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the resources of the MVD at his disposal , the early Christians would have been publicly confessing how in their vileness they had set fire to Rome on instructions of the King of Parthia . " In the world we hive in , freedom once lost is lost to stay lost . We had better remember that , in dealing with our internal even more than with our external problems . Granted however that from anything that could he called an ethical viewpoint we are better worth saving than our adversaries , this is no proof that we are going to be saved unless we have the qualities that enable us to save ourselves . Faulty as was the western Roman Empire , it was far more worth saving than the barbarian tribal dominions that surrounded it and eventually overran it ; but its own faults brought it down . This is worth mentioning since not only Spengler and Toynbee , but lesser men . have dealt with our predicament in terms of what befell civilizaLions of the past ; and these analyses , however embellished with facts , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rest pretty much on the one case about which we have tolerably complete information ? the decline and fall of the Roman Empire . Many historians have attempted to explain it ; almost all of them , even Gibbon ? even Rostovtzeff ? seem to me to explain it largely in terms of their own experience , and observation of their own times . I SHALL riot add to that confusion , but shall only point out one or two details in which our situation is different . We know now that the happiness and prosperity of the age of the Antonines , which so impressed Gibbon , was only relative ; considerable no doubt compared to what had gone before and what was to come afterward ; but behind the splendid front there was a dry rot inside . Economically the Empire was deteriorating , and intellectually too . Economically the Western world is doing pretty well nowadays ; and in the English-speaking and Scandinavian countries the problem that Rome never solved and that finally did more than anything else to bring Rome down has been solved with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , of seeing that everybody gets some of it . If France and Italy solved that problem too , the Communist parties in those countries would soon shrink to the hard core . Our civilization , says Rostovtzeff ? lately echoed and emphasized by Professor Robinson of Brown ? our civilization will not last unless it be a civilization not of one class but of the masses . This is a warning that might more pertinently be directed toward the Soviet Union than the United States , in so far as what exists in the Soviet Union can be called a civilization . As for Rostovtzeff 's last despairing question , " Is not every civilization bound . to decay as soon as it penetrates the masses ? " we can only say that we shall in due course find out . We have started in that direction and we ca n't turn back . The Romans , outside of the cities , never got started ; and even there civilization was a narrowing pyramid , with a hollow top . The most notable thing ' about the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rest between calamities when the - Western worldmight have made vast advances , and fortified itself against the calamities that were to come ; the classic case of what Toynbee calls the loss of creativity in the dominant minority . Are we losing it ? Dr. J. G. de Betts of the Netherlands Embassy in Washington , who has lately analyzed these forecasts of the future , thinks the Western world is still vigorously creative ? not only in science and technology , but in politics , domestic and foreign ; and in art and letters as well . It is perhaps fortunate that this optimistic view was set down before the recent sculptural competition in London for a statue of the Unknown Political Prisoner , where the prize was given to a contraption in wire that looked like nothing , unless perhaps a television aerial . As for letters , most of the most admired literature of the Western nations ? especially the English-speaking nations ? for thirty-five years past has been to all appearance the effluvium of a sick society . English literature , between wars , gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution from its own internal weakness ? a nation that would collapse in ruins as soon as somebody pushed . But the time came when somebody pushed , and it did not collapse ; indeed the people who did the pushing eventually did the collapsing too . Many American novelists have written about the late war . Most of their works would be intelligible if written by Frenchmen after 1870 , or Spaniards after 1898 ? mercilessly candid pictures of the inner decay that led to calamitous defeat . But since we happened to win the war , something seems to have been wrong with the picture ? not no doubt with the individual picture which each man saw ; but with the total picture which few of them ever noticed . This phenomenon is a symptom of what has been called the alienation of intellectuals from the life around them , which is taken very seriously by intellectuals . I can not see that it makes much difference . The intellectuals wrote their books , which often sold widely ; the society around them bought ? the books , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored them when the chips were down ; men who had spent their lives proving that the United States was not worth fighting for went out and fought for it like everybody else . IV T HE first condition of the survival of any civilization is that it should win its wars . Rome did , till its armies wore themselves out fighting one another . I think that from the military point of view we could win the next war , if we should have to fight it , despite the weakness of our air defense in the northeastern approaches . But to win a war under modern conditions requires more than military strength ? more even than preservation of a sound dollar . It requires political shrewdness , domestic and foreign , to a degree the Romans seldom had to practice . For five centuries after the battle of Magnesia they had virtually no need for a foreign policy , till the degenerate days when they found it necessary to make an alliance with one German tribe against another . The United States , as the prima inter pares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth not long ago by the President , who has had more experience in dealing with coalitions than any other man since Metternich . It would not he easy to cope with them , even if he had the actual ( though not the theoretical ) power of a Roman Emperor ; it is not so easy in a republic whose Constitution , as Woodrow Wilson once put it , permits the President to be as big a man as he can . If he can not be or does not want to be a big man , there will be plenty of others who will volunteer to fill the vacancy . What a civilization like out by one or the other of those methods ? good men as well as bad . The nations which embody Western civilization are no longer subject to that danger , but their political systems have other defects . Mr. Walter Lippmann remarks that if the free world is in peril , it is not because our enemies are so strong , but because the free nations are so badly governed ; and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national legislatures .... Well ? we must discriminate . In the nations of the British Commonwealth the supremacy of the legislature is the essence of their constitutions , and , they have learned how to make it work . In the French Republic it is also the essence of the constitution ; in the three-quarters of a century of the Third and Fourth Republics they have not learned how to make it work In our own republic it is in flat conflict with the Constitution , and no wonder it does n't work . It is an old story ; long before the present publicized attacks on the State Department , and on the President 's control of foreign policy , the principal problem of our government was congressional usurpation , usually through committees , of executive functions . Congress not only tells administrators what they must do , which is its right ; but how to do it , which is not its right , and is wholly outside Congress 's field of practical competence as well as of authority . A Congress which ate raw meat during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not going back to a milk diet just because the Republicans are in power . Nor would it do so even in wartime unless compelled , as it has been compelled by every strong President . Until the question whether it would be so compelled again may arise , we might reflect that all the periods of congressional government in our history have been periods either of bad government or of do-nothing government . There have been times when we could afford a do-nothing government ; we can afford it no longer . Still less a bad government . But to return from this digression into the factors that will make it practically possible ? or practically impossible ? to save us ; back to the original question , Why should we be saved ? What have we got that our adversaries have not that makes us worth saving ? Our faults , God knows , are numerous and glaring enough ; recognition of those faults is the chief cause of the loss of confidence that has afflicted so many people of the Western world . But we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decreed by ineluctable historical necessity ; nor do we rewrite history according to the precepts of Double-think , to prove that they never happened at all , What we have to offer , to the contemporary world and to the future , is a method ; and the freedom of the mind that makes that method possible . Not an infallible method , but the best yet discovered for reaching increasingly closer approximations to the truth . It will never offer its conclusions with such assurance as does dialectical materialism ? which , by a singular coincidence , always seems to produce the conclusions that are convenient for the men in power . It can only say , We have kept the door open for exploration of all possibilities , consideration of all objections , application of all possible tests ; and this is what seems to be true . Maybe something else will seem more probable later on , but this is the best we can do now . Or , as the method was summarized long ago ? Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . Outside the Western world it does not exist , except in those parts of the East which have been influenced by Western thought ; if it died here , it would die there too . President Conant has remarked that the right to think and question and investigate is the basic difference between the free world and the world of totalitarianism . It might well be the basic difference that would save us , if it came to a shooting war ; and whether it does that or not , this one thing ? the scientific method , and above all the freedom of the mind that makes it possible ? is what makes us worth saving . As G. F. Hudson has observed , " To repudiate faith in freedom is to abandon Western civilization . " The founders of this republic held that faith so firmly that its guarantee was embedded in the very first amendment to the Constitution ? almost a part of the original document . Yet lately that faith has been repudiated by many of our fellow-citizens , ifindeed they ever held it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this , rather than any external attack , that might bring us down . That repudiation takes various forms , and appears on various levels . One phase of it was the recent attack on the Bureau of Standards and particularly the manner in which the Secretary of Commerce questioned its objectivity . As Eugene Rabinow itch lately wrote in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scieritials , the government has the right , if it should so choose , to subordinate the findings of science to the demands of business ; but it has no right to attempt to coerce the scientists into adjusting their findings to those demands . That is Lysenkoism ; it is something we had better leave to the enemy . B UT far more widespread and more dan- gerous is the general attack on the freedom of the mind . George Kerman said at Notre Dame that it springs from forces too diffuse to be described by their association with the name of any one man or any one political concept ; forces which perhaps were summarized by John Duncan Miller of the London Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt of the primitives against intelligence . Unfortunately it can not be denied that after centuries of education we still have plenty of primitives ? some of them white-collar or even top-hat primitives ; a sediment , a sludge , at the bottom of American society ? and I am afraid a fairly deep layer at that ; people who seem actuated only by hatred and fear and envy . All the products of ignorance ; for their fear is not a rational fear of a very formidable and unfriendly foreign power ; I have received thousands of letters from people like that in recent years and they do not seem interested in Russia at all . They appear to regard communism as a purely American phenomenon ; what they hate and fear is their own neighbors who try to think . In the name of anti-communism they try to strike down the freedom of the mind , which above all things differentiates us from the Communists ; in the name of Americanism they try to suppress the right to think what you like and say what you think , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reasoned conviction at all ? that the principles on which this Republic was founded and has been operated will not bear examination . That of course is not true ; but if we do not stand up and resist the people who feel that way , this movement toward suppression will be successful . It is people who feel that way who provide the mass support for McCarthy ; though of course he has an elite support as well , if it may he so termed , in the reactionary press and the Texas oil billionaires . He has already done serious injury to the United States government ? especially to the State Department , on which we must chiefly rely for avoidance of war ; and he has done more than any other man to encourage the spread of suspicion and distrust and hatred among ourselves , which is the best formula for losing a war . We have now reached the point where , if agents of the FBI appear in the home town of a prominent man and begin asking questions about him , his neighbors know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is destined to appointment to high office in the United States government . I doubt if such confusion is healthy . I venture to remind you of the remark by judge Learned Hand , in a speech so often quoted that perhaps you all know it by heart ; nevertheless T remind you that he said he believes that that community is already in process of dissolution where each man begins to eye his neighbor as a possible enemy , where non-conformity with the accepted creed is a mark of disaffection ; where denunciation takes the place of evidence and orthodoxy chokes freedom of dissent . If we are not to become such a community , the friends of freedom will have to stand up and fight . Some men who have sentimental predilections in favor of freedom lack the guts to fight . The State Department ran out on the appointment of Mildred McAfee Horton because it was afraid of a fight in the Senate . ( This is not a conjecture or an inference ; it is a fact . ) The Department offered the charitable explanation that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem afraid of it at all ; but it would certainly have been unpleasant for the State Department , which weeps with delight when McCarthy gives it a smile , and trembles with fear at his frown . For the last few minutes I have been talking , not about Western civilization , but about the United States . And without apology , for we are the principal component of Western civilization , at least in the material sense ; if we go down it all goes down ? and when we confront a totalitarian dictatorship , whatever goes down stays down ; it does n't get up again . And we shall go down , unless we recognize what we have to fight for , and have the courage to fight for it . What makes Western civilization worth saving is the freedom of the mind , now under heavy attack from the primitives ? including some university graduates ? who have persisted among us . If we have not the courage to defend that faith , it wo n't matter much whether we are saved or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I do not think that Malenkov and Molotov , Bcria and Bulganin , can lick us . But McCarthy and the spirit of McCarthyism could lick us ? no doubt without intention , but they could ; by getting us to fighting among ourselves like the Romans , by persuading every man that he must keep on looking over his shoulder , to make sure that the man beside him does n't stab him in the back . There is still enough vitality in Western civilization to save us , unless we insist on disemboweling ourselves . I should perhaps have begun this sermon with a text , a text taken from the fourth chapter of the first book of Samuel , the eighth and ninth verses ? the mutual exhortations- of the Philistines before the battle of Ebenezer . " Woe unto us ! " they said , when they realized that the Israelites had brought the Ark of God with them to battle . " Woe unto us ! Who shall deliver us out of the hands of these mighty gods ? " But then , realizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another , " Be strong , and quit yourselves like men ; and fight . " And they did fight , and delivered themselves . So may we ; but only if we quit ourselves like men . This republic was not established by cowards ; and cowards will not preserve it .
