Another angry debate broke out in Ottawa last week on the issue of U.S. investment in Canada ( TIME , April 30 ) . It was touched off by a government measure , introduced in Parliament , to lend up to $80 million to Trans-Canada Pipe Lines , Ltd. , a company more than 80% owned and controlled by U.S. gas and oil interests headed by Texas Millionaire Clint Murchison . The loan is to be used to build the first leg ( Alberta to Winnipeg ) of a long-delayed transcontinental natural-gas pipeline . <P> Opposition Tory and C.C.F. ( Socialist ) parties , which have been accusing the Liberal government of giving too much leeway to U.S. investors , reacted angrily to the proposal to lend tax funds to a U.S.-controlled firm . Both parties immediately launched a filibuster to delay the bill . The government 's main reason for backing the U.S. firm is that Trans-Canada has pipe and equipment on hand to begin work immediately . A national election is expected next year , and the Canadian public , the Liberals believe , is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the nationality of the builders .
