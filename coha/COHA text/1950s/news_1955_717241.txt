txt The State Liquor Authority ' thinks that New York City may have reached the saturation point in restaurants licensed toy sell wine and liquor . Thomas E. Rohan , authorityl chairman , announced yesterday that a survey was being made to determine if this surmise was correct . At the same time the authority imposed a ninety-day ' moratorium on accepting new . applications for restaurant li censes . Hardship cases , including " extreme emergency " ori " exceptional circumstances , " wig get a sympathetic ear . The survey , first of its kind , was prompted by religious groups and persons in the liquor trade . On April 30 the city had 7,940 restaurants licensed to sell liquor , wine or both . Of these , 3,259 were in Manhattan ; 1,953 in Brooklyn ; 917 in the BronX ; 1,490 in Queens and 321 in Staten Island . In addition the five boroughs have 2,036 liquor package stores . The 1950 census showed 6,984 licensed restaurants and 2,183 package stores . Per Capita Use Declines While sales volume went up in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . City historians say the city has fewer drinking spots in proportion to population than it had a century ago . Excluding persons under 18 years old , who are not entitled to buy liquor here , the present , ratio is approximately 770 potential customers for each licensed , restaurant and 3,000 customers for each package store  --  not counting visitors to the city . - Mr. Rohan is asking all licensed restaurants in the city to submit confidential data on their business experience to him . The information presumably includes volume of sales from year tol year , and possibly estimates of future volume . He said factual information was essential " to a sound apIpraisal of representations that I have been made to the authority that there are more than ' sufficient licensed restaurants in New York City at the present1 time . " The authority 's ninety - dayl moratorium will be effective from next Monday through Oct. 31 . " To obviate any undue hardship resulting from the moratorium , " Mr. Rohan said , " Rule 34-A of the authority , under , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under specified conditions , or where extreme emergency or exceptional circumstances require such consideration . " Rule Extended S Months The authority also extended ' its Rule 34for three months tot Oct. 31 . This rule , state-wide in application , requires any applicant for a new restaurant , hotel or eating place license to furnish satisfactory proof that he has operated the establishment ( without liquor ) for ( ninety days prior to filing . Officers of the United Restaurant Liquor Dealers were attending a state convention yesterday in Salamanca , N. Y. Andrew Whelan , executive secretary of the Manhattan group , said no statement of its reaction to the authority 's move would be Made until the convention was finished . The authority has been under investigation by J. Irwin Shapiro , State Commissioner of Investigation . Since the inquiry began four months ago , seventeen officials have resigned , one has been dismissed and one committed suicide . One of Commissioner Shapiro 's investigators said on June 28 that there had been " a tremendous amount of graft " in the liquor authority , which he described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time investigators outlined three general categories of corruption , without giving spe2 cific examples . The worst type , they said , ' pertained to restaurant facilities in taverns . All taverns , by state law , must be able to serve food to , customers . Very often , it was found , investigators have collected $25 or $50 from bar owners who found it more expedient to pay the bribe than to argue an infraction and face suspension of the license . A second main opportunity for graft applies to package stores . If the holder of a license wants to move to a neighborhood with better business opportunities , according to the investigators , he often has to pay a bribe to get the authority 's permission . One investigator said that the number . of completely legitimate removals was " infinitesimal . " The investigators found a third opportunity for corruption through ? substantial fees paid in some cases to lawyers who settle disagreements between license holders and representatives of the authority .
