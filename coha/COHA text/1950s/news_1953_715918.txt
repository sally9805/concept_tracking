txt Discovery in Colorado of a fossil bed containing eight " practically perfect " skulls of the dawn horse , earliest known ancestor of the horse and one of the most famous of all prehistoric animals , was announced today by the American Museum of Natural History . The find , made in Huerfano valley 90 miles south of Colorado Springs and northwest of Walsenberg , was described by Dr. George Gaylord Simpson , chairman of the museum 's department of geology and paleontology , as being potentially " the richest single find known of mammals of the Eocene epoch , dating back 50 to 60 million years . " H ors e s , the Encyclopaedia Britannica says , survived in North America thru the Pleistocene period and then died out . Modern European horses were reintroduced on the continent in 1540 by the Spaniards . Few Previous Skulls Our knowledge of the dawn horse , or Eohippus , Dr. Simpson said , has been incomplete , as only a few skulls have previously been discovered and all of them were quire imperfect . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know we have eight practically perfect skulls , and more will probably turn up . Eohippus was a small animal ranging in size from 10 inches high at the shoulders to approximately half the size of a Shetland pony . It had progressed far enough along the evolutionary scale to show some ' of the beginnings of the characteristic equine dental structure and to have developed a herbivorous diet . Has Stout Tall However , it still retained some of the characteristics of the primitive mammals , such as a very simple brain , four toes on each foot , and a long , stout tail . The Eohippus bones are thickly embedded in rock that to avoid damaging them in the field a good sized petrified zoc was taken out in a single large block of rock and bones weighing about two tons . " The pain . staking process of removing the bones from the rock without in. jury may take several years , " Dr. Simpson said .                    @
