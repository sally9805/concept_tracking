A true gamecock is a perfect fighting machine . Back of him are centuries of breeding which have preserved his gameness , his lightning quickness and his ability to strike with power far beyond what might be suspected in a chicken . His plumage glistens with a radiance unknown among his cousins of the barnyard . When conditioned for the pit his endurance is mighty . In his prime he is the spirit of arrogance and in combat the only thing that stops him is death . // These traits , embodied in this descendant of the wild Asiatic jungle fowl , are why cockfighting is still one of the world 's most widespread sports . Scenes such as those in the photographs on the following pages , taken at a Puerto Rican cockpit , are duplicated with variations in Europe , Asia and North and South America . // To many outside the cockfighting fraternity it is not a sport at all but a cruel pastime which should be stamped out . In this country almost every state has laws against it . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most thriving illegal sports in the U.S. // To most people in the U.S. cockfighting is like a summer breeze . It is all around them but they never see it . Once in a while they hear a rustle when the authorities raid a cockpit and haul the chicken fighters and their birds off to court . The usual result is that the game cocks are seized and their owners fined . The latter shrug their shoulders with the attitude of an oppressed minority and look for a safer place to hold their fights . // Despite its illegality , members of the fraternity know that in this country their sport is experiencing a boom . Cockfighting has several successful " trade " magazines ( among them The Gamecock and Grit and Steel ) which openly advertise forthcoming tournaments . Mains and hackfights are being held in barns and cockpits over most of the nation . At a recent tournament in Florida 128 battles were staged over a four-day period to decide the ownership of $11,000 . This purse , of course , was in addition to the pitside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gameness and prowess of their birds but in their lineage . There are strains which have been handed down through generations in this country ; among them are such great families as the Allen Roundheads , the Shelton Roundheads and the Clarets. // The breeding , rearing and fighting of gamecocks is as complicated as the racing of Thoroughbreds . Given a successful breeding program it is still a long way from the shell to the pit . Most game chickens are raised by hens , the fraternity feeling generally that a natural upbringing is best . Once the young males , called stags , begin to reach maturity all tarnation breaks loose . One day a man will have a yardful of stags which have lived peacefully together all their lives . The next morning he will find them fighting all over the place . At this point they are separated and from then on their only contact with other males will be in sparring bouts with boxing gloves , called muffs , or in deadly combat in the pit . // The most important phase in preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " period . Standing before a padded table , the feeder , as the conditioner is called , tosses the cock into the air to exercise his wing muscles and cross-walks him by pushing him back and forth across the table . This exercise is increased each day until the cock is tossed into the air as many as 50 times . Meanwhile a most elaborate feeding program is in force , including such items as chopped beef , cooked grain and chopped nuts . // If all goes well the cock arrives at the pit bursting with energy and crowing almost incessantly . He is matched against another cock within two ounces of his weight for a specified wager . A short time before the fight the handlers are told to heel up . // In this country the weapons with which cocks are heeled are gaffs  --  round , curving , steel needles which are fastened over the natural spurs by means of leathers and waxed string . In Puerto Rico they often use artificial spurs glued over the stubs of the natural ones . // At a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each holding his bird in the crook of his arm . The cocks are beaked , held close enough so they can peck and become aware of the presence of an adversary . // " Pit your cocks ! " shouts the referee . The handlers liberate their birds some 20 feet apart . The cocks meet six feet above the ground in a blur of wings and flashing steel . They come to earth and each gets a beakhold . They go into a long shuffle , legs pumping . Suddenly they become entangled and the referee shouts , " Handle ! " The handlers grab up their birds , nursing and resting them until the referee shouts , " Pit ! " Again handlers drop their birds and again the blur of wings and legs is so fast that a novice can not detect the telling blows . // But as the fight progresses the odds shouted out by the crowd change swiftly . Suddenly , in the midst of an exchange of blows , one bird drops dead . The victor stands beside his fallen foe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often , though , the victor hardly gets time to crow . The handlers pick up the winner and the loser and leave the pit . Bets are paid off and the crowd turns its eyes to a fresh pair of cocks being brought into the pit by another pair of handlers. // It has been this way , with minor variations , since before man began to record his history .
