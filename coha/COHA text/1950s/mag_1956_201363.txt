The process of delving into governmental iniquity under ex-Dictator Juan Pern came to an official end last week . At a special ceremony , Vice President Isaac Rojas praised the National Investigating Committee- and as tactfully as possible explained the government 's decision that the probe should now stop . A bit unhappy at the decision , Vice Admiral Leonardo McLean , the committee 's zealous chief , summed up its work : the staff of about 2,500 had arrested 1,045 suspects , sent 314 cases to the courts , spent only $70,000 in 27 weeks of investigations . Its records will now go to the Wealth Recovery Board ( TIME , Dec. 19 ) , which can mine them for leads useful in recovering further ill-gotten gains of the Peronistas , to add to the $35 million the board has already confiscated . <P> The committee withheld many of its findings ( which will become court evidence ) , and made only partial reports in most cases . But taken together , the reports told a murky story of top-to-bottom official corruption that got its cue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keepers ( one of whom appropriated the zoo 's imported canaries for his private collection ) . Some tidbits : Pern did his mother-in-law out of half of her bequest from the late Eva Pern , then with a medieval flourish had Evita 's brother , Juan Duarte , killed because he knew too much. * The dictator lavished $20 million on the clubs of his Union of High School Students , favoring teen-age girls with gold wrist watches and nylons before eventually choosing one 14-year-old , Nelly Rivas , as his special favorite ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) . Atomic " Scientist " Ronald Richter , who never split an atom , expertly diffused $3,700,000 of Argentina 's money in his fumbling attempts . Jorge Antonio , Mercedes-Benz tycoon and Pern crony , profiteered on so vast a scale that a subcommittee named exclusively to investigate him seriously recommended a fine of more than $1 billion . Defense Minister Jos Humberto Sosa Molina got from Pern 265 car import licenses , each worth more than $5,000 . Army Minister Franklin Lucero got 243 . <P> The smell of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But already there were hints of favoritism , and signs that continued prying might embarrass the new government . The decree ending investigations seemed to be a prudent recognition that bullying Peronista bullies could eventually get to be too much of a good thing . <P> <P> * A conclusion the investigators reached after exhuming and examining Duarte 's body . It was no great revelation to Argentines , who had long joked that Duarte 's last words before his " suicide " were : " Do n't shoot , boys- "
