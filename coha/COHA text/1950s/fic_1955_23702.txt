Madame Vishnak A Story by Morris Freedman Drawings by Torn Knoth 0 N ALMOST every occasion that our family had anything to do with Madame Vishnak something catastrophic happened , so I came , very pleasantly , to associate her with disaster . And though the wildest time during our acquaintance developed one night while she was a relatively innocent bystander , I like to think that the events of that night would not have arranged themselves just the way they did without her presence . Madame Vishnak , whose first name was Shulamith , was a European actress my mother had met and become friendly with in Crotona Park , near where we lived in the Bronx during the thirties . When Madame Vishnak moved away to Central Park West , my mother invited her without reservation to drop in on us any time she happened to be in our neighborhood . One day , several months later , a postcard in Russian script was delivered , and my mother with a broad smile announced that Madame Vishnak , who had to rehearse a play that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be having supper with us . My father was startled when he came home . " Tonight she has to come for supper ? " he said . My brother , four years younger than I , was in the midst of a mysterious respiratory affliCtion which caused him no fever but which required that he be shut in a room with a vaporizer going . My mother insisted that Madame Vishnak would in no way interfere with my brother 's treatment , and , becoming dramatic , declaimed that her dismal life needed a breath of air from the world of song and music . We waited for Madame Vishnak rather sullenly , and when she had n't come by eight o'clock , we sat down to supper . We had no telephone , and there was no way Madame Vishnak could have got in touch with us to explain her lateness . When we had an emergency , we used the telephone of the lady who lived upstairs , an old Italian woman named Mrs. Mangone , whom my mother always referred to as " the upstairs-ikke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great liking to my brother , and was quite concerned about his condition . She told my mother that if it was necessary to call the doctor suddenly we should rush up to her at once . She took down the doctor 's number and kept it near her phone so that if there were n't time even to run up the stairs , we could bang on the ceiling with a broomstick and yell , The doctor , the doctor . " It was a Friday night that we were waiting for Madame Vishnak , and soon " the nextdoor-ikke , " a little old Orthodox lady , Mrs. Levy , knocked on our door , opened it , and called for me to come close the jets on her stove . In several hours , she would call for me again to turn out the ceiling lights so that she could go to sleep . When I came back , munching the cookie I always got for my chore , the garbage bell rang , and I placed the can in the dumb-waiter . I was careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had toppled into the face of Mrs. Cohen , ' ' the downstairs-ikke , " when she opened her door . Mrs. Cohen had carried on a feud with my mother ever since , convinced that my mother had put the can in its precarious spot deliberately . She sent my mother envelopes every so often filled with dust curlicues , which she claimed had come into her windows from my mother 's mop shaking . Once she waved her finger under my mother 's nose , and shouted , " Wait till Mrs. Mangone moves out , and I become your upstairs-ikke . You 'll be sorry . " It had got dark outside , My father was reading the Forward , and my mother was moving around , putting things in place against the possibility that Madame Vishnak might really drop in so late . She stopped to dust the brass samovar she had recently got from a woman around the corner who had thrown it out saying it was an old-fashioned way of making tea . My mother shook her head a little sadly , and 1 realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new possession to Madame Vishnak . I joined my brother , who did n't seem to mind being cooped up . Propped on an elbow , he was reading a Rover Boys book . Next to his bed was a small table on which were a lamp and a vaporizer . I passed in front of the lamp and noticed that a huge shadow was cast on the dirty white window shade . We amused ourselves a while making shadows on the shade , and then , finding the heat uncomfortable , I went out . 1V1 ADA ME Vishnak came around half- past nine . She was furious . She swept past me when I opened the door for her , and down our long bowling alley of a hall . " New York police , " she announced to my mother after they had touched cheeks , " are wild barbarians . I ask directions here , and a red-faced man makes fun of my speech . What 's the joke to talk funny ? Every time I ask him the address , he answers me so I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to get here . " I wondered vaguely whether it had n't been the policeman who had trouble making out Madame Vishnak 's rich European accent . My mother calmed her and happily asked my father to light the samovar . Madame Vishnak paused to admire it , and then we sat down at the round dining-room table . My father did n't if he had n't begun mother 1 am sure make tea on the things baffled him . We once moved into an apartment that had a swinging door . The absence of a doorknob puzzled him , but rather than try to put one on , he resignedly placed a screwdriver on a table near the door which we used to pry it open . Only after my brother pushed the door several times from both directions , delighted with his discovery , did my father get the idea of the knobless door . He was now distastefully tinkering with the little key attached to the fuel barrel of the samovar , and standing off at a good distance while thrusting lighted matches at it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue , a busy main thoroughfare with streetcars and lines of stores . Next to it was a furrier 's on one side , and a dairy market on the other . Our apartment was in the back of the house , one flight up , and we missed a good deal of the steady noise in front . But as we sat at the table , listening to Madame Vishnak describe , with good-humored and easy mimicry , the people she had met that day , I became aware of shouts and scurrying in the back yard , and then 1 heard what sounded like a shot . My mother was too absorbed in Madame Vishnak , and my father in getting the samovar to work , to respond to these sounds . I went to the window of my parents ' bedroom , which had no doors and was off the dining-room where we were talking , raised the shade , looked into the yard , and saw nothing . I lowered the shade and returned to the table . In a few minutes , there was a furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened it , and two burly men , one in a policeman 's uniform , shoved past me .. Each had a flashlight in one hand and a revolver in the other . " Do n't anybody move , " the one in uniform shouted . " Where are they ? " He was red-faced and spoke with an Irish brogue . " Lady downstairs says signals been coming from here . " They lunged into my parents ' bedroom and flopped on the floor to look under the beds , muttering that we had better not he hiding anyone . Finding no one under the beds , they stood up to look around for other likely hiding places . My brother 's room opened off the dining-room , and though the door was shut , you could hear him moving around inside . He had obviously got out of bed to see what was going on . The two policemen looked at each other , then approached the door cautiously . " Cossacks ! " Madame Vishnak screamed at them , pounding the table , and rising . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us , stupefied . " Cossacks , " she screamed again . " All of you alike . Why do you speak so no human can understand you ? " It was the brogue , I realized , that was bothering her , and that had undoubtedly caused her earlier difficulty with a policeman . " What do you want with people ? There 's a sick child in that room . Do n't go near it . " My father , who had paused only momentarily in his absorbed fumbling with the samovar , must have brought a match close enough to the fuel , and a foot-high flame suddenly shot up . " Fire ! " my mother shouted , " Firer ' and dashed for the kitchen . A T THIS point , the shade I had raised and lowered a few minutes earlier shot up to the ceiling with a violent clatter . Both policemen fell to the floor , their guns aimed at the blank window . Simultaneously , my brother opened his door , looked out with a guilty smile , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , and announced , " 1 have to go to the bathroom very badly . " He looked first at us around the table , and then into the faces of the two kneeling policemen . He kept his face screwed into his false , ingratiating smile as he walked through the room and into the hall . My mother ran into the room with a bowl of water which sloshed over the sides . Luckily , she hesitated as she aimed it , for my father had managed to turn the flame down , and she just remained there , poised , waiting for another surge of the fire . About this time , the upstairs-ikke , hearing the commotion , must have decided that we were in a crisis with my brother and telephoned the doctor . As my brother disappeared into the hall , the nextdoor-ikke padded into the dining-room wearing a bathrobe over her nightgown , and a nightcap . She nodded pleasantly to the policemen , who by this time had got to their feet , and turned to me . " Time to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood up , and Mrs. Cohen , the downstairsikke , a squat barrel of a woman , hurtled into the room . She skidded violently on the wet floor , but recovered at once . " Well , " she shouted , glancing at the floor , " did you find them ? I always knew they were thieves and wretches up here . Did you find them ? Giving signals in the windows , hiding thieves . Arrest them all . " She swept her arm around the room , but paused when she saw Mrs. Levy , whom she respected for her Orthodoxy . " Hello , Mrs. Levy , what are you doing here ? " she asked slowly , her arm arrested in mid air . " I mean , " she stumbled , realizing that after all Mrs. Levy did n't have to answer to her , " I mean before the Sabbath ? " " Lights , " Mrs. Levy said . " Come , Moishele . " I followed the tiny figure down the long hail . At the door , I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block away . He was a recent resident in the neighborhood , a refugee from Europe , and was a dedicated and accommodating man . He was panting and must have run the entire distance . I moved aside to let him hurry by . In a moment , I was done with my work in Mrs. Levy 's apartment . Near our door was Mrs. Mangone . " How is the little boy ? " she asked in the hushed tone one uses for the dead . " Fine , " I said and nibbled at Mrs. Levy 's second cookie , " wo n't you come in ? " " No thanks , I 'll wait here , " she said , and sat down on the steps in the hall . Mrs. Cohen came prancing out , head down , and elbowed me as she passed . Inside , Dr. Seweletski was in a frenzy . He had rushed for my brother 's room without pausing . Discovering the empty bed , he emerged into the dining-room and looked around to see it filled with strangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the result of Mrs. Mangone 's frantic call , that my brother had been taken away in an ambulance . " Where did he go ? What hospital ? That boy needs special care , no oxygen , injections , it 's only an attack , " he spluttered , turning first to the two strange men , then to the gathering at the table . He stopped and gave Madame Vishnak a close look , leaning forward and peering intently through his thick-lensed glasses . Whatever he wanted to say to her just then , he was diverted by the return of my brother from the bathroom . " Hello , Doc , " he called cheerily , walked into his room , and closed the door . In a second the door opened , and his face appeared . " Did you want to see me , Doc ? " he asked . The plain-clothes-man , whose head had been swinging hypnotically from side to side as he took in the procession , remembered suddenly why he was there . " What I want to know is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just about got the guy who broke into the fur place , when he runs into the yard and disappears . And there 's this window , somewhere around here , showing all different shapes , one after another . Lady downstairs says signals . Where 'd she go anyhow ? " I remembered the shapes my brother and I were throwing on the shade and asked the policemen whether that was what might have been seen . We went into my brother 's room , my brother jumping away from the door and into bed , For the first time , there was no smile on his face . He pulled the covers up to his neck . " I really had to go to the bathroom , " he told us . " That 's all right , son , " one of the men said . I showed them how my brother and I had made shadow figures . Then they looked under his bed and poked into a closet . " I guess that 's it , " one finally said . W H E N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry , folks " and managed weak smiles . Madame Vishnak , whO was talking graciously with the doctor , changed her expression fiercely , and raised her fist and shook it at the two policemen . " Cossacks , " she announced . They grinned sheepishly , said nothing , and trekked through the hallway . I followed them and went outside for a moment to assure Mrs. Mangone , who was standing now with a look of fright as she saw the two men leave , that my brother was really all right . She looked dubious , but when T asked her to come in and see for herself , she merely sighed and started upstairs . " Call me any time , " she said . " Remember . Or bang on the floor . " Back in the dining-room again , I found Dr. Seweletski and Madame Vishnak in a spirited conversation about the Viennese theater . Madame Vishnak explained to me that the doctor had seen her once on the stage in Vienna . " One of the great actresses in Europe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift Madame Vishnak 's hand and bow to kiss it . But he did n't ; he just stood there with a silly look , " To tell the truth , " Madame Vishnak said to me , " he saw me in only a very minor part , a servant girl , but he remembered me and recognized me . " ' I he tea was finally ready , and the doctor joined us . After checking my brother by laying his hand on the boy 's forehead and exchanging grins , the doctor offered to accompany Madame Vishnak to the subway . " You know , " she said to me at the door , " such excitement you never find in the theater or anywhere like it , only where lots of people live together , like here in small apartment houses . I hope your brother is better soon . " te ?
