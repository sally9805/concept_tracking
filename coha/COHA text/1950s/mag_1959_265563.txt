Street of Shame ( Daiei ; Harrison ) , the last picture completed by the late Kenji ( Ugetsu ) Mizoguchi , perhaps the most gifted of recent Japanese moviemakers , is a Dickensian diatribe against prostitution . At the time the movie was released , Japan had some 500,000 " flowery-willowy " girls , and the picture is said to have swayed millions to support the stop-prostitution bill that was passed in 1956 . In the U.S. , where prostitution has seldom been seriously discussed on the screen , audiences will no doubt be stunned by the film 's unblinking realism . But they will probably not be startled by the scriptwriter 's discovery that every whore has a heart of gold . <P> The film investigates the lives of six prostitutes who work in " Dreamland , " a better-class brothel in Tokyo 's notorious Yoshiwara district , and for the most part , the acting is excellent . Machiko Kyo is particularly good . She slips so naturally into lace undies and Americanized manners that she is hard to recognize as the stilted medieval heroine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems repetitive and interminable , so indeed must the life of a prostitute . <P> The Rabbit Trap ( Canon ; United Artists ) . Once upon a time there was a company man ( Ernest Borgnine ) . He worked as a draftsman for a construction outfit , and the fellows all called him " Steady Eddie " because he was never late , never sick , never idle , never got a raise . One year the boss ( David Brian ) got bighearted and let him take a two-week vacation with pay . So Eddie piled the wife and kid in his ' 53 Chevy and headed for a place called Deep Springs , where there were some nice cabins , not too expensive . But after a couple of days , the boss rang up and told him he would have to come back right away . The missus was good and sore and the boy was heartbroken , but Eddie went . " I do n't have a college education , " was the way he figured it . " I got to be dependable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box trap he and his dad had set in the woods at Deep Springs . What if a rabbit got caught in it ? Nobody would let him out and he would starve to death . The boy was so sick about the rabbit that Eddie realized he would lose his son 's respect , not to mention his own self-respect , if he did not go back and let it out . But the boss was in such a flap about the job that Eddie was afraid to take the day off and make the trip . In the end Eddie had to make the hard old choice between position and principle , between making a living and making a life . And so at last the rabbit got out of the trap . <P> The Rabbit Trap was apparently intended as a sleeper , but seems likely to wind up as what the exhibitors call a caboose-the back end of a double bill . In a way , it 's a pity . As a social prescription , the story proposes a too simple cure for conformism , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , a useful moral : not all rabbits have long ears .
