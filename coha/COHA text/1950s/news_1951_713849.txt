Ives Sees Great Opportunity Asserting that the American people were " fed up " with the extravagance and inefficiency of the national administration , Senator Ives declared that the Repubican party had a great opportunity to elect a President and Congress in 1952 . He continued : " Five percenters and deep freezers and Harry Vaughan ; mink coats and the R. F. C. scandals ; red herrings and Alger Hiss and Dean Acheson ; the President 's inexcusably abominable treatment of General ? these are symbolic of an administration which has lost the confidence of the American people . They are evidences of Pendergastism saturating Washington . " As taxpayers , the American people are demanding a dollar 's return for every dollar spent . They are demanding that nondefense expenditures be cut to the bone and that every governmental service that is not truly essential to the welfare of the country be eliminated . They are demanding that there be frugality in defense expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the justifiable requirements of our preparedness program will permit . "
