txt President Eisenhower served notice on opponents of his defense modernization plan today that " there-can be no compromise on  --  or retreat from  --  the essentials of this legislation . " Disturbed at published reports that Neil H. , Secretary of Defense , had prepared a wellordered retreat from the President 's position , General Eisenhower telephoned the Cabinet official . Then he dictated a blunt statement to James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary . Mr. joined in denying that his testimony to the House Armed Services Committee yesterday represented a retreat from the President 's plan . He said , however , that " we are not wedded to language if there is substitute language which will be equally successful in achieving the stated goals of the President . " Drafted by Eisenhower Mr. Hagerty said that the President 's statement had , for the most part ; ? been written by General Eisenhower himself . It said : " This morning the President talked by telephone with the Secretary of Defense . The subject was the Defense Reorganization Bill and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compromise the objectives sought in the Defense Reorganization Bill which the President personally sent to the Congress .. " While the Secretary of Defense properly has not insisted on rigid adherence to words and phraseology , he has confirmed to the President that no changes in the meaning of any feature of the modernization program has been implied by any testimony of his . " Both the President and the Secretary are agreed that there can be no compromises on  --  or retreat from  --  the essentials of this legislation . " Apparently what first prompt- ed the President 's call to Secretary was a headline over an Associated Press slice ' in The Augusta Chronicle clef the defense chiefs testimony before House committee . It read : " Military Merger Is Shunted Aside by Defense Chief . " The paper is the first available to the President here . A Washington dispatch to The New York Times reported yesterday that the Administration 's promised fight for Pentagon reorganization had turned into a well-ordered retreat . The article said that Mr. had announced that " he was agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance of what he has been telling the committee all week that he wants . " Mr. Hagerty said in answer to questions that the President had telephoned Mr. from his cottage at the Augusta National Golf Club . " The President was disturbed about reports that we received this morning implying a position by the Secretary that the President was quite sure was not correct and called to confirm his beliefs and found that the implications were not correct , " Mr. Hagerty eiglained to reporters . During the half hour 's telephone conversation , according to the press secretary , the President was acquainted with the statement that the Defense Secretary proposed to issue . 's Statement This , too , was read by Mr. Hagerty during his noon meeting with reporters . Mr. 's statement was as follows : " I have been asked whether my testimony before the House Armed Services Committee this week represents a retreat from the recommendations contained in the President 's proposal for reorganizing the Defense Department and a compromise in the objectives sought by that recommendation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat in our effort to achieve through adoption of the President 's proposals a modernized defense establishment capable of meeting the necessities of our times . " I did make this statement to the committee : " ' I do n't think there is any reason to say that there is only one way to express the legislation that Is needed in order to accomplish the results that are needed ' and I readily con-1 firm it . " We are not wedded to language if there is substitute language which will be equally successful in achieving the stated goals of the President . I am confident that the committee understands my position . " ' The House Armed Services Committee began a major rewriting of the military reorganization bill after Secretary 's testimony . As outlined by General Eisenhower , the defense reorganization plan would grant the Secretary of Defense enlarged and more direct authority over strategic planning and operations . It would also give him greater discretionary power in the use of defense appropriations and reduce the separate service secretaries to administrative officials and the Joint Chiefs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been directed particularly to the proposed authority to transfer funds from one major category to another and to the downgrading of the service secretaries . ? Objections also have been raised that the bill would make possible the abolition of the separate armed services and their merger into a single operating force . But this . the President has vigorously denied to be a part of his program . The President made a conciliatory gesture today toward Congress . He promised to approve all but some $146,000,000 of the $1,704,028,300 water resources authorization bill that he vetoed ten days ago . 28 Projects Opposed General Eisenhower told Congress that he was ready to approve immediately an authorization of $1,353,172,000 for rivers and harbors . He vetoed legislation because it included twenty-eight objectionable projects costing $350,000,000 . In a letter to Senator William F. Knowland and Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr .. minority leaders , the President also promised approval of projects involving $204,000,000 of the $350,000,000 originally objected to if modified to conform to various Federal standards . The letters to the Congressional leaders were dispatched this morning while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of golf followed a light luncheon .
