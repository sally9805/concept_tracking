txt MAKING LOOSE COVERS Loose covers should not be considered merely as a protection for delicate and expensive fabrics or a means of hiding worn or faded upholstery , but as one way of altering the appearance of a room . For example , a set of loose covers in warm and stimulating colours can be used during the dark winter days on chairs upholstered in light tones more suitable for the summer . Alternatively , rooms can be toned down and entirely changed by judicious alterations in the colouring of the curtains . There are a number of materials which are suitable for loose covers , these include cretonnes , printed linens , and glazed and semi-glazed chintzes . Plain materials such as casement cloth and repps are useful as contrasts to patterned carpets and walls . In every case the material used for loose covers should be strong , and unless plain fabrics are of good quality they will show creases . Considerable care is needed when measuring up for loose covers ; they should be a good fit , but allowance must be made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others , and the possible amount of shrinkage should be ascertained before the material is made up . Loose covers for chairs and settees are usually made with " tuckaways " down the sides and back of the seat to help the cover to keep in position . The visible seams and joins are best finished with piping ; this may be done with the same material or with a contrast , or in the case of a figured fabric , with a plain colour to tone . About 9 in. should be added to measurements for tuckaways on the inside back , the seat and the inside arms . If a frill is used , take the total measurement of the chair all round and add 5o per cent . for fullness . Rufflette curtain pocket tape should be sewn at the bottom edge of the frill so that it can be pulled up as tight as the top . This is a simple method of keeping the cover neat and tidy at the bottom of the chair . 20 2I FABRICS FOR THE HOME Colour , texture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of suitable fabrics for use in the home as well as for personal clothing . The greater proportion of fabrics in ordinary use are manufactured by machinery and are produced in great quantities and it is often difficult to make a selection . The most successful fabrics are those in which the yarns , weave , design , colour and finish are harmoniously combined to produce a fabric suitable in all respects for its purpose . In particular , the closeness of the weave must be in keeping with the object to be served . Cotton fibres consist of the hairs which are attached to the seed pods of the cotton plant and cotton is one of the cheapest fabrics . It is manufactured up into a variety of forms ; many fabrics once made of linen are now made of cotton ; these include nainsooks , cambrics , lawns , sheetings and shirtings . Cotton is also blended with wool in the manufacture of many household fabrics . Linen fabrics are woven from yarns spun from the bast fibres obtained from the flax plant . Linen was probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known to be at least 6,000 years old . Apart from the value of linen as one of the most durable of fabrics , and its use for table cloths , dress material , etc. , linen fabrics are excellent for use as upholstery and the new finishing processes have rendered them admirable for cushions , curtains , etc . Wool , like linen , has been used for thousands of years . The quality of the fleeces used in its manufacture vary considerably . Wool is an exceedingly valuable member of the textile family , as it possesses several important qualities that are not equalled by any of the other fibres . Wool is naturally crease-resisting owing to its inherent elasticity . It has the property of absorbing twice as much moisture as cotton without feeling damp . Silk is unique in that it does not require to be spun 22 z3 24 like other natural fibres . It is expensive because the crop is very limited compared with other fibres such as cotton , flax and wool . Owing to its properties of absorbing moisture without a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an ideal fabric for wear next the skin . Rayon is the first machine-made fibre and is made by converting cellulose , obtained from wood pulp , into filaments by a lengthy series of chemical and mechanical processes . The greatest weaknesses of rayon are its loss of strength when wet and its small elasticity . Rayon yarns do not hold dirt as tenaciously as most other fibres , and this is helpful in laundering , but considerable care is required in handling wet fabric . The principal furnishing fabrics are Bedford Cord , which is characterised by more or less rounded and well defined cords running lengthwise of the fabric . Brocade , formerly used to denote rich silk fabrics , is now applied mainly to ordinary fabrics . Casement cloth is a term covering many lightweight furnishing fabrics . It is most commonly applied to a plain weave texture somewhat heavier than an average quality of plain cotton , but not so tightly woven so that it drapes more gracefully . Fabrics made half-cotton and half-rayon are becoming popular as casement cloths . Chintz is a glazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to wash it . Corduroy is a strong cloth with a weft pile surface . The weft is usually cotton , but in the best qualities is of wool . It is woven grey and piece dyed . Crash is a strong , coarse linen fabric made with inferior flax . Cretonne is a general term applied to an extensive range of cotton fabrics . Damasks are produced from the finest linen yarns , but are imitated in cotton . Moquette is usually a wool or ramie pile on a cotton ground , it may be plain or figured . Repps are reversible fabrics used for upholstery as well as curtains . Tapestry is now made on the power loom and produced in a variety of patterns . as FITTING CURTAIN HOOKS AND RAILS To be effective , curtains should run easily and drape gracefully , and this can only be done by using suitable fitments . With the aid of Rufflette brand tape and hooks , as illustrated on the next page , the housewife will have no difficulty in hanging the curtains . The majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail , the suspension between the rail and the curtains being effected by the use of a small runner wheel . When handling heavy curtains especially , and for all purposes where a cord-controlled curtain rail is required , the Rufflette fittings are ideal , the operation of the cords is simply yet ingeniously designed , and the fittings do not show when the curtains are drawn . Net curtains are sometimes hung on spring curtain wire , extending rods , wooden rods and brass rails , the latter , when flat is the neatest and most effective . This form of rail , also called the glass rail , can be used with and without gliders as indicated on the next page . By sewing Rufflette in. tape to the curtain heading , and looping the special pockets of the tape on to special gliders , the curtains can be moved to and fro at will , and at the same time keep their shape perfect and draping even . When measuring for curtain rails which are to overlap in the centre , allow 6 in. more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side beyond the window frame . For windows in a recess it is a good thing to have the curtains clear of the window sill . It is advisable to wipe curtain rails regularly with an oily rag , damp atmosphere is liable to corrode the metal . If the curtain rail can not be fixed direct to the wood-work of the window frame , it is usual to provide a suitable strip of wood about z in. by r in. and secure it to the wall with Rawlplugs. z6 // The popularity of lace net curtains is due to the fact that in day-time they screen the room from the outside without shutting out the light or the view from the room . Good lace curtains are also decorative . Four typical designs for curtain laces are shown on the opposite page , and these are still in demand for windows of pre-war style . The modern type of casement window usually calls for nets and brise of varying widths , which are either sold by the yard or made in complete units . Festoon curtains or blinds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also round windows , the festoon blind can be made easily by using Rufflette curtain tape at equal intervals from the top to the bottom of the blind , special curtain rings are inserted in the pocket tape to take the cords . Simplicity in handling curtains is assured by the use of Rufflette pocket tape ; it is available in widths of in. , 4 in. , i in. , i1 in. , and I in. ( twin pocket ) . The t in. is used for net size curtains only with a special hook . The pocket is not a hole or a loop , it is actually woven and does not shrink with washing or stretch with wear . The pockets are spaced every z in. and ensures evenlyspaced folds without the need for measuring . Two illustrations showing methods of making valances are shown at the bottom of the previous page . Box pleating is generally effective , but gathered valances look better if given three rows of gauging as indicated . With Rufflette tape , no difficulty will be found in making a valance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. wide and occur every 2 in. or 3 in. along the top ; they are ironed hard down on the heading tape and allowed to open out slightly ( but still stiffly ) towards the lower edge . For a box-pleated valance , three times the rod measurement should be allowed . z8 29 // Needle weaving is one of the most quickly worked and at the same time one of the most effective forms of simple embroidery . Actually it is a method of treating the warp threads when the weft has been withdrawn . Crash , linen , canvas , hessian and net are all suitable . All kinds of articles can be decorated with needle weaving ; the method allows of formal designs to be worked using coloured wools or mercerised cotton . For the purpose of decoration , it is a simple matter to design bright patterns in colour . In preparing a piece of material for needle weaving in closely woven material the width of the band should be marked out . The width of the pattern is cut between two threads , pull out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points at the required spot , taking care to cut between the two warp threads . The cut threads are withdrawn after the raw edges of the material have been buttonholed . The threads are now divided into groups by buttonholing or hemstitching . In weaving , use a blunt needle and a long thread ; although not essential it is convenient to use an em broidery frame to keep the threads taut . Simple patterns can be worked by passing the needle backwards and forwards over and under the threads . Designs for needle weaving can be worked out on squared paper , each square being used to represent a group of threads ; it is advisable to plan out patterns containing more than one colour in order to avoid mistakes . It is convenient to work from the centre of a pattern , and care should be taken to press the threads down so that the warp threads are hidden . The curtain illustrated looks most effective ; it is worked in mercerised thread in three colours to tone with the colour scheme of the room . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net with a z in. hem border and a small pattern either side as shown . 3I DECORATIVE STITCHES One of the simplest methods of decoration by stitches is the chain stitch as shown at Fig. i at the top of the next page . This stitch is capable of many variations , one of the most useful being the lazy-daisy , and it is used mainly to form small star-like flower shapes . It will be seen that the petals are formed by a long loop held in position by a small stitch as indicated at Fig. 2 . When the loops are complete as at Fig. 3 , they may be added to and made more decorative as shown at Fig. 4 . The above illustrations , from " rot Things for Girls to Do , " are only a few of many devoted to decorative needlework . Another typical illustration from the same book appears also on the next page and is one accompanying an article on Simple Embroidery Motifs . The flower motif at Fig. t is an adaption of the lazy-daisy stitch shown at Fig. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same stitch . The flower form at Fig. 3 is effective with a back stitch or some other form of line stitch . In the illustration at Fig. 4 , the leaves are in back stitch and the stem in crewel stitch . In Fig. 5 , the outline of the leaf is in crewel stitch and the veins in back stitch . Suggestions are given at Figs. 6 and 7 , for obtaining an effect of radiation in arranging a pattern . A spray containing leaves can be arranged as indicated at Fig. 6 , or the same effect of radiation can be gained by using the spiral . Although it is quite possible to obtain transfers for almost any kind of embroidery work , there is much more satisfaction to be obtained in working out an original pattern , and using creative ability in designing something containing originality of treatment . It is , of course , necessary to have some knowledge of the various stitches which can be used in decorative work in order that effective designs can be worked out . 32 // The kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , can be a model of compactness and yet contain all that is necessary for cooking as well as laundry work . The provision of an electric washing machine means a great saving of time and labour , and in selecting such equipment the inclusion of a mechanical ironer is worth while . The housewife who is contemplating the addition of a power washer to the kitchen equipment should take into account the ease of operation , the saving of time and energy , and the possibility of doing other things while the machine is at work . But the question of available space for an electric washer is an all important matter in the small kitchens usually to be found in modern houses and flats ; it is , therefore , essential that compactness must be considered . A new type of electrical aid to washing and ironing is illustrated on the next page and is admirably adapted for use in small kitchens . When not in use it can be lowered by means of the adjustable legs and may be placed under a table , the draining board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures only 2.31t- in. high , 211 in. wide and 24 in. deep . It is known as the Thor Stowa-way Kitchen laundry , and it operates from any wall socket and needs no special plumbing connections . Although the modern electric washer requires no mechanical attention and usually can be serviced if desired , it does need to be kept clean . After use , the machine should be rinsed in warm water and wiped dry . Being composed of enamelled metal , the work of cleaning is rendered quite easy . It may happen when hard water is used , that a scum deposit will be left ; this can be removed by a rub with a brush moistened with paraffin , afterwards rinsing with clean warm water and soap . Care should be taken that all water is drained off after use . 34 35 // The invention of the carpet sweeper followed by the vacuum cleaner has done away with the drudgery of hand sweeping , and the vacuum cleaner especially does the work most satisfactorily without raising dust . It is now no longer necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept . The carpet sweeper in the form of a small box on wheels , containing brushes which revolve as the box is pushed along , makes very little dust and quickly removes surface dust ; it is not so thorough in its action as the vacuum cleaner , which sucks up the dust . Vacuum cleaners may be either hand or power driven , the latter being the most satisfactory in general use and should be used if electric current is available . They cost surprisingly little to run and , if serviced from time to time , have a long life . In selecting a leaner , it is necessary to take into account the reliability of the manufacturer and the availability of service . A machine that can not be serviced locally is likely to cause trouble and expense . Most vacuum cleaners have various attachments such as upholstery brushes , floor brushes , polishers and even sprayers , all efficient and labour saving . Special dusting attachments and appliances are also available . A vacuum cleaner is not only labour saving and clean in use , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet than the hand brush . The life of a carpet cleaned regularly with a reliable vacuum cleaner is greatly increased and its appearance enhanced . It is advisable to empty the dust bag each time the cleaner is used . It is not a difficult job to remove the brushes for cleaning , but any necessary oiling or motor attention should be done by the service operator . It should be noted that vacuum cleaners are as useful for cleaning clothes , curtains and drapery as for upholstered furniture . // The pelmet is an English term synonymous with the American and French term " Lambrequin . " The modern pelmet is entirely flat and may be made of furnishing buckram or sail cloth . It can be of any shape or design which is in general harmony with the room . In designing a pelmet , an essential point to consider is that of its dimensions in proportion to the height of the room and of the window . Pelmets are not difficult to make , but they call for accuracy in cutting and neatness in execution . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is advisable to allow three-quarters of an inch more than the pattern all round and then cut the material to the buckram , turning in the edges and snipping the material where necessary . The design for the edges of a pelmet requires consideration ; there is no fixed rule but it is a good plan to follow the lines of the chair furniture in the room . The materials required to make a pelmet are velour , silk or other curtain material . Furnishing buckram , braid , tassels , motifs and Rufette curtain pocket tape . The illustrations on the next page show two quite simple edges at the top ; the trimming should follow the lines of the cut-out pattern . The diagonal design is particularly effective in a modern room and allows for contrasts in colour . The same applies in the case of the modern panelled design ; in this case there is opportunity for colour harmony . The more ornate design is capable of effective colour treatment . For a straight window the pelmet should project about 6 in. beyond each side and about 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , careful measurements are necessary . A represents the inside length , B the depth , C the length of the main window and D the length of the sides . The pelmet front will be approximately 6 in. in front of these measurements . 38 // Pelmets are fixed to a board or shelf which also carries the curtain rail . Usually the width of the shelf is 6 in. , and about 6 in. is allowed for projection beyond the window on each side . The shelf should have a strong support , particularly if heavy curtains are to be used ; iron brackets are usual . The suggestion at the top of the next page shows a pelmet shelf supported by plain angle brackets which are screwed to narrow blocks or strips of wood nailed to the wall on each side of the window frame . In the case of windows with a wide framing , the iron brackets can be attached directly to the framing . The use of plywood allows for more elaborate shapes to be made ; the plywood can be cut to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the shelf as indicated on the next page . In the case of square corners , suitable supports should be provided at the corners ; these should be cut from wood planed to triangular section and screwed to the shelf . Pelmet boards with rounded ends are no more difficult to make and fit . A suggestion is given at the bottom of the next page for a curved pelmet of plywood . The entire front , up to the beginning of the curves at the ends should be straight . The curved ends must be screwed to projecting blocks in front , and to the back supports carrying the iron angle brackets . The front blocks should be at least r in. square in section . If there should be any difficulty in bending the plywood , make a series of vertical saw-cut at intervals of r in. or so down to the first layer of the plywood ; these saw-cuts being at the back will not show . Pelmets for bay windows are made on similar lines , but the shelf must be made up with separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be joined at the top with strips of wood about 2 in. by i in. so that the underside is left clear for the curtain rails . 40 // Nowadays lampshades in all shapes and sizes can be inexpensively purchased , but it is not always an easy matter to obtain them in colourings or decorative treatment to suit particular requirements . As the materials for making lampshades are also easily procurable , special shapes and decorative effects can be obtained if they are made at home , not to mention the satisfaction that an original design will provide . The diagrams on the opposite page show the method of cutting out the shapes for four typical forms of shade . The shapes should be drawn out on squared paper in the first place ; the size of the squares will depend on the size of the finished shade , those in the diagrams being based on squares of i in . Many suitable materials are available , the most useful being vellum paper ; this is an imitation of real vellum , and is firm enough for use in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cream , red , green , pink and orange . Decoration can be carried out with water colour mixed with ox-gall . Parchment paper is also useful , but it should be used with a wire frame . Patterned paper , including wallpapers are also useful . Galvanised wire can be used for frames , and joins can be made with fine binding wire if they can not be secured with solder . It is usual to attach the shade to the wire frame by silk cord or fine leather thongs . A special thonging punch can be purchased , but suitable holes can be made with a saddler 's punch used with a hammer on a block of wood . Always draw lines for the thonging holes and mark off the spaces with a rule . The pleated shade can be made with either plain or patterned paper arranged in small pleats . In measuring the material , allow z in. extra beyond the wire frame and double the circumference . The holes for the cords should be punched about halfway across the width of the pleat and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl of flowers illustrated at the top of the next page is an example of table or window decoration made up entirely of everlasting flowers . It contains no more than four different kinds , but the great variety of colour including crimsons , yellows , pinks , purples and white with the delicate green of the stalks , give an effect of great beauty . Not only is decoration by means of everlasting flowers an economical way of providing colourful effects , but has the advantage of being available when fresh flowers are scarce . There is generally no difficulty in purchasing a good selection of suitable flowers from a florist , but the better plan is to grow them in the garden . As a guide to the most suitable varieties , the following list will provide a selection suitable for all purposes . The Helichry sum : these are the large double flowers shown in the top bowl . Acrolinium provides double rose and white . Rhodanthe is a daisy like flower , the Maculata is bright rose with a white centre , the Alba variety is white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be grown in ordinary garden soil . Statice , or sea lavender , is available in many beautiful pastel shades . Gypsophila is not classed as an everlasting flower , it dries well however , and is an admirable flower for use with all the flowers mentioned above . Another most effective method of utilising everlasting flowers is to combine them with pine cones , teasle heads and sprays of honesty . An example of effective decorative treatment is shown in the lower example . In this case , the pine cones and poppy heads have been painted with a blue bronze paint and white camomile flowers after being dried were dipped in yellow and pink aniline dyes . Filling is done with statice and dried moss , also dyed in several harmonious shades . 45 // Stool and chair seating in sea-grass is quite a simple craft . It is something that the housewife can do in spare time , but it also provides a most interesting and useful craft for either the older boys or girls . Sea-grass is a most popular seating material , far easier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made in lengths which obviate joining . It is obtainable in a number of colours , from natural to dyed , the latter being available in orange , scarlet , indigo , dark emerald and brown . It can also be obtained in a two coloured twist in natural and orange , natural and green and brown and orange , all pleasing combinations . Two out of a large number of different methods of weaving are shown on the previous page . For the average stool seat , from i lb. to i lb. is required according to the method of working . Stools can be obtained ready made in a large variety of shapes and sizes . They are made generally in birch or oak and may be finished with enamel or stained and polished without difficulty . The methods of beginning the seating and of continuing with a pattern are shown on page 49 . Before starting the actual weaving the sea-grass must be arranged in some convenient form for working . Ten yards is a convenient length and is best wound on a shuttle , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stout cardboard with a deep notch at each end . The first stage consists of tying a knot close to the end of the sea-grass and tacking it on the inside of the frame as shown at the bottom of page 49 . From this lefthand corner , bring the strand out under the frame , over the front rail and across the stool to the back rail . Pass it over and across the underneath of the stool to the starting point so that there is one strand on top and another underneath the frame . Keeping the strand tight , wind the sea-grass in the same way to make a total of three strands for a simple 47 weave , or in the case of two colours being used as shown on the next page , weave five strands . The next stage is to wrap the sea-grass once completely round the frame and then continue right across . The second set of strands are woven across from side to side and although the method of weaving is the same , the sea-grass is carried over one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this stage to thread a length of round wood as shown in the diagram just before the weaving is done . To join a new length , thread the new end through the twist of the old about z in. away from the end , and again i in. further along . Thread the old end through the twist of the new strand and the join will be secure ; joins should always be on the underside of the frame . When the weaving is completed , the end is secured by tying it to one of the strands on the underside . The pattern shown at the top of page 46 is started by a length of sea-grass to the right-hand back corner inside , carry it over on top to the back , up and round the rail close to the corner . Pass the strand across to the other side at the back , over the left rail and then up and around the back rail . The next stage is to carry it down across the open frame to the front left-hand corner over the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right-hand corner when it is carried over and is brought up over the front rail and carried across to the starting point . The above method completes the first stage and the order is now followed with a second and third round and repeated until the seat is completely filled . If the seat is square , the weaving will meet in the centre as indicated , but with an oblong seat or stool , the remaining space should be filled in by working only from front to back . Other materials for seating , such as glossy and enamelled cane can be used similarly . 48 . // Six stages in recaxung are shown opposite . First remove the old cane , and punch out the holes from underneath . Wash the framework with warm water and a hard brush . Begin by inserting a length of No. z cane in the centre hole at the back . Wedge it firmly with a peg , bring the cane to the correct hole in the front and peg it down . The cane is brought up through the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back and pegged down . Continue on both sides until the whole of the seat is covered with parallel rows . With seats narrower at the back , place the cane in appropriate holes . When a join is needed bring the end up through the next hole and leave it projecting . Begin a new cane in the same way . In stage two , the same process is followed , but the canes are across and on the top of the first lot . The third stage is a repetition of the first stage with the canes on top of the second layer . Actual weaving begins with the fourth stage , in which the cane is carried from side to side , each strand in turn being threaded over the canes of the third stage and under those of the first stage . In the fifth stage No. 3 cane is used and it is threaded diagonally over two and under two . The sixth stage consists of diagonal threading over three and under three . Finish by driving small pegs in every alternate hole to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provide four lengths of beading cane and some fine cane for securing it in position . Insert one end of a length of beading cane at a corner and bring it over to the next corner . Secure the length by threading the fine cane through the holes left unpegged , loop it over the beading cane and continue on all sides . Finish with a peg at the four corners to keep the beading in position . // Although household duties usually take up a considerable portion of the day , every housewife should endeavour to find time for practising some useful or decorative craft . Gardening is ideal for the spring and summer , but during the long winter evenings and on days when outdoor exercise is impossible , some form of light and interesting occupation will provide a pleasing contrast to the ordinary daily duties . There are many useful little crafts eminently suitable for the housewife which do not entail much in the way of equipment or expense , quite apart from such decorative and useful work as may be carried out with the needle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerate more than a few of the most suitable of the crafts or to give detailed instructions , but as many inexpensive books are available , giving full instructions as to methods and materials , little difficulty will be found in making a beginning . Included in the more popular of the crafts are , weaving , leatherwork , basketry , rug making , and pewter modelling . Equally suitable , are fabric printing , soft-toy making , lacquer work , gesso work , decorative dyeing , jewellery , lace making and woodcarving . Leatherwork calls for little in the way of appliances ; there is considerable choice in material and much in the way of useful work , either for household or personal use . Basketry includes the use of cane and raffia and offers scope for highly decorative as well as simple work . Pewter modelling is an inexpensive and delightful craft and with those mentioned above are opportunities for making acceptable gifts of greater value than most people can afford to buy . Of the others mentioned , jewellery work offers opportunity for personal adornment and scope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a joy to the children . fz THE CARE OF HOUSEHOLD BRUSHES The cleaning of household brushes , including those used for the toilet , should be considered as an important household duty . Brushes , for whatever purpose they are required , should be of the best quality , cheap brushes are rarely economical , but a good quality brush , frequently washed , usually has a long life . Brushes should be stored when not in use so that the bristles can not be damaged , generally with the bristles uppermost . Many hair brushes are made with highly decorative backs and are intended to be placed on the dressing table with the backs uppermost . With those having fairly ' stiff fibres it does not matter if the fibres are downwards , but with soft brushes , it is advisable to keep them in a drawer , protected from dust . The household sweeping brushes should be suspended on pegs in a special brush cupboard if possible ; if inconvenient to stand them upright or have the bristles on top , they should be suspended bristles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hair brushes and others used for the toilet should be washed from time to time in warm water with soap flakes and a little ammonia . First remove hair and fluff with a comb and wash them in a lather . Rinse thoroughly in warm water , shake to remove surplus moisture and place in a draughty position to dry . Household brushes should also be washed in warm water and soap flakes . Soda or strong soaps should not be used . The lather should be rubbed thoroughly into the bristles and when clean the brush should be rinsed in warm water . Brushes used for painting or varnishing should be cleaned with turpentine . Those used for cellulose paint must be cleaned in the solvent advised . or with amyl acetate . After cleaning with turps. , etc. , the brush should be washed with soap and water , rinsed and then dried . When dry , paint brushes should be wrapped in paper . // Two typical Japanese gardens are illustrated on the next page . They are obtainable in various sizes and are furnished with dwarfed trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , birds , animals and figures , at a reasonable figure , and with care will last for years . When purchasing ready-made Japanese gardens , go to a reputable firm . Miniature gardens can be made quite easily and inexpensively with materials to be found in the countryside or purchased at the florists and oriental stores . They should be built in an earthenware baking dish to any convenient size , one measuring i z in. by 7 in. is suitable for a start . Collect the materials first ? sandstone and granite chips will provide rock material , the shell gravel used for bird cages will do for paths . Suitable foliage can be supplied from mosses , tufts of grass , cactus of various kinds , s edling oaks and beeches from the woods or hillside , sprigs of heather and tiny ferns . Pagodas , bridges and small buildings are easily made , but these can be purchased from the stores as well as suitable birds and figures . Lakes can be formed by saucers or glass dishes : much ingenuity can be expended in making up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants should be gathered with the original soil covering the roots and planted in well sifted soil , which should more or less fill the dish . Press the soil firmly , arrange the buildings , etc. , and then finish with moss where desired . Genuine stunted trees are expensive , due to the care required in their cultivation . As the dish used for the garden will not allow of drainage , it is a good plan to line the bottom with sharp gravel or stone chips before filling with soil . The latter should be kept moist but not really wet , and from time to time all the growing foliage should be sprayed , preferably with rain water . 54 BULBS . // The cultivation of bulbs provides for flowers at a time when cut flowers are difficult to obtain . The hyacinth with its variety in colouring is always popular ; daffodils , narcissus and tulips are quite as easily grown , and the begonia , with its brilliant colouring , should not be overlooked . For indoor cultivation it is advisable to purchase bulbs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowls . Suitable bowls are inexpensive and are available in a number of shapes and sizes . Generally , in a bowl measuring about 7 in. in diameter and 3 in. deep , it is possible to grow three hyacinths or four or five daffodils or tulips . The prepared fibre , which should contain a small amount of charcoal , should be carefully powdered and placed in a large bowl or clean pail . Add water , preferably rain water , to make the fibre thoroughly wet and then line each bowl about halfway up . Select the bulbs carefully and place in position , not too near the edge of the bowl and well separated . Fill up the bowl with the wet fibre but do not quite cover the tops of the bulbs . The bowls are now placed in a cool airy place ; there is no need to keep them entirely in the dark , but they should be left alone until the growth begins , when they can be brought gradually in the full light and by degrees into more warmth . The appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the bulbs . As soon as the growth is a few inches high , sprinkle some fine grass seed on the fibre and press it lightly ; in a short time the grass will sprout and by the time the bulbs are in flower the grass will be z in. or 3 in. high and will hide the bulb entirely . Bulbs require little moisture until they are well grown , and then should be watered regularly . As soon as the bulbs have flowered , they should be taken out and either planted in the garden or stored . 5 7 A BULB BASKET The usual method of growing bulbs is to use an earthenware bowl , but bulbs can be grown in almost any kind of utensil . Old coal scuttles , pans of all kinds , basins or vegetable dishes , in fact , anything large enough to hold the necessary fibre in which the bulb should be embedded . The children should be encouraged to grow bulbs for their own rooms , and , if suitable bowls are not available , baskets can be made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passable state of repair and when suitably lined will grow bulbs admirably . The bulb basket shown on the next page is one of many useful jobs for the boy or girl who likes using a saw , hammer and nails . It is a page from " 101 Things for Little Folks to Do . " Begin with a piece of wood - in. thick and about 3+ in. square , and cut off the corners so that they are all equal . Now get some lengths of round wood and saw them to a length of 3 in . Split the lengths down the centre and nail them on the sides of the wood , leaving z in. projecting from the bottom . The next thing is to find a pliable twig to bend into a ring so that it can be nailed to the top of the uprights as shown in the middle drawing . Be very careful to avoid splitting the upright pieces when nailing . Use fine nails and leave them projecting a little way as shown . The outside has to be closely wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Michaelmas daisies are in the garden , or easily procured , use the stalks after soaking them . Last of all , wrap some fine wire round the nails and behind the feet as shown in the bottom diagram , and then hammer the top nails down close to the band . The fibres and wood can be coated with varnish if it is handy . // Dwellers in flats and apartments are often denied the pleasures of cultivating flowers in the open ground , and are compelled to rely on the small spaces provided by the window sill . With care and attention , window boxes can be used to provide flowers from seed and also to hold flowers in pots . The ideal window box is one specially made from wood about i in. thick , to fit the exact space available , but it is quite possible to join a number of small boxes together and make a satisfactory garden . Usually the space available does not exceed 9 in. and in this case only comparatively narrow boxes are suitable ; they should be as deep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to give more than a rough guide to the arrangement of the boxes . First the slope of the sill must be considered ; this can be overcome by nailing the boxes to a stout board to rest on the front of the sill . If the latter should be narrow , the boxes should be supported underneath with a suitable strip of wood . One of the essentials in the construction of a window box is to provide for drainage . In some cases it may be necessary to prevent water draining from the box from running down the wall ; in this case it will be necessary to fit a zinc tray on the sill , but in every box holes should be bored in the bottom . For holding flower-pots only , the bottom of the boxes should be covered with a layer of ashes ; in boxes to be filled with soil , the bottom layer should be composed of broken pieces of old flower pots . If the separate boxes are held together in front with a board , the latter may be relieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Before being used , all the wood should be given at least two coats of paint . A simple method of attaching the window box is to use angle brackets ; these are easily screwed to the top of each end box and to the window frame . 6o WINDOW GARDENING .

As a rule it is unnecessary to have more than one deep shelf , but it is convenient to have a number of narrow shelves on which single rows of articles may be arranged . The illustration on the next page shows a typical cupboard or pantry fitted with a number of extra shelves easily made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given for the provision of hooks on the inside of the door as well as a wire letter cage for use in storing vegetables , etc . The plywood strips on the top shelf need not be more than 3 in. or 4 in. wide ; they are supported on uprights cut from the same material as the shelves to which they are nailed . Unless heavy articles are placed on the top of these shelves , there is no need to nail on a back piece , but if necessary a strip of the same material nailed to the back will make the shelves perfectly rigid . Narrow shelves , made of 3 in. by 2 in. wood , can be attached to the wall in any required position by means of brass mirror or glass plates ; the latter are screwed to the back of the shelves and attached to the wall with fairly stout wire nails . These shelves should be used only for light articles . Light packing cases or similar boxes can be arranged at the back of the deep shelf . A simple method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slab . Extra shelves underneath the deep shelf or slab should be made from boards about 4 in. thick , and rested on supports of z in. by i in. wood attached to the wall with stout cut nails .

As a rule it will be necessary to fit strips between the door stiles to prevent the screws being driven through the panel . 6z XTRA SHELVES MADE FROM PLYWO OD STRIPS 1 , I l l % SRAS I 's , NAIL : RATts .

The refrigerator forms the ideal larder , it is dustproof , fly-proof , heat-proof and damp-proof . It keeps perishable food fresh and wholesome , milk and cream always fresh and it prevents household waste . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during recent years has proved their value as a necessary article of household equipment . Although the initial cost of a refrigerator is somewhat high , special terms of purchase are available . The refrigerator should be considered as a means towards obtaining wholesome and uncontaminated food . The gas refrigerator illustrated on the next page is most economical to run , it requires just a tiny gas flame , there are no moving parts and , therefore , permanent silence and no radio interference . To obtain the best results from a mechanical refrigerator , the shelves and the interior should be kept perfectly clean . The contents should be checked daily and spills wiped up . Once a week the interior should be wiped clean , especially the shelves . The ice trays should be emptied and refilled regularly . The vegetable and salad container should be attended to frequently to prevent excessive moisture and the maker 's instructions regarding de-frosting should not be neglected . This should be done about every fortnight ; if left too long without de-frosting , the cooling unit becomes so heavily coated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run refrigerators , it is necessary to oil the bearings of the motor periodically ; instructions are provided by the makers and should be carefully noted . Actually , there is no difference between the two types so far as interior cleaning is concerned , they are both effective in use . 64 AN ELECTROLUX GAS REFRIGERATOR . 65 EASILY MADE SHELVES FOR THE KITCHEN . // With the possibilities that exist for obtaining ready planed wood to almost any width and thickness , the housewife who can use a saw , a hammer and screwdriver should have little difficulty in making shelves . A suggestion is given on the previous page for an easily made set of shelves to carry plates , dishes , cups and saucers , and jugs . The example shown was made to fit in a narrow space between two doors in a small kitchen so that the small dresser could be used for the storage of other articles of daily use . In the example given , the wood used was finished to 4 in. wide and s in. thick , the two upright sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up the width to fit the available space of 2 ft. ro in . The front lower corners of the upright pieces were rounded by sawing off the corner and then the wood was smoothed on the sawn edges with a file . The position of the shelves should be marked off on both of the uprights placed edge to edge , careful measurements being made on both outside edges . The lowest shelf is 4 in. up , a line above at a distance of e in. gives the position of the top of the shelf . The next two are i in. above the top of the shelf immediately below . For nailing , draw a line to indicate the centre of the shelf thickness and then drive four 2 in. wire nails through both upright sides into each shelf . Keep the nails quite upright and if the tool is available , use a punch so that the head of each nail can be driven just below the surface . The nail holes can be filled in with plastic wood before the shelf is painted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or enamel . In the example , the shelf was nailed to the architraves of the doors , but if this is not possible , two brass mirror or glass plates , can be screwed to the back of the top and bottom shelves so that nails can be driven through into the wall ; use Rawlplugs in a soft wall . // The attractive window seat shown on the next page can be made by the housewife with two or three suitable boxes , some strips of wood and some plywood . The hangings and the cushions are simple . Although the illustrations show a method of dealing with a square cornered recess , it is a simple matter to fill in a recess having a considerably wider angle . It will be seen in the lower diagram that suitable boxes must be provided ; a height from 12 in. to 15 in. will do , the boxes therefore should be the required width or height . The number of boxes will depend on the length of the recess . The top , made of plywood , should be measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be obtained cut ready to size . A few nails driven through the plywood into the upright portions of the boxes , as indicated by the arrow heads , will keep the seat together . If the plywood top should project beyond the ends of the boxes owing to the outward splay of the walls of the recess , it will be necessary to provide a support ; either an extra box should be taken apart and the ends fitted against the wall , or a suitable strip , say about 2 in. by z in. , nailed to the wall on each side . The curtains and pelmet , if required , can be suspended from a length of brass or iron rod resting on the picture rail as shown , or secured to the wall with screw eyes . The drapery at the back of the seat can be cut to the required depth , sewn to Rufflette tape , and either tacked at intervals to a strip of wood nailed to the wall under the shelf or window frame , or it can be threaded on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in position with screw eyes . The same method can be applied to the drapery in front of the boxes . The cushions can be made from spring units and provided with suitable covers to a thickness of from 3 in. to 4 in . Suggestions for making cushions are given on page 94. 68 // During recent years the divan bed has become popular ; the wooden and the brass bedstead with its high framework does not lend itself to modern ideas . Although the adaption of the metal framed bedstead is more difficult , the work of transforming a wooden bedstead to conform with modern conditions is simple . A suggestion is given on the next page for modernising the ordinary wooden bedstead by cutting down the tall head to replace the usually lower foot , the latter being instead used as the head . First dismantle the bedstead and remove the side bed irons , and take off the brackets from the head piece . Next saw down the lower portion of the wooden frame to a convenient height , from z ft. to z ft. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct height for the brackets , screw them on in their new position and then fit the side irons . Bedsteads with solid ends or with curved tops are not quite so easy to alter , but usually there is some portion of the framework at which the sawing can be done . Care must be taken that shortening does not weaken the construction . As a rule it is advisable to leave the brass bedstead alone , but the plain iron bedstead as indicated at the bottom of the next page can be modernised by covering the head and foot with a casing of wood . No constructional alterations are needed in regard to the iron framework , the latter being first covered on the outside with lengths of r z in. by i in. wood fitted closely to sides and top . The upright lengths should be about i in. from the floor to allow for the castors . Cover the outside of the wooden frame with plywood at both ends . The inside , head and foot , should be covered as far as the side irons top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either flush with the frame or allowed to project sufficiently to allow for strips of plywood to cover the frame . // A dripping tap or faucet is not only annoying but it is wasteful ; the cure is easily effected by fitting a new washer . All ordinary taps are made in three parts comprising the supply pipe , otherwise the spout , the stem and nut combined , and the washer which is attached to a plug or jumper . First of all , the position of the main stop-cock should be discovered , and the main water supply must be shut off . In modern plumbing , it is usual to fit a stop-cock inside the house at some convenient place , otherwise it will be necessary to shut off the supply at the point outside the house where it is attached to the inside main supply . Now turn on the tap and drain off the water ; this is also necessary to make sure that the supply is disconnected . The next job is to loosen the big nut around the stem : this must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stem and remove the plug or jumper . The washer , which may be rubber , leather or composition , is usually attached to the plug with a small nut ; remove this and fit on a new washer . Before replacing the washer , examine the inside of the tap to see that none of the old washer remains , then fit in the plug , replace the stem and tighten up the big nut , using the monkey-wrench to turn it , and making it as tight as possible . Finally turn on the main supply and turn off the tap . Some modern taps , as shown in the diagram , have a metal casing over the large nut attached to the stem . So that sufficient room can be provided for the wrench , it will be necessary to undo the stem and open the tap fully , the shield or cover is now unscrewed and lifted up the stem . When dealing with a tap attached to the hot-water system , unless a special stop-cock has been provided , it will be necessary to empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 7z // Electric cords and flex are used to connect the electric iron , the bowl , the heater and other appliances to the power plug . They should in all cases be kept dry and in good condition , and they must be unbroken . With continual use , it often happens that one or more of the connections may break off and the flow of current will cease . In most cases , a sudden breakage will cause a fuse to blow out . First of all disconnect the cord from the supply , not by pulling the cord , but by gripping the plug firmly and withdrawing the pins from the power point . It should be noted that carelessness in disconnecting the supply by pulling the cord instead of the plug is a frequent cause of damage . There are a number of devices which act as plugs , but in the main it will be found that the two wires from the cord are attached to the plug by small screws . Examine the plug carefully and then undo the screw or screws which keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a turn or two to release any attached wire and then turn the screws back far enough to free the small holes entirely . Examine the end of the cord and cut away sufficient of the outside insulating covering to expose enough of the twin wires to fit inside the plug . Note that the twin wires are also covered with insulating rubber ; enough of the covering should be removed to leave at least z in. of bare wire . Now twist the fine strands of wire together and fold over as shown , twist up tightly , insert in the holes provided and then screw up , leaving no stray portions of wire exposed . Finally screw on the cap and the plug is ready to insert into the point . In the course of time , electric cords are liable to deterioration caused by the hardening of the insulation . It is essential that all such means of supply should be examined periodically and if necessary renewed . 74 // The fuse is a safety device which " blows out " when the current is overloaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an already overworked circuit will blow out a fuse and often a similar appliance or a bowl fire attached to an already overloaded lighting circuit will be sufficient to overload it . A defective plug or a damaged flex or cord will cause a short circuit resulting in an abnormally large flow of current which will also melt the fuse . Actually , the fuse is a fine wire attached to two contact plates which fit in a specially designed appliance known as the fuse box . Usually the fuse box is situated close to the main supply meter , and it contains a number of removable sockets each connected with a separate circuit . It is usual to have separate fuse boxes for the lighting and the heating circuits . The circuit is the wiring to and from the main supply to which are attached the lamp sockets for lighting , or in the case of heating or power , the fires or other appliances using a high consumption of current . The first thing to do when the fuse blows is to turn off the main switch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important and should on no account be neglected . Next open the box and withdraw the sockets one by one until the one containing the burnt out wire is discovered . The operation of renewing the wire is a simple job , and consists of undoing the connecting screws , removing the burnt ends of the old wire and wiping the porcelain quite clean . Cut off a suitable length and , if necessary , straighten it out . The correct fuse wire to use depends on the voltage of the main supply and on the particular circuit . The size of the wire is reckoned in amps and the correct gauge should be ascertained from the source of the supply . Having procured the wire , attach it to the screws as indicated , replace the socket and finally turn on the current . 76 // The economical housewife should keep a careful check on the consumption of electricity and gas , and this can be done by reading the dials of the meters . Within the capacity of the circuit , it does not matter how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra lights or small appliances such as an electric iron , a toaster or even a small bowl fire should be at any time added to the circuit , it is probable that the circuit would become overloaded and the fuse would blow out . This point should be watched carefully , and as a rule , no more than the usual load should be allowed . Electricity is measured by a meter which indicates the number of watts used . The watt is a small unit and the distributing unit is the kilowatt , or i , 000 watts . The dials on the front of the meter register i o ; i oo ; I , 000 and i o , 000 . In the example shown on the next page , the right-hand dial reads 8o , the next 300 , which plus the 8o shows 380 . The third indicates 5,000 , giving 5,38o , and the last one , having just passed the index i , shows a total consumption of 15,380 . The charge for each distributing unit varies with the supply , but knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas , although not greatly used for lighting , is still in everyday use for cooking and heating . It is distributed through pipes and although not subject to troubles connected with overloading and blown fuses , it is necessary to prevent leakage which , if not remedied , may lead to serious explosions . The meter to register the consumption of gas indicates cubic feet ; there are generally three dials , the dial on the right measures zoo feet , the next one indicates 1,000 's and the third Io , 000 feet . The meter reading as shown on the next page , reads 400 , 9,000 and 70,000 , altogether 79,400 . When the indicator is between numbers , the lesser number is taken . The charges are by feet or a number of feet , indicated by a therm . 78 // There are two kinds of thermometers which should be in every household , one to measure the heat of the atmosphere , or of water and other liquids , and is mounted usually on a wood or metal support , the other is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a clinical thermometer . This is a plain glass tube and is kept in a metal case when not in use . Heat on a thermometer is measured by degrees and there are two scales in ordinary use ; Fahrenheit gives the freezing point at 32 ? and boiling point at 2zo ? . The Centigrade scale has the freezing point at o , with the boiling point at oo ? . The former is in use generally . A bath thermometer , usually enclosed in a wooden case , as shown on the next page , should be part of a normal bathroom equipment , and is specially useful in obtaining a suitable temperature for children 's baths . Metal cased thermometers are also useful for gauging the heat of an oven when cooking . Some thermometers are arranged to show the maximum and the minimum temperatures and require adjustment from time to time . The most useful form for the household has either a mercury or alcohol filled tube ; the scale indications show freezing point at 3 2 ? , temperate heat at 6o ? , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 65 ? , and as far as possible the temperature inside the house should not greatly exceed this reading . Although many people are accustomed to keep rooms at a higher temperature , it is far healthier to avoid overheated rooms . The clinical thermometer is used in illness ; the scale usually runs from about 95 ? to i 1 o ? , with an arrow mark to indicate normal blood heat which is just above 98 ? . The degrees are divided into five parts and the temperature is read by degrees and points . After use clinical thermometers should be dipped in an antiseptic solution , dried and the mercury shaken down . 8o 8i WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Household scales are an important part of the kitchen equipment . The ordinary old-fashioned balance with its range of weights is not so convenient as the lever spring balance with a large dial . Apart from the compactness of the latter appliance , the adjusting screw will allow of bowls and plates with their contents to be weighed instead of placing everything on the pan . The receptacle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adjusting screw . There are many equivalents to weights and measures , especially the latter ; a knowledge of them will save time in the kitchen . For example , 3 teaspoonfuls make one tablespoonful , 16 tablespoonfuls make one cup . The contents of a cup measure 8 fluid ounces , z cups make a pint and z pints make a quart ; or 4 gills make a pint , and 2 pints make a quart . In any case these measurements are only approximate , but answer for plain cooking . In order to obtain uniformity in measurement , it is advisable to keep a special spoon and cup and in using them , level off or fill to the brim . The weights of various materials differ considerably . For example , z cups of granulated sugar weigh approximately i lb. , while a similar quantity of flour weighs about i lb . A level tablespoonful of liquid weighs about 2 oz. , the same weight in sugar and butter can be gauged by the same measure . Metric measurements are often quoted and a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under one-third of an inch , a metre is just over i yard . A litre measures a little less than a quart and a metric gram is a trifle less than a third of an ounce . All these measurements are approximate only . Measures of length should , as a rule , be made with a tape measure or a yard stick . A square yard measures 3 ft. each way , and contains 9 sq . ft. , and each square foot contains 144 square inches . 8z // The hat wardrobe illustrated on the next page is easily made and provides a useful fitment ; it can be suspended from a convenient hook or placed on the floor in a corner of the room . It is made from discs of cardboard or plywood supported by lengths of prepared dowelling . Provide four 36 in. long dowels about s in. diameter and four circular pieces of stout cardboard , millboard , or thin plywood cut to a diameter of approximately i 2 in . Divide the outside of the circles into four equal parts and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dowel . If possible the top and bottom pieces should be plywood , with cardboard inner discs . Divide the height into three equal parts , bind some wire from side to side , cut out slots in the circumference of the discs and fit them inside the uprights . Bind some fairly stout wire about i in. below and above the top and bottom pieces respectively to provide means for attaching the fabric cover . The opening should be a section between two uprights and the material fastened to small rings which can be threaded on the wires . SHOE TIDY The illustration at the bottom of the next page shows an easily made shoe tidy intended for attaching to the lower position of the bedroom door . The material used can be of any suitable fabric such as cretonne and the back piece should be made to the full width of the door and about 12 in. deep . On all sides provide a hem to take suitable length of s in. or z in. diameter dowels which should meet at the corners . The width of the pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size depends on the width of the door and it may be possible to arrange for more than four pockets . 84 // Although the term basket is usually applied to receptacles made of osier and cane , it can be used generally to describe any form of container for waste paper . It is convenient to provide a place for depositing waste paper and odds and ends in every room . Several suggestions for simple boxes are shown . Empty biscuit boxes suitably painted and decorated make excellent receptacles . The paper covering should be stripped off and the surfaces , both inside and out , thoroughly washed . For painting use an enamel or a cellulose paint , but apply a preliminary coat of ordinary paint as an undercoat which should be rubbed down smooth with pumice powder or glasspaper when quite dry . Decoration can be stencilled . Wood boxes can be made from suitable pieces of plywood which can be nailed with panel pins or glued and nailed to a triangular fillet of wood at each corner . The plywood can be painted or stained with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another form of basket can be made from lengths of dowelling . These are obtained in a number of thicknesses : one about z in. diameter is convenient . The dowels should be cut to a length of 12 in. or so , holes are bored with a gimlet about i in. or so from the ends and then the lengths are threaded on lengths of wire with suitable wooden beads in between . The dowels and the beads can be enamelled before threading . The bottom can be made from a tin lid , plywood or miliboard . The inside should be lined with cretonne or other material . Cardboard is also suitable . Panels should be cut to size and may be covered entirely with paper or fabric . Ordinary flour paste is a convenient adhesive . In the shape shown at the bottom of the page , the six panels are separately covered , holes punched on the sides to allow for lacing with cord as indicated . 86 // The upholstered box shown on the next page is quite easily made , and besides forming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptacle for needlework or slippers . The material used for covering the box can be similar to that used for loose covers , and provides a useful means of utilising odd pieces . An ordinary small packing case of a suitable size makes an excellent box for the purpose . It will be necessary to provide a top which can be hinged to one side of the case . A piece of plywood at least in. thick should be used . In addition the ends of the case , if of the particular kind shown , should be filled in with wood or any suitable packing . The hinges can be screwed as shown on the outside edge of the lid and the case . The top can be padded with curled hair ; an excellent material is that known as hairlok , it is a mixture of hair and rubber , forming a springy pad . There are many suitable forms of filling , but for lasting wear , hair is best . The filling should be distributed evenly on the surface to a thickness of about z in. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several ways of attaching the fabric to the sides of the case : in the illustration on the next page , the material is folded over top and bottom . It should be carried completely round the case and secured on all edges . Fabric covered studs can be used , but the material can be tacked on with gimp pins . If the extra work and material is not an objection , it is worth while covering the sides and the padded top with upholsterer 's wadding . At least one layer should be used under the covering material . It will be found a convenience to fix some kind of castor on the bottom of the box . Wheel castors can be used , but a good quality ball castor will be found more satisfactory . They are easily attached with screws . The finished box can be lined with paper or glazed cloth pasted on . // In order to obtain the best results from the use of a sewing machine , it must , like all pieces of machinery , be kept in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in use the machine should be covered and protected from dust . When it is in use a certain amount of dust will work its way into the bearings , and from time to time all accessible parts should be wiped clean with an oily rag . Manufacturers of sewing machines usually provide a handbook giving full instructions as to oiling and cleaning and supply a special oil or recommend a suitable brand . The special oil known as " Three-in-One " is ideal for machines , as it prevents rust as well as lubricates . On no account should thick lubricating oil be used . If a machine has been neglected or has not been in use for a long time , it is possible that the oil in some of the working parts has become oxidised and hardened . The remedy is to brush all the parts , both inside and out , with paraffin , wipe clean and then apply new oil . It is an advantage to remove the needle and run the machine for some time to allow the oil to work into the bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles do occur , they can be traced to faults in adjustment . Attention should be paid to correct tension , to winding bobbins correctly , to use of good cotton or silk , and to see that the needle is suitable for the material and a correct one for the particular make of machine . For occasional use the hand machine will be found to give every satisfaction , but greater ease in working can be obtained with a treadle machine , examples of both machines are shown on the next page . A modern improvement which removes most of the laborious work in machining is embodied in the treadle machine illustrated : it consists of a small electric motor drive together with an electric light which illuminates the needle . This attachment is equally suitable for the hand machine . 90 91 // Bindings of various materials can be applied with the Binder attachment . This attachment folds and guides the binding , and by a simple adjustment the stitching can be regulated to come close to the edge of the binding . Binding suitably applied , forms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and articles for home decoration . The Foot Hemmer and the adjustable hemmer may be used for a variety of purposes . Hemming of all widths is easily done and hemming and the sewing of a lace edge can be carried out in one operation . This is one of the most useful of the available attachments . Another useful attachment is the Tucker . Tucks may be made in any width , from a fine pin tuck to one inch wide ; they form a natural trimming for fine materials such as lawn , organdie , batiste , etc. , and are so easily made that it is a pleasure to use the attachment . Ruffling has long played an important part in trimming garments and the Rufj/er furnished with the Singer machine will make ruffles of any desired fullness at a speed of ten yards in ten minutes . By a simple adjustment the ruffles can be changed into dainty plaits . This attachment is a wonderful time saver when making trimmings , and it is so simple to use that perfect results may easily be obtained . Photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite page . The Quilter is another useful attachment and enables perfect quilting to be done with the greatest ease . Small pieces of quilting may be used for making up into cushions and for many other decorative purposes . Small articles such as duchesse sets , nightdress cases , are articles suitable for quilted fabrics . For decorative work , the Underbraider will be found of the utmost value . Any braid that will fit the underbraider tube and may be stitched through the centre can be used with the attachment . // Cushions form such an important item in the comfort and decoration of a room , that considerable care should be taken that they conform to individual requirements . No article of furniture can add such a distinguishing feature to the colour scheme , or to the sense of comfort , as a well-designed cushion . The essential feature of any cushion should be comfort . Cushions can be covered with almost any kind of material that will either blend well with existing upholstery or will provide that essential piece of contrast that a successful colour scheme demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns can be arranged in patchwork , suitable material can be woven on a loom ; in fact , the possibilities in providing suitable materials are practically unlimited . Cushions provide an excellent way to use quiltings and give scope for putting quilted patterns to good use . Three different types of cushion are illustrated on the next page . The oblong cushion shown at the top of the page is very easily made in the form of a bag with fringed ends . The filling should be with small feathers or soft down ; there are several suitable materials for cushion filling which are quite inexpensive . The round cushion is suitable for utilising simple embroidery work such as cross stitch and petit-point , for using up beautiful pieces of brocade or tapestry , or for pieces of plain soft silk . The top and bottom are cut to the required diameter and the sides made in one length . Silk cord or a narrow frill will make excellent edgings . Square cushions are useful for modern furniture and are made similarly to the round cushion . The shape lends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inserted . The square cushion is often made in soft leather , the edges being finished with a piped edge or joined with leather thongs . The filling in a leather cushion can be kept in place by buttons . 94 // The particular form of floor cushion known as a pouffe is made in a variety of shapes and sizes . Suggestions are given on the next page for both the square and the round type , but in addition , very useful pouffes can be made from a lidded box with padded surfaces covered with fabric or leather , as shown on page 88 . Pouffes are made similarly to cushions with any suitable fabric . For use in a room furnished with tapestry covered chairs , it is usual to make the case with similar material , but the underside should be made with strong linen or leather in order to withstand the wear . First of all make a case from canvas , hessian or any fairly strong fabric . Odd pieces from the rag-bag can be joined up in patchwork fashion , because the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is strong . The case can be made to the required depth , but if made in two or more layers , filling will be easier . Horsehair , especially when fully curled , makes the best filling , but wool , cotton mixture , or torn up rags can be used . There are other materials suitable for stuffing the case such as dried fibre , fine wood shavings . The filling should be distributed carefully inside the case , an upholsterer 's needle will be found serviceable . It is advisable to run stitches right through the packing at intervals to prevent it from moving from side to side . The outer case should be made to fit the inner case as closely as possible . Piped edging is done similarly to that shown on the cushion on page 94 . The circular pouffe is finished as a cylinder and tightened up with a cord as indicated . In planning out the material , as far as possible the top , bottom and the sides should be separate pieces , allowing sufficient for hemming . These portions may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a good plan , when making loose covers , to use up the scrap lengths in making covers for existing or new pouffes. 96 // Linen can be marked with a specially prepared ink or with linen and silk thread , the latter being worked directly on the material or on tape . The advantages of ink are rapidity and cheapness , but for good style and service-ableness the thread method is preferable , as , in time , the ink may destroy the fibres , thus causing a hole . The size of the marking depends on the article and the style mainly on individual taste . As a rule , hand-kerchiefs are marked at one corner , with either an initial , a monogram or a name . Table napkins are similarly marked . Sheets , pillow-cases and towels are generally marked in the middle of the hemmed end , about 6 in. from the hem to read from the end . Small guest towels are often marked with a monogram in the centre of one half a few inches up from the hem . Table-cloths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or initial to show on the top of the table about 6 in. from the edge to the right of the hostess . Some suggestions are given on the next page for suitable embroidered markings . Some thought should be given to the choice of lettering used either for names , initials or monograms . In all cases select a regular place for the marking and adopt a standard form . The accepted colour for embroideries is usually white ; plain letters , initials and simple monograms can be done quickly in chain , stem or cross stitch . This simple stitch is to be preferred to the more elaborate and raised embroidery for linens which are normally washed by machinery , but for decorative purposes the raised letter is most effective and will last a long time . The style of lettering decided upon should be drawn out on paper and transferred to the linen with carbon paper . Another method is to use stiff paper , prick holes through at close intervals , use a muslin pounce bag filled with fine resin and then cover with tissue paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife who can use a sewing machine can make darns in household napery in a fraction of the time required for hand darning , and the work will be infinitely superior in appearance and will wear and wash better . The only special fittings required for the work ? all of which may be obtained for a small outlay ? are a Darning or Embroidery Hoop , a small plate to cover the feed and a little Spring Presser to hold the material in position while the needle is on its upward course . To ensure a soft smooth finish , it is essential that a fine needle and fine mercerised cotton should be used ; these can be obtained from Singer shops . Ordinary cotton results in a rather stiffer and heavier darn . As the feed of the machine has been covered by the feed cover plate , it will be understood that the movement of the work and the length of the stitch must be controlled by the operator moving the darning hoop . A slow movement of the hand will give a short stitch and a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of material will give confidence . The hoop should be held with both hands as shown on the next page , and with a steady continuous move-ment , the work is done backwards and forwards across the hole , keeping the stitches an equal distance apart and running about 4 in. beyond the edge of the hole and working in the same direction as the weft or fine threads of the material . After the stitching has been completed one way , turn the hoop round and continue in a similar manner across the first line of stitching . These second lines of stitching should be closer together and run parallel with the warp or thicker threads of the material . Take this stitching about 2 in. beyond the hole , thus covering the first lines of thread entirely . This will strengthen the material without giving a heavy darn . Ioo 1 OI IO2 CLEANING POTS AND PANS Although not always a pleasant job , the cleansing of pots and pans is an important item in culinary duties . In order to reduce the work of cleaning , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible after use . Hot water is essential for greasy utensils and cold water for utensils used for milk and egg dishes . Equipment for cleaning pots and pans should include soap and fine steel wool , soda and abrasive powder , wooden skewers and newspaper , whiting , oil and metal polish , and suitable cloths for drying . Aluminium pots and pans are now more commonly used than those made with other metals . Aluminium is slightly affected by acids and alkalis , but not sufficiently so to be injurious . Vegetables will discolour the metal , but acids and fruits brighten and clean it . Do not clean with soda , wash only with pure soap and hot water . Polishing should be done with fine steel wool used with a little soap and hot water and , if a high polish is required , use finely powdered whiting with steel wool ; the prepared wool and soap known as Brillo is excellent . Kitchen utensils made of brass , copper , iron and tin can be washed with hot water and soda to remove grease and rinsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abrasive , using newspaper instead of cloth . Rinse afterwards with hot soap suds , then with clean hot water , and wipe dry while still hot . Tinned saucepans should not be allowed to be in contact with soda for more than a few minutes , they should be rinsed in soapy water , then hot water , and also dried while hot . It should be understood that tinned utensils will not stand continual scouring without gradually wearing out the deposit . Pewter pots can be cleaned with an abrasive powder , or fine steel wool and oil , washed with soapy and then clean water . Brass and copper utensils are cleaned with metal polish , rinsed and dried warm . 103 T MENDING POTS AND PANS It is not always necessary to be able to use a soldering bit before a leaky saucepan can be repaired , because small holes can be filled in with pot menders in a perfectly satisfactory manner . In fact while a soldered patch would be ideal for a tin saucepan , it would be difficult to solder a patch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the same form of repair on aluminium . Pot menders in several sizes are obtainable at most of the household stores and are very inexpensive ; they consist of two discs of tin , one disc of thin cork , a small screw and nut and a spanner as indicated in the illustration . They are usually supplied on a card , and it is therefore a good plan to keep a card of menders in readiness . Before the mender is used , the hole should be enlarged if it is smaller than the small screw ; this can be done with the pointed end of an old pair of scissors or with the end of a file and then both surfaces should be scraped quite bright , using an old knife or some emery cloth . The method of fixing the menders is perfectly simple . First place one of the discs of tin on the screw , then fit the piece of thin cork on top . The projecting end of the screw should be pushed through the hole from the inside of the pot to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the remaining disc of tin over the projecting screw and picking up the small nut , screw it on as tightly as possible with the fingers . In order to screw up the nut as closely as it is essential that it should be , hold a screwdriver on the bolt from the inside to prevent it turning round , and then place the spanner on the nut on the outside and turn it slowly and gradually until it is difficult to give it another turn . New handles for a saucepan or kettle lid can be made by using an ordinary bottle cork and driving a wood screw into it from underneath . In the case of small leaks round the spout , it is possible to obtain in tube form , a metallic paste to spread over the leak , // Household crockery in everyday use is usually quite easy to replace and repairs are rarely practicable , especially if the articles have to be washed frequently in hot water . In the case of valuable pieces of china and porcelain , repairs can be carried out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs , the work should be undertaken as soon as possible after the fracture . If the broken parts are exposed to the air , they are apt to become dusty and the surface will absorb a certain amount of grease from the atmosphere . If arrangements can not be made at once , all the broken parts should be wrapped carefully in clean paper and kept as air-tight as possible . Broken plates and ornaments can be repaired with liquid glue or one of the special cements sold for the purpose . The glue should be applied with a brush which should be perfectly clean and the thinnest possible film of glue or cement spread on the fractured places . Avoid touching the broken places with the fingers ; a certain amount of grease can not be avoided if the fingers are allowed to touch the absorbent pottery . A considerable amount of pressure should be applied to the cemented join ; this must , of course , be consistent with the strength of the article . A join in a plate can be pulled up very tightly by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood as indicated on the next page . Joins in a vase or similar article are not so easily clamped up . Finger pressure must be applied to work out any excess of glue in the joint and then the article can be bound up with gummed paper tape . Broken tea-pot and jug handles can be repaired with cement , but in addition it will be necessary to strengthen the join by strips of cane or wire on the inside and , if possible , the outside bend , and then binding the whole together with fine wire or cane . For oven crockery , repairs can be made with specially prepared cement . io6 // FIREPLACES The replacing of a loose tile in the fireplace or on a wall or shelf is a matter for immediate attention . Failure to attend at once to a cracked , broken or loose tile may lead to those surrounding the defective one also becoming loose or damaged . In modern construction it is usual for tiles to be bedded in a cement formed of equal parts of sand and Portland cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris composition is often used , the latter being softer and much easier to remove than cement . In any case , the first job is to clean out the space that has been occupied by the tile . In doing this , care must be taken to see that the surrounding tiles are not loose ; if they are , it will be necessary to pull them out as well . If they should still be firmly bedded in , care must be exercised to prevent them being loosened when chipping out any cement or plaster which may adhere to the edges . A good tool for cleaning out the space is an old table knife cut off short and ground to an edge . A wide screwdriver is also useful . Scrape away all plaster on the edges as well , work out the back to leave a depth at least a in. , preferably 4 in. more than the thickness of the tile . When the recessing has been completed , clean out with a wet brush , to remove dust and particles and leave the surface in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement preparations such as Stixit made up in tube form , which are easily applied and quite effective . Portland cement is readily obtainable ; this can be used neat and mixed with water . To be economical , Portland cement should be mixed with an equal part of fine sand and made into a mortar with water . Do not make cement too wet , just soft enough to move it easily . It can be applied with a knife , but it will be found that a small trowel is more convenient . Do not place the cement on a dry or smooth surface , Io8 109 this applies particularly to the large surface at the back , and do not apply it too thickly . Before replacing the tile , wet the back and edges and then press into position . It is a good plan to have a short block of wood long enough to overlap the tile and then press firmly from corner to corner until the surplus cement works out . When the tile has been bedded in , wipe off the cement with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the knife along the join to give a neat finish ; this is known as pointing . Give a final finish to the joint by a light rub with a damp cloth . Tiles on a wall call for more preparation than those on a hearth and it is advisable to rake out the joints in the brickwork as indicated on the next page . The rougher the surface the better , as it provides a secure hold for the cement . In the case of broken tiles , care must be taken to procure new tiles of the correct size . When dealing with window sills and recesses as shown ( p. 109 ) , the instructions given above will apply , but it will be found that the quarter-round slips require special care . Generally , it is advisable to fit in the flat tiles first and then the corners , but it depends on the position in which the tiles are placed . When dealing with horizontal surfaces , all the tiles can be replaced together , but with vertical tiling much more care must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tiles to be placed on a wall previously cemented or plastered , the back is chipped to give a number of deep grooves . Use an old chisel or a screwdriver . In repairing the firebrick at the back or sides of a fireplace , use a special heat-resisting cement such as Pyruma or Purimachos ; first clean out all the cracks with a fine stiff brush so that fine dust is removed . The special cement should be worked up to a paste and then the cracks should be washed out thoroughly with clean water . The cement should be pressed firmly into the cracks , using a trowel or a small knife , and smoothed off neatly . IIO FURNITURE POLISHES AND REVIVERS Considerable care should be exercised in the use of ready prepared furniture polishes and revivers . Surfaces that have been produced by wax or oil well rubbed into the grain can be kept in good condition by any polish having a wax basis , but highly french-polished surfaces and those produced by the application of hard glaze require special treatment . It should be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved in spirit and is finally hardened off by spirit alone . Care has to be taken that the polish does not remove the hardened surface ; this is easily done if it contains too much spirit . A temporary brilliancy can be produced by the socalled reviver which actually removes a slight amount of the surface , but if a polish containing a good proportion of wax is not applied at once , the surface will not last very long and is likely to " sweat . " An excellent polish can be made by shredding ri oz. of beeswax , ' oz. white wax , and i oz. of castile soap . Place it in a wide-necked jar with pint of turpentine , shake thoroughly until all the wax is dissolved . Now make a lather with white scented soap about the size of an egg with about 2 pint of boiling water , stir the saponified hot water very slowly into the mixture of wax and turpentine and beat it thoroughly to form a cream . This cream when cool should be suitably bottled and used sparingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circular motion and then polished with a soft polishing cloth . In all cases , furniture to be polished should be free from dust and grease , and it is advisable to wipe the polished surfaces first with a wet cloth dipped in warm water in which some pure soap flakes have been dissolved . Apply the polish to a dry surface . The main purpose of a polish is to enrich the surface to which it is to be applied , and in enriching it , a new film is produced . iii KEEPING SCISSORS AND KNIVES IN GOOD TRIM It is by no means a difficult job to keep scissors in first class cutting condition . If the scissors blade are examined , it will be seen that the cutting edges are inclined away from the flat inner faces of the blades . It is these narrow edges that should be kept sharp ; there is no need to sharpen the flat sides at all . A fine grade of oilstone is a convenience , but the blades can be sharpened almost as well on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the paper is glued to a flat strip of wood as shown . The scissors should be drawn along the paper with the inside of the blade sloping sufficiently to allow the cutting edge to be flat on the hone . The position is shown on a separate diagram ; the blade should be drawn along the hone without altering the inclination of the the blade , with just sufficient pressure to keep the steel in close contact with the abrasive surface . On further examination of the scissor blades , it will be seen that they are slightly curved towards the tip . The screw pivot should be kept tight enough to allow the whole length of the blades to touch as they are opened and closed . If the pivot should have worked loose , a turn of the screw with a screwdriver should be sufficient . In the case of scissors that have been well worn , and the screw thread does not tighten up , the remedy is to place the head of the screw on a piece of iron , a flat iron provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the screw pivot with a hammer as shown . This method of tightening the blade requires careful hammering , otherwise the blades may be tightened up too much for easy movement . Knives should be placed almost flat on the hone , pressed down firmly and drawn from one end of the hone to the other ; the main thing is to retain , as far as possible , the original angle . IIz // The handles of table knives are liable to work loose , especially if they are left in hot water ; the cement becomes soft and loses its tenacity . The remedy is to remove the blade , clean the tang as well as the hole and cement the handle on again . Usually , the handle becomes loose enough to be drawn off the tang quite easily , if there should be any difficulty , the blade should be gradually turned until the tang is free . Some of the old cement will cling to the tang and must be cleaned off with an old knife or a file , the tang should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to remove the cement remaining in the hole in the handle ; a suitable method , shown on the next page , is to use a bradawl as a drill . Keep the tool upright and turn it round , tapping out the old cement from time to time . There are several forms of paste and liquid cement which may be used , but the difficulty of filling the hole in the handle with anything but a dry powder , renders them inadvisable . By far the simplest method of cementing is to use powdered resin . Provide a small lump of resin , and pound it down in a basin to a fine powder . The simplest method of introducing the powder into the hole in the handle , is to place it in a small coneshaped bag with a small hole in the bottom as indicated . As the powder gradually fills up the hole , pack it lightly with a darning or knitting needle to ensure that the hole is completely filled . Now heat up the tang in a gas flame , not red-hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test can be made by placing the tang in a small pile of powder . Press the tang firmly and quickly into the handle , holding the blade in a cloth , making sure that the handle and blade are in the correct position . The success of cementing depends on having the tang hot enough to melt the resin at the bottom of the hole . Leave the cemented handle for an hour or two before it is moved . I14 WHEN THE SINK IS STOPPED UP Stoppage in the sink is caused usually by an accumulation of grease and small particles of food and grit . The sink should always be flushed out after use with hot soda solution to dissolve the grease and allow a free flow to the outside gulley . It is advisable to give the drainage pipe a good flushing with hot water at least once a day . If hot water and soda does not clear the pipe , fill up the sink to within a few inches of the top and use a force cup as indicated on the next page . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap underneath the Ushaped pipe must be unscrewed and the contents of the pipe run into a bucket . Care must be taken that the contents of the sink is not more than will fill a bucket underneath . It may be necessary to ease out the accumulated refuse with a skewer or a length of wire . When empty , the inside of the pipe should be cleaned out with a wire brush . After replacing the cap , flush out with a strong soda solution . The cap usually has two outside projections and it can be unscrewed by placing a screwdriver held horizontally between them . The outside gulley is also liable to become clogged , not only at the bottom but also on the inside of the Ubend . Deposits of grease will , if not cleaned off periodically , reduce the size of the opening . The gulley should be flushed out from time to time with a strong solution of soda or a special cleaning compound . In addition , a bent rod as indicated on the next page , should be used to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather it is advisable to flush all drains with a disinfectant about once a week . The iron rod suggested for the cleaning of gulleys can be used for clearing clogged W.C. pans . If the stoppage can not be cleared with the rod , a temporary force cup can be made by wrapping a piece of cloth or old blanket over a mop , tying it securely to the handle . 116 I17 REMOVING STAINS One of the household cupboards should contain preparations for removal of stains and spots . The longer a stain is allowed to remain , the more difficult it becomes to remove . One useful stand-by is Household Ammonia which may be obtained ready for use , or can be made by mixing pure ammonia with an equal quantity of water . An Oxalic Acid solution should also be made : dissolve I teaspoonful of oxalic acid crystals in i pint of water . Pour into a bottle and label in red letters " POISON . " A bottle of Javelle water is also useful for bleaching . It is made by first dissolving 1 lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next dissolve 4 lb. of chloride of lime in I quart of cold water and then mix the two together and allow to settle . The clear liquid is poured off , bottled and labelled . Carbon Tetrachloride should also find a place on the shelf as well as a large bottle of detergent ; the latter is made by dissolving 12 oz. of castile soap in I pint of hot water , add 3 quarts of cold water and then 4 ozs . of ammonia , i oz. alcohol and I oz. of ether . TABLE LINEN . Fruit stains can usually be removed , if treated at once , by placing the stained portion over a large bowl and pouring boiling water over it . If this method is not effective , bleach with oxalic acid and follow with ammonia , afterwards wash . Stubborn spots can usually be removed by first applying a permanganate of potassium solution , as soon as colour changes to brown , apply oxalic acid and finally ammonia . Iron rust , if not too old , can be removed with lemon juice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ammonia and finally soap and water . CLOTHING . The household detergent given above will be found excellent for use in sponging woollen fabrics . Either a sponge , soft cloth or a brush can be used . After cleaning , wipe over with clean warm I18 water and press when nearly dry . To remove grease spots use ammonia ; if not effective , try carbon tetra-chloride applied with a soft clean cloth . Rings may surround the cleaned spot if too much liquid is used . Many stains such as those caused by sugar , egg , and blood can be removed by cold water alone , and will often disappear after sponging with a detergent . Any stain caused by a greasy substance , including milk , cream , ice cream , gravy , and liquids containing milk should be taken out with carbon tetrachloride . Ink spots should not be rubbed ; apply a damp cloth at once so that the ink is absorbed . Stubborn spots should be treated with oxalic acid , the latter being dropped exactly on the spot , absorbed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia . Grass stains can be removed with Fullers Earth or glycerine , and wiped with a damp cloth or washed . MILDEW . This is caused by allowing clothes to remain damp in a warm place or through clothing being kept in a damp cupboard or chest . The stain can be removed with Javelle water or oxalic acid followed by ammonia . The formation of mildew is preventable and does not occur with dry clothing . CARPET AND FLOOR STAINS . For carpets , use one of the methods described above according to the particular kind of stain . Ink stains on the floor or on unvarnished wood can be taken out with oxalic acid followed by ammonia to neutralise the acid . Ink stains on polished wood are more difficult to remove . If they can not be wiped off with plain water , either oxalic acid or spirit must be used , but these fluids will also remove some of the polish . In the latter case , the cleaned place should be re-polished . PAINT AND VARNISH . Ordinary paint and varnish spots can be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with amyl acetate . Delicate materials such as silk should be lightly rubbed with carbon tetrachloride. // It is much more trouble , as a rule , to prepare a floor for staining than to apply the stain , but it is so important that the job must neither be neglected or hurried if a lasting finish is desired . Projecting nails should be hammered down , and although not essential , the heads of the nails should be driven below the surface with a nail punch . This is particularly important when dealing with old floors . Rough places , also caused by wear or bad planing should be smoothed ; the simplest and most effective tool is a hook scraper as shown in the diagram . The same tool can be used to level the edges of boards that have curled up . It is inexpensive and has a variety of uses in the home . Small holes caused by nails , places where the knots have dropped out , unsightly gaps between boards and any mouse holes should be filled with plastic wood , or filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This material may be stained by mixing some of the stain with it . Finally the floor should be scrubbed thoroughly and rinsed quite clean . Allow the floor to dry and then rub it over with glasspaper to leave the wood as smooth as possible . Before any stain is applied the floor should be swept free from dust and must be perfectly dry . If a stained surround only is required , carry out the above operations only on the portions to be stained , but if the remainder of the floor is to be covered with either carpet or linoleum , it is always advisable to make quite sure that there are no projecting nails or large holes , otherwise the floor covering will get damaged . Floors that have been previously stained should be washed . As far as possible the old coating of stain should be removed , either by scraping or by the application of strong soda or sugar soap . After using either solvent the floor should be rinsed clean . I20 I2I STAINING AND POLISHING FLOORS Before staining is done , the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be quite dry and clean . There are two methods of treatment , one is to use a stain first and then to polish with prepared wax , the other is to combine the two operations and use an oil varnish stain such as Varnene . With ordinary staining , care should be taken to provide a stain of good quality . It is possible to stain new floors quite effectively with a strong solution of permanganate of potash . One of the most effective stains for floors , as well as other woodwork , is Colron ; it is a wood dye with considerable penetrating power , and is available in a number of pleasing shades . The stain can be applied with a special felt brush or with an ordinary bristle brush as indicated . The liquid should be applied in the direction of the grain and brushed on evenly , allowing the dye to work well into the grain . Do not try and make the stain cover as much ground as possible , but apply just enough to soak into the wood . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well known wax floor polishes can be applied , the method being to use a generous amount of wax and rub it well into the grain with a hard brush . Too much trouble can not be taken to apply a good coating of wax . Leave the floor for a day or two before the final polishing is done with a soft cloth or a special floor polisher . An oil varnish stain is easily applied ; work in the direction of the grain as shown in the photograph , using as wide a brush as possible . In order to prevent loose fibres , the brush should be of good quality and rubber-set . This particular stain does not dry rapidly like a combined spirit stain and varnish ; it is much more effective and gives a lasting surface . Oil varnish stain is equally suitable for furniture . I22 I23 // Walls covered with paper require dusting even more than those finished with distemper or paint . A soft brush is more useful than a cloth , and , if fitted with a long handle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dust marks that have been rubbed into the surface of the paper can be cleaned off with one of the gum or paste cleaners supplied for the purpose , but a ready means , shown on the opposite page , is to use stale bread . Rub lightly , but firmly , until the bread crumbles away . Finger marks are usually difficult to remove , as are any other form of grease deposited on the surface . A useful method which will remove most grease spots is to soak a piece of lint or absorbent cotton in some grease solvent , such as alcohol or carbon tetrachloride . Apply the wet pad to the place and press firmly ; this process must be repeated until the grease is absorbed by the pad ; a good many applications will be needed to obtain a successful result . Small spots of grease can often be removed by covering them with two or three thicknesses of blotting paper and placing a hot iron on top . The iron must not be hot enough to scorch the paper , just sufficiently hot to melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift up the torn portion and smooth it out , being careful not to damage the edges in any way . Mix up some flour paste or make a paste with prepared powder and place in a basin or jar in a convenient position . Cover a book or piece of board with clean wrapping paper and press the torn portion over as indicated . Apply the paste to the back of the torn strip as shown ; do not attempt to apply any paste to the wall . Allow a few minutes for the paste to moisten the paper and then press carefully in position . If a rubber roller is available , press the paper down , if not , cover with clean blotting paper and smooth down , working to the point of the tear . I2f CLEANING DISTEMPERED WALLS There are several ways of cleaning distemper , or wat paint as it is sometimes called ; these depend on th kind of distemper used and the condition of the surfac Walls discoloured by damp or by the lime in the ceme or in the plaster coating can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying new distemper . Greas marks must be removed by a solvent before any furthe treatment of the surface can be undertaken . If the walls have been treated with a washable di temper , clean water applied with a sponge will brighte up the surface , but the sponge and the water must b kept clean . It is , however , a better plan to try the effec of a brush first . Use a good quality boot brush wit stiff bristles and work with a circular motion from th top of the wall downwards . The dry brush will remov a certain amount of fine powder , but usually it wi leave the wall clean . Thick grease spots should be scraped off and the the mark cleaned with a rag soaked in carbon ultra chloride , petrol , gasolene or strong soda . In any cas it will be difficult to take out any grease mark by scrapin without removing some of the distemper underneath Greasy finger marks however can often be remove from a distempered wall by first covering the plac with clean blotting paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been removed , the wall shoul be lightly brushed over with a hard dry brush . As it is difficult to avoid marks on a distempere wall and also difficult to match the exact tint , it is alway advisable to retain a small quantity of the original was in a tightly stoppered bottled , or air-tight tin , so tha damaged places may be covered with new distemper Use a stiff paint brush , a stencil brush is ideal , spread some of the distemper on a piece of board , fill in th damaged portion thickly and then stipple the edge so that the wash is gradually merged into the main surface iz6 I27 CLEANING PAINT WORK All painted surfaces seem to have a special attraction for dust and grease from the atmosphere , especially in foggy weather , and if this film of grease and dust is allowed to remain on the paint , the oxidising and discolouring acids contained in it will gradually penetrate and cause discoloration . The remedy is frequent washing with pure soap suds , and warm water . Strong soaps containing soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , paint will retain its freshness for a long time , the contaminated air of the town areas , especially where there are many factories , will cause painted surfaces to deteriorate in a few months . This is likely to happen with even the best qualities of paint , but with careful treatment it will retain its freshness for a long time . Cleaning paint does not mean hard rubbing ; generally all that is necessary is to make a lather of pure soap flakes , apply it with a sponge , and then wash the soapy water with a clean sponge , finally drying with a cloth . For paint work in kitchens , where more than the ordinary amount of grease is likely to be deposited , it is advisable to use a solvent , such as sugar soap or soda , but it should be used sparingly and rinsed off with tepid water directly the paint is clean . Polish with a dry cloth . The gloss on a highly enamelled surface , particularly in the case of an oil enamel , may lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to polish the surface with a soft chamois leather . With dark shades , use a few drops of linseed oil , but with pale tints , such as white and cream , use a little olive oil . Soak a small pad of cotton wool with the oil , wrap the pad inside a piece of soft linen or cambric ( an old handkerchief is excellent ) , rub very lightly over the surface and then polish vigorously , but lightly , with the leather . Any painted surface which , after successive cleaning , loses its gloss , will be improved by a coat of clear varnish . I28 I29 EASING DOORS AND DRAWERS The failure of a door to open easily , a drawer to run smoothly or a window sash to open readily , may be due to several reasons , but usually the stickiness is caused either by some portion of the woodwork having swollen ; or another part may be warped or shrunk or because of an excess of paint . Generally , the trouble can be cured by the use of a scraper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in a wooden handle , the Skarsten being a typical type . This scraper is easily handled and should form an item in the household equipment ; it can be used for smoothing floorboards , and for removing thick deposits of paint . To deal with a sticky door , first note the points where the door sticks . With a painted door a few strokes of the scraper may remove the excess , but rather than remove all the paint from the edge of the door , it is better to take a little off the door and the jamb . In the case of a door which drags on the floor , it is possible to effect a cure by extending the hook of the scraper and remove a few shavings , but if the door has dropped considerably , the better plan is to have the door taken down and the bottom edge planed off . The lower portion of the sides of a drawer can be scraped to reduce the width , but care should be taken to see if the trouble is not caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the drawer opening and note the condition of the strips of wood which are intended to allow the drawer to run easily . They may have worked loose ; if screwed , the screws should be tightened . If the runners have been glued in position , they should be cleaned and re-glued or screwed . Sticky window sashes are often caused by an excess of paint on the beading . A few strokes of the scraper will usually be sufficient ; care should be taken to scrape only the inside edges of the beading and only at the points where the sash appears to bind . 130 I3I RE-POLISHING WITH SHELLAC Although all the best work must be polished by hand , much of the preliminary bodying may be done with shellac varnish , applied with a brush . French polishing , once a lengthy operation , has now been superseded to a great degree by hard gloss which gives a highly glossed surface , but it is susceptible to stains and heat marks . The methods to be employed in removing stains and marks on polished surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to re-polish the renovated surface . It is often difficult to touch up small places with varnish without showing the newly varnished edges , which in some cases may be rather displeasing . Presuming that the best possible finish is desired , the most suitable treatment is french polish , that is shellac dissolved in methylated or denatured spirit similarly to the varnish , but instead of being brushed on it is applied with a pad . In this way portions of a surface can be re-polished without a visible edge . The polish can be obtained ready for use ; it is used by applying a few drops to a pad of cotton wool as shown , the moistened pad being covered with a fine linen rag , folded as indicated . Rub the pad lightly with a continuous circular motion , moistening the wool with fresh polish as it is worked out . A touch or so of linseed oil on the surface of the pad from time to time will ease the rubbing . When sufficiently polished , the polish inside the pad should be replaced gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surface of the pad will need a touch of oil to prevent it sticking . French polishing should be done in a warm room in stages rather than at one sitting . If two or three separate films of polish are rubbed on at intervals of a day or so , the result will be much more satisfactory . The most delicate part of the work lies in the finishing ; if too much spirit is used , all the previous polish may be removed instead of existing polish being hardened . 132 // There are many kinds of paint which may be easily applied by the housewife . But before any form of paint is used , the surface to which it is to be applied must be clean and , generally , it should be smooth . Too much trouble can not be taken to prepare the surface ; this is not only to make the actual painting easier , but to economise the material . Full instructions are given on page 128 , for cleaning paint ; these instructions should be followed , but it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the old paint before a new coat is applied . It is not always necessary , except in the case of exterior paint work , to clean down the surface to the bare wood , but to remove the top film and leave the surface smooth . Glasspaper or pumice powder applied with a felt pad will generally be sufficient . It is always economical to use paint of the best quality , it lasts longer and has a greater covering capacity . A good brush is essential ; those set in rubber are best . In applying paint , work downwards from top to bottom , pick up just sufficient paint to fill the brush and spread the paint evenly . Ordinary oil paint should be thoroughly worked , but enamels can be allowed to flow over the surface . In painting portions of a surface , the edges of the fresh paint should be merged into the old paint by stippling the edges with a dry brush . Cracks and small holes can be filled in with plastic wood and rubbed down when hard with glasspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paint ; the first one is allowed to dry and is then rubbed down smooth with glasspaper or pumice . Oil paints are those in which the pigment is suspended in a mixture of linseed oil and turpentine . Enamel paints are , as a rule , mixed with varnish . Lacquer and cellulose paints require special care : they dry rapidly and with a hard and generally a glossy surface . 134 // Given proper attention ; even the cheapest qualities of linoleum can be made to last a considerable time . Inlaid qualities , used either as a surround or as a complete floor covering , are practically everlasting , but worn places may occur under heavy chairs or tables , or an overlooked projecting nail underneath , or holes may result from a cinder from the fire . In the event of a portion of the lino being damaged , a little care in patching and in matching the pattern will effect an unnoticeable repair . A suggestion is given on the next page for a patch on a piece of lino with a parquet design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damaged portion follow the lines of the pattern as indicated in the lower corner by the thick lines . A new piece is placed underneath , marked out with chalk and then cut accurately to fit . It is a good plan when cutting lino , especially if the edges of a pattern can not be followed , to cut through the upper damaged layer as well as the new piece underneath , the latter being so placed that the pattern coincides . It is advisable , in this case , to drive a few brads through both layers so that the underpiece will not move while it is being cut . The brads can be pulled out afterwards with pincers . The best tool for the purpose is a specially shaped lino knife , but it is essential that the cutting edges should be kept as keen as possible . A good hone may be made by pasting a strip of fine emery cloth on a strip of wood . In use , draw the edge of the knife backwards and forwards , press firmly , but keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor with cement , but , as a rule , it will be found more convenient to use the special brads or sprigs which are made for the purpose . The brads should be driven in quite straight with the heads flush with the surface . Linoleum attached in this way can be removed easily . 136 // Minor repairs to carpets , such as frayed edges , can be carried out with little difficulty , but the replacing of portions actually worn out or caused by burns is not easy . Providing that the damaged portion is not more than two or three inches in area , new threads or tufts can usually be matched ; if the back of the fabric has been destroyed , a piece of hessian or coarse canvas should be sewn on underneath . With Wilton and Axminster patterns , the tufts are sewn into the back and trimmed off with scissors on a level with the existing pile . In the case of carpets that are worn in places at considerable distances apart , the best treatment , especially when they are made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remake the carpet with the least worn portions replacing those showing the most wear . Usually it is easier to cut up the carpet and make it up as a number of rugs , the edges being bound with a blanket stitch or with braid . Suggestions are given on the next page for the use of the blanket stitch for the cut edges of a pile carpet . In the case of closely woven carpets the stitch can be worked between every three or four tufts , but with a loosely woven Indian carpet , the stitches should be carried well into the edge at close intervals . The latter type of carpet does not lend itself to a braided edge , but braid can be used with advantage on Brussels , Wilton and Axminster carpets . It rarely happens that a carpet wears out entirely ; there are usually portions that have been protected by tables , chairs and other pieces of furniture and remain in good condition . These portions should be cut out , the edges bound , and used for bedside strips or for door slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of pile carpets covered at the back with leather or leather cloth make excellent foot muffs. 138 139
