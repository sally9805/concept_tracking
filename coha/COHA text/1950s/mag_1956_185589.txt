Striding buoyantly along San Francisco 's Eddy Street on a corner-to-corner , hand-kneading , quip-crackling campaign tour , Candidate Adlai Stevenson passed the California College of Chiropody and laughed at the yell from students : " Hi Adlai , how 's your feet ? " Shouted Stevenson : " I 'm going to come over there and lay down . " A member of Stevenson 's entourage murmured : " That 's the first time I ever heard you make a grammatical error . " Grinned Stevenson , whose Ivy League diction has been counted a political debit by his advisers : " I 've got orders to make one grammatical error a day . " Orders or no orders , Stevenson was acting like a candidate who enjoyed his role-and his day in San Francisco was one to remember . <P> Teetering on the Border . With the regularity of the rollers on nearby Stinson Beach , good news came pouring in to Stevenson that day . In the District of Columbia primary he had clobbered Estes Kefauver by a two-to-one margin and won all six convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 20 of the 52 half-vote delegates ( with 20 others uncommitted and the rest facing runoffs ) , and thus indicated that he can hold his own in the Deep South . In the Florida panhandle , Campaigner Kefauver , acting as though his shoes were really pinching as the critical May 29 primary drew closer , complained that he had been smeared by a spreading rumor that he favored calling out federal troops to enforce desegregation . <P> Prospecting in San Francisco for California 's June 5 primary . Stevenson stood on the kitchen balcony in the apartment of an unemployed Negro and spoke to a crowd in a parking lot . He perched on the rear platform of a cable car and shouted : " You have more happiness and gaiety here than any place in the world . " He teetered on the concrete border of a Union Square flower bed and praised " one of the greatest civilizations of the world , here on the rim of the Pacific by the Golden Gate . " He shook hands in a mixed Negro and Japanese neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Latin American community , sat at a green-topped table with 16 Chinatown moguls . <P> Beyond Deserts . That night , in a little Italian restaurant called La Pantera , he had the bubblingest , headiest experience of all . Outside La Pantera , a full block at the foot of Telegraph Hill had been roped off and was jammed with jostling , laughing , folk-singing Italians , who drank free wine from paper cups and made the night ring with their cheers at Stevenson 's simple statement : " I have come here to ask for your vote . " While four cops wrestled to hold back the crowd . Stevenson struggled into La Pantera for dinner with Owner Rena Nicolai and her employees . They pushed two bottles of Bardolino wine into his arms , then grabbed them back and started pouring . While a tenor sang La Donna mobile , Stevenson ate spaghetti and joined in a dozen toasts ( to Adlai , to Rena , to good times , etc . ) . <P> Returning to the outdoor platform , Stevenson was obviously touched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said emotionally . " I have often wondered why I went into politics . Now I know part of the answer . I never remember anything quite equal to the night on this street . "
