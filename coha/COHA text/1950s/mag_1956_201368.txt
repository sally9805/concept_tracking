Harvard and M.I.T. announced this week that the Atomic Energy Commission is treating them jointly to a 6 billion-volt electron synchrotron , which will be built in Cambridge . Cost : $6,500,000 . Its electrons will be steered around a circular vacuum chamber 236 ft. in diameter by 48 powerful magnets , each 11 ft. long , and they will be nudged to enormous speed by 16 radio-frequency circuits , each with the power of a full-scale television transmitter . <P> The Cambridge Electron Accelerator will not be as powerful as the proton synchrotron ( 25 billion to 30 billion electron volts ) that is being built at Brookhaven National Laboratory , New York , but the electrons that emerge from it will be the fastest particles created by man . Since electrons are much lighter than protons ( the mass of one proton equals 1,837 electrons ) , they must speed much faster than protons to pack the same punch . <P> The Cambridge electrons will move at almost but not quite the speed of light , which is the absolute speed limit of the universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time as a beam of light , it would be racing only five inches behind when the beam had made the circuit and reached its starting point . <P> Einstein 's law on the equivalence of mass and energy ( E = mc2 ) says that a particle which increases its speed must gain mass . In obeying Einstein , the Cambridge electrons grow very fat indeed . When they come out of the accelerator , their mass is about 12,000 times as great as when they went in.
