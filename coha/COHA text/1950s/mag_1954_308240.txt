Ohio 's senatorial campaign consists largely of Republican Candidate George Bender 's being here , there and everywhere ; whether that is good or bad for the G.O.P. , nobody can quite decide . While Democratic Senator Thomas Burke has plugged quietly away at building up organizational support , Bender 's baritone has boomed out in every Ohio gas station and crossroads store . Win or lose , by last week George Bender had proved that he knows only one way to run for public office : loudly . <P> Bender recently bounced out on the platform of Dayton 's Wayman African Methodist Episcopal Church , beamed down on perhaps 75 persons , and said hoarsely : " Do n't worry . I 'm not going to sing . " He read a couple of pages of his prepared text , stopped and asked : " You do n't want to hear this , do you ? " At best , the audience seemed indifferent , so Bender scrapped his script , began pacing around , pounding on the rostrum , on the walls and on a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Cleveland-born Bender : " We do n't hold meetings in Cleveland without singing and praying and shouting . " But he added : " I sing horribly . " Under Bender 's exhortations ( " What 's the matter with this audience ? This is n't a funeral parlor. " ) , the spectators began to warm up . Bender eyed them wistfully . Said he : " If my throat was in good shape , I 'd sing . " <P> At long last , Bender sat down , after nary an aria . The meeting 's chairman arose , tried to get in a few words , and was promptly interrupted . George Bender was sorry , but he wondered if someone would come forward to lead the singing . He waited all of two or three seconds for a volunteer , then lifted his arms-and his voice-in a rendition of God Be With You Till We Meet Again . It was a typical Bender performance . <P> Against such arial warfare , flat-toned <P> Democrat Tom Burke does not even try to compete-and he may not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopes to come out of them with enough organization votes to offset Bender 's advantage in the rural districts and Cincinnati 's Taftland . Burke dislikes to campaign . As the four-time mayor of Cleveland , he rarely had to try hard , and he much prefers to spend his evenings in cozy spots with a few old political cronies . His campaign speeches have been studded with such unexciting lines as " Canton has more replevins for merchandise on credit than any time in its history . " <P> Burke does , however , have one big fact in his favor . He is running under the aegis of Democratic Governor Frank Lausche , who appointed him to the Senate as Bob Taft 's replacement . And , in Ohio , the Lausche coattails are second to none-not even Dwight Eisenhower 's , to which former Taftman George Bender has clung with might and main . As of last week , Ohio looked like a coattail tossup.
