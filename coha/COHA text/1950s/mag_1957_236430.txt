AS last week 's riots in Warsaw testified ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , troubled , spirited Poland continues to writhe under the heel of Communist rule . But the heel has been lifted enough , since Wladyslaw Gomulka came to power a year ago , to permit the restoration to its proper place of Poland 's greatest treasure of religion and art . After 18 years ' absence , the famed Cracow altar , a huge , polychrome Gothic masterpiece carved out of linden wood in the 15th century , is back in its place in the red brick Church of Our Lady . <P> To welcome back their revered altar , 6,000 devout Poles thronged the 13th century Roman Catholic church and the small square outside one day in August while a solemn Mass of thanksgiving was offered . And for good reason . Cracow 's altar is not only the largest Gothic altar in Christendom , but the greatest masterpiece carved by Veit Stoss , the German sculptor who. along with his younger contemporaries Mathias Grunewald , Albrecht Drer and Lucas Cranach. brought the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Lyrical Composition . Sculptor Stoss was summoned to Cracow in 1475 when he was in his mid-30 's worked for 14 years carving the altar , which measures 45 ft. in height and 36 ft. in breadth and contains some 200 individual carved figures . The greatest labor and most consummate skill were obviously lavished on the shrine , or central panel ( see color page ) . There at the center of the drama is the dying Virgin Mary , falling with limp hands into the anguished arms of the attending St. James . The two figures , carved from one massive block of wood , have been called " one of the most lyrical compositions of the late Middle Ages . ' ' <P> The other foreground figures , all about 10 ft. tall , almost equal the central pair . Particularized , rather than idealized , they represent a triumphant manipulation of space , in gilded robes and meticulously formed figures , transcending the stiff , hierarchic form of the early Gothic style . The aging St. Peter reads a prayer , while another apostle offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , symbol of life . St. John , on the dying Virgin 's right , stricken with sorrow , raises his cloak . The outer figures , by their startled gaze and uplifted heads , point to the next act-the Assumption of the Virgin to her throne of glory beside Christ , surrounded by angels . <P> With Needle &; Knife . In 1940 the German army shipped the dismantled altar to Berlin to be stored like the treasure it is in the vaults of the Reichsbank . When the conquering U.S. Army moved into Germany , it found the crated altar in an air-conditioned vault in Veit Stoss 's native Nrnberg . General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower ordered it shipped back to Cracow . <P> There the Poles set out to restore the masterpiece to its original state . They injected chemicals into the figures to kill the termites that infested the wood , filled thousands of holes left by the insects , and then , with skillfully wielded knives , attacked five centuries of paint . Art Expert Marian Slonecki and 20 assistants labored for three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and gold , " the original bright Stoss colors that we wanted . "
