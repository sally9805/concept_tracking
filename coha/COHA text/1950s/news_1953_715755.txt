txt Slimmer government checks are making it harder for Korean veterans to get an education at federal government expense than it was for GIs of World War II . Evidence of this is a group of 100 Korean war veterans . at Boston University who organized last night to ask for more money . The government allotment ? as well as other factors ? is apparently causing a smaller pro .. portion of veterans to head back to school than after World War II . A national news magazine has reported that one in ten Korean war veterans is now in school  --  while more than half the World War II GIs used their education benefits at the peak of their enrollment . This raises the question whether it would be in the national interest to increase veterans ' allotments . Many veterans besides the BU group are hoping congressional action in their behalf will be taken . Major Test Still Ahead However , Veterans Administration officials in Washington say it is too early to make enrollment comparisons with World War II veterans . The peak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite some flaws , the law is operating with " reasonable general satisfaction , " in the opinion of Dr. James L. McCaskill , coordinator of the Na tional Conference for the Mobilization of Education . This fall 7,000 of the 61,000 Korean war veterans in Massachusetts are enrolled in college . There are 1,000 Korean war veterans at Boston University , 625 at Harvard , fewer than 50 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and about 50 at Tufts . Without assistance , only those who go to state universities , or who live at home and attend neighborhood schools , seem likely to get through the year on $990 . That is about what the returning soldier or sailor with no dependents can expect to finance a year 's schooling and living expenses . It is paid in installments of $110 during the school year . Cost Dwarfs Allotment Meanwhile minimum expenses at many universities have gone up this fall , A year at a top-ranking eastern college like Harvard , Yale , or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is expected to cost about $1,800 .

The United States Office of Education is carrying on a nationwide study now to see whether the lower government allotment is causing an abnormally large proportion to seek out low-tuition schools . At many large universities , such as Boston University , tuition ranges between $500 and $600 . Extra fees may add up to $50 . Most colleges are going out of their way to help the ex-soldiers and sailors with arrangements for payment of tuition in monthly allotments , student loans , and help finding part-time work . Too Stringent ? Hardest for the Korean veteran to understand is why he is receiving less government help than did the GI of World War II . The GI of World War II finds $500  --  and in some cases more  --  for tuition paid directly to the school and also receives $75 ( more if he has dependents ) monthly .

Among the veterans ' advisers at Boston area colleges , familiar with the faults of the older law , there is some feeling ex-servicemen have to make some financial effort for their education . However , more implied than voiced , there is a growing sentiment that the new law is a bit too stringent .
