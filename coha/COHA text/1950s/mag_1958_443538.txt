RDIDI 16 . WARREN , son of a Wisconsin farmer , was in his freshman year al Madison when the Confederacy rebelled . He enlisted in 1881 , served for , four years in cavalry and artillery , arid was eventually taken prisoner and shipped to Andersonrille . Here he survived for 162 days under conditions which he describes with grim humor . This account was written for , hat new published in , TUE BATTLES sun LEADERS OF THE CIVIL WAR . Mr. Warren heed to a ripe old age in Haine , where he screed as mill manager of the S.D.-Warren Paper Company . IT WAS on the first of June , 1864 , that a division of troops left Memphis , Tennessee , under command of General Sturgis . Why he was chosen for the co and , not having previously been co-nected mmwith the service El our region , I do nnot know , unless it teas to give him a chance to distinguish himself . Perhaps he went out solely to find that rebel , General Forrest , in which case he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The battery to which I belonged had been lying idle at Memphis ever since returning from veteran furlough , some two or three months previous , and the dullness of camp life had settled down upon us . Only a section of our battery was to accompany the Sturgis Expedition and , as I had been ap . pointed orderly sergeant a short time before this , I had to beg for a chance to go with the old gun detachment with which I had served SO long . Evidently , I did not know what I was asking Mr. We scent out with flying colors , infantry , cavalry , and artillery , and even a brass band . On June seventh , we first fell in with the rebels under the irrepressible Forrest , and there were frequent skirmishes for two or three days , but still We continued on our way . On the tenth , the rebels made a stand at a place about ten miles from the station of Guntown on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad , in northern Mississippi . The fighting was begun early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Waring . Our guns arrived at the scene of action about noon , at which time a considerable force of cavalry and artillery had gathered to oppose the rebels , who showed signs of taking the offensive , the fear of which caused us great uneasiness as the infantry had not yet arrived . And , right here , let me , as one who has been familiar with all branches of the service , say a word for the men whom we , as cavalry or artillery , dubbed " flat feet " and " dust beaters " and often ridiculed on the march . The cavalry could get around and find the enemy more quickly than the infantry , and , finding them , could and ordinarily did get away more quickly still . The artillery could make a big show and a tremendous noise , and at least let the enemy know where they were ; but when it ce to honest , close , and deadly work , both were wamilling to stand by in silence and take off their hats to the men who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in the original material , but in the experience and training each had received . And so on this occasion , when the infantry , who had been hurried forward under the burning sun of an intensely hot day , arrived at the scene of action ? as played-out , bedraggled , and unwarlike a set of men as you can imagine ? see felt a sense of relief . The cavalry fell back and mounted their horses , while the rebels , knowing from experience the difference between the infantry rifles and the cavalry carbines , or rather in the mettle of the men behind them , prudently withdrew for a time . Our troops continued to arrive , and so did the rebel reinforcements , I presume , for about four o'clock of the summer afternoon they renewed the attack . The battle was short and sharp . Our line was soon broken , and the rebels , following up their advantage , threw our forces into rout and confusion . General Sheridan , or many another officer of less distinction , would still have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ; but Sturgis seemed to have important business calling him back to Memphis , and so led the retreat in a masterly maner . Our wagon train , n beautifully parked , fell an easy prey to the enemy ; much of the artillery was left on the field ; and the flushed and excited rebels poured a merciless her into the flanks and rear of our retreating troops . ALL night long the retreat continued , and morning found us at the town of Ripley , where we halted for a brief rest , At this time my gun was the only one remaining in the whole division , and We looked forward to a hard day 's work ; but as see moved out of the town the rebels soon drove us from the highway , and shortly after we came to a stream which we could not ford with the gun , so , after spiking it and throwing the ammunition into the river , the cannoneers mounted the team horses as far as they would serve , and we hastened on . Being now equipped only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effect a safe retreat . I was well mounted on a magnificent black horseWhiCh had been selected from a corral of captured horses before we left Memphis and which proved of rare mettle for strength and endurance ; but whensome of my comrades who were not mounted asked for a chance to ride behind , I preferred to keep my horse in good condition , and so let one take him for a time , while I went on foot . It was a bad move for me , as I went on foot much longer than 1 intended . I walked along with some of my comrades behind the troops , and , as the road was just wet enough to beat down smooth under the tramping feet of the infantry , I took off my boots and carried them in my hands ? another unfortunate move , as events proved . All this time , the rebel cavalry was hovering on our rear and flank , making a dash whenever an opportunity offered . Walking along with us was a motley mass of men composed of dismounted cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each looking out for himself . Close in our rear was the guard of New Jersey cavalry . Soon the rebels made a dash , and the , ffirseymen , true to their training and instincts , broke and ran right through our swarm of poor noncombatants , making up for their want of bravery by their vigorous and energetic warnings to us to get out of the way , or the rebels would get us . For a time I had kept pace with the cavalry , when a mule with an empty saddle shot past me . Now , I had never exactly fancied a mule , but I seas taken with a hankering for that particular animal and , dropping my boots , I went for him for all I was worth . The mule , however , evidently thought he could carry out his part of the retreat better with his saddle unoccupied . I had almost captured him , when he managed to illustrate the general principle that mules are very onsartain critters and mighty apt to fly up behind . By this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel bullets were spattering around in a very careless way . I got behind a tree a moment to take breath and consider the situation . A connoted rebel galloped up and , halting close by my tree , began firing with his revolver at the krseymen , who were retreating up an open slope in front . I could have laid my hand upon him as he sat there in his saddle . So intent was he in his work that he did not see me at first , and I hoped he would empty his revolver before he made my acquaintance ; but his eye caught sight of me and , with a startled exclamation , he promptly covered me with the aforesaid Navy and called on me to surrender . " Any Navy ? " " No . " " Any watch ? " " Pocketbook ? " But he could n't tell me to " get Out of them boots , " and either forgot or thoughtfully omitted the next order in the manual : " Get out from under that hat . " The Confederacy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and hoots and hats were in great demand . My captor tapped the breast of my jacket with his foot and asked , " What is that ? " I drew forth the roll hook , which I have now and which contains all the notes I kept of my visit to the Confederacy ; this he rapidly looked over and , at my request , handed back . " What you got in your trousers pockets ? " was the next question . I brought forth all my valuables , consisting of a chunk of soap and a silk handkerchief , and these Ito promptly confiscated . In my chase for the mule , I had got a considerable distance away from the road , and no one else was close by us when this arrangement of terms was going on ; but many other rebels had come up , and now that our private business was arranged , my captor called out to an officer , " Hello , Captain , got a Yank . Will trot him out . " And your humble servant was accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told a boy to take me to the rear . The boy to whom was assigned this duty ought to have been at home attending a primary school , so far as years and size were concerned , and yet the easy unconcern with which he conducted me around won both my ire and admiration : mounted on an old , white horse and armed only with a revolver and a cavalry saber without a scabbard , which he had picked up on the way , he chatted away in the most social manner but did not forget to keep me covered with his revolver . We were constantly meeting the rebels coming up in squads and detachments , and before long came to a sort of rendezvous , where were gathered a considerable number of prisoners . Since I was now fairly a prisoner and free from any immediate danger or responsibility , there was a sort of novelty in looking over the men who had captured me , I had seen rebels before , but circumstances ordinarily rendered it necessary to look at them over the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages for critical examination I now possessed . Once before in the heat of action , I had fallen into their hands , and had occasionally been with groups of prisoners captured by us ; so I was not surprised to find that they did n't have horns , and wet-6 withal very fair specimens of humanity . I doubtless saw the rebels at this time under the most favorable circumstances ( for them ) . They were elated with their victory , and only their effective working material was in sight ; but the general quality , enthusiasm , and earnestness of those I did see , their worn-down and serviceable appearance , the ease with which they had overcome us with probably inferior numbers , and the persistence with which they followed up their advantage , all provoked my admiration , and for the first time since the beginning of the war I began to be doubtful of the ultimate result , fearing we could never conquer such men as these . I soon learned , however , that this was more than a fair average of the rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebels , and his mode of warfare ? in which he would penetrate the Union lines as far as possible and , finding himself unable to retreat , disband his force , allowing each to make his escape as best he could , armed or disarmed , and reassemble at some point within the Confederate fines ? made it easy for all who were not of true mettle to withdraw from the service . I do not think a more effective body of troops was ever gathered than Forrest 's raiders . WMA ED back to Guntown over the ground We had lost . There was the wearisome ride in overfilled freight cars to Meridian , Mississippi , and from there to Selma , Alabama . Then we went up the Tombigbee River in a wheezy old steamboat ( there were several hundred of us , all told ) which we found was loaded with corn and which we partially unloaded . It was Sunday when I was captured , and Sunday came round again before ? we drew near the stockade of Andersonville , or Camp Sumter , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ere this of the sufferings of our men in rebel prisons , but Andersonville had not then become as it has since , a synonym of suffering ; and , worn out as we were by our long march , fighting , exposure , and privation , we all longed for our journey to end . I had pictured a camp among woods and streams , where quiet and rest would bring as some amends for short rations and removal from friends . Through ' the drenching rain , we marched to the stockade . The renowned Wire , mounted on his white horse , met us with his guards before we entered the gate and counted us off into detachments , putting one of our own sergeants in charge of each . All commissioned officers had been separated from as at Macon , as none were allowed at Andersonville , the more completely to break up our organization . As we passed through the gate , we emerged into a noisy , bustling crowd , the sight of which I shall never forget . I had thought that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . hear later ? news from the war and the North , but each man seemed intent on his own business , and paid little heed to the hungry fellows who had come in to share their lot . It was just ration time , and a brisk trade was going on in the way of exchange ; some had a mouthful of bacon impaled on a such which they were trying to sell or exchange for bread . The size of this ration would have appeared ridiculous had it not been for our pressing need . The thought that we were expected to live with such a contemptible bit of meat served to us once a day did not seem at all funny at the time . The crowd about the gate was so dense that one could hardly find standing room , let alone a chance to sit upon the ground . Except for the street , which was kept clear by the daily trips of the ration wagons , the space was all taken up by little tents or shelters , mostly made of blankets , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a place where I might sit down and take in the situation , 1 found that the whole space inside the stockade was a dense mass of humanity , excepting the swamp , which was absolutely uninhabitable , deep , slimy , and reeking with filth . Finding a little space not quite so densely packed , 1 sat down on the muddy ground , thoroughly sick and disheartened . Everyone was looking out for himself , and although we were companions in misery . there was not one to speak a kindly or encouraging word . How one could long exist in such a mass of filth and misery , aside from the question of scanty rations , I could not see . I returned to my comrades , and after our rations were served we lay down blanketless on the sodden , reeking earths and slept as best we could . Tim bull pen was enclosed by a stockade made of hewn , hard-pine timbers about fifteen feet high , which , although set closely , were not fastened to each other to prevent tunneling , almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside of this stockade , at convenient intervals , were the sentry boxes , or platforms , on which stood the guards looking over the top of the stockade . Inside , and about fifteen feet distant , was the famous dead line . Between this and the stockade no one was allowed to step , thus insuring a clear space fifteen feet in width , all around the prison . This dead line was right enough in its way , being only a necessary precaution and as such in use in our own prisons . The thing to be condemned was the shooting of men who inadvertently got over the line without a challenge , which did not seem to be required . The prison pen , or bull pen , as it was commonly called by its occupants , contained at this time about twenty-four acres , at least one third of which was swamp , almost impassable , much less habitable . Through this ran a brook , which afforded water for our use , but later many wells were dug and springs cropped out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time could not have been less than 30,000 , and this was constantly increasing . The rebels were busy enclosing an additional space of about eight acres on the north end , which was completed and opened a fete days after our arrival , when we were assigned by detachments to definite lots which we were expected to occupy and on which we answered to roll call each morning . Previous to the opening of this addition , we had to shift for ourselves , and I am correct in saying that the prison pen did not contain room enough outside the swamp for all the men to lie down at the same time . After the opening of this addition , it never again became so crowded , for death almost kept even pace with the captures . Our rations at this time , I think , must have consisted officially of one pound of corn meal and one-fourth pound of fresh meat or bacon ; but this seas so depleted by the swarm of extra-ration men fed from the common stock that , when it reached us , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces . Of corn meal , there was usually enough , as many men who had the scurvy could hardly eat it at all . This ration was issued in various ways : one week we would receive mush , the next week , corn bread , and the next , raw meal , which we could cook to suit ourselves . Wood was very scarce and valuable and , when raw rations were issued , it gave as much trouble to secure enough , although to one who never tried it , c the small amount necessary to cook a pot of mush would be surprising . Meat , we always ate raw , partly from necessity and partly from the idea that it would , at least in the case of fresh beef , go further in that way . As we settled down to our prison life , the drawing of the rations was the one event of the day , and the hawking about of rations by those who wanted to trade made things lively and did much to keep up our spirits . A considerable trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the con nivance of the rebel officers , and those who had money could buy many luxuries , but at fearful prices : good onions or Irish potatoes would sell for 30 cents to $1.00 each , and even at that price found eager purchasers on account of their value in preventing scurvy . The only useful trades in the prison , besides that of sutler , were the barbers , who would cut hair , or shave , at the standard price of one cent ; the coopers , who made much-needed small pails or tubs cut of the roots dug up from the swamp , often with no tools but the blade 133 of an old case knife ; and the brewers , who made a kind of sour swill , termed beer , from the spare corn meal . A drink of this , plain , from a tin cup sold for 5 cents ; if drunk from a glass tumbler , as a reminder of better days , 10 cents was the price ; colored with bloodroot , it seas worth 15 ; sweet-ened with molasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowning glory of soda to make it foam made it worth 25 . This drink was mild enough , so far as having any intoxicating char-acter , and did , I suppose , some service in keeping off the scurvy . Tin two vices that most afflict mankind in ordinary stages of society are intemperance and licentiousness , and it is very natural to suppose that if these could be set aside , a great gain would be made in the happiness and well-being of mankind . But here was a community where prohibition had full sway , and from the lives of whose 30,000 members the temptation or opportunity for yielding to these vices was utterly cut out ; but , as we.read that in the days before the Flood the earth was filled with violence , even so it was here . The evil nature in men 's hearts , unrestrained by moral principle , will crop out , and here , finding no other vent , took delight in deeds of vioknee and murder . Gambling , too , was common , and all day long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap the money of the unwary would be paraded along the street . The policy of recruiting the service by the payment of large bounties had borne fruit in the horde of bounty jumpers and deserters . In some states , the prison doors were opened to all who would enlist . Was it any wonder then that the prison contained many men who had sought capture rather than meet the consequences of their acts in our own lines , and here carried on their work of plunder , and even murder , from sheer wantonness ? There was no law or tribunal to punish offenses , and for a time these men had sway . Almost every morning , someone would be found with his throat cut , and I have seen men knocked down and robbed in broad daylight , with hundreds looking on not daring to assert themselves against the banded violence of the raiders , as they were called . The rebel authorities had been appealed to in vain to stop this state of affairs , but paid no attention , and so things went on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the eye of Wirz that brought about a change . The older residents of the prison had ere this banded together for self-protection , but could take no active steps to punish the raiders . Sometimes , though , a raider met his match . Among the Western regiments were many Indians , and , one day , one was brought in with some Wisconsin troops that had been captured . As he entered the stockade , worn out with his journey , the Indian laid down on the ground and went to sleep . A raider caught sight of a watch and chain , of which the rebels had forgotten to relieve the Indian ( an oversight which the raider set about to correct ) , and , bending over the man , proceeded to loosen it ; but the Indian 's sleep was not very sound , his savage instincts were quick , his knife handy , and that raider went raiding no more . One morning , however , a company of the rebel soldiers marched into the prison , and the order was circulated that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered up . Under cover of the rebel guns , our men organized police squads , armed with whatever implements they could lay hands on , and arrested everyone against whom there was any suspicion and turned them over to the care of the rebel guards , who sent them outside for safekeeping . Hundreds were arrested , and a court was promptly organized among the prisoners for their trial , the rebels affording them facilities for the prosecution of the work and putting the minor sentences into execution , but not interfering otherwise with their action . Many of those arrested were set at liberty , and others sentenced to punishments according to the crimes of which they were found guilty ; but six of the ring/caders found guilty of murder were sentenced to be hanged . At first , the rebels seemed loath to allow this order to be executed , no doubt fearing that their action might be misunderstood by our government , and a considerable time elapsed before we knew what the result would be . In the meantime , a police government was or-ganized among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison , proved effective . One morning a load of lumber was brought inside the stockade , with which a gallows was constructed , and about four o'clock in the afternoon the rebels brought in the condemned men , and after an officer had read an official statement of the situation , released them ; but this was only a matter of form , as the police officers of the prison stood by to seize them . The rebel force at Andersonville was small compared with the number of men guarded , and they always seemed fearful of any concert of action among the prisoners ; so on this occasion the whole rebel force was in line outside the stockade , and a light battery was drawn up to command the gallows and its surroundings , plainly visible on the other side of the slope , outside the stockade . A dense and deeply interested mass of men had crowded around the scene . Everything was in readiness , the six culprits were marched to the platform , and the nooses were slipped over their heads , amid the breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I re ember watching them from a near post of obsermvation , all strong , well-fed men , and such as might well be feared for their physical power the starved , worn-out inhabitants of the stock-ade ; but here they were , n , in our power . ow Suddenly one of them , the last in the row , broke from his attendants and sprang from the platform , right out onto the heads of the dense crowd , so dense that he seemed to bound along with strong , desperate strides , for rods , before he touched the ground . The sudden commotion caused by this in a crowd which had watched in breathless silence quickly attracted the attention of the rebels . The infantry were called to attention , and at the battery the cannoneers stepped in to load . A sudden fear seized the crowd , so quiet before , and it surged back , each one only anxious to get out of the range of that terrible battery , mindful of the havoc cannon shot would make in such a dense mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confusion ; but the rebels bravely held their fire , and the men at the gallows stood by the remaining convicts . The escaped convict foolishly undertook to cross the swamp to the other side of the prison , only to be captured by a line of police stationed on the opposite bank , who led him back to the gallows . The noose was adjusted , the black caps pulled down , the word given , and five of the raiders dangled at their ropes ends . The cords with which the men were hanged were not made , it seems , of the traditional hemp , but of good Confederate cotton which , to the sixth an , as to the Confederacy , proved unequal to its remquirements . For the ringleader ? known as Moseby , from the rebel guerrilla ? heavier than the others with sin , it may be , broke his rope and fell to the ground . The man who officiated as hangman was known as " Limber Jim , " and the story is told that , when he first entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Moseby reached the ground , Limber Jim grabbed him . " I have stood my chance , " said Moseby . " No , " responded Jim , " the rope around your neck cost use $176 , and I will hang you as long as I can tie a knot in it " He tied the knot , and it held . TIE great disease of the prison was the scurvy , which is not , as its name would indicate , a skin disease , nor necessarily one arising from uncleanliness . Another disorder , hardly less common , and more terrible in its effects , was a disease arising in the feet of the men from contact with the satu- rated , poisonous earth of the swamp . Owing to the mulishness of the mule of which I have told you , I was barefooted when I entered the prison , and soon was attacked by an ulcer on the bottom of my right foot which grew worse . The usual result of ulcers of this sort I well knew from what I had seen and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amputation would follow , only to make another wound for a fresh attack of gangrene . I have known men to suffer three amputations in rapid succession , all performed in the old way : the patient was strapped to a table without anesthetics , and , need I add , usually died in consequence . It became evident that I must leave my corn-rades and go to the hospital , to which at this time it was almost impossible to gain admittance . It was not a question of need , but of room , no more being admitted than death made room for day by day ; and although the deaths daily averaged more than 100 , out of 2000 patients , so large was the source from which to draw new patients that but few of those needing treatment ever received it . Making a desperate effort , I at last succeeded in getting to the sick yard early one morning , was examined and admitted . The sick yard was just outside the gate , and itself surrounded by a strong fence . Few were admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these only at the will of the surgeons . The yard seas divided into wards corresponding , I think , to the wards in the hospital . One other manses admitted in the same ward with Inc . It was early morning when we entered the sick yard , and there we remained all day , or until late in the afternoon . It was a bright sunny day in the latter part of August , and we lay in the sand , in the shade of the stockade , until the sun crawled around and made our situation uncomfortable . Then I crawled across the yard , on my hands and knees , and lay down in the little patch of shade made by the awWing where the surgeon stood when examining patients ; my comrade for the day followed me , also on his hands and knees . I do not remember that any word was spoken between us , and who he seas , I know not see had been companions in suffering and now hoped for relief . The little shelter afforded us scanty shade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remember the happy , peaceful expression on the ms face as he folded up his coat for a pillow and an'lay down in the sand to sleep . For myself , in spite of pain and hunger , memory recalls few pleasanter afternoons than the one in which I lay by my sleeping comrade , enjoying the pure air and gazing through the cracks of the fence into the quiet and beauty of the outer world . The long road had turned , and whatever might be ahead , the bull pen with its horrors was behind ; and , although I knew nothing of the hospital , from which , it was said , none ever returned to the stockade , nor what might be in store for me there , hope again revived . When water was brought around , I took a cup from my companion 's haversack and , after taking a drink , filled it for him when Ire should awake ; but all through the bright sunny afternoon , he slept peacefully on ; he was nearer the end of his troubles than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the hospital , I turned to waken him , but he was dead . Like one who gathers up the ammunition of his fallen comrade to help him in the fight , I hastily removed his haversack with the battered tin cup , and went my way . The hospital was only a camp in the woods near the stockade , through which flowed a stream joining the one by the stockade a little below . It was surrounded by a strong fence , around which paced the sentinels , but escape from its bounds was not nearly so hopeless a task as it was from the stockade . It had been laid out in streets and wards , and simple tents , or rather flies of canvas , stretched among the grateful shade of the oaks which had been left standing . On a rude bank or platform , raised some two feet above the sand under one of these , in the company of six or seven others , I spent the remainder of my prison life ; for , although my foot began to mend at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never returned to the stockade . With more room , pure air , better water , and better , though not more abundant , food , I was thankful for the change . My bcrth was next to the outside one on the bank , and beside me , during the time I spent there , six others were brought from the stockade , one after another , to remain but a short time and then beearried out to add another foot to the long trench , which steadily grew day by day . Every morning along the street there would be a single rank of men , lying straight and stiff , with an old soldier 's cap placed reverently over each face to keep the light from the sightless eyes . Somebody 's hope , somebody 's dependence , waiting for detail to carry him out the gate on a stretcher . For one thing we must give the rebels credit : for as decent a burial and as complete a record as were possible under the circumstances . Our food in the hospital was mainly rice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w. better than corn meal . Later , to-ward the last of my stay , a ration of one spoonful of wheat flour was issued daily to each man , and the business of making bread , or rather rolls ; sod-. dcnly became a regular trade among the convalescents . Our surgeons , in the main , did what they could for us , with their limited advantagesand few medicines . The surgeon in chief was a faithful man and was afterward rewarded by our government . I think the prison would have afforded an interesting field of study for a medical student , showing the different types of physical nature under adverse circumstances . Some men would dry up to meet the circumstances . All superfluous flesh would vanish , and the skin , dry and close , would become as dark as a Negro 's ; the hair would become kinky by neglect and exposure to the smoke of the hard-pine knots , with which the cooking was done , and there were many white men who could hardly be told from mulattoes . Another feature made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth of the prisoners , which has been often remarked ; whether this arose from the absence of anything deleteri-ous in our food , or from the scouring properties of the corn meal , or the sand , which pervaded everything , or was , as in the case of the Negro , only apparent by reason of the darkened skin , I know not . This class of mummy men looked as though they would last forever ; but not so with all . I could not , if I would , depict to you the misery of this place , which has left its record in the 13,000 graves made in the short nine months of its existence . THE beautiful autumn weather was rapidly passing , and already the colder nights made us fear the coming winter . About this time there occurred an event which has always had a deep interest to me. and which I have never seen recorded . The Republican and Democratic conventions for nominating candidates for the presidency had both been held , and the result was known to us before our capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan . The issue was plain . A vote for Lincoln was a vote for the prosecution of the war to the bitter end ; a vote far McClellan was a vote for compromise and peace . The rebels understood this , and no question was more frequently asked by them than our opinion of the result of the election . They saw the inevitable end , and hoped for better terms than could be made with the existing administration . Lincoln had gained a strong hold upon the hearts of the soldiers , and his name was a tower of strength . There is no power so strong as that of personal loyalty . Any really successful military commander will rely as much upon the soldier 's loyalty to him as to the country or cause , and he is an unwise leader who neglects this power over his men . And sowe , who now delight to honor the memory of our first martyred president , will never know how much we owed to that strong , quaint , rugged personality . What Christ is to the Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who fought for the Union , In almost any organization in the field , in spite of McClellan 's great popularity as a commander , Lincolnwould have received an overwhelming majority . But herr was an aggregation of soldiers who had long been removed from the knowledge of the progress of the political campaign and from active participation in the war , and all their circumstances called loudly for peace . A more representative body of men could not have been gathered , coining as they did from all parts of our land and from all conditions of society ; and now that election was approaching , the rebels were deeply interested in ascertaining the political sentiments of the 1200 men still remaining in Andersonville hospital ? no doubt thinking that a vote for Lincoln under these circumstances represented little but clean grit . Under their direction , huge campfires were sometimes built in the camp , around which the men would congregate in the cool autumn evenings and discuss the question ; and from a rude platform , our stump speakers would hold forth in true Western style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant ; the Lincoln men were quiet and determined . When election day came , orders were issued that all should be in their regular places at certain hours . Printed , ballots were distributed by the rebels , bearing then ames of Lincoln and McClellan , and the ballot box was passed around , and the vote counted under their close surveillance . It was a constituency that ncnt no representative ; no returns were ever made , and there was no need that the vote should be counted to decide the result ; but I think no more telling blow was ever given the tottering Confederacy , or a greater honor ever conferred upon President Lincoln , than the clear majority of 400 votes out of those cast by 1200 worn-out , starved , rot. , men in Andersonville hospital . Soon after this event , a rumor of exchange , more plausible than the former ones , was about , and one day a squad of rebel officers and surgeons , accompanied by a clerk , passed rapidly from tent to tent , selecting men . I promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather worst , foot foremost ; it was acceptable , and my name and description were recorded . A day or two later , early in them orning , the call blew , and hastily snatching my old blanket and saying good-by ( if so it might prove ) , I made for the gate . My name and description were all right , and with a heart full of thankfulness , I hobbled through the gate , out of which so many of my comrades had beencarried feet foremost . We were marched to the station , loaded intocars , and with the notable Wirz to we us off and wish us good succe. in getting home , started on our way . At nightfall we were again marched through the stockade of Mill prison , where we remained a few days , and then proceeded on our way to Savannah . At Savannah , on the early morning of another eventful Sunday , we were marched through the town to the wharf , where we signed the parole and were put on board transports and taken down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fleet lay . Toward noon , we came in sight of our old flag floating from the masthead of one of our transports . We had had nothing to eat since leaving Mill the previous afternoon , and the night had been rainy , so We were all wet to the skin , and the cold wind from the salt water chilled us through . In this condition , we were kept waiting during the long afternoon while the preliminaries were being arranged , and the report crept around that there was some hitch in the proceedings and that the whole lot was to be returned to Savannah . More than one prisone to the guards with the avowed purpose of throwing himself overboard should this be attempted . Just about dark , however , our transport steamed alongside the George Scary , and we were counted over the rail . The long cabin , made bare for our reception , was fragrant with the aroma of boiling coffee , and after the usual delay , it was served to us with old-time hardtack . Our long imprisonment was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag , and warmed and fed . The loyal North and home were before us . Joyfully we sang far into the night the long-neglected , almost-forgotten songs of former days . Many an eye was bright with hope that night that never opened on the scenes of home , and many a voice was raised in song that never was heard by loved ones , for death pursued no still , and all along the ocean path and in the cemetery at Annapolis were laid many who had been paroled too late . A few days after , we were transferred to the steamer Baltic , in which we were conveyed to Annapolis . Here again , onanother Sunday , the lighters met us in the blue waters of Chesapeake Bay and landed us at the wharf of the Old Naval School , used as a hospital during the war . Here , with care and comfort , I rapidly recuperated . My commutation money was paid me ( $40.50 ) , the price of 162 days ' starvation at 25 cents per day , in good , new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my new soldier pants with the mental exclamation , " There , old fellow , is a debt you owe your stomach , and you pay it , every cent "
