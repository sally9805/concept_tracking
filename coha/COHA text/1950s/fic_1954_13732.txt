WILMA on . Wilma is a small town girl from Oklahoma who has been in New York less than a year . She is plain looking in a very attractive way . There is a special cleanliness about her in body , clothes , and spirit . And a subdued intensity . She speaks with a drawl that is a mixture of the south and west . She is in the room alone waiting . It is late at night . The radio is going . Bell at the outside door rings . WILMA ( surprised - looks out from the side of the drawn shade at the window down stage . Then she goes out the apartment door into the hall to the outer door . Returns , followed by PEGGY . ) PEGGY is a pretty girl  --  dressed up and made up , not too overdone , but cheap . ( Wilma comes directly into the room . Peggy hesitates on the threshold ) WILMA ( turning ) Come in , Peggy . What 's the matter ? PEGGY Straight that Garry is n't home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told me not to come any more . WILMA I wondered why you had n't been around . PEGGY ( resentfully ) Said he did n't want you dirtied up . p. 3 WILMA I can take care of myself . Sit down . PEGGY ( sitting ) I ca n't stay . I just took a chance . I thought he 'd be out roaming tonight . WILMA ( on the defensive ) Why did you think that ? PEGGY Lost his job ai n't he ? WILMA How did you know that ? PEGGY In my racket you hear everything . WILMA How did you hear this ? PEGGY I got him the job did n't I ? WILMA I did n't know that . PEGGY Well I did . The guy that fixed it for me comes to see me whenever his wife goes to visit her folks . Now she 's gone again so I saw him last night . He told me Garry 'd quit . WILMA It was n't any job for Garry . PEGGY There is n't any job for Garry . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing  --  his own sister ! PEGGY That sister business  --  it 's all hooey . I never liked him . WILMA Why not ? p. 4 PEGGY He 'd never let me  --  me or ma either  --  always pulling away  --  being by himself  --  bumming . WILMA He kept that job ever since we were married . PEGGY ( disdainfully ) And how long is that ? WILMA Three months ! Almost . PEGGY Well - that 's longer than he over stuck anything . But now  --  he 's quit . WILMA It was n't good enough for him ! PEGGY Why not ? Why should n't he load trucks if you wrap packages ? You 're still wrappin om are n't you ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY And payin the bills ! WILMA For the time being . PEGGY You 're in for life , kid . WILMA He 'll get another job soon ! PEGGY Has n't got one yet . WILMA It 's not easy to get a job when you 've been in a boy 's form and all that ! PEGGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WILMA He 's looking all the time . That 's what he 's doing tonight  --  looking . p. 5 PEGGY ( impatient ) If he gets it he wo n't stick it . WILMA Why do you keep saying that ? PEGGY Garry never stuck a job in his life . Just gone from one to another . Or loafed . My mother worked her hands to the bone for him . What did it get her ? Trouble  --  nothing but trouble . WILMA He was just a kid then . PEGGY He 's just a kid yet . He 'll never grow up . What did you marry him for anyway ? WILMA For love ! PEGGY Love ! What 's love ? WILMA I do n't know  --  but it is . PEGGY Well I know . It 's a racket  --  like all the rest . WILMA You do n't know anything about it . PEGGY He 's good looking of course  --  but  --  WILMA He 's wonderful looking . PEGGY That do n't get you nothing . I 'd rather take a homely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're more generous - and kind of grateful  --  the saps. ( looking around restlessly ) Got anything to drink ? p. 6 WILMA Got some coke - and some milk . PEGGY No whiskey ? WILMA No . PEGGY What 's the matter  --  do n't Garry drink any more ? WILMA Not if I can help it . PEGGY So that 's what you married him for  --  to reform him ! WILMA Well  --  if it was  --  I have . He 's kept straight ever since . PEGGY That has n't been too long . WILMA He only drinks to show off . PEGGY That 's why he does everything . It 's like he was afraid inside-so he acts big to pretend he ai n't . He 'll go back sure as hell . WILMA No ! PEGGY Listen , Wilma  --  nobody can change nobody . We 're just the way we are . And that 's mostly no good . Garry 's surely no good . WILMA Garry 's not no good ! He 's one of the best boys I ever knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILMA You do n't know anything about him  --  really . I could tell you something that would open your eyes . p. 7 PEGGY Go ahead  --  tell me . WILMA I 'm not going to . PEGGY Why not ? WILMA Because you would n't understand it . You 'd just laugh and jeer like you do at everything . PEGGY O.K. ( pause ) Give me a coke  --  will yuh  --  if that 's the best you can do . ( WILMA off inner door  --  back with coke . ) PEGGY ( takes out cigarette  --  looks around the place disdainfully - then as Wilma returns ) Listen  --  Wilma  --  did you know about Garry when you married him ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY Everything ? WILMA Yes . He told me all about himself . PEGGY That he started stealing when he was n't hardly eight  --  and WILMA Fruit from a dago fruit stand  --  what 's that ?  --  just a little boy playing . PEGGY Well it was n't long after that , he was workin at it  --  working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subway . He and another kid just about lived down there  --  hanging around  --  waiting to roll some guy asleep on a bench . Then he played the lockers in the Grand Central and  --  WILMA What does that mean ? PEGGY Oh - palm a key on some dame putting her suit case in  --  then get it out  --  see what he 'd find to sell - a couple of times he made a big score  --  once jewelry  --  they got him for that  --  then he started stealing cars  --  and then  --  WILMA He did n't do any of that really to steal ! PEGGY Why then ? WILMA Just for the kicks ! He told me all about it  --  everything ! PEGGY That 's mostly what he does everything for  --  kicks  --  but it 's stealing just the same  --  ai n't it ? WILMA No ! There 's a difference ! PEGGY What ? WILMA ( desperately ) He was only a boy then ! Without any one to help him or  --  PEGGY He had me  --  and ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grown up  --  and p. 9 PEGGY He 'll never grow up  --  I tell you . Why waste your life on him ? Like ma did !  --  He is n't your child ! WILMA Yes he is  --  he 's my child . PEGGY What rot  --  you 're only a little bit older than he is - both kids ! WILMA That is n't it . PEGGY Throwing your life away on him ! Doing up packages all day  --  coming back here  --  cooking a hamburger - then sitting around alone ! Do n't you ever want a little fun ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY And money ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY Well then . Listen , Wilma  --  I want you to come out with me tonight . WILMA Where ? PEGGY On a date . WILMA What kind of a date ? PEGGY What kind ? WILMA Yes - there ' all kinds of dates . PEGGY Not in my book - there 's only one - well - will yuh ? WILMA No . PEGGY I know that would be the answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PEGGY Because you are a good kid  --  and I 'm sorry for you . WILMA Keep your sorry . PEGGY Do n't get sore . I ai n't asking you to do anything you do n't want  --  only Miss Clair phoned and me if I could n't get another nice girl for a double date  --  all her girls are working tonight and  --  WILMA Who 's Miss Clair ? PEGGY She 's the woman who gets me the business . She has a swell house but I 'm not classy enough to live there yet . I 'm just on call . WILMA You mean you give her part of the money the men give you ? PEGGY She gives me part . WILMA Oh Peggy  --  it 's all just awful ! PEGGY ( angry  --  on the defensive ) I 'd rather work for a Madame than for a pimp . I 'm not turning my money over to no damn man . You bet not . I 'd rather get out and rustle than work for a pimp. ( pause  --  then  --  ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says they 're nice fellows , Wilma  --  nothing nasty  --  they 're from out of town  --  they just want a little whirl . p. 11 WILMA What kind of a whirl ? PEGGY With girls of course . Listen , Wilma - they 'll take us out and feed us swell . They just want some one to steer em  --  show em the spots and  --  WILMA I ca n't steer em  --  I do n't know one place from another . PEGGY Leave that to me . I know my way around  --  I 'll take us to a swell place . WILMA And what do I do ? PEGGY You just smile  --  and let the guy think you like him . WILMA And if I do n't ? PEGGY You can smile  --  ca n't you ? WILMA And then ? PEGGY Then we 'll go with ' em some place  --  some good hotel or  --  WILMA No ! PEGGY ( impatient ) You can beat it if you want to . I 'll take ' em both on if necessary . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 'll look lovely . What do you say ? WILMA You know what I say . How many times do I have to say it ? You asked me this before and got your answer  --  why do you ask me now ? p. 12 PEGGY Answers ai n't always the same . I thought  --  with Garry out of a job  --  you 'd be getting fed up . WILMA No . Not yet . Not ever . PEGGY ( getting up ) Well  --  you dug your own grave  --  now lie in it . ( looks around disdainfully ) You better get you a television anyway if you 're going to spend the rest of your life sittin ' home waitin for Garry . I got me one  --  for business . I thought it would entertain the suckers - take the burden off me . I thought every guy liked to look at fights and baseball  --  but they do n't waste no time on it . ( starts to go - stops - turns back ) Wilma ! Did n't you ever go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way you mean - not any way - hardly . PEGGY I suspected something like that !  --  God I was well along when I was fourteen . WILMA How could you help it  --  it was all around you ! PEGGY It 's all around me yet  --  and how ! WILMA ( thoughtfully ) It was all around Garry too  --  but he kept clear of it - ( sudden intensity ) And that 's why I love him - if you want to know  --  p. 13 PEGGY What do you mean ? WILMA What I told you ! - His goodness ! His decency ! PEGGY ( laughs ) WILMA I know ! Laugh at him ! Jeer at him ! - Look down on him ! Well - you 'd look up to him - if you knew ! PEGGY ( impatient ) Knew what ? WILMA I 'm not going to tell you ! PEGGY You said that before - what you so cagey about ? Go on - tell me - ( jeers ) if it will make me look up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pause ) What would you say if I tell you that this boy you say is so bad - is so good ! - so good ! he 's never asked anything of me - nothing !  --  not once since we 've been married  --  PEGGY You mean you do n't live together ? WILMA Live together ? Of course we live together ! ( makes a wide gesture to take in the room ) But not the way you mean  --  ( pause ) You do n't believe that - do you ? PEGGY No I don't. p. 14 WILMA Well - it 's true . PEGGY It just do n't make sense . WILMA Not to you - naturally - but to me - it 's goodness - plain goodness . PEGGY Well to me - it 's craziness - plain craziness ! ( pause ) I ca n't get it ! ( thoughtfully - lighting a cigarette ) He never liked girls  --  that 's sure . But never liked men - either . Never liked nobody ! Always by himself . Like he was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid pardner  --  to play being bad man with . Well  --  just a cold potato I guess  --  like ma  --  got it from her I guess - while I take after my dad . Ma was a cold potato - but dad was hot stuff . I used to hear ' em in bed at night . " Jesus " he 'd say you 're like a cold potato " and then he 'd get up and put his pants on and go out and raise hell - not come home for days . Finally he did n't show up at all - we never did know what became of him  --  If you think telling me this makes me like him any better - you 're all wrong ! It makes me dislike him more ! GARRY comes on at hall door . He is a handsome boy , well built and graceful , with lithe restless movements . This restlessness is brought to rest at times by sudden moods of dreaminess - when he is lost in fantasy  --  as a child . p. 15 GARRY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GARRY Well Wilma do n't want to see you  --  neither do I  --  get going . PEGGY I 'll get going when I please . GARRY Want me to throw you out ? WILMA Do n't fight  --  please Garry  --  why do both of you always fight ? GARRY ( turning away - sort of obediently ) Because we hate each other 's guts ! WILMA Why ? Why do you ? GARRY She 's no good ! PEGGY I 'm as good as you are , angel !  --  better . GARRY You 're a bum ! PEGGY I ai n't either a bum . I earn my living  --  that 's more'n you do . GARRY Pickin ' up men on the streets . PEGGY Not any more . I 've graduated . GARRY Graduated ? You never got through grammar school  --  too busy lookin ' for a fast buck  --  even then . PEGGY To give to my mother ! p. 16 GARRY Cripes  --  that 's what they all say . PEGGY You never did anything for her . She killed herself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's dirt ! GARRY Because she liked it ! PEGGY What do you mean ? GARRY She liked to clean people 's garbage pails and their toilets  --  PEGGY What are you talkin ' about ? GARRY I heard her say it ! PEGGY Say what ? GARRY That she liked to clean up dirt  --  that it gave her a satisfaction . That 's all I ever heard as a kid  --  dirt ! Dirty ! that 's dirty  --  you 're dirty  --  she was always hollerin ' it at me . PEGGY She cleaned up dirt to get the money to feed you ! GARRY To get the money to get drunk with ! PEGGY What if she did drink a little  --  she did it to get a little rest ! GARRY Rest ! PEGGY Yes ! In her mind ! Every person has to have a little rest in their mind now and then  --  or they 'd go crazy . p. 17 GARRY You 're crazy . PEGGY If she did drink a little  --  she drank decent ! ( as he laughs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women - or alone ! She never drank with no men ! GARRY Not like you . PEGGY Well I ai n't never been in jail ! GARRY Now you start throwing that up at me ! PEGGY Well ai n't you always been in trouble ? Since you was  --  ( suddenly ) What 's that on your cuff ? GARRY What ? PEGGY That ! Blood - ai n't it ? GARRY Blood nothin PEGGY What is it then ? GARRY Wine I guess . PEGGY Wine  --  my eye  --  GARRY How do you know it ai n't ? PEGGY Wine 's purple . That 's red . Blood red . What you been doing now ? Killin ' somebody ? GARRY What you talkin about ? PEGGY You been in a fight ? p. 18 GARRY It 's wine  --  I tell yuh ! PEGGY You been in a fight  --  maybe killing somebody ! GARRY Shut up  --  damn you . WILMA Garry ! Do n't ! PEGGY Cursing me  --  do n't you want to hit me ? GARRY ( quiet again ) Not if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  I would n't talk to you - you ai n't fit to talk to . WILMA Peggy  --  leave him alone  --  do n't nag him  --  just go  --  please go . PEGGY I 'm going all right . You bet I 'm going . I do n't want to be mixed up in no killing . ( in the doorway ) You 'll end up in the hot seat  --  someday  --  Garry  --  You 'll pay  --  mark my words  --  you 'll pay . ( She goes ) GARRY I 'll pay ! For What ! For livin ? I did n't want to be born , did I ? Why have I got to pay ? WILMA ( soothing ) For nothing . You 've never done anything wrong , really . GARRY She said this was blood ! p. 19 WILMA Do n't pay any attention to her . GARRY Said I 'd die in the hot seat . WILMA She did n't mean it . GARRY Yes she did ! She used to always say it  --  her and ma . WILMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not any of it  --  GARRY Do n't let her come here any more . I do n't want to see her ! She repels me . Just to look at her repels me  --  Just the way she lives ! All that dirty business ! It repels me ! WILMA Oh Garry ! You 're so good and decent ! When I think she tries to tell me you 're not ! GARRY I do n't want her hanging around here  --  turning you against me . WILMA Nothing can turn me against you Garry . GARRY Oh Wilma  --  you love me , do n't you ? WILMA Yes . GARRY Say it . WILMA I love you . GARRY ( desperately ) Hold me , Wilma  --  Hold me . WILMA ( taking him in her arms ) There-dear-there. p. 20 GARRY ( frightened ) Never let me down  --  will yuh , Wilma ? WILMA No . GARRY Stick by me through thick and thin ? WILMA Yes . GARRY Always ? WILMA Always . GARRY ( gets up restlessly ) WILMA What is it , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some music  --  and then you hold me some more . ( goes to radio - finds music - comes back to her ) WILMA ( puts her arms around him ) GARRY When you hold me like this - I feel good - and safe - like a little kid with it 's mother . WILMA Oh Garry - do n't say that ! GARRY Why not ? WILMA Makes me feel so old ! There 's only a little difference between us . GARRY I do n't mean my real mother  --  not her  --  you bet not !  --  one I dreamed up . p. 21 WILMA Is n't it funny how we both disliked our mothers . GARRY Did you dream up a good one , too ? WILMA No . I just made up my mind I would n't be like her in anything  --  ever . GARRY ( dreaming ) I dreamed up a good one . When ma would nag and holler I used to go down to the river and sit on that old guard rail there and think about a dream mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you was a kid  --  dream up people ? WILMA ( nods ) All lonely children do . How was she Garry  --  the dream one ? GARRY Oh I do n't just remember now  --  only she was sweet . Her voice was sweet . And she smelled sweet  --  like ice cream  --  you know the funny notions kids have . You 're lots like her . When I first saw you - it struck me - everything about you  --  I guess that 's why I wanted to marry you . WILMA And you 're like my father to me . GARRY The real one ? WILMA Yes . It 's like I want to make up to him  --  through you  --  for all the meanness my mother did to him ! ( voice rising ) Kicking him when he was down  --  not pity  --  no help  --  no love  --  nothing ! Sat in a courtroom - and told on him  --  p. 22 GARRY Do n't get excited about it , kid . It 's over . WILMA It 'll never be over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't make it over . I can hear her now  --  telling on him - sending him to jail ! GARRY You 'd never do that to me - would you ? WILMA Never . ( quieter ) GARRY You 're a swell girl , will  --  best I ever knew . I never knew there was a girl like you  --  never believed it . WILMA I just love you , Garry. ( pause - then ) Let 's go to bed now - dear - Shall we ? It 's awfully late . GARRY O.K. ( gets up - starts to take off his shirt - sees the stained cuff ) Better wash this first - I guess . It 's my best one . WILMA I 'll do it for you , dear . You 've got to put salt on wine to get it out . GARRY ( staring at the cuff ) It ai n't  --  wine . WILMA Garry ! What is it ? ( as he makes no answer ) Is it  --  blood ? p. 23 GARRY ( slowly  --  still dreamily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? GARRY Fight . WILMA Who with ? GARRY With a louse ! WILMA What do you mean ? GARRY A louse  --  one of those  --  a fairy ( as she looks bewildered ) You know what a fairy is , do n't you ? a  --  WILMA What were you fighting with him for ? GARRY Because he wanted me  --  WILMA Wanted you ? GARRY ( excitedly ) Yeah ! And I did n't want him ! No ! I 'm not one of those  --  You bet not ! I never have been and I never will be . Not me ! You can say anything else you want about me  --  but not that ! That 's my pride ! WILMA How did you know he  --  wanted you ? Did he say it ? GARRY Say it ? He damn near raped me . WILMA Do n't talk like this , Garry ! What 's wrong with you tonight ? GARRY Well - he did ! p. 24 WILMA It just turns my stomach inside  --  all this kind of talk ! it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this were ' til I came here  --  I  --  still ca n't believe it  --  I  --  GARRY Well I 've known it ever since I could crawl ! Men have always been after me  --  when I was just a little kid they started pesterin ' me  --  I was always fightin ' em off . WILMA Where were you when you fought tonight ? On the Street ? GARRY No  --  in his room . WILMA Where ? GARRY Hotel  --  a suite  --  a rich guy I 'm tellin you . WILMA How did you get there ? GARRY He asked me . WILMA What did you go for ? GARRY He said we was going to talk over a job for me . WILMA Oh how mean to fool you like that . GARRY A louse I 'm telling you . WILMA How did you come to know him . GARRY In a bar . WILMA Garry  --  I thought you 'd gone out to see a man about a job . p. 25 GARRY Yeah . That 's what I was there for . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could maybe put me on to something good . WILMA A bartender ? GARRY Bartender 's know more influential people than anybody . WILMA Did he introduce you to this man there ? GARRY No . WILMA Well how did you come to talk to him . GARRY He come to talk to me. ( impatiently ) He was sittin at the end of the bar drinkin by himself  --  after while he got up - come over to me . Began talkin - bought me a drink . Said he 'd just come in town on business and was fillin in time til next day . WILMA What business ? GARRY Retail business I think he said . Asked me what I did  --  I said I was lookin for a job . He said he thought he could get me something  --  asked me what I wanted and all that . WILMA What did you say ? GARRY I told him anything that paid good money - and he said he know something . WILMA He was a louse , Garry ! p. 26 GARRY ( encouraged ) Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I did n't want to come along . When we got on the street he said we probably could n't get in a good one and he could n't bear to sit through a bum one  --  said he knew I was the same ( dreamily ) Boy  --  that 's a good one ! I used to sit in movies all day sometimes  --  all day and all night  --  just sittin there  --  lettin em go by . ( pause - dreams ) WILMA What then , Garry ? GARRY Oh - asked me if I did n't want t come up to his room for another drink  --  night cap he called it  --  said he wanted to learn more about me  --  about the job  --  the dirty  --  WILMA And then what ? GARRY I told you ! Jesus that he 'd think I was a punk ! No ! Never ! Not me ! Why when I was in the reformatory there was three little nigger fairies in there  --  and all the guys was sneaking in  --  sleepin with em  --  every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too proud .

WILMA All this talk about these kind of men and GARRY I know . That lousy joker  --  he just muddied me all up . God I 'd like to kill those crumbs . WILMA How much did you hurt him , Garry ? GARRY Not much  --  I just  --  pushed him away . WILMA But the blood ! GARRY Oh he tripped  --  and knocked his head on the corner of one of them low flat tables swells put in front of a chesterfield-you know to put your cigarette on  --  and your drink  --  it was just a scratch . WILMA Are you sure ? GARRY Sure I 'm sure . I listened to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him none  --  he hurt himself . WILMA I know , dear - but if the probation people learn you were in a fight - Oh Garry  --  what awfully bad luck that just now - when you 're doing so well  --  you have to get mixed up in a frightful thing like this . GARRY They wo n't find out . WILMA How do you know ? p. 28 GARRY Because the guy wo n't tell . He wo n't want anyone to know stuff like this  --  you bet he wo n't . WILMA Yes  --  I guess that 's true . ( pause - then ) Well  --  you better try to get some sleep now  --  ( takes the cover off the couch  --  sees the shirt ) ( Picks it up  --  starts into inner room ) GARRY ( suddenly ) Will  --  let 's get out a here ? Shall we ? WILMA ( turning ) Get out ? GARRY Yeah  --  beat it . WILMA What for ? - if  --  GARRY For nothing ! I just want to beat it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean , Garry ? Sick of me ?

GARRY ( taking out the money - counting it ) Off him  --  that 's how I got the blood on me - turning him over . You 'd think a swell like that would carry his poke in his inside breast pocket would n't yuh ? But no  --  he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you should n't have taken anything from him . GARRY Why not ? WILMA It 'll make everything worse for you . Now he can go to the police and report a robbery  --  not say anything about the other . GARRY I had a right to take it  --  why should a louse like that - have all this  --  and me  --  nothin ! WILMA Does any one know you were with him ? Any one see you ? GARRY Just the elevator boy  --  but he did n't pay no mind . p. 30 WILMA Did n't any one see you going out of the bar with him ? GARRY No . WILMA The bartender must have  --  and he knows you ! GARRY He wo n't talk . WILMA They 're always talking . GARRY About nothin ' . When it 's somethin ' important they 're clams . WILMA Did he know the man ? GARRY How do I know ? WILMA When he was pourin ' him a drink you could tell  --  did he know him , Garry ? GARRY Do n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother  --  my real one . WILMA Garry do n't ! I just want to know !

GARRY What you going to do with it ? WILMA I 'm going to burn it . GARRY No ! This is a big score , Will ! We can use it ! p. 31 WILMA We ca n't use money like this , Garry ! GARRY Why not ? WILMA It 's dirty ! GARRY You sound like my mother ! WILMA We ca n't touch a dime of it . Give it to me ( as he hesitates ) You must n't have it on you , Garry , if they  --  GARRY They ca n't trace money ! WILMA But we never could account for all that ! Give it to me . GARRY No ! How are we going to get out ? WILMA We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he could report a robbery . WILMA If he does - we 're better off here . We got a roof over our heads anyway .

WILMA Afterwards I got a kind of faith  --  that if you did right  --  God would look out for you and nothing would harm you . Then this thing happened to Garry and me  --  when we was doing so good ! So I lost all that  --  and was  --  afraid again . p. 66 DAVE You showed wonderful courage that day . WILMA That was for Garry . And because you were there . DAVE Me ? WILMA ( nods ) Why did you go away ? DAVE I had to  --  My mother was sick . WILMA Oh . Is she all right now ? DAVE ( shakes his head ) She 's  --  gone . ( turns away to hide his emotion - picks up Wilma 's glass ) Had n't you better drink this now ? You have n't touched it . WILMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough when your mother goes . I know . Even my mother . I did n't like her , but when  --  DAVE You did n't like her ? WILMA No.  --  No I did n't  --  But when she went  --  I felt  --  awful . She just was n't there any more . I was all alone . DAVE ( nods ) I know - WILMA It 's as though they stand between you and  --  the dark  --  somehow . ( drinks ) ( pause - then ) Did she just now  --  go ? p. 67 DAVE No . Right after I got home . WILMA Why did n't you come back then ? DAVE Oh my father wanted me to stay with him . He was pretty hard hit  --  wanted me to help him run the ranch and batch  --  ( smiles ) cook for him he meant by that . WILMA Can you cook ? DAVE Sure I can cook . WILMA What can you make ? DAVE Biscuits  --  pancakes  --  chocolate cake  --  frijoles  --  chili con carne . We have good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILMA He must have hated to see you go . DAVE He did . WILMA Why did you ? DAVE Oh I do n't know  --  restless I guess . WILMA He 'll marry again  --  if he 's all alone . DAVE I do n't think so  --  not very soon anyway  --  he and my mother were too close  --  like one person  --  WILMA I know . But being alone is terrible . DAVE I know . p. 68 WILMA ( gets up - restless again ) DAVE What is it - Wilma ? What 's wrong ? WILMA I do n't know . Just something in the air . ( crosses to window - looks out ) DAVE You 're all shot to pieces ! What you been doing to yourself . WILMA ( staring out ) Nothing ! Just working . DAVE Same job ? WILMA No  --  I quit that . DAVE Why ? WILMA ( turns to him ) Oh  --  everybody knew about Garry and everything .  --  He 'd worked there , too , you know . I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't give you no mind . I 'm in Nacy 's now . DAVE Like it ? WILMA ( nods ) It 's a step up . ( pause - comes down to table ) Are you still on the paper ? DAVE Yep - Got my old job back . WILMA You must be good . DAVE ( laughs ) I 'm learning . p. 69 WILMA ( picks up a cigarette ) I guess you went to school a lot , did n't you ? DAVE ( lighting her cigarette for her ) No . I did n't quite finish college . WILMA Why not . DAVE War took me . WILMA I hardly started high . DAVE What took you ? WILMA The five and ten . DAVE That must have been kind a touch for a kid  --  was n't it ? WILMA My mother said I had to get out and earn my keep  --  and I was n't trained for anything yet . But I kept on going to night school  --  DAVE Did n't leave you much time for fun did it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( moves away from him - back to window ) DAVE Why did you have to get out and work  --  did your father die ? WILMA No . He went to prison . DAVE ( surprised ) Your father was in prison , too ? p. 70 WILMA Yes . It was just one mistake . DAVE That 's all it takes . WILMA He was in love with a girl  --  and wanted to go away with her . My mother was n't very loving . DAVE And he wanted love - huh ? WILMA Do n't everybody ? He took some money from the place he worked - and they put him in jail ! ( crying out ) That 's why I came cast here  --  to get away from all that jail business  --  prisons and  --  it was always hanging over me . Even my mother kept throwing it up to me all the time  --  that I was my father 's child  --  and he was no good . It was n't true that he was no good . He was just  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause - then ) Why do you let your life keep repeating itself like this ? WILMA Repeating ? What do you mean ? DAVE All this prison stuff . Your father and then Garry - WILMA ( quickly ) Garry was never in prison . DAVE Reform school then ! Why do you do it over ? WILMA I do n't do it  --  It does itself . p. 71 DAVE You let it  --  you make it . WILMA How ? DAVE You married Garry because of your father  --  did n't you ? WILMA I suppose that was some of it  --  in a way . DAVE Running right back to what you were running away from . Why ? WILMA I do n't know ! I guess I wanted to help him - save him  --  DAVE That 's a tough assignment you gave yourself . WILMA What do you mean ? DAVE Making yourself responsible for some one who 's irresponsible  --  WILMA That 's all he is  --  just irresponsible . DAVE Is n't that enough ? ( gets up ) Let 's have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to this stuff ' til now . DAVE Now you 're not  --  huh ? WILMA Not just this minute . But before I was . DAVE ( pouring ) I thought you started drinking at ll in the morning . p. 72 WILMA Why ? Oh  --  that was just then  --  to keep you here  --  so Garry could get away  --  DAVE Oh  --  ( hands her glass ) WILMA ( takes it - looks at it ) They say there 's a lot of forgetfulness in this stuff . DAVE For a while  --  WILMA I 've spilled a lot of things to you tonight  --  I never said to nobody before . DAVE Sorry ? WILMA No . Glad . It 's made me feel better  --  free of it  --  light and free . DAVE It 's helpful stuff at times . WILMA I know but  --  oh  --  when my father got all mixed up  --  he started drinkin '  --  that 's why he got into trouble  --  and Garry  --  if Garry had n't had all those drinks that night  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovers ) ' Til now I saw only the bad side of drinking . Now I begin to see the good . I 'm not blue any more now - not so blue and anxious ! - Maybe it 's this - and maybe it 's you ! It 's like something comes from you  --  to me . Like a strength - a power ! ( cries out ) When you 're near  --  I feel safe . ( pause - then ) You 're going to be around now  --  are n't you ? p. 73 DAVE That depends - WILMA On what ? DAVE On you  --  ( pause - then ) I want you to be my girl  --  will yuh ? WILMA Your girl ? DAVE Yes . WILMA You mean  --  DAVE Yes ! WILMA ( angry ) So that 's what you came for ! To see the hard - drinking low down Oakie girl  --  that you could have a lot of fun with ! ( as he makes no answer ) Yes ! That 's what you 're after ! Well let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down on so  --  he did n't even proposition me like you 're doing !  --  and all the rest of ' em - He just used to stand around and look at me  --  I could n't understand it  --  DAVE I can  --  WILMA No . I 'm not pretty  --  not enough to stand around and stare at  --  Afterwards I understood it  --  He told me  --  DAVE What ? WILMA I reminded him of someone  --  Someone he 'd dreamed about ever since he was a kid  --  I reminded him of her  --  seemed like I was her . p. 74 DAVE Who was she ? WILMA I 'm not going to tell you  --  because you 'd laugh . DAVE No . WILMA Yes ! At him and at me ! But that 's why he loved me - And I loved him - not because of my father - and all that kind of stuff - you put it on - No !  --  it 's a lot simpler than that  --  Because he 's so decent ! Good ! I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and those that did made me sick  --  I never went out with one in my life that did n't begin to paw me  --  and want to get into bed with me  --  right away  --  that 's all follows think about now-a-days - even you . I thought you were such a wonderful boy that day  --  I thought about you a lot  --  and I wanted you to come back  --  well - here you show up with a flask of whiskey in your back pocket  --  and the same old rottenness in your mind . Now you can just get out . DAVE Take it easy , kid . Let me explain . WILMA There is n't anything to explain . DAVE You been on my mind - ever since I saw you that day  --  Love at first sight - I guess you 'd call it . WILMA ( jeering ) Love ? DAVE Yes . p. 75 WILMA You love me ? DAVE I asked you to be my girl - did n't I ? WILMA That does n't mean anything - a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't give a damn about you . DAVE I guess I did get you wrong that day  --  but now I 'm going to tell you something  --  something I never thought I 'd tell anybody . WILMA What ? DAVE ( uncertainly ) Well - the day before my mother died - I was sitting there by her - she was looking at me a long time - just looking - then she reached ouher hand to me  --  and said  --  ( he stops - then goes on ) We had n't been talking about anything like this  --  but she said  --  ( stops ) WILMA What ? I 'll understand . DAVE She said " Have girls , Dave  --  if you want them . But do n't ever think that 's all there is . Do n't give too much of yourself to them . Because one day there 'll be one girl . And all you have  --  and all you are  --  wo n't seem to you enough to give to her " . ( pause - then ) Well - you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think that when you came here . p. 76 DAVE No  --  I did n't . WILMA What changed you ? DAVE You . WILMA I 'm sorry I was so stinkin ' mean  --  ( suddenly ) I 'd love to be your girl Dave  --  Yes I would !  --  But I ca n't . DAVE Why not ? WILMA Garry . I ca n't run out on him like this  --  I 'm all he has ! DAVE What good are you to him now ? WILMA He knows I 'm here  --  I ca n't leave him in the lurch  --  not now ! No ! That 's what my mother did ! Left my father in the lurch  --  DAVE That 's all over . It has nothing to do with you  --  now ! WILMA No  --  it 's still in me. ( as he makes an impatient gesture ) I ca n't kick him off now when he 's down  --  What would it do to him ? Just kill the last bit of faith he has . That 's what my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another man  --  just to show the world she  --  DAVE There 's no world in this . Just you and me . WILMA And him . p. 77 DAVE And your father and your mother and your father 's girl and  --  Why do you bring all your childhood into this ? Did n't it hurt you enough then ? WILMA It 's because it hurt me so then  --  that I try not to do the same things now . DAVE Making every decision because of something somebody else did ! In the Past ! Not facing up to anything as it is now ! To reality ! To  --  WILMA It 's reality that I 'm married , is n't it ? DAVE Yes ! To a no-good kid that  --  WILMA Do n't . DAVE I 'm sorry  --  I did n't want to say that ! I just wanted to say that he 's gone - and you and I are here - listen - let 's try it together  --  shall we ? And if it goes as good as I think it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVE But would n't it do good - for us - ( laughs a little ) " Whatever I do bad  --  is good " . Who said that ? Thoreau was n't it ? WILMA I do n't know  --  I do n't know anything  --  except that I 've got to stay by him  --  Wait til he shows up . DAVE He may never show up . p. 78 WILMA Yes  --  as soon as he thinks its safe  --  I 'll get word - or something . DAVE It 's past the time now . They either show pretty quick - as soon as they can make it  --  or they find a new life while they 're waiting  --  and just never come back  --  WILMA Well - I just have to wait  --  that 's all  --  DAVE That 's a long sentence you 're giving yourself . WILMA I know it ! But  --  it 's like you said about your father and mother  --  We 're one person . Garry and me  --  One person ! DAVE Well  --  that 's that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying out ) Do n't go ! DAVE Yes  --  I 've got to now . WILMA ( overwhelmed  --  speaks half to herself ) Just a dream  --  come and gone . Everything in my life has been like that  --  and everybody  --  come and gone  --  my father  --  Garry  --  now you  --  come and gone  --  just dreams . DAVE Your love for Garry is real enough  --  all right . WILMA Not enough  --  Not enough to save him  --  Nothing real . p. 79 DAVE You could have made  --  ours real . WILMA No  --  Not real  --  Or you could n't leave me now . Just a dream .  --  Now the nightmare comes again . DAVE You 'll be all right . WILMA I 'll be alone . ( crying out ) I 'm afraid . DAVE Nothing 's going to harm you . You 'll go on just the same . WILMA Everything will come in on me now ! DAVE What ? WILMA Everything ! Everything ! It will all come at me again ! Bell rings at outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DAVE Yes . WILMA So late  --  no one ever comes  --  ( crying out ) Maybe it 's Garry ! DAVE ( at the window ) It 's a woman  --  ( turns away ) WILMA ( goes to window ) It 's Garry 's sister  --  she never comes any more  --  I wonder what she wants  --  maybe it 's something about Garry. p. 80 DAVE Well  --  lot her in . WILMA ( starts to hall door - turns ) I do n't want her to see you here ! DAVE Why not ? WILMA She 'll misconstrue  --  she misconstrues everything . DAVE ( moves to door , too ) I was going anyway . WILMA Go out up the back stairs ! DAVE ( not liking it ) All right  --  WILMA And come back ! DAVE No ! WILMA ( crying out ) Yes !  --  Do n't leave me like this  --  I 'm afraid ! DAVE Why ? WILMA There 's something awful in the air ! I feel it !  --  Come back  --  as soon as she 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILMA I 'll put the radio on so you 'll know  --  If the radio 's on  --  she 's gone  --  Come back ! Promise me ! Come back ! Bell rings DAVE ( soothing ) All right  --  I 'll come back  --  HE goes Wilma at door - watches him go up back stairs then goes out to outer door - re-enters with PEGGY . Peggy is now a blonde - with a newly acquired elegance in all way  --  p. 81 PEGGY I thought I heard voices . WILMA Radio - I guess . ( staring at Peggy ) Peggy - I 'd hardly know you ! PEGGY Changed my make-up  --  like it ? WILMA It 's spectacular ! PEGGY That 's the idea - you look all upset ! WILMA I always get upset if someone comes to the door at night . PEGGY Why ? WILMA I think it might be Garry . PEGGY Any news ? WILMA No . You ? PEGGY No  --  and I hope I never do . I add it to my prayers every night - that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard  --  so cruel ! PEGGY Just because I 'm not a sap  --  like you . Garry 's dangerous  --  do n't you know that Wilma WILMA No ! PEGGY Well - he is . He should n't be on the loose . He has n't any sense  --  he 's like a child  --  a wild child  --  WILMA I know that . p. 82 PEGGY He blows his trap too damned easy . He can be as cold as ice and then  --  hot as hell . I know . I 'm the same . In another way . That 's why I 'm such a success . WILMA I wish you had n't come  --  PEGGY Do n't be rude , Wilma . It 's so common . WILMA What did you come for any way ? PEGGY Just to see you  --  pass the time . WILMA It 's pretty late for a call . PEGGY Late ? I 'm way early for my date . That 's why I stopped off . Anything I hate is to wait for a guy in a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ) Well how is everything ? WILMA The same . PEGGY You still in the same racket ? WILMA What racket ? PEGGY That package wrapping stuff . WILMA Yes . PEGGY God ! ( pause - then ) Have you had your dinner ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY What ? p. 83 WILMA I had a hot dog  --  and a coke . PEGGY Ugh ! ( nods to flask ) You seem to have something else . WILMA You want a drink ? PEGGY No . WILMA ( surprised ) You do n't ? PEGGY I 've quit  --  off the stuff for good  --  WILMA You look lots better , Peggy . PEGGY I ought to  --  costs enough  --  ( looking around ) Boy this is a lousy dump  --  how can you stay here ? WILMA It 's my home  --  is n't it ? PEGGY Home ! I 'm going to get you out a here ! WILMA Do n't begin on that , Peg . I know that 's what you came for  --  we 've been ever all that  --  PEGGY The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , Wilma I can offer you something really good now . WILMA What ? PEGGY I 've got a friend now . WILMA You mean you just have one man ? p. 84 PEGGY Oh no  --  I 'm still working  --  harder than ever . But I 've a friend who looks out for me  --  everything  --  gets me the business  --  wonderful business ! You know who it is  --  Worthington Platt , the 3rd ! WILMA Who 's he ? PEGGY He 's well known ! Everybody in society knows that name ! He takes everything off my hands  --  collects and  --  WILMA What ever his name is he 's a  --  ( stops ) I thought you said you 'd never have one of those ! PEGGY This is different . ( seriously ) He loves me , Will ! And I do him . When we 're together it 's not just the same old business ! It 's something else . He looks out for me  --  personally  --  keeps me happy . That 's why I do n't drink any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business reasons  --  When I 'm working . He thinks it 's bad for my health ! I 'm awfully happy now . I do n't get depressed like I used to sometimes . A girl 's got to have someone who cares about her  --  you just ca n't go on without it . WILMA I know . PEGGY He 's way above me socially - of course  --  and in brains ,  --  He was in all the best schools - for a while and he worked in an advertising firm - for a while  --  that 's how he 's made me ! p. 85 WILMA That was n't too hard was it ? PEGGY Do n't get nasty , Wilma . I hate nastiness . WILMA Well - what do you mean  --  made you ? PEGGY Advertising ! He made up a slogan for me  --  Got me to dye my hair  --  and made up a slogan " The Golden Vice Girl " . Can you visualize that , Wilma ? Think of those three words ! Just . separate ! Just one of em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together ! And it 's me ! Boy the guys just stand in line . I got so many customers I ca n't handle the business alone . It wo n't last forever I know . That 's why Worthy thinks I ought to get another girl in with me  --  while it 's hot . I 'd like to keep it in the family so I thought of you first  --  what do you say ? WILMA You know what I say . PEGGY Do n't say it yet . Get the whole picture . Let me finish . Listen Wilma  --  you stand up all day and wrap packages  --  for thirty dollars a week . I make thirty dollars a throw now  --  sometimes fifty . A night up to five hundred ! WILMA Five hundred dollars ! PEGGY Yes . Look at these clothes ! They did n't come out of Gimble 's basement . I got a swell apartment now  --  beautiful . I live just like a society girl . You can move right in  --  share everything . p. 86 WILMA I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here  --  wrappin packages - eatin hamburgers  --  all your life ? Have n't you any ambition ? Do n't you want to get ahead ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY Well how you going to do it . You do n't know anything to get in the money  --  and ca n't do anything  --  except what I 'm telling you . I offer you a lovely home  --  WILMA It 's not a home  --  Peggy  --  it 's a house . PEGGY You afraid some cops will raid us ? You need n't be . I got all the protection in the world now  --  with Worthy . WILMA It 's not that . PEGGY Just be on call then  --  for parties . And go to a good hotel . That 's as safe as the U. S. Treasury . Listen , Wilma , playing it that way you 'll have security as well as economic independence . What more do you want ? It 's what everyone is hollerin ' for  --  what do you say ? WILMA Listen , Peggy  --  I know you mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEGGY Why not ? It goes for me  --  and big ! WILMA Well  --  I 'm different . p. 87 PEGGY You mean a sap ? You ca n't go on livin ' like this  --  do n't you know that ? WILMA Why ca n't I , I make my living . PEGGY I do n't mean that . WILMA What do you mean ? PEGGY I mean like this ! With no man ! You 'll go all queer  --  nutty . You look terrible already ! WILMA I do ? PEGGY Yes  --  terrible  --  all peeked and pinched  --  miserable . WILMA That 's just worry . ( got 's up - looks in mirror ) PEGGY God . I ca n't go without a man two days  --  If I do I get so irritable  --  and kind of itchy all over  --  WILMA People are n't all like that . PEGGY Yes they are . Only you do n't see it  --  unless you 're wise to ' em like me . I 've always known people were no good  --  men especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess that I suddenly woke up that they were all suckers , too . Since then I 've been doing fine  --  just fine . WILMA I do n't believe people are no good ! PEGGY You do n't believe they 're good , do you ? p. 88 WILMA Yes , But different . You 're good in your way , Peggy . I - in mine .  --  We 're just different . PEGGY You 're not different  --  You 're just in a rut ! And I 'm trying to get you out of it ! Once you get rolling  --  ( looks at wrist watch ) Boy  --  I 've got to beat it ! I 'm late , now - but that 's all right . Worthy says to always be a little late  --  just enough to make ' em eager  --  not enough to make ' em sore  --  ( gets up ) Listen kid  --  Get you some nice fellow ! If you do n't want to come in with me- O.K. I see your point of view - and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dreary and  --  ( suddenly ) Is it really true what you told me ? That you 've never really made love with a man in your life ? WILMA ( hesitant ) It was true  --  But it is n't  --  any more . PEGGY You mean you 've got a friend ? WILMA ( hesitant ) No . I mean Garry  --  that last night . PEGGY You made love - that night ? WILMA Yes . PEGGY For the first time ? p. 89 WILMA Yes . PEGGY Oh Wilma ! That 's just terrible ! WILMA Why ? PEGGY He had to kill a man to be able to love you ! Is n't that pretty terrible ? WILMA You always think awful things about everything Peggy ! You  --  PEGGY Well I 've got this right ! And it is awful ! WILMA No ! He was unhappy ! And he needed me ! and  --  PEGGY It 's so awful - it makes me feel sick ! ( her eye falls on whiskey  --  she goes to it ) I think I will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't kick . This call on you was really for business . ( pouring ) You take one , too  --  WILMA ( shakes her head - no ) PEGGY ( lifts glass ) Well  --  here 's love and kisses . ( drinks  --  puts glass down ) I sure needed that drink - I never needed one more  --  Good stuff , too . None of that cat gut I was weaned on  --  mild  --  smooth  --  and potent - like my Worthy  --  ( crosses to hall door ) Well - I 'll be seein ' you.SHE goes . p. 90 WILMA ( stands very still - troubled and thoughtful ) Sound of outer door closing ( she crosses to hall door - closes it after Peggy - comes down to chari by table - then suddenly goes to radio - turns it on ) GARRY on at inner door . He is well dressed in new clothes - and looks very handsome GARRY ( in doorway ) WILMA ( frightened ) Garry ! GARRY Turn it off ! WILMA ( turns radio off quickly - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - you come back ! GARRY Sure I come back . WILMA I knew you would . GARRY Glad ? WILMA Sure I 'm glad . GARRY You do n't act it . You act like you 're scared a me or something . WILMA No ! ( starts to him - stops uneasily ) Let me look at you . You look fine , Garry . GARRY I feel fine  --  WILMA I never saw you look so good ! ( nods to inner door - uneasily ) You been in there  --  long ? p. 91 GARRY ( a little smile on her lips ) Not too long - why ? WILMA Nothing ! I just wondered  --  ( looks at him - he smiles back ) You sure nobody saw you coming in ? GARRY No . Nobody . WILMA Are you sure ? GARRY I came to the window first  --  heard voices  --  so I came in by the stairs . ( smiles ) like I went  --  WILMA Somebody might a recognized you ! ( turns off one light - leaving one on ) GARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have ! ( crosses to window-looks out from behind shade ) GARRY It was cold out there waitin ' . Boy - I ai n't used to this  --  where I come from  --  it 's warm ! Got anything to drink ? WILMA No ! GARRY Yes you have  --  there  --  sittin ' right there . What did you lie to me for ? WILMA Because I do n't want you to start drinkin '  --  not now ! p. 92 GARRY That same old line a yours ! WILMA You got to keep your head , Garry ! GARRY A drink will help me keep my head . ( takes up flask ) You seem to have started on it . WILMA I felt blue . GARRY Yeah ? Who was you drinkin ' with ? WILMA ( confused - uneasy ) With ? GARRY Yeah !  --  two glasses . WILMA Oh . GARRY Who was with yuh ? WILMA Peggy . GARRY Peggy - huh ? WILMA Yes - you heard her voice  --  did n't you ?

WILMA No . GARRY Take one . WILMA I already had one . GARRY You do n't act like it  --  take another . I do n't want to drink alone . WILMA ( takes her drink ) GARRY That 's better - where I come from - a man do n't drink alone - He 's got a companero - a compardro - ( lifts his glass ) Salud ! - You do n't understand that - do you ? WILMA ( shakes her head - no ) GARRY That 's Spanish ! WILMA Where you been - Garry ? GARRY Across the border . WILMA Mexico ?
