After taking more than a month to answer Nehru 's last note on the border dispute , China 's Premier Chou En-lai last week called for a meeting in just eight days because of " our unshirkable responsibility not only to our two peoples , but also to world peace . " <P> Chou 's answer amounts to a total rejection of all of Nehru 's proposals , except the one about not sending out border patrols . Though headlines played up Chou 's willingness to negotiate , the fine print showed that he was in no real bargaining mood . <P> Main points : 1 ) in the East , China will give up its occupation of the Longju outpost , six miles inside the Indian frontier , if India will evacuate ten other passes and strongpoints along the border ; 2 ) in the Western or Kashmir region , China claims to have been in occupation of large areas of Ladakh not for just two years but since 1950 , and with the help of frontier-guard units and " 3,000 civilian builders " to have laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges and building culverts " without India 's knowledge , thus making " absolutely unconvincing " India 's claim to jurisdiction ; 3 ) the strong implication that unless China gets what it wants in Ladakh , the Communists may enlarge their demands in other areas of the 2,500-mile border where China has " not up to now made any demand " ; and 4 ) border peace and mutual confidence " are unattainable by other provisional measures . " After asserting these squatter rights , Chou blandly declared that China is so big a country , and so sparsely settled in half of its area , that it would be " extremely ludicrous " to suspect that Peking would " encroach one inch upon foreign territory .
