Reported TIME White House Correspondent John L. Steele this week : <P> <P> Aides and close friends have sensed a profound change-or perhaps a crystallization of previous changes-in President Eisenhower since the campaign began . Said one of them last week : " The President seems to have reached a new plane of serenity , almost of self-detachment . " Four years in the White House have sharpened his political ear , toughened his belief in himself as a political strategist . But along with this has come a new warmth and understanding . Gone are the occasional flashes of temper that were once the terror of his staff-and of his opponents . They have been replaced by an equanimity and inner ease that is reflected in his desire to campaign chiefly on the record of his administration-and to respond to Democratic attacks only when they impugn or falsify that record . <P> Evidence of this serenity-and of the way it has affected his thinking about his campaign-was written large over the President 's activities last week . His Peoria speech struck hard at Adlai Stevenson for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he regarded as most important was his explanation of the Administration 's own farm record . Similarly , to the surprise of correspondents and staff alike , he showed no anger at his press conference when asked to comment on Stevenson 's attack on his brother Milton Eisen hower . His color rose only once-when he detached himself from implied Republican campaign charges that the Democrats are a " war party . " Said he : " They may be thinking of something that I do n't know anything about , but I do n't believe that when America gets into war we can afford to call it anything but our war . " <P> This serene state of mind has been reflected in another policy decision-the physical schedule of his campaign . He agreed last week to extend his personal barnstorming to Pittsburgh-because pockets of unemployment in Western Pennsylvania represent a danger to Republican candidates , particularly Senator James H. Duff . His newly announced campaign trip to the Midwest and Northwest in mid-October-with speeches planned in Minneapolis , Seattle , Tacoma and Portland-has a similar purpose . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington and Oregon he has given Arthur Langlie and Douglas McKay his backing for the Senate , and he feels honor bound to support them in their uphill races . But the President has shown little concern for candidates in trouble because of local party apathy or faulty leadership . Told of two such spots in Ohio last week , he answered : " Well , why do n't they do something about it instead of calling on me ? " <P> For Ike 's aides his equanimity has certain disadvantages . All last week , as worrisome field reports came in about more trouble spots across the country , they were under increasing pressure to step up the President 's campaigning . But if Ike 's top people were jittery , Ike was not . Late one afternoon , returning to his office after a session with his golf clubs on the White House lawn , he found half a dozen of them talking nervously just outside the door . Said the President mildly : " Why do n't you go home ? " The remark , half rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew : Ike 's confidence is intact .
