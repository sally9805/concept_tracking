The Air Logistics of a Presidential Tour <P> FOR the 36 hr. and 20 min. that the President of the U.S. is airborne on his 19-day , 22,370-mile trip , he will be outranked by his Air Force aide and aircraft commander , Colonel William Draper . And every one of those hours will symbolize days of work by Pilot Bill Draper , 39 , and his crew in coping with the logistics involved in taking the President to the far side of the world and back . <P> For the sake of safety and schedule , the full presidential fleet that takes off this week will be made up of four aircraft ( plus a chartered Pan American 707 jet for the press ) ; two VC-137A plush versions of the Boeing 707 jet-the President 's and an identical spare-and two turboprop MATS Hercules cargo planes carrying six skilled mechanics apiece and a variety of spare parts , including a complete , ready-to-install jet engine . The two cargo planes are assigned a leapfrogging schedule that will keep one of them always one stop ahead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the planes on the ground . To keep watch as Ike flies over the sea is a string of preassigned Navy vessels patrolling the Atlantic at 500-mile intervals . <P> Hi-Fi &; Seat Belts . The President 's flying White House is rigged for the best in comfort and communications . The President himself usually takes off facing forward at a desk in his private compartment ; at his side is an ivory-colored telephone that is hooked into a single-sideband radio , enabling Ike to talk to any spot in the world . For classified conversations , his radio operator uses a radio-teletype which scrambles messages that can only be unscrambled at a single receiving point . Also aboard : reclining chairs , sofa beds , tape player , hifi , two galleys , two astrodomes . <P> Ike 's ten crewmen-eight of whom have flown together for at least six years-rightly feel that their assignments are the best in the Air Force , even if they sometimes have to shell out some of their own money on some presidential trips to cover their meager $12-$18 per diem allowance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a World War II Air Corps transport pilot flying the " fireball run " between Miami and India , personal pilot for President Eisenhower since 1950 , when Ike was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe . Copilot is Iowa-born Lieut . Colonel William Thomas , 39 , veteran of the Hump and Berlin airlift ; navigator is Brooklyn-born Lieut . Colonel Vincent Puglisi , 41 . Filling out the rest of the crew are a third pilot ( who sits in for Draper or Thomas when either leaves his station ) , two flight engineers , a radio operator and three stewards ( who always check with Draper to make sure that the plane is not headed for turbulent weather before they serve the President his meals ) . All carry printed cards listing special emergency procedures , and all frequently ( and unobtrusively ) run through emergency drills . Draper himself makes it a point to review emergency routines with the President , who , like any other plane passenger , fastens his seat belt when the warning goes on .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
