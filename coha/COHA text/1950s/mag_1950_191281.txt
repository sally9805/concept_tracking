Until a couple of months ago , tall , sandy-mustached Willard A. Pleuthner was only a vice president of a big Manhattan advertising agency ( Batten , Barton , Durstine &; Osborn Inc . ) . Last week dazed Adman Pleuthner was trying to adjust himself to the fact that he had suddenly become an important layman-consultant to the country 's Protestant churches . <P> Every day letters stream into his office on Madison Avenue posing all kinds of church problems . In his spare time he is making radio , TV and church appearances to discuss religious affairs . On Sunday of this week , Episcopalian Pleuthner preached a sermon at All Saints ' Episcopal Church in Harrison , N.Y . and a few days later was scheduled to appear on the Tex and Jinx show . Reason for Adman Pleuthner 's new role : his current book , Building Up Your Congregation ( Wilcox &; Follett ; $2.50 ) . <P> Dangerous Dignity . Like many another churchgoing businessman , Bill Pleuthner was surprised by the promotional ignorance of ministers and church boards , whose efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him pitifully unskilled . But instead of just grousing about it and staying away from church , Pleuthner wrote a book . <P> Building Up Your Congregation warns its readers of " the dangerous dignity of church boards . " The board members of churches , he says , " seem to forget that according to the New Testament , thousands of followers were attracted to Christ by what would today be considered undignified miracles-undignified acts of healing . Can you imagine the average church board being asked to approve such miracles as the turning of water into wine , or feeding the multitude on two fishes and five loaves of bread ? " One of the chief weaknesses of church boards , according to Adman Pleuthner , is that they have too many bankers , lawyers , doctors and retired businessmen and too few " sales managers , advertising men , and active business executives on the way up the ladder of success . " What 's wrong with the bankers and lawyers ? They " achieved success by having people come to them for help and not by going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Turning his back on " dangerous dignity , " Pleuthner urges churches to approach the spreading of the Gospel with the same combination of hardheadedness and imagination that B.B.D. &; O. uses to spread the word about Swan Soap and Blackstone Cigars . Goals for regular , continued growth in membership should be set ; the neighborhood should be carefully surveyed by questionnaire and canvasser to determine age and income groups , interests , reasons for coming to church and for staying away . Then ingenuity should be applied to give a fillip to the old , familiar routines . <P> Good Promotion . One of the most practical methods , suggests Pleuthner , is to glamorize the regular Sunday services between the great church festivals of Christmas and Easter by dedicating them to special groups and purposes . Examples : Founders ' Day Sunday ( " Why not honor those families that founded your church ? " ) ; Good Neighbor Sunday ( special letters of invitation from the minister to all members of the neighborhood ) ; Medical Sunday ( " Reserve the front pews for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " when due tribute is paid to God for His gift of flowers to our world " ) .
