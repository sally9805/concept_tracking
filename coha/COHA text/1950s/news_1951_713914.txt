txt WASHINGTON , June 10 ? The inquiry will resume tomorrow with testimony by Lieut . Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer , but the principals in the case have all been heard and the general conclusions here on the controversy seem to be about as follows : Although General of the Army Douglas and the Truman Administration agreed on many things , their differences of judgment over bombing Manchuria and giving Red China an ultimatum , with or without the approval of the United Nations , were fundamental . These differences were not only between General and President Truman and his Cabinet . as General implied , butt also between the general and the 1Joint Chiefs of Staff as well . Impression Rejected The impression created by General 's speech before Congress that the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with his strategy was repudiated by all members of the group . The Joint Chiefs specifically rejected the implication that they had agreed with his policy of bombing Manchuria ( although a careful reading of his testimony shows that he did not say specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various occasions between mid-November and the end of March , 1951 , General took actions in opposition to the spirit of his Government 's policy ? particularly its policy of clearing all foreign policy statements with Washington , and its policy of caution in approaching the Manchurian border with United States troops . The Administration , however , encouraged independent action by the general in the early days of the war , allowed its differences with him to pile up without bringing the issue of civilian control of the military to a satisfactory con // elusion and , in the opinion of most observers here , removed him from his Far Eastern commands with majestic clumsiness . The testimony of the last few weeks , however , did not , and probably could not , clear up the main differences because they were primarily differences of opinion as to how the Soviet Union would react to the bombardment of Manchuria . Nor did this testimony , for all its yardage , straighten out all the differences of fact , for the published record is not complete , and on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases with direct contradictions . The discrepancies in the Administration 's testimony , for example , included the following : 1 . On the day of General 's speech before Congress , the Pentagon issued a statement intended to deal with his implication that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had agreed with his strategy from a military standpoint . Differ on Peace Appeal This statement said that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had " recommended " General 's dismissal . Subsequent testimony by the Joint Chiefs of Staff showed , however , that while they had ap- , proved the dismissal , they had not initiated it and had not ' - 'recommended " it . 2 . The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General of the Army Omar N. Bradley , testified that when General issued his now-famous peace appeal to the Chinese Communists on March 24 , he had seen a different peace appeal that was about to be issued by President Truman with the concurrence of all the nations which had troops fighting in Korea . Subsequent testimony by the Joint Chiefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four days before that such a Presidential proclamation was , planned and knew broadly its intent , he had not , in fact , seen the actual document . 3 . On two points , Secretary of , State Dean Acheson gave an impression of past events that were not quite in keeping with versions given on previous occasions by members of his own department . He said that the Administration had never " considered " recognizing the Chinese Communists or bringing them into the United Nations , in the sense of considering these things favorably , though late in 1949 there was at least some sympathy in the State Department for these acts . Mr. Acheson also indicated that the department had always considered Formosa important to the security of the United States , although in the early winter of 1949 he led the fight against additional aid to save that island from capture by the Communists . 4 . Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall gave the impression that the instructions for his mission to China were written by the State Department , but Secretary Acheson testified that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general 's own aides had actually worked on the final instructions which were approved by General Marshall himself . The discrepancies in General 's own statements during and prior to the inquiry here were even more numerous . For example : 1 . In a message to Arthur Krock , the Washington correspondent of this newspaper , on Nov. 29 , 1950 , General said , " I have received no suggestion from any authoritative source that in the execution of its mission , the command should stop at the Thirty-eighth Parallel , or Pyongyang , or at any other line short of the international boundary . * " " The general thanked Mr. Krock for bringing " anonymous gossip " to this effect to his attention . Six days before this message to Mr. Krock , however , according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , they sent General a message suggesting that , to limit the chances of involvement with the Chinese army , the general might create a neutral zone just short of the Yalu River boundary . Moreover , a cable from General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krock , was introduced into the record by the Joint Chiefs . In this message the Far Eastern Commander rejected the neutral zone idea as " provocative " and said it " would be utterly impossible for the United Nations forces to stop on the commanding terrain south of the Yalu , as suggested . " 2 . Perhaps the decisive issue in the dismissal of General was his March 24 peace appeal to the Chinese Communists . In its issue of April 2 Newsweek magazine published a Story to the effect that prior to issuing his appeal General had been furnished a copy of the President 's proposed peace statement in behalf of United Nations members with troops in Korea . General cabled Newsweek that its report was " entirely without basis in fact . " " I have never seen such a statement , " he stated , " and do not know if it even . exists . Please publish this in the interest of truth . " General Replies on Arming Again in this case , the Joint Chiefs of Staff introduced into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 , four days before the general issued his appeal . It read in part as follows : " State planning Presidential announcement shortly that , with clearing of bulk of South Korea of aggression , United Nations now prepared to discuss conditions of settlement in Korea . Strong United Nations feeling persists that further diplomatic effort toward settlement should be made before any advance with major forces north of Thirty-eighth Parallel . Time will be required to determine diplomatic reactions and permit new negotiations that may develop . * * * " 3 . On March 31 , 1951 , Henry Hazlett of The Freeman Magazine cabled General : " Why do we refuse arms to 400 , - 000 South Korean draftees , as reported in THE NEW YORK TIMES , March 31 , dispatch from Taegu ? " The general replied on April 5 : " I have delayed to reply to your message of the 31st pending receipt here of the referenced NEW YORK TIMES dispatch . There is nothing I can add to the information therein contained . The issue is one determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic political decisions beyond my authority . " The implication of this to observers here was that , unfortunately , this matter was out of General 's hands , but messages between the Joint Chiefs and the Far Eastern commander clearly showed one recommendation from the J. C. S. for arming more South Korean troops and the general 's rejection of the idea at the time on the ground that the arms available could be better used in Japan . Testimony on Strategy 4 . One of the central points of controversy in the whole affair was whether the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved General 's strategy , and here the impression given by the deposed general was different , at least in degree , from the testimony of the others . The impression gained from General 's speech and his subsequent remarks before the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees was that the J.C.S. strategic study of Jan. 12 , 1951 , was a settled statement of their conclusions of what had to be done . The assertion of the Secretary of Defense and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentative " study , dependent upon the development of events in Korea . General discussed it before Congress , however , as a fixed policy of the Joint Chiefs , as the following excnange between him and Senator Richard B. Russell , chairman of the Joint Committee , indicates : CHAIRMAN RUSSELL ? Was there any condition on this order from the Joint Chiefs . General ? GENERAL MACARTHUR ? Was there any what ? CHAIRMAN RUSSELL ? Was there any condition on this order from the Joint Chiefs ? GENERAL MACARTHUR  - -  Any condition ? CHAIRMAN RUSSELL ? Yes , sir , was the blockade not to be enforced unless you evacuated Korea ? GENERAL MACARTHUR  - -  What I read is an extract from that report , sir . CHAIRMAN RUSSELL ? And there is no limitation on the time that it was to be put into effect , or conditions rather ? Was there any limitation that it was not to be effective unless you were compelled to evacuate Korea GENERAL MACARTHUR ? The only conditions were those I read , sir . Do you wish me to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , General did not include the opening sentence which General Marshall later put in the record as follows : " The Joint Chiefs of Staff have tentatively agreed upon the following objectives : " Instead he testified that " the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my own so far as I know were practically identical , " though later , under questioning he said that the J. C. S. had never shared his policy of bombarding Manchuria . Moreover , the Joint Chiefs testified that while their study of Jan. 12 was written at the depth of our fortunes in Korea , all of them modified their position when the tide of battle turned in our favor . The hearings , in short , may not have proved who has the right strategy , but they have underscored the vast differences of approach toward the problem and the profound lack of confidence and even suspicion on fundamental questions that existed between the Administration and its principal soldier in the Far East .
