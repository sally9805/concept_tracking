Four other armored columns cut ; harply into enemy areas . Behind I thunderous bombardment by warplanes and artillery , the tanks ' lasted Chinese and Korean Cornnunists out of hillside forts .

It pulled back voluntarily after reaching a point five miles west of Anyang against fierce resistance . Those twin-pronged drives were executing what an ? officer described as " a double envelopment within a double envelopment " It was called " the greatest exploitation of armor during the Korean war .

By Mary Hornaday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peiping 's vituperative reception of their " aggressor " resolution , leaders of the United Nations are still optimistic that the way may open up for a cease fire in Korea . Hopes for the negotiation of a truce through UN 's Good Offices Committee , soon to come into being , have not dwindled noticeably since the 1,600-word statement of Chinese Communist Premier and Foreign Minister Chou En-lai blasting the resolution as " illegal and slanderous . " The general western attitude toward the Peiping statement here was that it was exactly what was expected , since the Chinese Communist Government now is faced with the necessity of explaining to its people the " aggressor " label which 44 of the 60 United Nations voted on Jan. 30 to attach to it because of its intervention in the Korean war . Door Held Onen Ever since the United States resolution was introduced , the Chinese Communists have spread the word through friends at the UN that its passage would finally extinguish all hope of a peaceful settlement in Korea . Yet the resolution 's sponsors still are convinced that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission ? of halting war by collective security  --  than it was before the resolution was passed . All through the debate on the resolution , it was emphasized that it still leaves the door open for peace . Its western sponsors are not now going back on that conviction just because Mr. Chou thinks differently . Good Offices Unit Pushed Most concrete western reaction to the ' Peiping comment came from a British Foreign Office spokesman , who was reported here to have said , after a study of the Chou statement : " We do not consider that the Chinese have said that no negotiations are now possible . " Both Britain and the United States now are pushing . for early activation of the three-man Good Offices Committee set up in the " aggressor " resolution . By majority consent , the work of this committee will take precedence over that of the Sanctions Study Committee , on which the United States insisted . . Under the resolution passed Jan. 30 , the Sanctions Study Committee will defer its report if the Good Offices Committee reports satisfactory progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rau Refuses Post After the Chou statement , Nasrollah Entezam of Iran , president of the UN General Assembly , declared : " We should not lose , hope , and we should try to do our best to start negotiations " for an end to the Korean war . Mr. Entezam has a big job on his hands to find the two best men to serve with him on the Good Offices Committee . " This is a tremendous responsibility , " he declared . " I am doing my best to fulfill it . I am sure the two colleagues who will be . chosen , as well as the other governments and - delegations , will help to fulfill the task . " His first choices were known to be Sir Benegal N. Rau of India and Canadian Foreign Minister Lester B. Pearson . But Mr. Pearson made his acceptance conditional on the acceptance of Sir Benegal . Now word his come from India that Sir Benegal will not serve . In New Delhi , a Foreign Ministry official has said that Sir Benegal will not serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present .
