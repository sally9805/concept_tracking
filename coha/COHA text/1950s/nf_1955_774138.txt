txt  | frequency ? educators have shown how serious they are by not filing . We first get into quicksands right here . Every educator in America ? Mr. Wittcoff among them ? has heard the warning to file and file in time , and he has heard this warning many , many times . It came repeatedly from two of the commissioners of the F.C.C. , Frieda Hennock , and the commissioner 's chairman at that time , Paul Walker . The warning came again under the most sensitive and ideal conditions possible . It came at the very meeting that had invited Mr. Wittcoff to unfold his network plan . This meeting , the Television Programs Institute ( their three-day get-together was held under the auspices of the American Council on Education , and convened at Pennsylvania State College , in April , 1952 ) , produced almost all the brass ( and some of the tarnish ) that is concerned or professes to be concerned with the problem of television and education . Some very solid professionals were there : Milton S. Eisenhower , Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Walker , Davidson Dunton , William Hodapp , John S. Millis , Bob Banner , Robert B. Hudson , Martha Gable , John F. White , Richard B. Hull , Lynn Poole , Robert T. Rocke , Jr. , Ken Bartlett , Seymour Krieger , Frederick Hoeing , Franklin Dunham , George Probst , Keith Tyler , Mark Schinnerer , Robert Fenwick , Armand Hunter , Rev. Theodore Hesburgh . There were a great many others . Much of the credit for organizing and running a convention so vast ( and a convention in such seeming danger of becoming amorphous ) belongs to Carroll V. Newsom . In addition to serving as the Institute 's director , Mr. Newsom is New York State 's Associate Commissioner for Higher Education . When Paul Walker , then head of the F.C.C. , finished a formal speech , in which he urged educators to meet the challenge of television , he received an ovation . Newsom informed the audience that the commissioner would answer questions . Here is one of the first questions put to him : " We understand that during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intention to develop the television stations . Would you be able to specify what the Commission would consider valid evidence ? Do you mean money " ? Mr. Walker 's answer : " We mean whether or not these allocations are to be used . Evidence of intention to use an allocation is the filing of an applica- tion . Another evidence is the showing of some responsibility to hack up that application . " The subject of Mr. Walker 's address was " The Time to Act Is Now . " That was the keynote for his own speech , as well as the compelling purpose of the gathering . Time was running out . Education had fifteen months left ; no more . And 242 channels were on the block . Here are Commissioner Walker 's closing sentences : " To you members of the American Council of Education , and to all the educators of America , I say that the tide is in . If you do not take it at its flood , you may foreclose yourselves forever from the full utilization of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you take on this weighty responsibility , as you begin the crucial battle ahead , you take with you our heartfelt wishes for all success . " How was the crucial battle waged ? Practically nobody filed . The one-year period of grace ran out . Education 's showing was so meager that the period had to be extended . This has n't done much good either . As I sit at this typewriter we have gone over into 1954 , and how many educators do you think there are who have taken advantage of " their rightful heritage " ? Twenty-six . Most educators want it done without having to do it . Serious thought has been given to the problem of teaching by microphone and by people who knew more about microphones than they did about teaching . They knew more about reaching the public by the use of the human voice . As far back as 1939 the enlistment of broadcasters of many kinds and experience was sought by educators , and the broadcasters made vigorous efforts to bring the two forces together . The area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as it was for radio then ? was as follows : the educators wanted to use radio as a powerful extension of classroom influences without going through the exertions of learning anything new . One of the first new things that had to be learned ( and swallowed ) was that most of the educators were themselves unfit for the enterprise . They were themselves unfit as broadcasters . Most educators could project little when they had to do their projecting into a microphone . Most of them either would n't admit  | it , or refused to think of this defect , or this insufficiency , as the true core of the whole problem . Even so , some progress was made . And sensible things were said about the problem on both sides of the effort . CBS was very actively concerned with the problem . Many of its executives and officials ( by 1939 ) gave of their own time to teach what they knew , and received very small fees for the time this took . I was one of these : I started the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quotation that has obvious and timely application to the problem now confronting educators who would use TV as a teaching instrument in pretty much the same way they wished to use radio for teaching some fifteen years ago . The following words were written in 1939 . See if they do not also represent the TV problem as we encounter it during the present : " What shall we put on the air ? There does exist today , throughout the entire country , and in many hundreds of separate places , tremendous and neglected opportunities for good educational shows that are not now on the air . I specifically refer to colleges and universities , and to what they could represent as potential sources for new broadcast energies ; and I refer also to the two or three men and women on every faculty , in every college , who should be giving to their entire countryside what is now being restricted to the few in their classrooms . These two or three people are the born teachers and lecturers on every faculty . " Carl Becker of Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is needed . Undergraduates , whether they were taking his courses or not , regularly mobbed his amphitheatre . The man had great imagination and magic . He could make history thrilling , and in so doing , he demonstrated many times each week ? on his own campus ? what the broadcasters have been reiterating to the educators since the very day educational forces decided they deserved a share of radio time in which to teach . " They do not deserve any such thing until they know how to use it . Who does know how ? And what public would they be serving , if such great teachers could be found and delivered ? ( They listened to Becker because they wanted to . ) " If we accept the thousands of individuals who cram the summer  | sessions of our universities ; if we accept the people who take courses of every sort in every place they are being offered : if we accept these people as evidence of the great American desire to be . educated , we must accept also radio 's failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical and satisfying diet . " I believe , for example , that there could be such a thing as a network extension university ; that such a network of the air could attract and hold and nourish and stimulate a vast body of listeners . " I believe there could be such a thing but I doubt if it ever happens . Networks must , by their very nature , be kept fluid , and anything calling for such positive and continued stabilization as a regular university course , over such a long period of time , could never be guaranteed by a large number of stations operating simultaneously . Commercial demands and the uncertainties of the international situation occasion too many interruptions and cancellations . " If anything like a university extension program series is to be undertaken , it will have to be the responsibility of local stations , in cooperating with nearby colleges and universities . This is already being done in some localities , mostly on campuses that have their own transmission facilities . But it is not yet general throughout the country . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Intensive cooperation between local stations and neighboring or available college faculties is the greatest immediate contribution educational broadcasters can make to the publics they wish to serve . " Look , for example , at the annual migration of adults to summer sessions . This is a true symptom of the trouble to which people will go to find out more than they now know . And much of what they find out is told to them by professionals who are trained to do this work . Much of what they find out is told to them . That is the important thing . " One of education 's greatest forces is the lecture and the lecture-hall . Many courses ? certainly most courses of greatest cultural interest , and indeed many also of great practical worth ? are successfully delivered to students everywhere ? at the rate of three times a week ? by the ancient and honorable method of telling the students things which they did not know before .  | " Culture exists anywhere there is an informed and discriminating intelligence . An educated man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever sort ; and who recognizes and enjoys an intellectual problem of whatever sort ; and who seeks to protect the first and solve the second . Culture , whatever your own definition of it may be , is all over the place . Probably it exists more numerously and more permanently in the faculties of American schools and colleges than it does in any other part of American life . " Because these arc the people who now concern us most ; because these are the speaking instruments who concern us most , it seems sensible to propose that much can be accomplished by bringing to the microphones those men and women of our schools and colleges who are known by their colleagues and their students to have superior gifts as lecturers . " And to let these people speak . " All literature can be delivered by radio ; all of history . And biography . These can be done now , by known and proven techniques . They can be done cheaply and simply . They can be done by good talk ; by the few now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy greater respect , and gathering importance , when they are delivered as courses or in series ; when they are true supplements to standard courses making up the essential parts of the curricula that are more or less the same throughout the whole of the nation . " As true courses , or as true supplements to courses and offered in series , college and university faculty members , lecturing on the air , with the materials of their years of study , will in time develop momentum of great force and of steadily accumulating meaning . They will begin to mean something very considerable , to whole communities of listeners , when a series of thirty lectures adds up to an intelligent and sympathetic understanding of the history of the Jews in Babylon , or of Restoration Comedy , or of old Ben Franklin . " When university broadcasting stations and local stations , with the force of adjacent faculties , become radio extensions of the universities themselves , rather than amateur imitations of the networks ; when these faculties and stations appraise and put to work the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first  | microphone on the desk of the best lecturer and not on the desk of the greatest scholar ; and when surrounding controls insist that this man and this microphone be left undisturbed for a half-hour , three times a week , at the same time , and for an entire semester , this happy marriage can announce itself as having started . We shall begin to be effective as educators , and in a climate where these two mighty forces can expand and flourish . " I was personally and professionally much concerned with this problem . I studied it and worried about it and lectured on it . And I wrote the above words at a time when any slight lifting of the distractions of commercial broadcasting would have been very welcome indeed . It is now here once more . And I welcome it again . I hope Mr. Wittcoff is not angered by these comments . I care about these things and I want to see them come out right . Why educators failed in radio will be argued for many a day . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be popular . They may not be right . But I believe they are right , and I also believe ? in view of the expensiveness of television ? that it is time some of these sacred cows either stand still for milking or be led to a pen where the disposal ceremony is hardly artistic but where whatever is consumable is put in shape for the consumer , and put on the popular market .  | MANY EDUCATORS WILL NEVER GET WHAT THEY WANT OUT OF TV , BUT most of them will positively get what they deserve . There will be many who wo n't get what they want because they wo n't start their adventure with the most important truth of all : there is an emotional content to all public successes . There must be feeling They will get the public acceptance they deserve ? no more , no less ? because and only because the average American livingroom is the greatest equalizer that we have . If Americans do n't know what 's good for them ? as the educators have so often said ? Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " new truth " that the faculty must now face . Thus far , they 've funked it and that 's why they have thus far flunked . Many know this now and are looking ahead so they wo n't repeat the mistake they made in radio . A curious thing happens when you walk up to a professor , tell him that what he 's doing is exciting and important , and that you want to put his knowledge on the air . For a moment it pleases him beyond measure . Before long , though , fear sets in . And doubt . Then suspicion . It is n't the " intimidation " Mr. Hutchins finds ( and there is indeed much ) . It 's hard to tell just what it is , but the man usually flees , out of modesty , perhaps , or disbelief , or even fear of academic reprisal . And if you do n't believe such things exist you have been staying too close to home .  | The first serious effort to unite the energies of a network with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was CBS . The university was Chicago . The show was first known as " The Human Adventure , " a good title . Later , under sponsorship ? Revere Copper and Brass , I think ? it was called " Exploring the Unknown . " A writer named Anne Barley ( author of Patrick Calls Me Mother ) and I were sent to Chicago to shake out this idea and convert it into a show . We had worked together before , having been the original dialog team for the first " March of Time " shows . We were given space and privileges , plus free access to the faculty . The faculty was polite , preoccupied , and unresponsive . We could not get very much out of them . They became plainly suspicious of us the instant they realized we had found them interesting or exciting . When they realized this ? that we intended to build dramatic scenes from facts and ideas they had given us in the form of lecture notes , they became frightened . They fled . What came from there came later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe they felt we were exploiting them , or that we were about to ( which indeed we were ! ) , but instead of feeling needed or ennobled or put to greater public use , they felt invaded ; they felt vaguely unsettled . They felt their dignity was in peril . Very soon talking to the faculty was like talking to public buildings . Results came mostly from the efforts of one man ? Sherman Dryer ? and mostly through research got the hard way . For a long time Dryer tried to help us but he too gave up on the faculty . He went ahead with the thing anyhow and succeeded . He hired professional research people . He came to New York . The show was then re-titled : " Exploring the Unknown . " I wrote a couple of shows for him . That was my first experience with trying to get a university to make its knowledge and its multifaceted manpower available to radio . It was about two decades ago . Miss Barley and I saw quite a bit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a good deal , too , of the amazing William Benton ( then less well known to the public than he is today , but no less energetic ) . It has occurred to me that I probably failed somewhere along the line . It has also occurred to me that Mr. pl08 Hutchins ( then Chancellor ) was , from the aspect of human personality , one of the most impressive Americans alive ( he still is ) , that Mr. Benton is one of the nation 's most entrenched talkers ( there is a geological durability about the Benton monologue ) , and that these two forces , rather than freeing a faculty for new and strange endeavors in radio , froze it up . People stop talking when Hutchins enters a room . He is truly that sort of man , in poise , presence , size , authority , and untouchability . He seems seven feet tall and looks like a clean gray building . Children would never think of going anywhere near him . If people stop talking when Hutchins enters a room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense in trying to talk with Benton around . And you can hear him coming . He 's clear , positive , perpetual , self-approving , goodnatured , short , fearless , blunt , combative , happy and always very much to the point . The point is usually himself and his next plan . Even though the plan is good ( and most of his ideas are ) this gets very sticky after ten minutes . I am not surprised that faculty members do n't " spark " around these men . Yet both of them tried to help us . Somehow they just did n't seem to be able to . Benton likes to feel he 's the most interesting thing in the room . Often he is , depending on who else is there . Hutchins is disturbed by no such doubt , he knows he is . ( And it is invariably true . ) They were a great team , possibly too great . ( Is it possible that they sometimes suffocated when they wanted to inspire ? ) Between the two , they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasable intellectualism that America has for sale , Hutchins with the " Great Books " ( $249 installed ) , and Benton the Encyclopaedia Britannica which is going for $288 . Most university administrators have the hope or the flush of assurance that there must be something in and around their university that the public needs and should be getting . This is a good sign . Too many times in years past , however , it has been left for radio to supply whatever it was that the public was to get . " We 've done this much " has been an attitude that many radio men have found when they 've come to a campus to put on an  | educational program ? " you take it from here . " Some have leaned back against the library . Others have withheld support till they found how the broadcasts were received according to the papers ( any radio man will corroborate this ) . All hope an honorable thing is occurring but somehow do n't believe it . The reception that radio has often enjoyed has been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , once in , they 're in all the way . ) Educators may not be so difficult before the cameras as they have been mound mikes in the last twenty years . TV uncovers errors much faster and " playbacks " on kinescopes are pretty cruel critics . This raises the interesting point about professors being spoiled ( as many are without knowing it ) , in that they do n't constantly have to keep changing their act . Some of them wo n't like to hear that they are spoiled and with fair logic might counter with the charge that " whodunits " do n't change their act either . And this would be true . These arguments never get anywhere . Few arguments do . As to the whodunits , we know that American audiences have an unusual absorptiveness for entertainment of many kinds , and such changing as does occur in the plotting and the general presentation-pattern of whodunits is enough to keep them vital , even if speciously so , and even if you do n't like that kind of vitality . Educators not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it as an act . They should begin to do this though , the instant they contemplate any off-campus peddling of their virtuosities . They do n't think of their lecture-hall as a " house " in the theatrical sense . They do n't have to do this because they know they 'll draw a house year after year ; often draw new audiences every semester . They are spoiled in the exact way many vaudeville performers were spoiled , till radio and talking pictures brought a new brand of realism into their lives . When they suddenly had to change their act , and keep changing it , what happened ? Some could and did . Some could n't and died . Most of them just died . So with professors and TV . They are spoiled , not in terms of competence ( for their competence is real ) but in terms of security , which is false because it is only temporary . Only a few in vaudeville had the inventiveness , the industry , the stamina , the stomach , or , more particularly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brice 's sewing-machine act lasted her , unchanged , for many years . So did an act that included the importunate brat at the Coney Island Beach , one with a tagline that made more than a million dollars : " Why did n't you think of that when you were in the water ! " She had a great career after vaudeville ? she had a different act every Friday . She got writers to write it for her . Or rather Young Sc Rubicam did . Or rather Harry Ackerman and I did when we were at Young &; Rubicam . The celebrated song-and-dance team of William Rack and Frances White ? beautiful tap-dancers both of them , and excellent singers ? practically owned the Palace any time they appeared . They turned new numbers into hits , but they did n't actually use many new ones , or " use up " much written material . They did n't need to . When vaudeville died , they died with it . About all they had was the one thing . So with Nora Bayes and Jack Norworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deagan , and Helen Broderick and Steve Crawford . Time took its toll in here , of course , but Block and Sully made a big " try " with radio ( when Gertrude Niesen was just starting to " go " and Paul Douglas was becoming the best-known commercial voice and straight-man at CBS ) . Probably the most conspicuous success in making intelligent accommodations through all these perplexing vicissitudes is that of Burns and Allen . It is indeed a great deal tougher now . There have been hundreds of forgotten performers in radio who could sing better than William Rack and Frances White ( Bill Perry and Evelyn McGregor , just to mention a pair that are no longer together but far from forgotten ) . There are scores in TV right now who can dance better . There have been so many , in fact , that stand-outs no longer stand out . To many in television it therefore seems an almost unthinkable ingratitude , an almost heroic naivete , that critics today can knock Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca . There is so much talent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that many critics have not had the perception to realize that these two people were the most gifted team of comedians in the history of American entertainment . They were given an assign- ment beyond the power of genius to fulfil . But they did fill it , for five years and better . They will lose much of their meaning when they split up . Neither alone can be what they were together . Everything in radio and television is free . That is probably the main reason it all gets so cruelly kicked around . If Jascha Heifetz played every night in Carnegie Hall and if no admission were ever charged , he would be an artistic burn in a month . He would n't disappear , neither would his skill , but the magic that is created by the mention of his name would go . He knows this . So sometimes he makes us wait a couple of years before we can hear him again . It is the way of the world . Educators , when they do get into television ? and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have some painful collisions with a thing called ingratitude . Do you know how dangerous it is to give things away ? Those in television know . They are insulted every day . It was the same with radio . Radio and television are tied to a whipping-post in the town square , and the town is permitted to add a stripe each time a citizen passes . It can only happen where things are given away . This has been going on since the beginning of man . It is one of his attributes . It is n't confined to Americans . Man is a congenital reader of price-tags . For example , are we , as Americans , more loved or less loved , more respected or less so , by the world at large for our benefactions to it ? We are hated for it , we are held in disrespect , we are misinterpreted . We are n't hated because we are feared but because our benefactions cost so little to the beneficiary that they carry no reminder value at all . They carry no obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world just now with the exception of Greece . Benefactions of this nature and condition ( the unconditional ) are taken with little thought and less thanks . They can even be taken in contempt . And they are . Professors will find that TV audiences have not been holding their community breath while waiting for education to speak . A good example of this in another field , and an embarrassment not yet composed , currently confronts some of our most thoughtful and psychologically enlightened officials in the United States Civil Defense . Educators will run into this ( in their special way )  | as soon as they begin to be seen and heard , and it describes in specific outline what happens when you get something for nothing . Here was the hypothesis for the Civil Defense : Suppose the Russians try to destroy us with nerve gas ? The United States Army has developed some useful countermeasures for this emergency , including gas masks and atropine injectors . If you had them and used them correctly , you might survive a nerve-gas attack by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival in attack . But how are you going to get the average American to keep track of his gas mask ? How can you teach him to use his injector ? Should we warn citizens of this danger and give him this protection against it ? Perhaps . But would this work ? Probably not . It probably would n't work for Americans , and it has already failed to work for the British . When the British Government , fearing such an attack toward the end of World War II , issued masks as a gift from the government , all the English for once behaved very much like anybody else . The English usually behave better than other peoples . This time they did n't . They lost their gas masks . They let the children play with them . They let their dogs chew them up . Soon the masks were all full of holes , or lost , or just thrown out . The professors are in the physical presence of this transition . It is an interesting one , calling for enormous adaptive power on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , and working before an audience that pays nothing and criticizes all the time . This will be very tough on the educators , but it will also be very toughening . And those who survive it will be valuable , enduringly . The necessity for changing the act , of sharpening it , and keeping it new and fresh and attractive will be responded to by the few . Without knowing it , professors ? teachers of every type and grade ? have been in vaudeville all their lives , playing different houses each day , each season . But never playing new towns . There was no need to travel . Audiences came to them . The reason that few will change the way they do things now is because it is too late . They ca n't . They like it the way it is now . So long as they like it this way , it and they will stay as they are now . There was a time when this was safe . There was a time when  | it was most profitable . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lecture . How could he get rich on just the one property ? Easy . He gave the same lecture more than io , 000 times ! He could reel it out as many as four times in one day . Who listened ? More than io , 000 different audiences . All over America . With that lecture you could n't miss . I 've read it . He just told his audience it was their right and their duty to go right out and get busy and become extremely rich . It was called " Acres of Diamonds . " Conwell got rich on it . He founded Temple University . Could Conwell do this now ? No . Neither can educators . That day is past , even with a spiel as irresistibly commercial as " Acres . " Today the educator , who , in TV , will be primarily a lecturer , must keep improving , and adding , and inventing , and cutting , and bringing up to date . In television you are never done . And your audience is never satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you 'll be getting it . That is toughening . Educators will have a much clearer idea of television , of what it is , what it demands , and what it throws back , once they begin to use it , to stand before it and talk in its presence as they now talk in their own classes . This seems a proper place to put a serious challenge not only to all those who believe in the institution of the Great Books but to all those who claim they do . The total , I fear , will include more suet than brains , but the issue keeps coming up . This may be a good place , too , to take a square look at " culture , " intellectualism , and Great Aims that are being urged on us all these days . In Aims of Education , by Alfred North Whitehead , there are several interesting ideas , but there are a few that are so exactly of a kind I find depressing and hurtful ( if we tried to apply them to television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , of course , certain types of educated people that no one can endure . Now , while many of us might accept Mr. Whitehead 's estimate of a certain type of educated person who answers before hearing the question ( Whitehead 's own sentence is : " A merely well-informed man is the most useless bore on God 's earth " ) , more of us would like to add this : that if we are gaging degrees of  | boredom ? and much normal living is perforce so spent ? it is probably more boring to be bored by the uninformed than by the well-informed . This statement would appear to be true even when neither the informed nor the uninformed man is trying to communicate with us , for then we may wonder ( if the informed man is quiet ) what he may be thinking ; while in the case of the uninformed man , we are merely grateful that no sound is coming out of him . Whitehead , to be sure , was speaking of culture , and he had some good phrases for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beauty and humane feeling . " However , I feel he was wrong in his belief that the experience of television ? had he known of it ? might be " a passive review of disconnected ideas . " It is one of education 's common criticisms of TV . Surely it can not be " passive " to a man or woman ( or child ) who is capable of responses other than passive . If we lifted the notion from this application and applied it to other segments in our living , even such segments as those that are under supervision and that are consecutive by compulsion ? a day in school , for example , or a day in college classrooms ( just to make the segment correspond to a familiar clustering of " disconnected " ideas ) ? the ideas there are necessarily disconnected , just as they are in TV when programs change , with a student moving from one to another all day . It 's not only that way in television , but in life , too , is n't it ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbroken sequence of the disconnected , held together by time and reflection ? By individual capacity for productive reasoning when alone ? What could it be other than this ? The factors of disconnectedness and of passiveness , while they may be coeval , are unrelated ; and passiveness belongs to individuals , never to systems . And to say that a man is " merely " well-informed is putting such stress on this crumbling adverb as Mr. Wittcoff , in the preceding chapter , put on it when he minuetted right past the main event of all educational television : the creation of good materials . Anything that takes the better part of a lifetime , as does an honest effort to be well-informed ; or anything that takes so many brains and so much time and talent that it has never yet been properly done ( the building of a pool of fine educational  | material for television 's use ) , in the judgment of any man who has worked hard at either , is merely terrific . True , Mr. Whitehead was writing an essay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive exercises , both of them . Here neither man is really trying to ride the surf ; just sun-bathing . This withdrawal from life , rather than a head-on meeting with it , is one of the troublesome features in what Mr. Hutchins generously wants for all of us in the way of education . In order to have what he feels is our Utopian due , or objective , the one thing needed more than any other single factor ? and never mentioned by Mr. Hutchins as being desirable ? is a private income . We would all love to read and meditate and live like Sacheverell Sitwell ( or Hutchins ) , if we had the time . But for most Americans , whether on the giving or receiving end of education , a persistent man keeps showing up who wants money . So most of us have to get up and get out and keep moving . Mr. Hutchins is in a century unsuited to his pace and temper , unresponsive to his special glitter ; so he has done what the English do when caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and been boldly anachronistic with the calendar . But Mr. Hutchins ' hideaway , with its epistemological redan , its teleological moat system , and propaedeutical drawbridge , is no haven to most of the rest of us . It is a barricade . However , I doubt with humble seriousness ? having in years past been a great respecter of the Hutchins energy and the Hutchins individualism ( and I still am ) ? whether he can add a gill to the reservoir television is looking for and trying to fill ; add anything that would make its content more potable to the American people as a whole . Or that he would especially want to . Alas , his own private stock of elixir is not only made in secret but consumed at home , and if he has a spare bottle at the end of the year , he probably sends it over to Sacheverell Sitwell . The trouble with Robert Maynard Hutchins is that he is a million miles from the nearest human being . Gilbert Seldes does n't want to talk to you unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start there , and work your way back toward the Chaldees . One of the clearest statements about the workability of the  | Great Books Foundation plan for reading and discussion appeared in 1950 in the Saturday Review of Literature . Ben Ray Redman wrote the statement . He did n't believe that the curriculum was right . To support his position he gave the reader the Foundation 's list of the Great Books to be read during the first year : 1 . Declaration of Independence ; Old Testament ( I Kings 21 Samuel , 11 , 12 ) . 2 . Plato : " Apology , " " Crito. " 3 . Plato " Republic , " Books I-II. 4 . Thucydides : " History , " Selections . 5 .

" Mr. Redman makes this comment on the list : " This first-year program gives a fair idea of the character of the whole four-year scheme : the emphasis is heavily on the ancients rather than the moderns ; few works of later date than the eighteenth century find a place among the Great Books ; there is little history , and the most recent event dealt with by a historian is the rise of Christianity .... " Then , a few paragraphs later : " But , even granting that the curriculum is right , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative side , for several reasons : " ( I ) I do not believe that every person of average intelligence  | can , unaided and without previous training , read any and all of the Great Books . " ( 2 ) I do believe that many , if not most , of the Great Books can not be , read intelligently without supplementary information or tutorial explanation , both of which are unnecessary according to the spokesmen for the Foundation . " ( 3 ) I am sure that the requirements for successful group leadership are much rarer than the Foundation 's directors and regional representatives would like to believe . " ( 4 ) I am far from sure that the so-called Socratic method is the most efficient way of learning for students whose time is strictly limited . " On the scheme 's workability : " I can not believe that the average member of the average Great Books group would not be better employed in giving four hours a week to modern history or the world 's best novels or the best modern poetry or biographies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending four hours a week ? to take a few titles at random ? on Calvin 's Institutes , ' Lucretius ' On the Nature of Things , ' Montaigne 's Apology for Raimond de Sebonde , ' Bacon 's Novum Organum , ' Aquinas 's Treatise on Law , ' Hobbes 's Leviathan , ' or Descartes ' Discourse on Method . ' And I am sure that the same average reader would be far more sensibly employed in reading a series of modern popular scientific textbooks than in sitting at the venerable feet of Hippocrates , Lavoisier , Harvey , and Galileo . Indeed , my certainty in this matter is fortified by high authority , for Bertrand Russell has said : ' I think the " Best Hundred Books " people are utterly absurd on the scientific side . The broad rule is : historical approach where truth is unattainable , but not in a subject like mathematics or anatomy ( they read Harvey ! ) . ' " In a reply to Mr. Redman , Mr. Raymond Wittcoff runs down one list of questions that belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and question-begging assertions that belong in no reasoned discussion of anything at all , and produces still a third list of conclusions that verge on the puerile in their presumptiveness . He becomes cross and illogical . " Mr. Redman argues for predominantly modern selections , "  | argues Mr. Wittcoff . " Can he offer a list of contemporary writings which could match the wisdom of thirty centuries " ? ( No , Mr. Wittcoff , he can not do that , but that is not what he 's trying to do . ) " Mr. Redman calls for more modern history . General Marshall has said : ' I doubt seriously whether a man can think with full wisdom and deep conviction regarding certain of the basic international issues today who has not at least reviewed in his mind the period of the Peloponnesian War . ' " ( Reviewing the Peloponnesian War was of help to General George Marshall , but we do not learn what help it was to Mr. Wittcoff nor what it might do for us , were we also to review it . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books are great . ' Who would not wish to know the best thoughts of the finest minds of all the ages ' ? he asks . He simply denies that average man can do it , and he offers as evidence for his cynical conclusion a report on one Great Books meeting which he attended . He observed that the group talked all around the subject , ' digressed , stalled , matched ignorance against ignorance , and bobbed up with the most bizarre personal opinions and prejudices . ' Frankly , we have observed these difficulties in the early discussions of some of our St. Louis groups , but we know that the same terms could be used to describe the way these same people deliberate about crucial personal and political questions at home and at work . " ( Your last sentence , sir , is Mr. Redman 's own argument for his basic reservation about the whole thing : " Only carefully selected groups of intelligent , well-prepared members can get much benefit from the program . " ) " Mr. Redman 's basic objection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Of course , Mr. Redman knows that most of us have plenty of time on our hands now that the work week has been shortened . However , television might put an end to all reading unless the magazine publishers can provide us with a condensation of Quick . " Mr. Wittcoff is a little harsh on television here , and even tougher on Quick ( in fact he may have killed it with that refer- ence , for it folded soon after ) , but he is now in an ideal position to put to the test his own enthusiasms and his real belief that the Great Books are , indeed , for all the people . Mr. Wittcoff is the recipient of the St. Louis 1953 Award for Outstanding Civic Contribution . The FCC has awarded Channel 9 ( KETC ) to St. Louis . Mr. Wittcoff 's plan for an educational network may not materialize according to its present outline , but if the municipal schedule is as innocent of program material as was his plan for the nation , St. Louis could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the general dispersion and discussion of their contents , by putting on once a week ( or once every two weeks ) a series of Great Books groups in typical informal discussion get-togethers . If Mr. Wittcoff ( and Messrs . Hutchins , Stringfellow Barr , Mortimer Adler , the late John Erskine , the study groups in more than 50o towns and cities in the United States and Canada , British Columbia , and the faculty of St. Johns ) is right ? if these books are comprehensible , and if the comprehension of their contents is interesting , this television series will reveal that fact . I would doubt they ever get around to doing it . If they did try it , though , then some of the skepticism of Ben Ray Redman ( and not " cynicism , " Mr. Wittcoff ) might take on some meaning . We might find out what the public wanted in this regard , and how much the public could take . My own views are n't important , but Robert Shayon , referred to many times in this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own book to italicize one of his own thoughts on television . Here is the thought : " There will be no more educational intent and content in commercial TV than there is now until more people show a preference for it . " I agree with this , and if Mr. Wittcoff points out that Mr. Shayon is talking about commercial television he will find after his first show that education 's problem is the same one the commercial side is also lacing ( and the circulation manager of Quick ) . It is the same problem anyone has who wishes to address himself to other people . It is audience . By what happy windfall of serendipity will Station KETC find an audience for Thucydides ? I am a fairly good man around the Peloponnesus myself , but it is my notion that if you mention  | Thucydides to the average man he will give you a swift look and walk away . He may even report you . It would be interesting to know the pulling-power of Thucydides when he 's at the mercy of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting this program on , we could at least find out one fact : do TV audiences like informal discussions of the " Great Books " ? It is Ben Ray Redman 's fear that they wo n't like it because they wo n't " get " it , even if they 're given it . But to keep the present argument within reference borders familiar to all , would n't the " Great Books " have more chance for an audience if the audience were made up of viewers who had been somewhat preconditioned for the discipline which these books require ? A conditioning that might have been developed , say , through regular listening to all of the radio programs that Lyman Bryson has presided over in the great series " Invitation to Learning " ? Everyone presented in this series knows what he is talking about . That is why he was brought there . The experts change as the books under discussion are changed , the assumption being that no man , however bright , knows all things . Too many people who are today discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know what they are talking about because they do n't know what the books are talking about . They have n't read enough or thought enough . They are not " up " to it . That their leader may be almost anybody and that he may not interpret the books seems to me an almost disastrous way to start . What is he there for ? Would n't a pointer do as well ? It is too dreadfully like the first fall rehearsal of the high school band ? 3o new pieces of brass , a couple of veteran tuba players who did n't graduate , and no drum-major . Mr. Whitehead mentioned the " well-informed " bore . My candidate for the title would be the man who thinks he is thinking . I can not see where television has any responsibility to feed to any community a small group of its own citizens for the practicehour of finger-work and sight-reading , especially with no one on hand to correct wrong notes . I see no order to it , only the threat of repeating discord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They believe in ideas in St. Louis ; they have a lot of initiative ; they have an unusually responsive citizenry ; they have an educational television station , money , time , and two million potential  | viewers . They have Washington University and St. Louis University , and a really first-class mayor in Joseph M. Darst . They have the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , and many thousands of people reading the Great Books , and reading them on a scheduled basis . Raymond Wittcoff is one of their most prominent leaders in both the business and cultural affairs of the city . Citizens ' committees , in a drive to raise money for KETC , in a single night got better than 8o percent response in public subscriptions from homes visited . Here 's what the Post-Dispatch said : " St. Louis believes in education . It knows the dramatic power of televison . This power should be used to bring our area the best of ideas that civilization has produced . " If these ideas really are in the Great Books , and if St. Louis people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own profit , why do n't they do the bold thing that all these convergences suggest ? If it 's genuine , it will succeed in television . If , though , it is not ; if it is a temporary wave of civic enthusiasm that is hiding intellectual bloat , television will record that also . It is that honest , and that impersonal . In my judgment , the " Great Books of the Western World " will fail in television and " Invitation to Learning " will succeed in television ( as it has succeeded in radio ) because there is both sense and order in " Invitation " ; sense in bringing to the microphones very special people ( not just anybody who wants to come and talk ) , people who are experts on the contents of a given book as editors or critics or teachers , or who can relate it to its own period historically , or to the forces around it that provoked or created it as a book . They bring the weight of comparison to these cultural hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's series , and have earned this right by study , by experience , by wide reading generally and intensive reading in the field that makes up that week 's interest . They know a tremendous lot about the subject . No dummies are allowed . I call this sense . As to order , books on " Invitation to Learning " fall into groupings of related interests . A whole quarter cycle ( 13 weeks ) will be devoted to " Adventure , " or " Travel , " or " Man and 2 On whose faculty , to the enduring credit of this city , is Dr. Kurt von Schnschnigg , former Chancellor of Austria ? a man Hitler could never break .  | Nature , " or " Great Books About Women . " " Great Books About Women , " for example , included : Trollope 's Orley Farm , the Books of Ruth and Esther , Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice , Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler , the letters of Mme.

As to who appeared on these programs ( and for what specific books ) , here arc some interesting notes , far from formal ( because I 'm putting them down as they come back to memory from shows I 've heard and enjoyed ) that will give the reader more detail of what I mean by " se-ase " in the selection of those who are to talk and discuss : For Goethe 's Faust , Henry Hatfield , Associate Professor of German at Columbia ( and author of a critical study of Thomas Mann ) , and George Shuster , President of Hunter College . For James Joyce 's Ulysses , William G. Rogers , literary editor of the Associated Press ( and author of When You See This , Remember Me , a book about Gertrude Stein ) ; and William Y.

Douglas ( author of Beyond the High Himalayas ) ; and Richard J.

That 's about how it goes in Lyman Bryson 's " Invitation to Learning . " Sense and order . This long series has covered many of the titles that Robert Maynard Hutchins ( and his board ) have included in the " Great Books , " but Bryson needs ( and supplies ) more elbow-room . Or so it does soberly seem to me . He will move from Anabasis to Kidnapped , but he will honor , on the way , Plato , Descartes , Rousseau , Herodotus , Dante , Socrates , Dostoyevsky , and the Koran . Are the " Great Books " dead ? Of course not . It is the method of introducing them that is dead . It is passe . It is doctrinaire . It is stuffy . It is conceited . It is intellectually deliquescent . It is arbitrary , stiff-necked , and uninspiring . Amateurs will kill the " Great Books " in television .

It is sympathy and affection and humor .  | THIS CHAPTER WILL DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF WHAT TELEVISION is doing to American adult reading . The chapter which follows will look into this problem and some related ones , particularly that of juvenile delinquency and the parts that television ( and parents ) are playing there . New facts and new reports are coming in all the time . I believe a fair and representative sampling of them is contained in this book . I would recommend two things to the reader , especially if the reader is a teacher ; one is that he or she keep track of the regular releases that come from the ingenuity of Dr. Paul Witty of Northwestern . The other is to get on the mailing list of the Television Information Committee 's reports . This Committee is a serious one , and is an in-law of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " with this problem , since it goes on developing each month , requires regular reviewing ; the TIC does this with accuracy and dependability . As to Dr. Witty , his contributions are unique . And so is the man . My enthusiasm for what he is and does must not be taken as meaning that the equally serious labors of other educators are without value , but it does mean that this man was among the very first to see the importance of periodic sampling and periodic reporting on a regular basis , and from the same area .  | Paul Witty 's work is already well known to most of the educators in this country . He is a prominent psychologist . He is one of America 's leading experts on reading . He is Professor of Education at Northwestern . Ancillary to his studies in reading and psychology has been the whole subject of the mass media of communication . He has become expert in this as well , and it was this interest that led him , more or less inevitably I would suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There does indeed seem to be a large group in the United States which believes that television is consuming so much of our leisure time that reading has ceased to be fashionable . There are some who fear it will destroy reading as a pastime , or reading for self-improvement of any kind ; who believe that reading , as we used to know it and experience it and think of it twenty years ago , is all over . To be sure , many other invasive factors come in for their share of responsibility , comics right now getting more of the criticism than they perhaps deserve . Many will argue the other way . There are people who want to believe the worst of TV , just as there are people who want to believe the worst of comics . These people see evil in both . And there may be and probably is evil in both . It is hard to offer such people anything they can not and do not see evil in , if they find that many are deriving pleasure from it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen off since the advent of television , they rush about telling editors and public meetings and committee rooms that television is smothering reading , that books are dying . They see ruin of some sort ahead for us all . It is possible that television is an enemy of reading , but in several years of patient poking about at this problem , I can not unearth much that looks like it . Right here , for example , on the question of the sale of books and the falling-off of sales , we find the figure to be so small as to have no measurable significance . And we find that the reading of books as contrasted to sale of books is so lively and so much on the increase that it is overcompensating for the loss in books bought , at least as far as cultural intake is concerned . Critics of television do n't mention the reading of books , though the reading of them ? whether on a  | loan-or-own basis ? was doubtless in the authors ' minds during the hours of their preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting the go-by because of television . In this chapter a close look at this situation is taken and a true finding is arrived at . Book critics , reviewers , librarians , and sales people ? as well as numerous publishers who are well known to me personally , have been tapped for their opinions and I have put down what I found and what they reported . Investigators , some of them with reluctance , are coming to know the truth , as this truth seems to be developing . Americans are reading more than they ever did . What are the stimuli ? And what are the readers ' choices ? Some suggestions ( and they are not more than suggestions ) have been provided by Harry N. Peterson , the District Librarian in Washington . " Television has not cut down library circulation of books , " he tells us , speaking for the nation 's capital , in his official report ( August 1st , 1953 ) . " On the other hand , the tendency has been to increase circulation of books dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been featured on Television shows . And to decrease circulation of pot-boiler ' fiction . " Other interesting statements from Mr. Peterson 's report included the following : 1 . Use of library facilities is growing despite the increased number of TV sets . There is an increased use of library books , periodicals , films , and records . 2 . " Author Meets the Critics " ( TV ) usually creates an immediate demand at the libraries for the book under discussion . 3 . Television dramatizations of well-known classics , including significant novels and Shakespearean plays , stimulate library requests for such works . 4 . The **30;1283;TOOLONG Division of the library reports that TV appearances of such authorities as Bishop Fulton Sheen and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale stimulate requests for their books . So do television interviews with such people as Poet Robert Frost and Architect Frank Lloyd Wright . 5.  | 6 . The Music Division of the library has experienced a growing demand for opera scores as a resut of TV musical offerings . 7 . District of Columbia reading records in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Readers seem to be turning from " science fiction " to books on exploration , travel , information , and natural history . 8 . There has been an increase in the library popularity of poetry , philosophy , and history . 9 . When a change in the charge-out period from 14 days to 28 days ( with concurrent elimination of the renewal period ) is taken into consideration , library circulation in the District has increased 37,050 withdrawals over the year ending June 30 , 1952 . This is encouraging but there is nothing especially startling here . There is not much that is truly startling in any of the figures and the statements that will be encountered in this and the next chapter , but there is a cumulative force that should displace the fears so many have held regarding what television has done to reading . The brief excerpts from the Peterson report ( for Washington , D.C. ) , while not matched by figures from the New York Public Library , do correspond as to general reading activity . The New York Public Library , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting circulation graph showing that more reading is done during periods of depression than during periods of high employment . Newspaper readers throughout the nation were informed by the Secretary of Labor that employment had never been so high in American history as it was by July 1 , 1952 . The New York Library graph should have shown a drop here but the , curve kept climbing . Fourteen months later ( October , 11953 ) we had an even higher employment figure ( we also had a new Secretary of Labor ) , and again the curve should have gone down . But it did not . The reading curve has been going up steadily since 1945 . These two trends and statements come from large cities and they denote a generally healthy state in regard to the circulation of books for those areas . In regard to the sale of books ( of desperate interest to publishers , retailers , and authors ) , it is a bit harder  | to get a clear story that comes from known forces . Some of the influences are subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole represents a complex of many factors . The actual effect of television on the sale of books ca n't be determined , and we have , in this portion of the discussion at least , something like a repeat on the Baseball vs . TV argument . Blame and responsibility spread out in many directions ( if these things should indeed be assigned to blame or responsibility ) . After the annual Book Fait in New York City in 1953 , at which the question of sales was one of the major subjects , television ? not knowing then ( and not knowing now either ) its place in books and reading ? was not indicted by the publishers . Here is a short quote from the New York Times that summarizes the publishers ' feelings on this point at that time : " Leading book publishers were virtually of one mind in noting that the decline in sales could not be pinned on television , which they regarded as a relatively insignificant factor . " The representative of Doubleday &; Company , Lebaron Barker , stated that TV 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bennett Cerf , head of Random House , said : " Television can be only a help to good books . " Other factors which affect the sale of books came out at this time . The increased cost of living was mentioned . The increased cost of manufacturing books , and of distributing them , was mentioned many times . The limitation of shelf-space in metropolitan apartment houses was noted in the discussions . Hard-covers versus paper editions , and pocket-size books , came in for much notice ? a development in the trade that is truly gigantic already . Other items bearing on the sale of books included not only the 250 and 350 and 500 reprints , but magazines that carry book digests in their back pages , book clubs that give you book bargains . Many things besides television are affecting the sale of books . In November , 1953 , on one of the " Excursion " programs , Raymond Massey , Helen Hayes , and Burgess Meredith all read a story aloud . This was a real , a deep delight . This kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEA conducted a national survey , regarding the national trend in reading ? as it is influenced by television , favorably or badly ? and came to these five main conclusions :  | 1 . Although the number of library card-holders may not be going up , book withdrawals are very definitely on the increase in most public libraries . 2 . Retail sales of books are on the upgrade , too . But retail booksellers say that much of this is due to the paperbound books . 3 . Sales and withdrawals of fiction are down , but the nonfiction field is booming . 4 . Any mention of a book on television is almost automatically followed by a demand for the book in libraries and book stores . 5 . Similarly , any TV program dealing with a controversial subject or any subject in any way provocative brings about an immediate demand for books on that subject . The above conclusions were assembled by Richard Kleiner , NEA staff writer , for the issue of October 31 , 1953 in the World'Telegram and Sun Saturday Magazine . They pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us turn for a few moments to the question of newspaper and magazine circulation . What has TV done to that ? In Charles Sievert 's column , " Lines e Linage , " a recent heading read as follows : IS TELEVISION MEDIA 'S BIG BAD BOY ? IT ACTUALLY SPURS NEWSPAPER READING . Puck , the comic weekly , spent a large sum of money ( $35,000 ) on a study in 1951 to find out what media television was punishing and how bad the damage was . What was TV doing to , say , newspaper reading ? The men who conducted this study were a couple of New York University professors , Harvey Zorbaugh and Wright Mills . They reasoned that if there was damage , there would be more of it in New York since there were more TV sets in New York , per capita , than elsewhere in the nation . The sense of this and its simplicity were reassuring to all the advertising people who knew of the study . Professors as a group , when peering into the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated targets by a couple of million miles . They have managed to insert a statistic where the human eye ought to go . Most professors , especially when working the cities , do n't want to believe anything unless it shows up on a graph or there is a litmus reaction . The professors from NYU were different . They wanted to find out what was happening to newspaper-reading and magazine- reading in homes where there was also TV . They confined their search to homes where this was going on . Many expected it would show television to be such a serious monopolizer of America 's leisure time that the embryo of a new habit-pattern would be discernible at the first reading . Everybody thought television , at the very least , would be some sort of slavering bum . Many even hoped so , some from fear , others because it might provide alibis or explanations for advertising adventures that failed . Or for lading circulation figures . After two years of quiet investigation the results were published . What did they show ? They showed three things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home ; that the reading of Sunday papers increased in homes where there was television ; and that the reading of magazines increased in homes where there was television . This increase was not pronounced , not dramatic . But it was positive , it was consistent , and it was definitely measurable , for they measured it . The percentage " usually reading a daily paper " went from 86 to 90 when television entered the home . In homes " regularly reading one or more magazines , " it went from 52 to 54 . Harold S. Barnes , director , Bureau of Advertising , ANPA 2 shed light on this question when he found , and reported , that in addition to more newspaper reading in TV homes , more women than ever before were reading sports pages because of new interests they 'd found through television and come to enjoy . No one expected the findings to come out just the way they did . No one has yet explained it . At least not quite . The probability is that TV is a general exciter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many different levels . The probability is that television awakens curiosities and responses hitherto dormant , or misplaced , or forgotten . And it may be , too , that television can make any concept or any sum of human feeling more comprehensible , more important , more sharply and simply margined ? and more enjoyable , too ? than would be possible through the ear alone . The eye multiplies our understanding , and refines it . It telegraphs the other senses . For the eye quickens the mind in all its associated reaches , and television in the home is bringing , second by second , the clarity of visual illustration to its own  | spoken comment , the gesture along with the inflection of the word , the revealing chart alongside the stack of figures . For example , television is taking the terror out of the classics by simplifying their language and plot , and by setting in motion the words and their speakers . Television is showing you where Korea is and showing you far more memorably than the books ever showed you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart by letting you look at the flow . Television 's power is direct , pervasive , and lingering . It has this authority over both the expansive and the confined because it is at once universally and minutely articulate . And if it addresses all of its audience at once , it does not seem to be doing so to the individuals of this audience . These it isolates , and speaks to one by one . So it may be that television is urging its viewers ? many of them ? to want to know more , to want to experience more ; and , quantitatively , it may be that the mental and emotional invigorations suddenly summoned by television to the surface of the mind and the feelings , can and do spread out into other channels , and there persuade the human mechanism to new activities , to exercises not before stirred by any other citable stimulus in the routine of daily living . I believe I understand this . If I do , it can be made understandable to anyone by the familiar illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unlighted candles and that thus transfers its own brightness without loss of power to itself while increasing its benefit many times by renewing it in of hers . A more pointed example , at least for all those who loved the book , was the long unfaltering climb of Rachel Carson 's natural history book , The Sea Around Us , to the top of the non-fiction best-seller list , and its long and gratifying occupancy of that spot . It is a remarkable and beautiful book , curiously dramatic and emotional , crammed with surprise . One is in the presence of a writer so honest and so human , an inquirer so spacious and widecircling in interest that the book could have gone on for twice its length . And that is just what happened . Interest in this book was so aggressive in the very way it grasped the mind , that it uncovered  | her first book , Under the Sea Wind ? a title ten years old and a publishing failure ? and put this older , little-known book on the best-seller list , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television is doing . And research finding . This might be the point that was missed by the professors who did the study for Puck . They were astonished when they found that television was improving newspaper and magazine readership , not hurting it . They expected no such thing . They expected television would knock readership on the head . But their research was honest and they had to believe what the meter said . One of them ( C. Wright Mills ) , in a burst of candor rare in the brotherhood , may have immortalized the whole happy significance ( or insignificance ) of his own findings : " I wish it had n't happened . " Surely it 's an amusing irony when a magazine with the national renown of Puck spends $35,000 to apprehend and bind the new town bully , only to find that he 's a she , and that she 's rich , comely , and most of all , pliant . Perhaps she 's versatile enough to be a friend to all . It could be so . As to newspaper circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Periodicals recently published some figures that ought to take TV off the hook on this score too . This Directory is the oldest-established permanent floating annual of its kind in America . The work is assembled and the computation made by the most venerable advertising house in the business , N. W. Ayer &; Son . In its eighty-fourth annual report , the Directory contained this sentence : " Since the end of World War II , evening newspapers added i 2 per cent to their circulations , morning papers 15 per cent , and Sunday papers 19 per cent . " Even the purists should acknowledge that this covers all the years of the black plague of TV in its initial spray of cultural and commercial contagion . There are many indications , some of them strong enough to be accepted as proof insofar as such a thing is possible in such a discussion , that television and reading are good friends , for both children and adults , and not enemies at all . There is most certainly a good deal of suggestion that this is so . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , Charles Poore of the New York Times certainly feels that  | the world he lives in , the world of books , is filled with energy and activity . In looking back over the crop of books for the year of 1952-53 and in giving us a midsummer summary , he opens with these sentences : " All kinds of signs and portents are appearing in the literary sky these days . Never in my memory have so many books made so much news . The reading habits of America are being tested and shaken . In the long run this may be good for us all . Meantime , looking at the lit'ry landscape of 1953 at the mid-year mark , the general view is decidedly full of dynamic elements . " 3 Later on , commenting on the " revolution " in our reading habits that cheap reprints and paper-backed pocket-size books is causing , he says : " Personally , I believe that whatever increases the reading of books is good for the world of books . " He mentions , too , the unusual experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned by Life , as you will remember , and appeared in an " edition " as it were , of 5,000,000 copies . Hemingway 's The Old Man and the Sea also appeared in its entirety in Life , before it was sold as a book . Poore writes : " ... contrary to the notions of gloomy prophets , Hemingway 's story did well in the bookshops after its magazine publication , and that may be one more omen to keep in mind when looking at this year 's peaks and valleys in the world of books . " In relation to this same general problem , the motion-picture people have for a number of years despised and feared television , yet here again ( and still with television to one side ) there is a strong suggestion that a good motion-picture production can create its own kind of stimulation , exactly as many are increasingly feeling that television is doing , by extending excitement and tiriosity , not exhausting them . Perhaps it would result in a healthy dissipation of a lot of pressure if all the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radio , and television ? stopped Swing so suspicious of each other ; stopped being so jealous of each other 's materials and so stingy , each with his own . The case of the no el Kings Row is interesting . We have seen that the magazine publication of a book does not necessarily keep the book from becoming a best-seller as a book . In the cases of Michener and Hemingway , it seems rather to assure this . The fact  | that there are , right now , 175,000,000 ( think of it ! ) paper-bound reprints on shelves looks more like the reverse of a struggle-to-thedeath . In fact , their self-regenerative force is unbelievable . Look at the titles that have been brought back to life and back to favor . Kings Row , because of its motion-picture hook-up , is a good one to point to the next time the old argument comes up . This novel came out , if my memory is right , in 1941 . It was not a failure but it did little better than " get back its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was bought by Hollywood and given a fine screen production , in fact a great production . It was a great hit . It made about four million dollars . What happened to the book ? It was reprinted , and in the next ten months it became one of the ten greatest best-sellers in the history of American publishing . A fine motion picture gave an obscure book such a public fillip that the normal sequences were here reversed . The picture turned the book into a best-seller . Usually the picture people wait till current fiction finds its own way to the top , then buy values already attained . Of more recent date is Lloyd C. Douglas ' novel The Robe . Here the picture surely has n't hurt the book sales , for by January 17 , 1954 this book had been on the best-seller list for 172 weeks in a row . And the picture ? A runaway smash . The dynamism of Kings Row was still so strong that as late as 1951 we reassembled the characters and put this story back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it had the fastest growth record of any new daytime show that year . It was killed by " budget , " our most tireless axman , but could go back on the air tomorrow and do a job for ten years . Wellbourn Kelley wrote the show , a gifted workman . The NEA Service survey , conducted during the summer of 1953 , brings assurance from many places that television is a pretty good house guest . " Interest in television will tend to keep the family at home and any strong influence in that direction , in our opinion , is more likely to help than hinder the reading of books . " This is  | the belief of Harry Scherman , head of Book-of-the-Month , Inc. , and very much the same view as Bennet Cerf 's , noted earlier . Lebaron Barker of Doubleday also subscribes to this . From stores and libraries around the country , this survey found very little fear of and almost no hostility toward TV . Look at these cities and their comment : L. Quincy Mumford , formerly Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV is tending to become an ally rather than a competitor . People want to know more about what they hear and see . Circulation is up over pre-TV years . " Jean Brewer , of a Washington , D. C. Brentano store : " Our switchboard lights up if Dave Garroway mentions a book , with callers wanting to know if the book is stocked . TV has a very stimulating effect on book sales . " Harry N. Peterson , quoted earlier , calls it " purposeful reading . " Clara Ford , who is head of the children 's department in Korner &; Wood , Cleveland 's oldest bookstore , has found that NBC-TV 's " Ding Dong School " is a tremendous help to the sale of children 's books . Ruth Rutzen , head of the home reading service of the Detroit Public Library , told the American Library Association at its convention in Los Angeles in June , 1953 that the nation 's reading habits are always influenced by mass information media but she is in no way fearful of television . " When TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the novelty wore off , people began returning to the library to ask for books on subjects brought to their attention on the TV screens . " John Mackenzie Cory , who is Chief of the Circulation Department of the New York Public Library says : " Our circulation has been on the increase steadily since 1945 . " Robert E. Banker , who is assistant general manager of the Doubleday Book Shops , is of the same opinion we hear from Paul Witty , the reading expert and TV enthusiast in Evanston . Banker Kays : " Once reading habits are established , we do not believe that another form of entertainment , such as television , can destroy t hem . " Dr. Paul Reed of Rochester ( Reed is special consultant for visual and radio education with the Rochester Board of Education ) feels educators can be too quick to criticize television and he  | put some intelligent cautions before them at a conference in the fall of 1953 in New York City . To the Educational Records Bureau and the American Council on Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in our educational program that take into consideration the fact that today 's children and youth come into our classrooms with an accumulation of vivid television experiences that no other generation of young people has ever had . " Oh , yes , it 's true that a few attempts have been made to measure effects , but these have been comparatively shallow and superficial . They attempted to show that because children stay up late they come to school sleepy and thus get lower school grades . They attempt to argue that children who 'd spend time watching television are n't spending time reading books . " No one , as far as I know , has explored the possibility ? and it is a very real possibility , I believe ? that television even as it is today may be causing more reading than ever before , and better reading . Television is providing a tremendous and continuous impact of concrete visual imagery combined with verbal symbolism . " It would be hard to quibble here , at least over the fairness from any educator 's point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that he is the kind of man who could do a great service to the Rochester community by urging his own idea , as here expressed , upon the Board . I am sure he has hit upon one of those sensitive areas where some honest exploring will unlock and release a number of cabined fears and prejudices . Dr. Reed would seem to have the prestige and courage to start this . There is reason to believe , if television is not persuading people to go to their libraries through the bland enticements of improvement , actual force is having an effect . Here is a surprising headline from an Elizabeth ( New Jersey ) newspaper for November io , 1q53 : TV SETS IN HOMES DRIVE STUDENTS TO THE LIBRARY . ( ! ) In my own modest judgment , Dr. Reed 's statement to the conference of educators in New York City has implications and uses that go beyond what he may himself have suspected or intended at the time he spoke . In any case , his brand of thinking , his true  | desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the most critical sites on this whole plane of television and educational engagement . The " critical site " is that area where the educator , in seeking to effectuate his purposes , deliberately spurns the commercial tricks of television just because they are commercial . The educators , from habit , hostility , or prejudice , seem to spurn them only for that reason . Too often they lose a great value here : the value of simple assists to successful achievement . Educators dislike the word " gimmick " ( it is a poor word too , is n't it ? ) , but what is missed in these disinfecting eschewals and avoidances is a great assembly of commercial techniques that any man can use or imitate ? and that became commercial only because they work . While still on the subject of reading and television , I wish to encourage educators to steal our stuff ? all of it that is simple and basic ? that their own studios can accommodate . And there is an example where this application of known commercial techniques is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who decided to try it . This person is Gloria Chandler and her show is " Telaventure Tales " ( KING-TV , Seattle ) . Though this mention of a juvenile show might more properly belong in the next chapter , the idea applies here . Miss Chandler has found , as the producer of the show , that what happens to the reading done by her viewers can be materially influenced by what she wants to have happen to it . Most of her production structure is shrewdly commercial in all its artifices , uses , and intentions . Her main idea is simple : Reading is fun . The purpose of the series is to encourage children to take books out of the library and read them . Miss Chandler reads aloud to a group of about twenty . The backdrop is painted to resemble an open book . As she reads , a comic character , Penjamin Scribble , brings lightly animated assistance to the story 's illusion . Short scenes are acted out ; some of them by characters dressed up and rehearsed . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story-telling . The youngsters , in other words , get into the act ; true audienceparticipation . As to the viewing audience , it is invited to write in , giving its guess as to the identity of characters dramatized . It is  | also invited to say why it liked this or that book ( not " if , " but " why " ) . Briefly , what Miss Chandler has done is to appropriate several of the best-known and most effective technical instruments in the whole system of commercial come-on : Identification of viewer with program Identification of viewer with sponsor ( books , in this case ) Identification of viewer with brand ( in this case specific title of a published book ) Proxy participation of viewer in group enjoyment Direct recognition of viewer ( he is asked to write in ) Direct action required of viewer ( " I like HEIDI because . . . " ) Direct reward to viewer ( picture of Penjamin Scribble ) What is this really ? Just the old box-top pitch . ( " Send loft and box top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Benny Because . . . " ) The psychological and structural stratagems resorted to ( descended to , if you prefer ) that sell drugstore items , candy bars , and cars will sell the educators ' enthusiasms and their high- , lowand medium-grade culture just as surely . Did the thing work for Miss Chandler in Seattle ? Here 's what she says : " The immediate results were remarkable . By the second program the Seattle Public Library and all its branches had reported that every book by the author featured on the first show had been borrowed . The program 's influence extended into rural areas . The King County Public Library 's report indicated that all the books by all the authors mentioned on this program disappeared from the shelves of its 38 branches . And two book-mobiles . " There is one more production note : Gloria Chandler is attractive to look at and to listen to . She 's " telegenic . " As to this item , do n't pass it over lightly in considering the building of something similar in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays off . It 's commercial . Perhaps the most direct vindication that TV has yet received on the reading score appeared as recently as May 29 , 1954 , in a feature article by staff writer Richard Richter in the New York World-Telegram and Sun . The piece dealt with library reading  | and circulation figures in the Brooklyn Public Library since the advent of television ( 1945 ) , and says , in part : " Reading is challenging the Dodgers for a place in the affections of the multitudes . And the challenge is not wild-eyed and fanciful . It leans to cold , hard-headed non-fiction and not to soupy fiction . " It is not confined to one age group . The library steps are ventured in increasing proportions by the very young ( under 12 ) and the older-than-most ( 6o and over . ) " But the most crushing blow to the pessimists who feel humanity is on the road to illiteracy is this : These gains have come in the age of television ? in the years when Howdy Doody trod the boards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John shook his head in dazed bewilderment when asked about the TV effect on book reading . " He turned his swivel chair to gaze fondly at the maze of TV antennas on houses across the street from the main library at Grand Army Plaza . " It 's amazing , ' he said , television stimulates reading rather than replaces it . I was apprehensive at first . I thought it would play havoc with our juvenile readers who come mostly after school . I was afraid shows like Howdy Doody and other afternoon kiddie shows would keep them out of the library . But they adjusted their hours , coming earlier , taking more books out and still being able to rush home in time to see their favorite programs . ' " TV has also made people more aware of the issues of the day , according to Mr. St. John . He said they always had followed the headlines in newspapers ' but now headlines are being brought into t lie living room by TV . " What 's Brooklyn 's reading growth since television ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 8,000,000 were circulated last year , an increase of 85% since 1945 . " Another most interesting , and at the same time about the most responsible analysis of reading habits ? " before and after television " ? that I have thus far seen is the work of the famed Gesell Institute . Because it is brief and because it summarizes so much of the belief that is entertained by the television industry , I have asked for permission to include it in this chapter .  | This is the story that appears under the heading : TV RARELY // " ' HOW CAN I keep television from interfering with my son 's reading ? ' asks the mother of a teenager . " ' To what extent does it actually interfere ? ' we inquire . " ' Oh , terribly . He only reads one book a month since we got television , ' is this mother 's reply . " ' How much did he read before ? ' we asked her . " She looked thoughtful , and then surprised . But she answered truthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Television can interfere with reading , of course . Anything can interfere with most anything . However , our experience has been that a reading ' habit ' which can seriously be interfered with by TV is not a very firmly ingrained habit . " Certainly a new television set in any home can temporarily change recreation and even work habits . But , in most homes , most children very quickly settle back into their own preferred behaviors , and TV takes its place as one of many sources of entertainment and information . " MANY TEENAGE boys and girls do indeed watch TV during a large part of their spare time , and do not read . True enough . Our belief is that most of these same children , without TV , would still not be avid readers . ( Or , if they read at all , would be mainly comic book readers , which in many people 's opinion does not count . ) " A recent analysis of reading habits of teenagers studied by us reveals a really tremendous range in individual reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gathered in the old days before watching TV had become a national pastime . The variety of reading habits reported was about the same before and after TV . " At one end of the scale is the boy or girl who ' hates to read ? never looks at a book ? does n't even read a book a month . ' At the other , the boy or girl who ' loves to read ? nose always in a book ? best thing I do ? my absolute favorite occupation ? a book a day . ' " That ' book a month ' boy is not going to become an ardent reader just because you take television ( or anything else ) away . pI41 The really avid reader very , very seldom gives up books for television . " If you parents do feel that in your particular child 's case TV is interfering with reading or other things , you can always restrict TV viewing to one hour ( or whatever amount of time you choose ) a day or , better yet , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not say you are doing it in order that your son or daughter will have more time to read . This will scarcely make books more popular . Do not confuse the true issues . Treat each one on its own merit . "  | PAUL WITTY , BECAUSE HE CAN PLAY SO WELL IN SO MANY DIFFERENT keys , has brought to education and television an objectivity that is always refreshing , sometimes inspiring . His studies of radio and television listening and looking , and particularly his regular study of television in the suburban Chicago area , are already becoming an important part of the permanent research technique for television , primarily as it relates to television 's impact upon the family as a unit . He finds , and quietly urges upon us that , far more than has hitherto been supposed , television is a true family enjoyment ? the children and their parents " liking most " ( or hating most ) many of the same programs . This fact sharpens the parents ' responsibility in many ways , because it places the parent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine opportunity to observe the child ( or children ) . Parents get better acquainted with their own family . From an alarmed parent , Professor Witty received the following : " The sad truth is that we have raised a generation of people who are so unresourceful that they welcome television to relieve their boredom . Now we are raising another generation that is going to be one step further . What will happen to our national vitality ? " pI43 Quotes like this are common enough ( and altogether meaningless because they are so palpably insincere ) , but it was this kind of recurring " pique " ? and the possibility that there might really be some interesting data if one were to take the time to dig for them ? that initiated his studies . His annual report ( on about 1,400 children , parents , and teachers ) increases in significance all the time . He first found ( 1950 ) that parents and their children were n't looking at many of the same shows . Here 's what Witty found , in hours spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's list of favorite TV programs , seventh and eighth grade children in the left hand column , and the favorites of the parents in the right : figure Only four shows ? Godfrey , Waring , Berle , and Shows of Shows ? enjoyed shared viewing in these early days . This improves as time , asses . Since he has been making annual comparisons , with his findings In this study , Paul Witty found that teacher ownership of TV sets was only 26 percent , as against 68 percent ownership for parents in the same area .  | drawn from the same area , he can look back and come up with a reflection as interesting as this : " Television this year does not seem to be as controversial an issue as it was in 1950 . Ownership figures have increased and with this the resistance to TV seems to have decreased somewhat . It seems that TV is being assimilated into family living ; a somewhat larger number of parents are accepting TV without question and are providing counsel and guidance for their children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witty 's 1951 findings for program popularity of seventh and eighth graders , and their parents : Children Parents figure Children and parents are having more fun together . In the two columns above ( and I now find this repeated in studies from all over the United States ) the children are having a good time with their parents , at the same time , and with the same show , in a ratio of about 8 to 1o . This applies , of course , to programs delivered in the neighborhood of the dinner hour and for the two hours thereafter , and programs offered on weekends . The variable is the enjoyment-factor , but this is hardly important when we consider that we are only talking about the top ten favorites . Obviously all of them are richly enjoyed . And just ' as obviously , the uniting influence of television ? getting the American family together in the same room , getting it happily together ? is a new experience in living and should be noted as ) such . . pI45 Looking back in 1952 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers has doubled ( from 26 percent to a little over 50 percent ) . This doubling of set ownership has cut down teacher criticism . He also records an anomaly ( more amusing than perplexing ) when he ventures into the territory of " most unpopular shows . " 3 Here are ? as Professor Witty found them ? the five Most Disliked TV Programs for 1952 : figure The anomaly ( and it neither frightens nor seriously impresses professional research people ) is that the most popular shows are the ones that most frequently show up on any " most disliked " list . Though Milton Berle continues to be the most popular single entertainer in the country , putting him on the " most disliked " list is a joyous way for myriad interviewers to get square with him , or in one way or another proclaim their position in regard to what they want the world to think of them as cultivated human beings . It is , for example , well known that millions of women watch wrestling on TV ? probably television 's most extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilute its real interest when being directly questioned . Paul Witty 's excursions are always pleasant to read and to study . Ile is not at all afraid of what he finds , has no preconceptions , and is as concerned as all the other investigators as to what effect ' I ' V is having on reading , on family life and scholastic achievement . These extracts from his studies are in this portion of this book for that reason . To summarize Professor Witty 's beliefs , advice , and findings ? as they appear in his most recent published report :  | 2 . Their school work does not seem to be affected . 3 . Their teachers are looking at much more TV too . 4 . Grade school pupils spend an average of more than 22 hours 5 week watching TV ( a i hour increase in 3 years ) . 6 . High school pupils have increased from 14 to 17 hours . 7 . Teachers have increased from g to 12 hours . 8 . Amount of viewing is not related to intelligence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5 were correlated with the hours devoted to TV and the coefficients were insignificant in every grade . There was little correlation between educational test results and amount of viewing . 9 . Parent and teacher attitudes show a change . In 1950 one-half of the teachers associated TV with behavior problems in children . In 1953 , these were reported much less frequently as TV became more and more a regular part of the " life pattern . " 10 . The prediction that the amount of televiewing would drop sharply after the novelty of sets wore off has not been fulfilled . I hope we continue to see Professor Witty 's reports for many years to come . They are very special , and they serve a definite need . In taking leave of him ( in print only ) I wish to quote his two concluding paragraphs from his " Third Report " : " It should be recognized that the problem of TV is related intimately to that found in dealing with other favored activities of children today ? reading comic books , going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the combined problem , teachers should study each child 's leisure pattern and help him cultivate a balanced program of recreation . " Since many parents and teachers fear the adverse effects of TV upon children 's reading , they should recognize that children derive satisfaction almost without effort when they watch TV ? similarly comic books do not penalize them for poor reading habits . In order for children to enjoy the act of reading , they need to have efficient reading habits and skills . The home and the school should cooperate to lead each child to read various kinds of materials with ease and understanding . In order for children to enjoy the results of reading , they need to have experiences in reading which satisfy their interests . Again the role of the teacher and of the parent is important in providing books on different topics and in encourag- ing children to use the library to advantage . They should give children guidance and help in learning to listen , too , and in acquiring discrimination in listening habits . They should also cooperate with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve educational offerings in TV . There is at present a great opportunity and a great challenge in this endeavor. " 4 The reader will have his own opinions about reading and television . I have two children , both girls , one fifteen and one eleven . One is a natural reader , the other a natural non-reader . But the non-reader is now beginning to read without being prompted to do so . She is , truly , finding that it is fun . But she needed help . She did n't know where to look . Four agencies have assisted her there : her parents , her school , the movies , and television . It is possible that one of the items holding back the progress of education via television is that too many are being too pious about the way they look at it . Whenever a group of educators gets together it seems to get so involved with " aims " and the . correct expression of them that nothing gets done . Very little human personality ever emerges from a memo ? nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who wrote it and then never again is seen by any living man or woman . - Bulletin #I6 in the series of 1952 ? Office of Education , the Federal Security Agency 5 ? in endeavoring to set forth some " simple criteria " for educational projects in television , is an example of the kind of thing I am speaking of here . If it met the suggested specifications the program would be pretty sure to fail . It would certainly deserve to . Here are the questions : 1 . Does the program possess anything of permanent value ? 2 . Is the program a part of the recorded life of our nation ? 3 . Does it set a good example ? .1 . Will the action portrayed give good motivation to better citizenship ? Family life ? Choice of companions ? 5 . Does it have any spiritual lift ? 6 . Do you feel better for having spent your time looking at it ?  | Now what is wrong here ? For one thing , there is no hint that the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with human beings . Where he should be interesting he is merely pious . The questions can expect no reply . Nor provoke reaction . Approval by the grandparents of children perhaps , but never approval by the children . Children know when they 're interested and when they 're bored . They do n't need any telling . And just as adults do n't need critics to tell them what they ought to be looking at , so the child ? and the teen-ager ? has no need for sermonizing influences that will supposedly improve the quality of his discrimination . You ca n't point your finger at a child and tell him to be something he is n't . The questions on this list are the negation of living . They have the odor of dead zeal . They have no use . They imply that every show , to be fit for production , should be an essay on manners or morals , or on good government . Too many educators and too many parent-groups seem determined to believe that things would be better if radio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was a Sunday School session and the other half a reading aloud from Ralph Waldo Emerson . Things would not be better then ? they would be dead . These same groups are so insincere in their activities , so remote from present reality , and so incapable of recalling the exuberances of their own youth ? in those cases where they had either exuberance or youth ? that they ca n't believe it is true when Westerns , time after time , turn up as the " most popular " among all television shows . It outrages something " decent " in them . What it does actually is to give them a jolting reminder as to just how far they are from any capacity to participate in the imagination of their children 's generation . This scares them . It separates them . ( It should . ) It leaves them adrift . It turns them in as incompetent to understand their own children by showing them unable to gauge and comprehend their children 's feelings , to measure their children 's standards , to see what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . For this is the child 's world , and if the parents ca n't see the fun of it it 's their loss . In the presence of TV , children can take or leave parents . These same parents , when they finally do realize that Westerns are popular , immediately think they have made this finding first ,  | and they hurry to phones or principals . They never sit down to see what makes the show enjoyable to the child . Nor what it does to him . They ca n't " get " the program with their own child . This is a very harmful situation , full of " insecurity . " I do n't like to criticize anything without also suggesting ways that may lead to improvement . This is assuming that there is substance or objectivity somewhere about . In this connection the kind of questions put to this same type of problem by a group in Cincinnati comes to mind . It was a simple enough study . It is sometimes referred to as the Xavier Study . For a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they wished to be ) than the Federal Office of Education , it was right on the target . The Xavier Study 's objectives were close to the heart of the matter , and here are a couple of its questions : " How do children who have TV sets at home compare with other children in school achievement ? " ( Somewhat the same findings for this as Witty made . ) " Do children having sets at home do better school work when their parents closely control their televiewing ? " These I consider good questions . They are brave and they are simple . They have meaning . They face the problem that has long been suspected to be there ? parent responsibility ; the enriched problem that is really an extension of the same query facing radio when it began seriously to obtrude into the family pattern in the late ' 20 's . Who made up the Xavier Study ? One thousand school children in the 6th and 7th grades of i6 public and parochial schools in the Cincinnati area . The study was conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His purpose ? as well as the sense and sobriety of his conclusions ? commands real respect . The data used involved the child 's mental age , his achievement in school subjects and the actual parental control of the child 's televiewing , as measured by a scale designed by the professor . Besides his own clarity of purpose ( rare in these investigations ) , Professor Clark was assisted by some other healthy forces , among them the Dean of the Graduate School of Xavier University , Dr. Raymond McCoy . The study had the constant assistance of the Bureau of Appraisal Services , and the Cincinnati Public Schools  | and Parochial Schools . The Crosley Broadcasting Corporation provided a " subvention " of funds . Some interesting things came out of this study . In Cincinnati the " scholastic achievement " factor was found to be about what it is in suburban Chicago , where Witty looks at it . " In comparing the achievement of the televiewing children with that of the nonteleviewing children , the study revealed no significant difference . " This was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look at and long remember . Here 's the first : " An appalling percentage of parents have no concern about what their children watch on television . " There were others : " 52% of the children reported they could watch whatever they wished . " " Children tend to watch all the mystery shows or none . " " Bedtime rules for children are changing . Large numbers of children are watching late TV shows . 58% are watching ' Home Theatre ' from 11:o5 to well after midnight , at least once a week . 13% five times a week . " " A surprising number watch TV programs intended for grownups , 22% regularly watching ' Studio One ' ( 10:oo to 11:oo Monday nights ) ; 6% watch boxing till one a.m . " And then , of course , the children who have wiser parents :  --  - " Children whose responses revealed that there was control of elevision in their homes were usually in the higher IQ brackets , and for such there was a pattern of once-a-week programs they " ere allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tough metropolitan neighborhoods , all say that juvenile delinquency is traceable to three causes : poverty , alcohol , narcotics . I believe this . I also believe that juvenile delinquency is traceable to delinquent parents , and that children who are in trouble from too much viewing of TV are normal children in most cases , the victims of delinquency among the preceding generation . Let 's see how some of these misconceptions start . Newspaper headlines can hurt television : AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CALLS TV HORRORS BAD FOR CHILD HEALTH .  | Here 's another : RISE IN RAPE CASES PREDICTED BY MD ? SAYS LURID ' 1'V-RADIO SHOW BUILDS FIRES AS CLINICS BOG DOWN . The first of these is institutional in origin , force , and authorship . " 1'lie second is personal ? a single professional voice speaking with authority . Though both are effective and profoundly sincere , their motives and purposes are not the same . Neither are their journalistic techniques , nor their specific targets . Yet both kinds of criticism ? the group and the individual ? have hurt the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines are good examples of how this starts , who does it , and where it goes . In the first , it is plainly suggested ( and intended to suggest to the newspaper reader ) that TV is injuring the health of American children . In the second , that TV ( and radio ) are kindling fires that are leading to rape . It is only fair to the authors of these stories ( the AMA Journal on the one hand , and Dr. Frederic Wertham on the other ) to state that the following comments are based on what they were quoted ( by the New York papers ) as having said or written . However , that is the way their words reached the public . In fact , in this instance Dr. Wertham did n't write anything ; he was interviewed by reporters , and he ad libbed . The first headline , a better-than-average screamer , can be found ( with localized variations ) in almost any metropolitan newspaper n the country two or three times each month . The story accomanying the headline cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television is sickeningly familiar . Look at it , then ess with what notion the reader is left . TV HORRORS . . . BAD . . . CHILD HEALTH . This as$ iation puts a second-degree skin burn on the industry before the poor reader gets beyond the first paragraph . Following such a headline the whole story could be totally unsupported and televi+iunn would still be hurt . The fact that a medical group is quoted adds something else : it i% es the news piece a suggestion of endorsement it should n't have , nil it gives it something more that is even worse : an inferable rationalism the AMA itself would quickly disclaim if it saw the newspaper version of its own article . At least I think the AMA mold be quick to disclaim it , for we encounter " conclusions "  | drawn from some of the dreamiest nonsense ever seen in print . In order to see what this nonsense is one has to read with conscientious objectiveness . It 's quite fascinating but it 's a real trap , and this is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conclusion " was a survey ascribed by the article to TV Magazine . Right here , it will be seen , a lot of people can hide behind a lot of other people if they need to . This magazine counted the major crime incidents of all the TV shows emanating from all the studios in Los Angeles during the last week of May , 1952 . The count was 852.6 Seventy-five percent of these major crime incidents were on programs for children . Minor acts of violence were n't counted , only the major ones . The minor crimes were more or less discounted , as being merely " innumerable saloon brawls , sluggings , and assaults . " Your guess , then , as to the " majors " is as good as anybody 's , but obviously they must be rougher than brawls , assaults , and sluggings , in order to qualify . No description of what was considered a major crime incident was made , no suggestion as to what it did to the kids who saw these shows was made . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count . I call this nonsense and I call it dreamy . The other source used in the AMA 's story against TV was a survey made by Dr. M. I. Preston . Here 's the Journal 's 7 quote on Dr. Preston 's survey : " Up to the age of 12 , common reactions included retiring to the mother 's bed for comfort and reassurance , screaming , pulling the bed-covers over the head , burying the head under a pillow , or diving under the covers ? there to spend an uneasy night plagued by vivid recollections . " This is the kind of " medical " attack that drives strong silent men to slang . It is not scientific reasoning , based on weighed evidence . It is not professional reporting . It is not even intelligent clinical speculation . It is rumor . As rumor , it has the sort of " alarm-value " that makes mothers gang up on television . They hunt for people to write to . Many of them write to Freda Hennock ( who is about the most energetic  | member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried hard to answer the alarm , and from public platforms and newspaper interviews she has often managed to do so . But the disturbance factor remains because mothers , on reading such distressing reports , almost always accept them . They do n't question . They do n't set up challenges . Yet they have a right and a duty to challenge . Challenges of what sort , it is asked ? Challenges regarding the method of the survey and the credibility of its contents . Look what mothers would have uncovered if they had brought to account any of the facts in the horror story cited above . As to methods , they would have found that no method was disclosed . They would have found that Dr. Preston 's " control group " of children was n't being questioned on what TV was doing to them then , or on what TV had done to them ever . It was a quiz made 12 years before ! And a quiz on what horror movies and radio crime shows were doing to them then . No TV about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all done before the era of television began . A study made in 1940 to put radio and the movies on the pan had been resuscitated in 1952 to make a social monster out of television . This is really quite rotten . None of it , however , imputes an improper motive to the American Medical Association , nor to Dr. Preston ( who would doubtless be embarrassed by the re-application of an old study ) , nor to TV Magazine . But the sum of it , and the aftereffect , is an outrageous calumny , for Dr. Preston 's so-called findings ( they are no such thing ) actually constitute an allegation . He could not recognize the published distortion of his own laboratory effort . Even for radio , though , this study is as suspect as it is typical . Ile used a control group consisting of 153 children . Of these , 76 percent " showed increased nervousness " ( after the radio crimes and horror movies ) , 85 percent " suffered from sleeping disturbances , " 51 percent " were found to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beauty ) , " fears were increased five-fold in 94 percent . " They may call it science if they wish , but here are some of the reasons why it is not science . No answers for any of the following questions on method , procedure , purpose , technique or authority wen provided :  | What was known of the children before they were subjected to any testing ? How did they determine that the " five-fold " was five ? Was there a before-and-after count of the nail-biters ? How bad is nail-biting ? Was all the nervousness of a destructive nature ? Was it assumed that all children had the same reaction pattern ? How long did how many of the children remain disturbed ? To what degree were they disturbed ? How were these complex measurements recorded ? How many dived under the covers and spent the night that way ? Who takes responsibility for this remarkable statistic ? What were the names of the films and radio programs provided for the children ? Was this entertainment originally created for children ? What had these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these particular films and shows selected ? What was the purpose of the survey ? Did each child have a trained technician to evaluate his reac-tions ? Did each technician use the same method of making and evaluating his findings ? What was the method ? What allowance for error was made ? In testing children for entertainment reactions , how much technical experience did Dr. Preston bring to the job ? In what respect is this experience held ? It is presumed that Dr. Preston , from the point of view of clinical interest as well as professional integrity , described his methods adequately . However , an inquiring reader has a right to the answers to the questions just asked . He has a special right if the published findings are going to scare people . He never gets them because they are never given . Because such answers are never given and because " methods " are never described , television loses another round with the public it is trying to serve . It loses just that much more public confidence . Lost ground has to be won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the setback , this hurts . And in time and money and energy , it 's expensive . If the networks or the advertising agencies were as sloppy in their use of the technical instruments of measurement they have developed ( and it is admitted they are far from perfect ) , or if they were as waltz-minded in their application of these instruments , they 'd all be out of business in a month . TV is being clubbed to death by the blunt instrument of rumor , vindictiveness , phony research , and sensation-hunting , and those who practice it are getting away with murder . How ? They never have to back up what they say . The kind of attack just described , whether direct or insinuated , appears in many forms and is extremely common . It is the classic pattern . There will be more of it . Look at it carefully the next time , and see if it is trying to substantiate any of its charges . I n the past almost none of it has . That means that almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television industry , for the television public , and usually it is bad also for the propounders and propagators who wrote the charges or an interpretation of the charges . Here is a more recent example . Many readers will remember it . This one hurt TV briefly , but it may have hurt some meddlesonic " investigators " ( university type ) somewhat more . There is some poetic justice in that Chicago ( where the fogbank of the Monitor Studies was developed ) should be the city where much of the nonsense engendered by this fog was condensed , tested for poison , and finally poured down the sink as harmless . These Monitor Studies 8 created much disturbance on the West ( : coast when their Los Angeles " findings " were widely reprinted in California newspapers . What they found was that actors in Westjfrns carried revolvers and very often shot at other actors . They plan found that crime shows and whodunits had moments in which actors were often hit on the head or on the jaw . They  | found that these experiences were common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a whole week of it . For Los Angeles it was the week of May 23 to 29 , 1951 . The week the professors looked at their own shows in their own city ( Chicago ) was July 3o-August 5 of the same year . The increase in juvenile delinquency in Chicago at that time was ascribed to the bad lessons and the violence that youngsters could see every day in the television that came into their homes . This came to a boil when a subcommittee of the Chicago City Council , after indicting television programs for juvenile delinquency , published the following resolution : " Whereas , more than 2,500 crimes of violence including more than 98o murders were shown during the last year over Chicago 's four television stations ; and " Whereas , there has occurred in the City of Chicago during the past year a shocking increase in teen-age crimes , and " Whereas , there exists a connection between the showing of these crime films and the shocking teen-age crime in Chicago , therefore , be it " Resolved , that the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proposal and take all necessary steps for the correction . " This was a clean show-down and it was cleanly met . The men who operated the four stations in Chicago prepared a statement , showing how they ran the stations and what they exhibited on them. ? They presented no witnesses . Why should they ? The public is their witness . The hearing included civic groups , Parent-Teacher Association representatives , clergymen , law enforcement agencies , and representatives from universities . All these people agreed that censorship was a dangerous thing . The Director of the Chicago Psychiatric Institute and a member of the Chicago Crime Commission stated that it could not be demonstrated that there was any connection between juvenile delinquency and television programs in Chicago . What happened ? The subcommittee voted to dissolve its own investigation ! And this was done . The National Association of Educational Broadcasters has done pI57 a number of useful things , but in endorsing and maintaining the Monitor Studies , it has not only stood on the brink of lunatic use of statistics . It has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know of anything so grievously ill-considered or meaningless ; a sad show from the start . If there is criticism of television that is prompted by honest motive ( and there is surely some ) , there is far too little that is supported by evidence . Television should ignore this , for it is empty . Do television shows give occasional nightmares to children ? Certainly . And to occasional grown-ups too , for that matter . But so does street traffic . And report cards . Television will continue to give many of us a nightmare now and then . So will radio . But Poe and Bierce were pretty good at the same thing , to mention a couple of our boys . And the classics can lick us , show for show , in any century you want to pick . So can the brothers Grimm . My 15-year-old daughter read The Turn of the Screw for the first time last night . It shook her up a lot , and thrilled her thoroughly . That is exactly what Henry James had planned for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It 's only the stalest sort of casuistry that keeps this argument alive . Scaring an audience to death is the first objective of all melodrama , the first duty of its author ? book , story , play , movie , or network thriller . I discussed the radio aspects of much of this in Harpers Magazine over ten years ago . Having the imagination briefly seized and shaken by fear ? fear that is naked and primitive and right-in-the-room ? is not only the goal of all storytellers in this field but one of the few really exhilarating pleasures in living . It is why self-imitative whodunits , while often cheap , are imperishable . We are finding out a little more each day ( or we think that We are ) that behind each juvenile delinquent there is another delinquent by no means juvenile . It may be a person . It may be a whole institution . Or it may be a social attitude . If university professors are afraid to say what they think for fear of being put on blacklists , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed the readers of Look ) , likewise the case of juvenile delinquency is not being met head-on  | by secondary school teachers and principals who have been found so intimidated by dangerous teen-age hoodlums that the principals wo n't even report them to the police . This was reported over and over again during the month of March , in many Eastern cities , including New York and its metropolitan suburbs . Bombs and bomb scares , knifings , shootings , stranglings , rape cases , robberies , and a whole epidemic of vandalism that has left many Atlantic States high schools looking as if the Visigoths had been through them , have put such a fear into local school administrations that series of closed meetings have been called ; meetings that include not only the school principals , but district attorneys , law secretaries of the education boards , justices of Children 's Courts , justices of Adolescents ' Courts , school property supervisors , and detectives . Meantime , parents who have teen-age children going to schools in neighborhoods known to be unsafe ( and I am one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the modern teenage hoodlum is a switchblade knife , any kid can have and carry such a knife . ' ? They have been carrying these knives for many years . I 've seen them . They are all over my own neighborhood . ( In New York City there is no such thing any more as a " good " neighborhood . ) There is so much hypocrisy and so little truth in so much we read about television that no satisfactory rules or limits of debate can be laid down . But I challenge any man or group to present evidence that has both substance and respectability and that urges us to the conclusion that television has ever done damage to a living normal human being of any age , circumstance , or nervous composition . Nobody has ever been able to hang this charge on radio either . And there 's a good reason . There is no such evidence . In the whole frenetic zigzag of TV vs. the Children vs. the Parents , the parents are seldom singled out for censure . They are either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're  | signatories to petitions to stop broadcasting . Or they 're members of the PTA . Or perhaps they 're the very parents of the delinquents . Is n't there indeed such a thing as a delinquent parent ? You may be very sure there is , since we can all name several . With the exception of my wife and myself , almost everybody I know is a delinquent parent . If the truth be really known , when children get in trouble it 's often because their own parents are doing a poor policing job . Why does n't some child " expert " ever admit this ? If there 's trouble , known trouble , about how much and what TV shows are to be looked at , the parents have a responsibility they should recognize and honor and deal with , just as they deal with any other leisure-hour problem , or homework problem , or readingselection or movie-selection problem . Any kid will get into trouble if he is n't supervised , if his habits are n't watched and channeled , his enthusiasms bevelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing ? The need for this is apparent in many separate studies and surveys . One of these comes from the Columbus ( Ohio ) area . I t was headed up by Mrs. Melvin C. Koch , Investigator for the Television Committee for the White House Conference on Children and Youth . In this commendable and objective study ( it was carried out in a " saturated area " ) , some items turned up which one seldom sees in such studies ? rules for watching . I should like to quote directly from her report , and I recommend that parents interested in the same problem write to Mrs. Koch for a copy of this frank and in many ways remarkable study . YOUNG CHILDREN 'S RULES The K-2 children ( that is , kindergarten to second grade ) state that on Amount of Time Watching : 13 must stop watching by a certain time on schooldays ; to must turn TV on or off at a certain time ; 8 are to watch a while at a time ; and I each said  | " do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " only look at 4 programs a day . " On Times of Watching , 42 must be in bed by a certain time ; 14 ca n't watch while eating ; and 1 must be outside until supper . The small children 's Watching Depends Upon sharing with family members , 16 ; doing homework first , 14 ; being good and eating good , 11 ; then with 4 or under , doing home chores first , " work " done first , turning television off when father comes home and " if I go away from TV Mommy will turn it off . " There were many Conditions While Watching stated by 50 children . Do n't get too close to TV written in by 24 ; if fight , it 's turned off , 6 ; do n't play with controls and sit on a seat , 4 each . Then 3 or less , be quiet , keep light on , do n't have TV on too loud , do n't watch in dark ? might hurt eyes , do n't stand in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching , wear my glasses , and stay on a certain chair . For the small group , Content Watched is mainly in two parts : ca n't watch murder-mysteries stated by 16 , and 12 said , " watch the programs they ( parents ) want me to . " Then with 3 or less , watch only children 's programs , watch only 1 cowboy a day , ca n't watch late show , " ca n't choose programs evening , but afternoon I do , " " not too many gun programs , " " ca n't have a gun , " and " person who turns on TV first gets to pick the programs . " RULES FOR INTERMEDIATES For these children , under Amount of Watching , two rules are about equal : stop watching at certain time on school days , 21 ; and turn on or off at a certain time , 20 . Then 9 said , " do n't look at TV too much , " 6 are to watch a while at a time , another said " ca n't watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching rules for these 4-6-8th graders are : foremost , bed by a certain time ( most said on a school day ) , 53 ; 9 ca n't watch while eating ; then individuals stated ca n't watch while parents have company , be outside till supper , no TV before school , and do n't turn TV on ' til after supper . Their Watching Depends Upon first and foremost , having homework done , 72 ; then home chores done , 31 ; for 15 " work done first " ; 11 must share viewing with family members , 6 must  | practice music first , then rest must ask to turn set on and must turn it off when told . Two Conditions While Watching are first : do n't play with the controls , 17 ; do n't get too close to set , 16 ; then with 4 or under : not turn channel while someone is watching , do n't have volume too high , do n't lie down while watching , do n't eat while watching , keep light on , sit still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't watch in the dark , do n't turn light too bright , do n't talk too much , do n't turn channel during an ad , only certain family members can turn channel ; sit on scat ; if fighting , set is turned off ; keep low when someone is sleeping . For Content Watched : no murder-mysteries , 1o ; watch programs " parents want me to , " 10 ; only one cowboy show a day and " only one comedy program after dinner , " " only two westerns a day , " and " ca n't watch Milton Berle . " RULES FOR OLDER STUDENTS On Amount of Watching , the loth-12th graders indicated they must stop watching by a certain time school nights . Times of Watching rules are : bed by a certain time on schooldays ; ca n't watch while eating ; watching depends on homework done , sharing with family , home chores done . On both Conditions While Watching , and Content Watched , older students indicated very little regulation . One could wish , in Mrs. Koch 's section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like wrestling but my parents do , " " My father likes boxing and I do n't , " " When some want to look ut Ed Sullivan and the rest want to look at the Comedy Hour , " etc. ) , that she had brought some answers to this universal dilemma , and we may find st in a later study . Here are her conclusions : " Just what is the Giant 's ( television ) place in family life ? " We find that nearly all Franklin County families have him in their homes . " Children are spending a large part of their free time watching him . They tend to watch a few types of programs while they  | are young , and more types and variety as they grow older . But , they are watching all kinds of programs that respond to a switch of the dial ? whether they be children 's , young people 's , adult or what-you-will types of programs . " While 5 to i8 year-olds watch the variety the Giant offers , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest some other kinds they 'd like . They want this Giant to examine his make-up ? his programs ? and mix in some different ingredients . " While children rate the Giant exceedingly popular in their homes , neither they nor their parents are letting him disrupt their lives entirely . " In fact , children are still playing a great deal , first and foremost after school on weekdays , and are observing religious activity on Sunday . Nearly two-thirds go to church on Sunday . The time the Giant is most popular with them on school days is after supper . " Just as children are playing a healthy amount , and attending church on Sunday , so are they and their parents keeping the home , health , and homework fires burning . They not only keep the routines of life going ; they have numerous rules about them . Certain bedtimes are being insisted on , homework done assuredly , the dishes washed and wiped , sharing of the Giant 's programs attempted , piano lessons practiced , extracurricular activities pursued , the baby sat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often , the Giant is the premium for good behavior and work done . " True , many of these activities are done with the Giant heard and seen in the background . But nevertheless , the Giant is not the controller of the family . He is being controlled . " Both children and parents have some say in what children will watch on the Giant . For it is virtually three-fourths of the children who get to choose their own programs only some of the time . As expected , high school students are most free to choose their own programs . " Are not only parents but also children questioning ? moredisagreeing over what the Giant 's offering them ? Indeed , yes . In nearly half the families . Particularly those whose children are 5 toi3.  | " Over what are they disagreeing ? Content , primarily . Then , time conflict . " What kind of content do they disagree on most ? Murders and mysteries . This first , whether the child be 5 , 9 , 13 , 18 ; i.e. , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeing with Mother and Dad over cowboys and westerns . Their 15 to i8 year old brothers and sisters , for what little disagreement there is , show the second most common dispute over programs of boxing and wrestling . " Yes , the Giant has made a tremendous impact upon the lives of families . Into the majority he has brought the need for new rules and family guidance , and new problems of family-sharing . Into about half , that we know of , he has brought outright conflict . But , of greatest significance , in spite of all the family maneuvers that occur because of the Giant 's presence , the stolid fact remains that families , both children and parents , are trying to control this Giant ? television . " This primary question remains : Is the Giant 's position in the home changing from that of the awesome , overwhelming guest to being a family member , subject to family counsel , criticism , and controls " ? Is the Congress of the United States intelligently concerned about all this ? Yes , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the chairmanship of Senator Robert C. Hendrickson ( R-N.J. ) , is currently investigating juvenile delinquency 12 and there are many signs ( though no reports are as yet published ) that this may be the investigation that will set straight much that was badly divvered in so many of the previous inquiries . ( The assumption , by committee members , that television , or radio , was necessarily on the defending side , demolished any chance for objective search by many sedulous seekers-after-the-truth in previous investigations the attitude of Representative Gathings of Arkansas being pretty typical . ) As these pages are prepared for publication , only the first phase of Senator Hendrickson 's hearings has taken place . This  | phase deals with the extent and the cause of delinquency in the opinion of experts . In testimony of 21 witnesses taken to date , television has received only four mentions , and from the following persons : Professor Sheldon Glueck , Dr. Edward D. Greenwood , John Gutknecht , and Mrs. Lynn Stratton Morris . Professor Glueck , of the Harvard School of Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no scientific measurement as to its impact . It is neither " all good or all bad " ; it depends on how you use it and digest it . Dr. Greenwood , child psychiatrist with the world-famous Menninger Clinic in Topeka , Kansas , said there is no authoritative evidence that television creates any harmful effects on children . " It would be so simple if we could just blame media , " but emphasized that this was a false assumption . John Gutknecht is state 's attorney in Cook County , Illinois . He saw radio and television as " aids to mankind " and said that broadcasting had caused no increase in juvenile delinquency . Mrs. Lynn Stratton Morris was even more forceful . She is the administrative secretary for New York City 's Committee on Use of Narcotics . She said that " lack of television in the home " had been found by the American Sociological Society to be one of the reasons for increased narcotic use . " TV homes seem to keep the children closer to the family and off the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of juvenile delinquency cited the same three basics : alcohol , narcotics , poverty . Senator Hendrickson 's subcommittee will collect data on the extent and nature of juvenile delinquency , adequacy of legal provisions , and social treatment . In speaking before a group of social agencies in Hackensack , New Jersey in December , 1953 , the Senator said : " This subcommittee is very interested in taking a long look at these mass media of communication , and we are going to do so . But for all of this national concern about Television ? and I am concerned enough to want to take an objective look ? is it not just a bit too easy to blame all our troubles on one item " ? Serving as counsel for the Hendrickson subcommittee is Herbert J. Hannock , of Newark , New Jersey . Assisting the group in its work are Fred Delliquardi , Wisconsin Department of Public  | Welfare ; Harold Hagen , American Public Welfare Association ; Harold V. Langlois , Rhode Island Department of Social Welfare ; Douglas McNeil , New Jersey Department of Institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , United States Treasury Department . Many experts already questioned in these hearings agree that numbers alone account for increase in incidence of juvenile delinquency . Population figures for American children ( people under 18 ) will reach 55 ? million by 196o . This is an increase of $1 million in one decade . To be sound , measurement of juvenile delinquency should be on a ratio and not a " total offense " basis . The U. S. News and World Report points out that " all the current furore is being caused by 5.5 per cent of the juveniles . " The most recent news story of the full committee appeared in the New York Times , July 6 , 1954 , and will be found as Appendix IV in this book . No one in television is going to object to any probing into any of its activities , or plans , or results if the probers have real purposes and sensible methods . And an investigation that is truly objective will be as enthusiastically welcome as it is novel . But a lot of fur is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient and philosophical observer ( and minor day-laborer ) that there is ever going to be an end to the imputed blameworthiness of radio and television for most of the big items in the long list of passing peccadillos . There is a whole battery of articulate and powerful men who have wrenched their way into print , or who were already there when television arrived , or who have declared themselves responsible for ridding the nation of the comic magazine ? a battery of men so pre-fixed in their ideas , so non-persuadable in the narrowness of their quest , so mentally blocked off yet so robustly and peripatetically purposeful , that even if the ghost were finally laid , these men would take it off the ash-heap of dead causes and dead ideas and pump it full of oxygen in order to revive the corpse if only for the purpose of sending off another magazine , aisle . I am thinking of men like Dr. Frederic Wertham , who has a new book called Seduction of the Innocent in which he  | " proves " his case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look at ! ) I am thinking of men like Norman Cousins , editor of the Saturday Review who ca n't wait to be the first to get up in the morning to warn the nation about something that just hit him the night before . With Cousins , we can no longer sit down to mature a bit before we 're obsolete . These men ca n't remain calm in their own shower-bath , and some of the spouting and the apopemptic , and most of the nervous caveat , spreads over their sentences like spilled catsup the minute they think about radio and television . ( And both of these men will go on either medium at the drop of an announcer . ) Here is an oft-quoted spasm from Cousins : " Out of the wizardry of the television tube has come such an assault against the human mind , such a mobilized attack on imagination , such an invasion against good taste as no other communications medium has known , not excepting the motion picture itself . " In the one year since television has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of plodding stereotypes and low-quality programs . Behind it all , apparently , is a grinding lack of imagination and originality which has resulted in the standardized television formula for an evening 's entertainment ; a poisoning , a variety show , a wrestling match . All speculation over the future of television must begin with the hard truth that right now it is being murdered in the cradle . " I do not know what kind of insecurity Mr. Cousins suffers from and I do n't care , but I will say that when he finds out one small and humbling truth about the American people ? or any people ? he will be more able to understand the television set that now so appalls him . Here it is : All people have access to television , and television must therefore serve them all , including the people Mr. Cousins does n't know ? the lonely and the poor and the scared , and if Mr. Cousins will pardon the expression , the cheap . In this democracy cheap people have equal television rights with Mr. Cousins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if most Americans hate television as much as Mr. Cousins hates it and wants us to hate it , there is always the  | Saturday Review to take its place . It could use new subscribers , too , I would think . Dr. Wertham is worse than Norman Cousins , because for one thing he 's not only a prominent man but a prominent psychiatrist ; and for another , he 's more of a repeater than Cousins . Wertham never lets up . When he goes after comics , he uses about the same caliber gun and same ammunition he took into the woods for radio and television . " What children get out of comic books is that kindness , sympathy and regard for human suffering are all weaknesses ; that cunning and shrewdness are the kind of thing that counts ; and that women are not to be respected as persons , but are luxury prizes like automobiles , distinguished chiefly by sexy attributes rather than by a high ideal of womanhood . " I have children . They read comic books . This is not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zillion miles . They got fun . That is all . Then they got bored and they quit reading comics . Dr. Wertham does n't want anybody around refuting him , no doubt , but there are psychiatrical opinions at variance with his own ; and one from his profession , but the other sex , being diametrically opposed . It is the view of Dr. Lauretta Bender that aggressiveness is normal in children and that , except in rare cases , all this violence on television , in comic books , and the movies , provides only a harmless outlet for this aggression . Dr. Paul Witty of Northwestern , who has been mentioned several times elsewhere in this book , has uncovered an expert on this matter of crime and violence as a daily dish for typical Amerit an children . I have never seen a soberer or more adult summary on anything . It is the view of David Pace Wigransky whom Dr. Witty encountered during the latter 's inexhaustible investigations of t lie leisure-hour doings of young folks around Evanston , Illinois . I ) r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child looks upon crime and violence as ideal adventure and excitement . He has no desire to experience these things in actual form , and knows them only as fun and not in their true ugliness . ' I he adult , on the other hand , has had actual experiences along this line and looks upon fighting and violent action as loathsome and horrid . "  | Mr. Wigransky is fourteen years old . Professor Witty after several years of independent research is undismayed . " Parental disapproval of television stems from a feeling that programs are too violent , too sensational , too stimulating , and include too many westerns . A surprising number of persons who do not yet own TV sets look upon television with something very close to terror . " Miss Freda Hennock of the FCC , also much quoted , has some practical challenges , and education 's responsibility thereto : " We need programs which will emphasize our great cultural heritage ; we need programs which will effectively prepare and assist our people to assume the responsibilities of citizenship in a great democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest an integral part of radio and television . And it is on the educators that I lay the principal burden for doing this . " Another way to do it is to urge the educators to become interesting enough to win audiences . Television gets too much criticism that does n't mean anything , and gets hurt because a lot of this meaningless criticism gets into the papers . Mrs. Clara S. Logan , about whom I know nothing except what is printed about her and her propaedeutical desires in the nation 's press ( Mrs. Logan was , at the time quoted , the president of the Southern California Association for Better Radio and Television ) asked the Los Angeles radio and TV stations ( in 1949 ) to stop what they were doing and substitute " acceptable programs which would be suitable for family viewing and listening . " Los Angeles program producers assumed they were already doing not only pretty much that , but exactly that , and did not answer her suggestion , except for station KNBH which acknowledged her letter but told her that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the very things she disliked and thereby create further interest in them . " This is a brand of elliptical thinking new to me ( and I would guess new to Mrs. Logan ) because Time carried some of this story , and Wayne Coy , the FCC 's chairman at that time was informed by the Southern California Association that " none of the stations was willing to talk over the survey . " The survey contained the information that for a single week in the Los Angeles area , between six and nine  | P.M. , the following violences occurred on television : 91 murders , 7 stage holdups , 3 kidnapings , ro thefts , 4 burglaries , 2 cases of arson , 2 jailbreaks , i murder by explosion , 2 suicides , i blackmail case . The reason Mrs. Logan 's survey did not interest the program builders of the stations to whom she sent her report was because the stations , having built the programs , knew what was in them . They were the stations that put them on the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paid for them . No one should be surprised when they tell television stations what is in the programs that the television stations are producing , and then do n't hear from the stations . What else could they say but " Yes , Mrs. Logan " ? For that matter , if they did answer her with a view to being helped in solving a program problem , they would start right where she leaves off : with a definition of her own phrase " acceptable programs , " and a definition for " suitable for family viewing . " Does she know what she means by this ? Maybe , but " she do n't say . " All the shooting and rough-riding and fist-fighting in all the westerns and kid shows in the whole history of television never hurt a flea . Ask Mr. Wigransky . And on the general subject of leisure time , it might not receive sociological sanction to suggest that what our forefathers did with their leisure time when they were themselves youngsters was to waste it whenever they could ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the general store , they heard very little that was important , improving , or culturally provocative . But it would be closer to the truth . Networks are sending programs of every kind all day and most of the night into 30,000,000 American homes , but once it 's in your home it 's your show and yours only . You 've got to steer it from there . We 'll make the rain ? as it were ? but you 've got to dig your own irrigation ditches and regulate the flow according to the precise needs and desires of your own acreage . You are the only person who knows what they are . Delinquent parents used to blame radio for their problem children . Now they blame TV . In another year or two they will he able to blame three-dimensional stereoscopic ortho-antiseptic color-TV , and as soon as philosophers can tie the fourth dimension to production formulae , they will be blaming their children 's  | derelictions on that one . It is always somebody else who 's delinquent . Who was responsible , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxicating drinks to minors throughout New York State in 1953 ? The State Liquor Authority disciplined 358 holders of liquor licenses for selling hard liquor to teen-agers . Who was to blame here ? The police ? It seems hard to blame them , for it was the police who reported these violations . The bar and grill owners ? Yes , to some extent . But they do n't want the trade of youngsters , nor the nuisance of youngsters . The appearance of teen-agers at bars is the worst sort of advertisement for the saloon business . Who else then ? Teen-age drinking in bars is primarily the fault of the parents . It is an even split between two groups of parents , those who do n't know that their children are drinking in bars , and those who do know because they are at the bars with them , where the grown-ups " capitulate shamefully to the demands of their offspring to buy drinks . " Aside from the fact that sales to minors reached an all-time high in 1953 , it is significant that licensee alertness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spurious documents increased . What about the economic aspects of some of this ? For example , are too many of America 's mothers " working mothers " ? This was an opinion arrived at in New Orleans in the spring of 1954 when the National Catholic Family Life Conference held its annual meeting there . Their concern led to a resolution which , while acknowledging that working women had made tremendous contributions to the wealth of America , concluded with this fear : " The price in the shape of moral and spiritual ruin is much too high . " The resolution cited the untold millions of ( working ) mothers as " actually helping in the destruction of the very homes they seek to serve . " The " desertion " factor was pointed to as contributing directly to the increase in juvenile delinquency . In an eye-opening article on this subject in the Saturday Evening  | Post , March 27 , 1954 , Dr. Marjorie Rittwagen , a psychiatrist at Manhattan Children 's Court , mentions parental neglect time after time . Some of the cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read , but Dr. Rittwagen reports almost the whole sordid story with the proper professional restraint ; that is , until the one great truth of this twilight world forces her to use italics . " It 's the parents who are delinquent ! Why does n't the judge punish them " ? She recounts the lurid story of " Bobby , " aged ten , who trussed up his eight-year-old friend , then killed him with a shotgun blast , and she asks , " Was Bobby just a scrappy kid who read too many comic books ? Or watched too many TV shows ? . . . It did n't take us long to determine one thing : the killing had been no accident . . . . He was an emotionally sick boy ? an incipient schizophrenic . " I read this article , as I had read many others , to see if there was concrete evidence or reasonable suspicion that television is fostering delinquency . I could n't find any . And I would report any I could find . This is the only mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sentences , all of them saddening or terrifying , come leaping up at the reader from the startling disclosures she makes : " The difficulty of getting the proper treatment for a child is the most frustrating part of probation work . " Last year many different types of treatment were recommended for 9500 neglected and delinquent children under sixteen at Manhattan 's Children 's Court . The majority were adjudged delinquent . . . . At the other extreme were children brought in by their parents as incorrigible who turned out to be perfectly normal youngsters healthily rebelling against impossible homes . " When Bud was eight , his father had strung him up by the feet from a steam pipe for two hours . Bud suffered third-degree burns and had to be hospitalized . When Bud was nine , Mr. Sotman ( Bud 's father ) broke his arm ; held it across his knee and snapped it . " Parents like Harry Sotman are not uncommon in any children 's court . Neither are unmarried mothers who have eight children  | by as many men , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we punish them ? " Some we commit . . . and we would commit many more if the institutions were n't already overtaxed . " Then there is a much larger group of parents . . . who had such miserable love-starved childhoods themselves that they are totally unable to give their children any affection . They are the neglected children of yesteryear grown up . " Television is trying to deceive no one , certainly not itself . And I doubt , too , if it is being very much deceived . It has made many mistakes ? a couple that have been real beauties ? but most of them are caught and caught quickly . And those in television who are sensitive to outside criticism know at once when the criticism is real and when it is false . In this field , televison knows who is delinquent . Who is looking , and what is happening to those who are looking ? that is television 's number one concern . In the playback quiz that was put together by Dr. Preston , which we examined earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children tend to become excited when exposed to excitement . That was known before . Before radio , and before Dr. Preston too . What can be learned from Dr. Wertham , also mentioned , is a little harder to judge . Dr. Rittwagen ( though her subject was juvenile delinquency and not television ) found and reported some of the basic and shocking causes of delinquency in New York . If she had found TV a culprit we expect she would have said so . Dr. Wertham , who also studies this same subject in the same city , puts a great burden of blame on television , and radio , movies , and comics . Does he prove anything ? Does he get close ? He makes a good point with comics but with TV he is quite vapid . Yet this man enjoys unbelievable publicity . Naturally television is going to deny that it starts crime waves . And it is going to deny that it accelerates metropolitan rape rates . It seems absurd that it has to be put in the position of denying such , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reporters from the New York World-Telegram and  | Sun and asked for his professional opinion as to why there were so many sex attacks going on in New York , he voiced an opinion that produced this headline a few hours later : SEX CRIME WAVE ROLLING HIGH And here are some of the opening sentences in the story : 16 " An even greater increase in the number of sexual assaults on women was flatly predicted today by Dr. Frederic Wertham , nationally known psychiatrist . The blame rests squarely on the shoulders of bogged down mental hygiene clinics , lurid TV and radio programs that make touching women a fine thing ' ? and on the public itself , said Dr. Wertham . What good does it do putting loo extra cops 17 on the street to protect women when the public has helped encourage these attacks . . . . And meanwhile the public , the TV programs , the sexy-minded radio shows and the comic books are helping to build these fires in the kids of today who will be the potential rapists of tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rape cases as we now have . . . . Look at our entertainment media ! The average young boy is shown , or told , that it 's proper and glamorous to hang , punch , rip clothes off , kick or spank a woman . He gets it from all sides ? movies , TV , radio and comics . Only last week I had a case of a 13-year-old boy who assaulted an 8-year-old girl , tying her hands above her head . Where did he learn that ? He saw it on TV , or heard it through a propaganda medium . " In answer to Dr. Wertham 's question as to what good it would ( to to put extra cops on the street to protect women , most of us would answer that it would do some good and that was why it was being done . There are many of us in TV who would like to ask Dr. Wertham a question in turn . He has done a good deal of studying and he may have an answer . Dr. Wertham is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at N. Y. University , Director of the Mental Hygiene Clinic of Bellevue Hospital , Director of the Mental Hygiene Clinic of Queens General Hospital , Director of Lafargue Clinic in Harlem , Fellow of the American Academy of Medicine , the American  | Association for the Advancement of Science , the New York Academy of Medicine , the National Research Council , and member of the American Association of Neuropathologists , Association for Research in Mental and Nervous Diseases , New York County Medical Society , and the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy . Here is the question : how does Dr. Wertham know that the 13-year-old boy learned how to assault the 8-year-old girl on a TV program ? Would he suggest that perhaps Mr. Sotman got the idea of tying his own 8-year-old to the steam-pipe by seeing it happen first on TV ? He does n't know . He 's guessing . That 's why he gave himself and his reader another choice : " . . . or heard it through a propaganda medium . " " Our general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radio , movie and comic book writers add fuel to the fire . I ask you : just compare the number of sexy TV , radio and movie shows with the number of clinics fighting sexual problems and you have the answer ! " You do n't have any such thing ! You do n't have anything more than Dr. Wertham 's answer , unargued , presumptive , convenient , and visionary . Considering the number of meetings Dr. Wertham seems eligible to attend , and the hospital schedule he maintains , it is n't surprising there 's little time for looking at any of the TV shows he 's talking about , or going to the movies , or reading the comics , or listening to the radio . A solid week of objective viewing might neutralize some of this ferment . For a doctor , bent nearly double with degrees , he seems more buccal than cranial . To what would he have ascribed a comparable outburst of sexual violence forty years ago ? Chautauqua ? A colleague of Dr. Wertham , Dr. Renatus Hartogs , who works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , and who is less chemical in his judgments and more adjusted ( Hartogs is at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where you get a good TV image ) , also thinks TV could be part of the trouble , but he gets closer to specifics than Dr. Wertham . Under the heading : " Social Snafu Must Share Blame for Sex Crimes , Psychiatrist Says , " Dr. Hartogs does n't bang away at everything TV is doing  | but only at " certain types of television programs . " From there he goes , quite purposefully and directly for a psychiatrist , and without any hypnagogic orthovagatonic perissological divaricating 18 whatever , to several other underlying causes ( besides TV ) that he felt may have explained the then growing number of sex attacks on women in New York parks and vestibules , and he mentions the following : the publication of detailed reports on vice ( prostitution ) ; publicity about Hollywood divorces and love affairs and the exaggerated importance given them , contributing in turn to sexual stimulation ; reports of police corruption and accompanying feeling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary seductiveness in behavior and way of dressing ( on part of victims of sex aggression ) ; out-dated prison parole systems , overcrowded mental hospitals ( Dr. Wertham has mentioned this often and courageously fought for improvement ) ; inadequate housing conditions . He has two other conclusions I find of great applicability , one of them a general observation , the other a particular : " In war , feelings of insecurity and aggressiveness originate very easily . " " All sex offenders which I have had opportunity to examine and treat suffer from rather severe personality disturbance , emotional immaturity , and social incompatibility , and they find outlets for emotional tension , conflict and frustration through anti-social , deviant , or aggressive sexual behavior . " If , to the above thoughts , Dr. Hartogs had added the magnification that is sometimes given to stories of racy misconduct on any level , then I would say that Dr. Hartogs ' analysis of the causes behind the 1951-1952 rash of misconduct in New York was about right . I would say so anyhow ; and say that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in documented fact to be further noted . But look at the publicity he got when he said it ! Most psychiatrists , as seen by radio and television , share two things in common : no matter how old the psychiatrist is , he still his enough spring in his knees to leap to a public platform as it he were twenty . That is one thing . The other is that among the many who profess to hate television , most who say so are dying to get on it and save us all . It is entirely possible we had ( river disturbances before they camel It is also possible that I  | have a slight prejudice here . For twelve years I have lived in a standard New York apartment building of forty-eight units . Within the past five years forty-four of these units have been taken by psychiatrists . Their patients come up and go down in our regular elevators , and on them I have been innocently privy to a couple of conversations the psychiatrists do n't yet dare try to classify , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better off if we segregated all the psychiatrists and made them all treat each other , leaving the rest of us alone with our " normal abnormalities . " This way psychiatrists would become self-exterminating in a few days ; and productive energies , now hopelessly complicated by the most ludicrous and deceitful vocabulary since the Jabberwock , would find their own way back to usefulness . Or perish ? as they would and should and did before psychiatry . Most metropolitan psychiatrists are daily practicing the most shameful glasshearted cynicism that is appearing in any of our professions , and are protected from the law by this very vocabulary ; and by spectacles , unpressed pants , Viennese accents , joyously self-pitying patients , impermeable moral carapaces , and greed . No psychiatrist , for example ? before or since the VOCABULARY ? has ever rescued an alcoholic from his liquor and turned him into a normal drinker . There is no turning an alcoholic into a normal drinker ? not ever ? yet in New York City there are n't five psychiatrists who know this , admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat " him . " **52;1315;TOOLONG " they say , and send him forth to his tragic stumblings and his ruin , accompanied by a crushing bill . Do you expect to find the whole truth about comics , for example , in Dr. Frederic Wertham 's book Seduction of the Innocent ? Of course not . You find only the worst side of it . Yet these things are happening every day ? and appearing as headlines that hurt television , or radio , or comics . There is evil in them all , and this evil ought to be pointed out , and corrected , or controlled or stopped . But with what kind of weapons can television be expected to meet the kind of adversary who fights this way ? ( and I shall quote but one paragraph ) ; " Fatigue and emotional excitement from early or late television programs , "  | Dr. Elghammer said , " offer the most fertile field fox an attack of strep infection or a reactivation of rheumatic fever . " 19 Could not this medical man have said ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional excitement from early or late barn chores " ? Or " early or late pole-vaulting practice under inadequate floodlighting " ? It is as casuistical a dislocation of scientific output as Wertham 's noble endeavour to stick radio and television ( and comics ) with New York 's 1952 rape-rate . When these sesquipedalian motive-hunters suddenly come to , and run head-on into the fact that men want women ? and that is the primary reason the sexes are here , and different ? they will drop dead with surprise and disappointment . To me it is a statistic almost as frightening as it is funny ( I do not believe it has been recorded before ) that in all the jungleminded dictionaries behind which psychiatrists live ( and hide ) , not one defines the word " happy . " Nor the quality or state of " happiness . " Not one even lists the word . It is n't in their book ! What possible expectation can there be that such men can address normal people when their entire study is the finding and cataloging of freaks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in New York City who is having her dog analyzed . Is this funny ? Certainly . But it is also sadly reflective of the decay and the cynicism and the euphoric lunacy of the " profession " that she could find a psychoanalyst who would solemnly accept a dog as a patient . Think what Dickens would say of this modern school of gling-glong body-snatchers ! It can be very easily established that we are living in a fruity society and a wobbly age , but would it not be a sign of better times if more and more dog-owners leased out their ( logs to give , rather than receive , the analyses ? They could make first approaches to this simply by exchanging licenses . Medical men on the podium , psychiatrists in particular , are doing shabby disservices to television every day . I think the metropolitan psychiatrist is the biggest swindler in this country today ,  | and I think television should answer him every time he attacks it . And name him . In regard to very large-caliber public distresses such as delinquency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radio and television point out some of the basic disturbance factors in con ? temporary American life ? ( See Juvenile Delinquency Chart on this page . ) The complex position of American women in American life today is seldom mentioned as being one of the great causes of friction in the American home . Seldom mentioned ( when TV is being accused of contributing to delinquency ) is the number of women who have homes but who work outside the home as well . It is 19,000,000l This is a very important statistic . It represents 30 percent of the total employed population ! In the opinion of Dean Helen G. Canoyer of the college of Home Economics at Cornell , this means that the position of women in America today is seriously jeopardized . She says : " So long as we continue to live in a semi-armed state , women not only may , but must take jobs . But woman 's creative urge normally includes the desire to marry and bear children . The difficulty of filling their traditional feminine role as well as their more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women today . The goals set by each are different .   And the personality traits each evokes are often diametrically opposed . " The position of women today is potentially explosive . Often women who work are troubled and anxious about the homes they must also manage . Many women feel they must make an unbearable choice , and some are unhappy whichever role they choose . This can produce maladjusted children who reflect their mother 's discontent . " 20 With so many mothers out working ( in addition to fathers ) , it must be hard to check on truancy in many homes . And this may partially explain the jump in the nation 's truancy rate , up .16 percent in four years for the schools of New York City . And what 's in it for a hooky cop ( now called " attendance officers " ) anyhow ? " Theirs is an endless task , a daily job that often begins long before 7 a.m. , when parents must be reached before they go to work . " Frightening but sadly familiar to many New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgressions were not the sole responsibility of the schools . About half the young persons in the 13 to 21 category ? the so-called ' teen-agers ' ? are not in school at all and can not be reached by the schools . " 22 Of those who get into trouble ( but who are lucky enough to wind up at the State Training School for Boys at Warwick , New York ) , what kind of homes had they come from ? On this subject A. Alfred Cohen , Superintendent at Warwick has a stark answer : " I have never met a youngster among the 8,000 who have passed through Warwick in the time I have been there who had n't been beaten physically by experts ? drunken parents , psychotic parents , or sadistic relatives . " During the same interview , Mr. Cohen made another observa- tion just as condemning : " Many of these kids literally have never had a hot meal before they came to Warwick ; never had a full night 's sleep . " What have our juvenile delinquents done ? " Juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred for stealing or committing malicious mischief . " Most of the girl delinquents are brought in for being ungovernable , for running away , or for having committed sexual offenses . " Police fingerprint arrest records used by the FBI reveal that in 1951 young people under 18 years of age committed : 24% of auto thefts 19% of all burglaries 7% of rapes 3% of homicide cases 2% of assault cases " During the first 6 months of 1952 more serious crimes were committed by boys and girls 18 years old than by persons of any other age . " 24 At what age do juveniles tend to get into trouble ? " The majority of boys and girls who come before juvenile courts for delinquency are between 15 and 17 years of age . " Approximately 35% of these young people who come before the courts have been there before on one or more occasions . " In a study of 500 delinquent boys the fact was brought out that the age at which the largest number first appeared in court was between a and 13 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal social life before they were 11 years old . " Almost half of the group were giving noticeable signs of becoming delinquent at the age of 8 or younger . " 25 In the United States in 1953 , major crime rates ( with the excep-  | tion of murder , which decreased slightly ) rose 20 percent , while the population has risen ( since 1950 ) only 5 percent . The total number of major crimes committed in the United States in 1953 was 2,159,080 . By " major " is meant : murder , negligent manslaughter , rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , larceny , and auto theft . Car thieves stole 226,530 automobiles , 26 and of these juveniles comprised 53.6 percent of all those arrested for automobile theft . Just under half of all those arrested for burglary were not yet 18.27 Of the total number arrested for all crimes ( 1,791,160 ) , 8.4 percent were under 17 ; 14.7 percent were under 21 . Burglars stole more than $78,000,000 in 1953 . Vandalism is spreading . It always does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little or no supervision . In New York the Sharkey Bill ( offered by Majority Leader Joseph T. Sharkey , a Brooklyn Democrat ) has been introduced again , advocating slapping a fine of up to $25 on parents for depredations committed by their children in parks or schools . The new bill involves all damage to private property . ( Vandalism bills in New York 's City Council in 1952 nearly passed , but were twice defeated in the Board of Estimate when Robert Wagner , now New York 's mayor and then Borough President of Manhattan , broke an 8-8 tie by casting a negative vote . ) Since Wagner has become mayor there have been some changes in the Board of Estimate . It may pass . It is now in the General Welfare Committee . Among the strongest proponents for the success of this bill is Park Commissioner Moses , in my personal judgment ( speaking as an old-line New Yorker ) the finest public servant this city has ever had . He knows where the trouble is and he knows how to fix it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've got to get at them by fines , if you 're going to realize anything in our lifetime . " The popular theory that " education of the public " will eliminate vandalism is " rubbish " to Mr. Moses . Have you heard of All-pay Neighborhood Schools in New York ? They may be a reasob , able solution to much of this oversize headache of vandalism and kids on the loose ; kids with both   parents working . Mrs. Broadus Mitchell , Chairman of its Citizens ' Committee , puts it this way : " Let us have more schools where delinquency is dealt with before it happens . " How does it work ? It keeps the schools open two extra hours , attendance at that time voluntary . Inducements ? Participation in administrative functions such as selling and delivering milk in the school , collecting money for school lunches , aiding in the library , operating visual-aid equipment . Children are also taken on tours to markets and local restaurants where they can compare prices and methods with those of their school lunchroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a special key that lets them into school . They 're known as the " Door-Key Kids . " Over-all cost for such programs ( in each school ) is roughly $50,000 a year , which includes the extra staff and materials . The children receive a thorough academic education , and in addition they tour their city a great deal , see all its centers of activity , get to know how they work . Assistant Director Adele Franklin reports an increasing waiting-list every year . Who are these " DoorKey Kids " ? They are teen-agers whose fathers and mothers work all day , and who would otherwise have to return to empty homes after school . Do you know who Terry McGovern is ? He 's another great public servant . He has a lot of fun out of his sideline as well . Thirty years ago he founded the Sand Lots Baseball Leagues . About 6,000 boys each year in Greater New York ( the total for the 3o years is a little over 175,000 ) play ball on a regular competitive sched ule with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination inter-sectional baseball . They have a World Series in the fall . Here 's an amazing statistic about the Sand Lots Baseball story in New York given to me by McGovern himself on " Casey Stengel Night " at the Players Club in New York three nights before the major league season opened in April , 1954 : " Not one of my 175,000 boys has ever been up on a juvenile delinquency charge ! " The Department of Health , Education , and Welfare in Washington does not maintain a reference file of reports appraising the effect of television on delinquency . When I asked them for such if it existed ( and they are an unusually cooperative and responsive group ) they wrote back at once , furnishing three titles , two of them in related fields , and the third one ? Television and   Our Children by Robert Lewish Shayon ? already commented upon with some thoroughness in this book . The other two were a pamphlet of the Public Affairs Committee , by Josette Frank , 28 titled Comics , Radio , Movies ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) put out by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations in New York called : Exploding a Myth : Motion Pictures Are Not Responsible for Juvenile Delinquency . The vindication of television on all counts and at all levels is not my purpose . However , the most direct charge I have encountered ( extremely respectable because of its source ) is from IIarry J. Anslinger , United States Commissioner of Narcotics , one of the world 's greatest authorities on the drug traffic . Because I believe that poverty , drugs , and alcohol are the great breeders of juvenile delinquency ( and the " working-mother " very often a by-product of the first ) , I wish to quote Commissioner Anslinger where his opinions and findings relate specifically to our subject : 29 " For the past several years , the general public has been bombarded with stories , articles , pictures , programs , discussions , and speeches dealing with all phases of drug addiction . Headlines such as ' Twenty-five Housebreaks are Charged to Drug Addict , ' ' Doped by Marihuana , Youth " Goes Crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killed Wife During Marihuana Brawl , ' ' TeenAge Drug Addict Ring Uncovered , ' ' Gang of Marihuana-Crazed Hoodlums Leaves Bloody Trail , ' ' Accused Killer Tells of " Marihuana Fog , " " Killer Tells of Smoking Marihuana Before Holdtip , ' ' Police Seize " Reefers " in Gang Raid ' have become commonplace in our daily press . Radio and television shows have featured the dope fiend , and publishers of cheap fiction have not hesitated to use the indefensible and lurid stories involving addicts to enhance their sales . The wrong kind of publicity on narcotics : night be divided into three classes :   " i . Sensational material designed to promote sales " 2 . Misguided use of material " 3 . Inaccurate reporting . " Later on , Commissioner Anslinger says : " Furthermore , sponsor and radio stations who should know better , on occasion have foisted amazingly disreputable dope fiend ' pictures into the living room . " And as to his second point ( misguided use of material ) , he says , in part : " By it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , through inherent flaws or inaccuracies , hinder rather than help the over-all situation . The bulk of the material in this class consists of writings intended for education and educational films and while the sales aspect is generally secondary , it is undeniably there . . . . This is not a subject where writing flows without careful thought . It is no field in which to experiment with unproved ideas , fanciful suggestions , or curbstone opinions . One of the more unfortunate aspects of the whole situation has been created by the outpourings from pseudo-experts since the problem of drug addiction has become widely publicized . A few normally intelligent educators , who should know better , after a cursory study , came forward with unbelievable conclusions and suggestions , some of which were diametrically opposite to the views of life-long students of the subject ... . On motion pictures : " Fortunately for the welfare of our country , the Motion Picture Producers Association of America has a provision in their code governing the industry to the effect that its members can not produce films showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were it not for this commendable self-imposed restriction by the motion-picture industry , the public would be continually subjected to the presentation of numerous motion pictures with a narcotic theme , with a strong potential increase in drug addiction . . . . " The Commissioner cites the following case in point : " A highly reputable firm recently produced a film ( not approved by the Motion Picture Producers Association of America ) avowedly aimed at the problem of drug addiction and represented  | as propaganda against the use of narcotics . The film was intended for showing in secondary schools . It opens with an intended educational approach in that it portrays the plants opium , cocoa , and marihuana and explains the derivation of the narcotics pi inciples . Then a happy school environment is portrayed while the commentator builds up the menace of drug addiction . Next is seen experimentation by groups of young people and progression from marihuana smoking ( including some technique ) to ' mainline ' 30 use of heroin . Scenes follow this phase depicting the necessity of obtaining money to sustain addiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop-lifting , proceeding to the furtive meetings of drug peddler and addict , and the coercion of the addict into becoming a seller to support his addiction . Comparatively mild withdrawal symptoms are displayed as the compelling reason for continuance of the addiction . The addict ' hero ' is pictured as a good boy with a kind sympathetic mother . He has strayed into bad company ultimately leading to his downfall , arrest for shop-lifting , and discovery on his person of his ' works ' and some capsules of heroin . Arraigned before the Juvenile Court in a tearful scene , he is placed on probation to undergo a cure . The impression gained of the cure is that it is pleasant , quick , and certain , featuring desirable occupational therapy , followed by a return to his former environment where he is shunned by the good boys and girls . Among the inherent weaknesses of this approach are the following : " 1 . It vividly pictures the appearance of growing marihuana which might lead some youngsters to experiment . " 2 . It portrays addiction as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal and healthy environment . This is inaccurate .   " 3 . It teaches the technique of mugging , robbing , shop-lifting , and the peddling of drugs . " 4 . It shows the technique for smoking marihuana. " 5 . It depicts the withdrawal of drugs as a mildly uncomfortable affair rather than in its true vicious light . " 6 . It shows treatment merely as a pleasant occupational therapy . " 7 . It conveys the impression that addiction can be cured like the measles which is wholly incorrect . The statistics on recividism alone shatter that conclusion . " He presents some challenging questions from the chapter headed " Narcotics , Crime and Publicity " : " It seems reasonable to inquire why it is necessary to produce such a picture . Does a solution to this terrible problem demand that the general public and our youth be saturated with knowledge no matter how indiscriminately it is ladled out ? Does this subject necessitate lurid and sensational treatment rather than the careful and considered discussions attendant on such ills as sex perversion and syphilis ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with illustrations concerning the techniques of sex perversion . Then why single out drug addiction ? Drug addiction is sporadic and not widespread in the United States . Consequently , an avalanche of educational material is unnecessary ; it too often arouses curiosity and leads to addiction . " On " Problems of Reporting " he cites this caution : " City editors who find a speculative mention of marihuana in a reporter 's story would be doing a great public service if they would refuse to use it in their headlines . " And this caution to radio and television : " One final thought for both producers and sponsors ? stop building detective stories around drug addicts . Generally the facts are distorted , the plots abominable , and the youngsters ' curiosity improperly and unduly aroused thereby . One fact is inescapable ? unless the subject of narcotics and its criminal offshoots are treated with utmost care and accuracy , more damage than good can result . " I agree with everything the Commissioner says . I believe the editorial controls of radio and television also agree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautions into the NARTB Code ( items " g " and " h " ) under the heading " Acceptability of Program Material " ( see Appendix III ) . There have , in truth , been some indiscretions here , though I do not recall ever seeing or hearing of any that were excessive or technically informative from the point of view of showing the process of dilution or preparation of drugs for use or sale , or any of the sordid techniques of " needle-work . " As a rule , in these " abominable " plots in the average detective story on radio or TV ( and I have n't enough courage to argue with the Commissioner or anyone else about his adjective ) , " villainy " is at once established if any character is known to be in any way identified with dope ( when they do occur they are usually " pushers " or the " dope syndicate boss , " not users ) . This villainy is established ( in TV today ) in almost exactly the same way as was the suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' 30 's ? merely by having the woman ( always young , always from the " city , " usually divorced ) smoke cigarettes , indicating that " a woman who smokes will do anything . " In a conversation I had in the late 1940 's , in the home of radio and television producer Jerry Danzig , with the colorful Inspector Peter Terranova ( Commanding Officer of New York 's Narcotics Squad ) , he told me that in raid after raid ( a majority of them in Harlem ) , few of the parents are ever shocked when they are ! , resented with the bad news that one or another of their teen-age c children has just been picked up with the " works . " The degree of parental apathy on the one hand and of professional depravity on the other is likely to tax your emotions if you allow it to start . For example , in the same talk with Peter Terranova I found out that one sordid fact making detection of peddling so much more difficult is that many peddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because they know narcotics agents ( marvelously disguised and unrecognizable though they are ) have got to be older than i6 ! I do n't remember that we ever put a camera on a needle in the long run of Man Against Crime that starred Ralph Bellamy , although this is the kind of show Commissioner Anslinger has in mind . And dope was featured in these plots many times . And killed people , or drove them to crimes . We turned back the eyelids of numerous corpses , supposedly to find the pupil contracted  | and the deceased dead from using dope , and Mr. Bellamy was hit over the head every Wednesday night ( moved to Fridays later on ) by unprincipled gorillas whose methods of restraining Mr. Bellamy showed some variety of weapons used , but whose gay conversations while knocking Bellamy 's brains out remained almost identical for five years . I do n't believe anyone has learned anything of a destructive nature in radio or television shows on the use , method of injecting , or procurement of narcotics . But it is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a temptation among new script writers ( you can always spot their stuff by how much they have to " lean " on the new talk ) , but a serious breach anywhere in this area is extremely unlikely . There are too many veterans around ; the business is so carefully selfpoliced that suspicious material or the overplay on any suggestive scene ( or prop ) would be picked up and thrown out long before stand-up rehearsals . Networks know the dangers here , and have for a long time . They know the impossibility of using their own powers of visualization to educate the public against narcotics ; what they can say , and what they ca n't say ; what they ca n't show . Network libraries and program editors ( and producers ) are aware of such published facts as have been released from time to time ? many from the League of Nations Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs ? on the dangers of doing harm instead of good . Tightening of the laws would help in several directions . Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have talked in regard to this problem , was an enthusiastic supporter of a proposal to the Attorney General : " I believe that possession of a definite number of marihuana cigarettes , say 50 , should constitute a felony . As it is now the number is limitless . Fifty marihuana cigarettes found on a person should constitute presumptive evidence that he is going to sell them . " I have gone into this because I think radio and television have often been damaged by headlines when they have not been even presumptively guilty ( in such charges as contributing to juvenile delinquency ) and damaged in about the same way Commissioner Anslinger has cited as being detrimental to the special and acutely sensitive work he is doing . As to the theme of juvenile delinquency , that is an entirely  | separate issue . It is , for example , the subplot of a daytime serial in television which I am currently writing . ( CBS-TV , Channel 2 , " The ' Secret Storm , " sponsored by Whitehall Pharmacal ) . How the boy got into trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too overwhelmed with his own grief to pay proper attention ) what is done for and to him while he 's in trouble , how he gets out of it and how he is restored to his family is quietly and soberly examined according to the best-known rehabilitation techniques with which our government and communities supply us . This kind of programming has great educational value because it is delivered as drama , and under the most natural and believable domestic conditions . It has technical corrective value too , because in this show we are putting into use the best techniques known to juvenile delinquency experts . In fact , we are working very closely with the United States Government in the planning and backgrounding of this phase of " The Secret Storm . " Before leaving the juvenile delinquent , what about the poor juveniles who are n't delinquent at all ? They represent a mere 95 percent of the total ! Do they like being branded as " dirty by association " ? Indeed they do not like it . In fact , they wo n't stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra money by doing after-school work are being denied jobs because of the bad reputations of some of the high schools . A small percentage can ruin the reputation of a whole school . Some high schools not at all deserving the stigma are being called " training academies for gangsters . " The Student Congress in Bergenfield High School ( New Jersey ) demanded a showdown with the truth.31 This high school was developing such a sinister reputation that the students , when attending games at other schools in North Jersey , were often subjected to insults for being hoodlums . If you are n't a hoodlum , you do n't like this . The showdown with the truth took the form of two " truth assemblies , " attended by all i , ioo students of Bergenfield High . The students demanded , and received , acknowledgment that charges of rampant juvenile delinquency among them were based on activities of a very few ( the usual case ) . They demanded a  | public declaration " to clear the air " and give the satisfaction of public acquittal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sergeant Anthony Libonati told the student assembly that the investigation had turned up only 38 actual offenders , and of these 38 , only 12 were involved in such offenses as vandalism , theft , and weapon carrying . Self-respect has returned to this high school . It would be a good thing if such challenges became general through the United States . I 've spent many hours talking with Martin Gula , a brilliant young consultant in the Children 's Bureau of the United States Department of Health , Education , and Welfare ( Oveta Culp Hobby 's Department ) . He has interviewed hundreds of delinquents at " Intake Stations " and followed their histories and rehabilitations , and he stated " as long as we continue to believe there is one cause for delinquency , we 'll get nowhere . There are always many causes . There always were . Any healthy enjoyment that makes the child or teen-ager want to stay with his family ? instead of making him want to escape his family ? is good for him . Television is one of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohesions of this kind can only promote family harmony . " If television is creating juvenile delinquency I ca n't find out how or where . And I have certainly looked . It is my own belief that a much stronger case for its influence in the opposite direction can be made . Allen Villiers , who has sailed schooners around the world with boys ' crews of teen-agers many times now , has a problem and a solution : " To keep them out of trouble , keep them tired . " There has never been a fight on his ships , and he 's never lost a " hand " from the rigging . Villiers is an expert at anticipating frictions between these young " midshipmen " and can always " arrange errands aloft " before trouble breaks . Parents with refractory or restless children ca n't keep them out of trouble by " keeping them tired , " but it would seem reasonable that " keeping them busy " with family viewing ( a few shows selected each day ) is not only an intelligent diversionary tactic when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the family to develop as a unit , one to observe as a part of everyday living . It 's available to everyone . Should n't it be enjoyed together ?   RADIO AND TELEVISION DID N'T CREATE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN MIND . It was here before . Educators have trouble understanding this . They do n't deal with the average American mind . In television where come-uppances are faster than they were in radio , there is hope that the whole morass of false purpose which so many educators brought to radio will be drained and dug out and lined with new brick , so that clear channels for the proper run-off of respectable educational purposes can begin to turn into a system that makes some sense ; a system that will irrigate areas that need it ; a system that can be looked at ( and criticized ) by everybody all the time . Now it is only being criticized . And no one sees the same thing in the same way . We might begin by saying that the non-specific is usually fatal in radio and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educational groups ( it would be fairer to say " spokesmen for groups " ) ? in their earlier relations with TV ? is , in too many chapters , a story of empty enthusiasm , committee chairmen , and waste . Right now in television this same quality of empty enthusiasm ( because the " romantic appeal " of television is so much stronger ) is urging entire groups of educators to permit themselves to be photographed , as it were , at the foot of   Mt . Everest before their assault on the summit has begun , even before their equipment has arrived . Educators deserve blame for this , but there is some mitigation of blame for a fault that is ascribed to the teachers when it is often not theirs at all . And here it is : a dull but dangerous few who are not teachers themselves are speaking too often for the whole teaching profession . Absence of basic purpose was the main reason educators failed in radio . Nebulosity of purpose was another . It was never lack of skill . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers were never set to teaching . There was a third reason , though , why educators failed in radio . It was a matter of attitude toward a condition . It may not be too crude a simplification to call this the condition of the American university police state . To be sure , this is an amiable state , but think how well policed , and what that means ! If a student fails to conform to local standards of conduct , fails in classroom responsiveness , fails to reach required exam percentages , fails to show up , or shows up late too often , he can be fined , or suspended , reprimanded , confined to campus , or kicked out . It will be assumed that this is a good plan , the enthusiasms of young people being more or less constant . And it can be assumed too that these disciplines and penalties are of benefit to the student after he 's left the institution that tried to teach him the classroom facts and has joined another institution such as typical American business that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to make a little money out of him , and permit him to make a little for himself . That is roughly the way it goes . That is not even remotely the way it goes when the educator decides to address the off-campus audience . The professor brings his campus manner , his campus message and technique to the studio . What does he find ? He finds that the student has merged with the other hundred and sixty million free Americans and that he ca n't be fined or rusticated . He ca n't even be found . The professor , when sitting before his first microphone or before  | his first camera , is a lonely man . For years he 's enjoyed the uncertain serenity but the certain authority that faculties could fire students . He is now in the presence of a student body that can fire the faculty : and a student body that does so . This is a truant body , and though never beyond the reach of interest , forever outside the law . These truants tune him in , sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson the educator has to learn : nobody has to listen to him any more , and nobody will if he 's dull . In the whole history of educational radio there have been few first-class educators who knew this ; who really knew it , who practiced the indicated scales and octaves , and who survived . Lyman Bryson of CBS was and is one of these . He is one of the most civilized and articulate men on the network . He 's quick , humorous , alive , and resourceful ? at home in any man 's world on any level . He 's entertaining , patient , exploratory , and almost magically simple . It is practically impossible for this man to bore anyone . ' Television brought to millions a few years ago equally delightful enthusiasms and the wide-ranging curiosities and revelations of another educator , Roy Kenneth Marshall . And Dr. Marshall brought along , in addition to an oversized bundle of controversy , a large supply of straight talk that did us all some good . When asked how he could give up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " To be honest about it , there 's a lot of money in this television business . " 2 He believed that education via TV should reach the public through commercial outlets : " I disapprove the segregation of culture on one channel . I do n't care how snobbish you are ? a door marked entertainment ' is more inviting than one marked education . ' " He suspected educators were insufficiently prepared to run TV stations . " I do n't think a school should be given a channel until it  | draws up a complete program schedule and does a dry run . ' There 's been no real appreciation by the educators of the problem involved in operating their own stations . " Of the university clamor for educational films he said : " If they 're so interested in visual education , why do n't they make their own films " ? ( They do n't know how to , that 's why . ) Should scholars do the teaching ? No . " You have to pick a personality that comes right through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , you ca n't use gimmicks . Nothing can be duller than a round-table discussion . Since philosophers can be dull , the same as astronomers , you have to rely on personality . " But very few of the reigning educators then agreed with Marshall . Twenty years ago they did n't agree with these same harsh verities ? that to be dull was to be dead ? and through the rejection of them they failed in radio . There is a chitinous vanity about certain professors ? or a snobbishness perhaps ; a tough coating in any case ? who want to be heard on radio or seen in TV that makes them dent-proof . They can not be persuaded ( for example ) that when going on the air they will be in immediate competition with professional performers , commercial vulgar performers who work for fees , and who may not be as well educated as professors . They can not be persuaded that when going on the air they will be competing for the leisure time of a few million unclassifiable invisibles in the biggest free-for-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be persuaded that they are performing , and that the attention they win and hold is in proportion to their performance-value and nothing else . If they ca n't perform they should n't be allowed to go on . Educators heroically refuse to learn the difference between brains and talent . They are the hardest people to educate in America today . Here is the terrible truth of it : scholarship and showmanship are deadly enemies . It is just as ridiculous for teachers to move into studios and expect attention as it is for them to move into dental clinics and fix teeth . The fact that they , the teachers , are not technically and temperamentally qualified even though they may be ( and very often are ) masters of their subject is not the full story of their failure either , although being temperamentally unsuitable or  | technically shortweight would in itself guarantee their failure . But assuming that a teacher has no temperamental deficiency , that he or she is poised , ready , easy and quick of mind , assuming that there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still be a large danger area , and that danger is in regard to audience . It might be better to say in regard to the teacher 's attitude toward audience . " Not to envy those who know more , but to pity those who know less " should be in their minds always . Is it ? It almost never is . To know audience composition is the most sedulously sought information of nearly everybody in radio ( and television ) . To professional radio and television people ( and to be other than professional is to be wasteful ) knowledge of audience composition is as governing as it is challenging . Yet educators usually come to the microphone quite spoiled ? spoiled by the direct carry-over into the Free State of radio listening ( or TV viewing ) of the authority they held in the educational Police State . Educators would sooner not know who their audience is , and indeed the story of who this audience is is a fearsome story . Here 's a set of six simple questions : i . Where is Manchuria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is NATO ? 4 . Who is Chiang Kai-shek ? 5 . Who is Marshal Tito ? 6 . What do people mean when they refer to the 38th Parallel ? There is no doubt about what the educators can do with this Iist . They will pass the quiz with ease . What should interest them is this : only one-tenth of the adult population of this nation can answer all those questions . One-fifth of the adult population of this nation ca n't answer any of them . What am I talking about here ? I am talking about pity in the presence of stupidity , and patience in the face of ignorance . And a large unbreaking sympathy that educators must cultivate if they do not have it now . Seventy-seven percent of our voting public never heard of Point Emir , and only one man in twenty can tell you what it is trying to do . Americans do n't know where Iran is , what the Marshall //   Plan was , who Naguib is , what job Dean Acheson held , what the RFC was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent of the Federal debt is missed by the average American by a hundred and fifty billion dollars ! Yet we Americans are but two percent illiterate , and the people who ca n't answer these questions are voters ! This is of grave interest to radio and television people . It is of no interest to educators , not yet . Educators do n't move among people this benighted , this dumb ( if you wish the common term for it ) . But radio and television people do . All day and every day . So does George Gallup . The above questions were his . To know the audience is to know the problem ? the size and composition of the audience . Not to know is romance . Television is not in that business . But there are still many educators who are . Here 's a noteworthy example of educators actually photographed while romancing . The New York State Board of Regents is on record ( in declaring its right to TV channels ) with these words : " It is as important for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have classrooms .3 The television channels are the most valuable natural resource the people possess today . We , the Regents , maintain we have a first mortgage on those channels and we 're going to fight for them . " This quote is interesting for several reasons . John P. Myers , Chancellor of the Board of Regents , might properly have said it . So might Dr. Lewis A. Wilson , New York State Commissioner of Education . But neither of these men made the statement . It was another of education 's committee deals , the quote belonging to Jacob L. Holtzmann , chairman of a special committee appointed by the Board of Regents to " study " television . Mr. Holtzmann disapproves of things as they are , which is all right , but then he ca n't fix much when he 's drafted to do so , which is not all right . Mr. Holtzmann , who personally disapproves ( for example ) of   " children being told about the pleasures of beer drinking while they watched the Brooklyn Dodgers " and who wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what these alternatives are to be has not yet been outlined , but assures us that " expert teachers with a specific knack for giving instructions in a subject could be heard and seen by students all over the state as a supplement to the guidance that the youngsters normally receive from their own teachers . " This is pure but vague . Mr. Holtzmann was the appointment of the State Commissioner and he did a pretty good job of looking over a field that was more than a little confused . Now all that remains is for somebody else to make it bloom . When the man who makes the recommendation is the same man who has to stay with it till it 's working , education in television will be on its way out of the temporary warmth of its chrysalis . Dr. Lewis Wilson , even before his appointment as Commissioner , has been one of the ablest education administrators in the East . I laving a Board of Regents to worry about should be quite enough , without the dust-bowl problems a new UHF network is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,750,000 pupils will be attending public schools in New York State , and he wants the best for them all : " It is our democratic belief that every boy and girl in America intellectually fitted for advanced study should have the opportunity for higher or professional education . " That is a sample of his idealism . In addition to normal load of administrative responsibility common to all states ( in New York State it includes jurisdiction over 845 libraries , 6o art galleries , 40 museums , and 190 historical societies ) the Commissioner must pay for his idealism by being practical in the solution of such problems as these : the continued teacher shortage ( which is alarming ) ; the building shortage ( which is called " acute " ? it needs a cool billion right now to provide adequate classroom facilities ) ; improved leaching profession ( secondary teachers must have master 's degrees ) ; better teachers ' colleges , a stronger high school curriculum , and more guidance to meet the needs of pupils . This is a terrible load . But he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " job to a television man , someone who would n't have bothered to mention the Brooklyn Dodgers . This looks good in print . But it looks good nowhere else . An  | idealist wrote it . It will now just get lost . It can never happen from these influences , in fact . There are other agonies ahead for the teacher . Great teachers are often assassinated by other members of their own faculties . The instant a teacher evinces those very qualities Mr. Holtzmann speaks of , he often attracts the suspicion of his department head or the jealousy of his colleagues . ( The jealousy factor is immense , and do n't think it 's restricted to women ! ) The great teacher is first considered a non-conformist ; then his scholarship is questioned . Then he 's Meikeljohned . It is n't ( in this case ) that he 's afraid to teach , for such reasons as Dr. Hutchins has reported in Look.4 It 's that his own bosses keep him taped up and stifled . The older men do n't want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be spokesmen for departments . Why do chancellors and commissioners and educational administrators always go out of their way to bring in somebody from outside who has to " make a study " of television ? Why do n't they bring in someone from television who already knows what is there ? Somebody from inside ? Why did n't Chancellor Myers or Commissioner Wilson ( because they have been mentioned ) bring in Dean Kenneth Bartlett of Syracuse for this ? Or Davidson Taylor ? Or Gilbert Seldes ? Or Edward Stanley ? Or Lyman Bryson ? Or Leon Levine ? All of them men with a great reach of this problem , and a great sympathy , having had daily collisions with it for more than twenty years in a row . For that matter ? as to who might address himself to New York State 's educational television dilemma with more mental clarity and natural zeal than most and from a quite special interest ? what about Jack Gould of the New York Times ? 5 His reporting of this developing story , from every angle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basic belief ( in the ultimate good uses of this force ) that he would make sense the minute he joined the problem . People seldom think of newspapermen as having administrative uses anywhere outside of government . I do n't know why . Gould could put this on the map if it  | ever got Albany go-aheads . He 'd be almost impossible to fool in any area whether legal , jurisdictional , or program content . He has an instant recognition of the " big educational program , " even if it 's coming out of a coffee-pot station . Gould sees it big . He 's at the peak of his skill in this field , and at the peak of his enthusiasms . " Commercials " are always going to be just a little dirty to him , and I 'd never try to fight the case he makes against the quality of many of them . The commercial world simply " is not for " Jack Gould . The university world is . Probably it 's another one of those " bitter ironies " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so conspicuously right that they 're not seen because they are so obvious . This is the same irony that dogs the trail of educational shows that should be on the air but are n't . Good shows , simple to describe , shows with great purpose ? where are they ? Entombed in committee memos . Why ? Because chancellors are appointers of committee-chairmen . Could this be rescued in some simple way ? Yes , it could . How ? By giving directives to one or two men professionally identified with TV right now . There are men in the Ford Foundation who could start this tidal wave . There are n't many , only a few . But it does n't take many ? it only takes a few . The " most noble calling " is no more noble than any other , and it depends on the character of the men and women who serve it for the degree of its nobility . Institutions acquire no virtue just by being well-enough endowed to have copper roofing . Institutions represent nothing more than the thinking and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem that seldom gets aired . If teachers have more leisure than most other jobholders , the factor of their impractical or non-objective use of this leisure is no more discussable than , say , the factor of drinking among clergymen . Most teachers waste most of their leisure . Is this not indeed the truth ? I believe it is , but you will never hear it admitted elsewhere , for it is another of those minor subjects that tradition , self-interest , and intellectual mildew have combined to render invisible . What are some of the signs of impractical use of leisure ? Here 's one : with all the clamoring for free time on the networks , and now with the renewed demand for free television channels , no individual , no educational group , none of the committees that   pop up on the green lawns of the nation 's academies like so many sudden toadstools , has ever yet come to a radio station or a TV station with a complete plan . They wait for yours . In the United States today there does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specific purpose of bringing to America 's multitudes via radio and television the education which the educators think these multitudes should be getting . There is not even an approach to such a plan . This is a sign of impractical use of leisure . More practical use of leisure might be to rest Peter Zenger for a few weeks and stop burying Ann Rutledge and put some shows together revealing American energies at work in foreign countries . Live Americans . Telling the full story of Point Four ? just for example ? would thrill almost every American . Very few know much about it . Most know nothing at all . Point Four is thought by many to be America 's most effective single weapon against Communism . A large number of the working and administrative personnel of Point Four have been recalled , the strength of the plan is being taken away from it , many of the men ( and women ) who know the answers because they were on the scene delivering the answers are now back in America , anxious to talk , anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation has ever had . Individual educators ca n't turn this opportunity into a show , but their recognition of Point Four as a show opportunity ( together with the energy to pursue it ) could lead an inquirer into the presence of many men of experience who could help him . Just putting Point Four on radio , simply as a succession of reports that cover the plan 's labors for all the countries where this technical assistance and instruction have been offered and used ? this alone would be a new kind of reporting . It would be new both in scale and objective because it is an international experiment of a size never before attempted and purpose never before envisioned . Point Four is licking Communism everywhere it 's allowed to operate . It goes on working after the Americans have left . Americans would celebrate this if someone were to tell them it 's going on . Many of the returning crews of this gigantic effort are supplied with motion-picture film and almost all of them have   hundreds of " stills . " Supposing a prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four is the fullest so far , and suppose the same educator also suggested leasing supplementary footage from the March of Time library of films ( also the fullest so far ) and going on a network once a week for an hour for six months . Suppose this much of a start was proposed . Most of the story of Point Four could be shown to an audience as gratified as they are astonished at the way ( for once ) large sums of Federal money are being sensibly spent abroad . Not doled , either ; invested . The fruits of this are going to people in trouble , people in need ? in Nepal and the Cameroons and Ecuador . Americans do n't even know what 's in it for Americans ? it all seems so far away . But it 's no further away than the first Communist , and these are the peoples who will be Moscow 's captives if Point Four does n't help make them self-sustaining before then . It is n't far off . It 's only a few minutes . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical human purpose and its scope . It 's an all-American deal . And it 's unknown ! If any group ever approached a transmitter and said , " We think this is important and we 've done this much , " program builders would sit down from shock and fan themselves . Is there such a group ? And could they conceivably make such an offer ? Yes , there is , and yes , they could . Who 's in it ? I can think of three men who could start this : Jonathan Bingham , George Elsey , and Willard Espey . A fourth , Ben Hardy , is dead ? killed in a plane crash in 1951 while working for Point Four . I do n't know any of these men but I know who they are and what they did . Ben Hardy was the creator of Point Four . He was a Georgia newspaperman who joined the State Department , who thought up the idea there but could n't get anyone to pay attention to it . So he took it to a White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how it got into Truman 's inaugural address , even though to the very end both Robert Lovett and Charles S. Bohlen ( of the State Department ) discouraged the project ( " premature , " " vague " ) . It later received another push when Willard Espey ( of Readers Digest ) wrote a book called Brave New Program . The book described the work .  | The fourth man is Jonathan B. Bingham . He ran Point Four . He has reported on Point Four could be physically reconstructed by film , narration , maps , opticals , and actors , to make a television series . The public would soon tell you whether it was succeeding as a show . But this is how great ideas begin . Educators never get this practical with us . Program-builders would suffer shock if they got help on a subject a good deal older and far less dramatic than Point Four . I am thinking of Vocational Guidance . Everybody uses the phrase but no one ever gets a look , a real look , at the vocations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the high school graduates are asking . We have not been taken to the interiors of typical jobs by television . But television could do this well . And should do it . This could be just as much a fault of the industry as it is of the vocational guidance people , and this should be freely conceded . But the whole vocational guidance program , as now constituted , is not adaptable to radio or TV uses because it explores individual needs , as individual cases are taken up . It never shows the masses exactly what it is like to give your life over to Montana Mining and Smelting . Television can show the potential jobholder the real inside of every job in America . I have seen about 2,000,000 feet of industrial film . I feel certain the basic material for a great series , of impressive assistance to the uncertain young people who wander off our campuses and into our cities , is in that footage . Most of these earnest young people know so little about the world of industry and commerce , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation , manufacturing , packaging , selling or planning that they do n't even know what kind of questions to ask . Supposing " American Inventory , " which did an interesting single program on the subject of jobs for young people , did a whole series ? A different job every week ? Suppose it showed , with film and with comment ( from the men doing the jobs ) what the jobs were ? What kind of training was required , what prospects there were , what hazards , what kind of home you could expect to own in fifteen years , what kind of city you 'd be likely to live in , where your children would go to school , what sort of old-age   protections you could count on from your company , what qualities the company was looking for , through all pay scales , all risks , and all responsibilities ? Mostly , of course , the great American question : what are my chances for getting ahead here ? How much money ? Most of this film now exists . Some of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ( since it is training film ) would obviously be too detailed and too technical . But a great contribution to American youth can be made , by television , for all those now ready to take off on the daily business of living . There is no such show . And in the young student 's life there is no transition , just a jarring interval of incertitude , usually wasteful . A man gets a diploma , ( or does n't ) , then stumbles around till he gets a job . Often he gets badly hurt or badly misused , or irretrievably lost , perhaps for years . In America we ought to be better than that . Television could help . It could run a vocational guidance show that guided inquiring young people to vocations by showing an audience exactly what the job really is in pay , in training , in future , in satisfaction . This one is wide open . Could educators help assemble it ? Surely some of them could . And on many age and educational levels . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years old and over , 79.8 percent did not finish high school , 20.2 percent completed eight full years of grammar school , and only 6 percent had four years of college ( or more ) : 12,184,000 had no schooling whatsoever . Cooperation from American industry would be immediate . Taking America 's next generation to these thresholds could make a new television landmark on Sunday afternoon , with a captive audience of a new kind , receiving instruction and information and quiet exhilarations never before offered them by the medium . A union of these forces could occur . It is needed . And it could be fruitful . There is something else about it that will drive a few educators away from this point on : this show , on a regular basis , would be bound to attract sponsorship . Is it needed ? Can it be done ? It would surely seem so to me . Just ask the next man you see how he happened to get into the line of work that now occupies him . You will hear amazing stories of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or  | the other of these particulars : that they were urged to get into the same business their father was in , or they were urged not to get into it . Mostly they were urged not to get into anything that even resembled the kind of work their father did or does . Very few fathers like what they do . Most want something better ( usually in the material sense ) for their sons.6 But almost none of them can assay the broad field and make sensible suggestions ? detached , reasoned , and accurately reported . They know only their own business and their own experience in that business , and they either like it or hate it . There are many kinds of fathers and there are all kinds of exceptions to this , but most sons get tossed up on a strange beach after four years on a voyage to Homer , Schiller , King Lear , and cosine functions with even less idea of the land before them than they had before embarking . They think they can navigate when they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing as vocational guidance in the average American college . There is some for high schools , ( though never enough ) and some of the pitiable human losses in misdirection are being looked at ( with a view to their correction ) by Dr. John Allan Smith , the vocational guidance supervisor for the Los Angeles City school system . What Paul Witty is doing regarding TV in the average home in suburban Chicago , Dr. Smith is doing regarding what happens to high school graduates after they get out : both men are making continuous surveys and releasing their findings at regular intervals . If television did no more than show its Los Angeles audience the work that Dr. Smith is doing ( and the vocational needs that this work is quietly dramatizing ) , the second step would soon follow by public demand . Television would get in the business of telling America 's youth about the jobs that are open to all , because recognition of this need would hit so many hard enough to make them vocal . And in the interests of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates of Los Angeles ' nine high schools , and the same 2,000 are to be kept track of , into middle life , at five-year intervals .   When first surveyed , this was the score : 1 . The number of graduates who had gone to college was less than half the number of those who had taken college-preparatory instruction with the intention of enrolling. 2 . A sixth of the boys and two-thirds of the girls were in clerical jobs ; another sixth from each sex in selling jobs . Yet only a third of these girls , and one-twentieth of the boys had majored in commercial or business education courses . 3 . Two-fifths of the boys were in trades and industrial jobs , but only a third of these boys had taken any practical arts courses which would have prepared them for the jobs. ? Some of these contradictions , in the opinion of Dr. Smith , are because of misguided reasoning on the part of well-meaning parents . They want their children to have it better than they had it , or " they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spring , prior to graduation , would n't a job-seeking senior like advice ? On such subjects , for example , as to how much money he can make ? ' Would n't they like to know prevailing pay scales even before graduation ? Samuel Beach , Columbia University placement director , is a busy man in the spring answering seniors . Right now he 's saying : the pendulum is swinging in favor of employers . The job outlook is still very good but the total demand for people is down and company representatives are being more selective than last year . " Mr. Beach puts the question of salary in the number four spot when advising seniors on type of work , possibility of advancement , and human relations , but gives the following " going " figures ( for monthly salary ) for Columbia 's graduates : B.S. degrees ( technical subjects ) can start with $350 to $425 a month , non-technical , $300-$375 ; Masters degrees ( technical ) , $350-$525 , non-technical , $325-$ loo . Women graduates ( June , 1954 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if they can find out ) that their  | starting salaries will range between $45 and $65 a week , that there is an increasing need for women to work overseas , that women with good liberal arts backgrounds can , by taking intensive summer training courses , start teaching the following fall at a beginning salary of $3,600 a year ( $4,100 if they have an M.A.9 ) . Engineers are , of course , the winners in these first-off efforts ( in initial salary command ) ? $400 to $500 a month being common . But what are the jobs going to be like ? They also want to know that . And first mistakes can be serious , too . Mr. Beach is forceful on that point . Your first job " is probably the most important one in your career . It 's hard to rectify a poor choice . Employers are suspicious of men willing to throw away years of experience to start all over again . " Television , educators , vocational guidance directors and American industry can put a great service together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an appalling lack in our educational and economic system , and a direct and wasteful avenue to the psychiatrists ! Television and vocational guidance should form a partnership . I wish educators themselves thought more in terms of program need . How can so many of them turn so savagely on television when they so lightly view its biggest problem ? So quickly shun it ? Why do n't educators build vocational guidance shows for television ? In previous pages we saw what use Raymond Wittcoff had for program materials . He had no use for them at all . He seems to feel it is something you can requisition by phone ; that you can send out for it like potato salad , or a pair of theater tickets , or a ready-made suit . His plan ( in which he deeply believes , I have no doubt ) takes no account of the matter of programs at all , and we might expect that if the plan were effectuated under his supervision we would get ( for programs ) the kind of poem Masefield used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : well-laundered but of the wrong sleeve-length and hardly suitable for either wearing or showing . Men and women are moving into TV who respect any " plan " if it has stated responsibility ( that will always be first ) ; and if the   plan is on the track of programs . Why do we need such people ? Because there is an absolutely desperate need of practical programs . Most educators vaguely know this , worry in secret , and do nothing . But in exactly the same way that Dr. John Millis of Western Reserve ( Cleveland ) is a realist on a community scale , so is Dr. Harry K. Newburn , former President of the University of Oregon , a realist on a " network " scale . What Raymond Wittcoff spurned as a " mere program exchange-center , " Dr. Newburn has honored by making it his main labor . He has moved from Portland to Ann Arbor , to head up the first large-scale program operation of its kind so far . Four extraordinary innovations suggest that his digging may find a mother-lode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed jobs for educational television , on a permanent basis . 2 . Though financed by a foundation ( Fund for Advancement of Education ) , the project is unhampered , the Fund not even represented on the board of directors . 3 . A clearing-house and production center is forming . 4 . Millions of feet of film for educational use are being sorted , graded and , if good enough , circulated . This is a great advance . It has real importance . Of course , they 'll screen some terrible reels , but they 'll also uncover some Prizes . And they also plan to " produce . " It is an honest promise that a consolidation of good forces will make sense . There is very little talk of " committees . " Why could n't this have happened in radio ? Clues to the weird thinking that goes on in committees have been available for many years . If you wish to stand on the threshold of marvels , consider what the Education Committee of the National Association of Broadcasters once laid down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must : Be entertaining . Be dramatic . Be of high artistic quality and integrity . Be expressed in correct English and diction . Appeal to the child 's sense of humor .  | Be within the scope of the child 's imagination . Stress human relations for cooperative living . Stress intercultural understanding and appreciation . I was present when this mucid nonsense was being approved , and I challenged all the entries after the first two . This did no good . I was rebuked by the chair , a severe , bloodless fellow who said : " These are the rules , and if intelligently applied , will open new avenues . In all children 's programs we must develop high standards of buying ethics , for the youngsters of today are the nation 's future consumers . " This sentence , if an unusual non-sequitur , was at least grammatical , and served to bring to a close three days of discussion between educators and radio people in Columbus . The last official business of the convention was a motion to censure the 52 juvenile programs then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Far too many get-togethers of educators concerned with radio or television have been about as mindless as the above . This attitude hurt education in radio then ( without hurting radio very much ) , and the same is true today of television . Educators can make sweeping statements of condemnation ; they can drop disparaging remarks of condescension , then walk off the convention 's platform and go home . They can set down commandments they do n't have to live by . ( You 've just read some . ) They can make rules for television that they can themselves disregard . They do n't yet have to put their own rules to the test of production , since they are n't producing anything , merely commenting on the productions of others . They never have to meet a payroll ( a withering responsibility almost never mentioned ) . They seldom write anything likely to be challenged where it can be assessed and ( perhaps ) rejected , they do n't have to think " ahead , " and almost never have to take raps or " sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be caught in those fixed areas of declared responsibility where shows are built . For they do n't build them . This is changing . It is possible to report that things are looking up a little . In some regions ( of thought as well as of geography ) they are looking up quite a little and the intentions and methods of John Millis and Harry K. Newburn are signs of it . Educators seem certain to be more realistic in their approaches  | to television than they ever were in their approaches to radio . It is breaking in this direction . Among some of the other signs that are appearing , the best is this : teachers are becoming set-owners . ( Paul Witty of Northwestern keeps track of this trend in all of his studies . ) True , television is getting much of the same old academic treatment , good and bad , that radio used to get : scrolls , petitions , rebukes , threats from sniffy itinerants with more leisure than objective , dinners with polite sounds from chairmen , plaques , kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing ) . Probably there has been a little posturing on both sides , with attitudes leaning toward the cavalier when they should have leaned toward the cooperative . In the next few pages ? and still reporting the good with the bad ? the reader 's reaction will almost surely incline toward the hopeful side , even though television is still very harshly dealt with by numerous educators , many of them very distinguished indeed . All of them are important or they would n't be quoted . Here is an inventory-taking of the opinions of about twenty wellknown educators from all over the country , on the subject of television . Harvey W. Zorbaugh , mentioned in Chapter 7 , in the opinion of a great many people in commercial radio and television , seems more mentally conditioned to be of practical help to TV than the average university spokesmen . He would appear to be more on the plus side , while such an educator ( to pick a ready example ) as Norman N. Royall , Jr. , of the University of Kansas City would appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You may decide for yourself , and should try to , for his attitude represents that of many like him , a fearsome number , and many of them of great elevation in the university world and the administrative level . In between Mr. Zorbaugh and Dr. Royall there are many choices , with the inevitable contradictions , but with occasional beams of light and tints of humor . Zorbaugh makes a sane suggestion : for the future health of educational TV , instead of assembling " expert witnesses to outtalk each other , " he believes that the Ford Foundation " might pick up the tab for some honest-to-goodness studies . " And we have seen evidence now that Zorbaugh is a good man to lay out some  | honest-to-goodness questions , to go out after some honest answers and bring them in . Dr. Royall ( Liberal Arts ) represents a fixed attitude that is so drained of viable content that you would expect it to die from loss of affection : " Ninety per cent of television is educationally worthless entertainment or advertising . This result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or private subsidy to purchase time on regular stations for educational programs or to construct educational stations in many areas is probably the only solution , but probably will not be achieved . My conclusion is that positive educational value will be trivial for years , or indefinitely . " I have never met this educator , but I think that in this one paragraph we find much of the fear , the hostility , the lack of steam , the attrition , and the pessimism that has poisoned the spring . No educator , it seems to me , could better state his own ineligibility for the coming trials , for he does n't honor the problem , he renounces it . This special form of self-encysting purification can only be found in educated people . Here are some good notices : Paul A. Witty ( a very necessary man for education 's future in TV ) , of Northwestern : " Perhaps the most ominous force at present is the apathy or indifference of many educators to the potentialities of TV . " Reverend Leo McLaughlin , radio director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its implications as the discovery of printing . " Dr. Francis Horn of Johns Hopkins : " Television 's future must be guided by those within the industry in close cooperation with educators . In close cooperation , these groups can make of television the most powerful medium for democracy existing at this time . " Deane W. Malott , President of Cornell : " Educational institutions must not fail to grasp the opportunities the F.C.C. has widely given by reserving TV channels for educational uses . Educators must remember that merely moving the classroom into the home will be repeating the early failures of educational radio . We educators , who have n't yet mastered the techniques of on-campus  | instruction , somehow must not fail with this great instrument of enlightenment . " Millicent McIntosh , Dean of Barnard College : " If both the educators and the commercial broadcasters sincerely seek a common ground , a fairly adequate job can be done over commercial outlets . But a number of educators are giving only lip service to the cause of adult education on TV . " The neatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Professor Charles E. Swanson , of the University of Minnesota : " Whether television is an efficient teacher depends upon who 's teaching , what he 's teaching , and who 's learning . " An interesting contradiction is expressed in the following views . From Mable Newcomer of Vassar : " TV is particularly well adapted to training for responsible citizenship in view of its ability to reach large groups of people . " And from Dr. Clifford Kirkpatrick , of Indiana : " The expensiveness of television as a medium of mass education is a bar to expression of the views of minorities . " These opposite interpretations do n't represent important disagreement , but they do serve to recall the curious self-contradiction , common among almost all the academicians , that Mr. Seldes joyously indulges in his own book , The Great Audience , in which he accuses broadcasters of speaking to " majorities , " then points out how we broadcast mostly to minorities , then resolves this interesting dilemma by characterizing the whole thing as a " massminority medium . " This should put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind may have been in the mind of Roscoe Cate of the University of Oklahoma when he said : " I believe there is some evidence that the intelligence-level of the television audience has been underestimated . " Disagreement is a good thing if those in disagreement are informed , serious , and resilient . But for negativism there is no room in TV , and there should be none in education . Yet negativism has been , thus far , a much too common yield . Here 's a sample . It 's from Professor George A. Clark , Chairman of the Department of Philosophy of Lafayette College : " The total social effect of this wasteful and dangerous toy seems likely to be encouragement of passivity of body and mind when we need to think and act for ourselves . " If that is indeed his attitude , Professor Clark would tremble   to know how many Americans can think and act for themselves well enough to lean forward and make a small clicking sound . The number of Americans who can do this is a figure so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into their chairs of philosophy . Harold Stassen in his hopes for television was polite and quasiexhortatory . He was ebullient but also non-specific . This is a safe position , even a splendid one , for a university president to take ( he was then President of the University of Pennsylvania ) . Here is Stassen in his favorite exercise ? impassioned advocacy of the indeterminate : " The potentialities of education in television are limitless , and greater in attraction than any other form of communication . Every effort should be exerted to make possible and profitable good educational television programming . " This more or less baleful incitement to purity is typical of the " appropriate noises school , " just as the quotes from Professor George Clark and from Norman Royall are typical of the " all is lost " school . Between the extremes of building and destroying , there are many attitudes of interest , many of contrast . From the University of California , vice president Baldwin Woods says : " To be effective , television must be supplemented in many cases by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Lowell , head of Lowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council ( Boston ) : " It is essential that enough channels be reserved throughout the country exclusively for noncommercial educational television stations . " And so , too , Earl J. McGrath , then United States Commissioner of Education ( Washington ) : 10 " The survival and improvement of our democracy depends upon the general enlightenment of the public concerning current problems of national interest . Television can help greatly in spreading that enlightenment . Specific channels throughout the country should be reserved for stations to be owned and operated by educational institutions . " Most of the educators , whether for or against television , are very conscious of the presence of channels and very positive of education 's right to their use . Many educators believe ? and have been widely published for such belief ? that educators should  | have first right to their use . Their desires have everywhere been so pronounced , and their impatience so declamatory , that the public expected something dramatic to happen when the Federal Communications Commission finally made these channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the way the public had expected it to be . All over the United States we had the by-nomeans improving spectacle of educators trampling each other on the way to exits , jettisoning loose diplomas and Peabody Awards . Save us all , nobody wanted a channel ? from here to Portland . Nobody ! Nobody waited for anyone to straighten his baccalaureate . There was some of the drool of panic about it , the grotesquerie of scholastic dishevelment , of cock-eyed laurel , of pedants on the lam . The dreadful stare of toppled statuary . It was a real fiasco and it 's still going on . It was a woman who saw the coming tragedy of this and who sought to prevent it . She was Freda Hennock of the Federal Communications Commission . She knew by experience the procrastination that could be expected when dealing with universities , but with an honest determination to deal with them anyhow she started to talk . By 1952 she had spent better than two years trying to educate educators to a realistic appreciation of their own opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when considering the work she 's in ) , she has held the big stick over entire networks , while beckoning with her free hand for the educators to come on in and get noticeably busy . One of the truly remarkable energies of her sex and generat ion , she 's the best friend the educators have ever had , and they 've let her down . Or so it seems to me . True , some universities will make an effort ( many are doing so now ) , some of these efforts will succeed , and some of these advances will be large , and permanent too . The Chairman of the FCC at that time , Paul Walker , had a sharp fear , though , that many educators , when it came to the formal filing of applications for channel assignment , might hold back . ( The same fear Miss Hennock had ) . To give educators every break possible ? and no one has ever quarreled actively with them  | ? he made talks on the air and personally traveled all over the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't processed by July 1st , reallocation of any of the channels could be made in June 1953 ( a year after the setaside order , published in the Federal Register ) . Educators could thus lose ( by clerical default ) the position they had wanted for so long in TV . That was his warning and this victory was within their grasp . It is not possible to be any clearer than Chairman Walker was in his plea to educational groups throughout America : " This is American education 's year of decision . What you do this year may determine for a long , long time ? perhaps for generations ? the role of education in television . The time to act is now . If television does not have No. 1 priority on your agenda from now on , then the end of this fateful year may see educational television a lost cause . " What happened has been a disappointment to the really serious people in and around universities ; and the really serious element in the lay public ; and the serious workmen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education sensibly adjusted to each other . But it was not an unexpected disappointment to television people . They were n't even surprised . Television was quite sure that educators , when given the chance , would not do much ; that the size of the challenge would scare them ; that the intricacy of the " toy " was beyond them ; that they would be overwhelmed not by the chance when given it , but by their total lack of ability to use and enjoy the inheritance when it came to them . It is my own belief that they have themselves secretly suspected this from the beginning . Most of the educators in this country are superior men and women who do a great piece of work , do it throughout their lives with little thanks , little reward , little notice . They pay professional attention to their own labor , and so honor it . They get very poor pay for it . But these are not the people who represent education to television . Neither are the presidents of the universities the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even then , only occasionally ? to the press . The direct contacts with television come from a group that represents probably less than two percent of the total teaching   profession . They almost always have but one purpose . It is selfadvantage . It is never public service . They either want something for themselves , or for their university ; never for the broad benefit of American multitudes . And they want it right away , then want it for nothing , and when you ask flatly what it is they do want , they always mention the same three things : culture , the art museum , and the university library . They always want to " give " television these opportunities . TV already has them . They do n't want to do good . They want to take credit . They do n't want to learn . They want to exploit . They do n't even want to teach . Here is the saddest part of all : America 's greatest teachers have never been in communication on a direct and practical basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most good , give their thoughts the benefit of careful review , save them the most trouble . All that the networks ever see are the promoters . These range from bullies and windy floaters to the mincing , the meeching , the starry-eyed , or the obsequious . Citizens ' committees , listeners ' committees , TV-viewer-delegations from national women 's clubs and organizations , Aroused Committees for Better Programs , university committees of logistic resourcefulness and heavy backing , Committees to Save Our Children , yipping or cluck-clucking , depending on their age and chemistry ? all of them have been coming to the big cities all over America for a number of years , banging on doors , then going back to their own towns and clubs and parishes with two major reports and reactions ? the first . " Fellow members , you will be glad to hear that we sure told the networks where to get off ! " Or the second : " They just wasted our time . Kept sending us from one person to another . Nobody would even read our resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational groups that they have been given a polite , or even an impolite , interoffice run-around , but it reflects no cynicism on the networks . Radio people and television people know more about these committees than the committees do . The committeeman knows his own committee , and no more . The networks know many hundreds " If you want to lose control of something , give it to a committee . II you want to lose it forever , give it to a big committee ! " Any radio or television professional knows this is true , knows that  | time is wasting if he finds himself in the presence of a committee , for he knows he 's in the presence of amateurs . Why did n't the teachers teach ? Probably , because the idea was so simple . But the right teachers never got to the microphones . Too many well-intentioned ambassadors got to the program departments , without programs . There simplicity died under the trucks of talk . Amateurism and self-interest ? never public interest ? ruined education 's chances with radio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have seen how it works . Education is trying hard to avoid an even more disastrous fumble in television . It may , too , though it currently has some clumsy players skidding around on a wet field . On the other hand , there are more than a few realists and there 's an increasing supply of alerted brainpower in top administrative positions , men and women honestly concerned with the problem of using TV and using it well . Cornell 's president . who was quoted earlier , understands what should be done . Clearly and bluntly he understands it . The problem is understood , too , by Dr. Francis Horn of Johns Hopkins , also mentioned . Johns Hopkins puts on a show every Monday night ( " Science Review " ) that is crammed with ingenuity , imagination , and excitement . This is much more than a promising sign . This is a large-scale present day accomplishment . It may some day attract sponsorship , abhorrent though that word will be to the purists . Something else that will help education in its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this joint objective ( and these suggestions will be too repugnant to bear ) : disband all the committees and work with never more than three people . Aim deliberately for sponsorship . Aiming for sponsorship ? not necessarily securing it , just aiming for it ? will immediately clear out most of the cheerful mounte banks who have been sidelining and hand-signalling this little contest since 1930 . And it should also stop most of those glib commuters who are now riding university payrolls on nothing more noble than cheap and cynical career-chivies . The purists claim that even when they have something good they can never get a fair hearing with responsible people in tele ?   vision . This is not true , and here 's the reason why . This is a brief run-down on a show called " What In The World . " This show originates in Philadelphia and feeds the CBS-TV network each Sunday afternoon for a half-hour . What you will see now is an office memo and it is recorded here because it reveals two things of great importance : first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television people do about them . Here 's the report : " This is a remarkable half-hour weekly sustainer , of real and fascinating educational force , so much so that it will eventually secure sponsorship . Idea is simple . The presiding emcee , Dr. Ramsey , a good looking , intelligent , and very easy ad libber , places objects of cultural and/or archaeological interest on tabletop , in the presence of three famous experts ? botanists , anthropologists , excavators , explorers , etc. ? fellows who really know their stiff about the history of man , his artifacts , etc . Sample show included Dr. Carleton S. Coon , head of Department of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania , author of Caravan ' and world 's greatest expert on Persia ; Dr. Ralph Linton , head of the Department of Anthropology at Yale , world 's greatest expert on Madagascar and the Pacific Islands , author of The Study of Man ' ; Dr. Alfred Kitter , expert on American Indians , particularly South and Central . " Objects put before these men are from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these experts or , indeed , by anyone . They have not yet been put on display . Objects vary from masks for social dancing in southern Alaska to jewel-spitting mongooses from Ceylon , and flint hand-axes from the valley of the Thames half a million years ago . The men are invited to identify what they are looking at , as to its age , use , origin , etc . Mostly they are incredibly accurate . Their conversation is easygoing , their own enthusiasm is large and contagious . When they ire through guessing , Dr. Ramsey , the emcee , reads the statement on the University card catalog . Often the experts are so erudite In their own judgments that they disagree with the statements in the catalog . They are not jealous or fussy in their knowledge but sist on exactness .   " With the possible exception of the uses to which TV put Roy K. Marshall , this is probably the next best way to exploit for **30;1369;TOOLONG some of the wisdom of America 's universities . " The above report is routine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of an advertising agency to keep the office and its clients informed on what is new and what is good , what 's good about it , and how much it costs . And the second item : the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania did not think up this show , nor did anybody in the University . Robert Forrest , a crack TV producer and a staff man at WCAU-TV , thought it all up , did the digging , and got it going . He , not the University , thought it was exciting and planned it first . It 's never the university . Through the long years , this has always been the way it goes ; always the man , never the university . Is it changing ? Yes ? it is . Quite suddenly . And it may get big .   IT IS OFTEN HARD TO RECONCILE THE ATTITUDES OF CRITICS WITH their words and purposes . If Robert Hutchins , for example , suggested that a certain amount of cash reserve , self-replenishing if possible , were an aid to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational philosophy would fall down . Russell Conwell recommended riches for all , without any nonsense about how to use your leisure once you had it . Just get the money . The necessity for being able to afford your own private thinking was recorded some years prior to both Mr. Hutchins and Mr. Conwell , and translated , reads something like this : " A good income is a desirable adjunct to an intellectual life . " It was Aristotle who said this , the problem apparently being fairly standard even then . We are more likely to remember , as Americans , that the Venus de Milo had a 28-inch waistline than that Aristotle had money worries . A dedicated disregard for the economics of radio and television ( they are very expensive ) is usually seen in areas where there is ii risk . So , as we saw in the first chapter , Professor Frederick Gruber of the University of Pennsylvania can imply a deep rebuke ? I suppose the rebuke is to " rank commercialism " ? when he writes : " Procter and and Gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public will hear than any other single organization in America . " What of it ? They bought the time . Are they guilty of something for using it ? What , exactly , is reprehensible here ? What does Jack Gould know or even care about the economics of television ? In late October , 1952 , in a widely read and quoted piece in the New York Sunday Times ( " The Low State of TV " ) , he scolds sponsors , networks , and businessmen this way : " Television must take heed . . . . The sponsors ' only security for the days ahead lies in bold recognition that if television is to retain its vigor as an advertising form , they themselves must live excitingly . Gentlemen , wake up ! Out with artiness and the academic approach ; let 's talk business ! What 's happening to television is a slow paralysis of its living organs . . . . Bring on the plays that have something to say and are not afraid to take a stand . Give the writers a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal situation was created for a writer to work unmolested in television , and without any doubt at all , the ideal writer was given the spot . He was Robert E. Sherwood , four times a winner of the Pulitzer Prize . His credits , which have long established him as this nation 's most important playwright , include " The Road to Rome , " " The Queen 's Husband , " " Waterloo Bridge , " " This Is New York , " " Reunion in Vienna , " " Acropolis , " " The Petrified Forest , " " Idiot 's Delight , " " Abe Lincoln in Illinois , " " There Shall Be No Night , " and " The Rugged Path . " He wrote the book for " Miss Liberty , " and he wrote a history of permanent value called Roosevelt and Hopkins . I 've met Mr. Sherwood a few times . He 's one of the most creative Americans alive . And though he is profoundly purposeful he is also richly humorous , not only in his writing but sympathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furthermore , a great humanitarian , and a recognizer of humanitarianism in others . He has the pity and indignation of Galsworthy , and twice the stagecraft . Tiny clues can light up whole areas for this man , and an example of it ( I believe he comments on it in the foreword to " Abe Lincoln in Illinois " ) is his quick recognition of the unconscious pathos ? almost unbearable to Sherwood today , a full century from the time delivered ? in Lincoln 's farewell to all his friends at the lift le station in Springfield : " . . . and not knowing when , or whether  | ever , I may return . . . . " This phrase haunted Sherwood , as it would any man sensitive to loneliness , to the isolation of greatness . f mention it only to point to a quality in Sherwood the playwright , not to any quality in Lincoln , who returned as a corpse . Robert Sherwood wrote a play for television . I am not going to make any critical comment on the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics and columnists were on the whole so savage , and Jack Gould was himself so merciless , that I would not have been surprised if Sherwood , on reading what was written about his first appearance in this medium , had asked NBC to relieve him of the remaining obligations in his contract . It is nice to be able to report this did not happen . It was almost as if the television critics were waiting for Sherwood in order to destroy him . No critic considered the psychic thrust he might have been making upon this man , and in the case of Sherwood , some such consideration might have had merit . It might have preserved Sherwood 's interest . He 's never worked that side of the street before . As a writer for the theater his first play was seen in New York in 1927 . His productions average out from that date at about one every two years . They get special attention when they appear . They enjoy isolated treatment , even though it may be brief . But in television you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bet Your Life " and " Dragnet , " and bucking the Lone Ranger on one channel and Arthur Godfrey on another . You are indeed in a maelstrom . The network might have helped Mr. Sherwood through much of this if they had told him that the " American story , " for the time being , had been told too often , told to the point of saturation ; that America had been " discovered " on every network for so many years that the subject , in terms of the public 's capacity to receive and react to new impressions , was worn out ; that regular viewers ? which is to say most of us ? needed a chance to rest up again . The Sherwood effort was hurt seriously ( I think ) by a whole rash f " American stories " on television the very week his own production occurred ; and for him , at least , the most injurious among twin was produced only two nights before his , telling almost identically the same story as his own . The network could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might at least have given him a reading of the week 's menu . His theme had become invisible when his version of it appeared . It was just another bean in the dish . Sherwood did n't put together a work of art ( and did n't try to ) , but do television critics think this playwright is going to retire from the tank because he took a flat dive the first time off a new board ? Or do they think his talent has now evaporated through fear of what was said of him ? Do they think they have shut him up ? Or dried him up ? Do they think he can be hereafter disregarded as a writer because they 've decided to scold him ? Hemingway wrote Across the River and into the Trees ? probably something less than a work of art . Thomas Mann 's Black Swan just laid an egg . What 's new about any of this ? Who 's excited ? Many of the comments I examined on the Sherwood matter were spattered with the spore of artistic vandalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reviews were mordant and sneering and predatory , some of them almost comically so , as if public betrayal on a religious scale had been committed . Some read like cartoon balloons from a Sunday strip of rearguard Fearless Fosdicks . And looked like glimpses into " esprit de Buchenwald . " Their comments did n't silence a great writer . No critic ever did that , not even a good one . But they might have turned him away from a medium he could greatly honor , a medium he was then facing for the first time . He might have quit in disgust . It is possible that television does n't deserve the attentions of Robert Sherwood , and that it does deserve its critics . The quality of criticism he received here would justify his turning his back on the field . What " they " did to Sherwood is fatuous in still one more way : they did n't strip him of his talents . They did n't even disarrange them . Talents are n't a man 's clothes . They 're the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he alone . Criticism has a higher function than scolding , even in television . No critic , in the Sherwood case , had the curiosity even to wonder what kind of reception the public gave his offering . It was , as it so tiringly has been for so long , the " cultivated minority " speaking of , to , and for itself .   Lyman Bryson long ago noted the average radio critic 's inability to fulfil his own function , largely through his inability to understand what his function is . He said something in 1951 , about broadcasting , that applies to what Professor Gruber has said about Procter &; Gamble in radio , and also to what has happened in the television criticism which the Sherwood show attracted : " Broadcasting judged by high standards is wasteful . Printing judged by the same standards is more so . The point of this is that the differences between popular taste and cultivated taste are much the same in all the arts that have been amplified by mechanical processes . " There are several difficulties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inexpugnable illusion of people of developed taste that they know what the public wants . I am quite ready to admit that the commercial broadcaster also does not know what the public wants . The field is littered with costly mistakes . The point is that his mistakes do cost him money . He does his guessing with the benefit of market research , which is quantitatively indicative , and is not trusted as anything else . He works in a system of lethal competitiveness where most scholars could not breathe . IIe makes his guesses in the teeth of his rivals , not before a silent and subservient class or his admiring colleagues . He frequently goes wrong . But it seems a little irrational to suppose that he is always wrong on the main point , and that the intelligentsia with not even their reputations at stake , are always right . " Later on in the same essay he remarks : " It is not important to defend the broadcasters against the intellectuals . The shoe is on the other foot . When are the intellectuals going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to know something about broadcasting as a combination of new arts , to listen seriously , and to help create serious criticism . . . . The newspapers and some of the weeklies have radio columns made up mostly of gossip . There are a few good professional critics of broadcasting ; but they often retreat into satire because they know that there is practically no public that is as much interested in reading a sober and searching criticism of a broadcast of any kind as there is for any second-rate concert or third-rate book or fourth-rate comedy .   " The challenge to members of the cultivated minority that broadcasting offers is that they shall take the trouble ? some of them at least , while the others wait ? to find out what is on the air and then to criticize it not mercifully but intelligently , and with the slowly acquired expertness that makes criticism valuable . " This will not change all broadcast programs , now or ever , into what the critics want , any more than reviews and comments on books diminish or improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will sustain and encourage the artists and producers in radio who are moved by the same desires as move the makers of great things in print or elsewhere . " 1 Moving from the warm candor of Mr. Bryson to a field a bit more commercial , Maurice Mitchell , Muzak 's former general manager , has found the " culture belt " abhorrent in many ways . There are suggestions that it is non-existent even to itself . He recreates the typical complaint of the station-owner : 2 " Sure , I 'm afraid I 'll lose my license . . . so I start loading up with all this cultural stuff . The trouble is , the only people who want it are the crack-pots who threatened me ? and even they do n't listen to it . Too busy trying to uplift everybody else . . . . Year after year . . . the public does not look to radio for more of the kinds of programs its critics say it should feature . The facts show that the people do n't want them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Sometimes he wonders whether there should n't be another ' freedom ' added to the list of new ones we 've lately discovered : freedom from culture . . . . I have often heard radio men remark that our enemies can do no more effective piece of damage to this nation 's readiness and vitality than to jam our radio stations ? not electronically from outside as they do with the Voice of America ? but culturally from within , by simply loading program schedules with ' helpful educational talks and discussions . ' " Mr. Bryson and Mr. Mitchell are finding the same truth in very independent ways , and both address indiscriminate audiences of Americans all the time . It can be dangerous to deal superficially with workmen of   proven accomplishment . In thinking about this ( and about Sherwood , and the aftermath of criticism ) , some of the appalling selflove and the narcissistic fixity that finally destroyed Virginia Woolf is present in many entries in her published Diary . This , for example , is the way it made Virginia Woolf feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other artists , the works of some of whom will surely survive her own : " I think myself infallible . Have n't I recently dismissed John Middleton Murry 's play , and exactly appraised K 's Katherine Mansfield 's story , and summed up Aldous Huxley ? " ( You can see her dusting off her hands . ) Had she indeed " exactly " done so ? Perhaps , but if so , what then ? Could it not also be argued that she became badly caught iii her own conceit , at least badly enough to drown herself ? It is a greater loss to the world ? with thirty productive years ahead of him ? if Sherwood wo n't write for television , than that Virginia Woolf gave up writing and living . Critically she was better treated , though artistically far less versatile than Sherwood . And she did n't give a damn for the world , even though her own critical perceptions were here and there marked by sympathy . It 's too bad Mrs. Woolf is dead but it was her doing , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's shameful . He 's around , and working . Who 's gunning for him , anyhow ? And why ? In radio and television , and pretty generally throughout the advertising world , there are a few misconceptions that have their special durability . One of the most lingering is this : " He the idea man has a million ideas a minute . Ninety percent of them are crazy , but every once in a while , he 's got a world-beater . " I would like to say that there is no such person . The so-called idea man with a million-a-minute is crazy not 90 but 100 percent of the time . All of his ideas are bad , every one of them . I know a great many of these men . They are lightweights and thimbleriggers . If the real idea man has one or two a year he is extremely valuable . One or two in a lifetime is about par . If Robert Sherwood had paid attention to the critics who tried to take his skin off he would not now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murrow were sensitive to what is said of him ( and he is not loved everywhere ) , a great idea might not have been revealed .
