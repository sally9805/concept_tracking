txt The United States Weather Bureau , charged with a. gravel responsibility in terms of life , property and commercial interest , is severely handicapped by a lack of funds to carry out al ' complex operation . As a case in point , meteorologists say that if the trend toward eliminating weather observation stations continues there is a very real danger that the bureau 's forecasts will become less accurate . In 1947 there were 443 such Weather stations . Next year there will be 321 . In 1949 the Weather Bureau had 4,517 full-time employes . Next year there will be 3,728 . The plight of the Weather Bureau was brought into focus by Hurricane Carol , which roared into an unprepared New England at the end of . ugust , killing sixty persons and causing damage estimated at $500,000,000 . As a result of that storm this newspaper interviewed about forty persons in the field of weather study and prediction , most of them privately employed and thus holding no special brief for the Weather Bureau . To a man they agreed that the bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Budget and that , consequently , its product was not up to what it could be . One description characterized the Weather Bureau as a neglected " horse - and - buggy outfit struggling to get along on just a pittance a fraction of the money it should have . " The more generously inclined commented that in spite of severe budgetary handicaps the Weather Bureau through constant struggle was " almost " managing to keep abreast of the times in a branch of science that was said to be much more complex than such a notably difficult field as the development of the hydrogen bomb . All of those surveyed agreed that the Weather Bureau , with only a token amount available for research , was not able to take the lead in attempting to solve the knotty problems in weather prediction . Such an accelerated research program does not necessarily hold out the key that will enable the Weather Bureau by next year or the year after that to warn us with certainty that a hurricane like Carol will strike a specific area at a specific time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that unless such research is done now , in ten and twenty years from now other Carols will still be roaring in from the sea , violently and unexpectedly . And again there will be the consequent tragedy of lives snuffed out , homes and life-long possessions destroyed and business establishments , built up through a lifetime , wrecked without hope of repair . Government bureaus have seldom been notable for economy of operation . Apparently the Weather Bureau is exceptional in this respect . A committee of private citizens , expert in the field , was appointed last year by the Secretary of Commerce to study the Weather Bureau and its functions . That committee 's report said : " A review of the history of the Weather Bureau 's budget has impressed the committee with the frugality of this bureau 's operation and its management is to be commended for the manner which they have administered public funds . We know of no other governmental agency that has been so economical in the expenditure of its funds . " Comparatively Low Expenditure The committee went on to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capita a year for a weather service , while the Soviet Union spent 47 cents ( last available figure ten years ago ) and England spent 20 cents , the United States , with a gross income far higher than any of these countries , was allottine ' each year only 18 cents per capita for its Weather Bureau . Yet , quite literally , billions of dollars are at stake in the United States as a result of the foibles of the weather . It is not only a question of whether a lawn party can be held or a ball game will be played  --  the sort of thing that many associate with the Weatherman . A merchant fleet unwarned of ! the approach of a storm can be wiped out overnight . A crop of oranges can be destroyed by a cold snap . Hundreds of persons can be killed in a tornado when a scant ten-minute warning might save them all . It was for this reason that the Secretary of Commerce 's committee , headed by Brig . Gen. Joseph J. George , Superintendent of Meteorology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau receive the strongestnossible support in budgetary matters at the department level for the next few years when adequate funds will be absolutely essential . " In spite of the fact that this recommendation was made last December Congress appropriated only $24,750,000 for the Weather Bureau this year , a figure well under the $27,250,000 allotted for the bureau 's high year , fiscal 1953 . Shortcomings of Service But these bare figures do not tell the story . As a science , meteorology has exacting demands . Talented and trained personnel are required to tackle the tough job of weather analysis and prediction . Such personnel are not being attracted by the meager salaries that the bureau is forced to pay . Similarly , research . the life-blood of science , is getting scant support from the bureau . Another result of the continual cutting of the bureau 's budget is that the amount of data upon which the forecaster must depend to make his predictions is becoming less each year as additional weather stations are closed . That trend , of course , is very dangerous . The bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should be in the weather stations is not being acquired . A good case in point is the matter of radar sets . A new radar set iss prohibitively priced ( as far as the Weather Bureau is concerned ) at something over $200,000 . Fortunately , the Navy gave the Weather Bureau a hundred old radar sets . But even the money to convert this equipment  --  about $10,000 a set  --  was not available . With some financial sacrifice . ' four of the sets were installed 1 ! along the Atlantic seaboard to I watch hurricanes and other severe storms . ( It is generally agreed that about fourteen are needed to track storms adequately along the East Coast . ) The other sets were offered to communities willing to pay the price of converting the equipment . Several cities in Texas , plagued by tornadoes , assumed Ithe financial responsibility and a few of the sets were installed there . However , there are many other cities and weather stations that could profitably use the equipment , which now lies gathering dust in a warehouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar in weather detection lies in the Air Defense Command . i This command has an excellent radar net and it is perfectly willing to cooperate in every way with the Weather Bureau . But reading radar in connection with the weather is difficult . For example , rain squall lines appear on the scope in such a way that they seem to indicate the presence of the eye of a hurricane . Such a false reading can be misleading to a disastrous degree . To do this difficult job accurately , the Weather Bureau should post a man either at the air defense command 's radar machines or at least at the radar report filter center . But , lacking this personnel , these centers remain uncovered by the Weather Bureau and the radar reports that finally get to the Weather Bureau from the Air Defense Command 's radar net are late , incomplete and possibly misleading , Left in the Lap of Congress As a result of all these factors , the weather experts in the field agree , the reountry is not getting the kind and quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be lost unnecessarily and millions of dollars of preventable damage may ' be done . This year , as in the years before , the Department of Commerce will urge on the Bureau of the Budget and the Congress an increased appropriation for the Weather Bureau . Until now the pleas met with no success . The bureau , it seems , always loses " the Battle on the Hill . " If the weather experts could go to Congress and say : " Give us more money and we guarantee that next year there will be no more Carols striking the coast without warning , " the bureau would undoubtedly get an adequate appropriation . But in the difficult science of meteorology no such guarantee can be made . Progress comes only slowly and the results can not be assured in advance . It is certain , however , the meteorologists agree , that unless : an attempt is made to improve the situation , everything will remain as it is at present . The weatherman will continue to be the butt of jokes and the nation will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weather . This is the first of three arIticles on the Weather Bureau land weather forecasting .
