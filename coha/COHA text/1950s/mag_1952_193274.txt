Republicans from 26 counties held a convention at Hays , Kans. last week to name the Sixth Congressional District 's delegates to the national convention . The Sixth is the home territory of Senator Frank Carlson , executive director of the Eisenhower-for-President campaign ( he represented the district in Congress for twelve years ) . But 75 of the 157 delegates to the district convention came to Hays pledged to vote for Taft men . Carlson 's home county , Cloud , sent two delegations . Disgruntled Taft men had stalked out of the county convention , which was pro-Eisenhower , and named their own rump delegation . <P> Without the nine delegates from Cloud , the Taft men had a 75-73 majority . Result : the convention quickly voted to seat the Taft delegation . That gave the Taft supporters a working majority for the rest of the day 's business . Result : two Taft men were elected as the district 's delegates to the national convention , and a third was recommended to the state convention , for delegate-at-large . <P> Taft men had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national convention delation from Kansas , Ike 's home state . Their victory at Hays , in Ikeman Carlson 's own bailiwick , did not portend a Taft sweep of the Kansas delegation , but it was a sharp illustration of what politicians mean when they say the Taft campaign is " organized .
