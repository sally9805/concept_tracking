To the Chicago Tribune 's Jules Dubois , it was pretty much the same old story : in nearly 30 years as a correspondent covering the political turmoil of Latin America , he had been mauled by Peronista hoodlums in Argentina , threatened by Panamanians , and beaten by Communist thugs in Guatemala . Last week he seemed about to be torn to bits by one of Fidel Castro 's Havana mobs . <P> Dubois , 49 , had been quite a while in earning the hatred of the Cuban mob . Among U.S. correspondents covering Castro , few had written more warmly during the early days of the revolutionary regime ( Castro , reported Dubois , " has a deep reverence for civilian , representative , constitutional government " ) . But the longer Castro ruled , the more critical became Dubois , and Castro 's Cuba lashed furiously back at him . Last September the National Federation of Gastronomic Workers ordered Havana waiters not to serve Dubois food or drink . Dubois took the ineffectual embargo ( lifted after four weeks ) in stride . Scoffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next , barbers in Pinar del Rio province refused to cut Dubois 's hair . That did not bother him ; he has n't much hair anyhow . <P> But then the campaign against Dubois began losing its comic aspects . Several weeks ago Havana 's Radio Mambi started carrying , at 15-minute intervals , pleas for loyal Cubans to contribute their centavos to buy a huge bucket for Dubois to soak his head in . Anti-Dubois signs appeared on shop fronts on the Prado , Havana 's main street . The press , especially the Communist daily Hoy , began denouncing Jules Dubois as a spy . <P> With that sort of talk , it could not be long before the Havana mob went after Dubois . Last week , as he sat writing a story in the downtown office of the American Cable &; Radio Co. , the throng appeared . Came the chant : " Do we want Fidel ? " The answer : " Yes ! " The question : " Do we want Dubois ? " The answer : " No ! To the firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was picked up by a military guard , led through the howling , spitting mob to a taxi and safety at the Havana Hilton Hotel . Back in his room , Dubois made light of the danger . Said he : " Tell the boys at home not to worry . " <P> But the boys at home were worried . Next day came the announcement that the Tribune was pulling Dubois out of Cuba for a while . At the airport to see him off were the predictable hoodlums , shouting obscenities . There were also a few friends . " Do n't worry , " Jules Dubois told them , " I 'll be back . " Until he returns , his place will be filled by the Tribune 's aviation editor , Wayne Thomis , who has never been to Cuba and has therefore made no Cuban enemies .
