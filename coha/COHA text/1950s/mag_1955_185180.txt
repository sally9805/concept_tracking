Already committed to enter the Minnesota presidential primary next March 20 , Adlai Stevenson last week announced plans to run in at least four more states : Illinois on April 10 , Pennsylvania on April 24 , Florida on May 29 , and California on June 5 . Said Stevenson : " These primaries were selected to provide for expressions of preference on a regional basis in the East , Midwest , South and West . " <P> But Stevenson took more than the compass into account in picking his spots : he also made shrewd use of the political barometer . His choice of primaries offers a minimum of risk , yet gives him a chance to satisfy demands that he test himself at the polls . In Minnesota , he will have the almost unbeatable organization of Senator Hubert Humphrey going all-out for him ; on his home ground in Illinois , he will be a favorite son ; in Pennsylvania , the primary is made to order for organization control , and Stevenson has in his corner every state leader , including Governor George Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson Dilworth . <P> Thus , only Florida and California hold a chance for an upset-and they , not much . Florida 's popular Governor LeRoy Collins leans toward Stevenson , and the state 's anti-Collins faction is led by ex-Governor Fuller Warren , a hater of Estes Kefauver from the days of the Kefauver investigating committee . Kefauver has kept up his Miami contacts , and some observers believe he can still carry that city ; elsewhere in Florida his star has dimmed . In California , Stevenson has already lined up nearly all Democratic leaders , including most of those who supported Kefauver in 1952 . <P> In announcing his plans , Stevenson made clear that he had " reached no final decision at this time regarding possible entry into other state primaries . " In some states he would have little choice , e.g. , Oregon , which permits a candidate 's name to be entered without his consent . <P> Stevenson will also be under heavy pressure-mostly from those who wish him no good-to enter other primaries , especially the prestige-packed Wisconsin race . On the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes two weeks before the April 3 Wisconsin primary , Stevenson hopes to stay clear of Wisconsin . For this , he has good cause : a survey recently turned over to him by a supporter , former U.S. Representative Andrew Biemiller , indicates that Estes Kefauver might very well beat Stevenson in Wisconsin .
