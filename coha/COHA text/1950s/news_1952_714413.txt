txt Feuding between Presidential campaign forces of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio and General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , even as spokesmen for each warned against verbal barbs that might carry seeds of party disunity , overshadowed business sessions of the Republican National , Committee today . The growing bitterness , though irked outwardly with smiles , acame evident when Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . of Massachusetts , national campaign manager for General Eisenhower , drafted last-minute inserts for a pro-Eisenhower speech at a luncheon session so as to answer acid remarks cast in the general 's direction in an address last night by David S. Ingalls , the Taft manager . The Senator demanded that rival campaigners not " take cracks at each other now which will endanger cooperation " after the nominating convention . He also spoke in disapproval of " sly digs " and use of phrases such as " glamour , " one of those employed by Mr. Ingalls in what was generally interpreted as a slap at the Eisenhower candidacy . Applause From Accused Mr. Ingalls , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had cautioned against letting deliate become SO acrimonious as to threaten a party split , smilingly applauded the Senator 's critical remarks of response And pronounced it " a good speech . " Meanwhile , Eisenhower headquarters declared that messages re-. ceived during the day showed that ' the Ingalls talk was boomeranging against the Taft candidacy . Other developments in connection with sessions of the national committee , which is laying plans for the Republican National Convention opening in Chicago , July 7 , included these : I. J. Russel Sprague , National Committeeman of New York , and the Nassau County Executive , lost a fight to increase the allotment of convention delegates from a tentative ninety-six to 100 , for his state , as the committee based its delegate distribution among the states upon the 1950 census . The Chicago convention will have 1,205 delegates , 111 more than at the 1948 session , and a majority vote of 603 will be necessary to nominate the Republican standard bearer . 2 . Harold E. Stamen , former Governor of Minnesota , offered the committee his own blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smiie , " chided victory claims of the Taft forces though he mentioned neither Senator Taft nor General Eisenhower by name . 3 . The national committee approved the setting up of a kind of " grass roots " advisory group composed of four Republican state chairmen , one - to be selected in each of four regions , the East , South , Rocky Mountain-Central and Far West . The question of campaign finances was discussed in executive session . Candidate Voices Views The Stassen speech tonight was I the last of four made before the national committee by or fort avowed or available candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination and Mr. Stassen declared this meeting actually opened the nomination campaign . In the only one of the four broadcast nationally Senator Lodge , speaking in behalf of General Eisenhower , warned that there were not enough registered Republicans in the country to elect a President even if all of them voted for the Republican nominee . He added that a majority of young persons - leaned toward the Democratic party . Surveys showed , however , that " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Eisenhower and he insisted that the general 's popularity generally was " not merely overwhelming , it ' a without precedent in history . " " If Dwight Eisenhower 's extraordinary hold on the American people were solely due tit the fact ( that be has a warm personality and i magnetic bearing , " Senator Lodee ? Went on , " we might have justifiable reservations about supporting him - in spite of his immense popularity . " But his hold on American opinion can not , I think , be attributed to these personal traits  --  to what was described here last night as glamour , to use only one of the phrases employed . " Senator Defines " Good Poll " On the subject of polls , Senator Lodge said , he had been told that " my distinguished friend from Ohio , Mr. Ingalls , " had , announced the results of a poll taken by a newspaper " friendly to his date . " , " But last night , " he added , " I was much impressed , in fact , I was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warnings against all polls . I suppose that the only good poll is the , one favorable to one 's own side . " Saying he would be the first to agree that polls were not  --  a perfect test , Mr. Lodge , in an obvious reply to the Taft forces ' argument that Senator Taft had never lost an election , added : " Neither  --  let me add  --  is a state election ( a perfect test ) . American history is full of men who were big vote getters for statewide office , but could not make the grade nationally . " That the Senator might be including Gov . Earl Warren of Californit in this ' assertion was doubted generally , since he paid tribute to Mr. Warren as having done a service to the Republican  --  party in his speech to the committee yesterday . Stassen Sifts Taft Claims Mr. Stassen referred to " the political atmosphere ? in which speak " and stressed , with Taft claims evidently in mind , " that the nomination of one candidate is now ' certain , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control delegates ' without reference to the people have been made , that ' this nomination will mean election because ' any real Republican can , win . ' " " In other words , " he asserted , , " the Presidency is already zippered Up in a plush-lined bag waiting only for the . opening of the zipper by expert hands six months hence . " I am inclined to the belief that it will soon ' be found . that the plush-lined bag has not been zippered shut and that the help of a majority of voters in primaries is necessary before it can be closed . " In an obvious reference to ? the Eisenhower movement Mr. Stassen asserted that there was another school - of thought that believed " that all the traditional pre-convention ' speeches and conferences of candidates are of no account , that nothing important will happen until Chicago six months from now when the khaki curtain will roll back and the next President will take his bow . " ? The big audience cheered and applauded the name of General of the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared that ? " one of the first things I would do aS it Republican President would be to wipe out the tragic record ofehis terrible summary dismissal , call him to the White House and properly decorate him for his great service to America . " Mr. Stassen assailed President Truman and , with a verbal bow to his own rivals , said Governor Warren , Senator Taft and General Eisenhower each would make . al " far , far better President than the present incumbent of the White House . " New York Delegation Cut New York 's defeat in its drive for a larger convention delegation than had been allotted came at a session of the Committee on Convention Call . New York had ninetyseven delegates at the 1048 convention when the state had fortyfive Congressional districts . From each of these two delegates were elected , and there were seven delegates at large . The districts now have been cut to forty-three as a result of the 1950 census , but there is no machinery available at this time for delegate elections in forty-three , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he argued that , anyhow , the rules adopted at Philadelphia supported his arguments for the number of delegates he sought . He was voted down by the committee members after Harrison E. Spangler of Iowa , acting counsel for the committee , had argued fOr the allocation as tentatively drawn under the 1950 census figures . In. order to meet the peculiar situation in New York , it was agreed that the state would elect ninety district delegates , two from each of the old ( and existing ) forty-five Congressional Districts , and that it would elect six , instead of ten , delegates-at-large . Four years hence , of course , with the New York reapportionment then fully effective and the machinery set up in the new districts , the delegate elections will be held In forty-three , not forty-five districts . Mr. Sprague did not appeal the committee action to the full National Committee , saying that " a record had to be made and somebody had to make it . " The Eisenhower headquarters here disillayed elation on two counts today . In happily charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenbower 's behalf cited a telegram received by Senator Lodge from Theodore S. Ryan of Sharon , Conn. who described himself as " a member of the Connecticut Republican finance committee trying to ' keep an open mind . " Mentioning that he had seen and heard quotations from Mr. Ingalls ' speech , he wired that he was advising the Taft manager that " you have cheapened yourself and your candidate in my estimation and have done- a disservice to the Republican party ; I hope you keep ) the campaign on a higher level . " The Louisiana primary . results showing Eisenhower supporters winning ten of twelve contested seats on the state 's Republican ' , Central Committee and John Jackson , national committeeman , failing to win in Orleans Parish with the Eisenhower supporters winning substantially , was the second realson for elation among Senator Lodge and his colleagues . Mr. Lodge sent a congratulatory message to John Minor . Wisdom , New Orleans attorney and Eisenhower leader , saying : " You 've done a magnificent job . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
