txt Bradley and Johnson . Hear on Asian Security Commander in Tokyo Said to Urge Sending U. S. Arms for Defense of Formosa ? Peace Treaty Issues Weighed Flsi the Associated Press . TOKYO , Monday , June 19 ? Defense secretary Louis Johnson and Gen. Omar N. Bradley met with Gen. Douglas today to hear the Far Eastern Commander 's views on America 's position in ICommunist-troub1Pii Asia . The Secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to General 's office in downtown Tokyo at 9:30 A. M. This is one hour earlier than General 's working day usually , begins . General was expected to tell the visiting chiefs that Formosa still could be saved from the Chinese Communists and thatUnited States equipment should be rushed there and to Southeast Asia . It is believed that General will elaborate on the factual background supplied to Mr. Johnson and General Bradley yesterday in a four-hour " briefing " by the Allied Commander 's chief subordinates .

Bradley . chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , held a round of conferences today with key officers of Gen. Douglas 's staff , in which they were understood to have covered a wide range of problems relating to United States security in Asia and the Pacific and the possibilities of a peace treaty with Japan . Arriving here early today , Mr. Johnson and General Bradley had meetings this morning and afternoon at the headquarters building . Although General favors - an early treaty with Japan , he is believed prepared to stress that the United States must in any // eventuality preserve its defense forces here .

Persons who are . presumably well informed hinted , however , that the briefing given Secretary . Johnson and General Bradley  --  which is expected to be , repeated , for John Foster Dulles , State Department adviser , when he comes here from Korea on Tuesday  --  had covered a broader field than had originally been expected . , The defense chiefs , it is believed , are - being informed ' of the headquarters views not only on the military situation . in Japan but on Political and economic questions here as well as the strategic picture involving a large area of Asia . The briefing was said to have included the most accurate information available here on the Soviet Union 's military position on the mainland and , its potentialities for aggression in the Pacific in case of war .

Whether General will seek similar reinforcements from the defense chiefs is not known , although it is : enderstood that tli'e Supreme Command earlier believed a considerably larger garrison might be-stationed in Japan either before the peace-treaty or after the conclusion of an agreement that would permit the United States to maintain bases here . For the last four years the United States has maintained four combat divisions here , plus an air force based on Japan and Okinawa .

The present garrison , they argue . could not hold more than a bridgehead in Japan if war came and if a close blockade of the Japanese islands were inaugurated possibly not even that , instead of indulging in abstract argument . " The newspaper continues : " If we do not side with the United States we will have to side with the Soviet Union . Even for such a great power as Britain neutrality is impossible . As for us , it is evident that even after the discontinuance of American direct aid Japan can not get along without United States assistance . There is nothing for us to do but rely on America 's goodwill . " Asahi suggests that after several years of general discussion , " it is possible the next ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

What is necessary here , these sources assert , is a force that while probably insufficient to defend . apan against a determined attack would be large enough to make any attempt at aggression expensive for the enemy . Such a force , this group believes , also would make enemy military concentrations against Western Europe difficult , compelling the Soviet Union to hold a considerable body of troops in the Far East , , lest Japan be used as a springboard against the Russians ' back door . - The Russians themselves contended that Japan , even before 1945 , - Was hostile nation despite her non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union , preciselyhecause.the presence of Japanese troops in Manchuria held down large Soviet contingents along the Siberian . border , preventing the full use of Russian strength against Germany .

Conservative newspapers also praise the Government 's attempt to form a " national front " of all major political'groups to handle treaty questions , rather than allow a possible peace offer to become a party issue .
