At its Dearborn . Mich , headquarters , Ford Motor Co. gave the press a quick preview of the 1958 models that the U.S. will see for the first time next week . As promised , the new Fords have plenty of changes to show for Stylist George Walker 's $185 million restyling : flashy new grilles , a lower-and longer-looking body , and a bigger , more economical V-8 engine that Ford hopes will cut gasoline bills as much as 15% ( TIME , July 8 ) . One major surprise : Ford will discontinue its famed two-seater Thunderbird , replace it with the long-planned four-seater model that is longer ( 113 in. wheelbase v. 102 in. wheelbase ) . but just as low and rakish . While the small T-bird has been a big success , with sales of 53,000 cars since 1954 ( five times as many as Chevrolet 's sporty Corvette ) , Ford thinks that the U.S. two-seater market is limited . Now it will shoot for broader fields in the growing family small-car market .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
