" Sadly aware of their own drawbacks , the rustic daughters of Roghudi could only sigh , and some among them hope that a day would come when handsome , dark-eyed Mayor Pietro Nucera might forget himself and take them by violence . In the harsh code of justice on the slopes of Aspromonte , the Harsh Mountains in the toe of Italy 's boot , the act of rape is often the precursor of enforced marriage , and the young mayor with his flashing eye and dark , curly hair had all the earmarks of a guappo-a dashing and romantic figure. * <P> But , alas for the women of Roghudi , an outsider able to read newspapers did at last find her way across the donkey trails and the single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Pietro raced off once again to Reggio and bought himself a book on how to write love letters . Francesca left his best efforts unanswered . <P> Sorry ! Spring came ; the teacher left the village , and when she returned again , she brought along a sister and a large , protective aunt . " Ah , " said the villagers with wise glances , " she has brought a chaperone . Now what will he do ? " For a year Pietro did nothing . Then he approached bluntly and announced : " I have decided I want to marry you . " " I am sorry , " said Francesca . " It can not be . " Stupefied , the mayor went to his uncle the priest .
