For weeks , barely below the diplomatic surface , there had been growing friction between the two great powers of the Western alliance . Finally , last week there was a spark big enough to blow British-U.S. differences into headlines all around the world . At his press conference Dwight Eisenhower said that the U.S. might move forward in a southeast Asia alliance without Great Britain . In the House of Commons , Winston Churchill agreed with a Laborite who said that the opening of U.S.-French talks on Indo-China without Britain was " inconsistent with the spirit of the Western alliance . " While some subsequent analyses of the U.S.-British rift were grossly exaggerated ( Pundits Joseph and Stewart Alsop labeled one column " The Dissolving Partnership " ) , the Western alliance was obviously under considerable strain . Why ? <P> The Backing Out . At the Four-Power Conference in Berlin last January , U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles voiced a warning to Britain 's Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and France 's Foreign Minister Georges Bidault : if IndoChina were included on the agenda of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve their bargaining position by an all-out military attack . Eden and Bidault agreed that the Communists might do just that . But they argued that public opinion at home forced them to take the risk ; the French thought that they could beat off the Red attack . Reluctantly , Dulles agreed to put IndoChina on the agenda . <P> As the Berlin Conference adjourned , Britain wanted a three-power conference forthwith , on what the West 's Indo-China policy should be at Geneva . But Dulles could not stay to confer ; he had to hurry back to the U.S. to explain the plans for Geneva to Congress . In any event , as the British soon found out , a conference at that point would have accomplished exactly nothing . Reason : the French had no idea what they wanted with regard to Indo-China , except peace at almost any price . <P> The Communist move that Dulles , had anticipated in Berlin was not long in coming . " Almost as rapidly as they could issue orders and gather their forces , " as one Administration official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was quickly apparent that , in spite of high words from the French , Dienbienphu was going to fall . Dulles began to search for a countermove that would shore up the West 's bargaining power . He decided to propose a conference on " united action " in Indo-China by ten powers-the U.S. , Britain , France , the Associated Indo-Chinese states , Thailand , the Philippines , New Zealand and Australia . <P> Dulles hurried to London to get a British commitment . He dined with Churchill and Eden , proposed that the conference begin in Washington just eight days later . Churchill and Eden agreed-or at least the U.S. got that impression . Then , just two days before the conference was to begin , British Ambassador Sir Roger Ma-kins called on Dulles with bad news : he had been instructed by London not to attend . Later , Sir Roger explained that the British Foreign Office , in agreeing to the conference , had overlooked the forthcoming Colombo , Ceylon conference of Asian Premiers . A precipitate British move to promote united action in Indo-China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as retrograde colonialism .
