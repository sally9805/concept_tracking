Viruses , the smallest of " living " things ( actually on the borderline between the animate and inanimate worlds ) , seek various kinds of higher cells to parasitize , according to their inscrutable , individual natures . What more logical , reasoned researchers , than to find a virus which would seek out cancer cells and thus , while procreating itself , destroy them ? <P> Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. chose cancer of the cervix to study , picked some odd particles called adenoviruses* to attack the tumors . Last week the N.I.H. 's Dr. <P> Robert J. Huebner gave some preliminary , still tentative results . <P> Adenoviruses and Coxsackie viruses ( which cause a disease like nonparalytic polio ) grown in cancer cells could , when injected directly into cervical cancers , cause the tumor to shrink and arrest the bleeding which troubled the patients . But they had no effect on the course of the disease : cancer cells on the edges of the tumor mass continued to proliferate and soon killed the patient . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that successive generations of the virus developed an increasing ability to kill cancer cells . Next step : to test the selectively bred viruses in human subjects , to see whether they have more lasting tumor-destroying powers . <P> <P> Five years after the cobalt-60 machine went into operation for cancer treatment at London , Ont. , Dr. Ivan Smith evaluated its advantages : it is best in cancer of the larynx , least effective in lung cancer ; it gives more relief in several other forms of cancer than ordinary X rays ; though it " has not revolutionized the treatment of cancer , " cobalt 60 is a boon because it does less damage to healthy skin and bone , is less likely to cause radiation sickness . <P> <P> *A newly coined name for viruses which cause upper respiratory infections somewhere between the common cold and influenza.
