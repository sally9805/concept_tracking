THE HORN ( 243 pp. ) - John Clellon Holmes-Random House ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> His name was Edgar Pool , and he was out of KayCee ( Kansas City , that is ) . Of course , no one but a square called him Edgar or Pool or even Eddie . He was simply " The Horn , " and , man , he could really blow . His deeds on the sax and his misdeeds on and off the bandstand made him a legend in his lifetime . The Horn was so hip that he just did not care . He had had all the booze , all the drugs , all the women . And he could blow his horn so marvelously that , through him , jazz achieved a new dimension . But he wound up broke , sodden drunk , embittered ; soon he would be dead . In The Horn , way-out Novelist John Clellon Holmes tries to suggest the forces that destroyed Edgar Pool . He does not succeed , but in failing he has still written the most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Man with a Horn ( 1938 ) . <P> Death of a Poet . Author Holmes , a leading member of San Francisco 's Beat Generation , makes the usual novelist 's disclaimer : his characters are not real people . Still , reading his book , any sensitive cat might think of someone like Tenor Saxman Lester Young or Charley ( " Yard-bird " ) Parker ( who died in 1955 at the age of 35 because he behaved too much like Edgar Pool ) . The prototype for Geordie . The Horn 's No. 1 chick , might be someone like Jazz Singer Billie Holiday . Actually , the resemblances are not important . This is a standard jazz story and , beyond that , basically the standard intellectual 's novel about the artist in the U.S. who is somehow made to feel that he is alien corn-or horn . That Edgar Pool is a Negro has little to do with it . Implicit in the book is the notion that Jazzman Pool died the death of a poet who lived in a country that does not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proving this case than do the little-magazine intellectuals for whom it is routine cocktail-party chatter . <P> What is good in The Horn is its good try at isolating the serious jazzman 's special brand of musical thinking . Like most good jazzmen , The Horn had the stuff in his blood . He taught himself to play because nothing else seemed to him more worth learning . His mother took in washing ; his father was a railroad hand who advised his son to get some kind of steady colored man 's job that carried a sure weekly wage . But Edgar Pool could hear nothing but the music within him . So he played , badly at first , but doggedly , and at last The Horn became so good that jazz fans and jazz pros alike revered him . There was always too much booze , and when it failed to give him the kicks he needed , the dope pushers showed another way . At the end , Pool lost his virility , his musical control , his desire to live . He was alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just long enough to hear a young newcomer blow him off the stand . <P> Author Holmes knows his jazz world . One of his scenes - a band rehearsal - is as funny and true as any writing about jazz in a long while . The Horn is sententious and overwritten , but it still manages to be a plausible and moving novel .
