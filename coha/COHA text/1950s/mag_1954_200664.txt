From Saigon , TIME Correspondent Dwight Martin cabled : <P> A sodden rot of defeat , surrender and demoralization is eating its way through the fragile fabric of earnest little Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem 's hard-trying but still disorganized South Viet Nam government . Diem 's power probably does not extend as far as 30 kilometers from Saigon itself , say some knowledgeable foreign observers , and in many instances not that far . At Mytho , at Baclieu , at Vinhlong and numberless other towns and villages in the south , Viet Minh control is complete and recognized-the presence of nominal officials of the Vietnamese government notwithstanding . <P> " The Viet Minh are agitating with a terrible intensity , " said a Frenchman . Said an American : " They are burrowing in , caching their arms . Will they send their troops out in accordance with the Geneva agreement ? Like hell they will . What they will do is send out a couple of phony battalions of peasants , accompanied by a few of their better-known cadres . They probably want the cadres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrugged in disgust and despair . <P> Choose Your Picture . In much of the Cochin China countryside in South Viet Nam a curious duality of administration exists . In Mytho there is a regular government court . But most of the townspeople take their grievances to a Communist court three kilometers outside the town . <P> In some areas , the Reds show the people booklets containing pictures of Ho Chi Minh and Bao Dai , ordering them to sign under the picture of their choice . There are few signatures for Bao Dai. * More effective still are the propaganda speeches and the carefully phrased whispers of the women who press the Communist advantage relentlessly . " We are winning , " they whisper . " We are winning . Do you want to be with us , or with the French and the foreigners ? The white men have surrendered half of your country ; they will surrender the other half too . Do not trust them . Come with us ! " <P> <P> At Cuchi , 25 kilometers northwest of Saigon , some 40 demonstrators-many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail of rifle fire from a Vietnamese army post , and the Communists got some useful martyrs . But though the triggers were pulled by Vietnamese , the real murderers were Communist agents provocateurs . Goaded and egged on by the Viet Minh , the demonstrators had besieged the post , alternately insulting , threatening and cajoling the Vietnamese soldiers to desert . <P> Face the Taunts . " Ah , yah , " cried the women scornfully . " Why do you want to be with the losers ? " Swarms of children pranced around the post , hooting and whooping derisively at the garrison . Some threw stones . A pretty young girl leaped forward from the crowd and slapped her belly . " Sons ? " she taunted . " Our bodies will bear no sons for traitors . " Some women bared their breasts at the troops to shame and disconcert them . <P> <P> Then from somewhere behind the demonstrators , shots rang out . The beleaguered garrison fell into the Communist trap and fired in earnest . " Murderers , murderers ! " the survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldiers who had fired , confused and shamed by what they had done , deserted . <P>
