Slamming Sam Snead , the lanky West Virginian whose tee-to-green game is the best in golf , was having a hot spell last week . Going into the final match of the Professional Golfers ' Association championship at the Oakmont ( Pa . ) Country <P> Club , Snead was 17 strokes under par after defeating five topflight opponents . Said Snead : " I do n't know that I 've ever scored better . " In the final , against Newcomer Walter Burkemo , Snead outdid himself . <P> A booming drive and a well-placed approach shot left him 40 ft. from the pin on the 483-yd. first hole ( par five ) . Burkemo , also well-placed , was in line for a birdie . He got it , too . Then Snead , taking dead aim from the fringe of the green , chipped into the cup for an eagle three . " After that start , " said Snead in his corn-pone drawl , " ah thought unless Burkemo goes hawg wile , ah 'd be O.K. Ah thought if a man ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sam won seven up . It was the handsomest winning margin since a newcomer named Sam Snead lost to Paul Runyan in the 1938 P.G.A . final , 8 and 7 . <P> If it were not for nonpareil Ben Hogan , Snead would be the No . I U.S. golfer . His one weakness , which has twice cost him the Open championship , is putting ; he tried 18 different putters in 1948 . Even so , he has won 73 tournaments since 1937 . Last year , leading the money winners for the third time , Snead banked $35,758.83 . His P.G.A . victory last week was his third ( the others : 1942 and 1949 ) , a mark equaled only by Gene Sarazen and bettered only by the great Walter Hagen . Snead is glum when he loses . Last week he was grinning from ear to ear as he signed autographs after his $3,500 victory . The signature : $am $nead.
