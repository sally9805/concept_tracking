Although European economic integration was stalled , the West had moved forward on a more immediately important front-Europe 's military defense . Last week the Communists were shifting position in an effort to counter this Western gain . <P> In the first years after World War II , Moscow strategists assumed that the Red Army could roll almost unopposed to the Atlantic if they decided to take the great chance on World War III . But it might be more prudent to capture Western Europe through the ballot box . Accordingly , Western European Communist Parties concentrated on political drives to exploit economic misery and insecurity . Their success was checked by the Marshall Plan , but they still knew that in event of war Western Europe offered no military obstacle to the Red Army . Last fall the Kremlin realized that the U.S. military aid program might change that fact . <P> At the November meeting of the Cominform in Hungary , Stalin 's representative , Mikhail A. Suslov , emphasized that France , as the key to Western Europe 's defense , must not be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sabotaging military reconstruction even if such a program cost them dearly in members and political influence . <P> Last week the new policy could be seen working on two fronts : 1 ) Russia recognized the government of Communist rebel Ho Chi Minh in Indo-China ; 2 ) French Communists prepared a wave of waterfront strikes to hamstring U.S. military aid . <P> Tough Slice . Purpose behind the open Soviet support of Ho was to make it harder for the French to restore order in Indo-China . The more military effort they are forced to spend on Ho , the less they would have to defend France . <P> Many Frenchmen were offended by this Russian diplomatic action on Indo-China ; more would be shocked when the French Communists showed their hand in sabotage of the military aid program . French Communist leaders understood this and moved with misgiving to carry out Moscow 's orders . Last month Communist Jacques Duclos said to a nonCommunist : " If we concentrate all our efforts on the problem of low wages and high living costs , in nine months we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good slice of the petite bourgeoisie . " <P> That was exactly the policy Moscow had told Duclos &; Co. not to follow . Instead , the French Reds were last week embarked reluctantly but obediently on the military sabotage policy which was sure to lose them votes and members . <P> The party put tough young Laurent ( " Eye of Moscow " ) Casanova in charge of the new effort . He sent organizers to Cherbourg to call dock strikes against the first ships bearing U.S. military aid ; these are due to arrive in about a month . <P> Casanova was having his troubles . The Communists have recently lost ground in French labor unions . Not a single important French union is now under firm Communist control . The one most nearly under the Red thumb is the longshoremen 's union . <P> Last week from the offices of Communist union officials in French ports came a stream of defiant announcements . Example : " In no circumstances will American war matriel be unloaded . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
