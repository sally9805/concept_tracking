txt JANE AND CHARLEY HAVE GONE TO THE PHILHARMONIC Abby Howland Woolsey On April 26th , 1862 , Abby Woolsey writes to her mother who had gone to Washington to see what was keeping Georgy happy there . We are all bright and well this fine morning . Jane and Charley have gone to the Philharmonic rehearsal and Carry is practicing some of her old music on the piano , in a way to make you , who love to hear it , happy . Mr. Prentiss came in last night to see us , looking well , but queer , as he alzays does in a black stock . He had been hard at work , moving his books , and did not intend to go to prayer meeting , and evidently did n't suppose we had gone , or he would n't have come to spend the evening with us . He told us much that was pleasant and funny about his visit in ' Washington , which , short as it was , paid him well , he thought , for going . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to Fort Monroe , as they are in a state of mind to be fretted and troubled if they do n't ... . Very few of the wounded brought by the Cossack from Newbern were landed here . . . . All were crazy to get home , all full of spirits and fun . The five or six who were carried to the N. E. Relief only fretted at having to spend a night longer on the road . The man with both legs gone smoked his pipe and read his newspaper . His chief anxiety was to go into New Jersey by a certain train . . . . Five or six ladies were at the rooms , Jane among them , yesterday , a lady apiece and several men to each volunteer . . . . No wonder it dazed an Irishman just released from four months ' imprisonment in Richmond . " Begor , " he said , " I ca n't pay for all this ! " . . . Jane says there is nothing much for the present set of ladies to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , on the closet shelves ? changing them about from the way she had fixed them ! They immediately proceeded to that work , and each new set of ladies will have that , at least , to occupy them . As for the Park Barracks , a portion of them have been scrubbed and whitewashed , the bunks taken down , neat iron beds all made and put up . Mrs. Mack is to live there as Matron , and , for the purpose of a mere halting place and infirmary , it is as good an one as they could have , though too many ladies were on hand , switching things over with their hoops , giving unlimited oranges to men who had the dysentery , and making the surgeons mad . There were , beside , half the medical students in the city , all staring and eager for jobs ; ? no difficulty in the men 's having all , and more than all , the attention they want . One good thing Mrs. Woodruff did , at Mrs. Buck 's suggestion ? sent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ordered a good dinner brought in of tender beef , fresh eggs , etc. , for the twenty or thirty New York and New Jersey men who were resting there . It will be charged to New York State , which supports the Barracks . . . . We have Lloyd 's map of Virginia under the front parlor picture of the Virgin , along the back of the sofa , and we sit there and read the papers and study it . THEY HAD JUST RECEIVED THEIR MARCHING ORDERS Georgeanna M. Woolsey Washington , March 10 , 1862 . All strange rumors come on Sunday . Josepha Crosby , natty , * and I went down to spend the afternoon at the Patent Office Hospital . During the week the camps had been emptied of convales- cents , sent North to recover , and their places in the hospitals were occupied by others . The Patent Office is full again , four rows of beds and very sick men in them . . . . Coming away I hurried up to Mrs. Captain Rodgers ' house and heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had of it was in church on Sunday morning , when , during service , a messenger came in and was seen to whisper something to General Meigs , who immediately left the church . A little later General Totten was summoned , and then a Commodore somebody , by which time the congregation was in a state of suppressed excitement miserable to bear . Dr. Pine preached an unusually long sermon , and finally , the people rushed out and heard the bad news . While I was talking at the door with Mrs. Rodgers a fourhorse ambulance was standing at McClellan 's door , and we sat down on the steps intending to see who got into it , and which way it went , a determination shared by plenty of other people on their way from church . At last a servant brought blankets , and McClellan and Franklin got in and started on their way over the Potomac ; and then I came home , and presently Colonel McClure came in and told us that Heintzelmann , with whom he had been sitting an hour , expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuated . Contrabands brought word of it to Kearney 's quarters ; he made an armed reconnaissance and discovered the truth ; word was sent to McClellan , and his ride on Sunday P.M. was in consequence . Mrs. Rodgers came in as we were in our petticoats , getting ready for bed , and confirmed it all . From the Journal of Eliza Woolsey Howland : We went to bed in a state of great excitement and were awakened early Monday morning by a knock from George and a note from Joe saying it was all true . He wrote at 2 A.M. , having been up all night . They had just received their marching orders ? the brigade to leave at 5 A.M. , the rest of the corps at 9 . I sent George over at once with a note to J. , and he found him on horseback just starting , the regiments formed and ready , and the General and staff in their saddles , all off for Fairfax Court House , which they reached , J. writes me , at 5 P.M. , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rebs have abandoned both Centreville and Manassas , falling back , the Star says , as far as the Rapidan and Gordonsville ? whether by panic or by a preconcerted plan is unknown . J. writes the climate at Fairfax C. H. is lovely and the air dry , pure , and very sweet , but the country is utterly desolate , houses burnt or pulled to pieces , fences gone , and the inhabitants , except a few miserable Negroes , fled . From the Journal of Georgeanna M. Woolsey : March ii . So the great move was made , the thing we had been looking forward to for so many months . The entire army was in motion , troops on the other side the river advancing , troops on this side taking their place . All day Monday and far into the night regiments marched over the bridges into Virginia ? fifty thousand over the Long bridge , they say , and to-day we drove up to the Chain bridge , and they told us fifteen thousand crossed there yesterday . We walked down towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14th street to see the move . As we crossed the canal , mother , Charley , and I , swinging along with the rest , three large army wagons brought up the rear , marked T.E. , carrying the telegraphic apparatus for the Engineers , and the wires must have been laid last night , for this morning General Williams had the announcement from McClellan ( who slept at Fairfax Court House ) , that our troops are in possession at Manassas . STONEWALL JACKSON IN DISGUISE Charlotte E. McKay In March , 1862 , after the deaths of her husband and only child , Charlotte E. McKay " turned the key in the door of her house " and left her home in Massachusetts to serve in a hospital in Frederick City , Maryland . I arrived on March 24 , 1862 , the day after the Battle , and started my nursing duties in two old stone buildings dating back to the time of Washington which had been converted into a temporary hospital . I had no time to brood about my personal sorrow for the sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our first care for them was sometimes before they were taken from the ambulances ? to administer food and slightly stimulating drinks ; wash them , dress their wounds , comb their hair and replace their bloody and torn garments by others clean and whole . One Sunday while superintending the distribution of dinner in my ward , I heard footsteps corning down the long walk and looking up saw the Chief Medical Officer preceded a little by a gentleman in citizen 's dress , whose appearance at once riveted my attention . There was nothing very striking in his brown suit , white cravat , sallow complexion , heavy grey beard , and anxious expression ; and yet on the whole he was remarkable , and I stood looking at him as he passed down , his keen eyes seeming to take in everything , especially the dinner that was being served out to our men , until with a slight bow he turned and passed out the side door . . . . " Do you know what strange gentleman inspected our hospital today ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked across the hospital grounds . " Oh , yes . That was Dr. George . He was a surgeon in the Crimean War . . . a good Union man . " A few weeks afterwards when our hospital and town were occupied by the Rebel army , I compared notes with one of the soldiers and learned that this man was Stonewall Jackson . " He often goes into your lines in disguise . . . and so acquaints himself with what is going on in your army . . . . " After the war was over , the report of my Rebel friend was confirmed by one of Stonewall Jackson 's staff officers . . . . He said that he was acquainted with the fact of General Jackson 's visit to Frederick about three weeks before Lee 's invasion of Maryland , and that he visited the hospitals , introducing himself as Dr. George . SHE DISCHARGED A PISTOL AT ME Sarah Emma Edmonds Emma was often sent out alone on foraging expeditions for the Army of the Potomac and met with many interesting adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started , all alone , for a five-mile ride to an isolated farmhouse . . . which report said was well supplied with all the articles of which I was in search . I cantered along briskly until I came to a gate which opened into a lane leading directly to the house . It was a large old-fashioned two-story house , with immense chimneys built outside , Virginia style . The farm appeared to be in good condition , fences all up , a rare thing on the Peninsula , and cornfields flourishing as if there were no such thing as war in the land . // I rode up to the house and dismounted , hitched my horse to a post at the door , and proceeded to ring the bell . A tall , stately lady made her appearance , and invited me in with much apparent courtesy . She was dressed in deep mourning , which was very becoming to her pale , sad face . She seemed to be about thirty years of age , very prepossessing in appearance , and evidently belonged to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated she inquired : " , To what fortunate circumstance am Ito attribute the pleasure of this unexpected call ? " I told her in a few words the nature of my business . The intelligence seemed to cast a deep shadow over her pale features , which all her efforts could not control . She seemed nervous and excited , and something in her appearance aroused my suspicion , notwithstanding her blandness of manner and ladylike deportment . She invited me into another room , while she prepared the articles which she proposed to let me have , but I declined , giving as an excuse that I preferred to sit where I could see whether my horse remained quiet . I watched all her movements narrowly , not daring to turn my eyes aside for a single moment . She walked round in her stately way for sorfie time , without accomplishing much in the way of facilitating my departure , and she was evidently trying to detain me for some purpose or other . Could it be that she was meditating the best mode of attack , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detain me until their arrival ? Thoughts like these passed through my mind in quick succession . At last I rose up abruptly , and asked her if the things were ready . She answered me with an assumed smile of surprise , and said : " Oh , I did not know that you were in a hurry : I was waiting for the boys to come and catch some chickens for you . " " And pray , madam , where are the boys ? " I asked ; " Oh , not far from here , " was her reply . " Well , I have decided not to wait ; you will please not detain me longer , " said I , as I moved toward the door . She began to pack some butter and eggs both together in a small basket which I had brought with me , while another stood beside her without anything in it . I looked at her ; she was trembling violently , and was as pale as death . In a moment more she handed me the basket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , it was no consequence about the pay " ; she did not wish anything for it . So I thanked her and went out . In a few moments she came to the door , but did not offer to assist me , or to hold the basket , or anything , but stood looking at me most maliciously , I thought . I placed the basket on the top of the post to which my horse had been hitched , took my seat in the saddle , and then rode up and took my basket . Turning to her I bade her good morning , and thanking her again for her kindness , I turned to ride away . I had scarcely gone a rod when she discharged a pistol at me ; by some intuitive movement I threw myself forward on my horse 's neck and the ball passed over my head . I turned my horse in a twinkling , and grasped my revolver . She was in the act of firing the second time , but was so excited that the bullet went wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , considering where to aim . I did not wish to kill the wretch , but did intend to wound her . When she saw that two could play at this game , she dropped her pistol and threw up her hands imploringly . I took deliberate aim at one of her hands , and sent the ball through the palm of her left hand . She fell to the ground in an instant with a loud shriek . I dismounted , and took the pistol which lay beside her , and placing it in my belt , proceeded to take care of her ladyship after the following manner : I unfastened the end of my halter strap and tied it painfully tight around her right wrist , and remounting my horse , I started , and brought the lady to consciousness by dragging her by the wrist two or three rods along the ground . I stopped , and she rose to her feet , and with wild entreaties she begged me to release her , // but , instead of doing so , I presented a pistol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream she was a dead woman . In that way I succeeded in keeping her from alarming anyone who might be within calling distance , and so made my way toward McClellan 's headquarters . After we had gone in that way about a mile and a half , I told her that she might ride if she wished to do so , for I saw she was becoming weak from loss of blood . She was glad to accept the offer , and I bound up her hand with my handkerchief , gave her my scarf to throw over her head , and assisted her to the saddle . I marched along beside her , holding tight to the bridle rein all the while . When we were about a mile from McClellan 's headquarters she fainted , and I caught her as she was falling from the horse . I laid her by the roadside while I went for some water , which I brought in my hat , and after bathing her face for some time she recovered . For the first time since we started I entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three weeks she had lost her father , husband , and two brothers in the Rebel army . They had all belonged to a company of sharpshooters , and were the first to fall . She had been almost insane since the intelligence reached her . She said I was the first Yankee that she had seen since the death of her relatives , the evil one seemed to urge her on to the step she had taken , and if I would not deliver her up to the military powers , she would go with me and take care of the wounded . She even proposed to take the oath of allegiance , and seemed deeply penitent . Soon after this conversation we started for camp , she weak and humbled , and I strong and rejoicing . None ever knew from that day to this the secret of that secesh woman becoming a nurse . Instead of being taken to General McClellan 's headquarters , she went direct to the hospital , where Dr. P. dressed her hand , which was causing her extreme pain . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a hospital steward , and brought away everything which could be made use of in the hospitals , and so took up her abode with us . Her name was Alice M. , but we called her Nellie J. She soon proved the genuineness of her conversion to the Federal faith by her zeal for the cause which she had so recently espoused . As soon as she was well enough to act in the capacity of nurse she commenced in good earnest , and became one of the most faithful and efficient nurses in the Army of the Potomac . A SECRET EXPEDITION FOR MC CLELLAN Sarah Emma Edmonds Through the Army chaplain , who was a friend of hers , Emma learned that one of General McClellan 's spies had been executed at Richmond , and that it would be necessary to fill his place at once . The perilous undertakings of a Union spy seemed far more enticing to her adventurous spirit than nursing , which had grown monotonous , and she went to Washington to apply L for the position . After a careful examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course known to the military only as Franklin Thompson , was accepted as a member of the secret service and given her first assignment . Disguised as a Negro boy , she was sent behind enemy lines at Yorktown to learn about the Rebel fortifications there . My arrangements were soon made , and I was ready to start on my first secret expedition toward the Confederate capital . With a few hard crackers in my pocket and my revolver loaded and capped , I started on foot , without even a blanket or any140 Noble Women of the North thing which might create suspicion . At half past nine o'clock I passed through the outer picket line of the Union army , at twelve o'clock I was within the Rebel lines , and had not so much as been halted once by a sentinel . I had passed within less than ten rods of a Rebel picket , and he had not seen me . I took this as a favorable omen , and thanked heaven for it . As soon as I had gone a safe distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The night was chilly and the ground cold and damp , and I passed the weary hours in fear and trembling . The first object which met my view in the morning was a party of Negroes carrying out hot coffee and provisions to the rebel pickets . This was another fortunate circumstance , for I immediately made their acquaintance , and was rewarded for my promptness by receiving a cup of coffee and a piece of corn bread , which helped very much to chase away the lingering chills of the preceding night . I remained there until the darkies returned , and then marched into Yorktown with them without eliciting the least suspicion . The Negroes went to work immediately on the fortifications after reporting to their overseers , and I was left standing alone , not having quite made up my mind what part to act next . I was saved all further trouble in that direction , for my idleness had attracted the notice of an officer , who stepped forward and began to interrogate me after the following manner : " Who do you belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I answered in my best Negro dialect : " I dus n't belong to nobody , Massa , I'se free and allers was ; I'se gwyne to Richmond to work . " But that availed me nothing , for turning to a man who was dressed in citizen 's clothes and who seemed to be in charge of the colored department , he said : " Take that black rascal and set him to work , and if he do n't work well tie him up and give him twenty lashes , just to impress upon his mind that there 's no free niggers here while there 's a D  --  d Yankee left in Virginia . " // So saying he rode away , and I was conducted to a breastwork which was in course of erection , where about a hundred Negroes were at work . I was soon furnished with a pickaxe , shovel , and a monstrous wheelbarrow , and I commenced forthwith to imitate my companions in bondage . That portion of the parapet upon which I was sent to work was about eight feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single planks , one end of which rested on the brow of the breastwork and the other on the ground . I need not say that this work was exceedingly hard for the strongest man ; but few were able to take up their wheelbarrows alone , and I was often helped by some goodnatured darkie when I was just on the verge of tumbling off the plank . All day long I worked in this manner , until my hands were blistered from my wrists to the finger ends . The colored men 's rations were different from those of the soldiers . They had neither meat nor coffee , while the white men had both . Whiskey was freely distributed to both black and white , but not in sufficient quantity to unfit them for duty . The soldiers seemed to be as much in earnest as the officers , and could curse the Yankees with quite as much vehemence . Notwithstanding the hardships of the day I had had my eyes and cars open , and had gained more than would counterbalance the day 's work . Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was free to go where I pleased within the fortifications , and I made good use of my liberty . I made out a brief report of the mounted guns which I saw that night in my ramble round the fort , viz. : fifteen three-inch rifled cannon , eighteen four-and-a-half-inch rifled cannon , twenty-nine thirty-two-pounders , twenty-one forty-twopounders , twenty-three eight-inch Columbiads , eleven nine-inch Dahlgrens , thirteen ten-inch Columbiads , fourteen ten-inch mortars , and seven eight-inch siege howitzers . This , together with a rough sketch of the outer works , I put under the inner // sole of my contraband shoe and returned to the Negro quarters . Finding my hands would not be in a condition to shovel much earth on the morrow , I began to look round among the Negroes to find someone who would exchange places with me whose duty was of a less arduous character . I succeeded in finding a lad of about my own size who was engaged in carrying water to the troops . He said he would take my place the next day , and he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following , for which brotherly kindness I gave him five dollars in greenback ; but he declared he could not take so much money ? " he neber had so much money in all his life before . " So by that operation I escaped the scrutiny of the overseer , which would probably have resulted in the detection of my assumed African complexion . The second day in the Confederate service was much pleasanter than the first . I had only to supply one brigade with water , which did not require much exertion , for the day was cool and the well was not far distant ; consequently I had an opportunity of lounging a little among the soldiers , and of hearing important subjects discussed . In that way I learned the number of reinforcements which had arrived from different places , and also had the pleasure of seeing General Lee , who arrived while I was there . It was whispered among the men that he had been telegraphed to for the purpose of inspecting the Yankee fortifications , as he was the best engineer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold Yorktown after McClellan opened his siege guns upon it . Then , too , General J. E. Johnson * was hourly expected with a portion of his command . Including all , the Rebels estimated their force at one hundred and fifty thousand at Yorktown and in that vicinity . When Johnson arrived there was a council of war held , and things began to look gloomy . Then the report began to circulate // that the town was to be evacuated . One thing I noticed in the Rebel army , that they do not keep their soldiers in the dark as our officers do with regard to the movements and destination of the troops . When an order comes to the Federal army requiring them to make some important movement , no person knows whether they are advancing or retreating until they get to Washington , or in sight of the enemy 's guns , excepting two or three of the leading generals . Having a little spare time I visited my sable friends and carried some water for them . After taking a draught of the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puzzled sort of manner , and turning round to one of his companions , said : " Jim , I 'll be darned if that feller ai n't turnin ' white ; if he ai n't then I 'm no nigger . " I felt greatly alarmed at the remark , but said , very carelessly , " Well , gem'in , I'se allers ' spected to come white some time ; my mudder 's a white woman . " This had the desired effect , for they all laughed at my simplicity , and made no further remarks upon the subject . As soon as I could conveniently get out of sight I took a look at my complexion by means of a small pocket looking-glass which I carried for that very purpose ? and sure enough , as the negro had said , I was really turning white . I was only a dark mulatto color now , whereas two days previous I was as black as Cloe . However , I had a small vial of nitrate of silver in weak solution , which I applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my post with a fresh supply of water , I saw a group of soldiers gathered around some individual who was haranguing them in real Southern style . I went up quietly , put down my cans of water , and of course had to fill the men 's canteens , which required considerable time , especially as I was not in any particular hurry just then . I thought the voice sounded familiar , and upon taking a sly look at the speaker I recognized him at once as a peddler who used to come to the Federal camp regularly once every week with newspapers and stationery , and especially at headquarters . He would hang round there , under some pretext or other , for half a day at a time . There he was , giving the Rebels a full description of our camp and forces , and also brought out a map of the entire works of McClellan 's position . On the evening of the third day from the time I entered the camp of the enemy I was sent , in company with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts on the right wing . This was just what I wished for , and had been making preparations during the day , in view of the possibility of such an event , providing among other things a canteen full of whiskey . Some of the men on picket duty were black and some were white . I had a great partiality for those of my own color , so calling out several darkies I spread before them some corn cake , and gave them a little whiskey for dessert . While we were thus engaged the Yankee Minie balls were whistling round our heads , for the picket lines of the contending parties were not half a mile distant from each other . The Rebel pickets do not remain together in groups of three or four as our men do , but are strung along , one in each place , from three to four rods apart . I proposed to remain a while with the pickets , and the darkies returned to camp without me . Not long after night an officer came riding along the lines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the darkies replied that I had helped to carry out their supper , and was waiting until the Yankees stopped firing before I started to go back . Turning to me he said , " You come along with me . " I did as I was ordered , and he turned and went back the same way he came until we had gone about fifty yards , then halting in front of a petty officer he said , " Put this fellow on the post where that man was shot until I return . " I was conducted a few rods farther , and then a rifle was put into my hands , which // I was told to use freely in case I should see anything or anybody approaching from the enemy . Then followed the flattering remark , after taking me by the coat collar and giving me a pretty hard shake , " Now , you black rascal , if you sleep on your post I 'll shoot you like a dog . " The night was very dark , and it was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before the officer might return with some one to fill my place I did not know , and I thought the best thing I could do was to make good use of the present moment . After ascertaining as well as possible the position of the picket on each side of me , each of whom I found to be enjoying the shelter of the nearest tree , I deliberately and noiselessly stepped into the darkness , and was soon gliding swiftly through the forest toward the " land of the free , " with my splendid rifle grasped tightly lest I should lose the prize . I did not dare to approach very near the Federal lines , for I was in more danger of being shot by them than by the enemy ; so I spent the remainder of the night within hailing distance of our lines , and with the first dawn of morning I hoisted the well-known signal and was welcomed once more to a sight of the dear old stars and stripes . I went immediately to my tent . . . . After removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap and water to do , my complexion was a nice maroon color , which my new costume showed off to good advantage . Had my own mother seen me then , it would have been difficult to convince her of our relationship . I made out my report immediately and carried it to General McClellan 's headquarters , together with my trophy from the land of traitors . . . . The rifle was sent to ' Washington , and is now in the Capital as a memento of the war ... . 6 The Fleet of Mercy EARLY IN 1862 , WHEN THE BATTLEFRONTS HAD OPENED ALL ALONG the waterways in the West , the Medical Department had had no means of getting to the scene of action to treat the sick and wounded nor of transferring them to the general hospitals . Many military men still believed that when there was active fighting , the fighting power would be weakened and the - Army personnel unnecessarily burdened if transportation were used to carry the sick and wounded and medical stores . To meet this new emergency , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Secretary , Frederick Law Olmsted , took over certain large steamers not be ing used by the Government , . and fitted them up as floating howls with medical supplies , sanitary stores , and their own hospital corps , at no expense to the Government . It was Mr. Olmsted 's plan to have the boats kept in readiness so teat when a battle occurred they would be prepared to receive the sick and wounded , and if necessary to treat them on the spot . While the states of the Union had been celebrating the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson , hundreds of the soldiers who had been wounded in winning these battles were taken from the bloodstained snow with their garments frozen on them . They had been left lying where they fell that bitter morning until they froze to the ground . The Army had no time to look after them ? there were no available places to be used as hospitals and many of the men lay suffering with their clothes on and their wounds undressed until they perished on the battlefield . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital steamer City of Memphis , loaded with Sanitary Commission stores taken on at Cairo . Telegrams for medical aid were sent to Chicago and physicians arrived on the first trains . Two days later a number of Sanitary Commission steamers brought efficient relief . The United States Sanitary Commission transport system got started in the East after many tedious delays . The sudden transfer of the scene of active war from the high banks of the Potomac to a low and swampy region intersected by a network of rivers and creeks demanded facilities for the proper care of the sick and wounded that had not been anticipated by the Government arrangements . After postponements and disappointments of various kinds ? one fine large boat having been assigned , partially furnished by the Commission , and then withdrawn ? an order was at length received authorizing the United States Sanitary Commission to take possession of any of the Government transports not in actual use that were lying at Alexandria . The only vessel then lying at Alexandria hardy enough for ocean passage from Virginia to New York or Boston proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer of limited capacity . She had recently been stripped of everything movable but dirt , so that the task of turning her into a hospital boat was no mean one . But within a very few days the Daniel Webster was ready for service , scrubbed and whitewashed to the steerage , the bulkhead of the wings of the engineroom section knocked away so as to get a through draft from stem to stern , with new bunks and an apothecary shop . At the end of April the Daniel Webster made its first trip to York River , and was soon followed by the steamer Knickerbocker , and a whole succession of other boats assigned to the Commission . Among the first women to serve in the East were // Georgeanna Woolsey , her sister , Eliza Howland , and Katharine P. Wormeley , on the Wilson Small , and Eliza Harris on the Vanderbilt . The hospital transports plowed back and forth up and down the rivers carrying their human cargo from the battlefield to the bases nearest the hospitals in Washington . Yorktown , White House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potomac . The workers in the hospital transport service were taxed to the utmost . No duty was said to be more exhausting in its character nor more important in its results . The number of lives saved through this on-the-scene care as envisioned by Mr. Olmsted is incalculable . The efficiency with which the hospital service carried on its program is a great tribute to the men and women who served with the Sanitary Commission in this field . ' When freight or hospital cars from the battlefields or ambulances and stretchers from the nearby hospitals arrived at the wharves , the fleet of mercy was ready for them . Stretchers were carried up the companionway or elevated and then lowered to the cabins by pulleys and the men then hoisted to the berths or placed on cots . Often these terrible processions came so thick and fast that every berth was filled and the men packed in so closely that there was hardly room enough to go around them . After a bloody battle the cabin of one hospital boat where operations were performed " ran in streams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismembered formed a stack of human limbs . " Often the boats were directly in the line of shell and gunfire , and the Commission surgeons and nurses aboard risked their own lives as they stood by prepared to minister to the critically injured . Hospital boats were usually anchored alongside each other with their gangways connected , the nurses running through four or five boats at a time . A second squad of the Hospital Corps was detailed to accoinThe // pany the patients from the battlefield bases to hospitals in New York , Philadelphia , Boston , and other Northern cities . The transport system was in complete working order when McClellan marched up the Peninsula with his Army of the Potomac , after leaving his elaborate defenses at Yorktown to go in pursuit of the retreating Confederates , and finally pushed his pickets to within four miles of Richmond . Then , on May 30 , just when things were beginning to look up for McClellan , there was a torrential storm . The Chickahominy overflowed , threatening to sweep away McClellan 's bridges . McClellan 's advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bulk of the Army by the swollen Chickahominy . The Rebels took advantage of the desperate plight of the bluecoats and at one o'clock in the afternoon made a violent attack upon Casey 's division , followed by an equally formidable one on General Couch in the vicinity of Fair Oaks Station . Total annihilation of the Federals seemed to be the enemy 's goal and it looked very much as if they would be successful in driving the Yankees into the Chickahominy unless reinforcements arrived . General Heintzelman quickly ordered two brigades of Kearny 's division to move a quarter of a mile in front of Savage 's Station in support of Casey , and the enemy was held until they were reinforced by Generals Sedgwick and Richardson . The Battle of Fair Oaks ( or Seven Pines ) was the greatest fought in the Eastern theater of the ' War up to this time . The Rebels were driven back and McClellan retained his position . They attempted to renew the fight on Sunday morning but were beaten back at every point . Losses on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was put to a crucial test . From the Battle of Fair Oaks at the end of May to the great Seven Days ' Battle that began on June 25 , more and more // women became involved in hospital duty on the Peninsula . At Mechanicsville , Gaines 's Mill , Garnett 's Farm , Peach Orchard , Savage 's Station , White Oak , Glendale , New Market , and Malvern Hill the women of the North were under gunfire on the shore and on the waterways . McClellan failed to take Richmond . At the end of the bloody week of fighting , White House Landing on the York River , where the Sanitary Commission had a large hospital center and supply base , had to be abandoned , and a quick getaway managed almost under Rebel shot and shell . Here the efficiency of the transport system was put to a still further test as the women saw to it that all the sick and wounded were taken from tents and hospitals before the boats sailed down the river in the wake of McClellan 's retreating army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the James River . Tens of thousands of soldiers were ill with malaria from the Chickahominy swamps , and these men with the wounded who accumulated more rapidly than the transports could carry them away kept part of the Woolsey family , Eliza Harris , and others well occupied throughout July and August . At Harrison 's Landing the condition of the sick and wounded was pitiful . The Medical Department seems to have become demoralized at this point . All the things required for the patients were lacking . The pasty adhesive mud was everywhere , and the hospital tents , old , mildewed , and leaky , were pitched in it , with no floors provided . Where tents were supplied they were either of the " wedge " pattern or the bivouacking kind of black cloth which was no protection against the hot Virginia sun . Many of the patients had to be put into cabins and miserable shanties in the vicinity , sometime seven in the attics of such places . Here they were left without food or drink unless some of the Sanitary Commission agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agent for the Philadelphia Aid Society , looked after their // needs . Hard tack , salt junk , fat salt pork , and cold greasy bean soup was the diet provided for the men suffering from typhoid fever and from wounds that rendered liquid food indispensaable . Soft bread had been promised to the men , but it did not arrive until it was time to break up camp . On July 22 , Dr. Henry W. Bellows reported that " The Hospital Transport System had worked better and better up to this date . It has fully realized our expectations in the amount of comfort , diminution of suffering , and of saving human life ... . No money could ever reckon the service it has accorded . It has disappointed us only in one respect , but that is a cardinal point . ... It has not provoked the imitation of the United States Government in its own transport for the sick and wounded men . They do not appear to be any better for our example . . . They do not seem to be improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow our style of organization . . . . Mr. Olmsted doubts whether it is possible for the medical authorities to pay much attention to the example or advice of unofficial coworkers like ourselves . . . . We have succeeded both in the East and West in bringing a large share of more than half of all our sick and wounded men throughout the army to healthy and comfortable hospitals of the North . . . . There has been inevitable jealousy in our transport service . We have had to push our salubrious boats upon the medical directors who are more ready to use their own simply because they own their own . I do not yet see a thorough statement of this jealousy even under Dr. Hammond . Perhaps it is too much to expect of official human nature . . . . " But from this time on the transport service will be less important . The Government is very wisely changing its policy . . . or the lack of it . It has been compelled to bring North its sick and wounded as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital transport service came to an end , the whole staff of the Wilson Small fell back on Washington . Katharine Wormeley came home on the old hospital ship the Daniel Webster , in charge of the last load of wounded from the Peninsula , and Georgeanna and Eliza went to New York for a visit before returning to hospital duty in Washington . RUN FOR THE RIVER-THE REBELS ARE COMING ! Belle Reynolds Although this account is from the Western front it reveals the effective use to which the United States Sanitary Commission transports were put before they appeared on the Eastern front . Belle Reynolds had remained with her husband 's regiment , following it in all its campaigning . In the early part of February , 1862 , General Grant began the campaign that terminated in the capture of Corinth and Memphis and the opening of the upper part of the Mississippi Valley . Mrs. Reynolds was present at the Battle of Pittsburgh Landing , having embarked on March 21 on the Steamer D. A. January for this battleground . Ten miles above the landing the passengers disembarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most romantic spot . " Deserted cabins were everywhere . Shiloh Meeting House and the cool spring were all that made the place look as if ever trod by the foot of man . She wrote : April 4 . The long roll has called the regiment out , and we know not what an hour may bring forth . Pickets have been driven in , and skirmishing is going on at the front . Distant The Fleet of Mercy 15 3 musketry and the rumbling of artillery past my tent give the situation a look of reality which I had not dreamed of an hour ago . Although so near the enemy 's lines , we feel no fear . Mrs. N. and myself are the only ladies in camp , and our tents are adjoining . April 17 . On Sunday morning at sunrise we heard the roll of distant musketry ; but supposing it to be the pickets discharging their pieces , we paid no attention to it . In about an hour after , while preparing breakfast over the campfire , which Mrs. N. and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howling over our heads . Immediately the long roll was beaten , and orders came from the commanding officer of the brigade to fall in . Knowing my husband must go , I kept my place before the fire , that he might have his breakfast before leaving ; but there was no time for eating , and though shells were flying faster , and musketry coming nearer , compelling me involuntarily to dodge as the missiles shrieked through the air , I still fried my cakes , and rolling them in a napkin , placed them in his haversack , and gave it to him just as he was mounting his horse to assist in forming the regiment . His last words to me , as he rode away , were , " What will you do , Belle ? " I little knew then what I should do ; but there was no time to hesitate , for shells were bursting in every direction about us . Tents were torn in shreds , and the enemy , in solid column , was seen coming over the hill in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to pack our trunks , were doing so , when the wagon-master told us we must run for our lives ; so , snatching our travelling baskets , bonnets in hand , we left the now deserted camp . ' We passed the large parade ground , close by our camp , where the cavalry was forming . Balls were flying and shells bursting among the terrified horses and fearless riders . On reaching General Ross 's headquarters , supposing ourselves at a perfectly safe distance from the Rebels , we took possession of a deserted tent , and sat // resting ourselves , when Lieutenant Williams , acting quartermaster , passing by , saw us sitting there , apparently regardless of the flying missiles . " For God 's sake , " exclaimed he , " run for the river ; the Rebels are coming ! " We were by this time convinced of their close proximity ; for we had scarcely left when a shell exploded close by , the pieces tearing through the tent , and a solid shot passed through headquarters . The troops were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thousands , fresh and hopeful , and sanguine as to the result of the conflict in which they were hastening to engage . Others were going towards the river , many sick , and scarcely able to drag themselves along through the almost impassable roads ; and we , while hurrying along , were constantly asked , " What 's the matter back here , ladies ? " But soon enough they ascertained , for the enemy were pressing closer and closer , and the musketry coming nearer and nearer each moment . When within about half a mile from the river , we came upon a number of ambulances , from which the wounded were being taken and laid upon the ground for the surgeons ' attention . We stopped , took off our bonnets , and prepared to assist in dressing their wounds ; but in less than ten minutes an orderly came dashing up , with orders to move the wounded immediately to the river , as the Rebels were pressing so closely , they were not safe where they were . The surgeon said we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find plenty to do . So we made our way to the steamer Emerald , Captain Norton 's headquarters ; and , just as we were going aboard , General Grant and staff came up from Savannah . Anxious faces they all wore , though they little knew what lay before them . We were rejoiced to find that Mrs. C. , one of our nurses , had arrived from Illinois , with quite a large supply of hospital stores , for they came not an hour too soon . A few moments after our arrival ( about ten o'clock A.M. ) , Sergeant Autcliff , Company A , was brought on board , supported by two comrades . Both arms were // broken . His greeting to Captain Norton was , " Well , captain , they have winged me . " To see that strong man , now utterly helpless , and almost fainting from loss of blood , and exhausted from a walk of nearly two miles , was a piteous sight indeed . Soon the wounded came pouring in upon us , and for thirtysix hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty wounded on board our boat . I dared not ask the boys if my husband was unharmed , and feared each moment to see him among the almost lifeless forms that were being brought on board the boat . Through the day the thunder of artillery had almost deafened us ; the air seemed filled with leaden hail , and the spent balls would patter upon the deck like a summer shower . Solid shot , directed at the ammunition boat , which was close by us , would pass over our heads and drop into the water . As the sun went down our army was gradually nearing the river : resistance to the infuriated masses opposed to them had been impossible . The Rebels now occupied all the camps of the Federal army , and the alternative to perish beneath the waves of the Tennessee , or surrender to the exultant foe was before them . Never had the fate of an army been more desperate , or its ruin more inevitable . Panic seized the half-crazed men , and rushing down the steep declivity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing his own safety , regardless of others . Many attempted to crowd upon the hospital boats ; others swam to the opposite shore . Captain N. guarded the gangplank with a revolver in each hand , and giving me another , I stationed myself upon the hurricane deck , prepared to execute any orders he might give me . But deliverance came to the disheartened army ; the gunboats Lexington and Tyler arrived from below , and steaming up to the mouth of a little stream , called Licking Creek , they opened a deadly fire upon the Rebel army . Broadside after broadside of sixty-four-pounders was discharged into // the midst of the now terrified foe . Fresh courage seemed infused into our dispirited ranks , for now across the river we could see the long-expected troops hurrying forward at double quick to our rescue . How we cheered them ! All the transports were put in requisition to ferry them across , that they might add to the waning strength of the almost defeated army . Every effort was made to inspire the panic-stricken hundreds with fresh courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene of terror . Rations , forage , and ammunition were trampled into the mud by an excited and infuriated crowd . Officers were rushing around , vainly endeavoring to collect the stragglers from their commands , and lead them once more to the scene of conflict . Trains were huddled together on the brow of the hill and in sheltered places . Ambulances were conveying their bleeding loads to the different boats , and joined to form a Babel of confusion indescribable . None were calm , and free from distracting anxiety and pain , save the long ranks of dead , ranged for recognition or burial , at the hospital on the hillside . Night closed the scene . The two armies rested for the morrow 's conflict ; ours sad and disheartened , theirs hopeful and almost victorious . The . gunboats were doing a great work ; one after the other would send a broadside ; and we , watching from the deck , would listen until the explosion , and then shout for joy . They were tokens of remembrance sent to our beleaguered friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing to the wounded on the battlefield ! IIour after hour passed , and the storm increased ; but above all was the solemn thunder of the gunboat cannon . Towards morning we dropped down to Savannah , and unloaded the wounded ; and morning found us again at work , dressing the wounds of others , who had but just been brought from the field . In all this time I heard nothing of my husband . I dared not ask those who had come from the field . I would wait until I should hear that all was well with him , or see him face to face . // The mud and rain made it impossible to extend our labors beyond the boat ; and reports were continually coming to us that the rebels were retreating , and that our army , strengthened and encouraged by the arrival of Buell 's command , would probably push them to Corinth . They had passed beyond our camps , and the way was strewn with dead and dying . Lieutenant Colonel Smith came from the regiment about dark , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through that terrible battle unharmed , though his horse had been shot under him . How thankful I was none can know but those who have endured like suspense and anxiety . There had been no preparation made for a two days ' battle when the army left their comfortable quarters on Sunday morning , and no rations had been provided . I knew there was a large supply of bread on hand , and making arrangements with the cook for a dozen loaves , I supplied the colonel with some impromptu saddlebags , and filling them to the brim , and tying each end , he threw them across his horse , and started off . Fortunately for him , darkness enveloped him , or he might not have arrived with his precious freight . That night we rested , though the storm was still raging . Wednesday morning the sun came forth upon a scene of blood and carnage such as our fair land had never known . The roads were almost impassable ; yet we felt it our duty to go out , and do all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAPER IS THE COVER OF THE SUGAR BOX Georgeanna M. Woolsey The women on the transports were often able to observe the entire proceedings of a battle , and any other goings-on on land or water . // Georgeanna takes time out from her duties to write her mother from aboard the steamer Knickerbocker . If my letter smells of " Yellow B. " sugar , it has a right to , as my paper is the cover of the sugar box . Since I wrote I have been jumping round from boat to boat , and Saturday came on board the Knickerbocker at Mr. Olmsted 's request , with Mrs. Strong and some others , to put things in order , and , privately , to be on hand to " hold " the boat , which had been made over to the Commission , over the heads of the New Jersey delegation . Dr. Asch was on board , and we had the New Jersey dinner table abolished and fifty-six Sanitary Commission beds made on the dining-room floor that night . The two hundred wounded and sick brought down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore hospital , where we stole some roses for our patients on the Small . Saw regiments embarking for Norfolk , which surrendered the next day . Saw Mr. Lincoln driving past to take possession of Norfolk ; and by Tuesday had the boat all in order again , with the single exception of a special-diet cooking stove . So we went ashore at Gloster Point sic ransacked all the abandoned Rebel huts to find one , coming down finally upon the sutler of the " Enfants Perdus , " who was cooking something nice for the officers ' mess over a stove with four places for pots . This was too much to stand ; so under a written authority given to " Dr. Olmsted " by the quartermaster of this department , we proceeded to rake out the sutler 's fire and lift off his pots , and he offered us his cart and mule to drag the stove to the boat and would take no pay ! So through the wretched town filled with the debris of huts and camp furniture , old blankets , dirty cast-off clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filth everywhere , and along the sandy shore covered with cannon balls , we followed the mule ? a triumphant procession , waving our broken bits of stovepipe and iron pot-covers . I left // a polite message for the Colonel " Perdu , " which had to stand him in place of his lost dinner . I shall never understand what was the matter with that sutler , whose self-sacrifice was to secure some three hundred men their meals promptly . We set up our stove in the Knickerbocker , unpacked tins and clothing , filled a linen closet in each ward , made up beds for three hundred , set the kitchen in order , and arranged a black hole with a lock to it , where oranges , brandy , and wine are stored box upon box ; and got back to Yorktown to find everybody at work fitting up the Spaulding . I have a daily struggle with the darkeys in the kitchen , who protest against everything . About twenty men are fed from one pail of soup , and five from a loaf of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of food is enough . One gets toughened on one 's fourth hospital ship and now I could stop at nothing ; but it is amusing to see the different ways taken to discover the same thing . Dr. McC. : " **93;0;TOOLONG ? " Dr. A. : " Turn over my friend , have you got the diaree ? " Dr. A. was in a state of indignation with Miss Dix in the shore hospital at Yorktown . She has peculiar views on diet , not approving of meat , and treating all to arrowroot and farina , and by no means allowing crackers with gruel . " Them does not go with this , " as Dr. A. gracefully puts the words into Miss Dix 's mouth . I WISH TO JOIN THE HOSPITAL TRANSPORT SERVICE Katharine P. Wormeley I3ritish-born Katharine Prescott Wormeley had many rare qualities that endeared her to people of all levels of society , and // made her one of the most discussed women of her day . Mary A. Livermore and Frances E. Willard called her the " woman of the century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who in America in 1908-9 and numerous magazine articles were devoted to her life . Katharine Wormeley was born on January 14 , 1830 , in Ipswich , England , the second of the three daughters of Ralph Randolph , a Rear Admiral in the British navy , and Caroline Wormeley . When she was about eighteen years old her family moved to the United States , where she was to live for the rest of her life . Had she wished , Katharine might have led a sheltered life devoted to esoteric literary writing , the translation of the works of noted French authors , particularly Balzac , to whom she devoted herself from the early eighties until her death , or correspondence with Thackeray and other writers and leaders of European society with whom she hobnobbed while still living in England . She was in Paris at the time of Napoleon 's second funeral , which she described vividly later in Napoleon 's Return from Helena , published in 1908 by Putnam . But Katharine Wormeley loved her fellow man too much to exclude herself from even the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested itself in her Civil War work and in the responsible part she played in the activities of numerous charitable organizations , especially those which dealt with the work of women and girls and their instruction in domestic science . She founded the Girls ' Industrial School at Newport , Rhode Island , and bore its expense for three years , after which it was taken over by the public school system . When the Civil War began , Katharine associated herself with the work of the United States Sanitary Commission , which she liked to describe as " an organization of private gentlemen ' whose voluntary and unpaid services were accepted by the govThe // ernment at the beginning of the War of the Rebellion to supply the deficiencies of the Medical Department of the army . " During General George McClellan 's Peninsula Campaign in 1862 , she served on hospital transports , joining the service on the second voyage of the Daniel Webster . Newport , R. I. , April 27 , 1862 . The Sanitary Commission has today sent off from Washington a large steamship to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down in her with Mr. Olmsted , and by his request . I have great cofidence in her . She is a lady whose presence is guarantee enough that I , or any other woman , may go there with propriety . She is very efficient , and I should be satisfied in working under her . . . . I have written to her to send for me if they want me ; the letter went yesterday . . . . My work here is closing . Colonel Vinton Quartermaster General in New York sends me today the flannel for the last ten thousand shirts , which closes my present contract ; I have just drained the community dry as to hospital supplies , and the churches have lately sent in $1,800 ( making $5,500 which I have received since we began in April , 1861 ) . May 7 . I received a telegram from Mrs. Griffin today , telling me that the Daniel Webster steamship had arrived at New York with the first load of sick and wounded , and that if I wish to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow morning . So I leave tonight . Have telegraphed you to that effect . U. S. Floating Hospital Daniel Webster , Off Ship Point , May 10 . We left New York yesterday at 5 P.M. , and . . . stayed on deck 1 ) y moonlight till eleven o'clock , when I turned in , to sleep all // night , and get up lazily to breakfast at nine this morning . Since then I have helped to make our hospital flag , and I have dreamed away the day , lying on deck in the sweet air , where I could see the bluest sky and the bluest water ( when the vessel dipped ) , and nothing else . Four ladies are attached to the ship . ... As far as I can judge , our duty is to be very much that of a housekeeper . We attend to the beds , the linen , the clothing of the patients ; we have a pantry and storeroom , and are required to do all the cooking for the sick , and see that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also to have a general superintendence over the condition of the wards and over the nurses , who are all men . What else , time and experience will show , I suppose . I am inclined to like the surgeon-in-charge , Dr. Grymes , very much . He commands here ; the captain , named Bletham ? a truly honest , kindly , sailor-like man ? being , under present circumstances , only second . Dr. Grymes is suffering from consump tion , and today he is hanging about , languid and nerveless ; they tell me that tomorrow he will be taut , tireless , hawk-eyed , and the spirit of an emergency . There are eight medical students on board ( " dressers , " they are called ) , and perhaps twenty other young men , wardmasters and nurses ? all volunteers . The Government furnishes the vessel , and the rations of all on board . My stateroom , which I share with Mrs. Griffin , is on deck ; it opens directly to the outer air , and has a large window and ventilator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beds . How you would have laughed to see me , without a hoop , mounted on the ledge of the second tier of berths , making the beds on the third tier . On May 12 , 1862 , Katharine Wormeley and the hospital staff f of the Daniel Webster were transferred to the Wilson Small where there were thirty-five badly wounded men ? four or five // amputations . Katharine took her first actual watch on the night of the 12th and felt adjusted to her work the following day . The patients were washed and given breakfast and then the surgeons and dressers made their rounds , opening the wounds , applying the remedies , and replacing the bandages . This was an awful hour . Katharine pressed her hands to her ears to shut out the cries of the men . When the surgeons had finished , the nurses put the wards in order once more . The Elm City , filled with wounded men , sailed this morning . The S. R. Spaulding , a large ocean steamship , is to be fitted up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Meantime , Georgy* has returned with another vessel , the Knickerbocker , in perfect order . It seems that the Quartermaster 's department ran away with the boat for some purpose of its own , carrying the ladies in her ? for Georgy is a lady . . . . They made the most of their time , and have brought back the runaway boat in perfect hospital order . I 've just been over her . They have had her cleansed . . . from the hold to the hurricane deck . The Knickerbocker is a large river steamboat , and is intended for surgical cases . Then they prepared the cots , mattresses , and bunks , and made the beds ; arranged every ward with all necessary appliances ; filled the linen closets with the proper quantity of bed linen , hospital clothing , socks , bandages , lint , rags , etc. , got ready the hospital kitchen , stole a stove for it , as far as I can make out , and had all the necessary stores unpacked and moved into places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be splendidly efficient . It is not the doing it , but the knowing how it should be done and handling the whole affair with as much ease as if they were arranging a doll 's house that delights me . We are all now sitting idly on carpetbags or on the floor , in a // little covered saloon or passage onto which our staterooms open . Our dinner table , the stove , is being removed , and Dr. Ware is improvising a better , with a plank across the railing of the stairs . The moment the pressure is taken off , we all turn to to be as funny as we can . I am astonished at the cheerful devotion ? whole-souled and whole-bodied devotion ? of the surgeon and medical students attached to this boat . These young men toil day and night at the severest work , quick , intelligent , and tender . Their business is to ship the men , move them carefully from one boat to another , and register their names and all their belongings ; to attend to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give medical and surgical attendance , dress the wounds , and often to sit up all night , after working hard all day . Then they turn in wherever a mattress comes to hand , take a long sleep , and come out of it refreshed and full of fun ? in which we join until the next work comes , and then we are all fresh to work in cheerful concert together . This seems the best way to do the work ; nothing morbid comes of it , which is the danger . We are now making ready to run up the Pamunkey River as far as the advance of the army at Cumberland . This boat , the Wilson Small , is disabled . She was twice run into today , the second time by the huge Vanderbilt , which nearly demolished her . We are to be towed by the Knickerbocker ( for we ca n't even get up steam ) as far as West Point , where there is a shipyard . You must get a good map and follow us and the army ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with those of Porter and Sedgwick , are at Cumberland and New Kent CourtHouse . This is the right wing . The left is moving towards the Chickahominy at Bottom Bridge , where the enemy are supposed to be rallying for a stand . Meantime McDowell is coming down from Fredericksburg at last , Banks from the direction of Gordonsville , and perhaps Burnside may get up along the line of // the Petersburg Railway . The general opinion is that a fearful struggle will take place before Richmond . Alas ! But it is not a battle which destroys so many lives as it is the terrible decimating diseases brought on by exposure and hardships and the climate of marshes and watercourses . The majority of the cases of illness which I have seen were men who dropped exhausted from the army on its march , and had painfully made their way to the banks of creeks and rivers , where they were picked up by passing boats and brought down to us . A number of men who came today ( one lad who died almost immediately ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fever from exposure and fatigue afterwards . A telegram is just brought on board , saying that a hundred sick men are waiting at Bigelow 's Landing for transportation ; the telegram says , " They are dying in the rain . " This message is to the United States Medical officer at Yorktown ; but he seems to think the obvious thing to do is to hand it over at once to the Sanitary Commission . Mr. Olmsted is not on board ; when he is found I suppose we shall start . The Knickerbocker is all ready for three hundred men , and I think it likely we shall run up in her and be at work all night ; but nothing is too much with such efficiency as we have on board ? order , calmness , promptitude . I only wish we might be kept working together ... . Wilson Small , Sunday , June i , 1862 . I write amid the distant booming of cannon and the hourly arrival of telegrams from the scene of action . The battle* began yesterday afternoon . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attack was made on our weakest point , General Casey 's division , which is the advanced body on the Chickahominy . It was attacked on front and flank , and retreated ; but being reinforced by General Heintzelmann , the . // ground and a lost battery were recovered . The second telegram to Colonel Ingalls was written off by the operator on the envelope of your letter of the 26th ; I shall keep it as a souvenir . It says : " General Kearny has driven the enemy a mile at the point of the bayonet . General Heintzelmann is driving back the enemy . Prisoners , General Pettigru and several field and staff officers . " A little later , and we heard : " We are driving them before us at every point " ; and now the last word is , " Our victory is complete . " The wounded are pouring in . All our ships , except the Spaulding , are here . Even the Elm City , which started with five hundred sick for Yorktown at four o'clock this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumph for her hospital company ! The Commodore , a Pennsylvania boat , the Vanderbilt and Whilldin , Government boats , are full . The Knickerbocker filled up , before we left her , with three hundred men from Casey 's division ? a sad sight . We left her this afternoon , after the men were comfortably settled , in the hands of those who are to take her to Newport News , and came home here , Wilson Small , with all our belongings . Mrs. M. and Georgy went off soon after to fit up the Daniel Webster No. 2 . I am writing on our little afterdeck by the light of the moon . The shore resounds with cheering ; even the wounded are elated . All around me lie hundreds , well-nigh thousands , of the poor fellows . Noble boys ! Wilson Small , June 2 .

She had four hundred and seventy wounded men on board . We passed the night up to our elbows in beef tea , milk punch , lemonade , panada , etc . The men were comfortable . The surgeons let them , for the most part , have a night 's rest before their wounds were opened . Not so , however , on the State of Maine , where operations were going on all night ; the hideous sounds filling our ears even in the midst of our own press of work ....

Buchlin We succeeded in getting on board just as the boat pushed out into the river , where it again lay until morning , crowded to its fullest capacity . Upper and lower decks were packed with soldiers going to the front to fill the ranks which had been decimated by the late battles . The cabin was filled with officers , several of whom vacated sofas ? one of which each of us occupied during the night after rolling them closely together . Two other women ? one a State agent and the other in the employ of the Sanitary Commission , the latter from WilliamsThe // burg , New York ? made them each a bed close together on the floor , while the officers lay around like sheep in a packed fold . Many persons were ill , and the suffocating atmosphere increased the distress until the suffering was general . On the afternoon of the third day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been the home of Gen. Fitz Hugh Lee , son of the Rebel commander , and under its roof Gen. Washington was married ? therefore much interest was associated with it in my mind . All that remained of it now were two stacks of blackened chimneys , and a row of Negro huts made of hewn logs , standing on the brink of the river . The narrow river , with its ragged banks , was somewhat like a city harbor , being filled with boats of every description . It was necessary in making a landing to lay planks from one boat to another ? and over these we walked , to the extent of half the width of the river , to the thronged shore . On the ground men and mules lay together asleep ? the mules still in the harness , lying forward on their knees ? the soldiers with their trusty guns beside them . They had been walked over , till the dust half-covered them ; some so deeply that their heads only were visible , and they crawled up upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . The huge army wagons , still attached to the creatures , were loaded with all manner of supplies , and underneath and about them many lay sleeping amid the noise and confusion ... . Between five and six hundred contrabands ? old , young , male , and female ? cannon , cattle , prisoners of war , and squads of soldiers added to the strangeness of the scene . Some were running with tents , others with the pole ; some with a box of crackers , others with a piece of pork ; some gathering sticks for a fire , others boiling their coffee ? and each intent on his own peculiar errand . Mr. Shafer , the gentleman who had come on from Washing170 Noble Women of the North ton in our company , tried vainly for two hours to procure a conveyance to take us nurses up to the hospital ground , which lay a mile and a half away . Each one was for himself , and cared little for those less fortunate . Everything was strongly guarded , in fear of lurking Rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor , where a battle had been fought only a day or two previous .... - We reported to the surgeon for duty , and he said , if possible , a tent should be put up for us ? so we sat down on the grass till the chill of evening was upon us . A night in the open air , without even a blanket to cover us , seemed inevitable . When I had settled it thus in my mind and nerved myself to endure it with all the fortitude of my soul , I saw the welcome face of one of our stewards , whom I had known at Camp Stoneman . Never was a faithful friend greeted with greater joy . After learning of our forlorn condition , he said , " I am going down to the landing , and , if I can get them by any means , I will bring each of you a blanket . " Before the sun 's last rays streaked up into the darkening sky we had a tent erected , and , shivering with cold , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl under its white wings , and try to sleep . Presently we heard a scratch on the canvas ( which answers to a rap on a civilized house-door ) , and , following it , came a blanket for each of us , from generous hands . We were without supper ? the supplies not having arrived yet ? and tired , cold , and hungry , we rolled ourselves up in our new , clean blankets , and , with our satchels under our heads , lay down to rest on the bare ground . I had lain on the uncovered slats of a Government bedstead , on straw , on husks , on shavings , and on the bare floor , but never before on the ground , which was chilly with the heavy fall of dew . Rebels were on every hand ; we knew not at what moment // they might dash down through our pickets , on whom we distinctly heard them firing at intervals ... . We knew we must have relief soon , or we should be rendered unfit for the duty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long we must wait for government supplies . Presently , in the stillness of the bright morning , I heard the sound of a hammer , and looking out across a little creek , which ran babbling through the tall , dewy grass , I saw another tent going up , and the familiar face of Mrs. Brainard , Michigan State agent , appeared very close by it . I had known her at Gettysburg , and knew that we would not apply to her for relief in vain . I called upon her and stated our failure to obtain food from the Sanitary Commission . She said , " Our table is spread , and the delegates are now breakfasting ? come in , and partake of what we have . " And it seemed a feast as she named over good soft bread and butter , raw ham , and plenty of tea and coffee . " You are welcome to eat here until your supplies come , " she added , as I departed with the glad tidings to my tentmates . We were waiting for our work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government kitchen was going up ; a dispensary was being erected and the medicines arranged in their proper places ; the commissary was getting the hospital supplies ready for use ; boxes of bandages were opened , and the hurry of preparation was on every hand . Tents were being spread , and the ambulances came upon the field with their ghastly , bloody freight ? unloading them , dying and groaning under the sun ? the small number of tents being entirely insufficient to shelter the constantly arriving throngs . Equipped for labor , with a box of bandages , a box of lint , adhesive plaster , sponge , shears , and chloroform , we went out to begin our labor of mercy , and found them lying in every imaginable position on the bare ground . Men were in attendance // to bring us the water , with which to wash the gore from the lacerated bodies . We worked under the scorching sun from early morn till late at night , the ambulances still bringing them in steadily . I never beheld any worse sights than here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as distressing wounds , but the awful circumstances which heightened the distress of the wretched , dying men had never been more glaringly presented to my sight before . Men lay all around me , who had been left for days on the battleground , wet with the dews of night , disfigured with powder and dirt , with blood oozing from their torn flesh , and worms literally covering the festering wounds ? dying with thirst , starving for food , unable to attend to nature 's wants , groaning in delirious fever , praying to die , to be rid of the intense pain which wracked the poor body . Such dreadful suffering I hope never to witness again . The field was one vast plain of intense mortal agony , tortured by the sun , and chilled by the night dews . Everywhere were groans and cries for help ; everywhere were the pleading and glassy eyes of dying men who were speechless in the delirium of death . It was a scene to appall the stoutest hearts , but the excitement nerved us to shut our senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . The dead lay by the living ; the dying groaned by the dead , and still one hundred ambulances poured the awful tide in upon us . We soon had our quarters arranged quite comfortably . A stove , bedsteads , straw ticks , with one blanket , and a table made by driving sticks into the ground and laying boards upon them , completed the inventory of our tent furniture . We also had a boy detailed to cook for us . . . . We dreaded the nights , for we lay , through the dark hours , insufficiently protected from the cold , yet knowing there were // hundreds of wounded in the open air who had far less covering than we . The Sanitary and Christian Commissions were on the ground at work ... . The cry for food was the standing one in the hastily constructed field hospitals ... . I FOUND GENERAL KEARNY IN THE THICKEST OF THE FIGHT Sarah Emma Edmonds Assuming another one of her many roles , Emma Edmonds ( Franklin Thompson ) describes the dramatic fashion in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Battle of Fair Oaks . At this time I was in military uniform , mounted upon my Rebel horse , and was acting orderly for General K.* Several aides and orderlies had been sent with messages and dispatches , but no reinforcements had yet arrived , and , taking a Federal view of it , the picture presented a gloomy appearance . General K. reined in his horse abruptly , and taking from his pocket an envelope , he hastily wrote on the back of it with a pencil : " In the name of God bring your command to our relief , if you have to swim in order to get here ? or we are lost . " Handing it to me , he said , " Go just as fast as that horse can carry you to General G. , t present this with my compliments , return immediately , and report to me . " I put poor little Reb over the road at the very top of his speed until he was nearly white with foam , then plunged him into // the Chickahominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. about a hundred rods from the river making the best of his way toward the bridge . Engineers were at once set to work strengthening the crazy structure , which was swaying to and fro with the rushing tide . The eager , excited troops dashed into the water waist deep , and getting upon the floating planks went pouring over in massive columns . I preferred to swim my horse back again rather than risk myself upon such a bridge , for I looked every moment to see it give way and engulf the whole division in the turbid waters of the swollen creek . However , all reached the other side in safety , and started along the flooded road on the double quick . This was cheering news to carry back to General K. , so I started again for the field in order to claim the reward of " him who bringeth good tidings . " I found General K. in the thickest of the fight , encouraging his men and shouting his orders distinctly above the roar and din of battle . Riding up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just returned , sir . General G. , with his command , will be here immediately . " It was too good to keep to himself , so he turned to his men and shouted at the top of his voice , " Reinforcements ! reinforcements ! " then swinging his hat in the air he perfectly electrified the whole line as far as his voice could reach , and the glorious word " reinforcements " was passed along until that almost exhausted line was reanimated and inspired with new hope . While I was thus watching with delight the effects of this joyful news upon the soldiers , my attention was directed to another object . General I-I. , * who had made himself conspicuous by his gallant conduct , was struck by a ball which shattered his arm badly . He was only a few rods from me and there was none near to help him . I asked General K. if I might go to him , leaped from my horse , and hitched him near by . I then removed the clothing from his arm , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went to my saddlebags to get some bandages , when my Rebel pony laid hold of my arm with his teeth and almost tore the flesh from the bone . Not content with that , he turned his heels in an instant and kicked with both feet , sending me about a rod . My arm was now almost as bad as General H. 's , and I could do but little to help him , for in ten minutes it was swollen terribly , and I could not raise to it my head ; finally I was ordered back to an old sawmill about a mile and a half from the field , where were considerable quantities of quartermaster 's and commissary stores , with orders to have them removed further to the rear ; and all who were able to come to the front , together with the surgeon and a portion of the hospital corps who had been left there in charge of the sick , were to lose no time in reporting themselves for duty on the field . Upon arriving at the old sawmill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there from the battlefield , to have their wounds dressed if possible , and if not to lie down and suffer where the shot and shell could not reach them . I delivered my orders . In a few moments more there was not a soul left to minister to those poor fellows who were huddled together in that mill by the score ; all had gone to the front , and I was left there in a sad plight . I put my vicious little Reb in a building near the mill , where there was plenty of hay and corn , but did not dare to unsaddle him . I then examined the extent of the injury done to my arm , and found it was worse than I had supposed . It was badly mangled by the horse 's teeth , and in one place a large piece of flesh was torn from the arm and hung by small shreds . But the arm was not the worst ; he had kicked me in the side , which had lamed and bruised me sadly . Yet this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , when so many lay around me with shattered limbs and ghastly saber wounds , some of them even now in the very agonies of death . I bound up my arm in a sling , // and set about removing the blood-clotted clothing from the wounds of those who needed it most ; but having neither knife or scissors , I was obliged in many instances to use my teeth in order to tear the thick woolen garments stiffened and saturated with blood , the very remembrance of which now makes me feel rather uncomfortable in the gastric region ; but then there was no unpleasant sensation . The next thing to be thought of was , how I could procure some bandages . . . . There were two houses within a mile , and I decided to try my fortune in that direction . First of all I went among the sick , who were left there by the surgeon , and inquired if there were any who were able to assist me in dressing wounds . Yes , I found two ; one a little mail-carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom were scarcely able to stand alone . These two set to work pouring cold water upon the wounded limbs occasionally , and giving the men water to drink until I returned . At the first house I went to they would not let me in at all , but raised the window and wished to know what was wanted . I told them , anything that would admit of tearing up for bandages . No , they had nothing of the kind , and closed the window again . I limped along to the next house . A man came to the door , holding it , to prevent my attempting to get in . The same question was asked , and a similar answer returned . By this time my patience and strength were both exhausted , and my mind was made up with regard to the course I should pursue . Therefore , drawing both my pistols from my belt , I demanded some cotton , new or old ? sheets , pillow-cases , or any other article which would answer the purpose for bandages . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know if she could let me have anything of the sort ; yes , she could , if I would pay her for it ; and of course I was willing to pay her ; so she brought me an old sheet , a pair of pillow-cases , and three yards of new // factory cotton cloth , for which she demanded five dollars . Happening to have only three dollars in change , I told her I thought that would be sufficient ; and so saying , I left immediately . I did not know , until I had proceeded some distance , that the blood was running from my arm in a perfect stream . In my excitement and determination , I had grasped one of my pistols with the lame hand and started those terrible gashes bleeding afresh . I grew faint and dizzy , and sat down by the roadside to gather a little strength , before proceeding further ... . I made my way slowly toward the mill . . . . The wounded were coming in faster than ever , and I was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind up some of the poor mangled limbs , the little sick sergeant being my right-hand man ... . All that weary night my heart burned with indignation , and I seemed endowed with supernatural powers of endurance , for when morning came and found me still at my post , without having tasted food for twenty-four hours , I felt stronger and fresher than I had done the day before . My two young sick friends had been persuaded to lie down , and were now fast asleep , side by side with the wounded . Night brought a cessation of hostilities to the weary troops , but to neither side a decided victory or defeat . Both armies bivouacked on the bloody field , within a few rods of each other . There they lay waiting for the morning light to decide the contest . The excitement and din of battle had ceased ; those brief hours of darkness proved a sweet respite from the fierce struggle of the day , and in the holy calm of that midnight hour , when silence brooded over the blood-washed plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , the first of June , dawned beautifully , a day of hallowed rest and promise to the millions who rose to their devotions , ere the bell called them to the house of prayer , but not of rest to the weary , broken armies // the drum-beat called from their wet and muddy beds to renew the contest . At a quarter past seven o'clock the battle again commenced , and raged fiercely until about noon . Both armies fought with determination and heroic bravery until the Rebels were compelled to yield , and victory once more perched upon the banners of the National troops . I came on the field about ten o'clock , and remained until the close of the battle , but could do little more than look upon the terrible scene . General McClellan was on the field when I arrived . I saw him ride along the entire battle front , and if I had not seen him , I could not have long remained in ignorance of his presence ? for the cheers from all parts of the Federal lines told as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , amid that desperate struggle for victory . It was a terrible slaughter ? more than fifteen thousand lay upon the field . It was enough to make angels weep , to look down upon that field of carnage . The dead and wounded of the enemy fell into the hands of the Unionists , which added fearfully to the labors of that exhausted , battle-worn army . On the evening of the third of June , General McClellan issued the following address to his troops , which was read on dress parade , and was received with tremendous cheering : " Soldiers of the Army of the Potomac ! I have fulfilled at least a part of my promise to you . You are now face to face with the Rebels , who are held at bay in front of their capital . The final and decisive battle is at hand . Unless you belie your past history , the result can not be for a moment doubtful . If the troops who labored so faithfully at Yorktown , and fought so bravely , and won the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fair Oaks , now prove themselves worthy of their antecedents , the victory is surely ours . The events of every day prove your superiority ; wherever you have met the enemy , // you have beaten him ; wherever you have used the bayonet , he has given way in panic and disorder . " I ask of you , now , one last crowning effort . The enemy has staked his all on the issue of the coming battle . Let us meet him , crush him here , in the very center of the rebellion . Soldiers ! I will be with you in this battle , and share its dangers with you . Our confidence in each other is now founded upon the past . Let us strike the blow which is to restore peace and union to this distracted land . Upon your valor , discipline , and mutual confidence , the result depends . " Every battle fought on the Peninsula fearfully reduced the strength of the Army of the Potomac , and proved a demonstration that the enemy far outnumbered the Union forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily urgent dispatches to the President and Secretary of War , and the great impending battle in front of the Rebel Capital so near at hand . The next day McClellan sent another dispatch , as follows : " Please inform me at once what reinforcements , if any , I can count upon having at Fortress Monroe or White House , within the next three days , and when each regiment may be expected to arrive . It is of the utmost importance that I should know this immediately . The losses in the battle of the thirty-first and first will amount to seven thousand . Regard this as confidential for the present . After the losses in our last battle , I trust that I shall no longer be regarded as an alarmist . I believe we have at least one more desperate battle to fight . " The day after the battle of Fair Oaks , a splendid sword was presented to me . It had been struck from the hand of a Rebel colonel , while in the act of raising it to strike one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how proud I felt of that beautiful silver-mounted trophy , from the bloody field of Fair // Oaks , which had so recently been wielded by a powerful arm , but powerless now , for he lay in the agonies of death , while his splendid sword had passed into my feeble hands . I presume if he had known this , it would have added another pang to his already agonized spirit . The sword was presented by General K. , * to whom I gave my Rebel pony , with the comforting assurance that he was only intended for ornament , and not for use ; for generals were too scarce on the Peninsula to risk their precious lives by coming in contact with him . The General was delighted with him , and without paying the slightest attention to my suggestion deliberately walked up to the pony and commenced patting him and handling his limbs as if he were the most quiet creature in the world , while Reb stood eyeing his new master with apparent satisfaction , and seemed to rejoice that he had passed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored bearer of shoulder straps . After thoroughly examining him he said : " He is certainly a splendid horse , and worth three hundred dollars of any man 's money ; all he requires is kind treatment , and he will be as gentle as any one could desire . " But Reb very soon gave him to understand decidedly that he was overrating his good qualities ; for no sooner had the General turned his back toward him that he struck him between the shoulders with both hind feet , sending him his full length upon the ground ; and as soon as he attempted to rise he repeated the same performance until he had knocked him down four or five times in succession . By that time the General was pretty thoroughly convinced that Reb 's social qualities were somewhat deficient , his bump of combativeness largely developed , and his gymnastics quite impressive . // ESCAPING FROM STONEWALL JACKSON Eliza Woolsey Howland Eliza writes her husband the latest news of the Hospital Transport Service while ashore at White House .

An orderly from Brigade Headquarters brought word from Captain Hopkins that Joe was ill and unable to write . I at once put up a basket of stores for him . . . to go by the orderly , and Charley telegraphed Generals Slocum and Franklin to know the truth , while Mr. Olmsted arranged with Captain Sawtelle for a pass to take me to the front tomorrow morning . My mind was relieved , however , by the telegraphic answers and better accounts , and I have given up the idea of going out . June 25 .

Running away down the Pamunkey again as fast as we can go , escaping from Stonewall Jackson ! All night the wood choppers were at work cutting down the woods at White House ( Landing ) to give the gunboats a chance to command the land beyond , and just now as we passed the banks were shorn and the pretty little place laid bare . The pickets had been driven in , and Jackson was supposed to be close at hand . Eighty wounded were brought down last night and put on board the Knickerbocker . Twelve more and a few sick came down this morning ... . The rumor today is that all communication with the front is stopped to conceal an advance of our army . June 28 .

There we lay through the evening and night , watching for the flames of burning stores at White House which did not burn , and for booming of guns which did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we turned and ran up the river again in search of both . Near Cumberland we met the Arrowsmith with Surgeon Vollum on board , who hailed us and told us of all we yet know of yesterday 's action at the front .

News that Joe Howland had been wounded reached Eliza and Georgy at White House ; the accident had occurred during the Battle of Gaines 's Mill on June 27 , the first of the terrible Seven Days ' Battle before Richmond . The Staff J Surgeon at Army Headquarters had wired that " Colonel Howland has a slight flesh wound . He is in my tent and will be taken good care of until he can be sent down . " At almost the same moment communications with the front were cut . The Rebels were advancing . General Stoneman sent in word that they were in sight .

So we steamed away watching the moving of the last transports , and the Canonicus ( Headquarters boat for the army officers at White House ) with Colonel Ingalls , Captain Sawtelle , and General Casey and staff . The most interesting thing was the spontaneous movement of the slaves who , when it was known that the Yankees were running away , came flocking from all the country about , bringing their little movables , frying pans , old hats , and bundles to the riverside . There was no appearance of anxiety or excitement among them . Fortunately there was plenty of deck room for // them on the forage boats , one of which as we passed seemed filled with women only , in their gayest dresses and brightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horticultural show . The black smoke began to rise from the burning stores on shore ( fired to keep them from the enemy ) , and now and then the roar of the battle came to us , but the slave women were quietly nursing their children and singing hymns . . . . All night we sat on the deck of the Small , watching the constantly increasing cloud of smoke and the fireflashes over the trees toward the White House as we moved slowly down the river . FOR GOD 'S SAKE , GIVE US BREAD Eliza Harris There seem to be no limits to the panegyrics employed by nineteenth-century biographers when extolling womanhood and the weakness of the weaker sex . Eliza Harris of Philadelphia was said to be pale and delicate , yet proved able to work like a horse when her services were needed . A woman of refinement and education , she was the wife of Dr. John Harris , a " somewhat eminent physician " in Philadelphia , and lived in comfort . " She seemed to be one of those least fitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but goes on to say that " beneath that quiet and frail exterior there dwelt a firm and dauntless spirit . " It took a dauntless spirit to travel aboard the Government transport Vanderbilt , which brought the wounded from the bloody field of Fair Oaks . Mrs. Harris went as the agent for the Philadelphia Aid Society , which had been organized on April 26 , 1861 . Although she was secretary of the Society , she preferred to work in the field and distribute the supplies they // sent to her . Mrs. Harris 's stay on the Vanderbilt was unexpectedly prolonged , as the officers were not able to get the necessary supplies on board . Mrs. Harris witnessed the removal of the wounded from the battlefield of Fair Oaks to the Vanderbilt . There were eight hundred on board . Passageways , staterooms , floors from the dark and fetid hold to the hurricane deck were all more than filled ; some on mattresses , some on blankets , others on straw ; some in the death struggle , others nearing it , some already beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been brought from the battlefield of the Sabbath previous , and all hungry and thirsty , not having had anything to eat or drink , except hard crackers , for twenty-four hours . The gentlemen who came on with us hurried on to the White House , and would have had us go with them , but something held us back ; thank God it was so . Meeting Dr. Cuyler , Medical Director , he exclaimed : " Here is work for you ! " He , poor man , was completely overwhelmed with the general care of all the hospitals at Old Point , and added to these , these mammoth floating hospitals , which are coming in from day to day with their precious cargoes . Without any previous notice , they anchor , and send to him for supplies , which it would be extremely difficult to improvise , even in our large cities , and quite impossible at Old Point . " No bakeries , no stores , except small sutlers . " The bread had all to be baked ; the boat rationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went aboard , the first cry we met was for tea and bread . " For God 's sake , give us bread , " came from many of our wounded soldiers . Others shot in the face or neck begged for liquid food . With feelings of a mixed character , shame , indignation , and sorrow blending , we turned away to see what resources we could muster to meet the demand . A box of tea , a barrel of cornmeal , sundry parcels of dried fruit , a few crackers , // ginger cakes , dried rusk , sundry jars of jelly and of pickles , were seized upon , soldiers and contrabands impressed into service , all the cooking arrangements of three families appropriated , by permission , and soon three pounds of tea were boiling , and many gallons of gruel blubbering . In the meantime , all the bread we could buy , twenty-five loaves , were cut into slices and jellied , pickles were got in readiness , and in an incredibly short time , we were back to our poor sufferers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter were outstretched , and the cry , " Give us a piece , 0 please ! I have had nothing since Monday " ; another , " Nothing but hard crackers since the fight , " etc . When we had dealt out nearly all the bread , a surgeon came in , and cried , " Do please keep some for the poor fellows in the hold ; they are so badly off for everything . " So with the remnant we threaded our way through the suffering crowd , amid such exclamations as " Oh ! please do n't touch my foot , " or , " For mercy 's sake , do n't touch my arm " ; another , " Please do n't move the blanket ; I am so terribly cut up , " down to the hold , in which were not less than one hundred and fifty , nearly all sick , some very sick . It was like plunging into a vapor bath , so hot , close , and full of moisture , and then in this dismal place , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seized upon with avidity . And here let me say , at least twenty of them told us next day that the pickles had done them more good than all the medicine they had taken . The tea was carried all around in buckets , sweetened , but no milk in it . How much we wished for some concentrated milk . The gruel , into which we had put a goodly quantity of wine , was relished , you can not know how much . . . . After hours spent in this way , we returned to the Hygeia Hospital , stopping on our way to stew a quantity of dried fruit , which served for supper , reaching the Hygeia wet through and through , every garment saturated . Disrobed , and bathing with bay rum , was glad to lie down , every // bone aching , and head and heart throbbing , unwilling to cease work where so much was to be done , and yet wholly unable to do more . There I lay , with the sick , wounded , and dying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds falling upon my ear being groans from the operating room . Two days afterward I was on the Knickerbocker , one of the Sanitary Commission transports , and headed for White House Landing , where , with Miss Charlotte Bradford , I spent the whole night on the transport Louisiana looking after the wounded . When I left the boat at eleven o'clock the next night , I was obliged to wash all my skirts as they were saturated with the mingled blood of the Union and Confederate soldiers which covered the floor as I kneeled to wash their faces . I had torn up all my spare clothing for bandages and compresses . I SEE SOMETHING WHITE AMONG THE TREES Katharine P. Wormeley The Battle of Malvern Hill to which Katharine Wormeley refers in this letter to her mother was the violent concluding engagement of the Seven Days ' Battle . Off Berkley , Harrison 's Bar , James River , Tuesday , July 1 , 1862 . We arrived here yesterday to hear the thunder of the battle and to find the army just approaching this landing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dusty plain . The feelings with which we came up the James River I ca n't describe , our anxiety , excitement , and breathless desire to know something were so great . Not a vessel was in sight after we left Newport News , except the Canonicous , Quartermaster 's Department boat , // which was just ahead of us . No one could guess what knowledge any moment might bring to us . We were just admiring a fine old colonial house , when someone standing in the bows cried out : " I see something white among the trees to the right ! " and in a few minutes more we made them out to be army wagons . We had met our army ! What next were we to learn ? Never shall I forget the look of the first officers who came on board ? one a major , the other a chaplain . They were gaunt and haggard , their hair stood out from their heads stiffened with dust and dirt , their faces were nearly black , and to their waists they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is this ? " we cried . " It is a defeat ? " " Defeat ! No , we have retreated , but we never turned our backs on them . We have faced and fought and beaten them for five days ! " Just as we arrived , General McClellan came down on the Galena to see Colonel Ingalls . Think what a relief it must have been to his anxious mind to learn the perfect success of our removal from White House , and to know that supplies were already here , and following us up the river , for his exhausted army ! I saw the gunboat he was on , but I did not see him ; and he was gone almost immediately ... . Wilson Small , Harrison 's Landing , July 3 . As I write I glance from time to time at the Army of the Potomac , massed on the plain before me ? an army driven from its position because it could not get reinforcements to render that position tenable ; forced every day of its retreat to turn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ; and yet it comes in from seven days ' fighting , marching , fasting , in gallant spirits , and making the proud boast for itself and its commander that it has not only marched with its face backward to the // enemy , but has inflicted three times the loss it has borne , and that the little spot of its refuge rings with its cheers . And yet the sad truth can not be concealed : our position is very hazardous . What I hear said is such as this : " Unless we have reinforcements , what can we do ? Must McClellan fight another bloody battle in a struggle for life , or surrender ? Give us reinforcements , and all is well . We have got the right base now . We could not have it at first ; we made another ; that other the Government made it impossible for us to maintain . Day by day we saw it growing untenable . We now have the true base of operations against Richmond . The sacrifice ? Yes ! but who compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANDING Katharine P. Wormeley After the Army of the Potomac was driven from its position because it could not get reinforcements in the Battle of Malvern Hill , Katharine wondered if McClellan would have to fight another battle " in a struggle for life or surrender . " He had the right base now for operations against Richmond . " Give us reinforcements , " Katharine wrote , " and all is well . " She appears convinced that a " strong pull and pull together " would end the rebellion . On July 4 , 1862 , while aboard the Wilson Small , she learned of Lincoln 's call for thirty thousand men and on the 8th the President came to Harrison 's Landing to look over the situation himself . For the last two hours I have been watching President Lincoln and General McClellan as they sat together in earnest conversation on the deck of a steamer close to us . I am thankful , I am happy , that the President has come ? has sprung across that // dreadful intervening Washington , and come to see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While we were at dinner someone said , chancing to look through a window : " Why , there 's the President ! " and he proved to be just arriving on the Ariel , at the end of the wharf close to which we are anchored . I stationed myself at once to watch for the coming of McClellan . The President stood on deck with a glass , with which , after a time , he inspected our boat , waving his handkerchief to us . My eyes and soul were in the direction of general headquarters , over where the great balloon was slowly descending . Presently a line of horsemen came over the brow of the hill through the trees , and first emerged a firm-set figure on a brown horse , and after him the staff and bodyguard . As soon as the General reached the head of the wharf he sprang from his horse , and in an instant every man was afoot and motionless . McClellan walked quickly along the thousand-foot pier , a major general beside him , and six officers following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which I distinguished him as the little group stepped onto the pier . When he reached the Ariel he ran quickly up to the afterdeck , where the President met him and grasped his hand . I could not distinguish the play of his features , though my eyes still ache with the effort to do so . He is stouter than I expected , but quicker , and more leste . He wore the ordinary blue coat and shoulder straps ; the coat , fastened only at the throat , and blowing back as he walked , gave to sight a gray flannel shirt and a ? suspender ! They sat down together , apparently with a map between them , to which McClellan pointed from time to time with the end of his cigar . We watched the earnest conversation which went on , and which lasted till 6 P.M. ; then they rose and walked side by side ashore ? the President in a shiny black coat and stovepipe hat , a whole head and shoulders taller , as it seemed to me , than the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General 's , and together they rode off , the staff following , the dragoons presenting arms and then wheeling round to follow , their sabres gleaming in the sunlight . And so they have passed over the brow of the hill , and I have come to tell you about it . The cannon are firing salutes ? a sound of strange peacefulness to us , after the angry , irregular boomings and the sharp scream of the shells to which we are accustomed ... . MOTHER CAN NOT STAND THE ANXIETY MUCH LONGER Abby Howland Woolsey 8 Brevoort Place , Saturday , July 5 , ' 62 . Georgy 's and Charley 's letters from Harrison 's Landing have just arrived , the last date being a postscript Thursday , July 3 , which brings us into close correspondence again , you see . These letters have relieved the painful anxiety that began to possess us , about Joe 's condition and whereabouts . We thought perhaps that if his wound were really slight , he had been tempted to rejoin the regiment , and had shared in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother says that if it is Charley 's desire to stay a little while longer , she consents ; he is evidently so useful that she should not have the heart to insist on his coming back . As for Georgy , if you leave her behind , we shall never forgive you . She must come . Mother can not stand the anxiety much longer , nor can Georgy bear the constant strain . By-andby , perhaps , if necessary , she could go back ; now she must come home with you . We should be better pleased to have Charley and all once more together , at the end of this battle year , and before we all begin on other years of separation and distress . Have C. come too . Poor , poor Colonel Marsh ! Mortally wounded at Gaines 's Mill . What a mercy it would have been
