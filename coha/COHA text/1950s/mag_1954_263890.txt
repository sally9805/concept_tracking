At Newport , the weathering old mansions of the rich still brood by the sea , and outsiders half expect to meet ladies in ankle-dusting tennis skirts escorted by blades in gaily banded boaters . But last week Newport 's narrow streets were thronged with loud-shirted bookie types from Broadway , young intellectuals in need of haircuts , crew-cut Ivy Leaguers , sailors , Harlem girls with extravagant hairdos and high-school girls in shorts . They were cats . From as far away as Kansas they had come to hear a two-day monster jazz festival . <P> The Newport wingding was further evidence that jazz is enjoying its biggest boom in years , with record sales soaring and nightclubs sprouting new jazz acts all over the country . A crowd of 6,000 fans jammed into Newport 's dingy old open-air Casino for the first-night concert . There was a clear moon overhead as Oldtimer Eddie Condon , a little ill at ease in all the fresh air , stamped his foot four times and swung into Muskrat Ramble , sweeping along his bang-up Dixieland outfit , including Clarinetist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Sutton . The music was hot , and the crowd warmed to it with shouts of " Go ! Go ! " <P> <P> Up to the Stars . From the oldtime start , the music came gradually up to date . Things really began to hum when Bop Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie took the stage with his quintet . Looking bemused and gesturing wildly , he set his cocked trumpet* to his lips and played Gabriel-like tones that sent chills up the listeners ' spines . " See , that 's a square bend , " he explained , pointing to the upswept angle . " Well , I get a sort of square note out of there . When you say ' Pow-w-w , ' it comes out like a pounding-like a pounding of bricks . ' ' <P> When Pianist Oscar Peterson and his trio gave a fast-fingered version of Tenderly sprinkled with suave dissonances , the modernist crowd was ready to call it the high point of the festival . But the younger set shrieked louder when hollow-cheeked Gerry Mulligan bellowed and coaxed The Lady Is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended after midnight with a 20-man jam session that sent the strangest sounds ever heard in Newport floating up to the stars . <P> In the Black . Next night there was another big concert in the Casino with a few other name combos ( e.g. , Pianists George Shearing , Erroll Garner , Lennie Tristano ) plus informal sessions that lasted till dawn . In the afternoon a slim crowd of cats had attended a forum about the origin and meaning of jazz . But the meaning of the festival itself seemed to be that jazz-whether Dixieland , bop or " modern " - more than ever has America 's ear . The festival wound up tidily in the black . <P> <P> *Specially constructed with its bell tilted upward at a 45-degree angle . Dizzy discovered the new twist after a party accident bent his horn . When he played it , he was amazed : " For the first time I heard myself play . "
