 | What a wonderful job can be done today , but what a lot of money is involved ! There ought to be more orthodontists Joanie 's upper teeth protrude slightly . They are n't causing her any trouble , but her mother does n't think she 's as pretty as she should be . So Joanie goes to the orthodontist , who works on her for two years and makes her pretty . Johnny 's upper teeth protrude quite a lot . His appearance is n't the only thing involved ; he 's having difficulty chewing . Could n't possibly eat an apple . for example . And he 's suffering from ridicule besides ; the kindest thing his schoolmates cal him is " Rabbitface . " So Johnny goes to the orthodontist too . and after two years he can chew properly . ( And what an improvement in his grades ! ) Johnny and Joanie are leading happier lives because the orthodontist ? a dentist who specializes in straightening teeth ? has become a shining light in modern dental science . With newly developed techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correcting buckteeth. undershot jaws . cleft palates. and similar malformations affecting the face and mouth . His work now helps adults as well as children , solves sociological problems as well as health difficulties . A schoolteacher who had her teeth straightened has become a better teacher ; she now thinks more about the lessons and less about how she looks to the children . A housewife had a gap between her two front teeth closed and found new popularity ; now she 's not afraid to smile , so people no longer consider her grim and sour . In fact it is now technically possible for practically anyone to escape the grief and ugliness caused by ill-formed teeth . There is only one trouble : The treatment costs so much ! On the surface there seems to be little justification in this day and age for one person 's having to grow up with an ill-formed jaw while another is getting the full benefit of orthodontic help . Yet for more than half of those who need it modern orthodontic treatment is hundreds of dollars beyond their reach . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so high as to ruin the family budget . How much does a tooth-straightening job cost ? It 's hard to name an exact figure . because so much of the price depends on how long the treatment must be maintained . To the orthodontist 's credit , it must be said that he is often able to help a patient quickly and without profit by advising that the work can safely be deferred or that some measure other than orthodontics ? such as extraction and dentures ? is the best solution to a particular problem . But assume that full-scale orthodontics is needed . If the parent is well-to-do , the orthodontist well known , and the locale a big city , an initial payment of $300 and a yearly fee during active treatment of $400 or $500 would not be unusual . In about two years the total would reach around $1,200 . ( Many cases in New York , however , cost much less than that , depending upon the severity of the case and the financial status of the patient . ) In Iowa , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 to $150 and the yearly fee during active treatment $150 to $200 . In Chicago it is not unusual to charge a flat fee , and the average has been estimated at $500 to $1,000 for the entire case . The national figures might be $125 to $250 initially and $240 to $360 per year , with two years the average time and $750 the average total . These estimates are for one patient . If a family needs several treatments concurrently , as may be required for two or more children , even the lowest rates , $150 to $200 per year , can be a great burden . @#  | Can anything be done to reduce this cost ? Obviously something must be done , because the right to have the benefits of this service will be demanded by everyone . Although not yet sufficient , some steps are being taken to improve the situation . Just what problems does the orthodontist solve that his services should cost so much ? If your own teeth are even and straight , or if your children 's are , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic conditions the orthodontist must try to correct . Jaws do not always grow at the proper rate . This may be a glandular defect : it may be the result of losing baby teeth too early . It can also be the result of keeping a baby tooth too long . Finding its own place usurped , the permanent tooth comes in behind or in front of the baby tooth . Whenever the proper space is not available , the new tooth will twist and turn and make room for itself somehow . Perhaps only this one tooth will be out of line , but often it will disarrange the whole row . The whole function of the teeth will then be disturbed by malocclusion -- the dentist 's name for an imperfect meeting of the teeth when you bite . Heredity can play tricks . A child may have Mother 's tiny teeth in Father 's massive jaw . Or it may have the impossible job of accommodating Father 's outsize teeth in the small arches inherited from the other side of the family . When we consider how prolonged thumb-sucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may push the tongue against the teeth ) can misshape our mouths and our destinies , we are better able to understand the seeming miracles wrought by an orthodontist in moving teeth through solid , living bone . He may use nothing more than a dab of rough cement , so placed that it entices your own tongue , in your own mouth , to press against your own front teeth . More often , however , metal or wire appliances ( popularly called " braces " ) must be worn for months or even years . Obviously these appliances must be designed and fitted with the utmost precision . If a light touch of your tongue can do so much damage , think how disastrous it could be to have hard metal pressing in the wrong direction ! ET us visit the orthodontist with Johnny , the boy who could n't eat an apple . The doctor studies Johnny 's face . He measures and records the proportions of Johnny 's teeth and jaws , assisted by both camera and X-ray studies taken fullface and in profile . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny 's mouth and makes plaster models of both jaws . He studies these models , perhaps putting them on an " articulator , " a device that lets him see how the teeth behave when Johnny chews . He decides which teeth must be repositioned , how and where they are to be moved , and whether there is space in the mouth for them . ( If not , he may recommend that certain teeth be drawn to make room . However , one school of  | orthodontists believes that no sound tooth should ever be extracted . ) If Johnny 's case is complicated , the doctor may discuss it with the study group of fellow orthodontists to which he belongs . Having decided what he wants to do , the doctor will decide on the proper appliances . He will go into the laboratory and make them . Finally ? this may be six or eight weeks from the time he first saw Johnny ? he will insert the appliances in Johnny 's mouth . Do n't forget , if you 're counting up the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must spend in conference with Johnny 's parents . This is when he outlines what he hopes to accomplish , tells approximately how long it will take , explains how important it is for Johnny to co-operate , briefs Mom on the job of seeing that Johnny does his part , and breaks the news to Dad about the fee . Johnny 's father will not expect to obtain this professional work for pennies , but neither will he relish the size of today 's probable fee . However , he must realize that the orthodontist is a specialist who has had at least fifteen months of postgraduate study in addition to courses in regular dentistry , and that this extra investment of time must be made worthwhile . THE bill-paying patient must also consider certain continuing expenses that the orthodontist pays out regularly as overhead . When the orthodontist tells you that his equipment and laboratory facilities are more expensive than those of the regular dentist , he 's right . He has to employ both a dental assist- ' ant and a secretary . The latter is usually necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not double as the usual dental secretary . The appliances the orthodontist uses are handmade with costly precision tools , not manufactured in quantity , and most of them are made of precious metals . These bands and arch wires are not large . altogether those needed for Johnny 's case would cost comparatively little , depending upon the type of appliance used and the material of which it is made , and also upon the frequency with which new appliances must be made during treatment . The orthodontist does not base his fee on the cost of these materials although they do add slightly to his overhead expenses . The patient pays the doctor for his skill and knowledge ; it is not the cost of the materials that makes this work expensive . Perhaps the greatest single reason fees are not lower is that the demand for service far exceeds the availability of service . Even in a huge metropolis like Chicago there are not enough orthodontists to fill the need . If they had more competition they undoubtedly would be obliged , even though unfairly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and better specialists , but not nearly so many as the country needs . In 1953 The American Dental Association 's Directory listed one orthodontist less than in 1952 ! The dental colleges do not have enough money , and their first obligation is to train dentists for general practice . The teaming of specialists and research is , of necessity , secondary . This shortage of orthodontists necessarily keeps fees high and leaves the field wide-open for less qualified men to grab for them by tackling problems that are not within  | their training and experience . Results may be disastrous : years of discomfort from wearing appliances that ca n't do any good , moving of teeth that leaves the condition worse than it was before , sometimes " criminal " extraction of sound teeth that should not have been sacrificed . Regardless of cost , however , high or low , parents should be urged to use every reasonable precaution to see that their children are in the hands of qualified orthodontists . A parent seeking advice should first go to his regular dentist or physician or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be competent . ( Or you might ask some person who has already received satisfactory orthodontic care . ) If there is no competent orthodontist in the vicinity , any doctor or dentist can get the names of the nearest orthodontists by writing to the secretary of the local or state dental society , who has , or can easily obtain at a cost of $3 , a copy of the Orthodontic Directory of the World , Suppose Johnny 's parents could n't afford even the lowest regular fee of the private orthodontist . What could they do about getting Johnny 's teeth and future straightened out a little ? There is no question about the first step : It is to tell the orthodontist what the problem is . Here is what one specialist has to say : " I have only one scale of fees , but I would never let any patient in real need of treatment go without hope of getting it ? if I knew his family 's circumstances . The difficulty is this : Parents bring their children to me and then ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , We 'll think it over . ' I may sense that they consider my fee beyond their means , but obviously I can not then offer to do it for less . If only they would tell me frankly that they can not afford my fee and explain their circumstances , I 'm sure that I , and many others too , would try to work something out for them . " Dental clinics are a partial solution , but the university clinics are able to accept only such patients as are valuable to them for teaching and research purposes . Even in university clinics the patient usually has to pay an average of $ 300 per case . The University of Illinois charges a flat fee of $150 , but the balance of the cost is subsidized by the University from various grants because accepted cases are of teaching value . At a clinic , of course , the actual work is done by students . But they are all graduate dentists ; they are closely supervised by experienced orthodontists ; and the head of the department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the top men in the country . The trouble is that the college clinics have more would-be patients than they can accept , for they must choose them for teaching purposes only . The University of Illinois , for example , usually accepts only about one out of five applicants . IF JOHNNY lives in Colorado , California , Delaware , or New York , and if his case is severe enough and his family income small enough , he may qualify for state aid . Ordinarily , state aid is confined to the kind of case that threatens the child 's health or future employability . However , New York 's realistic plan also recognizes mental hazards . Thus the $300,000 that the state spent this year to provide orthodontic service to 1,500 needy kids  | includes the cost of helping a delinquent girl who pointed to a single crooked tooth and told the psychiatrist , " I 'd rather die than go through life with this ! " Straightening that tooth will be a bargain if it saves the state the cost of straightening out one delinquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four ? not alone because of the help given individuals but because it will aid us in getting more trained orthodontists and in spreading them around to places where no service is now available . If Johnny lives in Washington , D. C. , and his parents are members of Group Health Associates , he 'll have available a service that is unique in the field . Group Health Associates is the kind of organization that has stirred wide controversy , hailed by some as the answer to the high cost of doctors and condemned by others as a dangerous kind of socialized medicine . The free services to members of the plan do not include dentistry , but Group Health maintains a dental suite where service , available at minimum fee , includes orthodontics ! The man who does the orthodontics work ( he is head of the entire dental department ) is a specialist . Yet we are told no case is undertaken without consultation ( at the outset , during treatment , and again when the work is concluded ) with an independent outside orthodontist . Group Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost ( $50 initial fee ; $5 per quarter hour of chair time thereafter ) . But it is significant that 125 of the current active cases ? considerably more than half ? are adults who feel that at last they can afford to have longstanding defects corrected . Similar in name , but different in setup , is Group Health Dental Insurance , Inc. , of New York , offering the first insurance policy against dental bills . Group Health Dental Insurance officers believe that their plan has licked the bugaboo that has always stood in the way of dental insurance ? what to do about cavities and other conditions that already exist : Healthy teeth are insured at the outset ; others are covered as soon as they have been fixed . One of the exciting things about the plan is that it offers free orthodontic service for all children who are enrolled before reaching their sixth birthday ! The insurance is n't cheap ( $72 per year for a family with minor children ) ; it is available only to employe groups ; the experiment is limited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is being closely watched , and if it succeeds it is likely to be adopted by other groups in other parts of the country . THERE are ways too for the watchful eye of parents and family dentist to save the orthodontist a lot of work and parents a lot of money . Even hereditary problems that can not be entirely avoided can be minimized if treatment is begun at the proper time . Parents should follow these hints : Take your child to a dentist regularly , beginning at age three . ( By this time half of all children are already in need of at least one filling ! ) Never take the shortsighted view that baby teeth are not worth dentistry . One tooth lost too early may start a chain reaction that will spoil the shape of your child 's face . Its absence may interfere with normal chewing . It may permit other teeth to move out of  | place , whereas a dentist can usually prevent this by inserting a device called a space-maintainer . Above all , take the child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a critical time . Watch out for habits that could be harmful : 1 . Mouth breathing . This may cause the upper jaw to narrow and protrude. 2 . Poor body posture . This often allows the lower jaw to sag , the lower lip and chin muscles to weaken . 3 . Improper swallowing . This may push the tongue forward against the teeth with every swallow . 4 . Biting of pencils , lip biting , and continued thumb-sucking past the age of four . These practices can cause crooked teeth by bringing continual pressure in the wrong direction . Generally speaking , thumb-sucking under the age of four does no harm to a child 's teeth . However , this habit at any age can be symptomatic of some underlying physical or emotional disturbance , and it is wisest to consult your doctor if your child shows any strong tendency toward it . In any event do not attempt any intensified corrective measures without the doctor 's sanction . None of the remedies now in effect , of course , alters the fact that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the costs today are prohibitively high . It would be unfair to castigate the orthodontics profession for this condition ; special skills deserve special compensation . Many orthodontists themselves wish more and more children could have complete service available . The problem is acute . Its chief solution at the moment seems to be in the proper training of more men , and certainly more women . The dental institutions may be most at fault . Generally speaking , they are not adequately equipped , financially or facultywise , to do the job that is required of them . If the American public protests enough , perhaps quick and substantial action may be taken by the trustees who guide the destinies of dental colleges and who must bear the burden of responsibility for current conditions .
