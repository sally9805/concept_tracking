Seldom does Manhattan 's sleek , sharp Representative Vito Marcantonio , a tireless party-liner , make much sense on the floor of the House . But last week , as a one-man minority , he had a chance to deliver a shrewd blow while he enjoyed the discomfiture of the two majority parties . " It is obvious to everybody , " he said , in his shrill and rasping voice , " that everybody wants civil rights as an issue but not as a law . That goes for Harry Truman , the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . " <P> All week long , the FEPC bill-to punish an employer for discrimination in hiring because of race or religion-was an issue , but it came no nearer to a vote . It was a performance that reflected little credit on either party , for both have endorsed FEPC in their platforms . Even before the debate began , Speaker Sam Rayburn of Bonham , Texas let it be known that he would do his considerable best to keep FEPC from reaching the House floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House rules ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) had not left the " right atmosphere " for another wrenching controversy . When FEPC came up , under the rules that Rayburn had successfully fought to retain only three days before , he decided that a more appropriate topic would be the statehood bills for Alaska and Hawaii . <P> Clocks &; Quorums . That was all the Dixiecrats needed to stop FEPC in its tracks . But just to be sure that the painful subject would n't be called up that day , anti-FEPC forces made six demands for quorums , each of which took up half an hour , and Mississippi 's John Rankin even rose to complain that the House clocks did not agree with each other . Republican leaders made no move to come to the rescue . Waddling out of a meeting of the Rules Committee next day , Ohio 's portly Republican Clarence Brown cheerfully admitted that he had voted with committee Dixiecrats to keep the bill from reaching the floor . Not that he was against FEPC , of course , he just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Also , " I wanted to protect the Speaker , " he added piously . <P> FEPC supporters made one more effort . Freshman Congressman Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . announced that he hoped to get a House majority-218 signatures-to a petition to pry the bill loose from committee . He was immediately sat upon by Manhattan 's Adam Clayton Powell , one of the two House Negroes and author of the FEPC bill .
