Republican leaders of every stripe raised a chorus of protest against the roughshod operations of Taft forces in Chicago . <P> Early in the week , as the Taft steamrollers picked up speed , 23 of the nation 's 25 Republican governors , in Houston for the annual Governors ' Conference , joined in signing a telegram to Republican National Committee Chairman Guy Gabrielson . They asked him to abandon the basic Taft convention tactic : the rule that once pro-Taft delegates from contested states are seated by the Taft-dominated national committee and credentials committee , they must be allowed to participate in any full convention vote on the seating of other contested delegations . Said the governors : " We believe that if contested delegations are permitted to vote on the seating of other contested state delegations , the Republican Party . . . will enter a vital and difficult campaign under a serious moral cloud . " <P> Next day , John Fine of Pennsylvania and Maryland 's Theodore R. McKeldin , the only Republican governors who did not attend the conference , announced that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Republicans who know how to get elected to executive office , both Gabrielson and Taft stuck to their guns . A reporter reminded Taft that the problem of voting by contested delegates was considered a moral issue by Utah 's J. Bracken Lee , one of the Ohio Senator 's three lonely supporters among Republican governors . Taft 's reply was typical of his whole campaign : He snapped : " Governor Lee is all wrong . " <P> Shortly after he reached Chicago from Houston , Governor Lee seemed to agree with Senator Taft 's statement about him . Lee and the two other Taft governors-Len Jordan of Idaho and Norman Brunsdale of North Dakota-repudiated the Houston statement that they had signed . Their delegations voted with Taft 's side in the rules fight . Said Lee : " The statement ... at Houston was signed ... to see that everything that was done was above reproach . But ... in fairness to everyone concerned , it is impossible for me to see how you can change long-established rules in the middle of the game . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral position stated by the governor . Said California 's Senator Richard Nixon : " The real issue is whether the Republican Party is to survive . . . whether the selection of the Republican candidate for President is to be determined by the will of the people or by a small clique of politicians who happen to control the party machinery . " <P> California 's Governor Earl Warren reminded Republicans that " a day of reckoning " would come in November . Michigan 's Dr. John Wood , a Republican delegate who had once supported Taft , was more specific : " If Taft is the nominee , I will still work for him , but it will be a losing fight .
