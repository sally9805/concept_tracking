txt 8o YOUR TRIP ABROAD though an interesting adjunct of the trip ? are secondary to the sailing itself . ) The Alcoa Steamship Company , an affiliate of the Aluminum Company of America , runs three beautiful small ships from New Orleans to Caribbean ports . Passage may be booked on a cruise basis , or oneway or round-trip to any of the ports of call . The American Republics Line operates three famous sister ships , the Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay , to Trinidad and the east coast of South America from New York , in cruise and regular transportation service . Largest in the Latin-American run , they 're 33,000-ton ships , accommodating 515 passengers in two classes . Three of the newest and finest ships to sail the Caribbean and Southern Atlantic are the Dcl Sud , Dcl Nortc , and Del Mar operated by the Delta Line from New Orleans to the cast coast of South America . Passengers arc carried iii luxury accommodations , one class . The Grace Line is the principal carrier to the west coast of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Santa Paula , are favorites with cruise passengers on their runs to Caribbean ports , but it also operates a fleet of six 5z-passenger cargo ships to Panama , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , and Chile , as well as three others of the same type on Caribbean runs . Life on shipboard is extremely pleasant , and generally quite uncomplicated , but you can make it even more pleasant and less complicated if you know beforehand a bit of what goes on and what to expect . The captain is the all-powerful being while your ship 's at sea , and like the Lord , he makes his presence felt everywhere without actually being seen very often . The captain is complete and absolute master of the ship , a benign dictator under whom the processes of democracy are suspended for the duration of the voyage in the interest of safety . He can marry you , bury you , or have you thrown into the brig . Supervising the voyage of a ship carrying as many as three thousand passengers and crew members , the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social fripperies , so you probably wo n't see him during the entire voyage , particularly if you 're sailing on one of the larger ships . A captain , sometimes , will invite some of his more famous passengers ? the film stars , financial tycoons , and top government officials ? to his quarters for cocktails , but that does n't mean he must attend when they try to reciprocate with parties of their own . What a shepherd is to his flock , an airline hostess to her passengers , a minister to his congregation , or the concierge of a French hotel is to his guests , so the purser is to you when you 're aboard ship . He 'll // change your money , sell and cash your travelers checks ( but not , usually , your personal checks ) , help you with customs and immigration documents , guard your family jewels in his safe , change your accommodations if necessary and possible , answer your questions , and help you with all your troubles . His office is centrally situated , usually opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting place whenever any business has to be transacted between you and the line . The purser , by the way , is never tipped , as he is an officer of the ship . Regular transatlantic passengers who cross frequently on the same ship will sometimes give the purser a present of some sort at Christmas time or at the end of a voyage , but it 's purely on a personal , friendly basis . Probably the next most important man on the ship for you , personally , will be the head dining steward , or ? on very large ships ? his assistant in charge of the section of the dining saloon in which you will be seated . He will assign your place , and if you 're unhappy with your table mates or want to sit with some new-found friends he 'll change your table , if possible . Prominent passengers are seated at the captain 's table or at the tables of other officers of the ship . Relax ? it ca n't be wangled , usually . Should your ship be heavily booked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal , and you will be asked to choose which you prefer . If you enjoy sleeping late I 'd recommend that you book for the second sitting ? otherwise you 'll find yourself having to get up early to be in time to make breakfast . Another reason why many passengers choose the second sitting is that they enjoy leisurely mealtime conversation , and first-sitting passengers are usually asked not to dawdle over their coffee , so that tables may be set promptly for the second sitting . And , finally , your predinner cocktail parties will be more fun if you do n't have to hurry to be ready for dinner . Advantages of the first-sitting are that you do n't have to wait very long for your meals ? with the maddening smell of food infuriating your ravenous appetite ? your evenings will be longer , and you 'll be in time for better seats at the movies . The deck steward is another member of the ship 's company you 'll get to know soon and well , and the sooner you get to know him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reserves your deck chair , brings you blankets , pillows , and magazines , comes around with trays of fruit juices , bouillon , and tea between mealtimes , and ? if you 're feeling so punko that the idea of going below to the dining saloon does n't appeal to you ? he 'll bring a snack to your deck chair , where you // can give him a weak , wan , but brave smile to arouse his sympathy , then wolf the food down when he 's gone away . The deck steward knows almost as many things about the naviga tion of deck chairs as the captain knows about piloting the ship . He can place your deck chair so that you 're shielded from the winds when they 're cold , or put it where you can get the benefit of cooling breezes when the weather 's hot . He can fix it so you can get a fine sun tan , or so that you 'll look like an end man in a minstrel show ? from smoke blowing all over you from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ventilators . He can pilot you into position next to the prettiest girl on the ship or place you to the windward of the worst ear-bender aboard . That 's why it 's a good idea to seek him out as early in the voyage as possible and reserve your deck chair , creating the im pression in his mind , meanwhile , by sonic subtle means , that you 're an eccentric millionaire who will do handsomely by him if he does right by you . ( Actually , you 'll pay him the regular charge of a couple of dollars or so for the rent of the chair , plus a tip of from one to three dollars . For more details on shipboard gratuities , see the chapter on tipping . ) Your cabin steward takes care of your cabin , logically enough . He cleans up the room , turns clown the bed at night , brings you fresh fruit or drinks if you order them , or a sandwich if you 're starved at night . Should you miss a meal , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steward can be a very valuable friend in rough weather , seeing that you 're battened down all right , and eating as much as you think you can handle . For women passengers , stewardesses sometimes substitute for the steward in doing the above chores . If you do n't have a private bath , there 'll be a bath steward for you to notify when you feel in a clean mood ? he or she will get your bath ready for you . ( A tip of a couple of dollars at the end of the trip , will be adequate for the bath steward . ) One of the ship 's officers with whom you might possibly come into contact is the doctor . He generally does n't bother much with mild cases of seasickness , sending along one of the nurses to take care of you ? but if there 's anything really wrong with you , the doctor will be in attendance . If you are well when you come aboard he will attend you without fee should you become ill . If you are sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge you fees comparable to what you 'd pay on land for similar services , subject to the approval of the captain . Well , we all knew that we 'd have to get around to the subject of // seasickness sooner or later , and now is as good a time as any . If seasickness has been at the back of your mind you can forget it . There 's a new seasickness pill out that 's just about guaranteed to prevent it . I have no personal knowledge of the remedy , but it 's called dramamine and it was developed within the last few years by a Baltimore doctor by the name of Leslie N. Gay . You can get dramamine with a prescription and it costs less than ten cents a pill , which are notched down the middle , so you can take them a half at a time before each meal and at bedtime , if necessary . One thing I do know about seasickness , and that is you might be more susceptible to it at some times than at others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of your stomach , etc . I once made a crossing of the notorious Irish Sea , and the only other passenger beside myself who was n't seasick was an Irish sheepdog , so I walked the dog around , while its master wanted to die . And then , there have been times when I have n't felt too sure of myself on a Staten Island ferryboat . Another thing I 've learned through experience is that one of the best ways to get seasick is to take care of somebody who is seasick . I 'd never been seasick in my life until I started to try to take care of my wife . Then after a few hours of stiff upper lip , and all that sort of thing , I begged her to move over on the bed , so we could at least face death together . If it 's your first trip and you do n't know what sort of sailor you 're going to be , I 'd suggest that you do n't overeat , or drink too enthusiastically at any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( There is another school of thought that suggests that one of the best ways to avoid seasickness is to get fairly well potted before you leave , but I would n't know about that . ) Then , according to my own preventative system , you ought to get as much fresh air as possible up on deck before your first shipboard meal . Stay on deck as long as you can , then go directly to the dining saloon , pausing at your cabin only long enough to wash up . Eat moderately at the first meal concentrating on solid , appetizing foods and taking it particularly easy on liquids . Then , up on deck again , if possible until the next meal . By that time you 'll have gained your sea legs , in all probability , and with reasonably good weather and a fair amount of discretion on your part in eating and drinking , you should be in good shape for the rest of the trip . Should you start feeling queasy , get up on deck and out into the fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck if you // possibly can ? there 's something linoleumy about the smell of the interiors of many ships , even some of the finest , that 's sheer murder to unhappy stomachs . I remember a corporal from Iowa on my wartime crossing to Europe . He started to groan as soon as he saw the little Liberty ship on which we were to make the crossing , he groaned his way up the gangplank and he threw himself into a lower bunk as soon as he got on board , and lay there for five days without moving except to crawl to the washroom . It took a direct order from a captain to get him up on deck the sixth day out . IIe dragged himself topside , blinked at the sun , took a deep breath , and was never seasick again . Should events really be too much for you , then get into bed . Do one thing or the other ? get out on deck or get into bed . Do n't just hang around your cabin . The few times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again once I 'm lying flat , with my head on a pillow . Lying quietly like that , you 'll find that you can generally weather even a tough bout of seasickness quite comfortably , though you get into trouble every time you lift your head . Do n't worry , though , you 'll probably breeze along like old Barnacle Bill for the entire trip , especially now that dramamine is supposed to have seasickness licked . If you do , however , do n't laugh at the man with the green face at the next table . You might be wearing a verdant complexion yourself sometime . Another thing about which it 's wise not to be too much of a wiseacre is the lifeboat drills which are held once or twice during the course of a voyage . Modern liners are probably the safest means of transportation in the world today . The last real peacetime disaster in the transatlantic service occurred when the Titanic collided with an iceberg more than thirty-five years ago . After that , except for wartime , passengers and crew got somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of bad accidents in the Caribbean run about fifteen years ago . Then people started attending the lifeboat drills again for a while . Sure , you 'll look the least bit funny running around with a lifebelt on , but no funnier than the rest of the passengers , so do n't let that dissuade you . You just go on ahead to lifeboat drill , and learn where your boat station is , and where you 'll find your lifebelt , and how to get it on . There 's only a minuscule chance , but it 's barely within the realm of possibility that that knowledge might pay off big . Very big . One question most people ask when they 've never been aboard ship is " What do you do with yourself all day ? " By the first or second day out the question changes to " Where do the hours go to , anyway ? " // and by the time you 've been out three or four days ? if you 're like most people ? you 'll be wondering how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . A modern ocean liner is a big place . It 's a floating town , with just about everything you 'd expect to find in a small town , and many other things you 'll never find on Main Street . There are barber shops , hairdressers , and beauty parlors , of course . Camera shop , naturally . You 'll probably find several very smart shops where you 'll be able to buy some of the same things you 'll be shopping for abroad , and at comparable prices . This self-contained resort will publish its own daily paper , with radio news straight out of the wireless room . Religious services are held in the ship 's chapel . There 's generally a first-run , or a prefirst-run movie showing in the theater or dining saloon every day . If you 're traveling with youngsters you 'll be happy to leave them for a while in the children 's playroom under the supervision of the trained nurse in attendance ? and they 'll probably have more fun in there , anyhow . Should you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think of any other way anybody would take a dog on a vacation abroad except absentmindedly ) you 'll be able to board him in the ship 's kennel , where he 'll have a chance peacefully to consider the question of what makes you the way you are , anyway . You can send ship-to-shore radiograms , and probably be able to use the ship-to-shore telephone , in case you have forgotten to put the maid out and to wind the refrigerator . You 'll find at least one good bar for every class aboard the ship and prices are reasonable since the liquor on shipboard is taken out of bond without tax . Remember , however , that you do have to pay for your drinks ( as well as the wine you order in the dining saloon ) although all food , either in the dining saloon or brought to your cabin , is on the house . Should you find yourself absorbing too many calories in the dining saloon and/or the bar , you 'll be able to work off the excess in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , if you 're too lazy or too relaxed to work it off yourself ? or you might try swimming your way across the ocean in the ship 's swimming pool . Many ships have solariums and Turkish baths together with their gyms and swimming pools ? to take care of the really bad cases of hangnails or hangover . On the more sedate side , there 's probably a good library , writing rooms ( and you can mail your letters at the purser 's office ? they 'll be on their way as soon as you dock ) , and a cardroom , where you 'll be // able to whip up a friendly game of bridge , Canasta , gin , or poker . Use reasonable caution , to make sure it 's a friendly game , though the professional cardsters who infested some of the crack liners before the war have just about disappeared , thanks to changing times and the vigilance of the steamship lines . A favorite , though harmless , means of gambling on shipboard are the famous horse races , the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers went when the horses started galloping around the promenade deck . The horses , in this case , are wooden ones , whose progress along a wooden course set up in one of the public rooms is determined by dice cast by a couple of crew members . Another way of making a fast dollar is by means of the ship 's pool , based on the mileage tlic ship travels in each twentyfour-hour period . Passengers invest anywhere from a quarter to a dollar depending on the size of the pool , and the one who most closely predicts the daily mileage pockets the money and buys drinks for a lot of new-found friends . All sorts of special entertainments arc scheduled for the evenings . Cruises usually hold their " get-together " dinner the first night out , and if you like to wear paper hats or blow horns on occasions other than New Year 's Eve , here 's your chance . The ship 's concert is usually held the last night of the voyage , with entertainment provided by the passengers . It is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady wrestler is actually a Metropolitan Opera diva . Last night outs , too , are an occasion for more wearing of paper hats , the singing of Auld Lang Sync , and undying promises to look up people you know you will never see again . It 's all part of an ocean voyage ? one of the purest forms of escapism left to an harassed mankind . CHAPTER TWELVE Several Words to the Wise AMERICA is by far the greatest country on earth ? in every possible , imaginable way . We Americans know more about more different things than anybody else in the world . We have more money than a Mexican , our plumbing is better than a Frenchman 's , our climate is far superior to an Englishman 's , little Switzerland would be lost on a good-sized Texas ranch , our Radio City Music Hall makes the San Carlo Opera House in Naples look like a second-run neighborhood movie . Well , maybe so . At least , that 's what a lot of returning travelers have to say . If that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , maybe it would be better if you just took their word for it , saved your money , and stayed home . You should be glad to be home at the end of your trip abroad ? that 's one mark of a successful vacation . And your travels are sure to give you a realization of how lucky you are to be living in this rich , prosperous , fortunate country of ours . But they should also have given you ? in addition to a sense of gratitude for all the things we have ? an understanding of some of the rest of the world and an appreciation of the fact that we can learn something from everybody . We can teach the Frenchman a thing or two , certainly , about the business of making a living , but he can teach us at least as much about the art of living . The Englishman can learn a lot from us about how to make a home more comfortable , but we can learn from him ? who has cheerfully endured privations and frustrations which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal about mental comfort and a philosophy of living , and how much a native courtesy can do to smooth the rough spots of daily life . We 're efficient , certainly , but we learn that we have no monopoly on efficiency when we visit Switzerland , where you can dial your call to any telephone in the country , and where trains arrive , unload , load and depart again ? all within seconds of their schedule . You see what the Swiss have done with only three assets ? scenery , water power and a hard-working population ? and you realize that national greatness is not necessarily a // question of size , nor wealth a matter of raw materials . From paisans in Italy and peons in Mexico you learn that people can be poor and still be warm , kindly , dignified , spiritually rich , beautiful human beings . You 'll learn about our own country , too , from seeing it with the eyes of the people of western Europe or Latin America . You 'll learn how powerful we really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of moral as well as industrial leadership , and you 'll realize how rich we are as symbols of what men can do to eliminate the misery of the ages if they are given a decent chance . Everywhere you go ? if you take the proper things with you ? you 'll find out that people are friendly , kind , and hospitable to the visitor from rich , fabled , glamorous America . And , despite many of the things you might have read and heard , the right things to take along are not necessarily dollars and cigarettes , and chocolate bars . Much more important as a currency of international good will arc a friendly interest in the people you meet , an awareness of the fact that while you 're in their country you 're a guest in their house , not a lord of the manor surveying his serfs ? a basic decency of attitude that you 'd expect in visitors to your own home town . Right now we in America are engaged in a great selling job ? we 're trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantages of our way of life . We point to the products of our system as proof of its superiority ? our cars , our machinery , our industrial and technical know-how . One of the most important products of a society is its people , and America and the American democratic system are being judged partly on a basis of the sort of people we send abroad as ambassadors ? not the official variety , seen mostly by their foreign counterparts , but principally our tourists and businessmen who come into contact with much larger segments of the population . That 's why it is that you 've got certain duties you ca n't escape while you 're abroad ? even though you 've been planning this vacation for years as your own personal means of escape from all obligations for as long as the trip lasts . And yet the obligations are n't too onerous . They consist , chiefly , of observing the Golden Rule , and acting toward your hosts as you would like visitors to the United States to act toward you . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain your good temper while you 're abroad . Let 's be frank about it ? travel , for all its joys , can be and frequently is a tiring and nerve-wracking experience . You tear yourself away from the routine of your daily life which ? while it might be boring sometimes ? is , nevertheless , made comfortable by habit . The people with whom you come in contact in your workaday world // are familiar folks . They know you and you know them , and you are all pretty sure of how the others generally will act . While you 're traveling , on the other hand , things are exactly the opposite . You 're a stranger among strangers . Your mind is taken up with the thousand-and-one details of travel , and a ceaseless barrage of new impressions is battering at your consciousness . All this might very well make you irritable and impatient with the details of everyday life which compete for your attention with all the things you 've got on your mind . A railway clerk who is slow selling you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow clerk . If it happens at the Gate St. Lazare in Paris , though , the slow clerk becomes a fiendish Frenchman taking out on you his dislike of all Americans by wasting some of your precious time abroad . A waiter in Chicago who ca n't add a check properly is just a dope who ca n't add ? in Rome , however , he becomes part of a national policy to fleece the American tourist . The greatest favor you can do to your own peace of mind while you 're traveling is to get over the idea that everybody is out to take advantage of you . You 'll find ? if you keep an open mind about it ? that people you meet abroad are pretty much like the people you know at home , not much better , not much worse . And , if you do find that some people who deal with tourists have been corrupted by too much contact with too many Americans who throw too much money around , then you 'll meet some wonderful people ? as soon as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will more than make up for their sharp-dealing countrymen by their honesty , their decency , and their hospitality . And get over , for the love of Marshall , the idea that your presence is resented . Particularly among Europeans is the American visitor recognized as ? if nothing else ? a very important adjunct to their economy . Travel has become the United Kingdom 's largest single source of dollars , while in Switzerland the income from travel represents one-seventh of the total national income . The people of western Europe have learned that tourism is their great " invisible export , " the most important source of badly needed dollars gained without the necessity of exporting other things they might need almost as badly . You 're not depriving anybody of anything . The American Automobile Association ( an excellent source of information , by the way , on travel abroad , particularly if you 're planning to take your car ) has been carrying on an intensive campaign to transform American travelers into good-will ambassadors . Their ten corn90 YOUR TRIP ABROAD mandments for Americans abroad are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever seen , so I 'm forwarding them to you here . 1 . Conform with the local customs whenever possible . This does n't mean taking on an extra wife in Saudi Arabia or cheering Franco in Spain , but you should do your best to fall in with the established local dining customs , social amenities , and general habits of dress . That is to say , do n't demand meals in restaurants at odd hours , do n't be a " bone-crusher " where the weak , tender handshake is the custom , and do n't wear shorts where a native would never think of doing so . 2 . Avoid bragging , loudness , and arrogance . Look around here at home . When you realize how distasteful these traits are in your own countrymen , you will never think of displaying them in the presence of strangers . 3 . Try to pick up at least a few words of the language of the country you are visiting . Although English-speaking natives are to be found almost everywhere a knowledge of the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But always be sure of what you are saying . Never resort to " pidgin " talk or use what words you do know in a loose manner . 4 . Learn something about the countries you will visit . Most foreigners , especially Europeans , have some knowledge of our country and our history . At first thought you might think you are pretty well versed in world history , too , but now ask yourself , " What do I know about the establishment of an independent Paraguay ? " If Paraguay is on your itinerary it would help a lot if you have a pretty good answer . Knowing a little in advance will give you the chance to ask intelligent questions ? and thus learn a lot more . And you will also arouse respect for all Americans . If you are visiting the countries participating in the Marshall Plan it is especially important that you know something about how it affects them . They are sure to ask you questions . 5 . Do n't flaunt your money ; learn to spend it as the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages and salaries are lower than they are in the United States . To flaunt your money and purchasing power is to give offense . Do n't try to bribe petty officials , servants , or others for services not generally offered . Do n't tip excessively , yet do n't tip too little . First try to find out what the local customs are and guide yourself accordingly . When in doubt add ten or fifteen per cent to the bill . 6 . Do n't haggle . The assumption that every tradesman and merchant automatically marks up his wares for tourists is not generally true . In those places where haggling is the practice , get the merchant 's // price , then make your offer . Either settle on the difference or move on . Excessive haggling may save you a few cents , but it wo n't improve your standing . 7 . Be moderate . It is rare to find drunkenness outside the United States in any but the lowest specimens . One inebriate American ? however pleasant ? can do more to destroy our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a year to build it up . 8 . Be friendly . Treat all the people you meet in foreign lands with decency and courtesy . Do n't exaggerate the differences between you and your hosts . Be extravagant in complimenting food , architecture , climate , traditions . Forget how much better they may be doing things at home . And keep smiling , at any one and every one . 9 . Avoid arguments . Of course , as you become more intimate with the people you are visiting , there will be differences of opinion , but short of defending your honor , save the arguments until later , until they know you well enough to think of you as an individual , not as a representative of the United States . lo . Be careful with the women ( for men only ) . In almost all the popular tourist countries , women have won a high degree of emancipation , but it does not always follow the same lines as in our country . ' With few exceptions the relationship between single men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America may be downright taboo in other lands . In any case , it 's advisable to have a talk with one of the local gentry before you set out " dating . " Though these ten points are a summary they may be boiled down still further ; in fact , to one sentence : When abroad , you are a guest ; act like one . To which I want to add just one sentence . Act according to these precepts , and you 'll have an address book full of the names of friends ? real friends ? you 've made abroad , and you 'll come home a true cosmopolite , with a real knowledge of what people are like and what is going on in the world outside the United States . Most important ? you 'll have had so much real pleasure on your vacation abroad that you 'll already be looking forward to your next one . CHAPTER ONE PART II Britain Is Ready ? if You Are ! I 'VE ALWAYS recommended strongly that Americans going to Europe for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit England at all , and for very good reasons . In the first place , Britain will be " different " enough as your first sight of Europe to fascinate you . The tiny trains and cars , the scrubbed miniature landscape , the left-handed traffic , the difference in the appearance of the people and the stores and buildings from anything you 've seen in America will keep you gawking madly at everything at once until you 've had a chance to get used to things after a week or so . Actually , though , Britain is more like the United States in most ways than is any other European country . So if you save your visit to England for the end of your European trip , it will be somewhat like coming home , and instead of being stimulated by what you see , you might find it something of a letdown after some of the more marked " differences " of the continent . England is , however , the perfect beginning for European travel . The first few days you 're abroad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things as passports , customs , immigration formalities , currency exchange , getting around town , and finding your way back to your hotel . That 's when you 'll be doubly glad you 're in England , where the people arc all amazingly courteous and patient with visitors , and speak your own language ? or a version close enough to enable you to make yourself understood and to comprehend their answers . And , finally , if you go first to England you 'll be so excited over the idea of being abroad that you wo n't pay too much attention to the food ; while if , on the other hand , you come to England after a sojourn on the continent , the English food is bound to suffer in comparison with some of the really spectacular meals you 've had in France , Belgium , Switzerland , and Italy . Maybe we 'd better get this question of the food in England out of the way once and for all . No American visitor ever starved in England . As a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ austerity program . At worst , the English food is adequate . Nobody in his right mind ever went to England on a gastronomic holiday even in the best of times . British food has never been particularly distinguished except , perhaps , for the excellent beef and Yorkshire pudding , and an unfortunate propensity on the part of some British cooks to prepare a really serviceable meal , throw a generous helping of lukewarm water on the whole business , and set it on the table . Aside from the rare gourmet who travels primarily to enjoy new adventures in food and drink , though , few Americans will find their enjoy94 YOUR TRIP ABROAD ment of their visit to England diluted by the austerity program . All of Britain 's storied countryside awaits you , most of it completely unspoiled by war . The lush , green valley of the Thames , Windsor , Canterbury , Stratford-on-Avon , Oxford , Cambridge , the Lake District , Edinburgh ( which presents its Music and Drama Festival in August and September ) , the Trossachs and Scottish highlands , the dour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lovely sands and quiet thatchedhouse villages , the rolling farmlands of East Anglia ? all remain as peaceful as though the war and austerity had never been heard of . You 'll fare better , too , in the rural areas where farmers , like their unreconstructed counterparts all over the world , have never taken too well to the discipline of rationing . To them an egg is an egg is an egg , to be eaten personally , given to a friend , or disposed of as it suits them . It 's not black-marketing , exactly , but you just ca n't help eating better when you 're in the country . Hotels in British provincial cities once varied only from poor to atrocious . Things have improved greatly , however , since Britain became tourist conscious ? so much so that " American service " is now almost a fetish . But you always had much better luck in little country inns , and so it is today . Staying at the best of them is a lrighspot in the visits of knowing Americans . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? without partaking too freely of British discomfort . And you can stay at country hotels and inns for about $2. z5 to $3.50 per clay with meals . ( Note : Prices we 'll be talking about are those in existence early in 1950 . At the time of the devaluation of the pound British hotel and transportation people pledged themselves to try to hold the line on prices . Better check , though , with your travel agent or with the official British information sources listed at the end of this chapter . ) I 've always had a theory that every country had its own vintage season . Most of the United States , for example , has always seemed at its best to me in the fall , the season of bright , crisp weather , burning leaves , and football games . Americans who know England generally agree that it is most attractive in the spring when the countryside achieves a greenness possible only in a climate as damp as Britain 's . There are those , however , who prefer September and October . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming as is the countryside ? London has always been the greatest attraction for the American visitor . Though badly battered by the Luftwaffe 's air blitz of 1940 ? 41 and the buzz bombs and rockets of the final two years of the war , London is still the largest city in the world and ranks with Rome and Paris as the most historic . You 'll have to look for it to see most of the bomb damage , as London has long since tidied up . It wo n't be until you notice the large number of vacant lots , and remember that there had been no vacant spots in the city since its rebuilding after the Great Fire of 1666 , that you will realize how much damage was done . You 'll see great flat spaces around the docks in the East End , and you 'll note the chunks chewed off corners around Fleet Street and Mayfair . But if you knew London in the old days , the whole business will really hit you // as you poke around the little streets in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloucester Place ? a district of carefully tended brick four- and five-story houses , very much like those on Beacon Street and Louisburg Square in Boston , where the front steps were always scrubbed , the brasswork was always shining , and the houses always smelled slightly of furniture polish . It was a neighborhood of " digs " in the old days , where single , respectable , middle-class people , holding middle-class office jobs , led single , respectable lives . More important to Americans , it was a district where nice young visitors could get a comfortable room , breakfast , and the solicitous if somewhat scatterbrained attention of a whiteaproned maid and white-jacketed steward ? all for five to ten bucks a week . When you wander around the neighborhood now you 're suddenly struck by the impact of the war and the recovery years on the whole of London . The blitzed houses are gone , but some of the blight remains . Many houses are scorched and smoke-stained ; there are no more shined brass and polished woodwork . The whole district needs scrubbing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to be readily obtainable , and men and women are starting to do the cleanup work along with the more important jobs of reconstruction . Meanwhile , London is still somewhat shabby , a bit down at the heels . That ? the visitor who knew London before will suddenly realize ? is the something wrong about London he 's been trying to figure out in the back of his mind . But he 'll be cheered by the sight of London consciously and actively dressing up , and he 'll be sure the worst is long since past . If you 're seeing London for the first time , though , your enjoyment of this great world capital will in no way be diminished by these scars of war and marks of national self-denial . In fact I think you 'll be somewhat surprised by the bustling life and consistent good humor you 'll find all about you in London . Americans reading about Britain 's struggle to get back on its feet economically are likely to have a false impression of London as a fairly grim sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the least bit grim is due , I think , to the amazing resilience and good temper of the average Britisher , his remarkable ability to live within and at peace with himself , and his splendid sense of humor ? one of the least understood and most maligned characteristics of any people on earth . The Englishman 's sense of humor is exactly the opposite of ours . He gets his kicks out of understatement , while most of our gags are based on overstatement . The British low-key humor has served him as well in taking him through his trying years as the extravagant exaggeration of their woes served our GIs as a vital safety valve during the days of training and combat . Result of all this is to make London ( and all of the British Isles ) a much happier place to be in than you 'd imagine from reading the horrendous tales of misery and privation that have been published about England in the past few years . Nobody 's going hungry and nobody 's throwing bombs in Downing Street , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and some British newspapers have thrown everything but their presses at the government . // c WHAT TO DO : I 've always had some of my best times in London just moseying . If you like to wander you can spend days that way , poking around and soaking up atmosphere of old England . Start off with the obvious tourist attractions you 've read about , then follow out whatever interests you most . Begin with Westminster Abbey , to give yourself a fast indoctrination in British tradition . It 's called " the heart of England , " and it has been the scene of all British coronations since William the Conqueror received the crown after the Battle of Hastings in io66 . Then move on to the Houses of Parliament , Big Ben , and the government buildings at Whitehall . And take a one-minute look at the famous doorway of the Prime Minister 's residence at to Downing Street , while you think of a lean and funereal Chamberlain coining back from Munich to announce that he had saved the peace of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mess , puffing a cigar and making the V-sign with his chubby fingers while leading his nation through its greatest battle . Then on to the Tower of London , and its famed Beefeaters in Tudor uniforms , with their talcs of murdered princelings , and Anne Boleyn walking around with her head tucked underneath her arm at the midnight hour , and to London Bridge which , like Great Britain , was always said to be falling clown but never did collapse . Buckingham Palace at io A.M. in time to take a picture of the boys in Busbies at the changing of the guard , the British Museum , the National Gallery , St. Paul 's Cathedral ( which suffered only slight damage while the city all around it was in flames ) , Piccadilly Circus , which is a circle of streets and avenues in the center of town , not a gamboling place for lions and tigers and elephants . Leicester ( pronounced " Lester " ) Square , Regent Street , one of the finest shopping streets in London , and Trafalgar Square with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to roar only on the most spectacular occasions . By now you are ready for a new pair of feet , and you 're qualified as a more sophisticated wanderer . You stroll along Pall Mall ( pronounced " Pell Mell " ) past a line of old clubs , many of whose members would appear to have been ancient when the fathers of some of our Fifth-Avenue windowsitters in New York were still stealing railroads . You stick your nose into pubs on Fleet Street , the newspaper section , and observe with wonder how London reporters always seem to look more like journalists than do our newspapermen . You move into the " city , " the financial district around the Bank of England ( known as the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street ) and the Stock Exchange , where every man , even the clerks and runners , either wears a tophat , or goes hatless . You walk into and out of smart shops in Bond Street , buying a lot of tweeds and things now that clothing is unrationed . You stagger into a workingman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while that most British beers and ales were n't meant to be served chilled . You listen to the talk around the bar and try to imagine what would happen if a Cockney tried to talk to a native of Lubbock , Texas , in what is supposed to be their common tongue . You become aware of a new and unwholesome type of postwar Cockney , the " Spiv , " who sells // things from a pushcart by day and is a black-market operator by night . His cloth cap , muffler , and double-breasted overcoat with grotesquely padded shoulders are the uniform of his calling , just as the pearl-gray slouch hat and tight-waisted overcoat used to mark the typical American racketeer . You look at the billboards and note with wonder that forty-odd plays and musicals are showing in London theaters , comparing it sadly with the state of the New York stage where so many theaters have been transformed into circuses for the caterwauling cretins who make up radio and television studio audiences . You stop for tea in Mayfair , and occasionally you see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the comparative drabness of so many of the women in the streets and shops . Comes Sunday , and it seems that everything has been abolished throughout the United Kingdom . If you 've been so careless as to allow yourself to be uninvited somewhere for the week end the best place for you is Hyde Park , the kibitzer 's paradise ? a sort of combination of New York 's Union Square and Columbus Circle , where soapboxers orate on everything from communism to yoga . Then , when four o'clock rolls around and the cinemas open up , you might take in a movie . ? ? WHERE TO EAT : Despite the less-than-sensational reputation of British cooking in general , London has many restaurants that have been world-famous for years . Naturally , they ca n't serve under rationing meals comparable to their normal prewar standard , but considering the limited supplies they have to work with , the better restaurants do remarkably well . One consolation is that under Britain 's price control system , meals at the better legitimate restaurants are comparatively inexpensive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's what the May Fair Hotel offered for lunch , while I was there , for 5 shillings ? which now is 70 cents : First you had your choice of hors d'oeuvres or soup : entrees consisted of creamed fish in shell , braised pheasant , brochette of chicken livers , or macaroni and cheese ; Brussels sprouts , mashed potatoes , apple pie or pudding or other sweet , and coffee or tea . The best restaurants are allowed to charge a cover charge , if there 's music , which may bring the price of lunch up to about $I.6o , and for dinner to about $2.00 . Watch out for wines , though , if you 're at all limited on funds . Prices are uncontrolled , and here 's where the top eatingplaces recoup somewhat from the relatively low cost of their price-controlled meals . One of London 's most popular restaurants is the Bagatelle on Mayfair Place . The food , good by any standard , rates with the best obtainable in London . Another reason for Bagatelle 's popularity might be the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Margaret and her many escorts . And that means a lot in London . Among the other good restaurants are : The Cafe Royal , Coq d'Or , Churchill 's , Hatchett 's , The Hungaria , Mirabelle , Maison Basque , Marietta 's , the Pastoria , Oddendino 's , Prunier 's , Scott 's , Simpson 's , A 1'Ecu de France , Aperitif Grill , Ivy , and Quaglino 's . Grills and dining rooms of // such leading hotels as Claridge 's , the Dorchester , May Fair , Grosvenor House , Berkeley , Carlton , Ritz , and Savoy are among the finest eatingplaces in London . Dressing for dinner is compulsory at the Berkeley , Dorchester , and Savoy . Some of London 's finest food is served in Soho , the Bohemian , Greenwich-Villagey section of town , where you 're likely to find French , Italian , Hungarian , Chinese , Greek , Rumanian , and Jewish cookery in the little restaurants along one narrow street . Soho restaurants include legitimate and black-market places . Food at legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in quantity and variety . I was advised to try one black-market place just for the experience . It was an experience , all right . ' Faking a friend to lunch , I paid a bill of five pounds , including wine and tip , which at the time came to twenty dollars . After that , I stuck to the Spartan life . I could n't afford to do otherwise . WHERE TO DRINK : The British public house is as much a trademark of the Englishman 's way of life as the cafe is the Frenchman 's . Here he comes to meet his friends , talk politics , football , racing , cricket , or his trade , and place an occasional bet with a bookie friend on horse or dog racing or the football pool , which is a British National mania comparable to our baseball pennant races , with the gambling phase of it legalized and better organized . You 'll find all sorts of pubs in Great Britain , from the swank establishments in the West End of London , whose snack bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and country pubs which are the lineal and spiritual descendants of the cheery roadside inns of the days of Dickens and Queen Victoria . Practically all pubs have a cool , dark , sudsy atmosphere redolent of polished wood and brass and worn leather chairs . You 'll find the inevitable darts game going on in one corner , and you wo n't have to worry about protecting your head from wild pitches , unless there 's a woman playing . Most Englishmen are reasonably accurate with their darts , even if they 've ' ad a pint or so , and they play the game with admirable restraint . ( I shudder to think of the shambles which would result if we , with our more ebullient national temperament , were to mix martinis with dart-throwing . ) Some pubs have skittles with their beer . I had always thought that skittles were something like pretzels or potato chips until I found out that it is ( or arc ) a game of throwing disks at wooden pins , sort of a combination of bowling and quoits . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato crisps . Chips , in England , are French fried potatoes . You 'll find lots of differences between the English and American languages , some amusing and some potentially a bit embarrassing , if you misuse the words according to British standards . Thus you never call any man a bum in England , since his burn is what he 's sitting on . And " bloody " ? no matter how many times you hear it used in a pub ? is still a narsty word , not to be used in mixed company . But do n't be insulted if an Englishman says your wife is homely . He 's not talking about her face ? he means " homey . " English pubs have more of a clublike atmosphere than the average // American bar and grill , since the clientele changes very slowly , if ever , and a Britisher chooses his pub as much by the company it keeps as by the brew it serves . Americans , used to only three main types of malt beverage ? light beer , dark beer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat confusing . Offhand , I can think of lager , bitter beer , mild ale , old ( strong ) ale , and stout . There 's a seemingly endless combination of these which the barman or barmaid can draw for you , such as the seemingly contradictory mild and bitter , and ' alf and ' alf which ? to the best of my research ? can consist of half of anything and half of anything else . There 's also a hot-weather concoction called shandygaff , a combination of ale and ginger beer which is the most outlandish .. . well , you try it and see for yourself . With my heart in my mouth , I 'd like to put my two cents ' worth into the warm beer versus chilled beer controversy , which has been the greatest strain on Anglo-American amity since the question of taxation without representation . In the first place , the only English brew which is anything like the beer we drink at home is lager . Secondly , it is my considered opinion ( and I 'll probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lager , English beers taste better at room temperature than iced ? they were brewed to be served that way . There , I 've said it , and I 'm glad . When it comes to stronger drinks gin is the favorite of Englishmen , who drink it as gin and bitters ( sometimes called pink gin ) , gin and vermouth , gin and It ( short for Italian vermouth ) , gin and tonic , and gin and lime . You get Scotch when you order whisky in England ( if you 're lucky ; whisky is scarce , since most of the output goes for export ) or occasionally Irish whiskey . Rye , bourbon , and Canadian are practically unknown . Whiskey , by the way , is spelled " whisky " when it 's Scotch . It picks up the " e " somewhere in the Irish sea , becoming " whiskey " for Irish and all other varieties . , . r.4 HOW TO BE MERRY : Like so many things in Britain today , London night life is in a state of flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cafe society worked out a useful dodge for getting around many of Britain 's anti-cavorting regulations which closed all liquor stores and pubs at various hours before midnight . It was called a " bottle party , " which was just a circumlocution for a night club doing legally what the law was intended to prevent , but which everybody wanted to do anyway . By means of such techniques as membership cards and the sale of liquor by the bottle delivered from a liquor store , the bottle parties maintained the legal fiction of being private clubs which , therefore , could stay open as long as their members cared to stick around . The government later lifted some of the restrictions and allowed regularly licensed restaurants and cabarets to remain open until 2:30 A.M. , which , they reasoned with considerable logic , was as late as an Englishman generally wanted to be up . That took most of the wind out of the sails of the bottle clubs and most of the abracadabra about membership cards and things like that has disappeared . loo YOUR TRIP ABROAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , which really has members , who must pay an entrance fee in addition to annual dues . Dinner with wine will cost about $15 to $20 per person . Other fashionable dining and dancing places include the Four Hundred , the Orchid Room , the Embassy , and the Nightingale in Berkeley Square ( no gag ) . In addition , many of the best restaurants listed previously have floor shows and dancing . These include the Bagatelle , Churchill 's , Claridge 's , the Savoy , May Fair , Grosvenor House , Dorchester , Berkeley , and Ritz . Some of the less expensive places operating while I was in London last included the Astor , Cocoanut Grove , and Cabaret . In London , night clubs ? particularly the medium-priced ones ? open , close , and change ownership almost as rapidly as they do in New York . Best check with your hotel porter or the British Travel Association 's Information Bureau in Leicester Square , London , W.C.a ( more about them later ) for up-to-the-minute data on the smart or the reasonably priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flourishing , with a great many plays and musical shows from which to choose your evening 's entertainment . Prices for seats vary from 35 cents for the gallery to about $1.90 for the front section of the orchestra . In London theaters you buy your program from the usher for about a shilling . - 3 FOR THE SPORTSMAN ( AND WOMAN ) : England has always been known for its sporting traditions , and the visiting sportsman finds something going on all the time to interest him ? be he or she of the active or spectator variety . Naturally you 'd expect to find some of the world 's finest golf courses in Scotland , where the game was developed , and you wo n't be disappointed . First of all , certainly , is the Old Course at St. Andrews , north of Edinburgh on the east coast , and most famous in all of golfdom . Other Scottish courses almost as well known include Muirfield , Troon , North Berwick , and Gleneagles . Many of England 's finest courses are links , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westward Ho , in Devon , laid out in 1869 and one of the oldest in England ; Hoylake near Liverpool , Sandwich , and Deal ? just to name a few of the very many . Sunningdale , not far from London , is generally regarded as England 's premier inland course . There 's practically no town in England without at least a couple of good courses near by , and the golfer can play some of the best-known courses while visiting London , Liverpool , Edinburgh , and Glasgow . Just about the same can be said for tennis . You 'll see fine courts all over England . The grass courts are practically all excellent , and if you find yourself invited for a week end in the country you can expect to get in plenty of good tennis . An island scored and ravined by every manner of river and stream and dotted by lakes , Britain is a paradise for fishermen . All along the south coast lies a double line of chalk downs from which spring such wellknown streams as the Test , Itche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English trout fishing famous . Three- and four-pounders are not uncommon , and the dry-fly fishing is some of the finest you 'll find anyBRITAIN // where . In Scotland and Wales there 's excellent fishing for salmon , brown trout , and sea trout , and in the moor country of western England the wetfly fisherman will enjoy excellent sport casting for salmon and trout in the swift , rocky , mountain streams . Grouse shooting in Scotland has been a favorite sport of the British gentry for many generations . There 's also good hunting for deer , partridge , pheasant , wild duck and geese , ptarmigan , hare , rabbit , woodcock , snipe , plover , quail , and landrail . Open season for grouse in Scotland is from mid-August to mid-December . Your game license , which includes gun permit , is about $8.5o for the season , or $5.00 or $3.00 for limited periods . Britons do much of their hunting and fishing in private preserves , but " rough shooting " ( in the open countryside ) and " coarse fishing " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many country hotels and inns provide fishing facilities for guests . For the cyclist and the hiker Britain presents the widest variety of landscape ? mountains , hills , moors , bottom lands , lakes , rivers , rugged coasts and sandy bays ? all within the compass of a group of islands that look insignificant on a map of the world . Other countries may offer higher mountains , wider rivers , or more extensive plains , but none can show such a variety of scenes in such a small and accessible territory . That 's probably why a hiking or cycling tour through Britain has been a favorite vacation for college students and other young American travelers since the turn of the century . The Youth Hostel movement has enjoyed a great vogue in the British Isles , with more than three hundred and fifty hostels in all parts of England , Northern Ireland , Scotland , and Wales offering low-cost accommodations for the walker or cyclist . If you 're more of a spectator sportsman you 'll find that Britain offers as much to you as it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans , and you 'll discover some form of horse racing going on in England at all times of the year . The flat-racing season begins in late March and continues until December , when steeplechasing and hurdle racing , known as National Hunt racing , take over until March rolls around again . First big race of the flat-racing season is the Lincolnshire Handicap towards the end of March . At about the same time the most formidable and spectacular steeplechase in the world , the Grand National at Aintree , near Liverpool , is run . In the second week in April comes the opening meeting of the year at Newmarket , a little town about sixty miles from London which is given over almost entirely to racing and has been recognized as the headquarters of the British turf since the days of Charles II . There are between thirty and forty racing stables in the town , and more than a thousand thoroughbreds are trained every day on Newmarket Heath . What is probably the greatest horse race in the world , the Derby , ( pronounced " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Epsom , a track situated high in the chalk downs of Surrey , about fifteen miles from London . Gypsies encamp on the Downs during the race week , and they ? together with the general atmosphere of carnival and side show ? make up a scene to be found nowhere else and at no other time . More than half // a million Englishmen , from royalty to charwomen , attend and bet a few shillings on their choices , which usually are touted to them by the gypsies . In strong contrast is the Royal Meeting at Ascot , two weeks later . The King and Queen are in residence for the week at nearby Windsor Castle , and on certain days of the meeting drive in state to the royal box . A cricket game at Lord 's Cricket Ground in London is just about the most typical British institution an American can hope to experience on a short visit . Do n't expect to be able to understand it , simply because it involves the hitting of a ball with a bat , as in baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of the crowd . Probably the most vociferous rooting you 'll hear will be an occasional " Well bowled , sir ! " called with reasonable restraint as words of encouragement to the bowler ? a man who throws the ball at the batsman with a motion which is a cross between the peg of a center-fielder trying to catch a runner at the plate , and a shot-putter with a sore arm . At various times during the goings on , both players and spectators will take time out for tea ? and any humorous reference here to Ebbet 's Field would be just too obvious . The cricket equivalent of our World Series is the Test Matches held mostly at Lord 's in London during the summer . Football , though , is probably closer to being England 's national game in point of mass interest ? as it is in most of the countries of Europe and Latin America . It 's the game we at home call soccer , however ? nothing like our American football . Nearest thing to the American game is the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our football and featuring tackling , lateral passing , and something like a scrimmage . Rugby is mostly a university game in England . Their football is played most of the year in an aggregation of professional and amateur leagues completely incomprehensible to the American mind . Football crowds in Britain run up to as many as 130,000 for a game and there is terrific interest in the sport , culminating in the Cup Final played at Wembley , London , in April . Other British sporting events of top interest to the spectator are the world tennis championships played in June and July at Wimbledon near London , the British Amateur Golf Championship in May , and the British Open in July , and the Oxford-Cambridge boat races in London in March . , - at3 WIIAT TO WEAR : First , look over again Chapter Six , " What to Wear " back in Part I. That will refresh your recollection of the best sort of travel clothes in general . Next , examine the chart of average London temperatures which follows , compare it with the weather you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wear during seasons of similar temperatures in your own home town . Temperatures given on page 103 arc Fahrenheit . You 'll note that the average summer highs are considerably lower than they are in most sections of the United States . Therefore , men should n't bother to take any really lightweight outfits with them unless they 're headed for warmer climates later on their trip . Palm Beach , rayon mixtures , tropical worsteds , or seersuckers just are n't right for the British // climate , even in midsummer , when nights can grow as cool as October evenings in the northern United States . By the same token , cotton dresses are not a necessary part of the woman 's wardrobe for Britain , although a cotton dress might be useful for the hottest summer days . You 'll want suits or wool dresses for the cooler days which come along , too , in July and August . A raincoat is a must for an English visit , and a rain hat is a good idea also . Rainiest months are December through February but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raincoat at any time . Take along a pull-over or two , or buy a couple in England . And good heavy walking shoes , particu larly for Scotland . Men will be wearing medium-weight sports jackets and slacks most days and women will find sports jacket and skirt combina tions very comfortable . The British wear odd jacket and slacks combina tions much more frequently than we do . In fact , a tweed cap , brown Harris tweed jacket , and gray flannel slacks are practically standard for the Englishman 's casual and week-end wear . Do n't forget that the British wear evening clothes more frequently than we do in the States , so take evening wear along if you expect to go to any of the more gala places , and if your luggage will stand the extra load . Remember that clothing is no longer rationed in England , so you might be able to pick up accessories you 've forgotten to take along or eliminated to save weight or luggage space . Men may want to pack fewer socks and fill out their wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO BUY : In its efforts to step up its influx of tourist-brought dollars , the British government has taken almost all rationing and other lids off purchases of British goods in Britain by American visitors . The purchase tax , sometimes running as high as loo per cent of the sales price and the bane of the British consumer , is eliminated for you if you have all purchases worth more than one pound ( $2.8o ) delivered to your ship or plane , or shipped to your home address in the States . You must , of course , include them on your declaration form when you go through United States Customs on your return . If you want to buy anything for // your immediate use in Britain you can also eliminate the purchase tax on certain articles by means of purchase-tax coupons obtainable free at banks when you buy British pounds with your dollars . ( A minimum of $67. zo , or 24 pounds . ) What Paris is to women 's fashions , London is ? almost ? to men 's wear . London is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few middle-class men would buy a ready-made suit or overcoat . The town , therefore , is full of skilled tailors who are accustomed to catering to persons other than millionaires . A Scotch tweed suit , tailored in Savile Row , will cost you about $90 , compared to the $250 you 'd have to pay for something comparable by a New York tailor . Beautifully tailored , soft camel 's hair topcoats will cost you about $90 also , with about the same price differential between London and America . If you 're planning to buy any clothing do so as soon as possible after your arrival , so the tailor will have a chance to complete the job up to the final try-on before you leave . The same is true if you 've decided to buy a pair or two of the fine bench-made shoes which you can get at London bootmakers for about $z8 , compared to $50 for their nearest American equivalent . If you 're not staying in England long enough to have a suit or coat made , you can buy the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Weatherproof trenchcoats are another British specialty , as are cashmeres and wool sweaters and mufflers . Argyll socks are probably the best known here in America , but all English wool socks are good buys for their price range . While London is primarily a men 's fashion center , women readers might want to buy a length of tweed or worsted material to have made into suits , jackets , or skirts when they get back home , since British tailors are n't as distinguished for their styling for women as they are for men . The wool and cashmere pull-overs and cardigans are at least as popular with women as they are with men . And the outstanding coat manufacturers , such as Burberry 's , all have their women 's departments . Umbrellas are a British specialty . ( The weather , do n't forget , and remember Mr. Chamberlain ? ) Fine , pencil-thin bumbershoots the like of which are n't made any place else , are available in English shops at reasonable prices . Probably the best single buy in England these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others is antique silver . Beautiful old pieces sell for a fraction of what you have to pay for them in America . You 're saving duties , shipping costs ( if you take it along yourself ) , and markups of importers and retailer . Fine English china and glass are almost as good a bet , but heavier , more fragile , and difficult to handle . c.sr-3 WI-IERE TO STAY : London 's hotels are doing a good job with what they 've got . Remember , they have n't been able to get tableware or linen for ten years , though recently the government has given special priorities for the purchase of these items to hotels catering to visitors from abroad . Last time I was in London I stayed at the May Fair , and found the service excellent , as always . The staff was just as friendly , the hotel just as // clean , the atmosphere just as pleasant . In the morning the waiter brings your breakfast to your room with the same cheerful bustle , and takes the shining cover off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masterpiece . And if the breakfast that meets your eager eye is n't quite what it was in the good old days ? anyway it tastes that much better for the build-up . London hotel rates vary considerably , with the average about $3.75 a night without breakfast . Among the best hotels and their single rates , with bath , are : Claridge , from about $io ; Dorchester , $7.70 ; Grosvenor House , $6.3o ; Waldorf , from $2.10 ; Cumberland , $2.40 ; Regent Palace and Strand Palace , $2.05 and up ( with breakfast ) ; Brown 's Hotel , $3.00 ; Oddcndino 's , $3.50 . I 've mentioned before that country inns offer perhaps the most picturesque and at the same time comfortable accommodations in Britain . England 's largest hotel chain , surprisingly enough , specializes in the restoration and operation of inns centuries old . Known as Trust Houses , the name reflecting the basic idea of keeping the lovely old buildings in trust for all the people , the firm was founded about half a century ago . Today it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are at least five hundred years old , and some have accommodated such historical personages as King John in 1213 , Richard III , Mary Queen of Scots , Oliver Cromwell , Charles Dickens , Lord Nelson ? and their horses . Food in the country inns is usually better than you 'll get in the big cities . Some of the inns have their own farms . Rates are reasonable , ranging from about $5.25 per day including meals , at the de luxe Shakespeare Hostelrie in Stratford to less than $2o per week at lovely little inns accommodating only four to a dozen guests . Here you 'll find the Tudor timbers and beams , fine paneling and cupboards and heavy oak tables of rural English inns which you read about in Dickens . You can travel all through England , staying only at these charming old inns , by booking your reservations through Trust Houses , Piccadilly , London ; or your local travel agent . The Associated British and Irish Railways can make reservations for you at about fifty hotels in Britain and Northern Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose greatest asset is their convenience , to magnificent resort hotels including some of the finest in all of Great Britain . Among these are the Manor House Hotel in Moretonhampstead , Devon ; Tregenna Castle Hotel in St. Ives , Cornwall ; Welcombe Hotel , Stratford-on-Avon ; Midland Hotel in Morecambe ; Royal Station Hotel in York ; and in Scotland the Lochalsh Hotel at Kyle of Lochalsh , and the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire , where the hotel 's golf course is one of the most famous and picturesque in Scotland . Minimum single rates , with breakfast , at all railway hotels is about $3.00 . Maximum single rate at their city hotels is about $5.00 , with the top running higher at the resort hotels . One last note ? despite a strong rebuilding and refurbishing effort , British hotels are still inadequate to take care of all visitors during the peak season . So be sure to reserve your hotel accommodations well in advance through your travel agent . lo6 YOUR TRIP ABROAD , .. s , WHAT TO TIP : The 15 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tips on Tipping , " applies pretty much in all the better restaurants in Britain , tapering down to about 10 per cent to 12 per cent in the cheaper places . Devaluation or no , a shilling is still the standard tip for bellboy or doorman ? corresponding to the quarter you 'd give for comparable services at home . Tip the hatcheck girl sixpence to a shilling , depending on the swank of the hotel , restaurant , or night club . Sixpence is the minimum tip for a cabdriver . Make it about 15 per cent of the fare ? and if you can estimate 15 per cent in British currency , you 're related to Einstein . So you 'd better figure on threepence tip for every two shillings on the meter , and you 'll be about right . Carrying through the formula for the rest of your tipping , leave sixpence for four shillings , a shilling for eight shillings , one shilling and sixpence for ten shillings , three shillings for a pound , etc . Most of the figuring will be taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15 per cent charge to your bill for service . And that does it for you , quite well , in England , in contrast to some other countries , where you 're expected to tip almost as much as if there were no service charge . In Britain , if a service charge is added to your bill you need tip only for jobs above and beyond the call of duty , such as sending a bellhop to town to pick up theater or railway tickets . , 9IIOW TO GET TIIIRE : In Chapter Eleven in Part I we have already discussed many of the most famous liners sailing to United Kingdom ports from the United States . You 'll want to consult your travel agent about schedules and reservations , so we wo n't take space here to go over the list again . Going by air , you have your choice of two Americanflag carriers , Pan American World Airways and American Overseas Airlines , and the British Overseas Airways Corporation ( BOAC ) . All three are outstanding international carriers , completely dependable and absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its de luxe President service see Chapter Ten , Part I ) , Constellations , and DC-4s ; American Overseas and BOAC are flying Stratocruisers and Constellations . Basic fares from New York to London are the same on all lines ? $35o one way , $63o round trip , or $466.7o round trip on the special 6o-day excursion tickets good between October 1 and April 30 . A special 15-day round-trip excursion rate , being tried experimentally from January 1 to March 30 , reduces the fare to $385 , the equivalent of one way plus ten per cent . Stratocruisers are scheduled to make the flight in about thirteen or fourteen hours , though with strong tailwinds they 've flown it in under ten hours . Constellations make it in an hour or so longer than the Stratocruisers . All schedules are dependent on flight plans and weather conditions , so flying times listed above can only be approximate . Since Britain is such a small country , you probably wo n't do much flying while you 're there , though British European Airways , the government-owned domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between London and Manchester , Liverpool , Belfast , Prestwick , Glasgow , and northern Scotland . // Nationalized under the Labor government , the British railroads have made big strides in recovery from wartime destruction . Many new cars have been added to such crack trains as the Cornish Riviera , the Night Ferry , and the Flying Scotsman , and you 'll find most British trains fast , clean , and comfortable . You can book in one of two classes : first class , which corresponds somewhat to our parlor cars and is quite luxurious and uncrowded ; and third class which is very comfortable , but likely to be crowded , rather like our railroad coach travel . ( There is no second class on British trains . ) Rates are about five cents a mile in first class , and about three cents a mile in third . As a tourist you can buy from British and Irish Railways in the United States mileage coupons for a minimum of a thousand miles ( $22.40 third class and $33.6o first class ) which will result in savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary rail fares . Additional blocks of tickets good for 250 miles third class and 166 miles first class are obtainable for $3.6o . These mileage tickets , which do not restrict your travel in any way , are exchangedin England for your actual railroad ticket . Bus companies in England have not been nationalized , so there is no standard rate . Fares average something less than 11/2 cents a mile , and the busses are generally clean and comfortable . Bus travel , too , is the best way of seeing the countryside by public conveyance , since the slower you go , usually , the more you see . Full bus information is available at the Central Enquiry Bureau , Victoria Coach Station , 164 Buckingham Palace Road , London S.W.1 . RED TAPE : For a country going through the rigors of rationing and a strictly controlled economy , Britain has kept its red tape for American visitors to a minimum . Many of the regulations have been relaxed , and some have been specially drawn , to aid said visitors . You can , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish , or buy one there and be allowed enough of Britain 's precious gasoline to take care of all reasonable sight-seeing and touring needs . England is the only place in the world where the visitor is entitled to free medical or dental treatment if necessary . Any doctor or dentist in the national health plan is available . To get to Great Britain you 'll need a passport but no visa . You require no other documents for entry into Britain , but do n't forget the vaccination certificate you 'll need to got back into the States ( without having to be vaccinated , right then and there ) . You 'll be allowed to bring into England with you a small amount of tobacco and liquor that seems to the customs inspector reasonable for your own use for the period you 're going to be there . If you 're going on to the continent you can pay duty on your extra cigarettes , leave them with customs , pick them up when you leave Britain , and have your duty refunded on the spot ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , you can take in with you no more than five pounds in British currency but an unlimited amount of American money , provided none of it is in bills larger than twenty dollars . You can bring with you up to fifty pounds of food , either for your own use or as gifts , but not more than ten pounds of any one foodstuff. // Leaving the country you can take with you no more than five pounds in British currency and no more than ten pounds ' worth of foreign cur rency unless you brought it in with you and had it noted on your passport . Far more perplexing than any British regulation is their system of currency . It 's been going on that way for almost a thousand years , though , so it 's too late to do anything about it . Thus you 'd better try to under-stand it . The equivalents are based on the rates since devaluation : Just to make things a little more complicated , a pound , which contains twenty shillings , is referred to frequently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we call a dollar a buck . However , two or more pounds are n't referred to as " quids " ? it 's two or three quid . And a shilling is a bob , two shillings are two bob ( rarely if ever called a florin ) . Perhaps you 'll hear of a sum amounting to a guinea or two guineas . There 's no such coin or banknote as a guinea . It amounts to one pound plus one shilling , and it 's used customarily on the bills of doctors , lawyers ( called " solicitors " ? though they do n't solicit ? and " barristers " ) and other professional people . And even though there 's a half-crown you 'll find no such coin as a crown anymore . It disappeared from circulation about fifty years ago . Now you know all about British currency .

Footnote FOR YOUR LONDON ADDRESS BOOK : Jot down the names of friends you want to look up in Britain in that notebook we decided to buy back in // Chapter Five . Here is an additional list with the addresses of organizations you may well want to consult at some time during your stay . CHAPTER TWO The Paris of France IF THERE 'S one single spot on earth which symbolizes " going abroad " for most Americans that spot is Paris . Generations of visiting American writers , painters , musicians , and tourists have made it so that if you 've never been to Paris , you 're not really considered a traveler ? no matter where else on the globe you might have been . Conversely , a person is frequently rated as well-traveled by his friends if he can pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champs Elysees , la Tour d'Argent , even though he may have spent only two weeks in Paris , and never been anyplace else on his trip abroad . PARIS is unique , in the true , absolute sense of the word . France is a country , and there arc other countries . Paris is more than just a city , though . It 's a state of mind , an exhilaration of spirit , and there is nothing quite like it . Whenever people want to be a bit gaudy about their home town , or writers get stuck in trying to describe a place they like , they 're likely to call it the Paris of something or other . Thus you 've probably heard Havana called the Paris of the West Indies , Buenos Aires the Paris of South America , and Montreal the Paris of French Canada . Once I even heard a homesick GI refer to his native Joplin as the Paris of southwestern Missouri . Each of these cities has its own particular attractions . ( And you 'll be reading about Havana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant reference to Paris indicates the position the French capital occupies as the place most people would go to if they could . Even if you never go anyplace else on your travels overseas , I 'd recommend that you put Paris at the head of your list . Nowhere else I know can give you in such short order the feeling of being abroad , of realizing a dream you 've cherished most of your life . More Americans , probably , have written about Paris and painted Paris scenes than any other place on earth , so the sights , sounds , and street names will be familiar to you without your consciously remembering them . You 've undoubtedly been absorbing the lore of Paris , almost as if by osmosis , since you were old enough to see a movie , or advanced enough to read a book . In other words , this ? ladies and gentlemen ? is it . This is the " abroad " that has so much glamor . This is what most people are thinking of when they talk about " going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traveler and citizen of the world . Everybody who has ever been to Paris is said to have two homes forever after ; his own and Paris . Now let 's see about this very important business of making Paris your second home ? and making you at home in Paris . // WHAT TO DO : Mapping out a what-to-do program for a visitor to Paris is something like writing a set of instructions on how to make love to a beautiful woman . You either know all about it or you do n't know anything ? and it 's a difficult subject to learn by reading about it . Nevertheless , I want first to get some of the feel , sound , taste , and smell of the city across to you ? and perhaps in doing that we can work out an itinerary that will bring the magic of Paris to your senses in the shortest possible time . First thing to do in thinking about your visit to Paris is to listen to a good recording of George Gershwin 's " An American In Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the music ? the busyness of the place , the honking of the taxi horns , the sense of nostalgia many people feel in the presence of so much beauty and gaiety . In fact , the record is playing for me now ? as I try to recall the things you 'd want to be sure to see sometime during your visit , no matter how short . Well , you 'll want to walk along the Champs Elysees on a sunny Sunday morning . A Sunday walk on the Champs Elysees is to the Parisian what a bull fight is to a Mexican , or a baseball game is to Americans in hundreds of cities all over the United States . Begin your walk at the Arc de Triomphe at the Etoile ? so you 'll be able to make most of your long walk downhill . Your starting place will be Napoleon 's greatest monument to himself ? the gigantic Arch of Triumph honoring the victories of his Grande Armee , set in the middle of a great star , from which radiate twelve of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arch is the tomb of the Unknown Soldier , with its eternal flame . This is the focal point of many of the city 's parades and patriotic demonstrations . After a look up at the list , inscribed on the arch , of battles and generals whose names have become more and more meaningless with the years , you 'll probably make some pertinent mental notes about the futility , the impermanence and the unimportance of glory , war , and conquest compared with the reality of the bustling life you 'll see all about you as you start your walk down the Champs Elysees . You join the Sunday crowds swirling past the swank auto showrooms where some of the most luxurious cars in the world are on display , and you realize that while we in America can make more things for more people more cheaply than anybody else in the world , something must be sacrificed to mass-production , and that something is high-styling . And now you begin to understand what it is that makes Paris one of the great style and shopping capitals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the huge and glittering cafes ; Le Triomphe , Fouquet 's famous restaurant , the Select , Colisee and Marignan ; the theaters and the shops , but you do n't feel like a stranger , somehow , because everybody 's doing the same thing . All Parisians arc tourists in their native city ? in their spare time they do most of the things that you , a visitor from overseas , do on your first visit . That 's part of the magic of Paris , it never loses its charm and its infinite appeal for men and women who like to walk slowly in the sunshine or the rain . About a half mile down the Champs Elysees , at the end of the downhill // grade , you come to the Rond-Point ? which means Round Point ? and how a point can be round is something nobody in Paris has ever been able to explain to my satisfaction . In any case , the Rond-Point has some lovely fountains and flower beds and marks the end of the shopping part of the Champs Elysees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another half mile or so , flanked by some fine homes and public buildings , and the Seine for part of its length . Here you 'll see some of the world 's best-dressed and best-behaved children riding ponies and gravely regarding marionette shows . As one whose shins have been bruised by scores of children of American friends and relatives , I have been unceasingly amazed by the way the French keep their kids in line without feeding them soporifics . They may drug them , at that , for all I know . Along this part of the Champs Elysecs you 'll pass the Presidential Palace and the American Embassy , coming into the end of the Champs Elysees at the world 's loveliest square ? the Place de la Concorde . Few places in Paris have changed less in appearance in the past century . Here you 'll see the twin buildings of the Hotel Crillon and the Marine Ministry proudly bearing the scars of the fight for liberation that took place in the square in August 1944 . Concorde means agreement and harmony in French , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1770 , twelve hundred Parisians were killed and three thousand injured here in a panic set off by a discharge of rockets in honor of the marriage of Louis XVI to Marie Antoinette . Later the King and Queen were among the first to die when a guillotine was set up in the square during the French Revolution , and almost three thousand heads rolled within the next two years . It was here , too , that Paris mobs rioted when the police prevented their march on the Chamber of Deputies across the river at the time of the Stavisky scandal which rocked the Republic back in 1934 . Today , though , you 'll find everything peaceful . Even the omnipresent auto horns quiet down as the stream of traffic widens into the great square . If you 're getting tired by now you can take a small detour to the left and stop in at Webers or one of the other cafes on the Rue Royale for coffee or an aperitif . Walking up the Rue Royale , you 'll pass Maxim 's , which enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Hermann Goering sort of spoiled it by adopting it as his favorite during the City of Light 's four years of darkness . All that is pretty well forgotten by now , together with the rest of the bad dreams of the black years of the occupation , and when you think of Maxim 's past , you 're much more likely to remember that Franz Lchar wrote his Merry Widow operetta about Maxim 's . The original French title of the work was " La Dame de Chcz Maxim . " At the head of the street you 'll see the famous Church of the Madeleine , on which work was started under Louis XV in 1764 and completed in 1842 , after Napoleon and another Louis or two all had their hand in changing the design . Save a visit to the Madeleine for another walk , though . Getting back on your route , you 'll double back along the Rue Royale into the Place de la Concorde again and head for the Louvre Museum , either along the arcaded Rue de Rivoli or through the Tuileries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows of smart shops // or gaze at statuary and ruminate on the foibles and the fates of emperors and empires . Either way , you pass through the Place du Carrousel and see another Arc de Triomphe erected by the ever-modest Napoleon to commemorate his victories . The Louvre is a huge horseshoe-shaped building in which ? if you 're a lover of art or a browser among the ancients ? you could happily spend your entire vacation abroad . With an embarrassed cough in the direction of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York , the British Museum in London , and the museums which are the entire cities of Rome and Florence , I 'd like to venture the opinion that the Louvre is probably the most interesting museum in the Western world . The oldest existing wing of the Louvre was built by Francis I about 1546 ? if you 're impressed by antiquity ? and this was constructed on the foundations of the original Louvre which was built about 1200 . The Louvre you 'll see was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France , and the older sections are considered to be among the finest examples of French Renaissance architecture . I do n't know how many miles of galleries are contained in this magnificent and enormous building , it has been estimated at something like sixteen miles , but I do know that I 'd rather try walking from the Battery to the Bronx in my native New York than to undertake a complete hike through the building . If you want to engage in a little harmless namedropping you can say that Francis I , Charles V , Catherine de ' Medici , Henry IV , Louis XIII , Louis XIV , and Napoleon all played important parts in building the Louvre , adding new wings , and remodeling the vast palace . You 'll find on sale at the museum guidebooks of the Louvre larger than this volume , so I wo n't even try to describe the treasures that await you there . You 'll be tempted to call off the rest of your day 's sight-seeing and stay right where you arc . Do n't . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two at the Louvre at a time . Do , instead , as the Parisians do ? spend an hour or so there every day you 're in the vicinity . On your first visit you could concentrate on seeing the Winged Victory , Mona Lisa , and the Venus de Milo or on any one of them , sitting on one of the benches considerately placed nearby and thanking the fates that let you gaze uninterruptedly at these masterpieces in their original form at last . You 'll get more out of it this way , rather than trying to skim the surface and see as much as you can at one time . Coming out of the Louvre , you 'll walk along the quais of the Seine and browse among the bookstalls ? just as you 've seen pictures of other people browsing there for as long as you can remember . You 'll watch the patient fishermen who fish and fish and never seem to catch anything . And if you come there often enough you 'll find out that it is a fine appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river as much as if not more than the desire to catch any fish . Crossing the Pont Neuf , or New Bridge , so-called because it was finished as recently as the first part of the seventeenth century , you 're on the Ile de la cite , site of the original city of Paris of the thirteenth century . You 'll walk into the square before the Cathedral of Notre Dame , and you 'll see // the shell holes made in the thick stone walks of Police Headquarters when the Germans tried to batter their way in with tanks during the street fighting which accompanied the liberation in August 1944 . You 'll understand , too , why Parisians have a strong affection for their policemen who , when the chips were down , threw in their lot with the people , and fought the Germans in the streets . You 'll sec many a plaque set up in the walls of buildings and dedicated to a " guardian of the peace " who fell at that spot in the fight against the invader . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave Notre Dame for the afternoon ? you 'll be ready to call it a day of sight-seeing after you 've gone through the cathedral after lunch ? and cross another bridge to the Left Bank . Here you can eat at the , magnificent Tour d'Argent , where lunch can cost you $1z ? and be worth every cent of it . My favorite restaurant around this section is the Boutcillc d'Or , or Golden Bottle , which started back in the thirteenth century as an inn on the highroad to Paris and where ? despite all the antiquity and the atmosphere ? you can get a wonderful lunch with wine for about $1.50 . The morning 's promenade described above is just one of my favorite walks . Everybody who has spent any time iii Paris has his own beloved itineraries , and the city offers endless opportunities for walking and easygoing sight-seeing . You 'll be developing your own pet routes before you 're there a week . Whatever walks you take , and whether you do your sightseeing on your own or on one or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , afternoon , and at night , be sure you sec most of the following before you leave town . The Place Vendome , the Rue de la Paix , Avenue de l'Opera , Rue de Faubourg St. Honore , and Rue St. Honore ? these are the smartest shopping streets . The famous Grands Boulevards ? the Boulevard de la Madeleine , Boulevard des Capucines , Boulevard des Italiens , Boulevard Montmartre , Boulevard Poissonniere , Boulevard St. Denis , and Boulevard St. Martin . They are really one wide avenue about two and one half miles long ? each beginning where the other ends ? and form a great chain of shops , department stores , theaters , and cafes . And you can add to your stock of useless but impressive-sounding information the fact that the French word " boulevard " and our " bulwark " stem from the same roots , since the boulevards were created when the great walls of medieval Paris were torn down and wide streets laid out in their place . The Bois de Boulogne and the Luxembourg Gardens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge place , with lakes and ponds , lovely drives , race tracks , and fine restaurants . All of Paris , or so it seems , will be in the Bois on a fine Sunday afternoon ? those who are n't promenading on the Champs Elysees . The Luxembourg Gardens are a quiet haven for lovers , kids with their governesses , and people who want to sit in the sunshine with a book . Monuments . The Eiffel Tower , of course . And the Hotel des Invalidcs . Not a pension for sick people , as you might imagine from the name , but a monument and resting place for French military heroes . Napoleon 's tomb is the piece de resistance . // The Flea Market . Said to have been a thieves ' market originally . Now it 's probably the world 's largest acreage of second-hand furniture , gewgaws , gimcracks , and whatnots . Sometimes you can pick up a real bargain there ? more often you ca n't , but going to the Flea Market on Sunday morning has been a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years or so . The Opera . You ca n't miss seeing the building , since the Place de l'Opera is the heart of Paris . Gala performances are among the high spots of the capital 's social season . Les Halles ? the Paris food markets . You 'll be amazed at the artistry with which carrots , turnips , beans , and other seemingly unglamorous vegetables can be displayed . And the onion soup in the little restaurants at four in the morning is something to stay up for . Not that the people you 'll meet there at four in the morning are up at that hour because of the soup . They 're either farmers or market workers taking a snack in the middle of their working day , or revelers following the Parisian tradition of ending an evening 's fun at Les Hanes . Churches . Notre Dame is the most famous , and you 'll want to spend at least an hour or so there . The view of the roofs of Paris and the Seine from the towers is one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character out of the Middle Ages as you look out into the narrow streets of medieval Paris below . La Ste. Chapelle is one of the finest specimens of ornamental Gothic architecture in existence . St. Germain des Preis , built in 542 , is one of the oldest in Paris . Sacre Coeur , a fairly new church ( it was consecrated in 1891 ) , is of Byzantine architecture and stands atop the hill of Mont-martre , which gives you another of the most spectacular views of Paris . This one 's a large-scale job , though , as you 're very high up . You 'll see the Eiffel Tower , Notre Dame , the Seine , and other landmarks of your sight-seeing expeditions as Paris stretches at your feet like an illustration from a fifth-grade geography . Incidentally , Sacre Coeur 's foundations go deeper than its height . Montmartre . Right at the side of Sacre Coeur is a little village that has survived the centuries in the midst of Paris . It 's the butte or hill section of Montmartre . I-Iere , on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the surrounding restaurants put out their tables on summer nights . The streets of Montmartre , painted in such detail by Maurice Utrillo , will look more like the mental images you 've had of Paris than any other section of town . The whole district reminds you of a mural on one side of a French restaurant in the East 5os in New York . Sight-seeing ? even by car ? is usually a dry ( in the physical sense ) and tiring business , so before you 're in Paris very long you 'll find that you 've developed the cafe habit . When you do that you 'll really be chez vous-at home in Paris . Cafe-sitting will probably seem a rather vapid sort of diversion for the average American visitor just off the boat or plane and supercharged with a colossal compulsion to see things fast and get things done in a hurry . Then , as Paris really begins to seep through to him , he will start worrying about how he is going to find time to do all the sitting he 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over an aperitif or a cup of // coffee on a stone-topped table he will read , drowse , philosophize , conduct much of his business , discuss the lamentable state of world affairs , argue with his wife or court his mistress , and watch the world go by . There are all sorts of cafes to suit all sorts of tastes , and sooner or later you 'll find one that just fits your background , personality , propensities , proclivities , and predilections . There arc the big and shiny places we mentioned above ? the cafes with broad terraces along the Champs Elysees and the Grands Boulevards . These include the Triomphe , Select , Colisee , Marignan , and the Cafe de la Paix across the street from the Opera , where ? according to the cliche ? sooner or later you 'll sec everyone in the world . Which is probably why sage Frenchmen leave it pretty much to the visiting Americans during the height of the summer tourist season . All the aforementioned cafes are on the right bank , where you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Left Bank cafes and you 're more in the heart of the real Paris . There 's the Cafe du Dome , which was home to a whole generation of American expatriates during the years between the wars . ' There , in the old days , you 'd find Ernest Hemingway , Henry Miller , Edmond " Taylor , Waverley Root , Jay Allen , Elliot Paul , Gertrude Stein , Leland Stowe , and the rest of the American literati . Later , some of the group split off and started patronizing the Coupolc next door . Visit the Cafe dc Fiore , and you 'll find Picasso there , holding court as he has many evenings for the past fifteen years , or you 'll sec jean-Paul Sartre and sonic of his Existentialist disciples . In the same neighborhood , facing famous old St. Germain des Pros , is the Cafe Aux Deux Magots , also an excellent place for studying your soul and seeing some of the hardworking young poets and painters and philosophers whose names might be familiar to you a decade hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion . More than likely you 'll settle down in some unknown little cafe in a side street , probably near your hotel . One day the owner will decide you 're a fairly " chic type , " despite your atrocious accent , the patronne will take you to her capacious bosom , and that cafe will be your home for as many days , or years , as you remain in Paris . You 'll meet your friends there , get your mail and make your phone calls , and you 'll cat there on credit when you 're broke . , %5 ' EXCURSIONS FROM PARIS : Versailles on a Sunday is another standard outing for Parisians and their visitors from the provinces and overseas . The chateau and its surrounding gardens and parks are magnificent museums of life under the Louis , and the chateau itself is full of historic associations of more recent vintage , such as the signing in the Hall of Mirrors of the peace treaty which ended ? people thought ? the world war . Fontainebleau is something like Versailles , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same , but the closest to Paris . At Compiegne is the site of the German surrender in 1918 and the scene of Hitler 's revenge in 1940 , in the same railroad car . Chateau-Thierry and nearby Belleau Wood mark America 's entrance onto the stage of world // military power , when the A.E.F. under Pershing fought great battles there in 1918 . Rheims is the heart of the champagne country , there 's a magnificent cathedral , and also the little red schoolhouse that was Eisenhower 's headquarters until the Germans signed their unconditional surrender there . If it 's cathedrals you want to see then do n't miss going to Chartres , where the thirteenth-century structure is reputed to be the purest example of Gothic architecture . v WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK : One of the quickest ways to start an argument among your friends who have been to Paris is to ask them to recommend the best Parisian restaurants to you . Everyone has his own special spots , and nobody ever agrees as to what are the best in town . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cooled you 'll find you can make peace with the statement that Paris has more good restaurants than any place else in the world . They 'll all be able to agree on that , which after all , is the important point . It 's practically impossible to find a really bad restaurant in Paris or to eat a truly bad meal . And you do n't judge a restaurant by its exterior , either . Some of the finest kitchens in Paris are concealed by the least pretentious facades . Paris is one of the few places in the world where you can stop for lunch or dinner wherever and whenever you find yourself hungry , stop at the first restaurant on the street that looks good , and be assured of an excellent meal . What do I mean by " looks good " ? Well , first take a look at the window . If the menu is pasted up on the glass then you wo n't be subjected to any unpleasant surprises when the garcon presents you with the check . Government edict divides restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C , and D. If the menu lists the restaurant as category A or B you 're practically assured of a superb meal , and if it states that the maison was fondee back thirty or forty years ago you can be sure it 's a solid establishment . Does the fruit arranged on a table in the center of the room look fresh and appetizing , or tired and dispirited ? If you can see the pastry or an hors d'oeuvres table and the food looks good then it will be good . If you ca n't see any of the food take a look at the waiters . Do they look as though they meant to be waiters and were glad of it , or do they give the impression that they 're just waiting around until something good opens up in the undertaking business ? Never mind being overfinicky about the sparkling variety of cleanliness ? most good French restaurateurs are more concerned with the excellence of their cuisine than with the extreme cleanliness of their establishments . The important question about the waiters ' appearance is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food to knowing people . How about the customers ? Do they seem like good people of the neighborhood , accustomed to eating there because they know the food is good ? And do they appear to be enjoying their meals ? By this time the patron will have observed your careful surveillance , he will have spotted you as a true connoisseur and gourmet , and he will trot out his finest specialties to titillate your cultivated palate . // Getting down to cases , here are some of my favorite restaurants . Many of them have been doing business since well before either of us were born , so you can be reasonably sure they 'll still be there , and worth going to , by the time you get to Paris . Champs Elysees ? Place de la Concorde area : Fouquet 's , 99 Champs Elysees ( old , famous , expensive , and stays open late ) ; Korniloff , lo Rue Jean Mermoz ( Russian ) ; Relais du Plaza-Athencc , 21 Ave . Montaigne ( at the hotel , tops for late dinners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marbeuf ( Italian ) ; La Cremaillere , 92 Faubourg St. Honore ; Larue , 3 Place de la Madeleine ( old and celebrated ) ; Lucas-Carton , 9 Place de la Madeleine ; Maxim 's , 3 Ruc Royale ( mentioned a few pages back ) ; Auberge de la Truite , 30 Faubourg St. Ilonore ; Le Cabaret , 4 Ave . F. D. Roosevelt ; Chcz Doucet , 4 Rue Marbeuf , is one of a chain of good , quite inexpensive restaurants which serve excellent meals for the price . Lescure , at 7 Rue Mondovi , is a little bistro with red-checked tablecloths and no atmosphere , where you can get a very good lunch for less than a dollar , with wine . One of the cheapest of the good restaurants ? or one of the best of the cheap places ? it 's a favorite with the lesser lights of the American Embassy around the corner . Opera and points cast : Cafe dc Paris , 41 Ave . do l'Opera ( expensive but excellent ) ; Grand Vcfour , 17 Ruc Beaujolais ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alsacicnne , 27 Ruc Sainte Appolinc ; Relais de la Belle Aurore , 6 Rue Gomboust ( French Revolution decorative motif , people from Commissariat Au Tourisme cat here , and they certainly ought to know ) . Best among the less expensive in this neighborhood include Pharamond , 24 Rue Grande-Truanderic ( Normandy specialties and famous for its tripes a la mode de Caen ) ; Au Roy Gourmet , 4 Place des Victoires ( steaks ) ; Auberge Landaise , 35 Rue Palestro ; La Grille , 50 Rue Montorgueil ; and Flambaum , 37 Rue du Faubourg-Montmartre ( Jewish specialties ) . Montmartre : Cochon d'Or , 192 Ave . Jean Jaures ; Aristes , 11 Ruc Lepic ; Chez la Mere Catherine , 6 Rue Norvins ( the archetypical red-checkedtableclothed restaurant of old Montmartre , doing business at the same stand for more than one hundred and fifty years ) . Left Bank : Tour d'Argent , 15 Quai de la Tournellc ( probably the most famous restaurant in town , expensive ? its specialty is pressed duckling ) ; Laperouse , 51 Quai des Grands-Augustins ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perigourdine , 2 Place St. Michel ; Rotonde Montparnasse , 105 Boulevard Montparnasse ; La Coupole , 102 Boulevard Montparnasse ; La Bouteille d'Or , 9 Quai Montebello ( described a few pages back ? at the end of your Sunday morning 's walk ) . In the Bois : Pavilion d'Armenonville ( expensive but lovely ) , open May through September ; Pavillon Royal ( mid-April through October ) ; PreCatalan ( least expensive in the Bois ) . t HOW TO BE MERRY : You 'll want to know about the night life for which Paris is famous . Start off an evening with one of the music halls : the Folies Bergere , Casino de Paris , A.B.C. , Alcazar , or some place like that . Orchestra seats run about $2.00 . Ticket brokers charge about // 50 cents for booking seats , and it 's wise to buy your seats from a broker , as theaters and music halls are scattered all over town , and you 'd run yourself ragged going to box offices . The ticket agency in the Lido arcade at 78 Champs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . She speaks English . Paris music halls , or varietes , are long famous for the elaborateness of their presentations . The French demand lots of entertainment for their money , so shows begin at 8:30 and last until 11:30 or later . By that time your head is vibrating , your ears are echoing and you are surfeited even with so much beauty , color , and light . After the music hall the usual itinerary would take you to a night club . Probably the most famous boite in Paris is the Bal Tabarin in Montmartre , where they 've danced the cancan ever since Napoleon was a corporal . The show at the Tabarin is still terrific ; gals wearing long blond wigs and shy smiles ride on prancing white plaster horses that rise up from a sunken stage , gals in long ruffled skirts leap into the air and land in a split , banging their foreheads against the floor as they come down , gals ? period . If you sit at a table you 'll find a bottle of champagne already chilling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sandwich will run you about $3.00 . What with tax , 15 per cent tip , and one thing and another , the bill for two persons for an evening at one of the representative Parisian night clubs will run about $30 . Stand at the bar , if you 're a man ( women visitors should n't ) , and you 'll pay about $1.25 per glass of cognac , get nagged by hostesses to buy them a drink , and shoved around by the milling mob , mostly Americans , since the average Frenchman is too smart to distribute his income in this uneconomic manner . This is pretty much the picture at most of the larger and brighter Paris night clubs . These include the Bceuf Sur Le Toit ( or Bull on the Roof ) , Lido , Tyrol , and Triomphe in the Champs Elysees district as well as the larger flashier neon-lighted spots in Montmartre . While you 're in Montmartre though , you might want to wander into one or two of the little clubs along the Rue Pigalle , the famous " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two wars . Some of these are more or less minor-league clip-joints , but it 's all part of seeing the night sights , and you can always have one drink and leave , without too much financial damage . One Montmartre place which is very definitely not a clip-joint , where the " atmosphere " is authentic and which has been in operation at the same location for fifty years or more is Au Lapin Agile ( At the Agile Rabbit 's ) , an establishment of low lights , low ceilings , low tables , and low prices . I ca n't remember whether they have candles on the initialscarred tables , but if they do n't they should have . It 's that sort of place . People from around the neighborhood ( the Lapin Agile is up on the butte of Montmartre ) drop in to sing old French folk songs ? some of them are more ribald than folksy ? and recite their poems . The songs arc good and so are most of the voices of the entertainers who sing them . To know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert knowledge of French , so the poetry should n't affect you too much , one way or the other . Even more atmospheric , though somewhat synthetic , is La Bolee , near // the Boulevard St. Michel , on the Left Bank . It was a dungeon where prisoners were kept before the Revolution , and one section is maintained as it was , a barred cell . You can peek in through the bars and see a dummy representing the bloodstained body of a defunct revolutionist stretched out on his bunk ( very scary ) . In the main room candles set in skulls flicker at you from the sweating stone walls ( you 're about three stories underground ) while singers sing of old France and the lives and loves of another time . ( Seems like they did just about the same old things in the good old days . ) Another type of Paris night spot that 's very popular is the intimate sort of place ? not always small ? where the orchestra ( frequently Russian or gypsy ) is likely to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulate among the cash customers . Night clubs of this type are apt to come and go almost as frequently as the bop-joints on New York 's Fiftysecond Street , but among those which have more or less become landmarks are Monseigneur , Le Drap d'Or , and Sclichcrazadc . If you do n't want to go down to the market for onion soup you 'll probably end up your big evenings at IIarry 's New York Bar , a Paris-American institution , at 5 Rue Daunou , near the Opera . " Just tell the cabdriver sank-roodoe-noo ' " Americans in Paris have been instructed iii thousands of small ads in the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribunc ? and hundreds of thousands of visitors over many years have obeyed instructions . % ? t ) FOR TILE SPORTSMAN AND SPORTSWOMAN : Paris has never been known particularly for its outdoor sports , but there 's plenty going on ? if that 's what you came to Paris for . I-Iorse racing is probably the most popular spectator sport around Paris , with meetings held frequently throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulogne ; and at nearby Chantilly , St. Cloud , Vincennes , Enghien , MaisonsLaffitte , Rambouillet , and Evreux . Important international football ( soccer ) matches are held at the Colombes Stadium on Sunday afternoons , and at the same time , top European rugby teams are meeting at the Stade Jean-Bouin near by . The Paris-American colony supplies a good part of the clientele of the excellent golf course at St. Cloud . If you like to watch tennis there are usually some French and European champions playing at the Racing Club in the Bois during the summer season . For the most part , though , sporting Parisians go away for their outdoor activities ? to the Alps and Pyrenees for skiing and winter sports ; the Riviera , Biarritz , and Deauville for yachting ; Brittany for tuna fishing , or down to Arles and Montpellier for the bullfights . Since the bicycle is an important means of transportation for French workers , the French , naturally enough , are great cyclists . Young people go cycling around the country on their holidays , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're seeing the country a-cycle or on a walking trip . WHAT TO WEAR : Paris has been the capital of high fashion for women since well before the Forty-niners carried five-year-old copies of Paris gowns in their covered wagons to dazzle the ladies of the Pacific // coast . Many American women visitors might choose to travel light and use their luggage weight and customs allowance mostly for clothes they 'll buy in Paris . You 'll want to bring a few of your smartest things to wear while you 're being outfitted , though , as you 'll ' find the upper-class Parisians around you are nearly always beautifully dressed . Choose the sort of clothes you 'd wear while visiting your smartest friends in New York ? plus a good serviceable suit and comfortable shoes for your sight-seeing around and about . Men need n't worry so much about looking like somebody 's ashamed-of cousin from somewhere they do n't like to think about . Frenchmen have always seemed to lack the chic which so distinguishes their women ? though chic is hardly the word to characterize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always envied in the British and , latterly , us . Just as you do in England , you 're likely to need a raincoat at any time in Paris . But you wo n't have to worry about extremely cold days in winter , or very hot ones in summer . Look at the record ( in Fahrenheit ) : The average high is indicative of the sort of daytime weather they have . Most of the European capitals are " dressing " as much as they did before the war . Paris is no exception . As a matter of fact you 'll need dinner and evening clothes more in Paris than in any other city of Europe ? and that means more , too , than almost any city in the States , except New York . So , unless luggage weight and space are serious prob lems , be sure to pack evening clothes , if you expect to go out much at night ? and who visits Paris without expecting a great many gala evenings ? ( In midsummer , however , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are advisable . ) Laundry service in Paris is back to normal , so you need n't carry the quantities of personal linen which were necessary on visits during the early postwar years . And that should make some weight and space available for those evening clothes . For daytime men will wear business suits more frequently and sport jacket and slacks combinations less than in London , or some of the less formal continental cities . Remember that Paris is smart , sophisticated , // mundane ? and dress accordingly . Save your sports outfits for junkets out to the surrounding countryside ? Versailles , Fontainebleau , St. Germain , Chantilly , etc. e-4 WHAT TO BUY : Just about anything that 's luxurious or highly styled , and articles requiring fine workmanship . Best buys in Paris , compared with American prices for their counterparts , are perfumes . American customs restrictions vary with the brands , but most of the salespeople in the large perfume shops in Paris can advise you as to the current regulations . In general , the customs regulations arc designed to allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own use , or as gifts , while preventing you from importing perfume for resale without paying the prescribed duty . Therefore you are limited on the number of bottles of any particular brand you can bring in . But check with the salesgirl at the perfume counter . And buy your perfume at one of the Paris department stores or one of the good perfume shops in the regular shopping districts . ( The Commissariat General an Tourisme , 8 Avenue de l'Opera , will recommend reputable shops to you . ) Do n't try to save a few francs by going to so-called cut-price places . Even at the most expensive shops , you 'll be so far ahead of American prices for French perfumes anyway that it wo n't be worth your while to go to cheaper places . And you 'll be dependent on the salesgirl 's recommendations to a great degree , unless you 're a woman who knows exactly what she wants , or a man with a specific list of perfumes to bring back for his family and friends . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patou , Worth , Lcntheric , Schiaparelli , Houbigant , Lanvin , Caron , Molyncux , Millot , Marcel Rochas , Coty , Guerlain , and Chanel . The average woman will go into a prolonged ecstatic frenzy ? which is as excited a phrase as I can whip up at the moment ? over the lingerie , bags , scarves , and jewelry she will find in the best shops along the Rue de Rivoli , Rue de Castiglione , Place Vendome , Rue de la Paix , Boulevard des Capucines , Boulevard de la Madeleine , Rue Royale , Rue St. Honore , Rue du Faubourg St. Honor-6 , and Champs Elysees . Handmade blouses by " little dressmakers " have been prized trophies displayed by American women returning from Paris for many years . It 's a lot harder now to find " little dressmakers " than it was before the war , but even at the smart shops you 'll be able to have fine blouses made to order for far less than you 'd have to pay at home ? assuming you could get anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris ? and most American shoppers in Paris are slightly hysterical ? will find a friend , confidant , and aide-de-camp in Charlie Blair , who understands them because he is a slightly hysterical American himself . Blair is a slender , clapper , somewhat nervous bachelor who would consider it a major crime against society to appear in public incorrectly dressed . Thus he has lived in Paris for a quarter-century ? taking time out for the German occupation ? with three bags packed and waiting in his room against the day when he must flee the city in the face of war , revolution , or act of God . One bag is for escape // through Holland , one is in case he must ski his way through Switzerland , and the other is to be used if he must save himself via the South of France . The last contains , among other effects , swim trunks . Blair is the owner of the Maison Scherick , at 374 Rue St. Honore . He sells beautiful and expensive handbags and scarves , and he gives away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on around town . Women will also have a wonderful time buying hats and umbrellas , which come graceful , slim , and colorful . Compacts , cigarette cases and holders ? especially the expensive ones ? are very beautiful . For the home you might want to buy some of the fine Limoges china , Lalique , and St. Gobain glassware . And it 's just possible that you may pick up some good buys in bric-a-brae at the Flea Market . Men wo n't be able to enjoy the same frenetic shopping spree in Paris that women do . In the first place , most men do n't get the huge kick that women do out of shopping in general . Secondly , the picking is n't as good . Best masculine bets are the male counterparts of the feminine delicacies listed above . Jewelry ? and for men that means cuff links , studs , collar and tie pins , key chains , money clips , belt buckles , cigarette cases and holders . Gloves are an excellent buy , so are men 's umbrellas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you 'll find made-to-measure shirts considerably cheaper than back home . You 'll discover good values , too , in the custom-made shirts you can get through the more expensive shops . Higherpriced ties , too , are usually worth the price in Paris . French suspenders and garters are very good also . Do n't make the mistake of buying a hat in Paris . It might look fine on the boulevards , but when you wear it at home it probably will have a " foreign look " about it that you wo n't like . Brims have a tendency to be narrow and dinky . , -. sc " j WHERE TO STAY : Paris has at least fifty good hotels , many of them unknown to visiting Americans . French hotels are officially divided into four categories : de luxe and first , second and third class . I 've found that the first-class hotels generally lack only a touch of the added swank provided by the palaces . Rates at the de luxe hotels , for a single room with bath , run between $7.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firstclass hotels you 'll pay about $5.00 per day for a single , with bath . These rates include all taxes , but do not include the 15 per cent service charge . They are European plan ( without meals ) . Despite the strenuous efforts of the French National Tourist Office to require hotelkeepers to remain within the price brackets quoted for their categories , a number of reports have been received of overcharging of Americans during the record summer season of 1949 , mostly by the de luxe hotels for suites and other top accommodations . Strong official action is being taken to stop this practice , and a report of an overcharge to the Commissariat General au Tourisme , 8 Avenue de l'Opera , will usually bring a quick rectification . Among the best-known de luxe hotels in Paris are the George V , Plaza Athenee , Royal-Monceau , and Prince de Galles in the Champs Elysees district ; the Crillon at the Place de la Concorde ; and the Ritz and Meurice in the Opera section . Last time I was in Paris I stayed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superb in every respect . The service , appointments , food , and general atmosphere were all back to their excellent prewar standards which distinguished Paris as a luxury capital . Do n't forget that some of the finest of the very fine restaurants of Paris are the hotel dining rooms . Among the best are George V , Plaza Athenee , Ritz , Claridge , Meurice and Royal-Monceau . First-class hotels which have long been popular among Americans include the Astoria , Claridge , Continental , Grand , Napoleon Bonaparte , Scribe , Vendome , Westminster , and California . The Lutctia has always been a favorite of the Left Bank cognoscenti . During the war the California , on the Rue de Berri opposite the Paris Herald , was requisitioned first by the U.S. Army , then for the staff of the Stars and Stripes , next as a WAC billet , finally for United States civilians on official or semiofficial business . Thus it had coal during those first postwar winters when most other Paris hotels were cold . Americans got into the habit of staying there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's on the preferred list of visitors who like to stay at a hotel just below the luxury class . Americans visiting Paris on a budget have told me that the Louvois is excellent among the inexpensive hotels . Rates for a single room with bath start at about $3.50 per day . , , .. , . -f TIPS ON TIPPING : Practically all hotels add a service charge of 12 ? 15 per cent of the bill . That is supposed to take care of all usual services . However , you 're still expected to pass out a tip occasionally to a bellhop , chambermaid , or the doorman who calls a cab for you . Restaurants generally add a service charge also . If you 're in doubt ask whether the check includes service . If it does leave the change to the nearest fifty or a hundred francs anyhow . If not , tip 12 ? 15 per cent of the bill . In night clubs , better restaurants , or cafes , give the checkroom bandit fifty francs . In smaller places thirty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to the old lady who stands midway between the men 's and women 's sections of the washroom . Cab drivers expect at least 20 per cent of the meter reading as a tip . Cabs are still comparatively cheap , though , so it wo n't amount to too much . In France , theater and movie ushers are always tipped in addition to the price of the program , which is sold , not given away . A fifty-franc tip is about right . %sZ3 HOW TO GET THERE : For full information on schedules and reservations on transatlantic liners ? beyond that given in Chapter Eleven , Part I ? you will want to consult your travel agent . If you want to fly you have your choice of Trans World Airline , the American-flag carrier , and Air France . Both use Constellations , which make the flight from New York in about fifteen and one half hours , at fares of $370 one way , $666 round trip , $466 for the 6o-day round-trip excursion fare good between October 1 and April 30 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 and March 15 . Getting around France itself , to and from Paris , you have your choice of Air France , the French National Railroads , and their affiliated bus services . // You can fly from Paris to Dinard , Nantes , Bordeaux , Toulouse , Perpignan , Montpellier , Marseilles , Cannes , Nice , Monte Carlo , Lyons , Strasbourg , and Lille . Planes used in domestic service arc generally DC-3s , with few of the meals and other service frills you 've gotten used to on domestic flights here in the United States or on the transatlantic run . The French railroads , nationalized before the war , have recovered completely from their wartime devastation . They 've even instituted a new train that runs between Paris and Strasbourg , a distance of 315 miles , in five and one quarter hours ? on tires ! You can take your choice of three classes on most trains : first is generally quite luxurious and uncrowded ; second comfortable , usually clean , and not too overpopulated ; and third , which ranges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pretty-badly-beaten-up rattletraps , depending on the train and the run . Naturally , you 'll get the best equipment on the long-distance name trains , just as you do at home , while the railroads use up their old equipment on local and commuter runs . Most cars are divided into compartments , while some are open inside , along the lines of American cars . A special feature of the French National Railroads are the Autorails , fast and comfortable motor coaches which run on rails under their own power . They 're usually crowded , though , so it 's advisable to reserve your scats before you leave . First-class compartments consist of two long seats facing each other , with each seat divided into three sections ? the compartment , in other words , accommodating six passengers . Second-class compartments are similar , except that the upholstery and fittings are n't quite as de luxe , and the seats are divided into four sections , each compartment accommodating eight persons . An aisle runs the length of the car , outside the compartments , and second-class cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers and their luggage . Second class , though , is usually recommended for Americans keeping an eye on their budgets ? and nobody ever died from riding third . Sleeping-car accommodations are of two classes : couchettes , which consist of one long scat of a compartment , with the dividing armrests removed , and for which you are furnished blankets and pillows on the train ; and regular sleeping berths , corresponding to our Pullmans , operated by the Wagon-Lits Cook . In first class each berth is in its own compartment , but second-class berths are two to a compartment . Dining-car meals in France are generally simple , with a set menu , but relatively inexpensive , the average meal costing about $2.00 . Wine is extra . Before the meal is served , a dining-car steward goes through the train , passing out tickets for places in the diner , the color of the ticket denoting first or second service . Paris is the heart of France 's great rail network , with trains fanning out to all the country , the continent , and England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves from , when you use the French railroads , as most Americans are not accustomed to the idea of many railroad stations in the same city . Another confusing detail for Americans riding the European rails is the custom of examining your tickets at the gate of the station platform , while you 're on the train , and again as you leave the station platform at your destination . The last is particularly // annoying , since ? if you have n't absentmindedly thrown your ticket stub ' away , you 've stuck it into an inside pocket somewhere to leave your hands free to begin the battle of the bags before a porter shows up . French railroad faros are approximately z cents per mile second and 1Mo cents per mile third . Couchettes cost less than $2.00 in addition to the rail fare . Rates for sleepers vary according to the train . Second class on the famous Blue Train is about 112 cents per mile . The French National Railroads can suggest more than a hundred combined rail and motorcoach tours during the summer months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving the problem of how to combine the speed of train transportation with the sight-seeing advantages of highway travel . On these new trips you go from Paris to a provincial center , then take off in busses for tours through the surrounding countryside . One of the outstanding advantages of these trips is the fact that you can book them , pay for them , and make all transportation reservations at the office of the French National Railroads in New York . This simplifies your problems of budget , currency exchange , carrying of money , etc. , since you can arrange and pay for your meals and hotel accommodations for the duration of the tour at the same time as you buy your rail and bus tickets in New York through your travel agent . j RED TAPE : Down to a minimum for postwar Europe . You 'll need : 1 . A passport . 2 . A vaccination certificate ? not to go to France , but to get back into the United States . No visa is required of American citizens staying in France three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want into France but no dollars in bills larger than twenties ( American currency regulations ) and no more than 6o,000 francs . The devalued franc has been pegged at 350 to the dollar . When you enter France you must declare all the funds in your possession , including cash , travelers checks , and letters of credit . That amount is entered in your passport or declaration form given you by customs when you enter the country . Every time you change money at any bank , hotel , or other legal place of exchange , the transaction is recorded in your passport or declaration form . When you leave the country the amount you take out should represent the amount you brought in with you ? less the sums you changed legally , as recorded in your passport or declaration form .

CHAPTER THREE Riviera ? All-season Playground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country what Florida is to the rest of the United States ? only more so . Nice , in some ways , is Miami ? big , noisy , packed with action and with people during the height of the season ; a great pleasure capital offering just about everything a vacationist could want in entertainment , sports , and relaxation in the sun . Cannes is Palm Beach ? smaller , exclusive , headquarters for the yachting set and international society . The difference between the two cities was underlined during and immediately after the war when the Riviera was a great rest and leave area for the American forces . Nice was the enlisted man 's paradise , in those days , while Cannes was for officers only . ( Military caste lines were somewhat blurred , though , when some officers discovered that there were more pretty girls in Nice ? since it was by far the larger city ? and began invading the GI 's bailiwick . ) You can carry the Florida parallel too far , though . For one thing , you ca n't count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can in southern Florida . Nowhere else in the world , however , can you find so many varied attractions for the visitor as you can in the South of France . There are the quiet , almost sleepy , seaside towns of Menton , Cap d'Ail , Beaulieu , Cannes , Golfe Juan , La Napoule , Cavalaire , and Le Lavandou ; fishing towns like St. Tropcz and Villefranche , well-known resorts such as Antibes , Juan-les-Pins , St. Raphael , and Ste. Maximo . There 's Eden Roc , perhaps the last refuge of what the Sunday magazine writers like to call the Gilded Set , and Monte Carlo ? not in France but of it , in the separate little principality of Monaco . Moving inland , there 's Grasse , where the air is always scented with the fragrance of flowers being crushed in the perfume factories ; and the cloistered medievalism of Vence and St. Paul , up in the hills , where life walks with a slow and measured pace ? and you can live beautifully for a fraction of what it costs you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's even winter sport ? and fine winter sport , too ? in the lower Alps at such places as Peira-Cava , Auron , Beuil , and Valberg . The nearest snow resort is only twenty-five miles from the beaches where you can take a swim in the blue Mediterranean within an hour after you 've loosened the bindings of your skis , on a 49oo-foot mountain ? and most of the Riviera ski region is within fifty miles of the coast . WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO : You 'll have an unforgettable vacation no matter where you go on the Riviera . You may stop at one of the better-known and swankier resorts , or you may prefer one of the hamlets along the coast or one of the old towns in the hills where so // many writers and artists have settled down to live the good and quiet life . Tourist haunt or sun-spattered village , though , you 'll start dreaming of coming back some day as soon as you board the plane or train for your return to Paris or your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centers of life on the Cote d'Azur . With a population of three hundred thousand , it 's the sixth largest city of France ? larger than Miami and Miami Beach combined . Along the sea it has all the palm-treed glamour of the rest of the coast , and in the center of town there are substantial-looking streets and gray stone buildings that remind you somewhat of Paris . Its world-famous , palm-tree-lined Promenade des Anglais is flanked on one side by the pebbly beach and the aptly-named Bay of the Angels , and on the other by a line of luxury hotels and amusement places . Founded by the Greeks , captured by the Romans , owned by the French , and claimed by Mussolini , Nice was ceded to the United States soldier by the order which established it as a rest center during the last months of the war . After the war it remained a Mediterranean mecca for American occupation soldiers on leave . It will probably be your best headquarters on the Riviera , since it offers practically everything you 'll find anywhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to which it 's the center for all excursions to other seaside resorts and the neighboring countryside . In Nice the sunny Mediterranean temperament is nourished by rich , well-garlicked foods and watered by good red wine . Its carnival , held in January or February , combines elements of the New Orleans Mardi Gras and the carnival in Rio with a Gallic flavor and Italian spicing . Carnival features arc the famed Battle of Flowers , the naval flower battle at nearby Villefranche , the Parade of King Carnaval and his court through the Place Massena , dancing in the streets , and the Battle of Plaster , during which everybody wears old clothes and pelts his neighbor with pieces of chalk , and the white dust rising from the square makes the town look as though a real war was surging through the streets . Climax of the celebration comes when King Carnaval is burned on Shrove Tuesday . During carnival season visitors frequently wake up in the morning in the homes of the townspeople , the townspeople find themselves in the hotels of the visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community has had itself a magnificent time . Smaller than Nice , Cannes is considered smarter by the international playboys and playgirls who make the Cote d'Azur their winter headquarters between wars . It 's the capital of the Riviera 's British colony and the yachting center for the entire coast . Naturally , you 'll want to sec Monte Carlo , in Monaco . It 's only about ten miles from Nice and easily available by car , bus , or train . Monaco is an independent country with a national area of 370 acres , next to Vatican City the world 's smallest state . It is ruled by a prince whose line has governed the tiny country since the end of the thirteenth century . Monte Carlo is associated in the minds of most people with green baize gambling tables chaperoned by stony-faced croupiers whose voices betray no emotion as beautiful blondes with Viennese accents plunge the // last of their fortunes on a turn of the wheel , then leave the gaming rooms stunned and photogenically suicidal . It 's a colorful impression , much cultivated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note has been added recently by the introduction of " Ies craps " by the management after careful study of the tables at Las Vegas , Nevada . Monte Carlo is one of the luxest of the de luxe Riviera resorts , with many visitors there for the outdoor sports and the other amenities ? as well as quiet guys in business suits who haunt the roulette tables , trying to work out a system . You 'll want to spend a half day , at least , on an excursion to Grasse , twelve miles north of Cannes , where the streets all smell of flowers , and the people all smell of perfume . Here is the center of the French perfume industry , and most of the population works in the scent factories . Grasse is the core of a countryside planted with violets , tuberoses , mignonettes , jonquils , jasmine , and carnations . While you 're there you should visit a perfume factory to see essential oils distilled from the flowers . If your visit to the South of France is slated for any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Alpine winter sports on your schedule . You can drive up to Beuil or Valberg from Nice for some midday skiing , then be back on the beach for a late afternoon sun bath . Or you could stay awhile at the Grand Hotel at Valberg in a room with central heating , with hot and cold running water , for about seven to eight dollars a day with meals , tax and service included . Nearby are ski jumps , two lifts , and a flood-lighted skating rink . Twelve miles beyond Valberg is the plateau of Auron , which enjoys a late spring skiing season . Here are four Alpine runs , two beginners ' slopes , a cable railway , and a ski school . Closest winter sports area to Nice is Pcira Cava , where a number of good hotels serve as ski centers while offering magnificent views of the blue Mediterranean and sun-drenched Corsica beyond . You 'll find plenty of sun sports no matter where you stay on the Riviera . There 's yachting , fishing , motorboating , tennis , golf and horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on when you 're there and how warm you like your sea . I 've been swimming off the beach at Nice on a February day when the water was warmer than you 'll usually find it on the north shore of Massachusetts in July ? yet a gallery of startled Nicois and visitors looked at our swimming party as though we were completely insane . Average winter day 's temperature runs about sixty degrees , and if you like that temperature then the beach is for you . As you probably know , the Riviera is the home of the Bikini ? or practically nonexistent ? bathing suit , which has done more to publicize the region than Elsa Maxwell , Orson Welles , the Duke of Windsor , and the Aga Khan and his family combined . Latest report from Cannes had the girls featuring a two-piece bra and pants job made of cobwebs , and kept in place by the wearer 's holding her breath and sticking her chest out . While you 're on the Riviera you 'll want certainly to go on several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate on a number of varied itineraries . Among the most interest134 YOUR TRIP ABROAD ing arc trips through the gorges of the Var River to the Alps at Beuil and Valberg ; through the nearby hills to St. Paul , Vence , and Grasse ; on a number of different routes along the coast from Nice to Menton , where , over a distance of about seventeen miles , you have your choice of three routes : the Grande Corniche , which runs high in the mountains through the famed scenic spot , La Turbie ; the Moycnne Corniche , running through the foothills , and the Corniche du Littoral , skirting the coast . As in almost every part of France , cafe-sitting is a favorite diversion on the Riviera , where you 've got the warm , bright sun on the terraces of the cafes as an extra added attraction . Among the most popular lounging spots in Nice are the seaside cafes of the Negresco , Royal , and Ruhl hotels and the smaller cafes along the Promenade des Anglais and the restaurants and cafes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cannes counterparts are the terraces of the Carlton , Martinez , Grand , and Majestic along the Promenade de la Croisette paralleling the beach . WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK : Nice has long been known as one of the eatingest cities in France , which is one of the catingcst countries in the world . The Nicoise cuisine is a melange of Drench , Provencal , and Italian , which is to say that it 's full of garlic ? and very wonderful . One of the best places along the Riviera for local specialties is Da Bouttau , in the old part of Nice , at 2 Place Ilalles-aux-Ilcrbcs , where many of the patrons still speak Nicois , a linguistic mixture of old Provencal and Italian . Here you 'll find again the red-checked tablecloths , the wonderful cooking and the atmosphere for which French restaurants have been famous . The barker-voiced Jean Bouttau owns the place , and makes out your check by drawing pictures of what you 've had . his brother Maurice does the cooking and the rest of the family pitches in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since the grandfather of the current Bouttaus founded the restaurant in 186o . The whole place , including the kitchen , is one big room . Sausages hang from the ceiling . Try the rockfish soup , the fish in tomato sauce and olives , the fried pepper steak , or the octopus in tomato sauce . And , if you 're a drinking man of an adventurous turn of mind , you 'll want to try one shot , at least , of branda , which is practically straight alcohol distilled from grape residue left after the wine has been pressed out . It 's the eau de vie du pays which , translated literally , means " life water of the country . " Despite the name , you might not live to take your second slug , but the first will be like nothing else in the world . If you 're going to Da Bouttau for dinner be sure to get there by seven , as the place is always crowded , and you 'll have a long wait if you arrive much later . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EtatsUnis , where you can enjoy a wonderful lunch and gaze out at the sea . Nearby along the quai are Raynaud and the Maison Rouge , both celebrated restaurants . While you 're in Monte Carlo drop in for lunch at Oscar 's , I i Ave . de la Grande Bretagne , for curried chicken , lobster thermidor , and crepes suzette . Oscar is a nostalgic sort of gent who writes music and sounds // something like the late Richard Tauber used to while singing Viennese songs in French , German , Italian , and English . Best restaurants in Cannes include the Ambassadcurs , Cafe de Paris , Robert 's , Voile au Vent , Marjolaine , Le Drap d'Or , and La Jctee . HOW TO BE MERRY : Life on the Riviera , you 'll find , is divided into two parts ? day , which means sunning , sight-seeing , and sports ; and night , which amounts , primarily , to the casinos , particularly in Nice , Cannes , and Monte Carlo . Let 's take the Casino do la Mediterranee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teatime , when two orchestras play for dancing at the Candy , the Casino 's night club . Teatime begins about four-thirty and persists to seven . Then you 're expected to go back to your hotel and change ? or at least wash your hands and face ? before dinner . You go back about eight or eight-thirty and assault a beautiful meal in the main dining room . Dinner costs about three or four dollars , considerably less than it would in comparable surroundings on the outside ? the difference being made up by the profits from the gaming tables . Pushing yourself away from the table , you pat yourself on the stomach ? and waddle off into the game rooms . There you pick your poison ? roulette , boule , baccarat , or trente-quarante . Chips are worth five , twenty , one hundred , one thousand , five thousand , ten thousand , fifty thousand , and one hundred thousand francs . Gambling goes on until five and six in the morning , depending on the crowd , but if this sort of stuff does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's theater and see a comedy played by a stock company which spends Thursday to Sunday nights in Nice and the rest of the week in Monte Carlo . After the show , if you 're still bored with the business of making or losing money , you can go back to the Candy , where there 's a bottle of champagne on your table which will cost you about ten dollars . Check for a couple , tip and all , will run you about $15 , if you stick to your one bottle . Which is n't bad at all for the type of place it is ? with a good floor show that changes weekly . Admission to the Casino costs about 75 cents or $2.25 for a week 's tickets and it 's the best entertainment value in the world , if you do n't lose your shirt , pants , and vest playing something . That 's pretty much the general picture at most of the casinos on the Cote d'Azur , including the very famous one at Monte Carlo and the Municipal Casino ( winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's also a Municipal Casino at Nice , which is not considered as smart as the Mediterranee but gets more of a play from the townsfolk . Whatever casino you go to , you 're certain to meet a bemused gambler , male or female , who has a sure system for beating the roulette wheel . He ( or she ) has just perfected the system , after years of study , and now is awaiting only a deserving person , with just a bit of financial backing , with whom to get rich . The story sounds plausible ? as a matter of fact the teller is probably sincere in his telling , and believes in his system himself . But . . . do n't ! After you 've left the casinos in Nice , if you still do n't want to go to bed , // you might try Lc Poulailler , a Montmartre-type cabaret at 9 Passage Emile-Negrin , near the Avenue de la Victoire , presided over by Marcel de Barneault , a Chevalier-like character who calls himself the Official Am bassador of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Le Chat Noir in the Cours Salcya in the market place . Market people and chauffeurs eat on the ground floor , but in the basement there is a night club which opens after midnight and runs until seven or eight in the morning . Entertainment consists of a one-piece orchestra ? a drummer accompanying phonograph records ? and unescorted girls who drop in after the casinos and other night clubs all have closed . WHAT TO WEAR : Here arc the average temperature figures for the year at Cannes : From these you 'll sec that the year-round temperatures are cooler than you 'll find in southern Florida , more like southern California , or the Georgia or South Carolina coasts . So you 'll dress just about as you would for these places at home , during the comparable seasons . In midwinter you 'll want light clothing during the clay , but it can get fairly cool in the evening . That means , for men , lightweight sports outfits or tropical worsted suits for daytime wear and medium-weight versions of the same thing at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find cotton print dresses fine for the day , and wool dresses or tailored suits at night , with a light coat or wrap . Evening clothes , too , are a " must " on the Riviera . Traveling by air , you 've got a clothing problem if you 're planning to include ski clothes for a visit to the winter sports country . Be sure , if you 're crossing the ocean by air , to buy your tickets through to Nice or Marseilles . In that way you 'll be entitled to the 66-pound allotment for international passengers on the European parts of your flight , instead of only 40 pounds which is the luggage limit for continental passengers . Here 's the way I 'd solve the clothing problem within the weight allowance for men . Travel in a medium-weight plain gray flannel suit , the trousers of which can double as slacks with a sports jacket . Pack one pair of lightweight slacks and two sports jackets ? one medium , the other lightweight . Wear brown wing-tip shoes , pack a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner jacket and shoes and accessories , beach robe , two pair of swim trunks , clogs , shirts , ties , underwear , socks , handkerchiefs , and your ski outfit if you 're heading for the hills , and you 'll find you 're close to the weight limit . Do n't bother to carry suntan oil with you . It weighs , is liable to spill in your luggage ? and you can buy all you want in almost any drugstore on the Riviera . Should you find that you just ca n't make the weight limit ? and you 're not a real ski addict ? you might be willing to hire your ski boots , which you can at the mountain resorts . The true ski fan , though , will prefer to // leave something else out of his luggage , rather than try the slopes in strange boots . WHAT TO BUY : First , look back to the " What to Buy " section of the preceding chapter on Paris . You 'll find shopping in Nice , Cannes , and Monte Carlo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Paix , particularly for truly luxury articles . Nice is even better for perfume buying , since so much of it is made nearby . Your best bet for perfume is at the large department stores where all prices are standard and plainly marked . Next to the department stores in value and dependability are the perfume and lingerie shops , but know what you 're buying , and try to get the recommendation of a friend who knows the Riviera , or somebody you can depend on , like the manager of your hotel , before you go perfume shopping . Do n't ? if you want to be a canny shopper ? buy your perfume at a beauty parlor or barber shop . They sell perfume , all right , and their perfume may be perfectly good , but you 'd still be much safer buying at the perfume counter of a department store . Best single buy on the Riviera is the perfume you can get at the factories in Grasse , especially if you 're not too particular about brand names . Last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumes in aluminum flagons for three to five dollars . You 'd pay up to ten times as much for comparable perfumes in New York , but , in many cases , the perfume did not carry the most famous brand names . So if you or the person you 're buying the perfume for arc sticklers for names and fancy bottles , you might be better off with the regular brands at the department stores , despite the excellent values being offered at Grasse . WHERE TO STAY : There are , literally , thousands of places for you to stay on the French Riviera between Le Lavandou ( which , for some reason or other , I have always considered the western end of the resort area ) and Menton , a kilometer or so from the Italian frontier . They range from the most luxurious of hotels , such as the Negresco in Nice or the Carlton at Cannes where you 'll pay about $7.50 and up for a room and bath without meals , or $10 and up with meals ; and such exclusive resorts as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get in , it will cost you $15 a day for your room and $6.00 for your lunch ; down to wonderful little pensions near the sea such as La Bananeraie at Eze-Sur-Mer , midway between Nice and Monte Carlo , where you can stay for about $z6 per week including meals , and very fine meals they are , too . Not that La Bananeraie represents the cheapest accommodations on the Riviera . The Syndicat d'Iniative ( sort of a Chamber of Commerce ) of Nice has small family pensions listed with rates as low as $z.00 per day for room and meals . In between the luxury hotels and the small pensions you will find just about every sort of resort hotel , at every price range . You 'll have to go far , though , to find as good a hotel as the Negresco looking out over the Promenade des Anglais and the Bay of Angels at Nice . I do n't know whether it 's the quiet elegance of its atmosphere or its excellent dining room , or the efficiency with which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Negresco the enthusiastic recommendation of thousands of Americans , of which I am one . I 've stayed at the Negresco the last couple of times I 've been in Nice , and I certainly intend to stay there every time I come back . Nice 's other de luxe hotel , the Ruhl , also caters to a great many Americans who are just as enthusiastic about its facilities . Rates at the first-class hotels in Nice and Cannes run about $6.00 per day single , with bath , including service . My favorite among the firstclass hotels in Nice is the Royal , on the Promenade des Anglais , about midway between the Negresco and the Ruh . The location is just as good , the rooms are comparable , and all it lacks is that last touch of added swank and elegance which distinguishes the de luxe hotels . It seems to be a carefully guarded state secret , but the back part of the Negresco , facing away from the sea , has been partitioned off by the closing of hall doors , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classified as a first-class hotel , with rates considerably less than its de luxe Siamese twin . I ca n't be too sure , since I 've never stayed there , but it would seem to me that this would be a very good bet for a man or woman seeking excellent accommodations , yet keeping at least one weather eye on the budget . Other first-class hotels in Nice include the Angle-tare and Plaza . In Cannes the Carlton is my favorite among the seaside de luxe hotels , with the neighboring Martinez , Majestic , Grand , and Reserve Miramar along the Promenade de la Croisctte and the Californic in the same category . First-class Cannes hotels include the Gallia , Gonnet , and Gray . Dc luxe hotels in Monte Carlo are the Hotel de Paris , right across the street from the Casino , the Metropole , and the Hermitage . Among the first-class hotels are the Grand , Monte Carlo Palace , Mirabeau , Massena , Renaissance , and Villas Metropole . ' HOW TO TIP : See the section on tipping in the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just about the same as they are in Paris . You 'll find that your tipping wo n't be as high in smaller resorts and pensions , since you 'll be tipping 12 ? 15 per cent of smaller amounts . In addition , more services will be on the house and you 'll be expected to tip less frequently . HOW TO GET THERE : Nice is the center of air , rail , and bus services to the Riviera and along the coast . Air France runs daily flights between Paris and Nice , the four-motored Languedoc plane making the trip in 2 hours and 45 minutes . Round-trip fare is $55.8o first class . Through fares , New York to Nice , are $395 one way and $711 summer round trip and $549 for the special winter , 6o-day round-trip excursion . There is also a 15-day round-trip excursion fare , good between January 1 and March 15 , for only $462.80 .

First-class fare is $46.36 round trip , with $37 extra for your berth both ways . Second-class round-trip fare is $32.46 with the berth costRIVIERA-ALL-SEASON // ing $24.6o . The French National Railroads also operate excellent tourist busses which will take you from Paris to Nice in two days for $26.50 , round trip . Cannes is a regular port of call on the Mediterranean service of the Gydnia American Line , and the Home Line . The former runs the liner Sobieski from New York to Cannes in ten days , minimum one-way fares : first class $375 , cabin $265 , and tourist $zoo for the off-season , and $415 first , $285 cabin , and $215 tourist , during the summer season . The Home Line is running the Atlantic to Cannes in nine days from New York . Minimum one-way fares : first class $350 , cabin $290 , and tourist $245 during the " low season " and $385 first , $320 cabin , and $26o tourist during the " high season " ( May 15 ?

Pan American World Airways operates transatlantic Constellations to Marseilles from New York , via Lisbon and Barcelona . It makes the flight in nineteen hours and forty-five minutes and the round-trip fare is $705.60 . Marseilles is also on the itineraries of the American Export Line 's famous " Four Aces " ships ( 11 days from New York , one-way minimum $320 ) . From Marseilles you can take the train to Nice which makes it in three and one half hours ( round trip , first class $8.6z ) or go by bus in eleven hours ( round trip $4.82 ) . The bus trip , though considerably longer , is the best way to see the countryside , which is particularly interest-ing along the coastal routes between Toulon and Nice .

Rebirth of the Land of Renaissance TODAY Italy ranks high among the countries most Americans want to visit on their vacations abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the greatest tourist year in Italian history . More than three million foreign visitors ? half a million above the 1949 figure ? will visit Rome and participate in the jubilee . One in every ten of the Holy Year visitors ? three hundred thousand ? will be Americans , most of whom will come as individuals or in small unofficial groups and will usually stop at the better hotels . The great majority of European pilgrims , on the other hand , will arrive in large organized groups and , for the most part , will stay at less expensive lodgings provided by the Vatican . The year 1951 will almost certainly also be a phenomenal one for Italy , if for no other reason than because many thousands of non-Catholic travelers who want to visit Italy will postpone their trip rather than buck Holy Year crowds . One thing you can be sure of ? during the next few years the influx of tourists will tax Italian hotel and transportation accommodations particularly in the vicinity of Rome . Be sure to book your travel space and make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your departure for Europe as you possibly can .

It 's a story that had its beginning early in June 1945 when Allied soldiers up from the beaches around Anzio and down from the mountains around Cassino met in the outskirts of Rome to find themselves welcomed as liberators by the clean , comely , and sophisticated citizens of one of the great capitals of world culture ? a city comparatively untouched , physically , by the war . Here was a startling contrast to the battered towns and villages of southern Italy which to the eyes of American soldiers was truly miraculous . When Italian partisans of the north fought magnificently against the Germans and their own Fascist forces the reputation of Italians as fighters for liberty shone as it had n't since the days of Garibaldi and Cavour . The signs of a new renaissance began to appear quickly after the war . A few great Italian films such as Open City , Shoeshine , and Paisan made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Italy during and just after the war , and the government of the new Italian Republic made it plain that Italy intended to cast its lot with the West in its future development . Meanwhile , the first postwar visitors to Italy thrust tentative toes into the Italian boot and were amazed to find it extremely comfortable for // them . Instead of the misery , squalor , and hunger that newspaper correspondents had reported in Italy , they found wonderfully lavish meals and splendid service at very low prices in hotels and restaurants which speedily were restoring their fittings and appointments to their prewar luxury . Reading the letters they wrote back home describing lavish meals and bargain-basement opulence , friends of the early tourists did n't know what to think . Should they go to Italy on their vacations abroad , or should n't they ? Was Italy a devastated land of tattered and hungry people or a tourist paradise of good living ? Which story was correct ? The answer is , of course , that they both arc . It 's just a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dollar-bearing American tourist is an opulent and sunny place where ? despite the fact that prices have gone up noticeably ? luxury is still obtainable at a discount . The Italian Italy , on the other hand ? the Italy , especially , of the industrial workers , the lower middle class , civil servants and lesser government employees ? continues to be a country of struggle and poverty and often hunger , as it has been almost always . One of the first things you ought to get straight in your mind when you think about vacationing in Italy is that you arc not taking any food out of the mouths of Italians in want when you down a spectacular dinner in one of the hundreds of fine restaurants open today . The meal you eat would n't go to hungry Italians if you did n't cat it , for obviously they could n't afford to buy on that level . Your trip to Italy will help the Italians . By buying things there with your dollars ? things such as hotel rooms and transportation as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars it has to have to buy machinery and raw materials . These help their economy by giving people jobs so they 'll have money to buy the food they lack . And that applies not only to Italy , but it 's the basis of the drive of all the Marshall Plan countries for American tourists . This does not mean you 'll have to reconcile yourself to eating while mothers with starving babes scratch their emaciated hands against the window pane . All that was eliminated two or three years ago with Italy 's first postwar recovery , and today the average visitor to Rome sees no more poverty and suffering than does the average foreign visitor to New York witness what goes on in the slums of Harlem three miles from Radio City . The Italy you 'll see as an American vacationist will be completely attractive . The cities you will visit ? particularly Rome , Venice , Florence , Genoa , and Milan ? will be busy , lively , quite clean and very gay . The hotels will be excellent , with good appointments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll find that most of the Italians you meet will be . . . well , charming is probably the most descriptive word . They 're friendly , hospitable , helpful , and seem genuinely glad to see you there . You 'll enjoy being with them . WHAT TO DO AND WHAT TO SEE : As the world 's most historic city , Rome has had its shares of cliches written about it ? " When in Rome do as the Romans .... Rome was n't built in a day . . . . All roads lead to Rome , " etc . You 've been hearing about Rome and reading about it // since your grade-school history class , and when you do find yourself in Rome ? after all these years ? you 'll want to get out into the streets as quickly as possible and put your footsteps into the paths of the Caesars . Like Paris , Rome is best seen and savored by people who know how to walk . Take one of the sight-seeing tours that leave by bus and cars from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast orientation on the town then put on your most comfortable pair of walking shoes and start making the streets of Rome your own . Since I 've stayed at the Hotel Excelsior the last couple of times I 've been in Rome , I generally fortify myself with a morning coffee on the terrace of Doney 's , next to the hotel , and watch the world pass by on the Via Vittorio Veneto . If ambition finally comes to me I detach myself from the cafe table and chair and walk up the Via Veneto a few hundred yards to the Umberto Gardens ( which used to be called the Borghese Gardens ) and steep myself in ancient Rome by looking over parts of the ancient wall at the Porta Pinciana . If the morning is sunny you 'll probably want to take a stroll in the gardens and watch the horseback riders at the Galoppatoio . From there you can walk down the Via di Porta Pincina to the lovely old church of the Holy Trinity of the Hills and descend the famous old white stone Spanish steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps in the world ? to the Piazza di Spagna and into the Via Condotti , one of the finest shopping streets in the city . Here the famous old Caffe Greco is a good place to stop for another cup of coffee or for a light lunch , if you 're starting to take it easy on eating ( which , should you be at all allergic to calories , you 'll probably do after a few days of Roman dining ) . From the Via Condotti you head straight for the Tiber , along the Via Tomacelli and cross the river on the Ponte Cavour . A short walk along the river side , past the Palace of Justice , and you 're at the turreted Castel Sant ' - Angelo , once the tomb of the Emperor Hadrian , a private fortress of the popes during the middle ages and one of Rome 's many tourist " musts . " It was here that pilgrims saw a vision of St. Michael the Archangel sheathing his sword as a sign of the ending of a great plague in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " Angel 's Castle " and a statue of St. Michael commemorates the event . Inside the building is a display of the arsenal of medieval warfare , including stone cannon balls , catapults , crossbows , primitive artillery , and devices for pouring boiling oil down on unfriendly visitors and dungeons for cooling off those who survived . Coming out of the Castel Sant'Angelo you 'll see on your right one of the great sights of Christendom , St. Peter 's and Vatican City dominating the heights at the end of the broad Via della Conciliazione . Once you enter the great Piazza of St. Peter 's , where three hundred thousand pilgrims have stood to receive the Pope 's benediction , you are in the confines of Vatican City , the world 's smallest independent state , one-sixth of a square mile in area . In the center of the Piazza is a huge obelisk brought from Egypt on a huge raft and erected in its present position in 1586 to honor St. Peter . The bronze cross at the top contains a piece of the Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks on great occasions is in the center of the front of the church , overlooking the Piazza . Inside St. Peter 's itself , you 're struck immediately by its enormous size . It 's the world 's largest church , designed by an architect who wanted to convey some idea of the immensity of God by the vastness of the cathedral . Under a great canopy at the upper end of the church , under the forty story-high dome , is the tomb of St. Peter , visited by millions of pilgrims down through the ages . Around the base of the dome , in golden letters six feet high , are the words Jesus Christ spoke to St. Peter : " Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it . " In the Sistine Chapel are Michelangelo 's famous painting of the Creation , the fall of man , the deluge , and the Last judgment ; and murals by Perugino and Botticelli . Some of the finest paintings by Raphael also are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest art and archaeo logical collections and libraries . The Sistine Chapel and some of the Vatican 's finest paintings and statuary may be seen by the public , ordinar ily , every day from q A.M. until 12:30 P.M. , though special arrangements may be necessary to take care of IIoly Year pilgrims . Frequent audiences will be granted by Pope Pius XII throughout the Holy Year . Arrangements for audiences arc made through the American Presidential Mission to His Iloliness , at Via Boncompagni z ; the Church of Santa Susanna for American Catholics , Via Vcnti Scttcmbrc 15 ; or the American Catholic Club , Via dclla Conciliazione 3 . If you are a Catholic you should be ready to present a letter of introduction from an American Catholic pastor . Women arc required to wear a dark suit or long-sleeved dress , stockings , and a hat or veil covering their head at audiences . A black dress and black hat is the preferred attire . Men arc expected to wear dark suits . Catholics genuflect and kiss the Pope 's ring ; this is not required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes me down to the end of the Via Vittorio Veneto , into the Piazza Barberini , along the Via Quattro Fontane and then into the Via del Quirinale . You 'll pass the Quirinal Palace which was the official residence of the Italian royal family before the abdication of Umberto in 1946 . A few blocks away is the Corso Umberto , one of Rome 's main business streets , named after a more dis tinguished Umberto . Nearby is the colossal ( and I use the word carefully ) white and gold monument to Victor Emanuel II , also named after a greater king than the one who bore the name recently . At the base of the monument is the tomb of Italy 's Unknown Soldier of the first war . Facing the huge monument , you 've almost overlooked a little balcony on the right side of the Piazza Venezia . If you 've got a good memory for newsreels you 'll remember that it was from this balcony that a small man with large ideas ? a fellow by the name of Mussolini ? made faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Italian common sense , and yelled for Nice , Tunis , Corsica , Paris , and whatever else happened to arouse his cupidity at the moment . Walk around to the back of the Victor Emanuel monument and you 're in the heart of ancient Rome . Here you 'll want to spend at least a morning // or long afternoon poking around in the paths of the Caesars . ( If you 're taking pictures I 'd recommend the afternoon , as I found the light better then for color . ) In this neighborhood you 'll find the ruins of the Roman Forum , meeting place of the people of the Roman Empire . Here were temples , law courts , shops , palaces , and triumphal columns and arches . Within a half hour you 'll start imagining you 're seeing characters walking around in white togas and hearing the pounding of horses ' hoofs and the rumbling of chariot wheels . Here , too , are the House of the Vestal Virgins , the Palatine IIill where Romulus and his followers erected the first primitive homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maximus where a quarter of a million spectators watched chariot races , the Roman capitol where Julius Caesar arrived between lines of elephants holding lighted torches in their trunks , and the Colosseum where fifty thousand people watched gladiators fight to the death or saw Christian martyrs thrown to the lions . Rome is more than twenty-seven hundred years old , and almost every one of these years has left something of interest to be seen in the city , Practically all of the Italian capital is one great museum , and you could . spend months of sight-seeing without exhausting the city 's interest for you . That 's why it 's so difficult to try to outline what to see in Rome , However , even if you only have a few days in which to see Rome , you should n't leave without seeing ( in addition to the above ) : The other three great basilicas . ( St. Peter 's , of course , is the first . ) These are St. Paul 's Outside the Walls ; St. John Lateran , with its altar enclosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Major , fifteen hundred years old , the largest church honoring the Blessed Virgin and one of the most beautiful of Rome 's hundreds of churches . ( Basilicas are churches particularly distinguished by their age and ecclesiastical tradition . ) The Pantheon ? best preserved of all the Imperial Roman buildings in the city . Built in 27 s.c . as a pagan temple , it was consecrated later as a Christian church . Raphael is buried here , together with Victor Emanuel II and his son Umberto I. The statue of Moses by Michelangelo , in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli on the Via Cavour ? one of the most dramatic and powerful figures ever carved in marble . Finishing his masterpiece , Michelangelo is said to have stood before it and struck it with his mallet , demanding " Speak ! " The mark of the mallet blow is still to be seen on the knee of the statue . The Old Appian Way ? the ancient road to Rome from the south , bordered with cypresses and dotted with ruined tombs and towers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the original Roman pavement is still intact . Using your imagination a bit , when traffic is quiet for the moment , you can very easily picture yourself watching the legions that pounded over that road in New Testament days . Here , too , is the entrance to some of the Catacombs , the long , underground galleries where early Christians hid from their Roman persecutors to hear Mass , receive the Sacraments , and bury their dead . // The Appian Way will lead you to historical sights of more recent vintage ? Cassino , ancient monastery town blasted to rubble in one of the most bitterly fought battles of the recent war in Europe ; and Anzio , the bloody beach , site of one of the largest American military cemeteries . In the outer edges of the town , in the opposite direction , you 'll see a self-erected monument to the man responsible in a large measure for the misery of Anzio and Cassino , the Mussolini Forum ( now called the Italian Forum ) which Il Duce planned as a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been exploited as a celebration of the new Roman Empire . The games were never held , the park was never completed , and the neo-modern structures were used temporarily as lodgings for Holy Year pilgrims . In your sight-seeing , cafe-sitting , and theater and opera-going you 'll find yourself conditioned by the peculiar working schedule of the Romans . Government offices , for example , open at nine in the morning and stay open until two . They 're closed for lunch then until four or five in the afternoon , then they open up and do n't shut down for the day until nine or ten in the evening . That means late-starting theaters and movies , later night clubs and a big gap in the middle of the clay for a heavy meal and a light snooze . And , as far as you 're concerned , while in Rome . .. I almost said it ! The opera starts at nine , and you 'll want to go at least once while you 're in Rome , even if you do n't know " la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its dressiest and most elegant . Wear evening clothes , unless you want to feel like a game warden . The show between the acts is almost as good as the one on stage . The realistic Romans , realizing that people go to the opera to see people and be seen , have organized things to eliminate the lobby crush that fouls up New York theater openings . In the central hall you get into line and move around in a counter-clockwise direction , like the Penn Relays . That gives you a chance to look over the famous Roman blondes or their gowns ( depending on whether you 're man or woman ) and you 'll also get an eye-filling display of uniforms and military decorations . Many Americans who visit England and France often do n't see much more than London or Paris . Even though Rome is every bit as much of a world capital , visitors to Italy generally want to see some of the other cities and tourist centers before they leave the country . In the rosy-edged dream world of the American escapist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hawaii , the Riviera and the South Sea islands as a place a man would want to go to , if only he could go someplace . Its famed tourist attractions long ago became the stereotypes of the travelogue and the steamship folder ? the white marble palaces along the Grande Canal , the Basilica with the gold of its mosaics resplendent in the sun and fabulous in the moonlight , the silver sands of the Lido across the Laguna , and the gondolas ? above all the gondolas , with their singing gondoliers , and maybe a dark-eyed signorina looking up at you through the moonlight . // The gondolier is one of the most colorful characters you 'll meet in Europe . He is to Venice just about what a free-wheeling cabdriver is to New York . Like his American counterpart , the gondolier makes his main stand around the railroad station , bus terminal , and principal hotels . His rates are fixed by municipal edict , and they 're based on the hour or fraction thereof . For five dollars he 'll take two persons out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide thrown into the bargain . You 'll see all the waterside sights of the town , including the Bridge of Sighs and the prison from which Casanova made his dramatic escape across the rooftops after his amatory prowess had carried him all the way from the powder room to the pokey . Usual tip for all this is fifty lire , or less than ten cents , per person , and the tip of a pack of American cigarettes will make you the most popular gondola passenger in all Venice . That , too , should just about assure you of your gondolier 's breaking out into aNeapolitan love song ? always assuming that he approves of the looks and general contours of the women in the party . Like all Latins , the Venetian has a strongly developed appreciation of the beauty of woman and the spell of moonlight on water , with appropriate musical background . Your gondolier will sing for the same reasons and at the same times as your New York cabdriver will discuss politics or the state of the Dodgers ? if he feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fare . Hoene may very well be where the heart is ? in which case Venice is the second home of every discerning visitor who ever floated down the Grande Canal and watched the colored lanterns offshore at midnight . Capri ranks with Venice as one of the truly romantic and glamorous resorts of Europe . Ask a southern Italian about Capri and something will happen to him . Into his brown eyes will come the look of a man thinking of the first woman he loved , and his voice will grow soft as he whispers , " Ah , the bellezza What loveliness 1 " As for a beautiful woman , men have fought and died for Capri since the dark days before the dawn of history . After prehistoric man the Phoenicians were the first to win the lovely island , then try to hold it against the assaults of those who would take it for themselves . The ancient Greeks came next , followed by the Romans , Neapolitans , Saracens , French , Austrians , Spaniards , the French again , the British , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kingdom of Italy . Maybe it is because he knows he has had this beauty for only a moment in history that the Italian loves Capri so deeply . Whatever the reason , Capri is the one place in Europe where the American visitor in midsummer will find himself outnumbered by natives who are themselves tourists . Come July and August , and Italians fill to the rails the small steamers which make the crossing from Naples and Sorrento , itself one of the most beautiful resorts in the world . Together with the Americans , British , French , and other foreigners , they jam the streets and crowd the hotels , and the island loses its wonderful sense of solitude . Go to Capri in midsummer if you must , but it will mean more to you if you can time your visit for any other season of the year . The weather // is almost always fine , and you can walk along the cliffs alone or with somebody with whom you want to share this loveliness , passing above the famed grotto , looking over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing over the rocks from which the sirens once sang the sailors of Ulysses to their doom . In the peace and quiet of another age you will ride a horse-drawn carriage to the heights of Anacapri , where Augustus Caesar built his refuge from the Roman court . You 'll spend an unhurried hour sipping a glass of Capri wine in front of one of the cafes which line the village square in front of the old campanile . You will board a little red car of the funicular railway that takes you down through the orange groves to the port , the Grande Marina , where fishermen are working on their boats , drying their nets , paying not the slightest attention to you or your fellow-visitors during the off-season . You will see them unloading their catches , and the smell of the cooking of freshly caught fish will come from a score of waterside restaurants . You 'll be able to stand only a little of this before your will power bends and you go into one of the restaurants , perhaps for sole alla palombara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , though , you will not really know Capri until you have sailed into the Blue Grotto in one of the little boats that picks up visitors at the Grande Marina . You can do it by a motorboat , but the quiet magic of the place will come through better if you hire a rowboat with a boatman who loves the magic of the grotto too much to spoil it by any stream of sight-seeing chatter . When your fingertips have touched the smooth surface of that vast luminous crystal of the grotto 's wall then you can say that you 've received the baptism of Capri . After that you 'll want nothing better than to go over to the beach at the Piccola Marina , on the other side of the island , lie in the sun , and thank the happy fate that made you heir to the glory that once belonged to the Caesars . You 'll want to include Florence , too , on your itinerary . It 's practically one huge art gallery , the world 's greatest repository of Renaissance painting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town with some of the ugliest slums and one of the most beautiful views in the world . Nearby are Vesuvius and the cities it ruined ? Pompeii and Herculaneum . In Sicily , Taormina is one of the finest winter resorts still comparatively undiscovered by American visitors , where you can ski down the snowy slopes of Mt . Etna , then take a short drive and swim in the sun-warmed Mediterranean nearby . The playground of German princes before the first war , displaced Balkan royalty and fascist bigshots and their Nazi playmates between wars , Taormina is today a combination of Capri and the Riviera , where luxury at bargain rates is going begging only until enough Americans discover what 's awaiting them there . ,  --  , 3 WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK : Rome has almost as many fine restaurants as Paris , and it 's just about as hard to try to say which of the many are the best . There are good eating places to suit almost every taste and every vacation budget , from the lavish spots where the food , wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll find anywhere in // the world to little trottoria where the surroundings , service , and the size of the check you 'll get are all unpretentious , but the food and wine are still something special . Probably the most famous restaurant in Rome is Alfrcdo 's , noted among generations of American visitors for its Roman and other regional specialties , as well as international dishes . In addition to Americans , its clientele includes many Roman artists and politicians . Other celebrated restaurants include Fagiano , Pozzetto , San Carlo , Basilica , Ulpia , Osteria dell'Orso , Ranieri 's , and Roma . Every visitor to Rome compiles his own personal list of best bets . Yours will probably be different from mine or any others . Rome , though , is one of those cities where you do n't have to eat according to any list . You can wander around the streets and discover a dozen good little restaurants unknown to all the world except you , the owner , and the people of the neighborhood who have been eating there for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wandered into a little place called Da Gennaro , at Via del Lavatore 26 , in a poor section of town , and for less than $2.50 , including tip , I got excellent antipasto , pork chops and mushrooms in a butter sauce , a bottle of very good Chianti , chocolate cake , a basket of fruit , coffee , and entertainment by a violinist , a tenor who sang " Cielo Linde " like Tino Rossi , and a girl dressed in a blue tailored suit and brown-and-white saddle shoes who sang a Neapolitan love song about a signorina who was going to throw herself from Vesuvius into the sea ? a jump of better than five miles ? because her man , he do n't love her . One of the best small restaurants I found in Rome was the Pizzeria St. Ignazio , on the Piazza St. Ignazio . A sort of modest Italian Lindy 's , it 's a favorite late spot for newspaper and theatrical people , who come in after the show for spaghetti or pizza and a bottle of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seems to burgeon best in small restaurants late at night . Sooner or later , though , despite the fine Italian cooking you 'll find all over Rome , you 'll pine for a respite from the rich dishes and long for a chance to relax and talk English again , if only for one lunch hour . When you do , his you to the Shanghai Restaurant , at Via Borgogna zg . It 's a good old American chop suey joint , run by Nick Plati and Sam Mole , two ex-GIs who married Italian girls and settled down in Rome after practically kidnapping a Chinese cook in Paris to act as their chef . If you want to write anything from a letter to a novel in Rome sit yourself down at the famous old Caffe Greco , on the Via Condotti . Since its founding in 176o , it 's been the meeting place of such literary and musical figures as Byron , Keats , Shelley , Gocthe , Mark Twain , Gounod , Bizet , Wagner , D'Annunzio , Anatole France , Schopenhauer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius has been to give everybody connected with the place a decent respect for the privacy of man 's meditation . So you can sit there quietly all day with one cup of coffee , if you choose , with nobody bothering you . It 's a wonderful place to collapse on a chair , empty out your pockets or pocketbook , sort out all the impressions that have been bouncing madly around in your head ever since you got to Rome , write the post cards you promised to everybody at home , and rest // and relax generally from the rigors of life as a short-term American visitor to the cradle of modern civilization . Speaking of relaxation , teatime and cocktail time are when everybody who is n't working relaxes in Rome . Teatime extends from five to seven , when it runs into the cocktail hour , which lasts until nine ? when people start drifting off to dinner . That gives you four hours for recuperating from the strenuous business of touring the town , going back to your hotel and changing for dinner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearooms along the Via Veneto which on sunny days put their tables out along the sidewalk arc favorites for tea and cocktails . These include the aforementioned Doncy at the Excelsior , Rosati , Rupe Tarpea , and Galvani , all nearby along the Via Veneto . After a couple of the Martinis for which Rome is famous you will be in excellent shape for wandering into practically any likely looking restaurant in Rome for a memorable dinner . Or , if you do n't feel like exercising your initiative , you can go into any of the best hotels and be assured of a good dinner , even though it might cost you a bit more than in one of your private discoveries . It wo n't be too steep , however . The Excelsior is just about the most expensive hotel in Rome , and its dinners begin at around two dollars for the prix fixe job . Do n't forget that it 's considered perfectly correct in Italy to add restaurant and other bills fairly carefully . Every-body does it , so there 's no reason why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good indication of Rome 's weather throughout the year : Naples , southern Italy , and Sicily arc considerably warmer than Rome ; Venice , Florence , Milan , and the cities of the north are a lot colder ; the Italian Riviera from Ventimille to La Spezia , including San Remo , Genoa , Portofino and Rapallo , enjoy Mediterranean climates which make them all-season resorts . The weakness of general rules are their exceptions . Nevertheless the fol lowing are good for general reference : Near lightweight clothing ( men : tropical worsted suits , light sports jackets and slacks ; women : cotton , silk , nylon , or rayon dresses ) in Sicily // all-year round ; in Naples , Rome and the Riviera during late spring , summer , and early fall ; in northern cities throughout the summer . Wear medium-weight clothing ( men : business suits , sports jacket and slacks combinations , topcoats or combination topcoats and raincoats ; women : suits , jackets and skirts , woolen dresses , topcoats ) in Naples and Rome , October ? April ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall . Wear heavy clothing ( medium-weight suits or sports combinations , pull-overs , heavy coats or topcoats with heavy removable linings ) in Naples and Rome and points north , with the exception of the Riviera , in winter . Rome is dressy , so you 'll want to take evening clothes , if you can possibly get them into your luggage . Casual clothes are right for daytime wear . You 'll spend so much time in Rome sight-seeing that you 'll want to wear the most comfortable clothes possible ? good sturdy shoes that will insulate your feet from the beatings of pavement and cobblestones , sports clothes that will stand up under hard wear without looking as though you 'd been sleeping in them , which means dark colors , usually . Men will change into business suits in Rome for nights when they 're not wearing black tic ; and it 's dinner dresses most evenings for women . . WHAT TO BUY : Silks are the best buy for American visitors , silks in any and all forms : silk ties , scarves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nightgowns . Leathergoods are second on the list : gloves , wallets , purses , handbags , cigarette cases , picture frames , and jewelry boxes . If you 're planning to be in Rome for any length of time you 'll probably want to order some custom-made blouses or shirts . The Italians arc among the few shirtmakers in the world who know what to do with collars in accordance with American tastes , and I saw sonic beautiful shirtings which would be cut to your measure and specifications for five or six dollars . Borsalino hats have been famous for generations ; their quality is excellent , and they 're good buys if you 're the sort of man who can wear a " foreignlooking " hat with dash and aplomb . You 're expected to bargain in Italy , and the price on merchandise is the asking price ? not the selling price ? in all except the largest department stores and the most expensive gift shops ( and even then you can sometimes save yourself some money by hesitating before you buy , and asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of quantity ) . Technique in bargaining is to offer considerably less than you 're willing to pay for an article ? say roughly about half the asking-price ? and work your way up slowly to a point between two-thirds and three-quarters of the asking price . Once or twice in the proceedings indicate that you 're fed up with the whole business and about to walk out without making the purchase . If you 're a reasonably good actor and the price is about what he had expected to get , the shopkeeper or salesman might close the deal then and there . If you 're interested in any one particular item in the store never leap upon it with gleaming eyes and ask the price . That will send the asking price right up . Browse around the shop awhile first . // instead , and ask the price of a couple of other articles before you offhandedly pick up the thing you 're actually interested in . Whatever you do , do n't be unpleasant about the bargaining process . It 's all in the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , clean fun ? and if you ever paid the shopkeeper his asking price without at least a friendly argument , or attempt to beat him down , he 'd feel frustrated and bitterly disappointed because he had n't named a higher figure in the first place . He 'd be much happier if you paid him less but made him play you for every lira , like a salmon on a six-pound test line . While we 're in the department of practical hints let 's have a few words on the germane subject of changing your money . Italy is probably the one place in the world where I would unqualifiedly recommend that you change your money on the free ( sometimes called black ) market . This practice is so universally accepted in Italy that you might have some inconvenience in trying to find a place to change money at the legal rate . Everywhere you go ? at your hotel , in restaurants , shops , in the little foreign exchange booths and stores of the main streets ? your money will be changed at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollar . Best thing to do is to ask your hotel porter what the going rate is on the dollar , and then sec how much better you can do with the men who congregate outside of hotels and other places catering to Americans . They 're there to do business in foreign exchange and cigarettes . Bargain with them , and you might find that you get somewhat more for your dollars . Frequently , though , your hotel porter or a shopkeeper will give you an exchange rate so good that it 's not worth your while to dicker with the street-corner Ponzis . Whatever you do , do n't change your money when you arrive at the Ciampino airport . There you 'll get the official rate , less what some character thinks he can deduct as a service charge . Here , again , is an example of the advantage of getting some currency of the country you 're about to go to before you enter the country , to take care of tips , transportation to your hotel , etc. , until you can survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the best rate you can get , rather than seek someone who changes money at the ephemeral official rate , because : I. The realistic Italians base their economy and their prices at the true ( e.g. free or black ) market value of their lire . 2 . Italian officials make little or no effort to enforce their currency restrictions . The exchange regulations exist on the books , like the regulations some towns in New England have against kissing your wife on Sunday , and that 's about all . If you 're so law-abiding that you do n't pull the tag off a pillow because it 's illegal to do so then change your money at the official rate , if not you are only cheating yourself . Since the general devaluation of European currencies in the fall of 1949 , the differential between official and free rates has become considerably less important than before . Check the situation , though , when you get there . c4 WHERE TO STAY : Last time I was in Rome 1 stopped at the Excelsior , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bly the best-known hotel in Rome among Americans . It 's luxurious , clean , and well-managed , the service is good , the food excellent ? and it 's one of the centers of life for Rome 's American colony . The lobby and public rooms are always a-bustle with people , and you 'll usually find a film celebrity or two exercising their egos , or flexing their libidos around the bar or in the little night club downstairs . The Excelsior is probably the most expensive hotel in town , but it 's still considerably cheaper than most comparable hotels elsewhere , with single rooms with bath renting at about $6.0o including heat , which is usually charged as an extra on the bill during months when heat is necessary . Other de luxe hotels in Rome with rates in about the same range are the Palazzo e Ambasciatori ( Ambassador to you ) , Grand , Hasslcr-Villa Mcdici ( a favorite with honeymooners ) , Bernini Bristol , and Mediterranco . First-class hotels in Rome charge about $4.0o a day for single rooms with bath . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ville , Eden , Elisco , Flora , Majestic , Marini , Massimo D'Azeglio , Milano , Minerva , Moderno , Nazionale , Plaza , Quirinale , Regina Carlton , San Giorgio , and Savoia . To avoid confusion when you get your bill , it 's advisable to pay for all extra items such as laundry , valet service , mineral water , meals in rooms ( if you 're not on an American plan rate ) , etc. , as you get each item . In that way there should be nothing on your hotel bill except room , heating , phone calls , taxes , and service , and there wo n't be any question of whether you had four bottles of mineral water or seven . The Holy Year rush is expected to tax the hotel accommodations not only of Rome , but of most other tourist centers in Italy , so be sure to make reservations well in advance , preferably before you leave the States , if you 're planning a visit during Holy Year . WHAT TO TIP : Rome hotels add 18 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cities the service charge is 15 per cent . Restaurants generally add 15 per cent as a service charge . But that certainly does n't take care of the tipping ; all it does is complicate the situation . ( This is partly the fault of American visitors , who could n't get out of the tipping habit , even though they were paying for service on their bills . ) For tipping purposes you can figure the lira to be worth about 60o to the dollar . Thus 300 lire is equivalent to about a half dollar , 150 lire to a quarter , 50 lire something under a dime . Here 's a tipping scale given to me in all seriousness by an official of the Italian National Tourist Office in Rome . Ile said it 's based on the fact that the service charge is supposed to take care of tips for normal service , and stated that it 's a fair representation of what Italians tip in the best hotels and around town : Bellhops and porters , 50 to loo lire per bag they lug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering telegrams , mineral water , etc. , zo lire . Hall porter for getting railroad or theater tickets , loo lire . Chambermaid , 50 lire per day . // Waiters , 5 ? 10 per cent of check if service charge is added , 15 per cent if it is n't . Cab drivers 20 to 30 lire , depending on distance . Cab fares , by the way , are paid by multiplying by one hundred the amount on the meter ( which is the prewar rate ) . Thus if your meter reads 1.75 lire , you pay 175 ; 3.25 on the meter , pay 3z5 lire , and so on . Station porters 50 to loo lire per bag for taking your bags from the cab to the train , another 50 or loo for putting them on the train in your compartment . Well , the above tipping scale might be all right for Italians , but it 's my own opinion that any American who tried it would stand a good chance of being lynched , or at least having the sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the above amounts , to stay on the safe side . After all , life for most Italians these days is far from easy , so why be a cheap skate , when for so little more , in American money , you can be a lady or gentle-man ? Be sure to tip the hall porter per service performed for you . They 're little Caesars , and can make life extremely difficult for you . I once made the mistake of failing to do this at the Excelsior , intending to tip the hall porters when I left . They speedily became thoroughly unpleasant ? their attitude the more obvious because it contrasted so strikingly with the usual attitude of friendly courtesy on the part of most Italians which is one of the happiest things about a visit to Italy . Whatever you do , do n't forget to tip the chambermaids . They work harder , get paid less , and collect fewer tips than almost any other members of the hotel staff . , J I-IOW TO GET THERE : Two airlines fly direct to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both have comparable services , schedules , and equipment ( Constellations ) . Round-trip fares are $747 from New York , with a 6o-day off-season round-trip excursion fare between October 1 and April 30 of $597.6o . If you have only two weeks in winter , there is the 15-day excursion trip for $485.40 . Last time I was in Rome I flew direct from New York on Air France 's Rome Comet . It was a perfect flight , leaving Idlewild Field , New York , at 10 A.m . Tuesday and setting down at Ciampino , Rome , at 1:45 P.M. Wednesday , but since there 's a sixhour time difference between New York and Rome , the flight took less than twenty-two hours . You can also make it on a somewhat longer schedule on Pan American 's transatlantic Constellation service connecting with Constellations of their affiliate , Panair do Brazil , at Lisbon . All the transatlantic airlines run flights connecting Rome with their European terminals : Air France from Paris , British European Airways ( connecting with British Overseas ) from London , KLM from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copenhagen , and Swissair from Zurich and Geneva .

The Khedivial Mail Lines , an Egyptian company , runs two ships , the Khedive Ismail and Mahomed Ali Kebir between New York and Naples and Genoa with minimum rates of $290 for the one-class ships . Cargo ships of i2-passenger capacity are run between American and Italian ports by the Barber Steamship Lines , Concordia Lines , Costa Line , Fabre Line , Lykes Bros . Steamship Lines , Staubo Line , Stevenson Line , Torm Line , and Waterman Steamship Corporation with minimum rates ranging between $zio and $300 . There are excellent rail connections between most of the principal cities of western Europe and Italy , and Holy Year fare reductions are being made by French and Swiss railways and the Italian railways , but I ca n't recommend train travel within Italy too enthusiastically . The Italian railroads took a terrific pounding during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First-class railroad compartment space is sometimes unobtainable , second- and third-class frequently overcrowded . Sleeper accommodations should be booked at least four days in advance . Even if you have your place reserved , taking an Italian train is usually a nerve-racking experience because of the crowds and the ever present chance that you 'll have an argument over your seat , simply because some156 YOUR TRIP ABROAD one got tired of standing , or perhaps because the same seat reservation was sold to two different people . Much more satisfactory is the service of LAI , the Italian airline which runs DC-3 service between Rome and the principal cities of Italy , or the tourist bus service of CIAT . The latter represents the last word in bus travel , with bars , stewardesses , washrooms , and radios aboard . It 's the best way to tour Italy ? next to driving your own car or hiring one . Chauffeur-driven Italian cars may be hired for $20425 per day , or you can rent a car and drive it yourself . RED TAPE : Moderate .

Leaving the country , there are no restrictions on tobacco , liquor , or food , and you 're allowed to talc ro , 000 lire and no greater amount of foreign currency than you brought in with you . Which is reasonable enough . One rather stupid bit of red tape remains , however , despite efforts of Italian tourist officials to have it abolished . That is the foglio di soggiorno , a tourist identification documcut issued you by the police and which you 're supposed to keep with you during your visit and surrender at the frontier when you leave the country . You get the darned thing by presenting your-self at the police station within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of your hotel can get it for you . I did n't know anything about it , the last time I was in Italy , and nobody at the hotel said anything about it , so I did n't wake up to the fact that I would need this valuable document to get out of the country until it was too late to do anything about it except worry , which I did . When I left Italy , though , nobody asked me for my foglio di soggiorno . In fact the immigration officials did n't seem to know about it either . That 's why I call it stupid . FOR MORE INFORMATION : The Italian National Tourist Office , 630 Fifth Avenue , is the place to get in touch with for more information on Italy , or for further help in arranging your trip .

European Showpiece SWITZERLAND is the favorite European country of many Americans going abroad for the first time . Always one of Europe 's most popular resort areas , Switzerland has not had the devastation of two world wars to recover from , which is one reason why her house is always in such good order . Another is the fact that the outstanding characteristic of the Swiss people , amounting almost to a national genius , is the ability to get things done . This popular passion for hard work , plus potential water power and magnificent scenery , represents just about the total national resources grudgingly granted to Switzerland by nature . It is the combination of these three factors that has made Switzerland a truly great tourist country . The scenery was there to be looked at , the water power created the elec tricity which kept the place clean and made possible the great national railway system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and made it work , so that visitors from all over the world could come to Switzerland , relax and enjoy life , while their hosts took over the details . With the tourist trade one of their country 's major industries , the Swiss have organized it as carefully as they assemble a watch . The American visitor senses this almost as soon as he enters the country . Customs and immigration formalities arc kept at a minimum , and they arc carried through quickly and courteously . Once in Switzerland , it speedily dawns on you that the country is just one big resort , or so it will seem if Swiss people interested in the tourist business ? and that appears to be almost everybody ? have their way . Switzerland has more hotel rooms per capita than any other country in the world ; there are 28,000 keepers of hotels , restaurants , and inns ; zoo , 000 beds for tourists ; and I aoo mountain guides . Practically every other Swiss between the ages of sixteen and forty is a ski instructor , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , probably , does the visitor stand less of a chance of being clipped . The Swiss cabdriver , porter , restaurateur or hotel pro prietor is used to dealing with foreigners , and he expects to be doing busi ness with them for the rest of his life , so he feels no overpowering urge to soak the sucker while he can . There are , literally , almost no such things in Switzerland as a bad hotel , an uncomfortable bed , or a disappointing meal . One night , for example , I pulled into a town late and with no hotel reservations ? always a bad idea , wherever you might be . All the large hotels were booked to capacity , I found out . A Swiss businessman I 'd met on the train , acting as though he feared this would disgrace his proud country before the world , dedi16o YOUR TRIP ABROAD cated himself to the project of finding me a hotel room . He finally fixed me up in a little place on the edge of town . The next day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He clutched his cheek and turned pale at the thought of an American re-porter having to stop at such a fourth-rate fleabag ? this about a place where I 'd enjoyed a wonderful steak dinner for about a dollar , had a fine continental breakfast for 35 cents , and paid about $1.50 for a magnificent bed in a room that looked as though it had been scrubbed with laundry soap , then dusted with a white silk shirt ! The visitor can check his list of the various factors that make for happy vacationing ? Switzerland has them all : interesting places to see and con venient means of getting there , excellent hotels and restaurants , moderate prices , efficient service , and friendly treatment . Take efficiency , for example . On the Swiss telephone system you can call anyplace in the country just by dialing . You simply dial an intro ductory digit for the city or region , then dial the number . Small country ? Sure , but the length of Switzerland is about the distance between New York and Washington . Try dialing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . The whole Swiss system seems to run , actually , by clockwork . You can set your watch by the arrival and departure of trains ? but the Swiss do n't usually have to set their watches . Thcy expect them to run on time . Make a date with a Swiss at noon , and he 'll be there at r z , not at 11:58 or 1z:oz . One afternoon I was sitting in the living room at the Swiss home of Arnold Gingrich , then Esquire 's European Editor , looking out over Lake Geneva , sampling the good white wine from his vineyards , and waiting for a call from Zurich . Our caller 's secretary had told us he would be back in his office about four , and would phone us then . Gingrich looked at his watch . " Two minutes past four , " he said . " Very un-Swiss . " I told him my watch made it just four on the nose . And at that moment the phone rang ! Yet this almost machinelike efficiency has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might expect from a study of recent European history . The Germans were efficient all right , but at what cost in individual , national , and international liberty ; Mussolini finally made Italian trains run on schedule , but he smashed the soul of Italy at the same time . As a matter of fact , Switzerland violates most of our political cliches . It enjoys discipline without dictatorship , democracy without dis cord , dissension without disruption , differences without discrimination . Included within the limited confines of the Swiss Federation are almost every factor that makes for wars among nations : differences in culture , language , and religion ; economic rivalries , historical strifes , and bitterness . Various Swiss cantons and sections battled each other down through the Middle Ages ; the last Swiss civil war was fought about a century ago and even today citizens of various cantons do not necessarily love each other very deeply . The fact that they have subjected their differences to national unity , and the demonstration that men can even dislike each other without going to war about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable , and raise your hopes for international government some time in the future . In Switzerland the rights and dignity of the individual are ranked above almost every other consideration . In a nation of minorities , the right of every minority is protected by law and custom . There are , for example , four national languages : German , Trench , Italian , and Romansch ? of which two dialects are recognized . The Federal Constitution protects the right of every Swiss to speak and to transact his business with the government in his own tongue . About 57 per cent of the population is Protestant , 41 per cent Catholic , and z per cent belong to other sects . Each creed is equally protected , none is favored , none is forbidden . A church in a small village might hold a Protestant service at nine in the morning , and at ten thirty the Catholic priest takes over for Mass . As an example of Swiss thrift and frugality , of the population Of 4,500 , - o0o a total of 4,036,000 persons have savings bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36o,000 have savings accounts of a thousand dollars and up . Hard work is almost a religion with the Swiss . One of the highest compliments that can be given to a man is to say , " He is a good worker . " Heads of some of the largest watch companies in Switzerland will spend an occasional day at the workbench , just to keep their hand in and maintain personal contact with their workers . Offices open at 8 A.M. , and top executives are at their desks exactly at that time . They knock off at 6 P.m. with a two-hour lunch period ? exactly two hours ? in between . With characteristic efficiency , the Swiss have solved with strict protocol the problem of priority when going through doorways ? and if you 've ever wasted an hour or so while your European friends engaged in a friendly argument over who should go first through a series of doors , you 'll realize that it is a problem . All things being equal , it is the older or more distinguished person who goes through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway last . Thus , if you visit a Swiss businessman at his office you will precede him through any doorways that block your way , but if he accompanies you to your hotel you become the host , and he goes first . Ladies first , always , of course , and if there are several ladies , apply the above rules to them . . There are no slums in Switzerland or unemployment or organized prostitution . Women do not have the vote in Switzerland . I 'm not trying to prove anything , or make any point about cause and effect ? just citing interesting facts . Aside from the all-male voting qualification , Swiss democracy is one of the purest of modern times , with citizens taking a close and loving interest in communal , cantonal , and national affairs , and making frequent use of the initiative and referendum to make their wishes known . In the rural and more sparsely populated cantons , an ancient type of popular assembly called the Landsgemeinde has survived , at which the male citizens , carrying swords symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main square of the capital town to hear reports submitted by their political representatives , hold elections and vote new laws by a show of hands . All these factors in Swiss life make themselves felt to the casual visitor , if only in a sense of the basic decency of the people of the country . Every // canton and region has its own specific charms for the tourist , based on scenery , recreational facilities , and local cultures . WHAT TO DO AND WHAT TO SEE : You 'd better decide right at the beginning just what sort of vacation in Switzerland you want . You can spend your time in the country very happily as a sight-seer , wandering all over the place and seeing as much as you have time for . Or you can decide what part of Switzerland is particularly for you , then go there . A great deal , too , depends on when you plan to go . Switzerland is truly an all-year vacationland . Spring is probably the loveliest season , when the landscape turns green , flowers spring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a magically clear and sparkling quality . Summer is when the land fills up with tourists , many of them from America but most from other places in Europe ? seeking escape from summer heat in the cool freshness of the Alps . Fall is wonderful , too , all over Switzerland . The woods go crazy in full color , and there 's as much a nip in the air as there is in the brandy , and ? going places ? you do n't get your feet stepped on by the crowds because there 's plenty of room to roam around in . Not that things are ever too crowded in Switzerland these days . Forrmcrly the bulk of Switzerland 's visitors were English and German . Currency restrictions have greatly decreased the number of British tourists , and Germans still are n't traveling outside their own country to any considerable extent . The increased number of American visitors to Switzerland is not yet great enough to make up for the missing British and German tourists . However , it 's probably as a winter resort that Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-December practically the entire country becomes one great ski area . If you 're seeking winter sports in an atmosphere of international society you 'll probably go to St. Moritz , scene of the last winter Olympics and one of the most famous snow centers in the world . St. Moritz in the winter season is extremely fashionable , and if you like rubbing elbows with royalty , to see whether any of it rubs off , it 's St. Moritz by all means . ( Or by any means , if you have trouble making the tariff . ) However , if it 's just skiing you 're after , Switzerland offers scores of well-developed resorts and thousands of mountainsides for you to slide down off of . Geneva is probably as good a place as any to start your Swiss visit , whatever the season . It 's a principal gateway from France , features a beautiful location at the end of Lake Geneva , and symbolizes more than any other city , perhaps , Switzerland 's unique position as the great neutral among the nations of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browse among the buildings of the League of Nations , some of which were n't completed before the great dream which was their inspiration had died . Yet the fine feeling of tradition you 'll sense all around will remind you that civilization has survived crises before . From Geneva you 'll probably take the train along Lake Leman , another name for Lake Geneva , to the university city of Lausanne , capital of the French-speaking canton of Vaud . Lausanne rivals Geneva as a leading tourist center of French Switzerland . Its lakefront district of Ouchy ( proSWITZERLAND-EUROPEAN // nounced " oo-she " ) has long been a favorite haunt of writers and painters . East of Lausanne lies the famous tourist section known as the Swiss Riviera , where the combination of east-west mountains cutting off the north winds , winter sunshine striking the southern slopes , and the moderating influence of the lake have created an almost Mediterranean climate in the shadow of the snow-capped Alps . Vineyards in this area produce some of Switzerland 's finest white wines . The district includes such wellknown resorts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to the fine , old medieval town of Fribourg , on the approximate boundary between the French and German-speaking sections of the country . Next along the route is Berne , capital of Switzerland and , of all important Swiss cities , the one which has most successfully preserved its old-world charm . Lucerne is the heart of tourism in central Switzerland and is the jumping-off point for excursions along the Lake of the Four Cantons and the spectacular climb up Rigi . Zurich is Switzerland 's largest city , a cultural center , and its commercial and industrial capital . The atmosphere of Zurich , like its architecture , is a unique blend of the medieval with the very modern . As is true of many of Switzerland 's leading cities , Zurich has a magnificent lakeside location . One important exception is Basel , which has instead a unique situation astride the Rhine at the junction of the Swiss , French , and German frontiers . Basel ( Basle or Bale ) is probably the only big city along the Rhine which looks exactly as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sections are little changed from the fifteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries . Switzerland is one place where the countryside is likely to be of greater interest to the traveler than are the cities . Regional tourist centers include Interlaken in the Bcrnese Oberland , and a " must " on the itineraries of many American visitors ; the canton of Valais , which includes the highest Alpine peaks ; the Grisons , with such outstanding winter resorts as St. Moritz and Davos ; and the warm and sunny canton of Tessin , where people are gay , and the whole place reminds you of a scrubbed-up Italy . , WHAT AND WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK : The gastronomic part of your vacation will be well taken care of in Switzerland . In general , Swiss cooking follows the fashion of the country on the nearest frontier ? French cuisine in the west , German cooking in the north and east , and Italian style down south in the Tessin . In addition , the Swiss have many dishes distinctively their own . The country abounds in regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is fondue , a cheese which has been melted in wine , into which everybody dunks hunks of bread . Following are some of the food specialties , according to region : Basel : Like German cooking , heavy and rich in fats , suited to the climate which is inclined to be cloudy and gray in the winter . Soups a specialty . Durchgetriebene Hirnsuppe , consisting mainly of brains passed through a sieve , with butter , flour , eggs , and broth added .

Neuchatel and the Jura region : Influenced greatly by the neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , particularly the bondelle , found only here . Also brochet , palcc , and trout . Tripes a Ia Neuchateloise , a regional specialty , also two kinds of sausage . Fondue very popular here , made with local wines and a dash of native kirsch . Cheese and fruit tarts are local specialties . The favorite cheeses of the region are Vacherin de Jura , a white cheese somewhat similar to Camembert , and Tete de Moine , a tasty round cheese . Most Neuchatel wines are white and slightly sour . However , a very good red wine is produced at Cortaillod , and Mauler , an excellent champagne , is grown in the canton . French Switzerland : The sections near Geneva and Lake Leman grow some of the finest white wines of Switzerland . Trout and the perch caught in the lake are regional specialties , as arc the many delicious sausages and hams produced in this part of the country . Mushrooms on toast are also very popular in French Switzerland . Other specialties include crayfish and frogs ' legs , and ? during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Renowned for its pastries . Bundnerfieisch , a dried meat , Salsiz sausages , livcrsvrrrst , meat pies , ragouts , and young goat and venison in season . The best-known wine of the region is the red Veltliner , and there arc many fine light red and white wines produced in this area , as well as Passuggcr , one of the best Swiss mineral waters . Tessin : Bordering Italy , Tessin 's cuisine is somewhat similar to that of neighboring Piedmont , with most of the cooking being done in olive oil , with a liberal use of garlic , onion , and aromatic herbs . Dishes such as polenta , rice , and spaghetti are served just as they are in Italy . Spaghetti , slightly undercooked , is eaten with melted butter and grated Parmesan cheese and is a staple of the Tessin diet . Other regional specialties include minestrone soup , quail , veal and pork roasts served in a thick , brown gravy ; rice , salmon , and speckled trout , sausages and local cheeses . Berne : Outstanding local specialty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham , and boiled beef ? all cooked together and served with sauerkraut and potatoes . Another is split pea soup cooked with pigs ' knuckles . Zurich : One of the best-known local dishes is Leberspiessli , made of pieces of calves ' liver wrapped in sage leaves and speared alternately with strips of bacon , and fried with butter and onions . Another local specialty is Geschnetzeltes Kalbileisch , made of veal cut up into small pieces , broiled and served with a cream or white wine sauce . It is eaten with Rosti , Switzerland 's national potato dish , made by broiling potatoes , then slicing them thin , pressing into a cake and browning in butter or fat . Zurich is also noted for its pastries and its white wines , among them the famous Riesling-Sylvaner . While you 're in Zurich you 'll probably want to dine in at least one of the medieval guildhalls . Practically all the guilds have restaurants open to the public and serving excellent meals . Among the best are those of the // Zimmerleuten ( carpenters ) , Saran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other good Zurich restaurants include the Zuristube Huguenin , on the Bahnhofstrasse , which serves sonic of the best hors d'oeuvres to be found in Europe , including pate de foie gras , lobster and vacherin , an excellent blue trout found in Swiss rivers ; the Rcblaus restaurant , a famous old place located in a renovated medieval building opposite the tailors ' guildhouse ; the Congress Hall restaurant on the lake ; grill room of the Hotel Baur an Lac ; the Veltliner Keller ; Restaurant Franais of the Hotel Eden on the lake ; the rotisserie of the Hotel Storchen ; restaurant of the Hotel Savoy Baur en Ville , and the Zurichorn Fischstubc , a fish restaurant on a pier overlooking the lake , about a mile out of town , open only in the summer . In Geneva , the Restaurant du Nord on the Rue du Rhone was a favorite of diplomatists during the League of Nations days , and still is popular with lovers of good food in French Switzerland . Another of the best restaurants in town is La Perle du Lac on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer season . Other good Geneva restaurants include Le Bearn , Longchamp , A 1'Or du Rhone , and La Bonne Auberge . If you 're stuck for a good place to eat in Switzerland , though I ca n't see why you would be , you 're always safe in going to the restaurants at the railroad stations . They 're carefully supervised by the management of the state railroads , and you can count on the food 's being good . And all the first-class hotels have excellent dining rooms which are usually among the best eating places in town , wherever you happen to be . In addition to liking wine , the Swiss are great beer drinkers , especially in the German-speaking sections . It is also the custom to drink kirsch or mare after more or less festive meals . Marc is a brandy distilled from pressed grapes after the wine has been drawn off ? quite similar to the branda of Nice . One sips mart ? dnc does not gulp same . Three shots , and you take off from the nearest ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marc du Pere Mathieu . In this case Pere Mathieu , or Father Matthew , is represented by the wooden figure of a man climbing a wooden ladder ? the whole business placed mysteriously in the bottle by a process known only to the distillers . When you see the little man climbing up and down the ladder you 've had too much . , - HOW TO BE MERRY : Nobody ever recommended Switzerland for night life , and you 'll probably do most of your carousing in Paris , but there 's at least one place you 've got to try . That 's Mary 's Old Timer 's Bar on the Augustinergasse in the old section of Zurich . It 's just a little saloon , but it was home to 2o,000 GIs who visited the place during their postwar leaves in Switzerland . Fran Mary Lang , who owns it , called it a speakeasy ? to make visiting GIs feel at home ? gave all servicemen their first drink on the house , and presented them with little souvenir handkerchiefs to send home to their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aunt Mary , " spending most of their Zurich time at her place , and tearing off their insignia and shoulder patches for her collection which , peculiarly enough , includes patches of some outfits which never left the States . It might have been the barmaids , who are among the prettiest in // Switzerland , or maybe it was the atmosphere of all-round hospitality and general Gemutlichkeit that permeates the bistro ? but after I 'd been there an hour or so I yanked off my discharge button ( that was shortly after the war , when people were discharge buttons ) and tossed it into Aunt Mary 's collection . Thanks to the fact that GIs on leave in Switzerland were there long enough to make a good impression but were pulled out before they had a chance to wear out their welcome , the personal prestige of Americans is very high in Switzerland , especially with the Swiss girls . Most of them are buxom , friendly , rosy-checked , and eager to try out their English which , . generally , is very good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIs taught to innocent European ladies who knew no better . Swiss girls go to " dancings , " frequently in pairs , in the afternoons , where it is not considered bad form to strike up acquaintanceships without a formal introduction . Contrary to a widespread impression , Swiss girls do not generally yodel . The " dancings " arc generally crowded in the afternoon , close about midnight . Some of the best-known " clancings " in Zurich are the Petit Palais of the Hotel Baur an Lac , the 1'Iascottc at the Corso Theatre , the Fantasio and the Astoria . Among the most popular Zurich bars are the Odeon , the Golden Bar Palazzo , the Bellerive Hotel , the Schiffiande Bar , the Hummcr Bar of the IIotcl St. Gotthard , and the bars at the Savoy and Carlton Elite hotels . In Gcncva the better " dancings " include Clicz Maxim 's , Chez Monique , Cabaret Bersin , Lc Pcroquct , Le Grillon , Palais d'Hivcr , La Chesa , and Le Moulin Rouge . At Lausanne it 's the Lausanne Palace , Tabaris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Old India , Splendide , and Locanda . Cabarets , which are just about the same as the " dancings , " but with floor shows , include the Coup do Soleil and Bonnet d'Ane . Lucerne dances at the Kursaal , Huguenin , Cecil , Stadthofgarten , Hermitage , Gutsch , and in many of the hotels . In Basel there 's dancing at the Baselstab , Drei Konige , Kuchlin , Kunsthalle , Odeon , Regina , Singerhaus , Storchen , and Zur Rheinbrucke. just about the only night life that really glitters in Switzerland is at St. Moritz during the season , and that 's centered pretty much in the three best hotels : the Palace , Kulm , and Suvretta ; and the Chesa Veglia , practically the only night spot in town . , 4 FOR THE SPORTSMAN AND SPORTSWOMAN : It 's a toss-up whether Switzerland offers more to the sight-seer or the sportsman . Certainly you can find every sport in the world in Switzerland , except for such regional specialties as American football and baseball , and polo . Switzerland 's winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a quick retracing here . With the Alps covering three-fifths of its territory , Switzerland literally becomes a nation on skis from mid-Deccrnber to mid-April , while the real ski fan enjoying the sport much later in the season , and the diehard addicts take advantage of the year-round skiing on the jungfrau . Expert skiers prefer Davos , St. Moritz , Wengen , Murren , Kleine Schcidegg , and Zermatt ; while Gstaad , Villars , Arosa , Lenzcrheide , // Engelberg , Grindewald , and Klosters all are popular with skiers of vary ing degrees of proficiency . Most winter sports centers also feature skating , hockey , tobogganing , curling , and skijoring ? which means skiing behind a horse or team . Switzerland is the center of European mountaineering , and the Alps are to the followers of this exacting and highly specialized sport what the big leagues are to a ball player . The Swiss national sport is rifle shooting , and every Swiss of military age must take his rifle out to the firing range of his town or village at least once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and mountainsides are full of Swiss sharpshooters stalking deer and rabbits during the season . Fishing is another favorite sport , particularly among visitors . Fly-fishing is a joy in Switzerland , with the trout rising in the spring as soon as the water is no longer clouded by the melting snow . There 's beautiful native and rainbow trout and salmon awaiting you in the Rhone , Inn , Doubs , and thousands of other rivers and mountain streams ; and lake trout , perch , and pike in hundreds of Swiss lakes . As for the more commonplace varieties of active sports , you 'll find them all in Switzerland ? swimming , sailing , canoeing , and motorboating on the lakes ; golf and tennis near most of the towns and resorts ; the European variety of football and riding almost everywhere . WHAT TO WEAR : Best general rule is to take the sort of clothes you 'd wear in the northern part of the United States according to season , as the Swiss climate is fairly comparable , though somewhat rainier during the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is more or less typical for the so-called Swiss " midlands " ( I 3oo ? 1600 ft . ) . Since you 're on vacation you 'll probably wear a sports jacket and slacks ( or skirt ) combination more frequently than you do for the workaday world at home . Men should be sure to take one dark business suit along for more formal occasions , but you probably wo n't need evening clothes . A dinner or cocktail dress would be formal enough for the average woman visitor . At least one pair of shoes in your luggage should be comfortable enough for happy walking . That 's true wherever you go on your vacation // abroad , but it 's particularly true in Switzerland , where mountain trails call you out of doors and away from the paved streets of the cities .. WHAT TO BUY : The story goes that only three Americans have ever visited Switzerland without buying a watch ? and they were men by the name of Waltham , Hamilton , and Elgin ! You 'll probably want to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for yourself and as gifts . Remember that you 're allowed to bring $500 worth of purchases back into the United States with you duty-free , if you 're a resident of the United States and you have n't been out of the country and claimed the exemption within the previous six months . However , you 're not allowed to bring anything in with you asked for by another person except as a gift , and the customs inspector must be convinced that the articles you bring in with you are not intended for resale . Standard prices for 15-jewel men 's wrist watches in stainless steel cases run from about $22.50 to $45 . The same movements in gold cases cost between $62 and $85 , with prices going on up into the stratosphere for really superb watches . Women 's wrist watches run about zo per cent higher . Chronographs ? those watches with all the gadgets ? cost between $30 and $6o in stainless steel cases . It 's a good idea to buy one of the well-known name-brands of watches , since many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a number of manufacturers produce watches for export with comparatively unknown names yet of excellent craftsmanship . Other good gift buys include lighters , music boxes , embroideries , lightweight portable typewriters , home movie cameras , and binoculars . WHERE TO STAY : As practically all Swiss hotels are good , the best procedure is to figure out what you can spend , then look up a hotel with accommodations in that price range . Rates , single , without meals , begin at about $1.50 and run up to about $10 a day . Do n't be shocked if your room does n't have a private bath , and you have to pay a franc or two extra per bath , even in a luxury hotel . The custom of all rooms with private bath is not nearly so prevalent in Switzerland as it is in the United States . But the Swiss are such a religiously clean people that you need have no qualms about using a public bath , which is probably at least as clean as your private bath would be in a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel ( coffee , white bread or rolls , jam , . honey , butter , and cheese ) will cost about 75 cents , and your other meals at good hotels will run about $a.00 to $3.00 each . Most of the large hotels also have en pension rates ( with meals ) which begin after stays of three days or more , and you 'll find you will do better that way , budgetwise , if you 're staying any length of time in one place . You get a further break too , generally , on weekly rates . Hotels that stand out in retrospect from my last Swiss trip include the fabulous Palace in St. Moritz ? one of the really great resort hotels of Europe , the lovely old Schweizerhof on the lakeside in Lucerne , the beautiful Beau Rivage in Geneva and the smart Carlton Elite in Zurich . // 4 WHAT TO TIP : Hotels add service charges of 15 per cent of your bill for one day 's stay , 12 per cent for two or three days , and 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one place , at least , where the service charge really is supposed to take care of your hotel tipping for regular services . That means services like the bellhop 's bringing up your bags , the doorman calling a cab , etc . For special services , such as asking a maid to sew on a button , you might give a tip of about a franc . ( You can figure the Swiss franc as being worth about 25 cents . There are loo centimes in a franc . ) Give the checkroom gal and the washroom attendant 20 ? 25 centimes . Cabdrivers are tipped about 10 ? i 5 per cent of the meter , the larger tip at night . 10 ? 15 per cent is considered an adequate tip for the barber in Swiss shops . You do n't tip the hall porter who shines the shoes you leave outside your door at night , since he participates in the general service kitty .  --  3 HOW TO GET THERE : Trans World Airline runs direct Constellation service between New York and Zurich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva and $403 to Zurich one way and $718 to Geneva and $725 to Zurich round trip . Sixty-day winter excursion rates between October 1 and April 3o are $528.6o round trip to Geneva and $533.70 to Zurich . There is also the 15-day winter excursion rate of $442.70 to Zurich and $438.40 to Geneva , good between January 1 and March 31 . Swissair , the Swiss national airline , operates between New York and Geneva and Zurich with DC-4s at fares of $384 one way and $691.20 round trip , Geneva ; and $387 one way and $696.6o round trip , Zurich . Pan American World Airways flies a transatlantic Constellation service between New York and Zurich via Lisbon and Madrid ( with connecting Constellations of its subsidiary , Panair do Brazil , at Lisbon ) . In addition , all the great transatlantic airlines run flights to Switzerland from their terminals ( Air France from Paris , KLM from Amsterdam , British European Airways from London , Sabena from Brussels , and Scandinavian from Copenhagen ) . There 's excellent train service to Switzerland from all the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent trains , the Swiss , of course , are famous for them . Of the 3600 miles of Swiss railroad , all but about 3 per cent are electrified , and the trains are run like the New York subways ( the frequency is what I refer to , not the cleanliness ! ) . Rail is definitely the way to travel in Switzerland , since distances are too short to make flying within the country worth-while , and the busses are mainly for short hauls and sight-seeing , not through-transportation . You can go from anywhere in the country to practically anyplace else within three or four hours , most of the trains are as scrubbed-looking as the landscape , the diners serve plain but good meals at reasonable prices , and the trains pull into a terminal , discharge their passengers , load up for the return trip , then pull out again within seconds ? not minutes ? of their scheduled times . Travel second class on most Swiss trains . Third class is likely to be crowded , and the frugal Swiss are highly suspicious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
