In Chicago 's Blue Note Caf last week , the tiny bandstand was jammed so tight that the grand piano dangled off the platform and had one leg supported by a post . Glittering in the colored lights was an instrument few jive cats had ever seen-a harp , and across the back gleamed a picket fence of big tubular chimes . Altogether there were 21 players and 77 instruments , with ten microphones scattered among them . A spectacled , shy young man named Eddie Sauter-one of the leaders of the band-wrote something on a slate and held it up for all the players to see . They went into Moonlight on the Ganges the way it had never been heard before on the shores of Lake Michigan , the Mississippi , the Hudson , the Nile or the Ganges . <P> The band seemed to be playing musical chairs . The percussion man ran back &; forth between kettle drums , cymbal and a toy drum , jangled some bells on the way , hammered a xylophone and , with evident pleasure , whammed a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even recorders ; Sauter himself picked up a kazoo and produced sounds very much like bagpipes . Again the slate and another tune : The Doodletown Fifers . Two men played the piccolo , two the baritone saxophone , one the tenor saxophone . Then the three sax players put down their instruments and whistled . By the time they picked them up again , the second piccolo had switched to tenor sax , quickly moved on to flute , then back to piccolo . <P> Chest-Beater . The result was not , as might be expected , a kind of Spike Jones pandemonium , but gently exuberant , whimsical and thoroughly disciplined . Eddie Sauter and his partner Bill Finegan are running the most original band heard in the U.S. in years . <P> As arrangers for such once radical leaders as Benny Goodman , Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller , Finegan and Sauter got restless , last year started recording their own arrangements for RCA Victor ( TIME , Aug. 11 , 1952 ) , finally took their own band on tour this summer . They decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We wanted to go high , so we wrote for piccolos , " says Sauter . " We wanted to go low , so we added the tuba . " Among the band 's special effects : Finegan pounding his chest vigorously to imitate horses ' hooves . <P> Their orchestration is highbrow , including a lot of counterpoint , but every Sauter-Finegan arrangement has either a palpable atmosphere or a clear story line or both , without ever tripping over its danceable rhythm . With the precision of a Marine parade and the grace of a lace handkerchief waving on the sidelines , the big band runs through a notably moist version of Rain , a playful Midnight Sleighride , a dreamy April in Paris . Jazz-wise listeners only had an occasional sense of too much novelty for its own sake . <P> Juggling Act . The band 's tour has drawn interested crowds . Wherever there is a dance floor , about half the crowd uses it , the other half stands open-mouthed and gawks at the activity onstage . At Chicago 's Blue Note , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged couples just gawked , smiled happily and applauded . <P> Arrangers Sauter and Finegan were a little puzzled by their own success . " Maybe . " said Sauter , " people just like to watch a juggling act . "
