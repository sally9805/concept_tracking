IN THE TIME OF GREENBLOOM ( 407 pp. ) - Gabriel Fielding-Morrow ( $4.75 ) . <P> The title of this exciting new novel sounds like an archaic phrase in celebration of spring . But Greenbloom is a man , not a season . More important , he is a state of mind . Greenbloom is awareness , sentience , ceaseless war on man 's most deadly enemy , which is not cancer or heart disease , but habit-all the routines of thinking , feeling and doing that enable humans to get through life without living it . <P> The soul that Greenbloom saves is that of adolescent John Blaydon , who is typical of the schoolboy in the English novel during the past 100 years-sensitive , mildly precocious , ignored by adults except when he exasperates or embarrasses them . John Blaydon does both frequently , for he is incapable of committing a transgression without being caught . When he goes swimming in the nude with nubile Victoria Blount , she almost drowns , and John is discovered by an entire house party as he sits astride her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arraigned by fate when a homosexual classmate slips into his bed . Instead of being totally pliant or totally repelled , John 's mixed reactions create a hysteric scene . But it takes a country vacation with Victoria Blount and her mother to bring into the open an evil that has been only hinted at . John Blaydon , though innocent , becomes notorious in all England . John 's parents-his father is a vicar- hope that the scandal will vanish if they ignore it . He is sent to a different school . His name is changed . But to those who know , and those who do not , he is a queer duck . To John himself , life seems as opaque and resistant as if he were living on the ocean floor . <P> Wrong Way Corrigan . Enter Horab Greenbloom , a character so prodigious that he nearly runs away with the book . Horab can only be described in superlatives of wealth , intelligence , vitality and childishness . He drives his Bentley at top speed , depending for guidance on his passengers ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Good God , you should have warned me minutes ago . It nearly hit us " ) . He flies his deHavilland Moth with the aplomb of Wrong Way Corrigan . Aiming for France , he makes a forced landing instead on a race track in Ireland . Even when he hears a native 's brogue , Greenbloom insists that he is near Chantilly , dismisses the fellow as talking " some kind of patois . . . He must be a Basque . " <P> Greenbloom is always on the move : mentally , from Wittgenstein to Sartre ; physically , from London to Paris ; metaphysically , from Jewish Orthodoxy to agnosticism . Greenbloom , thinks John , " might equally well have been chasing something with every good intention or fleeing from it with a black heart . " Indefinably but truly , Greenbloom helps John to the unlocking of his heart and mind .
