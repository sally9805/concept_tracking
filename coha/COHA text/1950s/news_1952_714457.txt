txt A plan to create an important center of interdenominational religious learning open to students " without regard to their religious background " was announced here today by Dr. James B. Conant , president of Harvard University . The plan , which hinges on a 1$5,000,000 fund-raising drive , provides for " revitalizing " the 136-year-old Harvard Divinity School under new leadership with an enlarged faculty nominated by an interdenominational board of distinguished clergymen . It calls also for an enlarged student body of 300 and an expanded curriculum " designed to provide comprehensive education in the common tenets of Christianity . " The center would train college graduates for the ministry and for advanced scholarly studies , with the general purpose of strengthening religious education in the United States . " Ilae New Yor . Tlmes Stud/.r Lord . O'Brian The plan is based on a report made in 1947 by a special commission , headed by John Lord O'Brian , that was appointed to investigate the Harvard Divinity School and make recommendations for its future . Mr. O'Brian is a member of the Washington law firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee Mr. O'Brian is general chairman of a new committee formed to obtain the necessary funds for the project and , it was said , advance subscriptions of $500,000 already had been made . Graham B. Blaine , vice chairman of the board of the Bank of the Manhattan Company , is chairman of the executive committee for the project . Eight leading Protestant clergymen have consented to serve as a board to make faculty appointment recommendations to the university 's governing boards . The clergymen are : The Right Rev. Angus Dun , Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Washington ; Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam of the Methodist Church ( New York area ) ; Dr. J. Seelye Bixler , president of Colby College ; Dr. Harvie Bransconab , chancellor of Vanderbilt University ; Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin , for many years president of Union Theological Seminary ; Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick , minister emeritus of the Riverside Church , New York ; Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr , Professor of Ap plied Christianity , Union Theological Seminary , and Dr. Charles E.

Dr. Sperry Is Extolled The announcement declared that Dr. Sperry " served with great ability and devotion and has continued to serve beyond normal retirement to permit time for the studies which resulted in the new plan for the school . " In the 1947 report , the commission headed by Mr. O'Brian expressed the belief that " the most helpful intercourse between the religious , the philosophic and the scientific elements of a culture can be attained in the atmosphere of freedom prevailing in our great liberal arts centers of learning . " " In those centers , " the report aid , " neither any modern nor ancient presupposition of faith which imparts meaning to life should remain unexamined . There , also , the modem idea that it is possible to live and act without such presuppositions should be examined . " The report declared that it was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith should be subjected to criticism in order that historically contingent expressions I of timeless truth may not betray , them into obscurantism . " " There , too , " it added , " the modern firms of faith should be reexamined so that superficial answers to profound questions may AIDS ** TIORTNTE CI Fabian Bachrach Graham B. Blaine be detected and strongly challenged . " In an article that will appear tomorrow in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin under the title " What Future for Our Divinity School ? " Mr. O'Brian quoted the 1947 report as declaring that it was " reasonable to expect that the events of the last quarter century will not soon be forgotten ; rather they will continue to present ever-re-i curring challenges to multitudesi of men who , consciously or unconsciously , seek to solve the problems of life 's meaning , motive and purpose . " " When the - individual confronts ultimate questions that involve his destiny , his life and his final attitudes toward the world , " the re- port said , " the corrective of thel moral disciplines becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in human concerns can not be ignored . While religion today is no longer recognized as a universally cohesive force , the Christian tradition , with its peculiar , sense of values , does provide strong ties of common loyalty and understanding that transcend the boundaries of nation , race and class . " In his article in the forthcoming alumni bulletin , Mr. O'Brian also noted that the commission 's report emphasized that there was " a general shortage in the supply of welleducated ministers  --  partly because of the gradual rise in educational standards demanded  --  but also because entirely new fields are opening up requiring the services of men trained both in religious learning and Christian sociology . " Demand for Chaplains Growing " Instances of these needs , " the article declared , " were the rapid growth of the demand for chaplains for colleges , schools , and even industrial units , and also the need for teachers of historical Christianity . In his statement today , which was made on behalf of the governing boards of the university , Dr. Conant said that " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to have the Harvard Divinity School revitalized and given more the character of a center of religious learning . " " This is due in part , " he explained , " to world conditions , in part to the realization of moral laxity in our own country and in part to the necessity for strengthening the ministry of Protestant denominations . " Dr. Conant declared that the long-range aspect of the plan envisioned the increase of the present $1,000,000 endowment of the divinity school to $7,000,000 . He said that when the first $2,000,000 had been raised by general subscription , the university 's corporation would contribute an additional $500,000 , and when an additional $3,000,000 was subscribed the corporation would contribute another $500,000 to make the total sum of $6,000,000 in new money . Dr. Conant ' said that " for a reasonable time , pending a canvass for the necessary subscriptions the corporation will continue to make up the annual deficits of the school out of the unrestricted income of the university . " In announcing the creation of the divinity school 's endowment fund campaign Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that there would be " a strong response among Harvard men generally to the plan for revitalizing the divinity school . " Strong Ministry Called Bulwark They declared that " a strong ministry is one of the bulwarks of America " and that " an interdenominational school in a great university Is a highly suite/go place for the education of ministers . " They added : " Harvard should do its share in this work . " The joint statement observed that although the divinity school had existed since 1816 and " has an honorable record to which many devoted men have contributed , " it had " long been neglected " in the matter of financial support . The statement said that - " the last real effort " to raise funds for the school occurred in 1879 . " The raising of the $5,000,000 fund , " the statement said , " presents both a test and an opportunity to all Harvard alumni of whatever religious affiliation .
