A calm , small , square-cut sculptor named Costantino Nivola has finished what may be the biggest single bas-relief in modern history . Darius the Mede and Nebuchadnezzar ordered bigger ones , but the ancient rulers never saw anything remotely like Nivola 's . <P> Made of reinforced concrete , in 132 numbered panels weighing 110 tons , the bas-relief lay face down last week in back of Nivola 's summer home at East Hampton , N.Y . Seven huge platform trucks will soon transport it to Hartford , Conn. , where it will be fitted to the steel frame of Mutual Insurance Co. of Hartford 's new office building . In place , the bas-relief will serve as a 110-ft. - long wall over the building 's main entrance . It is an abstraction with overtones of cubism - an endless procession of angular , cloudy , faceless figures that seem to shift , melt and glide . <P> Preference for Form . Nivola 's art lacks drama , which bothers him not a jot : " You know , many artists have been concerned to show the fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a preference for form . " That preference arises from many years of handling and cutting solid shapes . Nivola was born 46 years ago in a Sardinian village , and early apprenticed as a mason . He graduated from masonry to ornamental stucco work , and eventually won a scholarship to Milan 's Art Institute . But he says he learned more as a skilled workman than as an art student . <P> The grinding days of Nivola 's apprenticeship are now far past . The forms he likes to make are in great demand ; recently they have come to adorn such varied projects as the Manhattan showroom for Olivetti typewriters , a war memorial at Falls Church , Va . ( TIME , Oct. 10 , 1955 ) . " Because of the privileges of history , " Nivola says with quiet satisfaction , " we have arrived at the point where we do not have to please the king . On the other hand , we do not work to please the public . The artist must give not something that is demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Solid Sand Castles . What makes the contents of Nivola 's pocket economically feasible is a technique of his own invention . While amusing his children building sand castles on the beach at East Hampton , he conceived the idea of sculpting in damp sand and casting directly in concrete . A certain amount of sand sticks to Nivola 's concrete casts , providing color and texture plus an odd feeling that the bas-relief , once erected , may slide away like sand at any moment . <P> To avoid " the invasions of the birds , " Nivola keeps his bas-reliefs fairly flat , but the play of sunlight and shadow over their pocked , planed , humped and dovetailed surfaces gives an illusion of depth , elaborate richness and almost of motion . Their apparent coolness is partly compensated by an underlying Sardinian warmth . Sculptor Nivola 's most abstract conceptions are based on careful sketches of his wife , his children and their dog ; they hint , vaguely but happily , at life in the flesh .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
