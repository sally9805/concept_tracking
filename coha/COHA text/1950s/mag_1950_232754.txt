Nearly a year ago , New York City 's Superintendent of Schools William Jansen summoned a teacher into his office and asked him this question : " Are you now , or were you ever , a member of the Communist Party ? " The teacher refused to answer , and in time , seven others did the same . Last May , Superintendent Jansen suspended all eight for " insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher . " Since then , New York City has been trying to decide whether Dr. Jansen had the legal right to do what he did . <P> Last week , after a special trial of the eight , set up by the Board of Education and presided over by Manhattan Lawyer Theodore Kiendl , the city got a verdict . Ruled Kiendl : since the Communist Party has " at all pertinent times been dedicated to the advocacy of the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States . . . membership in the party constitutes cause for dismissal of a teacher . . . " Therefore , said Kiendl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the question he did , and it was the duty of each teacher to answer . <P> A man " may have the right to be a member of the Communist Party , " continued Kiendl , " but he has no constitutional right to be at the same time a teacher in our public schools ... If and when academic freedom is relied on to permit the existence of a clear and present danger of the injection into youthful minds of any subversive doctrine , it is no longer academic freedom , but unrestrained academic license . . . " <P> As was to be expected , the defendants declared they would take their case " if necessary to the highest court in the land . " Meanwhile , Superintendent Jansen had been reinforced in his right to ask questions , and would continue to do so whenever he thought it necessary .
