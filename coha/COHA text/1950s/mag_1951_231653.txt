The road to Coolspring , in Virginia , is pleasant in early spring . Down the Blue Ridge slopes into the Shenandoah Valley , roadside plaques mark historic battles and gallant deeds of bygone days . At the foot of the mountains , the route to Coolspring becomes a mud road that could not have been very different in the days when Washington surveyed the area . Finally the road turns in at a gate marked " Monastery " and rolls across pastureland to an ancient fieldstone house on a hill . <P> There the visitor drops another 700 years into the past . <P> Corks in a Bottle . The Cistercian monastery of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart , at Coolspring , is the ninth Trappist community in the U.S. , the newest in full operation , and follows the full medieval rule . Last week , on the 950 acres surrounding the mansion which was once the scene of glittering Southern balls , 32 Trappists were busily preparing for their silent life of work , prayer and meditation . Since last July , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kitchen . The old kitchen building has been turned into a simple chapel , with highly polished stalls . " The only trouble with the stalls , " said burly Father Peter , " one of the few Trappists permitted to talk to visitors , " is that they are just 18 inches wide , and I 'm 22 inches across . " <P> Added Father Gabriel , the third Superior , who is portly , too : " When we rise , it sounds like corks coming out of a bottle . " <P> The monks and novices live in a long file of cubicles , each about four feet across and just long enough to accommodate a narrow , iron-hard sleeping pallet . They do not sleep in their own coffins ( as legend says Trappists once did ) , but the mattresses are hard as a slab in a city morgue . The 60 men are gradually learning the manual labor necessary to run a big estate . At the moment , most of them are hopelessly inept . " The supposition , " laments Father Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't the case here . They 're all city kids . " The community is fattening 200 steers , starting a large vegetable garden and 75 acres of corn . Next year it may begin making Oka cheese , a Trappist specialty . <P> As a group , the Trappists are healthy , youthful , happy-looking . Many are under 20 ; most are well-educated . They include many war veterans , to whom the Trappist life has a great appeal , and a converted Jewish psychiatrist who is the monastery doctor . <P> The Penitential-Life . Like other Trappists , those at Coolspring have forsaken all pleasures , occupy just enough space and use just enough food and clothing to sustain a penitential life . Everybody is equal . Even the abbot and the older monks do their share of menial labor . Differences of opinion are settled by majority vote . <P> For example , Father Gabriel wanted the new monastery ( to be built as soon as the community 's " precarious finances " permit ) in front of the old manor house , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was howled down , " he said . " The monastery will be built on the heights in back of the building . "
