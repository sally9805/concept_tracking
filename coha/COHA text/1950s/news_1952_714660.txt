txt Roll up ! Roll up ! It 's the greatest show in the world ! The greatest national trade show , anyway . And whether your interest at the British Industries Fair lies in a robot baby or a portable sun ( which sounds almost as though it might be the same thing ) you will find it just as surely as you will the silent organ for 24 players and the . smellatorium , or world 's first library of odors . Not to mention the plastic airplane wing , tailored tweeds , heavy enginering , and the last word in streamlined egg whisks , which so . fascinated a Danish buyer that he ordered a thousand the first day , Three Sections For two days ( May 10 and 14 ) of the fair , which runs from May 5 to 16 , the industrial versatility and qtiality of the British Commonwealth is presented as public entertainment at Olympia and Earls Court , two famous London exhibition halls . The third section , at Birmingham , similarly is open every afternoon . But since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither so light nor so comprehensible to Ma , Pa , and the kids as the polychromatic bazaars in London . The rest of the time the crowd consists of the 10,000 people who are trying to sell things , buyers from 110 foreign countries , and those who are purchasing for home markets . If he walked by every stand in the fair , a really enthusiastic visitor would cover 35 miles . The majority merely feel as though they have been receptive to the handouts distributed by so . many of the 2,000 leading manufacturers in 80 different industries . Some Candle Snuffer ! A gentleman with a weakness for statistics tells me that if the exhibition space in the three sections were brought together and placed over London like a candle snuffer , it would extinguish the whole of the West End . So far the motion lacks proposer and seconder . The show ought to be rather reasonable , as the British say , since it costs the equivalent of ten million dollars to put on . This comes rolling back , plus a great deal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual dollars as a result of the fair . I found one of the most interesting exhibits to be the buyers ' lounge . This has the vitality and excitement of a sudden excursion into the capital of a strange exotic country . People are seen in unusual costumes , are heard speaking An unknown tongues . I took those last two sentences from one of the rather specialized handouts I was staggering about with . As a matter of fact , the number of people doing those interesting things in the first few days of the show was smaller than usual and many of the buyers were not buying . As for the Australian buyers , usually so discernible , they were not in evidence at all . Explanation  --  the import restrictions which make British products of only acadetnic interest to Australian purchasers , temporarily . More Goods Released The bright side of this is that it releases more goods for the American market , an optimist explained . What the British now have to do  --  it was added  --  is to approach this with the attitude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is the Briton 's traditional view about solve of their most admired goods . The man who said this was British himself . When the fair was ended , the trends made clear by it will be analyzed carefully . But in relation to Public Opening Day No. 1 , I may present an interim report perhaps in just one field . It was expected to be of the . greatest interest to members of the public under 15 years of age . It can be described as the triumph of Teddy . Cuddly bears have carried the day . All thee exotic intruders have had it . They came . They conquered for a while , but now , as one excited young expert put they have went . The most notable remark by an American housewife is that the British are coming up to parity with the United States in the matter of'kitchen equipment . The mere Irnales wish they could say something of the same sort in the dollar-sterling context of the gleaming , glittering array from the most up-to-date producers in Britain and the other components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
