txt In his testimony this week before the House Committee on . Agriculture Secretary Benson has stressed one point that is of major importance in any discussion of the administration 's farm program . This program , the Secretary told the committee , is not in any sense a departure from the principles embodied in the 1954 program . It does n't represent a change of direction . Its proposals , he indicated , are ( 1 ) to refine some of the details of that program in light of the experiences of the past year or two , and ( 2 ) to intensify the attack on the problem posed by the huge Government-held surplus of farm commodities . With respect to ' the proposed Soil Bank ( which provides for incentive payments for farmers voluntarily reducing their crop acreage below the amounts allotted ) its purpose , said the Secretary , is " to clear away the debris of . past programs so that our present program can go forward . " Representative Cooley , chairman of the committee , protested at one point that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Nineteen Thirties the Democrats had used it to pay farmers for retiring surplus-producing acres . Mr. Cooley 's observation was , of course , quite correct . That fact , though not particularly relevant , is not in dispute . The Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12 , 1933 , authorized a wide range of activities designed to raise the level of farm prices , including authorization for the Government to enter into volun : . tary agreements with farmers for the reduction of acreage . But it could be asserted with equal historical ' accuracy ( and equal irrelevance ) ? that the basic ' concept for the Agricultural Act of 1933 ? the concept known as " Equality for Agriculture ? had originated a dozen years before with two industrialists . They were George N. Peek and Hugh S. Johnson , both executives of the Moline Plow Company of Moline , Ill . It was a Republican Secretary of Agriculture , Henry C. Wallace , who encouraged putting this concept in legislative form , and it was two Republican legislators ? Senator of Oregon and Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the various bills in Congress that comprised the evolutionary background of the legislation of 1933 . No one in the Administration has contended , so far as we are aware , that the 1954 farm program represented a break with the past . On the contrary , they would probably agree that it represented , in essence , an attempt to extend and improve on the basic concept that made its appearance in 1921 , took legislative form in the latter half of the Twenties and was first written into the law in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 . The real break did n't come in 1954 . It came in 1948 , when the- self-appointed " friends of the farmer " in Congress blocked the efforts of enlightened leaders- to carry out the ' directive of the law of 1942 and abandon wartime high , rigid price supports two years after the war emergency was past . High , rigid price supports had ' no ' place in the evolutionary legislative approach to the farm problem that prevailed - prior to ' 1942 . The provision for flexible supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . a departure from the evolutionary process of the Nineteen Twenties . and Nineteen ' Thirties ; , it is a necessary prerequisite to get-. ting back on that road ; a road ' to whose building both political parties have contributed . . ? Those who succeeded in preventing a return to the peacetime evolution of farm policy . have made only one solid contribution to ' such policy . They have contributed an $8.5 billion farm surplus for which there is no visible . existing market . Before the peacetime ' evolution of farm policy . can effectively resume its course the threat of that monumental menace to . the free market must be removed .. In choosing the Soil Bank as an instrument for accomplishing this purpose , as Mr. Benson has indicated , ' the . Administration was , one may well believe , less concerned with the political ancestry of that instrument than with the- question of whether ' it could best perform this particular function .                   @ @
