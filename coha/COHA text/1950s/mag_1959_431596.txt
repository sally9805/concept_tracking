 | a better break for the Mentally Ill Until quite recently , most states locked up their mental patients in the most horrifying kind of madhouses , and forgot about them ... . But today these hospitals are changing dramatically and fast ? while new methods of treatment offer fresh hope for coping with our No. 1 health problem . TO D A Y more Americans are in hospitals for mental illness than for polio , cancer , heart disease , tuberculosis , and all other diseases combined . Half the space in all American hospitals is taken up with mental patients ? some 850,000 of them . It has been estimated that , as things stand now , one out of every twelve American children born today will spend part of his life in a mental hospital . Mental illness is unquestionably America 's number one health problem . Private psychiatric care is expensive . Only 10 per cent of the U. S. population can afford it . So most of our mentally incapacitated are in state hospitals . For years the patients piled up there until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were usually prison-like , walled-off from the community . People viewed them as places to be shunned and , if possible , forgotten . But today for the first time there is real hope that all this may change . So far it is only a hope ; but it has solid foundations ? new discoveries , new ideas , and an awakened public concern . Why do we have state hospitals at all ? How are they changing ? Why ? What is likely to happen to them ? Dr. Benjamin Kovitz , clinical director of Columbus State Hospital , in Ohio ? one of the thousands of devoted unsung doctors who have treated the mentally ill during the years when hope was slender indeed ? recently said : " The first reason mental hospitals came into existence was that we had to have a place for people that just could n't fit in . They had to go somewhere . The state hospital started a hundred years ago , when it was realized that local county homes and jails could seldom do an adequate job . So one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some place to send a person who is disturbing , incomprehensible , fighting , and so on . " Then , from the start , it was observed that patients get better simply by being sent into this kind of place . In the last part of this last century the emphasis changed . Freud came along , and dynamic psychiatry , and we began to make an effort to really understand what was before considered meaningless . And we began to try to apply this understanding in therapy . In this century the somatic therapies came along ? hydrotherapy , insulin and metrazol shock , electroshock , and now the new drugs ? and the hospital came to be viewed as a place to help people get well . " In addition , we now want to make a hospital serve as a place where people can do research . And at the same time we can train new doctors in psychiatry . And so the third hospital function has developed ? research and training . " The state hospital has worked , it 's served some social need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of overhauling and a lot of its timehonored conceptions challenged . " THE STATES ATTACK THE SNAKEPITS PRIMARY responsibility for the care of the mentally ill has traditionally rested with the states . Until a few years ago the states discharged their responsibility poorly . Almost any state hospital presented a picture of falling plaster , leaky plumbing , hopelessly overworked doctors , and utter neglect of the patients . The states were trying to " care for " mental patients for an average of S1.74 per patient per day ( 88 cents in Tennessee ) . But a few years ago major reform began in the states . Its impetus came from the federal government .  | During World War II the rejection and discharge of soldiers for psychiatric reasons made the nation realize its stake in mental health , and in 1946 Congress passed the National Mental Health Act . This Act established the National Institute of Mental Health at Bethesda , Maryland , one of seven Institutes concerned with various diseases . The Institute conducts research of its own at Bethesda . It also grants money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to states for community mental health services . Alter the passage of the Act of 1946 the states bestirred themselves . They started to build buildings . They hired more doctors , nurses , and attendants and raised their salaries . They matched federal grants . They reorganized their mental-health departments . They established preventive programs ? community clinics , childguidance clinics , out-patient clinics . By 1953 the states were spending three times what they had spent on their state hospitals nine years before ? half a billion dollars a year . Some states had multiplied their expenditures fantastically ( luring that same period ? Kansas by 610 per cent . Capital outlays became enormous ? New York alone spent 5350 million building hospitals . New research and training centers were set up . Salaries were increased until in some states mental health officials were earning more than governors . State spending far outran federal . Why all the sudden interest ? Citizens ' groups , such as the National Association for Mental Health and the National Committee Against Mental Illness , helped arouse it . So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it became possible to discuss insanity publicly . Governors discovered that mental health had become the third biggest item in their budgets , exceeded only by schools and roads . About the same time the new psychiatric drugs came along , encouraging citizens to believe that psychotics can be cured ? that pouring money into state hospitals is n't pouring money down a rathole . Finally , during the prosperous postwar years , the country could afford to attend to the sick . Not only is public interest higher ; public understanding is more sophisticated . Not many years ago public interest could be stirred only by exposes of firetrap buildings or brutal beatings in state hospitals . Today people tend to take it for granted that buildings must be satisfactory and care humane ; they want to know what is being done to treat the patients , for they have come to realize that if nothing is done for patients they are not much more likely to get well in a gleaming new building than in a rotting old one ? that brains are needed as well as bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present themselves : Get more of the patients out , or prevent new ones from going in . Getting more out means curing more . This means primarily more doctors , nurses , and attendants . They do not exist . So the states have turned to spending money on training them . It also means finding new treatments , for if a pill should be found that was specific for schizophrenia ? a possibility so remote that most psychiatrists consider it an idle dream ? the hospitals could be halt emptied overnight . So the states have turned to spending money on research . Preventing patients from entering the hospital means better community out-patient clinics , which would find and treat mentally ill persons early , and it means keeping patients who do n't need mental hospitals out of them , such as some aged persons . The state hospital becomes more and more a link in a chain that includes school . clinic , court , after-care homes , and rehabilitation services . DOES GETTING OUT MEAN GETTING WELL ? A T P R E S E N T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some governors feel that the mental health program has been running away with the state budget and the time has come to stabilize . Traveling around the country , one gets the impression that the state hospital programs of Kansas and Massachusetts are among the nation 's best . These programs owe their superiority in no small part to being integrated with the programs of the Menninger Clinic in Kansas , and Harvard University and other colleges in Massachusetts . The same kind of thing has been clone in several other states . But all too often state hospitals have remained isolated backward snakepits scorned and shunned by psychiatrists in the ivory towers of universities and private clinics . At the end of 1956 time was startling news : For the first time ever ? except for a slight decline in 1943 ? the number of patients in our state hospitals declined . Since 1945 the number of patients had been increasing by about 10,000 a year . But by the end of 1956. thirty-four states had discharged as many patients as they took in that year ? or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -I his was n ue even though in  | 1956 first admissions rose to their highest point in history . In 1957 the state hospital population dropped another 3,000 , and the 1958 drop has been estimated at nearly that of 1956 . Why ? Nobody was sure . Several factors seemed to be involved . By 1956 the new psychiatric drugs were controlling patients and enabling many to leave the hospital who could not have left without them . The new atmosphere of hope among patients , doctors , attendants , and relatives helped some patients recover . The number of hospital employees ? doctors , nurses , attendants , others ? had doubled in ten years . Nursing homes , " halfway houses , " after-care clinics , vocational rehabilitation , and other devices helped bridge the gap between the hospital and the community . Doctors in private practice kept some patients out of state hospitals by treating them with the new drugs . New psychiatric wings in general hospitals were having the same effect . Early diagnosis in community clinics sometimes prevented hospitalisation . But these factors apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new state programs to train their own psychiatrists ? mostly five-year plans ? had not yet been felt much in state hospitals . Therefore , further reductions in state hospital populations may still be expected . Now , statistics and predictions in this field must be viewed with much caution . Criteria for discharge vary widely from place to place and from time to time . Moreover , the increase in readmissions suggests the possibility that more patients were being discharged on the new drugs only to relapse and return . Improved social services arranged homes and jobs for patients , thereby getting them out of the hospital but not necessarily in any better health . Finally , the states have spent so much money that their officials feel obliged to show results , and so they devised all sorts of means to get patients out of the hospital ? several states , for example , have begun moving aged patients out of the hospital into nursing homes , which cuts clown the hospital 's residents but may or may not be good for the patients : cleaning up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Nevertheless , even a skeptic must admit that the care of the mentally ill in America has improved considerably in the last ten years and that ? barring a serious economic collapse or other national emergency ? the prospects for further improvement have never been better . MONEY AND PSYCHIATRISTS W H A T do we need for further improvement ? More psychiatrists and more knowledge . Only about 2 per cent of American doctors are certified psychiatrists . There are in the United States only 11,000 psychiatrists ( approximately half of whom are fully-trained and certified by the American Board of Neurology and Psychiatry ) . Only about 3,500 doctors arc in mental hospitals , and not all of them are psychiatrists . It has been estimated that the country needs between 10,000 and 20,000 psychiatrists . But our training institutions are turning out not more than 500 new ones a year . To produce more psychiatrists , Dr. Daniel Blain , medical director of the American Psychiatric Association , has suggested that it may prove necessary to help medical education more . Dr. Bernard H. Hall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training in psychiatry in many medical schools is inferior to the training in all other specialties . " Even though the states are expanding their training progt ams , nearly a third of the residencies in the country are unfilled today . For young doctors do not seem to want to become psychiatrists . Many consider that psychiatry is " anti-religious , " accomplishes little , and confines its practitioners in gloomy state institutions . Such attitudes begin as early as high school . But even if all die psychiatrists in the United  | States were put to work in a single hospital , they would not cure everybody there because they simply do n't know enough , any more than all the cancer specialists in the country could save the lives of all the patients in a single cancer ward . The causes of the major psychoses remain to this day unknown , and so does the cure . The great need is for research . Yet the amount spent on research has been pitifully small . Until a few years ago the sum was usually figured at about $6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ( which , incidentally , spent vastly more for research on hoof-and-mouth disease ) . Today the states alone are probably spending in the neighborhood of S15 million and important private money has become available . The total national expenditure on research is probably close to $30 million a year . Nevertheless , it is not a large sum compared to what is spent for research into other diseases . It is far less than the S53 million spent on cancer research . It is only one tenth of what Americans spend for chewing gum . Some experts believe that so much money is now available that it is embarrassing ? it ca n't be spent because of the shortage of laboratories and trained research personnel . HOW REAL ARE " CURES " BY DRUGS ? MUCH of the research being done today revolves around the new drugs . Since ancient times men have known that certain drugs influenced the human mind : alcohol , hashish , opium , peyotl , others . But drugs played little part in modern psychiatric practice until 1953 , when Thorazine and Serpasil came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of drugs , and more keep coming . Doctors used them eagerly , and they wrought an almost miraculous change in state hospitals ? screaming died out on disturbed wards , patients kept their clothes on , restraint virtually ended , the use of electroshock declined dramatically . Studies are also being made of another class of drugs , the psychotogens , which seem to produce symptoms of insanity . Many of these are very ancient ? peyotl , derived by the Aztecs from a cactus ; teonanacatl , the sacred mushroom of the Aztecs ; caapi , a drug prepared from a jungle vine in the rain forests of the Amazon ; and others . Some are modern synthetics ? mescaline , the active substance in peyotl , which produced the visions and hallucinations of the peyotl eater , and a new synthetic , a d-lysergic acid diethyl- amide tartrate , called LSD-25 , perhaps the most powerful of all the psychotogens . Investigators have thought that could we but learn how LSD25 and mescaline produce " psychosis , " we might know what causes schizophrenia. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to research on causes ? and no wonder , confronted as they are with vast assemblages of psychotic patients . Nobody knows why aspirin works , but it does ; nobody knows how anesthesia works , but it does . The new drugs work ; enough . No definitive evaluation of the drugs has yet been made . Dr. Nathan Kline 's original study at Rockland State Hospital in New York showed that 22 per cent of the patients who received Reserpine were able to leave the hospital . But how many relapse and return ? Nobody is sure . Dr. Kline has said : " Cures ? We do n't even talk about cures . We ca n't . If you 'll tell me what schizophrenia is , then I 'll tell you when we 've cured it . I 've seen patients on drugs who were symptom free . Is that a cure ? I do n't know . In many fields of medicine , we 're satisfied if w-e patch up a patient so he has only a limited disability . In surgery , for instance ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited extent . Only in psychiatry do people insist on total cures . " The new drugs are not accepted universally . Some doctors deny they are any good . According to one doctor , " All we really know is that they keep the patient quiet without putting him to sleep . " A canvass of leading investigators for the New York Annals showed that , while most considered the drugs efficacious , a minority did not and said so vehemently . For a time nearly everybody agreed that if the drugs did nothing else they at least facilitated psychotherapy ; but recently even that has been questioned . Dr. L. G. Abood , a biochemist who heads the research work at Illinois University 's Neuropsychiatric Institute , has said : " The new drug therapy is not as good as was thought at first . Of course , the drugs have done a lot of good . You do n't see the disturbed patients now that you used to . Instead of being in a locked seclusion room they 're staring at the TV set in a stupor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether it 's really easier on the patients is a doubtful question . Every new therapy produces a sudden improvement in the hospital . EST did , metrazol , insulin , everything . But then it levels  | off . We feel this is happening with the drugs . " Dr. Abood went on : " Today in the rush to find new drugs we 've lost sight of the fact that the real value of Thorazine and Reserpine lies in their experimental value . How are they active ? Where ? . . . You ca n't get around the fact that the real answer lies in understanding the chemistry of the brain . If you make an application for a grant today and say you 're trying out chugs on patients , fine , you 'll get the grant . But all the time , what you should be doing is trying to understand the chemistry of the brain and the chemistry of these drugs . " Dr. Abood said , " All around the country we have good laboratories , but there is n't enough basic work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve , what happens to the energy mechanism ? We 're studying the link between function and chemistry . I think this is where the ultimate secret of life itself lies . " For many years there was a great shortage of doctors , nurses , and attendants to care for tuberculars and epileptics . But suddenly major discoveries were made in how to treat both . And immediately the tuberculosis sanatoriums and epileptic hospitals began to close , and there was a surplus of personnel . Today we have a great shortage of doctors and nurses in mental hospitals . It can only be relieved , in the long run , by some major scientific breakthrough . And increasingly i fyr appears that in this field such a breakthrough depends upon basic research . UNLOCKED WARDS W H A T is the future of the state mental hospital ? " The big state hospitals are bankrupt without exception , " Dr. Harry Solomon of Boston Psychopathic said a while back . " What will come to take its place I do n't know . " Dr. Solomon mentioned certain currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private psychiatrists treating patients in their offices and keeping them out of hospitals ; ( 2 ) more psychiatric pavilions in general hospitals ; ( 3 ) more university hospitals : ( 4 ) the trend toward day hospitals ? patients sleep at home at night but spend their days in the hospital . Hospitals appear to be moving toward greater freedom and closer ties with the community through outpatient and after-care clinics , home-care plans even for acute patients , vocational guidance , halfway houses , day hospitals , night hospitals , unlocked wards , and so on . The community , not the hospital , ought to be the place for preention , pre-hospital treatment , short-term care . The state hospital is the place for patients needing longer treatment . Dr. Henry Brill , of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene , told me on a visit to Rockland State Hospital : " Because of the drugs and other things , these hospitals will change their nature . Their tremendous rate of growth will cease . We 'll come to a stabilized population or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually dissolve . But because of the growing total population , they will be replaced by other elements of the population , other unsolved psychiatric problems . " He did not say so but may have had in mind alcoholics , the aged , and narcotics addicts , among others . " None of this is going to happen tomorrow , " he went on . " In New York we 're still overcrowded , and our admission rates are still going up . But patients stay a shorter period of time . " The drugs had an effect on our building program . In some buildings we built wards for disturbed patients , then the drugs came along . and now we have to take out the inside security screens ? we do n't need ' em any more . There 's been a tremendous and a rapid change . " At the same time that the new drugs , the open hospital , and other innovations have generated a great ferment in the =r4rre of the mentally ill . American medicine has , undertaken a nationwide survey of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landmark in medical history . Such a study was recommended in 195 by Dr. Kenneth E. Appel , then president of the American Psychiatric Association . In January of 1955 under the leadership of Dr. Appel and Dr. Leo Bartemeier , Chairman of the Council on Mental Health of the American Medical Association , the : AMA and the American Psychiatric Association established a joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health . Other national organizations joined . Congress appropriated .51,250,000 for a threeyear study : states and private sources supplied more . The Joint Commission opened an office in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and set to work under the direction of jack Ewalt . Massachusetts Commissioner of Mental Health . It began major studies of various aspects of the care of mental patients and of the manpower available in the mental-health field . It undertook a nation-wide sampling to find out what kind of troubles people have and how they handle them . It began smaller studies of non-psychiatric mental-health resources , such as schools and churches ; of the epidemiology and etiology of  | mental disease , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said : " We 're not trying to paint a picture of the ilverage hospital . We 're trying to pick out the best things and see what makes them the best , so that we can tell a superintendent how to improve his hospital . In general , we 're trying to figure out what should be the future of these mausoleums , the big state hospitals ? trying to figure out where we are now and what we ought to do next . " The Commission will make recommendations to Congress and to the states in the summer or fall of 1959 . Its report may at last provide a rational basis for a national mental-health policy . THE " IDEAL " HOSPITAL A L R E A DAY , in a report for the World Health Organization , more experts on psychiatric care have envisioned an ideal hospital . They decided that most Western countries probably needed at least one bed per thousand population , but in rural tropical Africa a tenth as many was enough . ( Most Western countries now have about three beds per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be to build more beds , as has been ( lone in the past . Rather , as soon as the hospital can provide essential custodial care , its staff members should reach out into the community and devote a third of their time to a community mental-health program . They should inform the public about the hospital and the nature of mental illness . They should encourage private physicians and general hospitals to deal with simple psychiatric conditions and promptly recognize those beyond their scope . They should set up an out-patient service and a day hospital . They should set up special clinics for special problems , such as alcoholics , epileptics , and children . And they should form clubs of patients who have been discharged from the hospital and direct their activities . The experts argued that the amount of money spent does not alone test a hospital 's quality . quality is better measured by the average length of stay , the ratio between the number of patients admitted and discharged , the capacity the hospital has to absorb patients from society and take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return , and , above all , " the atmosphere " of the hospital . On this last intangible point the experts wrote , " Too many psychiatric hospitals give the impression of being an uneasy compromise between a general hospital and a prison . Whereas , in fact , the role they have to play is that of a therapeutic community . " The " atmosphere " of a hospital can be evaluated in numerous ways . How good are the relations between the medical director and the doctors under him , between the doctors and the attendants , between the attendants and the patients , among the patients themselves ? Does the hospital preserve the patient 's individuality ? ( " In too many psychiatric hospitals still the patient is robbed of her personal possessions , her clothes , her name , and ? should her head be lousy ? even her hair . Every step , therefore , that can encourage the patient 's selfrespect and sense of identity should be taken . " ) Does the hospital assume that the patients are trustworthy ? ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removal of knives and other elaborate and insulting precautions have provoked many suicidal attempts . High walls , bars , armor-plated windows , bunches of keys , uniform clothing , and all the other paraphernalia of prison make modern psychiatric treatment impossible . " ) Does the hospital reward patients ' good behavior rather than punish bad ? Is it , for that matter , punitive at all ? Does the hospital encourage patients ' initiative and responsibility ? Does it encourage visitors ? Does life inside the hospital resemble as closely as possible life in the outside community ? ( " In a Western country where men and women mix freely at work and in recreation , it is obviously desirable that they should do so when in the mental hospital . " ) Are the patients active ? not merely busy , but busy at planned and purposeful activity ? Once the proper atmosphere of the therapeutic community has been established , the WHO experts wrote , the staff . can build upon it specific types of treatment . They merely mentioned electroshock ; they emphasized much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds , ranging from habit-training for grossly deteriorated patients to art and music for others . " In their gradual return to social effectiveness , patients often seem to need to recapitulate , not only the development of the interests and ac-  | tivities of the human being from childhood to adult life , but also the development of the human race itself . The group activities must therefore cover the scale from the archaic and primitive to the cultural and technical , " and they pointed out that for some patients " sand and water play ... provides a more therapeutic occupation than any technical or craft activity . " Patients must be given responsibility . During the greater part of the day the patients will be away from their own sleeping quarters . However , patients should not be locked out of their wards any more than into them , for if they need solitude and rest they should have it . There should be one doctor fdr every 150 patients ; one nurse for each five or six patients . More use should be made of group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychotherapy . As for full-scale classical psychoanalysis , it is probably never justified except for research purposes , the experts thought . Each patient , however , should " feel that there is one doctor who is his ? one doctor who knows him well and whom he knows . " When a new patient is admitted " everything " should be done to make him feel at home ? he should be given a guide book and a map and should as a right , meet the medical director personally . Leaving the hospital , he should be prepared by gradual trial visits and numerous interviews and be helped by social workers to find a job and home . The hospital building should not dwarf the individual by its site and by herding patients together in thousands in giant monoblock buildings . No hospital should contain more than a thousand patients . ( The experts doubted that large hospitals are cheap to operate . ) No hospital should be built to last too long : " Many countries will be burdened for a long time to come with large obsolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the mental hospital which is now completely rejected . " New hospitals should be designed to become obsolete in twenty or thirty years , and their interior walls should be movable . The hospital should be composed of several small buildings , not of a single large building . Enormous existing hospitals could be improved by breaking them up administratively into units of 400 to 700 patients , each complete in itself with its own medical director and staff . Finally , the experts warned , the psychiatric wards of general hospitals are not necessarily the best places for psychiatric care . Too often they keep patients in bed and emphasize neurological diagnosis . Sometimes they are also " very detrimental " to the community mental hospital , because they treat and return to society all patients capable of early recovery and send to the community hospital only grossly disturbed or chronic patients . " There is no more certain way of turning the community mental hospital into a madhouse ' and depriving it of its role of a therapeutic community . " A PANE OF GLASS U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of our very best private hospitals as yet approach this ideal Yet these few may point the way to the future . Dr. Brill of New York State believes that in not many years the state hospital as we know it today will be remembered as a curiosity in medicine 's history . And he puts it : " A hundred years ago or more the movement to get the mentally ill into hospitals began . We organized hell out of mental illness ? developed enormous collections of mental patients before we had any effective methods of treatment . That 's how the problem developed that we call the state hospital problem ? not for a lack of finances and personnel , but because we collected all these people ? for the best motives ? before we knew what to do for them . Now at last we do know . I feel that we 're at a new threshold in psychiatry . " Psychiatry can work no miracles . Serious men in the field fear that the hopeful public may vote them all the money they ask but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn on them indignantly , with the result that psychiatry will be set back many years . Hope should not blind us . Despite all advances , so recently as the end of 1957 Dr. William Menninger of Topeka called government-run hospitals a disgrace , " human warehouses . " " Sixty per cent of their population never comes out alive . " Money , personnel , research , and public understanding ? these , he said , are what we need today to make them what they ought to be . A schizophrenic patient , trying to explain his condition , once said , " There is a pane of glass between me and mankind . " All lunatics and their asylums have traditionally been blocked off from the rest of the world by an invisible barrier . The task of psychiatry is to smash the pane of glass . That goal , like man 's ancient dream of reaching the moon , seems less wild a dream than ever before .                   @ @
