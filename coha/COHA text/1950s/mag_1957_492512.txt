Recurring nightmares kept troubling the anesthesiologist of a large hospital . In each dream he saw an unconscious surgical patient being wheeled from the operating floor . On the corridor , in the elevator , back in his room  --  the details varied  --  the patient suddenly stopped breathing . Some nights , so the dream went , his tongue fell back in his throat , choking him . On others he vomited , and drowned in his own gastric juices . Sometimes a blood clot constricted his windpipe . The anesthesiologist found himself frantically pushing buttons for elevators which did not come , then racing to the scene , up three flights or down four . He arrived panting , looked around wildly for equipment to save the patient 's life . But the room was bare . The dream always had the same ending . The doctor broke the news to the patient 's family  --  sometimes to the weeping parents of a little girl , to the son and daughter of a loved old man . " Yes , " he told them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This anesthesiologist shook of his nightmares without the benefit of a psychiatrist 's couch . lie persuaded the administration to install a new kind of room in his hospital  --  a recovery or post-anesthesia room . Now he sleeps peacefully as a babe . The anxiety reflected in this doctor 's dreams has been shared during the past decade by surgeons and anesthesiologists all over the country . They arc convinced that the advent of the recovery room , a new concept in team care for the post-operative patient . closes a dangerous gap which has threatened the safety of modern surgery , " The dcselopmcnt of the recovery room is probably the single greatest advance in the safeguarding of Ihe surgical patient since the discovery of anesthesia , " says Dr. Robert Dripps. chairman of the Anesthesiology , Department of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine . A recovery room is an open ward , usually placed a few doors down from the operating suite , where men , women and children , completely unsegregated , are watched until they regain consciousness and their body functions stabilize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room is staffed by specially trained nurses . Anesthesiologists and surgeons are only seconds away . Multiple equipment is on hand to cope with emergency . During the first hour or two following surgery , more preventable damage can occur than in the operating room itself . This is the twilight time in which the body 's defenses sag after meeting the surgical emergency . Still drugged by anesthesia , the body is robbed of the reflexes  --  swallowing , coughing , gagging  --  which protect it from breathing obstruction . Insidious bleeding may start at the wound site . Blood pressure may plummet downward and irreversible shock set in . Blood clots may form and start their deadly trip to the heart or lungs . Lungs may collapse from excess air or fluid in the chest cavity . Pneumonia may follow the inhalation of bacteria-laden mucus . Under surgery , the patient is the star . Three teams  --  surgeons , anesthetists and nurses  --  bend over him anxiously , noting every twitch , every slight deviation from normal . Then , when he leaves the operating room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost abandoned . Unconscious , he is often escorted only by an untrained attendant . He is jostled through drafty corridors , down dimly lit tunnels , jounced in the elevator . Although motion is a constant hazard , the trip from operating room to bed may stretch three city blocks and take twenty minutes . At his destination he is pushed and hauled from stretcher to bed . There a nurse  --  sometimes a very junior nurse  --  awaits , hoping to give him her full attention . Her orders are precise . The patient must not be left unattended for a second . His vital signs  --  blood pressure , pulse , respiration  --  must be checked at least every fifteen minutes . Hourly , he must be made to breathe deeply and cough . Equipment to guard against breathing obstruction must be at hand . Unfortunately , no matter how conscientious the nurse , these instructions are impossible to carry out . Someone has borrowed part of the equipment . Another patient needs help with his lunch . Visitors arrive and pester with questions . A patient wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for surgery . In 1947 an Anesthesia Study Commission , set up by the Philadelphia County Medical Society , analyzed an eleven-year toll of 306 anesthesia fatalities . Almost half of the deaths were found to be preventable . Respiratory obstruction coupled with inadequate nursing care accounted for ninety-five deaths . Twenty persons died from preventable shock or hemorrhage . " A glaring defect in man-agement  --  was the commission 's comment . Every anesthetist can translate these damning figures into the reality of his own experience . In a Washington , D.C. , hospital a few years ago , an unconscious young woman was left briefly alone , lying on her back , following minor surgery . Her limp tongue dropped back into her throat . When the surgeon entered the room she was dead . Death rode the elevator last year in New York City 's huge Bellevue Hospital . The victim of a hit-and-run driver was being returned to the ward , a cast covering his lower trunk and legs . As the elevator jolted downward , he began to vomit and inhaled the material . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turn him quickly enough . He choked to death . ( Tommy Dorsey , incidentally , died in the same manner last November when , anesthetized by sleeping pills , he regurgitated and breathed food particles into his windpipe . ) If simple suction equipment had been at hand to draw out the material from the Bellevue patient 's windpipe , he would i have lived . Sometimes equipment is available , but no one there who knows how to use it . In another New York hospital , a sixty-year-old man was returned to his room , following thyroid-gland surgery . A resident glanced into the room ( Catriirrued from Mtge ill ) from his mouth . He must be watched constantly . A few beds down , a woman stirs to wakefulness . A nurse moves quietly to her side . " Oh , it hurts , it hurts , " the woman moans . The nurse checks her bandage , then whispers quietly till her patient drops back to sleep . The woman is fearful . but not in pain , and the nurse 's words reassure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiration , have been cut to a minimum in the recovery MORI . A nurse is across the room , her back to a gall-bladder patient , when he stirs , gags and starts to choke . She glides swiftly to his side . reaches to the suction apparatus behind him and inserts it deftly down his throat . As it gurgles , irritating mucus is sucked up . He holds up a weak hand in gratitude . Another nurse examines a teen-age boy who completed heart surgery live hours earlier . He is conscious . " We 're going to sit up now , " the nurse tells him , " and you 're going to take three deep breaths and then cough for me . It will hurt a little , but it will help your lungs to expand . " She lifts him up , and he coughs weakly . The nurse 's routine is busy and usually quite uneventful . Check blood pressure . pulse and respiration every five minutes , later every fifteen minutes . Note them carefully on the chart . Be on guard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may denote impending shock . Watch the bandages carefully for drainage . Even one tiny slipped suture can cause trouble . Glance at the little boy 's neck to detect unusual swallowing motions . A tonsil wound can hemorrhage quietly , with blood dripping unnoticed down the throat . Make sure an unconscious patient is not lying supine , chin on chest , a position dangerously like the coffin . Note the skin . Is it cold and clammy ? Or bluish ? Does the chest rise and fall rhythmically ? Or is there air hunger  --  chest and neck muscles straining ? " The recovery-room nurse , " says the chief anesthesiologist in a leading New York hospital , " lives in the most exciting environment in the entire hospital . Her alertness is the first line of defense in the battle for a human life , Hand-picked for stability and intelligence , she soon develops an almost intuitive smell for danger . A patient 's snort or faint cough is as meaningful to her as an infant 's cry to a mother . " Within seconds the recovery-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the dire emergency of cardiac arrest  --  the moment when a patient 's heart unaccountably stops beating  --  has been mapped and rehearsed . To summon aid , an emergency bell which peals through the operating suite lies behind her desk . Usually five rings mean a cardiac arrest , ? In a large Eastern hospital , a woman aged fifty -- eight was admitted a few months ago to the recovery room . Her surgery had been minor but lengthy , a diagnostic biopsy of the thigh bone . Upon admission , her vital signs were normal . Five minutes later a student nurse moved to her side and adjusted the blood-pressure cuff on her arm . She shook her head and held a sensitive finger to the woman 's wrist . " I ca n't get a blood pressure , " she called to the head nurse . " Will you try ? " Other nurses tensed for action as the head nurse moved swiftly to the woman 's side . She , too , shook her head . Like a well-trained football team , the nurses moved simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency buzzer an urgent live rings ; another to the supply closet for the cardiac-arrest tray ; a third for heart stimulants and an artificial air way . The head nurse remained at the patient 's side . She elevated the foot of the bed and started feeding oxygen by mask . Within thirty seconds an anesthesiologist appeared , a surgeon at his heels . Soon nine surgeons were crowding the doorway . A surgeon took up the scalpel and rib spreader from the sterile tray , while the anesthesiologist , eyes on the sweep hand of the wall clock , called out fifteen-second intervals . The body can live only four minutes without heart action . " Two minutes . " The doctor reached the heart and began gently massaging it . " Two minutes , fifteen seconds . " A nurse wheeled up the electric defibrillator machine , to shock the heart from useless twitching into purposeful beat . " Three minutes , " A second surgeon quietly slipped into place as the first man 's hand tired . Ten minutes later , heart pumping steadily , the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound was closed under sterile conditions . Two weeks later she was discharged , well . Cardiac arrest is far from the only recovery-room emergency in which seconds count . Last year a sixty-three-year-old woman was wheeled into the Hartford Hospital recovery room , following surgical correction of a hernia of the diaphragm . A half hour later X-ray technicians pushed their machine up to her stretcher . X rays are made routinely following chest surgery , to make sure that fluid and air do not accumulate in the chest cavity and collapse the lungs . A technician and a nurse started to lift the patient . She moaned softly and fell back in their arms . The nurse looked at the patient 's face as the automatically reached for the wrist . The face had suddenly become bloated , the skin stretched tautly over swollen checks . She pulled back the sheet . The woman looked pregnant . Her distended abdomen kept growing , like a huge balloon about to burst . With the emergency bell still echoing , Dr. Charles Barbour , staff anesthesiologist , was at the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had no T H E pulse or blood pressure . Doctor Barbour made a swift diagnosis . Somehow , he knew , air was entering the chest cavity , pressing on the lungs . Through a leak in the wound , air was seeping into the abdomen , now hard as a hoard , and coursing up under the skin of the neck and face . Doctor Barbour called for two long hollow needles , deftly inserted one in the abdominal cavity , the other in the left chest . In the quiet room , the air whistled as it escaped . The woman 's cheeks slackened and her stomach slowly relaxed . The emergency had lasted only four minutes . Sometimes the quick action of a nurse is enough to save a life . In a Middle Western hospital a few months ago a fifteenyear-old boy lay in the recovery room , following heart surgery . A narrow tube stretched from an opening in his chest to a large bottle on the floor , partly filled with water . The tube was sucking air and fluid out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water kept air from flowing back and crushing his lungs . The strap to restrain the legs of a restless patient had been removed and thrown over the bottom of the stretcher . Suddenly , in a single violent motion , the boy doubled up his legs . The strap fell , its buckle striking sharply against the heavy bottle on the floor . The bottle broke . Water gushed to the floor . One end of the chest tube was now open , and air was rushing into the chest cavity , where , within minutes , it would flood the area , constricting and collapsing the lungs . At the crack of the breaking bottle , two nurses looked up . One moved swiftly to the youngster 's side . She kinked the tube and held it firmly closed until the other nurse appeared with a new bottle , Then she deftly slipped tube into bottle , resting the end carefully in water . In the minute which had passed , the boy hardly stirred . Not more than one patient in twenty is likely to become delirious while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons are often needed to protect him from injury . Patients have been known to fall out of bed , even when the crib sides are raised , or to thrash so vioSATURDAY EVENING POS , T lently that they overturn is stretcher . Carol Zeidler , the pretty twenty-three-year-old blond nursing supervisor of the New Rochelle , New York , Hospital recovery room , had no warning of such an occurrence when she sent her staff to lunch one quiet day last year . Then one of her two patients , a 200-pound man , reared up in bed , his arms flailing . Carol tried to push him down . For a while there , " She recalls , " we looked like a couple of wrestlers . I was using all the strength in my arms to hold him down , but he was getting too much for me . Luckily , I have long legs  --  I 'm five feet eight . With one leg , I reached out and kicked free the mechanism which locks the stretcher wheels in place . Then , still pushing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the wall where our emergency switch is placed . It 's four feet off the floor , but I gave one mighty kick and my left heel managed to flip it . " The switch flashes a light in the operating-room office and the resident 's room just down the hall . If I had n't been ready to cry from exhaustion , I would have burst out laughing at what streamed through the door . Doctors in every stage of undress , including one who was shirtless , still dripping wet from the shower , pulling on his pants as he ran . Five minutes later , my patient was quiet as a baby . It took me two days to recover . " The recovery room 's value to the modern hospital is so obvious that anesthesiologists today ca n't figure out how they ever survived without one . Actually , until World War H approached , the need was not overwhelming . Surgery was simpler , and fewer people had it . Oxygen , blood and intravenous feeding were not routine . Private patients usually hired round-the-clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war quickened , civilian hospitals began to suffer from a severe shortage of nurses and house doctors . Emergency Hospital in Washington , D.C. , always assigned a nurse to watch each post-operative patient . But one morning in 1942 six operations were scheduled and only a single nurse available . Dr. Donald H. Stubbs , hospital anesthesiologist , ordered a spare room scrubbed , staffed it with his nurse and wheeled in all six patients . During the sante year , recovery rooms were opened at St. Mary 's Hospital in Rochester , Minnesota , staffed by Mayo Clinic doctors , and at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester , New York . At first , they were considered mere stopgaps to ease the nursing shortage . St. Mary 's sent to its recovery room only those patients unable to secure private-d uty nurses . Meanwhile , in the war theaters , surgical cases were pouring into hastily set up field hospitals . Thousand-bed hospitals spread over twenty-five acres , Nissen huts or tents in a straggling row . Obviously , a post-operative patient could not be trundled such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-trained corpsman might be waiting to care for him . Army doctors improvised recovery wards in tents adjacent to the operating area , and trained corpsmen and nurses to staff them . Watching such a recovery room in action , Col. Ralph M. Tovell , senior consultant in anesthesiology for ETO , realized that a complex problem had been inadvertently solved . Concentration of postoperative cases allowed concentration of the equipment they might need . Undue motion was eliminated . Surgical patients were getting more expert care than a private-duty nurse provided at home . Doctor Tovell knew that plans were at-ready drawn for a new building for the Hartford ( Conarthred VI , Page 64 ) // ( Continued frorn Page 62 ) Hospital , where , as a civilian , he had been chief anesthesiologist . Construction was due to start with the war 's end . " You 're got to revise the plans , " he wrote home . " This recovery-ward idea is a must . " When ground was broken ten days after Day for the Hartford Hospital , a recovery room had been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching on slowly . In 1951 an American Hospital Association survey revealed that barely more than one out of ten hospitals had installed recovery rooms . Although anesthesiologists were enthusiastic , hospital administrators scoffed at " expensive luxury . " A recovery room meant space , which usually had to be taken from revenue-producing beds . It meant money  --  a minimum of $4000 and as much as 550,000 . It meant special nurses , with every hospital already seriously understaffed . It meant headaches from the public . Would n't private patients complain about being sent to an open ward ' Would their families wait patiently during the extra hours following surgery ? increasingly , the need was acute . surgory had grown bolder . The scalpel was making daring incursions into the heart , lungs and brain . Routine care of the postoperative patient called for blood , intravenous fluids , oxygen . Resuscitation equipment was multiplying wildly . No hospital could afford to crowd into one private room all the equipment which might be needed to save a life . Instead of improving , the nursing shortage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained years earlier , gave only a delusion of safety . Even when a patient could afford her fees , she was tough to locate . With hospital and surgical insurance spreading , more people were seeking surgery and demanding semiprivate rooms , less accessiblc than the ward to the nurse 's eye . Anesthesiologists schemed and pleaded and hunted desperately for operating floor space . Nurses ' locker rooms , even supply closets were turned into recovery rooms . One doctor persuaded his hospital to combine a secretary 's cubicle , a halfway and an elevator shaft into a recovery area . Another checked nursing duties and announced that the floor nurse 's work would he cut in half if she were freed from care of the postoperative patient . In the past few years recovery-room construction has boomed . By the end of 1955 almost one general hospital out of seer three had built such a room . In the larger hospitals , where the bulk of the na. - t , on 's surgery is performed , the figure is even higher . More than half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals have recovery rooms . Pressure from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals , an influential national organization which passes on hospital standards , is expected to be increasingly persuasive . " In live years ' time , " says Dr. Kenneth B. Babcock , director of the Joint Commission , " we will probably not in good conscience be able to accredit a hospital of more than fifty beds which has an active surgical service and no recovery room . " Slowly the recovery-room concept is expanding to the maternity patient . A recent survey of 300 large hospitals indicates that one out of every ten either has installed an obstetrical recovery room or is planning one . Impressed by the success of team care , a few hospitals have broadened their recovery rooms to include critically ill nonsurgical patients in need of intensive treatment . Dr , Max S. Sadove , chief anesthesiologist at the University of Illinois Research and Educational Hospitals in Chicago , is a leading proponent of the intensive-therapy idea . " The critically ill patient , " Doctor Sadove says , " takes five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average convalescent . It is unfair both to him and to the other patients on the ward to expect a nurse to divide her time between them . " We put poisoning cases , attempted suicides , spinal-cord injuries and acute cardiacs in our recovery room . A patient using an artificial kidney or an iron lung needs more nurses than there are on the average floor . He goes into the intensive-therapy room too . We even take outpatients in need of temporary watching , such as spastic children who have had dental work performed under general anesthesia . One out of every six patients remains more than a day , and some stay a week . When a patient remains overnight in the recovery room , we usually relax our rules and allow a brief visit from his family . " The family of the surgical patient , usually barred from visiting the recovery room , is probably the only loser from this new deal in postoperative care . Contrary to expectations , few beefs are received from patients themselves , even in New York 's Presbyterian Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recovery room with the medically indigent . The waiting families do suffer , especially when communication lines are weak , and their news is sifted through a bored floor nurse , who , in turn , has to telephone the recovery room for her information . Yet complaints are seldom heard from those relatives who have recently had both pre- and post-recovery room experience . One of these , a Chicago man , sat at the bedside of his unconscious brother , following a lung operation several years ago . " My companion , " the man recalls , " was a student nurse . 1 do n't know which of us was more frightened . At the same moment , we both noticed he was having trouble breathing . The nurse ran down the hall for oxygen , and I ran after her . Together we lugged the oxygen tank to his bedside . It was ten minutes before a doctor arrived . " A few months ago we had to rush my eight-year-old daughter to the same hospital for an appendectomy . But what a difference ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and I were jumpy while we waited an extra hour for her to come down . But T knew that if she needed oxygen , it was right by her bed . And a doctor was much closer than ten minutes away . 1 t was a pretty good feeling , "
