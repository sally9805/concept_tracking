In its first year as a sovereign nation and 15th member of the Atlantic alliance , West Germany has turned in a disappointing performance as great partner of the West . Items : <P> A year ago , as part of the bargain that won its sovereignty , West Germany pledged NATO a 500,000-man army of twelve divisions for the common defense . Today it still has only a handful of men ( just under 10,000 ) in uniform , has passed less than half of the enabling legislation for rearmament . And the conscription bill has been so often delayed that final passage is not expected before fall . Though the most prosperous country in Europe , West Germany has refused to contribute more than 5.5% of its swelling gross national product to its own defense . Britain , despite inflationary troubles , contributes 10.1% , the U.S. 11.6% . Despite its failure to build its own army , West Germany , in the person of pfennig-pinching Finance Minister Fritz Schaffer , for months refused flatly to continue its cash contributions to the support of Allied troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms from the U.S. as a gift-but the only comments heard are complaints that the arms are obsolete . Though Germany has accumulated $2.3 billion in gold and dollar reserves , though it has an unused budgetary surplus of $1.4 billion gathering dust in banks , Schaffer is asking the U.S. for $2 billion in defense aid , half as an outright gift . <P> From Bonn TIME 'S Bureau Chief Jim Bell reported : <P> Few Germans seem to care about the posture West Germany thus presents to its allies . Most politicians are interested only in next year 's elections . Businessmen want to hedge against a possible Western recession by opening up trade with the East . Everyone wants big tax reductions . What does seem essential is that production should continue its phenomenal rise , steel output its steady climb ( last year it passed Britain 's ) , exports their swift increase , so that there can be more goods in the stores , more wages in the pay envelopes , more automobiles on the autobahnen ( where there are nearly three times as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The untold story of West Germany 's shortcomings might be called the ordeal of that great old man Konrad Adenauer . Der Alte saw his deepest convictions shaken . Even his closest intimates only partly appreciate how severely that ordeal tried his spirit and paralyzed his decision . Germany has scamped its obligations in almost exactly the degree that his hand has faltered . <P> A year ago Adenauer stood bareheaded in a drizzling rain to watch the flag of the Federal Republic raised for the first time . His nation , a decade before the smoking ruins of Hitler 's Reich , was accepted in the world again , largely because of him . This was his moment of triumph .
