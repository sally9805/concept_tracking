CUBA Stuck in the Mud For five days last week the Cuban government kept officially mum while high-ranking members of the regime leaked to the press that 11,000 army troops , with artillery , mortars and bombing planes , were in an all-out drive to flush Fidel Castro from his mountain fastness in the Sierra Maestra . " This is the real thing , " they said . <P> The clandestine rebel radio seemed to confirm that some hard fighting was in progress , because it appealed : " Come to the Sierra Maestra , Cuban doctors . We need surgeons urgently . The enemy offensive has begun violently along a 200-kilometer front . " <P> On the sixth day of the " offensive , " President Fulgencio Batista 's government finally issued a statement denying that its army was engaged in " fullscale combat " in Oriente- " only small skirmishes , " it said . Other reports indicated that heavy rains and a sea of mud had bogged down the troops and grounded the air force . <P> Outnumbered and outgunned , the rebels maneuvered their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out several surprise assaults on isolated Cuban army patrols , reports said . <P> Talk of a " big drive " involving 11,000 army troops is undoubtedly exaggerated , but there is evidence that Batista is beefing up his operations against the rebels . The army is now establishing fortified posts deep in the Sierra Maestra . Men and arms for these posts are supplied by a new weapon in Batista 's arsenal-British-made , armored helicopters , each reportedly carrying 14 men with full equipment .
