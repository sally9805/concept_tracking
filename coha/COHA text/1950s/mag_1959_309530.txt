From the bench of Georgia 's Fulton County superior court , Judge Durwood T. Pye keeps a hot eye on the Atlanta press . Last November , during a civil hearing , Judge Pye barred news photographers not only from the courthouse but from " adjacent sidewalks and streets " ( TIME , Dec. 1 ) . Last week Atlanta 's two associated papers , the Constitution and the Journal , faced a far stiffer rap from Pye : a $20,000 fine for contempt of court . <P> Judge Pye struck his blow in connection with the trial ( for armed robbery ) of a notorious Georgia felon named Harold James Meriwether . While the jury trial was in progress , both papers ran stories that dipped into Meriwether 's extensive criminal past . This long-accepted U.S. newspaper practice was unacceptable to Judge Pye . He called the stories to the attention of Defense Counsel Frank Hester : " Have you read these accounts ? " <P> Hester : Yes . sir , and we have no objection to them . <P> Pye : Have no objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Pye : No objection to the accounts ? <P> Hester : No , sir , Your Honor . <P> But Lawyer Hester finally got the judge 's drift and moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the stories gave the jury information it should not have had . Judge Pye immediately ordered a mistrial . <P> Dusting off a 66-year-old Georgia Supreme Court opinion ( " No newspaper has a right while a case is under investigation to comment upon its merits , " etc . ) , Judge Pye then held both Atlanta papers in contempt for " interfering with the business of the court . " Said the judge coldly : " The amount of the fine should take into consideration that the offenses were calculated , designed , deliberate and repeated . This corporation i.e. , the papers takes the position that all that which it here did was its absolute right and privilege to do . It has no such right , and it must be taught to the contrary . " <P> The papers refused to learn Judge Pye 's lesson , prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top .
