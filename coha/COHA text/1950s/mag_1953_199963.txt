Among world oilmen , Norwegian-born Torkild ( " Cap " ) Rieber , a hardfisted , hard-swearing ex-sailor , is an operator whose shrewd deals and big projects have made him something of a legend in the industry . It was Rieber who landed the famous Barco concession in Colombia for the Texas Co .. built a mile-high pipeline across the Andes , wangled a half-interest for Texaco in the rich Bahrein fields on the Persian Gulf . After he resigned as Texaco chairman in 1940. he carved a new career for himself as boss of Barber Oil Corp . <P> Last week , at 71 , Cap Rieber had another big deal cooking . Fast-growing Barber Oil had agreed to sell part of its stock ( 125,000 of its 500,000 shares ) in oil-rich American Republics Corp. , which Rieber also runs ( as chairman ) . The buyer : Tennessee Gas Transmission Co. ' s President <P> Gardiner Symonds , 49 , second biggest U.S. gas-pipeline operator by volume . Tennessee Gas is paying $8,000,000 to Barber for stock which it bought for $3,100,000 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contemplated merger of American Republics and Tennessee Gas 's oil-and gas-producing subsidiary , Tennessee Production Co . <P> The proposed wedding would marry two Texas oil and gas properties with big potentials . Tennessee Production already has interests in 509 producing wells on 57,000 acres , and holds 249,000 additional unproved acres . American Republics is owner ( with Houston Oil ) of 800,000 Texas acres which have already yielded rich finds of oil , though development has hardly been started . Moreover , American Republics ' land is also believed to have big gas reserves . Thus the deal would give Symonds an assured source of gas for Tennessee 's pipelines , and assure him Rieber 's master hand in operating , the oil properties . <P> The Old Viking . Cap Rieber came up in the rough &; tumble school of oil where a boss often had to win his arguments with his fists . He quit his native Norway at 15 to go to sea in sailing vessels , got into tankers just as Spindletop and the Auto Age gave the U.S. oil industry its biggest boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , later built up its tanker fleet and ran Texaco 's overseas sales . He became chairman of the board in 1935 arid made deals all over the world to increase Texaco 's own oil production . <P> As World War II began , Cap Rieber managed to get some German-built tankers in exchange for blocked currency . Even though the deal was approved by the warring British ( who thereby chartered two of Texaco 's tankers ) , it set off yelps that he was " pro-Nazi . " Rather than risk hurting the company . Rieber resigned with a sailor 's cheerful certainty that " no matter how fierce a storm may come , it always calms down in the end . " <P> The New Career . The storm calmed after one of the most famed U.S. Jewish families , the Guggenheims , hired him to boss their floundering , money-losing Barber Asphalt Corp . Rieber sold off its uneconomic properties ( including Trinidad 's asphalt lake ) , explored other properties for oil , bought tankers , built the present Barber Oil Corp . Barber stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , now sells for the equivalent of $113.50 ( counting a split ) . On $12.1 million sales last year , Rieber 's managerial sorcery netted $3,200,000 profits after taxes .
