" Mohammed Ali Ag Attaher , a rich and powerful man , engaged me as a servant , " a half-naked African told the French police in Bamako . " At the same time he hired another man and his wife and child . That was a long time ago-about 15 years . I should say . All of us made the holy pilgrimage to Mecca , and there my master sent me to work at the house of Prince Abdullah Feisal . Long months went by and one day I learned that Mohammed Ali had returned to Africa . The prince ordered me to come before him and told me that I was no longer a free man but had been sold as a slave . Several years later , the prince ordered his overseer to sell me in the slave market of Jidda . I was taken there in a truck . I entered a large , obscure hall . There were many men and women gathered there-slaves like myself . I managed to escape . . . Several times I tried to slip aboard boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . Nevertheless , I managed to stow away in a cargo ship and reached the Sudan . I was free . . . <P> " In Arabia I saw many slaves of my race . There are slave markets in all the big towns there . The slave traffic starts at sundown . The big chiefs examine us and select those they want , just like at a camel fair . You can buy a man like me for a pinch of gold . " Ex-Slave Awad El Goud is only one of many French African Moslems who have been kidnaped into slavery as pilgrims to Mecca . Last week his story was told in Paris by Emmanuel La Gravire , Calvinist minister and Assemblyman of the French Union . " In the course of an investigation over the past few months in French West Africa , " said La Gravire , " I have obtained proof that several hundred Negroes have been sent as slaves by African dealers to the Arab states of Yemen and Saudi Arabia . The Arab is a proud man and there are certain domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford it , he wants slaves to do them . " With their new , oil-born wealth , the minister went on , many Arabs can now afford this luxury , and many procurers in the French Sudan , Ubangi-shari . Chad , the Cameroons and some British territories are ready and willing to satisfy their needs on " the ebony market " at prices ranging from $1,150 to a paltry $570 per slave ( women usually sell for slightly more than men ) . La Gravire 's charges and the evidence which supported them have already sparked the French police into an investigation . <P> In 1950 a U.N . Economic and Social Council committee on forced labor sent out a questionnaire urging all member nations to report on the extent of slavery in their territories . Loftily denying the existence of such a horrid thing , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia never answered the questionnaire . Anti-Slaver La Gravire hopes his own nation will put the problem before the U.N . General Assembly .               @ @ @ @ @ @
