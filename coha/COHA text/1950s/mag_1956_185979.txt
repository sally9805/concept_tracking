THREEPENNY NOVEL ( 396 pp. ) - Berfolt Brechf-Grove Press ( $3.75 ; Paperbound , $1.75 ) . <P> This is a corrosively funny novel about business chicanery . Its unlikely author : a Communist with an irrepressible sense of humor . In Threepenny Novel , the late German Playwright and Novelist Bertolt Brecht takes the position that business is crime conducted in an aura of respectability . His book is somehow engaging despite this classic Marxist idea , because of its raffishly vital characters who make all the Cash McCalls in their grey flannel suits seem as sedate , proper and wooden as the paneling of their executive suites . <P> In the markedly different guise of The Threepenny Opera , some of the same characters have long delighted theater audiences . Both the musical play , with a brilliant score by Brecht 's friend Kurt Weill , and Brecht 's novel stem from John Gay 's The Beggar 's Opera ( 1728 ) . The novel was curiously ignored by U.S. reviewers when it appeared in translation in 1938 as A Penny for the Poor , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social-protest patterns of the ' 30s . Social protest the book certainly is , but of an unsparing misanthropy that crosses all class lines . In a dimly lit nether world of total amorality , human sharks snap at and devour each other as instinctively as do their marine cousins on the ocean floor . <P> Shark No. 1 is Mr. MacHeath , legendary killer and gang leader , once popularly known as " The Knife . " At novel 's start , Mac still has his gang , though none but his intimate henchmen know it , and while he carries a swordstick cane , he is prudent enough never to use it . Mac is a progressive crook who has come to see not the error of his ways but his means : " What is a picklock compared to a debenture share ? What is the burgling of a bank compared to the founding of a bank ? What is the murder of a man compared to the employment of a man ? " <P> Crocodile Tears . In his drive toward legalized larceny , Mac founds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut-rate goods to the poor . To supply them , he turns his gang into a kind of quartermaster looting corps which burgles other shops by night . In plots and counterplots of Chaplinesque strategy and Napoleonic execution , Mac reduces his competitors to satraps in his own trade empire and is elected a bank director into the bargain .
