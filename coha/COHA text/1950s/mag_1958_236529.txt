The successful shot of the Explorer satellite got the U.S. into space , but last week was the week that space got down to the U.S. In Congress , in the White House , at the Pentagon , in politics , diplomacy and planning , space lost its otherworldly quality , was folded into the everyday processes of government . <P> President Eisenhower demonstrated his own matter-of-factness with an edict at his 126th press conference : " All of the outer space work done within the Defense Department will be under Secretary McElroy himself . " McElroy put his thumbprint on an advancing age by setting up an Advanced Research Projects Agency , by appointing General Electric Vice President Roy W. Johnson , 52 , to run it ( see Defense ) . Presidential Science Adviser James R. Killian Jr . undertook a classification of ways , means and reasons for space exploration . The armed services and all space dreamers seized the moment to plug for their pet projects ( see cut ) . And the Congress correlated space with politics ; Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee pained Republicans who recognized good politics when they saw it . <P> The U.S. is still many a moon from conquering space or even moving beyond the crawling stage of unmanned satellites . But even the week 's snarls and snaps were comforting sounds because , like the clear call of the Explorer in its ceaseless cruise , they signaled that the nation was at least gearing up for the conquest .
