At 79 , Ira C. Cardiff is boss of the biggest dried apple plant in Washington 's Yakima Valley . A onetime biology professor , he is also a philosopher who corresponded for years with Santayana , and the author of half a dozen books ranging from A Million Years of Human Progress to What Great Men Think of Religion ( he is an atheist ) . But among businessmen of Yakima , Cardiff is best known for his relentless war with inspectors of the federal Food &; Drug Administration . In a series of battles , boasts Cardiff , " I 've licked ' em every time . " <P> Last week , in winning his greatest battle , Apple Seller Cardiff upset the Food &; Drug Administration 's entire applecart .

In effect , the decision , based on " vague " language in the law , wiped away most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ira Cardiff got into the apple business as a Ph.D . from Columbia who went to Washington to run the state 's agricultural testing station .

Cardiff , arguing for more arsenic , led a five-year fight to get the Agriculture Department to relax the regulation , and finally won . Later , in four separate cases , Food &; Drug Administration inspectors seized a shipment of Cardiff apples on the ground that they were contaminated . In each case , Cardiff fought through the courts , and won .

In federal court , he was fined $300 , but won a reversal on appeal . At that , the Food &; Drug Administration took the case to the Supreme Court . <P> Last week , with their powers clipped , food &; drug inspectors were still making the rounds in the food industry , inspecting plants where owners gave them permission ( most food men let them in ) . The Food &; Drug Administration , meanwhile , was getting ready to ask the new Congress for mandatory inspection powers-written this time in language that everyone , including the Supreme Court , would understand .
