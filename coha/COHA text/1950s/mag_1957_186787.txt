Seldom in so short a span do newspapers have to grapple with such complex legal issues as those in the Page One headlines last week . They ranged from the indictment of Russia 's rape of an entire nation to the fine points of Supreme Court concern for the rights of individuals . Abstruse and remote though most of them might be in their philosophical underpinnings , these topics aroused Americans because they converged on the central theme of freedom and justice under law-whether in Japan or Germany , whether for Hungarians or Americans . <P> By far the biggest issue for the press was posed last week by the Supreme Court 's civil rights decisions ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Refueling one of the most perplexing controversies of the decade-individual liberty v. national security-the court 's decisions moved the New York Daily News to suggest congressional impeachment of " one or more of the learned justices , " prompted a jubilant Page One editorial in the Daily Worker , headed " A Milestone for Democracy , " and blew up an eight-column editorial-page headline in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Concern for Leftists . The court virtually invited journalistic fulminations with its Watkins-case decision , curbing the investigatory powers of Congress , and its Smith Act ruling that it is not illegal to advocate overthrow of the U.S. Government as " an abstract principle divorced from any effort to instigate action to that end . " Some of the loudest outcries came from newspapers that had championed McCarthy ; they ranged from the Omaha World-Herald 's gibe that it is now " all right to teach that the White House should be blown up , " to the Cleveland Plain Dealer 's invitation : " Well , comrades , you 've got what you wanted . The Supreme Court has handed it to you on a platter . Come and get us . " <P> The equally conservative Cleveland News , though owned by the Plain Dealer 's publishers , applauded the court 's decisions as upholding " the individual rights on which the American system is based . " The Southern press , already convinced by the desegregation decision that the Supreme Court is heeding social and political expediency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest decision , abounding in comments that amounted to : " We told you so . " <P> Though there were exceptions , that basic piece of political philosophy , the Bill of Rights , was treated with the respectful debate it deserves . Even the Chicago Tribune 's column-long editorial , though characteristically petulant , actually seemed restrained for a subject so close to the Tribune 's prejudices . Many newspapers , such as the Washington Star , as well as Right-Wing Columnist David Lawrence ( TIME , June 3 ) , argued that the Watkins decision has " crippled " congressional investigators ; several editors quarreled with the court 's semantics in the Smith Act decision .
