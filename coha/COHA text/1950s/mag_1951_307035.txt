THE LATER EGO ( 625 pp . ) James Agate - Crown ( $4 ) . <P> <P> In the spring of 1947 , London Drama Critic James Agate found himself in a familiar condition : up to his neck in work , up to his ears in debt . The British revenue office sent him a " curt communication saying that unless I find 940 within a week everything in my flat except the bed I lie on will be taken away . " <P> Agate shrugged and made note of it in Ego-the compendious , perennial diary which would enable him , he hoped , " to take my place beside Pepys . " " Something has always turned up , " he told Ego , " and something will turn up now . " Four days later , a heart attack swept 69-year-old Diarist Agate to that bourne from which no income tax returns . <P> " The English , " he once wrote , " instinctively admire any man who has no talent and is modest about it . " Sure of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) saw no reason to be shy about it ; the English took him on his own bumptious terms . Though no Pepys , he was as much a national institution as the Archbishop of Canterbury 's gaiters . <P> Up from Calico . Eldest son of a Manchester calico merchant , he dutifully sold the " disgusting , smelly stuff " till he was past 40 . After business hours , as drama reviewer for the Manchester Guardian , he soaked up theatrical lore , fashioned a springy , cock-of-the-walk style all his own . With a little prompting from J.A . ( as he often called himself ) , London capitulated , gave him enough critical portfolios for an unofficial ministry-of-arts . Some of his posts : drama critic of the Sunday Times , film critic of the Tatter , book reviewer for the Daily Express , theater commentator for BBC . For a time , he held all four jobs at once . <P> Busy as a beaver , he estimated his peak output at 350,000 words a year , occasionally resolved to ease off . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of 1945 : " To do the work of two men instead of three . " By then , that 13-year labor of self-love had grown to seven volumes ( final total : nine ) . Into it , Agate had poured his " insane desire " for immortality , and a volley of educated banter ranging from Bernhardt to boogie-woogie , censorship to Sartre . <P> Ibsen &; Spam . Like the rest of the series , The Later Ego ( Egos 8 &; 9 ) is larded with letters from friends and fans , old reviews , quotations from favorite authors . But these are only walk-on bits . The leading " character " is still James Agate , and the role he plays with the most zest is **29;13610;TOOLONG . From modern art to modern man , he was convinced that the 20th Century was a dubious conspiracy against good sense , good taste , and good James Agate . Wearing the chips on his shoulders like epaulets , he waged a steady duel with his time . " To be perfectly frank , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry James , see any play later than Ibsen , hear a note of music after Richard Strauss , or look at any canvas after Renoir ... I hold that when Labor rules the world all elegance will vanish and good manners will be a thing of the past . . . The masses ? . . . I should compel them to vote , of course , because of the salutary effect of voting . But I should destroy the votes , not count them . "
