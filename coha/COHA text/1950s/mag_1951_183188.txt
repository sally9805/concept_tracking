Who in ' 52 ? <P> <P> Sir : <P> It is alarming to me , after having carefully followed the Truman-MacArthur affair in TIME , and the reaction in your Letters section , that the most serious implication of this unfortunate episode has been missed . . . <P> Between the Truman muddle and the Republican fuddle , where are we ? Nineteen forty-eight has n't taught the G.O.P. a thing ! I believe it 's time for the Republican Party to clean house , and come up with a new slate ; 1952 is just around the corner . <P> B. G. Hoos <P> Berlin , N.H. <P> <P> Sir : <P> ... I want to vote Republican , but I 'll be damned if I 'll vote for an outfit run by Taft , Wherry , McCarthy , Hickenlooper , Dewey , et al . Let 's hear from Duff , Morse , Warren and other modern Republicans . . . <P> TOM MACHESNEY <P> Chino , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> ... As a delegate to the Republican Washington state conventions of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : the Republican Party , as represented by Taft , Wiley , Smith , Hickenlooper , Cain , McCarthy , Martin , " Bertie " McCormick and Hearst , is on mighty thin ice . The weight of sound logic lies with the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the U.N . and Truman . <P> The very inconsistency of the arguments of these men is demonstrated by their switch from isolationists to war-on-China-now . Six months ago , with Hoover as their spokesman , they said , " Let 's sit it out alone . " Today , with MacArthur as their new spokesman , they say , " Let 's fight it alone . " What a switch ! And Taft leads them all in his absurd contradiction of himself . <P> DAVID H. DEIHL <P> Ventura , Calif . <P> The Picket-Story <P> Sir : <P> Three loud cheers for TIME 'S June 4 article on the 43rd Division at Camp Pickett , Va . My fiance is one of the thousands of draftee replacements in this division , and reading your article was like reading one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorchester , Mass . <P> Sir : <P> A really terrific article ... How can there be spirit in an outfit like this ? Get rid of these officers and send us some men and we 'll show the Pentagon an outfit . . . <P> ( SERVICEMAN 'S NAME WITHHELD ) <P> Camp Pickett , Va . <P> Sir : <P> . . . Camp Pickett should be investigated , as is being done , but the big problem as I see it is General Cramer . . . <P> ( MRS . ) JUNE NEFF <P> Toledo <P> Sir : <P> . . . The situation here has improved . . . to the extent that we feel it our duty to put TIME readers ' minds at ease by informing them we 're all through crying , and if ever needed as a combat division we 'll go and add a few more battle streamers to our already heavily burdened regimental and battalion standards . <P> PFC . ANDREW GAMBARDELLA <P> SGT . ROBERT LARSEN <P> Camp Pickett , Va . <P> More Collective Nouns <P> Sir : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nouns for animals TIME , June 4 : Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 14th-Century romance Sir Nigel speaks of a cete of badgers , a singular of boars , a sounder of swine ( when hunted ) , a nye of pheasants , a badling of ducks , a fall of woodcock , a wisp of snipe . <P> Modern prose might use new collectives for professional people and others . I suggest an ibid of historians , a ponder of scientists , a scathe of bureaucrats . <P> W. W. WOODSIDE <P> Pittsburgh <P> Sir :
