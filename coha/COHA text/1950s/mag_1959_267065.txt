Adam is a wooden-faced , milk-muscled youth , modestly girdled in verdure . Eve is a ravishing brunette , as thickly mantled in leaves as any maple tree . Above their heads , cast in modern Italian , drifts the story of Genesis . <P> This photographic and popularized version of the Scriptures , approved by the Vatican , is outselling in Italy the Holy Bible itself . It appears in La Bibbia ( The Bible ) , a Milanese fumetto magazine , named for the fumetti , or " little puffs of smoke , " in which , as in U.S. cartoon balloons , the dialogue drifts above the heads of the characters . <P> Fumetti magazines rarely pursue such Biblical story lines , but from the strap to the toe of Italy 's boot they are all the rage .

Sex , violence and nudity are fumetti taboos , partly in concession to a Roman Catholic women 's association , which charged in 1951 that the magazines were corrupting Italian youth . Bosoms are thoroughly draped , although now and then a generously endowed film star , like Marisa Allasio , may present problems . <P> Fumetti models are paid an average of $16 to $25 a day , and some of them-Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren , for example-go on to bigger things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film and television celebrities as Mike Buongiorno , Vittorio Gassmann and Marisa del Frate pose willingly for fumetti scripts , draw as much as $20,000 for a single series-which , shot in weeks , will be doled out to an avid public for months .
