txt The White House stood firm today against the restoring of rigid farm price subsidies , which the Administration contends would defeat efforts to aid farmers in this election year . James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary , asserted that President . Eisenhower and the Administration " have not changed their position one iota " on a return to high , rigid price supports , approved early - this morning by the Senate Agriculture Committee . The threat of a Presidential veto was emphasized by Ezra Taft ' Benson , the Secretary of Agriculture . He cited the President 's " repeated warnings against the kind of action " taken by the Senate committee , which also adopted the Administration 's soil bank plan . But , Mr. Benson said , the rigid price supports and other farm law changes voted by . the committee " would largely nullify " the $1,350,000,000 soil bank designed to pay farmers for cutting production . Both Sides Confident " The soil bank would empty our warehouses but 90 per cent of parity price supports would fill them again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill are inconsistent . The Congress must decide which way it , ' wants ' to go ; we can not go both directions at once . " Both sides were confident of victory when the bitter farm fight reaches the Senate floor . Senator Allen J. Mender , Democrat of Louisiana and committee chairman , said he believed debate would start about Feb. 20 . Administration forces predicted a triumph by about the same 49 to 44 Senate vote as in 1954 . Congress then adopted the Administration 's original farm program , including flexible price drops . The House last year approved the restoration of rigid supports . The Senate Agriculture Committee is postponing its consideration of the matter until this session of Congress . The bill as drawn was ordered sent to the Senate on a twelveto-three vote . Some committee members reserved the right to object to sections . The three against reporting the bill were Senator Clinton P. Anderson , Democrat of New Mexico and former Secretary of Agriculture , and Senators Andrew F. Schoeppel of ' Kansas and John J. Williams of Delaware , Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price supports , attacked the measure as " terrible . " He , too , cited the " inconsistency " of a soil bank to reduce farm output and rigid price incentives to induce production . It was learned that during the committee 's fourteen-hour dispute over the bill the Commodity Credit Corporation told mem- bers that it might have to ask for $3,000,000,000 to $5,000,000 , - 000 more price support money under rigid price supports . The bill provides that 90 per cent of parity suports be returned to corn , cotton , wheat , rice and peanuts . These products now are supported , depending upon supply , at between 75 and 90 per cent of parity , a formula designed to balance farm income and expenses . The committee went beyond the restoration of rigid supports , voting a return to " dual parity " or reinstatement of an old formula used in figuring parity . The use of the old formula would increase the level of supports . A new method , effective this year , generally lowers parity . Air for Dairy Farmers The rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality with provision for lower leVe/s on poorer quality wheat . The committee also added special provisions- to benefit dairy producers , by calling for a floor under butter , cheese and dried milk of SO per cent of parity . The present level is 75 per cent . Tha Administration 's two-part Isoil plan was expanded by $175 , - 1000,000 to $750,000,000 . This plan calls for an acreage reserve under which growers of corn , cotton , rice and wheat could receive payments in cash or kind fsor retiring acres . The Senate bill also would permit corn and wheat farmers to take other feed grains . The other part of the soil bank plan would provide a conservation reserve that would apply to all crops . It would be of a long-range nature and would encourage farmers to return their marginal , or poor , land to grasses and other soil-saving practices . The committee retained the Administration 's conservation reserve but set three years as a minimum for contracts with farmers to agree to retire acres and plant them to soil-building grasses , trees or install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum for the contracts from ten to fifteen years ' to provide better insurance for farmers who plant trees .
