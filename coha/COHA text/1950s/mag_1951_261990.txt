Winging homeward from the U.S. , Ecuador 's Galo Plaza stopped off for more state visiting in Mexico and Venezuela . <P> At the Hacienda Pasteje , famed bull-breeding ranch near Mexico City , he spent a memorable Sunday . Years ago , wearing the short Andalusian suit of an aficionado prctico ( practicing fan ) , Plaza had fought bulls as an amateur in Ecuador . Now a non-practicing fan , he sat in a jeep on rolling fields , to watch the artful passes at the young beasts made by his old friend of the cape , Jesus ( " Chucho " ) Solorzano . Leathery Bullfighter Juan Silveti rolled up , slapped the President on the back , roared : " How 's it going , Plaza old boy ? " Plaza grinned . " I have a lot of friends in Mexico , " he beamed , " who are bound to me by the craziness of bullfights . " Later , there was an informal buffet supper , where Ecuador 's President and 600 other guests consumed 15 barbecued lambs , two calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , 14 gallons of mole , six gallons of chili sauce , three barrels of pulque ( Plaza drank two glasses and liked it ) . <P> In Caracas , where he arrived on the eve of Venezuela 's Independence Day , Plaza maintained a more serious mood . He sat for a press conference , and Venezuela 's usually censored press printed his remarks : " Democracy without liberty of the press is impossible . It 's no help to the government to have a press which only praises it . " Then , though Venezuela now lives under a military dictatorship , he said forthrightly that armies should not mix in government : " Anyone who uses the army as an instrument for political aspirations is defeated beforehand . " After this ringing statement , Plaza tactfully decorated the three members of Venezuela 's ruling junta .
