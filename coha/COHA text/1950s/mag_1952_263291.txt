Winston Churchill last week told the world that in his opinion " the prospect of war is remote and receding . Atomic warfare is too horrible for either side to contemplate , reasoned Churchill . " The quarrel might continue for an indefinite period , but after the first month it would be a broken-back war in which no great armies could be moved over long distances . Governments , dependent upon long-distance communications by land , might well find that they had quite soon lost their power to dominate events . " <P> It was not that the Old Warrior believed that the " mortal danger " of Soviet aggression had in any way diminished . Earnestly , he warned " all the nations who would rather die than submit to Communist rule " that " hard sacrifice and constant toil " are still urgently necessary if the free world is to preserve its " right to live . " But Churchill 's warning was less dramatic than his optimistic forecast , and in war-weary Europe , his speech was taken to mean what too many Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax . <P> Relaxation there was-and it was spreading from limb to limb and country to country in Western Europe . The new phrase , Cold Peace ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) - the notion that Europe can trust the Kremlin to live dangerously , but without going to war-is seized upon avidly by Frenchmen seeking new excuses to obstruct German rearmament , by Britons who fear that rearmament is the road to bankruptcy , by Germans anxious to reopen trade between the Ruhr and Russia . French Elder Statesman Edouard Herriot last week thought the time ripe to try to scuttle the European Army ( see below ) . In Britain , Emanuel Shinwell , former Laborite Minister of Defense , cheerfully proposed that Britain 's draft period could be safely relaxed from two years to 18 months . <P> Against this false optimism , the West 's military men tried to set the sobering facts of life , but only managed to sound like anxious schoolmarms trying to restore order after the cry of " School 's Out " has sounded . Replying to Winston Churchill 's toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrim Society , NATO Supreme Commander General Matthew B. Ridgway last week said that the massive Red army could still pluck Europe like an overripe plum . The Cold Peace boys assume that because an equilibrium between East &; West is planned , it is already here . The fact is , said Ridgway , that NATO 's strength in Europe is woefully below " minimum military requirements . " Everybody seemed to assume that of course a SHAPE general had to scold like that .
