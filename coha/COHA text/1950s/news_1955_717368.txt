txt Developments in Argentina are being watched with a mixture of anxiety and hope  --  mostly hope . The fall of General Peron is one of the most important events of contemporary Latin-American history . The echoes are resounding all over the world and doubtless they sound ominous to other dictators from Madrid to Bogota . There was something exceptionally repellent about the regime that Peron had created , and something about the man that made even seasoned diplomats despair of any human or even satisfactory official contact with him . In this respect he was more like Hitler than the man he most admired , Benito Mussolini . This type of man is so destructive that the process of rebuilding afterward is exceptionally difficult . There can be no question that Argentina faces a period of great unrest and profound difficulties . She will need the help of all her neighbors in the hemisphere and perhaps most of all the United States . There is already talk on all sides of a swift recognition of the new provisional Government of Maj. Gen. Eduardo Lonardi , and Uruguay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have risen to the top , apparently out of nowhere , was General Lonardi is an interesting example of the way crises thrust key men to the fore in an advanced society . The new leader was barely known to the public as a consistently anti-Peronist officer who was always in hot water with the regime . However , his fellow-officers knew him well and trusted him . " There is no reason to believe that he will be anything but the head of a temporary junta or group that will pave the way for a popular government . He has a reputation for being a democrat , and he is reported ready to call for national ' elections to be held within six to eight months , or as soon as new electoral rolls can be prepared . One needs patience in times like this , and the Argentines above all will have to exercise it . They united to overthrow Perrin with remarkable discipline . It is already clear that the revolt was long and carefully planned and was so formidable and widespread that even though Peron knew something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are seeing , the vaunted 6,000 , - 000 descantisados of Peron , like Mussolini 's 5,000,000 bayonets , were a bluff . With the police and military against them and ' their flying squads disarmed or dispersed , there is little they can do . There may well be strikes and industrial unrest in the coming weeks , for the workers will be stirred up by the Peronists and the Communists and many of them will fear a return to the old , bad days . It is worth noting that the Reds are lying low . Perlin at one time flirted with them and recently al/owed them to gain strength in the General Confederation of Labor , but they are not a threat today . The one bad possibility in Argentina ? and it seems most unlikely ? is that a new Government will be so Rightist as to be reactionary . Argentina has a built-in bureaucracy which , like the French , goes on forever and which is ultra-conservative and somewhat nationalistic . Big business and banking have similar elements and so have the military and socalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements have been hoping , and with good reason , is that these elements have moved with the times and above all have learned a bitter lesson during the Peronist regime . Every country needs a conservative Right , and it should be politically important in Argentina , for it represents a large sector of the economy and society . However , as Britain is proving , it is possible to have a conservative movement that is entirely democratic . The corrective in Argentina  --  or the counter-balance  --  could be such traditional liberal parties as the Radical and Socialist . The intellectuals and professional classes generally are certainly democratic . The youth of Argentina , led by the university students , who played such a consistently brave role in opposing Perlin , are also democratic . The new Christian Democratic movement , which may well assume political importance now , belongs in the democratic camp . All these forces will be taking shape and coherence in the coming weeks , and the auspices are good . These are great days for Argentina and it is unbelievable that anyone will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
