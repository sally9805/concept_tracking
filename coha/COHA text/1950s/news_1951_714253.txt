txt Letters to The Times ( Rev. ) JOHN HOWE **30;196;TOOLONG GELBER.JOHN E. CARTON.MAX M .... Letters to The Times ' To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The conclusion , of your editorial " Election Aftermath " declares that the elections of Tuesday , encouraging as they were , revealed one great and dangerous weakness : too many Americans refrained from exercising their most important democratic right . Indeed , this is a great and dangerous weakness , and we ought therefore to concern ourselves the more seriously with its causes . Perhaps chief among them is that insidious feeling that must always be most vigilantly attacked in.a growing democracy , that the individual citizen 's vote does n't really count for much . The greater grows our population the more intense this gnawing pain becomes . Over and over again one hears from every quarter , " What difference does it make whether or not I vote ? Who am I among so many ? " Surely , Tuesday 's elections show us all what difference it makes , and who I , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little incident on that day made a profound impression upon me in this regard . In talking on long distance wire to a friend in New York City I asked if he had performed his civic duty in voting . He replied that he and his family had , but added that they really knew scarcely what to do , for " their man " did n't have a chance , and it seemed a fruitless journey to the polls , as though it were effort needlessly wasted . Thus they had gone somewhat reluctantly and gloomily about the performance of this most important democratic right . Before hanging up I upbraided them right smartly for such lack of confidence and for venturing to assume that they stood so alone in their convictions . At 11 o'clock that night the radio brought word of the victory of " their man . " How readily men of good conscience and reasonably clear thinking will be moved to act contrary to the grounds of their convictions ( or what is perhaps worse , not to act at all ) simply because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To so act is often thereby to yield the decision , the choice , to those less interested in the common good and in many cases far less capable of the wise chtice or safe course . It has been well said that all that is necessary to the triumph of evil is that good men should do nothing . Another reason often proffered for the failure to exercise the free man 's right to vote is the old one that by the time one comes to the general election neither , or none , of the candidates represents the voter 's choice of a fit man for the job .. Lesser Offices The answer to this is also to be found in Tuesday 's off-year elections . Because in most areas there were not what many thought very important offices being filled the voters stayed away in droves . Failing thus to express our choice in the lesser offices we thereby rather effectively limit it in reference to the chief offices of the land . For Rudolph Halley is the exception in that this was his first bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high office is by way of the holding of the lesser offices along the way . It is in precisely these lower brackets that we must exercise the greatest care and concern . How many black sheep graze in the " upland pasture " . today , having reached it by slipping almost unnoticed through the neglected gate in the valley below ! Let us take heart in the turn of Tuesday 's events , when men added the strength of many votes to the strength of one to fashion a great victory for decency throughout the land . Let each , in his own community , stand fast for that which he sincerely believes to be right and honorable . Tuesday has taught us what many hoped but dared not believe , that , in the words of the Old Testament leader , " They who be for us are more than they that be against us .

Break in Machine Politics To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken control " in Philadelphia for sixty-seven years until last Tuesday 's Democratic victory . What about the reform administration Of Rudolph Blankenburg , the " Old Dutch Cleanser " ? A Republican in national affairs but enemy of the crooked G. 0 . P. city and state machines , Blankenburg ran for Mayor on an Independent ( Keystone ) ticket in 1911 and , with the help of a few thousand Democratic votes , beat the regular Republican candidate by a hairbreadth . Although a majority of the City Council did remain under control of William S. Vare , the Republican boss , and managed to block many of Blankenburg 's proposed reforms , he was nevertheless able eto accomplish much during his four years in office . He was a vigorous crusader , possessing-7 -- according to the Dictionary of American Biography ? " a ready wit ; a fearless courage , a commanding presence " ; and he should not be soon forgotten .

Second , that some subway map or guide be posted at the entrances on street level . Finally , that a special illumination distinguishable from a distance mark subway entrances . Special lights ex : - ist already along some subway lines and are of some help to locate the station at night , but they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all entrances . Such improvements will not only make up for the kiosk " ornaments " but will be also of great service to visitors as well as to New Yorkers. - MAx M. TAMIR , New York , Nov. 2 , 1951 . College Ruling Approved To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just read your editoriel " Freedom at Ohio State , " in which the writer condemns the college trustees of Ohio State for their ruling that all outside speakers must be " cleared " by the president 's office before they may speak on the campus . The president has stated , according to the writer , that the ruling was made to " prevent the university 's facilitied from being exploited by subversive groups . " It is my belief that the ruling was made in an attempt to stem the Spread , of Communist doctrines on the campus . The writer points out that to date a " radical educator " and a " Quaker pact ; fist " have been barred .

Lesson of the Election Importance Is Stressed of Individual Votes to Our Society Sadowa , who made a famous remark about the Habsburg domains but Palacky . What the Czech patriot had wanted was an Austrian empire in which its own Slavonic peoples would be predominant , and one free from close union with the rest of Germany . That is what he meant when he said that if it did not exist already , in the interests alike of Europe and humanity , it would have to be invented . The Iron Chancellor having dislodged Vienna from primacy in the Germanys could then bring together the two  --  the three  --  Emperors . But after Bismarck had demoted them the Habsburgs preferred a partnership with their Magyar rather than their Slavic subjects . For that policy the Austrian monarchy and Europe would pay dearly .

New York , Oct. 29 , 1951 , Pensioning Patrolmen Objections to Notice of Retirement Provision Explained To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Without wishing to prolong the difference of opinion between THE TIMES and the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association over the moral justification of the thirty-day notice-of-retirement law , which has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court , I do , however , wish to recall a statement I issued before the City Council at the time the bill was first being considered . I said , in part : The proposed pension law has nothing to do with the law on waivers . In fact , the bill does n't even mention the word waivers . If the bill is designed to plug any defect in the waiver law , why is n't the waiver law amended ? Why try to amend the pension law ? Why advocate a plaster cast for your leg when your hair is falling out ' Besides , a policeman can be prosecuted at any time , under civil or criminal law , whether he signs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign a waiver can not absolve a policeman from prosecution if such prosecution is warranted . The bill is not designed to affect only those confronted with a waiver . It is designed to help bust cops for any minor breach of the more than 432 rules and regulations . The bill Would allow any sorehead superior officer to press charges against a man on the eve of his retirement for such misdeeds as reading a newspaper , smoking , overstaying his relief or meal period , or stopping for a cup of coffee during a blizzard or for a glass of water during a heat wave . There is nothing in the bill which says anything about grand jurief or waivers . The bill is unconstitutional and every Councilman knows it . The Court of Appeals ' has ruled in many cases that a pension is not a gift or a reward but , rather , that a pensioh is , in reality , withheld wages , enforced savings , deferred compensation . In other words , instead of paying police an adequate salary , the city chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller wage . These deductions are applied to a retirement allowance toward the day when a man is too old , sick or generally unable to perform this essentially young man 's work .
