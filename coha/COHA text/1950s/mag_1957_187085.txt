Was the bloom off Canada 's durable boom ? Although 6,000,000 Canadians , more than ever before , have jobs , and the gross national product seems sure this year to edge over 1956 's record , some soft spots are appearing in an economy that is closely tied to the U.S. Cautioned the Bank of Nova Scotia : " The upward trend of Canadian business has in recent months been tapering off . " <P> Industrial wages climbed higher month by month , but the cost of living edged up too . The Bureau of Statistics reported last week that prices in August set a new high for the fifth straight month-this one at 122.6 ( 1949 equals 100 ) . <P> Ups &; Downs . Canada 's business and industry made a spotty picture . The big western oil industry throve ; deliveries in June stood 13% above the 1956 rate . Capital investment this year should top 1956 's record $7.9 billion by some 10% , and brisk retail sales proved that consumers still had money and were willing to spend it . But automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canada announced that it would operate only one shift a day during the 1958 model year rather than two . Steel production was a little below last year 's rate , and newsprint manufacturers last week announced plans to cut back .

With their premium dollar Canadians bought more goods abroad than ever before , thus aggravating their chronic trade deficit . <P> Cross Purposes . Unsure of the economic future , the Bank of Canada and the federal government seemed to be working at cross purposes . The bank , striving mightily to control inflation by classical methods , put a squeeze on the money supply that drove the commercial banks ' prime interest rate to 5% ( v. 4% in New York ) . But the newly elected Tory government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million into new residential mortgage loans , hoped that the resulting construction would help keep unemployment next winter from exceeding the postwar high of 400,000 reached in March 1955 . And the government , preparing for an election that may come as early as next spring , readied legislation to provide cash advances to farmers with unsold grain , higher pensions for veterans , widows , and the aged . These measures might help keep the economy bubbling , but would also contribute to the pressure on prices .
