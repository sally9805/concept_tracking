txt North Korean Communists launched a desperate , suicidal predawn attack today in an effort to recapture vital Kimpo Airfield , but were wiped out by United States Marines who had taken the airport only seven hours earlier . Cpl . Julius Proctor of 225 Rochester Avenue , Brooklyn , said that more than two companies of the enemy , making a banzai attack , had revealed their plans by yells and shouts while the marines held fire until the enemy was within gun-butt range . Easy Company even allowed itself to be surrounded before it began firing . The marines were lying flat in their holes and the enemy was silhouetted against the sky . " It was just murder , " said Staff Sgt. Robert Joiner of Avon Park , Fla . The attack was fully broken by dawn , with most of the enemy lying dead on the airstrip and others in full retreat , pursued by marines and under artillery and air bombardment . By mid-morning the Americans had counted 100 dead , and many others in the area near the airfield had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy thrust were two killed and fifteen wounded , according to Lieut . David Walsh of Lawrence , Mass . The marines captured twelve enemy soldiers who told . questioners that troops in the Inchon-Seoul area were short of ammunition . They said that enemy morale was very low . Thus the marines . stood off the first enemy effort to regain the finest airfield . in Korea , which has a 5,700-foot concrete runway in first class condition . For the Americans who have been fighting the tough North Korean enemy in the south , one of the most amazing things about the marine breakout from Inchon is that the enemy is not using artillery or mortars . He has used perhaps a score of tanks in driblets against the Allied troops but they have all been knocked out easily , many before they had fired a shot . it may be that the enemy committed everything he had in the drive for Taegu and Pusan , and simply does not have the stuff here to stop the marines and attached South Korean units . Although the Allies now hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is not possible to use the field operationally because the enemy still holds high ground on both sides of the Han River from which he could utilize artillery against Allied aircraft . The honor of making the first liberation landing at Kimpo went to a marine helicopter carrying Lieut . Gen. Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr. , commanding the United States Fleet Marine Force in the Pacific , and Lieut . Gen. Frank E. Lowe ; who is President Truman 's personal representative in Korea ; General Shepherd , who commanded the Tenth Army in Okinawa after the death of Lieut . Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr . and is the only Marine to command an Army , and General Lowe immediately spotted a smashed Yak airplane beside the strip . They walked over to it . - Pointing at the plane 's insignia , General Shepherd asked : " Is that the Red Star of Rus- ' sia ? " " Well , we know where the damn thing Was made , " General Lowe replied . Iiimpo a " Glittering Prize " Kimpo is a glittering United States prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a look was Maj. Gen. James M. Gavin , former commander of the Eightysecond Airborne Division , who marched with a front-line rifle company of another Marine regiment yesterday . General Gavin came over to check on the close air support given to Marine ground troops by carrier-based Marine and Naval fighters and bombers . Elements of the First Marine Division , - who , with attached . South Korean units , have done all the fighting thus fat , got the promise of powerful assistance Monday morning* when elements of the Army 's Seventh Division landed and marched toward the front . As another comparison with the southern fighting , there is much more movement in the Inchon area on foot than there is by vehicle . One of the most important economic advantages accruing from this invasion manifested itself today when the first rice was seen being harvested in the fertile plain ringed by the mountains between Inchon and Seoul . At least this much rice was being denied to the enemy and was being gained the civilians . If enemy resistan breaks up as quickly as mai American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few wee ago , may be averted .
