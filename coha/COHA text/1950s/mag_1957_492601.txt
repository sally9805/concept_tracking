There is no explaining it , but the fact remains that in my youth I had a peculiar affinity for pets of the more unusual varieties . It was not that I went out of my way to find them either . They simply fell into my sphere of life as if dropped upon me by some malicious fate . This , at any rate , was what my parents believed , and this was how they explained my acquisition of a brace of rattlesnakes when I was twelve years old . They recognized the same malignant fate when , later on , I acquired a full-powered skunk , a mange-afflicted coyote , a parasitic jaeger from the arctic tundra , and a covey  --  or bevy  --  of fourteen hoary bats . When the owls arrived , my parents were at first inclined to believe that the curse was broken , and they welcomed the new members of our household almost with affection , for owls were , so my parents thought , inactive , dignified and not very stimulating beasts . My parents were wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of 1932 , at Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , were probably the most unusual pets I ever had . In those days I was an avid bird watcher and photographer , and it happened that in the early spring of the year I located a great horned owls ' nest in a poplar bluff not far from the city . The discovery presented me with an unparalleled opportunity to secure rare photographs , and so I constructed a blind , or hide , in the tops of some poplars near the nest . The blind was simply a platform of poles , insecurely tied with binder twine and covered with a piece of canvas . The parent owls did not immediately appreciate a new neighbor , and they impressed me with the weight of their displeasure by tearing the canvas into fine shreds one dark night . But in due course of time a truce was reached . I spent many hours in the blind , and even managed to obtain a few passable photographs . Then that strange fate of mine stepped in . Some youths armed with .22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after I had left . they murdered the adult owls . When I returned the following morning I was greeted by the hungry screams of the two fledglings which had survived the massacre , and , since I felt myself indirectly responsible for their parents ' death , there was nothing for it but to wrap the owlets in my shirt and bring them home . They were then only six weeks old , but already giving promise that their ultimate size would be impressive . My parents , who had never seen a full-grown horned owl , had no real idea as to just how impressive they could be , and I preserved a discreet silence on the subject . Nevertheless , mother vetoed my plan for keeping the two newest and youngest members of the family in my bedroom , even though I pointed out to her that the birds might get lost , and , in any case , they would be in considerable danger from the local cats and dogs if they were kept outside . Mother looked speculatively at the talons which the unhappy fledglings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch in length  --  and gave it as her considered opinion that the cats and dogs would have a thin time of it in a mix-up with the owls . As to their getting lost  --  my mother was always an optimist . Eventually my father solved the housing problem by helping me build a large chicken-wire enclosure in the back yard . This enclosure was used only a few months , for it soon became superfluous . In the first place , the owls showed no disposition to stray from their new home . Each day I would take them out for a romp on the lawn and , Far from attempting to return to their wild haunts , they betrayed an overwhelming anxiety to avoid the uncertainties of freedom at any cost . Once or twice I accidentally left them alone in the yard , and they , concluding that they had been abandoned , staged a ( Continued on Page 134 ) Pals of My Childhood determined retreat into the house itself . Screen doors were no barriers to them , for the copper mesh melted under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tissue paper , Both owls would then come bursting through the shattered screen into the kitchen , breathing hard and looking apprehensively over their shoulders at the wide outer world where their unwanted freedom lay . Consequently the hack-yard cage became not so much a means of keeping the owls with us as a means of keeping them from being too closely with us . The two fledglings were utterly unlike in character . Wol , the dominant member of the pair , was a calmly arrogant extrovert who knew that he was the world 's equal . Weeps , on the other hand , was a nervous , inconsequential bird of an unsettled disposition , and plagued by nebulous fears . Weeps was a true neurotic , and though his brother learned to be housebroken in a matter of a few weeks , Weeps never could really be trusted on the furniture and rugs . When they were three months old and nearly full grown  --  although tufts of baby down still adhered to their feathers  --  Wol effectively confirmed mother 's first impression as to his ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost two feet high . His wingspread was in the neighborhood of four feet . His talons were an inch in length and needle-sharp , and , combined with his hooked beak , they gave him a really formidable armament . One summer night he was in a huff as a result of a disagreement he had had with our dog , Mutt . When darkness fell he refused to come down from a high perch in a poplar tree in order to go to bed in the safe refuge of the cage . Since there was nothing We could do to persuade him , we finally left him in his tree and went to bed ourselves . Knowing something of the ferocity of the night-stalking cats of Saskatoon , I was uneasy for him , and I slept lightly , with one ear cocked . It was just breaking dawn when I heard the sound of a muffled Hurry in the back yard . I leaped from my bed , grabbed my air rifle and rushed out of the front door . To my honor , there was no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst , I raced around the corner of the house , my bare feet slipping in the dew-wet grass . Wol was sitting quietly on the back steps , his body hunched up in an attitude of somnolent comfort . The scene could hardly have been more peaceful . It was not until I came close , and had begun to remonstrate with him for the chances he had taken , that I saw the cat . Wol was sitting on it . His feathers were fluffed out in the manner of sleeping birds so that only the cat 's head and tail were visible . Nevertheless I saw enough to realize that the eat was beyond mortal aid . Wol protested when I lifted him clear of his victim . 1 think he had been enjoying the warmth of his footrest , for the cat had been dead only a few moments . took it quickly to the foot of the garden and buried it circumspectly , for I recognized it as the big ginger torn from two doors down the street . It had long been the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its owner was a big man with a loud and raucous voice who did not like small boys . The ginger torn was the first but not the last feline to fall into fatal error about Wol . In time the secret cemetery at the ( Continued from Page 36 ) bottom of the garden became crowded with the remains of cats that had assumed that Wol was just another kind of chicken , and therefore easy meat . Nor were dogs much more of a problem to the owls . Rather grudgingly , for he was jealous of them , Mutt undertook to protect them from others of his own race . Several times he saved Weeps from a mauling , but Wol did not really need his protection . One evening a German shepherd  --  a cocksure bully if ever there was one  --  that lived not far from our house caught Wol on the ground and went for him with murder in his eve . It was a surprisingly one-sided battle . Wol lost a handful of feathers , but the dog went under the care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the street to avoid passing too close to our house  --  and to Wol . Despite his formidable fighting abilities , Wol was seldom the aggressor . Those other beasts which , like man , have developed the unnatural blood lusts that go with civilization , would have found Wol 's restraint rather baffling , for he used his powerful weapons only to protect himself or to fill his belly , and never simply for the joy of killing . There was no moral or ethical philosophy behind his restraint ; there was only the indisputable fact that killing , for its own sake , gave him no pleasure . Although perhaps if he and his descendants had lived long enough in human company , he might have become , in reality , as sanguinary and as cruel as we conceive all other carnivores , except ourselves , to be . Feeding the owls was not much of a problem . Weeps ate anything that was set before him , on the theory , apparently , that each meal was his last . The future always looked black to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , was more demanding . Hard-boiled eggs , hamburger , cold roast beef and fig cookies were his chosen articles of diet . Occasionally he would deign to tear apart a gopher that one of the neighborhood boys had snared on the prairie beyond the city , but , on the whole , he did not relish wild game  --  with one notable exception . It has been said , and publicly , by scientists who should know better , that the skunk has no natural enemies , It is just this sort of smug generalization that gives scientists a bad name . Skunks have one enemy in nature  --  a voracious and implacable enemy  --  the great horned owl . There can be few animal feuds as relentless as the one which has raged between horned owls and skunks for uncounted aeons . I have no idea how it started , but I know quite a lot about the tenacity with which it is still pursued . The faintest whiff of skunk on a belated evening breeze could transform the usually calm and benign Wol into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the Saskatchewan River , and there was a belt of underbrush along the shore which provided an ideal highway for wandering skunks . Occasionally one of these striped atrocities would forgo the riverbank and do his arrogant promenading on the sidewalk in front of our house . The first time this happened was in the late summer of Wol 's first year . The skunk , cocksure and smug , as are all the members of his benighted species , came down the sidewalk just as dusk was falling . Some children who were playing under the poplar trees fled the approaching outcast , as did an elderly woman who was airing her Pekingese . Swollen with his own foolish pride , the skunk strutted on until ! legume beneath the overhanging branches in front of the Mowat home . Our windows were open and we were just finishing a late dinner . There was not much breeze , and by the time the lirst acrid warning came wafting into the dining room , Wol was ready to make his entrance too , He came through the open window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside my chair , depositing u defunct skunk upon the carpet at his feet . " Hoo-hoohoohoo-1-100 ! " he said proudly . Which , being translated , probably meant , " Mind if I join you ? I 've brought my own lunch . " We never fully cured him of his vendetta against skunks . But it did not bother us as much as it might have done some families , for we were already cursed with a dog that was a skunkaphobe and , over the long and pungent years , we had become resigned , if not accustomed , to the almost perpetual aura of wood kitty in and about our home . Owls are not widely renowned for their sense of humor , and Wol may have been an exception , but he , at least , possessed an almost satanic fondness for practical jokes , of which poor Mutt was usually the victim . He would steal Mutt 's bones and cache them in the crotch of a tree trunk just far enough above the ground to be beyond Mutt 's reach . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer bluff , force the hungry and unhappy dog away from the dish , and keep him away until finally the game palled . Wol never actually ate Mutt 's food . That would have been beneath him . His favorite joke , though was the tail squeeze , During the se-acing heat of the summer afternoons Mutt would try to snooze the blistering hours away in a little hollow which he had excavated beneath the hedge on our front lawn . However , before withdrawing to this sanctuary he would make a careful cast about the grounds until he had located Wol , and had assured himself that the owl was either asleep or at least deep in meditation . Only then would Mutt retire to his cool repose and dare to close his eyes . Despise a hundred bitter demonstrations of the truth . Mutt never understood that Wol seldom if ever slept . Sometimes the owl 's great yellow orbs would indeed be hooded , but even then  --  though he might appear to be as insensible as a graven bird  --  he retained a delicate awareness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so phenomenally acute as to discredit completely the old canard that owls are blind in daylight . Often I have seen him start from what appeared to be a profound trance , if not a slumber and , half turning his head , stare full into the blaze of the noonday sky while crouching down upon his roost in an attitude of taut belligerence . Following the direction of his intent gaze with my unaided eyes . I could seldom find anything threatening in the white sky , but when I brought my field glasses into play they would invariably reveal a soaring hawk or eagle so high above us that even through the glasses it seemed to be no bigger than a mote of dust . In any event , Mutt 's suspicious reconnoitering before he gave himself up to sleep was usually ineffective and , worse than that , it frequently served to alert Wol to the fact that his favorite quarry would soon be vulnerable . Wol was a bird of immense patience . He would sometimes wait half an hour after Mutt had slunk away to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutt on foot , as if disdaining the advantage given to him by his powers of flight . Infinitely slowly , and with the grave solemnity of a mourner at a funeral , he would inch his way across the lawn , If Mutt stirred in his sleep , Wol would freeze and remain motionless for long minutes , his gaze fixed and unblinking on his ultimate objective  --  Mutt 's long and silken tail . Sometimes it took him an hour to reach his goal , But at last he would arrive within range , and then , with ponderous deliberation , he would raise one foot and poise it  --  as if fully to savor the delicious moment  --  directly over Niutes proud plume . Then , suddenly , the outspread talons would drop , and clutch Invariably Mutt woke screaming . Leaping frantically to his feet , he would spin around . intent to punish his tormentor  --  and would find him not . From the branch of a poplar tree well above his head would cone a sonorous and insulting " Hoo-1100-hoo-hoof " which , I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . It seemed to be inevitable that any animal which we took into our family would soon cease to consider itself anything less than human , and it was so with Wol . Very early in life he took note of the fact that we others could not , or would not , fly , and he thereupon accepted a terrestrial way of life for which he was but poorly adapted . When I visited the little corner store , some three blocks from home , Wol would usually accompany me. and he would walk . Strangers who did not know him  --  and there were few such mortals in Saskatoon  --  were apt to be severely startled when they encountered him during one of these promenades , for he walked with a lumbering , rolling gait that smacked of a lifetime of alcoholism . Furthermore , he gave ground to no man . If a pedestrian bound upstream happened upon Wol going downstream , the pedestrian either moved aside or there was a collision . These collisions were not to be taken lightly . I recall all too vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perusal of the unfamiliar addresses on a bundle of letters , walked full into Wol one summer morning . The man was so completely preoccupied with his own problems that he did not even bother to glance down to ascertain the nature of the obstruction in his path , but blindly tried to kick it to one side . This , to Wol , was tantamount to deliberate assault . He rose on his dignity  --  which was immense  --  uttered a piercing hiss and banged the offending human on the shins with his mighty wings . Nor was this a gentle form of retaliation , for the power of Wol 's wing was roughly equivalent to that of a medieval battering ram . There was a sharp crack . The postman yelped in sudden pain ; peered down at his feet ; yelled even louder  --  this time on a high , keening note  --  and promptly fled the neighborhood . It was left for me to collect the scattered letters and to pursue him with what 1 hoped were appropriate apologies . Wien school began again that fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular with Wol . My school was on the opposite side of the river , a good three miles from home , and I reached it by bicycling over the 25th Street Bridge . When I began going to classes in September the owls were indignant , for they , who had been my constant companions all that summer , were now left alone . They did not readily accept this new state of affairs and , during the first week of the term , 1 was late on three successive days as a result of having to conduct my tenacious pair of avian followers back home . On the fourth morning I grew desperate and tried locking them in the big outdoor pen  --  which they had long since ceased to use . Wol was infuriated by this treatment and he tore into the chicken-wire barrier with angry talons . I sneaked hurriedly away , but before I was halfway across the bridge a startled shout from a pedestrian and the scream of brakes from a passing car alerted me to some unusual happenstance . I had barely time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air , a deep-throated and victorious " 1-foo-H00 ! " and two sets of talons settled themselves securely on my shoulder . Wol was breathless from the unaccustomed business of Hying , but he was triumphant . It was by then too late to take him home again , so I went resignedly on my way to school . I left him in the yard , perched on the handlebars of my bicycle and insecurely tied with binder twine , My third class that morning happened to be French . The teacherwas a desiccated female whose spiritual home may have been Paris , but who had never actually been farther east than Winnipeg . She was grotesquely affected , humorless and a tyrant . None of us liked her . Yet I actually felt sorry for her when , in the midst of the declination of an irregular verb , Wol whumped moodily in through the second-story window and slid to an unsatisfactory halt upon the top of her hardwood desk . The exclamation with which she greeted him was given in very old Anglo-Saxon , without even a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal after this incident , but he was a reasonable man , and the upshot was that I escaped corporal punishment on the understanding that my owl would stay at home in future . I achieved this end , but only at the cost of giving the owls the free run of our house . Some ten minutes before I was due to leave for school 1 would invite Weeps and Wol into the kitchen , where they were allowed to finish off the bacon rinds left from our breakfast . Apparently Wol accepted this as a sufficient bribe , for he made no further effort to follow me to school ; and Weeps , who always accepted Wol 's lead , gave me no more trouble either . Mother , on the other hand , was not best pleased by these arrangements . Although the majority of the human residents of Saskatoon knew about , and were inured to , our owls , there were at least two occasions when Wol and Weeps were the unwitting cause of some alarm and despondency to members of the human species . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north of Saskatoon . It was in August , and my parents had decided that we should spend a weekend at Emma Lake , a resort area far to the north . We loaded our camping gear aboard Eardlie  --  our Model A convertible  --  and the six of us  --  mother , father , myself , Mutt and the two owls set out . Having ridden in the car on several previous occasions , the owls had developed a preference in the matter of seating arrangements . Their chosen roost was the back of the rumble seat , where they were exposed to the full force of the slipstream . They loved it , for it offered them the same exhilarating thrill that all small boys experience when they thrust a hand out of a car window and let the wind act on it as it does upon the wing of an aircraft . My owls exploited this adventure to the utmost limit . As soon as the car was in motion they would extend their great pinions as if in flight . If they then slanted the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a squatting position . But when they tipped the leading edges upward they would be lifted clean off the seat , and only the grip of their talons would keep them from soaring aloft like kites . There was not sufficient room to allow both of them to bob up and down together , so they learned to alternate . While one was going down , the other would be coming up in rhythmic frequency . Intoxicated by the rush of air , they would often break into song and my father , caught up in the spirit of the thing , would punctuate their excited hootings with blasts on Eardlies horn . Mutt also rode in the rumble seat , but he was too dignified a beast to take part in these unseemly proceedings . Mutt had delicate eyes , and in order to protect them from the inevitable prairie dust , my father had fitted him with a pair of motorcycle goggles . Thus the complete picture of Eardlie on the highways included a vignette of Mutt sitting stolidly between two active owls , and staring straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation . At the time , I never considered the effect that this visitation must have had upon the drivers of farm wagons whom we passed , and upon the drivers of other cars who passed us . But I have since had many penitential thoughts about the matter . ( Conr railed on Page 138 ) 138 ( Conti/Ian/from Pow / , . #151 On the day we started north the sky was threatening , and we had gone only fifty or sixty miles when a thin drizzle began to beat upon the S Ind screen . The drizzle quickly thickened , and we halted to erect the canvas hood over the front seat . By the time we linished , the ram had become a downpour , and when we drove off again the rumble seat and its occupants were receiving it mighty scourging from the storm . Mutt wisely hunched himself down into the scat %self where he was less exposed to the fury of ss ind and water , but the owls refused to abandon their exposed perch . They even seemed to he enjoying the pelting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies and their great wings Nacre sodden and drooping . Eardlie was the one that really suffered from the deluge , and he began to cough and sputter alarmingly just as we entered one of those two-elevator , one-store , one-garage villages which sprout like toadstools on the western plains . The garage in this particular village was a scrofulous frame shanty with a single antiquated gasoline pump in front of it . A black doorway gaped in the fa  --  ade and , presuming that this led to the workshop , my father wheeled Eardlie through the thickening gumbo of the street and straight into the interior of the building . The garage was dark and gloomy . A single meager light bulb glowed dismally high up amongst the rafters . and by its wan and pallid rays we could barely distinguish the clutter of old tractor parts and rusted scrap that almost filled the place . The proprietor was not immediately in evidence , and we were about to dismount and go searching for him when my eye was caught by movement near Eardlie 's rear right fender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding over an old inner tube , He had a tire iron in his hand and he seemed quite oblivious of our presence . We waited with what patience we could muster until he finished communing with the tube and , very slowly , began to straighten his back and stand up to our level . His face came slowly into my view about three feet away from the rumble seat . 1 can see that face as clearly now as I saw it then . It was pallid . deeply lined and petulant , and smeared with grease that had stiffened a week-old beard , It was wearing a look of querulous animosity , but this began to change as the eyes slowly focused themselves on the car and its passengers . The pallidity of the face was suddenly accentuated in a startling manner . The jaws began to move as they might in a ruminant  --  though they were chewing on nothing more substantial than empty air . It was then that Wol chose to shake himself . He spread his wings to their full extent , gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake transformed him , increasing his apparent size about threefold as his wet feathers came unstuck . Even I found the transition startling enough , but when he concluded the performance by loudly clacking his great beak , by Hipping the membranes sickeningly over his yellow eyes . and by giving throaty voice to his relief , the effect was devastating . The garageman 's face indicated that at least he found it so . The tempo of his jaws speeded up and his face registered a look of fearful and then desperate incomprehension . Perhaps Mutt was as curious as were the rest of us , for at this moment he chose to thrust his goggled head over the edge of the car for a closer look , peering in his shortsighted manner into the garageman 's face . The man had had enough . He moaned low in his throat , threw the tire iron recklessly over his shoulder , but did not stay to hear the crash of broken glass as the sole window shattered . He was gone by then , running down the muddy street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain beating into his face . " Oh , Jesu l " he was crying . " Oh , Sweet Jest ! ! I never done it . that I 'll swear ! " Mother was shocked . She felt that this was a foolish and sacrilegious thing to say . But how could she know ? f have often speculated since on the nature of that man 's hidden crime , for there must have been small enough scope for sin in that desolate and meager little village . More than a year elapsed . and Wot had become a full-fledged member of the family , before he struck once more at human sanity . He had , by this time , become a house owl , making almost as much use of the house as we did ourselves . It was useless to try to deny him house privileges , for he had learned that when he came and banged on the windowpanes with his horny beak , we would hasten to admit him before the glass gave way . During the warm seasons we resigned ourselves to leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this portal he would come and go as the mood was on him . In the summer of Wol 's second year , Saskatoon was enriched by the arrival of a young curate who had just graduated from a famous divinity school in the East . The curate was of an earnest persuasion and he made it his first duty to pay a call on each and every one of the members of our parish  --  to which he was attached . It was a warm and balmy summer afternoon when he reached our house on Crescent Avenue . He rang our doorbell , and mother was pleased to welcome him , for he was a well-favored youth . He had the high-domed forehead that is so often the mark of the stage cleric , but the hair above it was black and curly and in virile contradiction to the cloth he wore . Mother invited him into the living room for a chat and a cup of tea . The young man made himself discreetly comfortable on our chesterfield , a massive and antique piece of furniture which was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its back on the open window sonic six feet behind it . Balancing a cup gracefully in his hand , the young divine engaged mother in conversation , the burden of which was concerned with my own lamentable absences from Sunday school . Wol had been spending that afternoon ant bathing . This was a peculiar pastime in which he sometimes engaged , and which consisted of caring an anthill apart and then fluffing the mixture of dust and angry ants through his feathers . He seemed to find the sensation gratifying . although its purpose seemed inscrutable to us . At any rate , he finished his bath about four P.M. and , feeling in an amiable mood , decided to come into the house and tell mother about it . To this day , my mother swears she did not see him in sufficient time to warn her visitor . I believe that she sass him well enough , but was just too petrified to open her mouth . It is certain , in any case , that the curate had no immediate warning , and it is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our owls during the brief time he 1-md been in Saskatoon . It followed , then , Clot he must also have been unaware that Wol , in his maturity , had become a sentimental bird possessed of the endearing habit of leaping lightly to one 's shoulder , there to balance himself while he tenderly nibbled the nearest human car with his great beak , breathing harshly but affectionately into the face of his companion the while . Everyone who was acquainted with Wol knew of this habit , and some deplored it , for Wol was a carnivore and , as a result , he had the most atrocious breath , The flight of an owl is noiseless ; there is no warning rustle of pinions . Wol 's arrival on the window sill was as silent as the arrival of a putt of thistledown . He paused a moment in the opening and then , spying a pair of tempting shoulders on the chesterfield , he forthwith launched himself across the narrow intervening space . The object of his amiable attention shot straightway into the air and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , for Wol lost his balance and his talons tightened convulsively . The curate now demonstrated that he was both an athletic and a vocal youth . He howled and his bouncing became even wilder . Wol. clinging for dear life , and deeply disturbed by this rude reception , tightened his grip once more , and then  --  and it happened only because of his surprise and indignation  --  he forgot for the first and last time in his mature life that he was housebroken . I do not recall any single catastrophe amongst the many which beset my family through the years , that caused us quite as much embarrassment as this one . Mother , who was a pillar of the church , suffered more than the rest of us , but my father and I were not exempt . I can but hope that the church officials duly noticed how well filled the Mowat collection envelopes were on succeeding Sundays . 1 hope , too , that the elders of the church had the common decency to reimburse their new curate for dry-cleaning expenses incurred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stories of my Family , and of Wol and Weeps , that I have so far related are no more than vignettes of a relationship which , on the whole , was a warm and rewarding one . Even my mother , who had less reason than the rest of us for such an attitude , was singularly fond of Wol , and she forgave him almost everything during the three years he was with us . Though our owls were often under foot , both actually and figuratively , we would not willingly have eschewed the chance to live with them . But as it mast be with the tales of most wild things which have been taken from the wilderness , the final fate of the two owls was a tragic one . When we left the West permanently in 1935 , it proved impossible to take them with us ; and so we reluctantly made arrangements with an acquaintance who owned a farm sonic 200 miles from Saskatoon to care for our old friends , It was , of course , out of the question to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the outer world as new-born owlets . For almost a year we had good reports of both our birds , but then poor , ineffectual Weeps somehow managed to strangle himself in the wire netting of his cage . Only a few weeks later Wol tore the mesh apart and vanished . I wish that he had vanished permanently . Before we left the West I had tagged both owls with marked and numbered aluminum bands supplied by the United States Biological Survey , One day I received a letter from the Survey informing me that a great horned owl , banded by me in Saskatoon in the spring of the year 1935 , had been shot and killed in that same city in April of 1939 . The address of the man who killed the owl , and who returned the band to Washington , was given . It was the address of the house on Crescent Avenue where we had once lived with Wol and Weeps . And so , in the end , Wol went back to that home which he had known so well . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet he succeeded . 1 can guess at his thoughts as he landed in the familiar old poplars and then dropped contentedly down to light upon the window sill , and to rap imperatively upon the glass with his great beak .. ..
