All sorts of gadgets have been developed to help the blind to " see " by sound or touch , but none has come into widespread use . They are generally too complicated , heavy , expensive or conspicuous . Dunn Engineering Associates , Inc. of Cambridge , Mass , is demonstrating a small , simple , inconspicuous device that may have more practical appeal . Its designer , the late Dr. Clifford Martin Witcher of M.I.T. , was blind himself . <P> Physicist Witcher lost his sight when he was five years old , but blindness did not slow him down appreciably . He graduated from Georgia Tech , won a Ph.D . at Columbia . For sight he substituted an amazing ability to comprehend by ear . He grasped with ease the meaning of equations that he could not see ; he designed complicated machinery without being able to draw or read a blueprint . Sighted students watched with wonderment while he worked with dangerous power tools . <P> During World War II , Dr. Witcher did distinguished work on radar . Later he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This work took him to Haskins Laboratories , New York City , and later to M.I.T. , where he concentrated on practical gadgets . The one demonstrated last week , the only one to be completed before Dr. Witcher 's death last month , is called an Audible Vision Probe . It is about as big as a short , fattish fountain pen , and a thin wire leads from it to an earphone . At one end of the probe is a small lens , and inside is a photocell that is sensitive to differences of light and shade . <P> When a blind person wants to find , for instance , the windows of a room , he swings his probe around and listens for a faint ticking sound in his earphone . The faster the ticking the stronger the light that is reaching the photocell . <P> Most promising uses for the probe are in connection with a blind person 's job . The probe may enable him to read meters , gauges and thermometers , locate lights on telephone switchboards and tell the color of test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the probes , which have been turned over to New York 's American Foundation for the Blind for practical testing .
