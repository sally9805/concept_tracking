txt BRAVES WIN , 13-5 , SCORING 7 IN FIRST ; LEADSERIES , 2T00 Burdette Sets Back Yanks ? Pitcher Caps Big Inning With ** 4-Bagger MANTLE HITS 2 HOMERS Bruton 's Lead-Off Blow Into Right-Field Seats Thrills 46,367 at Milwaukee By JOHN DREBINGER Special to The New York Times . MILWAUKEE , Oct , 2 ? Fred Haney 's Braves scored virtually a one-round knockout today . Then they rolled on to gain their second straight triumph over the staggering Yankees in the world series before another capacity crowd of 46,367 . This time they did it behind the masterly pitching of Lew Burdette , the three-game winner in the 1957 series . Tearing off.seven runs in the first inning , the National Leaguers went on to win in a romp , 13 to 5 , and take a 2.0 lead in the series . The surge in the first put two of Casey Stengel 's hurlers , Bob Turley and Duke Maas , to rout . A home run by Bill Bruton launched the attack , Nearly a half-hour later came the most stunning jolt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homer into the left-field bleachers to close the crushing attack . 8-Run Inning in 1921 It was the second largest scoring inning to be recorded against the proud Bombers , topped only by an eight-run splurge by John . 's Giants against the Yanks ' first pennant-winners in 1921 . The Braves ' total for the day matched the thirteen runs the Giants scored in that game . The Dodgers scored thirteen runs against the Yankees in 1956 . Some two and a half hours later the stunned Bombers somehow managed to crawl out of their stupor . Hank Bauer hit a homer and Mickey Mantle hit his second of the day . That helped make the finish a little more presentable , but not much . For seldom has a Yankee team found itself so humiliated in world series play as Stengel 's American League champions . The last two homers produced three runs , but Burdette , with a mystifying assortment of sliders and sinkers , Was still // on the mound to nail down his fourth successive series triumph over the . Yanks . The tall right-hander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquished the Bombera three times last year , ' the last two with shutouts . In fact , Lew had a string of twenty-four scoreless innings going against the Yanks as he took the mound today . That streak the Bombers snapped with an unearned run in the first inning . But the Braves retaliated in the same round with devastating force and nothing , doubtlessly , jolted the Bombers more than Burdette 's homer , which sent the last three runs of the seven over the plate . Losing to Burdette , the pitcher , could be shrugged off . But having Burdette , a hitter with a season 's .242 batting average , deal the decisive blow was really rubbing it in. 5th Homer by Pitcher It was only the fifth time that a pitcher had hit a homer in an autumn classic . Bucky Walters of the Cincinnati Reds was the last to do it , in 1940 . Jim Bagby of the Cleveland Indians hit one in 1920 , the Giants ' Rosy Ryan hit another in 1924 and the St. Louis Cardinals ' Jess Haines belted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , was it that the Yankee guns unloaded a few random shots near the end . Mantle belted a homer with Gil aboard in the ninth after the Oklahoma 1Kid had hit a solo poke in the fourth . The two homers brought Mickey 's world series total to eleven , second only to Babe Ruth 's fifteen . Beyond that they hardly softened the aches the Bombers suffered as they flew back to New York tonight . In addition to losing the game , the Bombers lost the services of their outfieldercatcher , Elston Howard . Elston , again playing left , suffered -a cut on his left knee as he crashed into the left-field railing in futile pursuit of Burdette 's homer . About the only solace Casey and his Yanks had as they headed home was the fact that they 'll have an open date tomorrow to lick their various wounds , The teams will meet in the third encounter in the fourof-seven series at Yankee Stadium Saturday . The Yanks were barely through congratulating themselves on having scored at least one run off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning got under way . It gained momentum at an alarming rate of acceleration . Bruton wiped out with one swish of his bat the one-run lead that the Yanks so painstakingly had built . The tall Alabaman , who broke up yesterday 's opener with a tenthinning single , smacked a 3-2 pitch off Turley well up into the densely packed right-field bleachers . Double for Schoendienst In the wake of that jolt Red Schoendienst rifled a two-bagger past Bauer in right . Turley momentarily stalled the Braves ' attack by slipping a third strike over on Eddie Mathews , But with the next batter it rolled on . Hank Aaron drew a pass and when Wes Covington followed with a single to right , Schoendienst galloped home . That was all for Turley . Maas , a young right-hander obtained by the Yanks from the Athletics , ambled from the bullpen . But Duke brought little immediate relief for the harried Bombers . He did hold Frank Torre , playing first base for the Braves , to a fly in short left . Howard caught it and followed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash for second . Del Crandall now walked , filling the bases . When Johnny Logan slammed a single into left , runs three and four came in , with Crandall racing to third and Logan grabbing second . Seconds later Burdette tossed the gathering into a delirium of joy as he sent his homer rocketing into the left-field stands . As Howard and Mantle converged on the spot where the ball sailed over the railing and into the seats , Mickey had the good sense to pull up . But Howard kept going and banged into the fence . He had to leave the game . At the same time a crestfallen Maas vacated the mound to make room for Johnny Kucks . This lean right-hander finally collected the third out of the inning as Bruton , up for the second time , lined out . The weather was still in a relenting mood . In fact , it provided an almost ideal setting . The sun shone as brilliantly as Series Standing and Figures Standing of the Clubs W. L. Pct . Braves 2 0 1.000 Yankees 0 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

There were , however , some apprehensive moments for Milwaukeeans in that first inning as the Braves not only threw a blot on Burdette 's scoreless skein but also threatened to tear things apart at the start . However , as was the case in yesterday 's first inning , the Bombers ' offensive again Miffed a golden opportunity to rip the game wide open . For though the Yankees filled the bases with nobody out , one run was all they were to extract from this inviting position . Even that was unearned . Bauer opened the Yankee first , as he did the opener , with a solid single . This extended Hank 's record streak of consecutive world series games in which he has hit safely to sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have unsettled most any pitch equipped with less fortitudi than the lanky Milwaukee right-hander . bounced a high hopper to Mathews , who fielded the ball on a short hop with plenty of time to make the putout at first . But he threw the ball in the dirt and , as it shot by Torre at first , Bauer raced to third and wound up at second . Mantle received an intention . al pass , filling the sacks , and the crowd sat in breathless silence . It was n't kept long in suspense . Howard grounded to Schoendienst . It was too slow a roller to permit a double play , but the Braves ' agile second sacker got the ball to second in time for a force while Bauer scored . Curiously , it was Bauer who had scored the last previous Yankee run against Burdette . He hit a homer in the third inning of the second game last October . A moment later the inning ended as Yogi Berra also grounded to Schoendienst , who converted this one into a double , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marker on a two-bagger , by Mathews and Covington 's second single in a row . The Braves , therefore , were leading , 8 to 1 , when Mantle , first up in the fourth , whacked a 400-foot blast down the cmter of the fairway and into the bullpen . The Braves scarcely seemed to pay attention to what the Yankees were doing . Finding ancient Murry Dickson on the mound in the seventh , the Milwaukeeans opened fire for two more runs on singles by Aaron , Covington and Torre , plus a sacrifice fly by Crandall . And for a final broadside the Braves came up with three in the eighth . Young Zack Monroe got in the way of the bullets here . The hits included a second two-bagger for Schoendienst and singles by Mathews and Aaron . In all , the Milwaukeeans totaled fifteen hits for the day . Most of the fans already were heading for the exits when the Yanks let their conquerors have a final despairing salvo as a parting gesture . Bauer hit a homer , his fifth in series play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norm Siebern singled before Burdette retired a man . But here Lew decided the fun had gone far enough and quickly snuffed out the next three .
