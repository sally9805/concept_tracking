Evita Pern and Fleur Cowles have a number of things in common . They are both blonde , sleekly dressed and eminent go-getters who came up the hard way . Some 18 months ago , Fleur , accompanied by her husband , Publisher Gardner ( Look , Quick ) Cowles , paid a 5-day visit to Argentina , during which she met Evita . Fascinated , Fleur came home and wrote a book , her first . Published this week in Manhattan , * the book shows Fleur 's flair for the feminine glance , supplemented , as she says , " by my own sharpened intuition . " <P> The two women met in President Peron 's office . " She was elegantly dressed , " writes Fleur , " as millions of American women would like to be dressed . The only giveaway was the orchid in her lapel see cut . No real flower that , but one of diamonds , larger even than an orchid , about five inches across by seven inches high-a brooch of big , pure white diamonds that must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ball-like diamond ring were minor accessories by contrast . . . " + <P> Presidential Eye . " She stared back at me at first with a cold , unpleasant look . " But " after she 'd taken in every part of me ( including the black pearl and diamond pin I wore ) , " Evita asked Fleur to stay a while . <P> " She displayed a willingness ( later , eagerness ) to talk ' girl talk ' about clothes , jewelry , coiffure . . . She kept eying the jewel I wore . Peron winked at me and said in his halting English : ' That 's one she ca n't have . ' " When Fleur remarked that Evita 's hair was " very becoming worn straight and simply , she asked if I would look at pictures of her in the many ways she 'd worn it . " Big photographs were spread on the floor . Fleur looked them all over and pronounced Evita 's latest hairdo her best . " Evita asked my age . When I told her mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " About six or eight years shy , Fleur thought . <P> Before their chat ended , Fleur got a chance to ask Evita how she kept track of the estimated $100 million a year that flows into her Social Aid Foundation . " I put the question to her carefully , saying I presumed she kept a very strict accounting of every dollar spent . ' How else will history give you credit for your charitable efforts ? ' was the way I put it . She brushed history and the accountants aside without blinking an eye . ' Keeping books on charity is capitalistic nonsense ! I just use the money for the poor . I ca n't stop to count it , ' she reported . " <P> Intuitive Eye . Having collected her facts about Evita , Fleur said that they only confirmed her first intuitive size-up . Summing up , in her woman's-magazine style , she wrote : " Not a woman 's woman , with a warm remembrance of moments spent like any woman with her friends . . . not a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a woman politico ... a woman too fabled , too capable , too sexless , too driven , too overbearing , too slick , too sly , too diamond-decked , too revengeful , too ambitious-and far , far too underrated far , far too long by our world .
