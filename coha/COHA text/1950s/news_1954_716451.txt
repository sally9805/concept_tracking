txt French Premier Pierre Meddes-France 's economic revolution , a program designed a overcome in a few years a 40-year time lag in France 's whole economic picture , has received a confidence vote by the French National Assembly . The official count showed that 361 deputies were in favor of giving the Premier special powers for the period until next March 31 , while 90 voted against it . In his prevote address Aug. 10 the Premier said that " France is asleep . It must be awakened . This is a difficult but possible task . It must reintegrate the working class into the nation . associate more closely metropolitan France and the overseas territories , and reinstate each Frenchman in France by showing that if short term , certain interests diverge , in the long term it is the ensemble which the French will lose or save . " Challenged by members who had pointed out that such sweeping special . powers as he demands to carry out his reforms had only been asked before in times of crisis , M. Mendes-France explained the urgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment . ' Problems Accumulate He pointed out the great accumulation of economic , financial , and social problems which have piled up without solution and said they now demand haste . He first took the question of balance of payments . He said this had lieen met so far by the ' aid of a friendly nation ( the United States ) but that such aid can not be considered as permanent , so France must establish a balance on its own . While an improvement in exports had been noted , continued the Premier , this was due to the fact that the other European nations have lived up to their promises to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation to liberalize their trade , thereby permitting French goods to be sold on their markets . France had not liberalized its trade as promised and if it did not make changes permitting it to do so very soon , then these nations must close their frontiers to France and a new unbalance would appear . M. Mendes-France said a second problem calling for quick action was that France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so advanced in giving their workers such aid and that this greatly increased the problem of France competing with these nations in the export market . I'Must We Wait ? ' The third problem calling for haste , said the Premier , is the need for raising the living level . " Must we , " he asked , " await demands and strikes and thus be forced to grant this relief ? Is n't it rather necessary to take steps through the expansion of production to improve the living conditions of the largest num-ber ? " Expressing his desire to give the working class the part of the national revenue which belongs to them , M. MendesFrance spoke against the danger of relief by inflation and he insisted in particular on the extension of collective agreements in the interest of the workers . A relationship must be established between the salary level and the production level , said the Premier , stating that it had been decided to make this adjustment on the first of October and the first of April of each year . Next . M. Mendes-France took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving assurance to each one that he will continue to work where he is , but rather to guarantee to him that he will no longer be the victim of economic hardening of the arteries . Our object is to reestablish the balance between offer and demand in the labor market , and to this end funds for readaptation of workers will be created. ? ' Modernization Urged Turning to the reconversion needed to quickly modernize France so it can be competitive , M. Mendes-France said the idea is old . Thus the artisans in the villages adapt their production to the new necessities . However , this adaptation has been slowed down for 30 to 40 years . The state must speed up aid for those who desire to throw off the brakes developed over these years by bad habits and administration . Regarding agriculture. , the Premier underscored the fact that the development of farm revenue stimulates the entire economic ensemble of a nation and that it would be an error to develop the urban level without improving that of the country . M. Mendes-France denied that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) character . He called them liberal because based on competition .
