txt Letters to The Times Communist Propaganda Pattern of ** Aimed at Discrediting Britain Traced To Tits EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES ; I have spent the last ten weeks traveling America and have been impressed by the pattern of neo-Commufist propaganda . The Communists are as ingenious as the Nazis in the invention and circulation of rumors calculated to make bad blood between America and England . Much of their camouflaged propaganda is aimed at conservative and also Catholic elements in the United States . Their directives would seem to be as follows : 1 . To emphasize the disparity between American and European forces in Korea . I regret this disparity , but I understand it . The ordinary Englishman and Frenchman feel that they have been suffering casualties and fighting since 1945 in the war against communism without invoking the U. N. to assist them in defending their territory in Malaya and Indo-China . They feel , rightly or wrongly , that Korea was mainly the American responsibility and that the present war is largely due to the blunder of withdrawing American forces from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to rearm , as they are already in occupation of great parts of the European Continent , and if twenty-five American divisions faced a hundred Russian divisions oit the Canadian frontier very few American soldiers would be deflected to Germany if Germany rather than Korea had been selected as the venue for a Russianpromoted " civil war . " 2 . " France will fold up and not fight . " France has . not yet folded up in Indo-China and is still fighting . 3 . " Attlee is more of an appeaser than Chamberlain . England wo n't fight . " England , like America , always disarms after victory and shrinks from the thought of a new war , but the England which welcomed Chamberlain back from Munich with undignified rejoicings was the England which fought on alone in 1940 . And the England of 1940 is not dead . 4 . " Great Britain is finished . The Labor Government are Marxists and the British wo n't resist Russian Marxism . " In 1945 I was invited by the Army education authorities to lecture to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary of a lecture on the threat of Soviet imperialism . I was told that ' I was free to express my own views . A Communist M. P. subsequently demanded my head on a charger but the Labor Minister of War gave him no satisfaction and wrote me a friendly letter in which he stated that he had received very satisfactory reports of my lectures . I myself am a conservative who voted against the present Government but I have every confidence in their determination to resist , and in the substantial similarity between their policy and the policy of your Government .

Voluntary Fingerprinting Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A news item reviewing a book in THE TIMES recently refers critically to the millions of fingerprints kept on file by the F. B. I. Thousands and perhaps millions of persons , including myself , have voluntarily placed their , fingerprints on file with the F. B. I. , as a possible means of identification in case of violent death . With atomic assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the book should serve the constructive purpose of re-emphasizing the advantages to one 's family in voluntarily having one 's fingerprints taken by the F. B. I. and filed with that bureau . NORBERT BROWN . New York , Dec. 8 , 1950 . Gifts for Prison-Shadowed Homes To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Each holiday season many of your readers generously aid in the work , begun by Maud Ballington Booth over fifty years ago , of carrying Christmas into prison-shadowed homes across the nation . With the passing of/ " The Little Mother , " as she was known by many prison inmates and their families , the prison world lost a friend , but the work she began and to which she devoted her life as part of The Volunteers of America program continues to serve needy mothers , wives and children who , with their breadwinners in prison , suffer through no fault of their own . Gifts of new clothing , toys and funds will help us to replace in many a cheerless home the sadness of being forgotten with the gladness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be sent to the Volunteer Prison League , care of The Volunteers of America , 34 West Twenty-eighth Street , New York 1 . N. Y. CHARLES BRANDON BOOTH , Commander in Chief , The Volunteers of America . New York , Dec. 4 , 1950 . Mr. Wu on American Friendship To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your issue of THE NEW YORK TIMES for Nov. 29 you quoted in full the speech of Wu Hsiu-chuan , ? chief of the delegation to the United Nations from the Central People 's Government of the People 's Republic of ; China . In THE NEW YORK TIMES of Nov. 30 , in your leading editorial entitled " The Biggest Lie of All , " you include the following sentence : " * * * And Mr. Wu might profitably ask himself what are the thoughts of the American people , ' always the enemies of China , ' as they look back * * * . " Unless I have misread Mr. Wu 's statement , I believe that you have in your editorial quoted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the American ' people were always the enemies of China . I have ! ; earthed his statement carefully and find no such reference . On the contrary , I find his only reference to the American people as follows : " In the entire history of China 's foreign relations , notwithstanding-the fact that the peoples of the United States and China have always main- ' tained friendly relations , the American imperialists have always , In their relations with China , been the cunning aggressor * * * . " At no point in his statement does Mr. Wu equate " American people " with " American imperialists " ( just as he does not equate " Chinese people " with " Chinese imperialists " ) . If you wish to , state that you believe Mr. Wu should have equated them , that is your rogative , but I do not believe that your editorial is itself honest ( in discussing Mr. Wu 's lack of honesty ) when it makes what I hope was not an intem ? tional slip as I have described above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 , Jerusalem 's Holy Sepulcher Esthetic and Religious Factors in Rebuilding of Church Considered . ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If reports originating in Roine published in THE TIMES and elsewhere are correct , there is a new threat to the uneasy tranquillity of Jerusalem . The reported church campaign to " fight to win the internationalization of , Jerusalem " opens most unattractive perspectives in the political scene . Moreover , ' it appears to be connected with a sectarian scheme of rebuilding the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem and " guarding of all holy places in Palestine , " which would certainly cause great emotion among the Eastern Christians , who have achieved over the centuries a difficult but workable and juridically established ' arrangement for the ' services at these shrines . The larger question of internationalization will , if we are fortunate , be dealt with by statesmen . A. historian of architecture like myself is entitled to ? raise his voice in regard to the proposed rebuilding of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , for the published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unpleasant . It would spoil a picturesque quarter of the Holy City . It would involve denaturing the remains of the ancient and medieval churches on the site , and it would unfailingly disturb traditional relationships and ancient property rights . The old Rotunda of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , parts of which go back to the first builder , Constantine the Great , deserves instead a careful restoration . It contains a modern edicule on the site of the Tomb of Christ recognized by St. Helena ( A. D. 326 ) . Much of the enclosing Rotunda 's structure is due to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Monomachus ( A. D. 1045-48 ) . In the opinion of William Harvey , who was in direct architectural charge of the building under the British regime , this old work could be brought to light from behind a hasty rebuilding which was carried out by the Greeks after an unfortunate fire ( 1810 ) , In this Rotunda , which was built by Greeks , the Latins have a section , Conversely , in a near-by portion of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks have the choir of their patriarchal cathedral . The Tomb , in the Rotunda , is accessible for services to all of the church groups which have rights in the complex of Sepulcher buildings . The Russians have a claim on the Rotunda through having built its dome ( 1870 ) and they have property rights elsewhere in the group . Consequently a change in the status quo threatens not only to envenom the difficult political situation which is so generally known but also to spoil a venerable old building , to stir very deep-seated religious feelings which are unknown or unsuspected in the West  --  and by a strange quirk of fate to open the way for the Soviets to ' influence the political and religious feelings still further . KENNETH J. CONANT . Cambridge , Mass. , Dec. 8 , 1950 . Crossing the Styx ' With Decorum To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW , YORK TIMES : As a result ( or maybe because ) of my residence in England , I find that my appetite for detailed news accounts is sated only by your excellent jour- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , in the issue dated Nov. 20 , of a thrilling , brakeless bus ride in Colorado is quite disappointing . A splendid opportunity forthe writer to narrate more than a mere " near-tragedy " was " muffed . " ( I hope- , my usage of baseball terminology is correct . ) Surely , the most piquant element : in , the report is the mysterious novel : identified only as " one of those novels " and described RS " he did n't want to get found dead with a , book like that in his hand . " Was the reader reluctant to cross the Styx ( Colorado tributary ) with a salacious novel to while away the trip or was he fearful of carrying a tale so light-hearted and optimistic that it might well offend the morbid sensibilities of Charon ?
