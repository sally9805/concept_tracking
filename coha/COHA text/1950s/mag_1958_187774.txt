If a patient could be kept walking around during major surgery , instead of lying still , he would have a better chance of surviving . Reason : the commonest cause of death after operations is pulmonary embolism-blockage in an artery leading from the heart to the lungs , by a blood clot formed elsewhere in the body . One of the commonest places for such a life-threatening clot to form : the legs , because the blood " pools " there during inactivity . Two Canadian surgeons now suggest an ingenious way of keeping the patient 's leg muscles and veins working about as energetically as though he were walking around , even when he is under deep anesthesia . <P> At Westminster and Victoria Hospitals in London , Ont. , two brothers , Drs . John and Angus McLachlin , decided that the thing to do was to make the calf muscles pump the blood at full rate . To do this , they report in the Archives of Surgery , they attached stimulating electrodes ( similar to the paste-on recording leads used in taking electrocardiograms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A simple electrical pacemaker kept the muscles contracting and the blood flowing , clot-free . The Canadians believe that the method might save a lot of lives if enough surgeons try it .
