All week Congress had been tapping its foot , waiting for the President 's veto of the McCarran anti-Communist bill . In the House , when the page boys burst in with mimeographed copies of the message , members grabbed eagerly at the bundles , helped pass them out . With little more than a glance , they began shouting : " Vote ! Vote ! " And minutes after the clerk had intoned Harry Truman 's 5,500 words of warning , they had overridden the veto without a word of debate , by a thumping 286 to 48 . <P> In the Senate , half a dozen Democrats with the gravity of a band of martyrs had just made another kind of decision . They would try to filibuster long enough for the nation to wire its reactions to the presidential veto message . Perhaps an avalanche of emphatic last-minute protests , plus the Senate 's desire to finish up and go home , might swing the votes necessary to uphold the veto . <P> In Imperfect Wisdom . For five hours , with the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Minnesota 's civil-righteous young Hubert Humphrey , Tennessee 's Estes Kefauver , New York 's Herbert Lehman and North Carolina 's lame duck Frank Graham took turns lecturing against the bill . Their arguments were a direct paraphrase of Harry Truman 's message . <P> The law , the President had declared , was a " terrible mistake . " Parts of it were " a clear and present danger to our institutions . " Ordering Communists to register with the Attorney General , he wrote , " is about as practical as requiring thieves to register with the sheriff . " * And the section ordering the Secretary of Defense to list all defense plants ( so Communists could be barred from them ) was , said the President , like publishing a guidebook for the enemy . <P> Illinois ' big , shaggy Paul Douglas ( who , like Minnesota 's Humphrey , had voted for the bill in the first place ) joined the filibuster . Obviously torn by the issues at stake , Douglas blurted : " In such imperfect wisdom as I have-and I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's veto , " and slumped into his chair with a groan . <P> " Get Some Sleep . " It was a lone-wolf Republican , North Dakota 's rawboned , unpredictable Bill Langer , who stepped up with much-needed relief for the Democratic corporal 's guard . Langer had been obstinately against the bill from its inception , and began his harangue in the clangorous voice that makes every sentence sound like the cry of a newsboy with an extra . Weary Senators drifted off to doze on black leather couches in corridors or handy offices , leaving a few sentinels to guard the Senate floor . Shortly after 2 a.m. , one of Langer 's roars , punctuated by a crashing thump of his fist , frightened a sleeping page boy and sent him sprawling off his chair onto the floor . <P> But by 3:25 a.m. , Langer 's voice was growing hoarse , and his face pale and haggard . By 5 o'clock he was in obvious distress . Humphrey , fresh and trim after a midnight shower and shave , sidled up to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed Langer . " Go get some sleep . "
