Between the acts of Swan Lake one evening last week , the Vice President of the U.S. and his lady strolled to the front entrance of the mammoth opera house that is the pride of Novosibirsk , the raw young industrial city ( pop . 877,000 ) sometimes called " the Chicago of Siberia . " From the impatient , densely packed crowd milling in front of the theater a female voice shouted : " Say something to us ! " <P> Raising his arm for silence , Nixon shouted back : " My wife and I want to thank the people of Novosibirsk for your very warm welcome . " There was a sharp burst of applause , and a few sentences later , when Nixon wound up his impromptu speech with the wish , " May Novosibirsk grow as big as Chicago , " security men were hard put to rescue him unbruised from a rib-crushing onsurge of Siberians determined to shake his hand . <P> Implicit in this mob scene was a fact that came clear from Richard Nixon 's Russian tour : after 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. capitalism , " the majority of the Russian people still like Americans , even if they may also think them odd . <P> The Lodge Brothers . Earlier in the week , flying into Leningrad in an Aero-null null Nixon found himself with unexpected traveling companions-Soviet No. 2 Man Frol Kozlov ( TIME , July 13 ) and his auburn-haired wife . Leningrader Kozlov 's presence on the plane was proof positive that Nikita Khrushchev had recovered from the peevishness over Captive Nations Week that had inspired his jaw-dropping " kitchen summit " with Nixon at the U.S. fair in Moscow fortnight ago . Smiling Frol , who seemed to regard Nixon as a lodge brother in the freemasonry of politicians , saw to it that the Nixons got a proper Leningrad welcome . <P> Sure enough , waiting at Leningrad airport was a friendly , waving crowd-including one Red Chinese who mystified all present by grabbing Nixon 's hand and blurting out an apparently cheery but unintelligible greeting . Politician Nixon proceeded to give Politician Kozlov a boost with the home folks . " Mr. Kozlov , " Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can not come to the Soviet Union without visiting Leningrad . " " Da ! " interjected Kozlov loudly as his fellow citizens chuckled . " These are your constituents , " grinned Nixon . <P> " Nonsense . " This jovial atmosphere cooled when Nixon &; Co. were taken to visit the 16,000-ton Lenin , Russia 's vaunted atomic icebreaker , and Vice Admiral Hyman Rickover asked to visit the ship 's reactor room-only to be told that it was " closed " for the day . " Nonsense , " snapped Atomic Expert Rickover , " the reactor room is never closed . " From Nixon himself Rickover got the firm order : " You stay here an extra day if necessary , and say that it is our understanding that you see just as much as Kozlov saw in the U.S. " <P> Reluctantly the Russians gave way , allowed Rickover to crawl all over the Lenin ( which he pronounced " a creditable job " ) . As the terrible-tempered admiral finally prepared to leave , a Russian official asked him if he was satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am pleased , but I am never satisfied . "
