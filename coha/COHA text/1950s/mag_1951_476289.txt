WHILE I was serving in Germany as Chief of the Motion Picture Branch of Military Government , we produced a documentary film one episode of which took place in an amusement park . There were two entrances to the park ; one marked , " This Way to Heaven , " the other , " This Way to a Lecture on Heaven . " The first was deserted but hundreds of ardent Germans were pouring through the second . Many of my American friends seem to me to have a similar second-hand approach to motion pictures . They read books about them , attend lectures about them , disparage them at cocktail parties . The only thing that they do not do is to attend them , or at least attend those " adult films " about which they talk so earnestly . They pay lip service to the cinema but they do n't pay admission . Or else , if they do , they must represent a very small minority , much smaller than you would suppose from the amount of noise they make . Their talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion researchers concerning double features . Invariably these indicate an overwhelming sentiment against two pictures for the price of one but exhibitors who seek to operate single-feature theaters in competition with double-jeopardy houses quickly discover that this is double talk . Some years ago I was sufficiently na ? ve to prevail upon my partners to institute a policy of playing one carefully selected picture on weekends in Somerville , New Jersey . We operate the only theater in that high class residential community but its inhabitants were not to be deprived of their entertainment bargain . On Saturdays and Sundays they drove to the nearby town of Bound Brook , where my friend and canny competitor , Mr. George Skouras , reaped an unearned harvest until we reverted to sanity and a second feature . At the present time , in some of the , theatrically speaking , depressed areas double features have not only been replaced by triple features but actually by quadruplays , or whatever you care to call four pictures . A NOTHER prevalent myth among the intelligentsia is that foreign films are far superior to American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially a tribute to the skillful and unremitting research of men like Joseph Burstyn ? modesty forbids my mentioning myself . We used to look at hundreds of French and Italian films in an effort to cull out a few that were worthy of importation . Popularity in their domestic market is no assurance of success in the United States . " The Bicycle Thief , " for instance , was a failure in Italy . Theater-goers casually dismissed the plight of the hero which so distressed American audiences . " What a boob , " they said . " If his bike was stolen , why did n't he rent another ? " Occasionally , Mr. Burstyn and I would have the Balboa-Iike thrill of unexpectedly coming upon some superb cinematic treasure but by and large the pictures we looked at were inferior to the American product in story , acting , and technical proficiency . I highly recommend to those who regard Hollywood as a petrified forest of decaying formulas and escapist morasses , a closer acquaintance with the product of Cinecitta and Elstree . The easy game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sedulously cultivated in current books for the cultured anent movies and movie making . A myth maker , appropriately named Powder-maker , descends upon the Pacific Coast announcing her intent to investigate the habits of the strange inhabitants of Hollywood , much as she studied the mores of the South Sea Islanders . In the guise of an anthropologist , she collects an anthology of all the ancient and disgruntled gossip which persistently circulates in the film capital as in all other capitals . This she labels " science " and publishes a book which must be far more embarrassing to anthropologists than to picture people , although practically everyone in the producing end of the industry ? directors , writers , actors , alike ? is labeled venal or frustrated . Jack Rosenstein , intriguingly described as " Hedda Hopper 's leg-man , " is sufficiently candid to make no pretense at scientific research . He announces that nothing is holy in Hollywood , that movies will never produce another great film star , that producers without exception are fat , lazy , and unimaginative , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social significance . Exactly the opposite attack is leveled by my distinguished friend Gilbert Seldes , who titles the first chapter of his book The Great Audience , " The Audience Vanishes , " and who is convinced , profit and loss statements to the contrary , that Hollywood is in sore financial straits because it does not produce enough " mature " pictures to appeal to American audiences . What puzzles me is that these books are greeted with approval in the press althoughan intensely interesting and informative account of movie-making procedures , Case History of a Movie , written by an expert , Dore Schary , receives comparatively slight attention . Our literary critics seem prepared to applaud anything written about Hollywood as long as it is opprobrious . It is easy to understand that having to read as many books as they do , they should have little time to attend pictures , but with their firsthand awareness of the limited relationship between literary merit and best-seller lists , they should , one would think , accept these easy strictures on the screen scene with a reasonable degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to prophesy , with obvious relish , that " the cinema theater , as we now know it , is dead as a dodo . " Book sales have diminished in the past few years but no one , I think , is under the impression that the publishing business is about to disappear . I am equally confident that the movie theater is an institution , which will , for many years to come , continue to flourish . A CTUALLY , motion picture attendance has declined only if we regard the amazing business done by the movies in 1946 and 1947 as normal . That is much like saying that because there were fewer marriage licenses in 1949 than in 1946 there is a declining market for sex . Correctly to ascertain the public demand for any available commodity , movies or marriage , you have to study and chart its course over a period of years . Some utterances of eminent movie magnates may have served to create the impression of impending bankruptcy , but these discouraged gentry remind me of a deceased uncle of mine who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bradstreet are to be believed , the possessor of $10 million . In the Depression years , however , he came upon hard times and passed on feeling hopelessly disgraced . He was down to his last $3 million . In 1939 American theaters grossed $673 million , and in 1948 , the last year for which we have a report from the U. S. Census Bureau , they took in $1,569 million , an increase of 133 per cent . Gone are the lush picture pickings of the years immediately followMYTHS AND MOVIES ing the war , but the seven major companies last year made a profit of over $50 million , almost three times as great as what they reported in 1940 . This profit was earned in the face of a substantial decline in actual movie attendance due in part to the inroads of television ? if I may use so indelicate a word in a magazine designed for home consumption . It hardly seems surprising that the appearance of an amazing new phenomenon in the field of entertainment should exert a profound effect on competitive forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , or going to the movies . It is premature to estimate , however , what the permanent effects of television on motion-picture attendance will prove to be . Investigations conducted in Washington and Detroit seem to indicate that after a period of six to nine months the interest of all except its juvenile devotees wanes and that papa , mama , and the older children revert to previous patterns of passing time . As far as the movies are concerned , television , like radio , may eventually prove not an antagonist , but an ally . It has already helped to develop talent for the screen . It is serving increasingly as the ideal medium for advertising coming attractions . It will eventually hugely expand the appeal of motion-picture theaters by enabling them to show prize fights , crime investigations , and baseball games while they are taking place , national spokesmen delivering important addresses , and current shows while they are still on Broadway . It may siphon off some of the less critical movie patronage , which might prove to be a blessing in disguise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insatiable demand for more talent and material than can reasonably be anticipated , and of advertising budgets which can not hope to equal potential box-office receipts , will for a long time shackle television as a competitive medium of entertainment . Visualize " King Solomon 's Mines " on a nineteen-inch rather than a nineteen-foot screen , William Wyler turning out a picture a week instead of one a year , or " Born Yesterday " with Brod Crawford , after knocking in Judy Holliday 's teeth , delivering a few comments concerning the merits of Colgate 's Dental Cream , and you have some vision of the problems confronting television . III OST of the industry 's highbroW critics , however , are disinterested in the possible inroads of television on movie revenue . When they speak of a " lost audience " they refer to a presumably frustrated group of seekers for " mature films . " This substantial segment of the public they affirm is being denied the privilege of seeing the type of pictures they crave by the obstinacy and stupidity of the movie moguls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of criticism at Messrs . Skouras and Schenck , Zanuck and Zukor , but never has it been suggested that they were inferior in business acumen and foresight to writers or scientists . The bulk of the pictures they make are rented on the basis of a percentage of exhibitor receipts and the fluctuations of those receipts affords a daily national barometer of what audiences accept and what they reject . If a large portion of the American public really desires pictures with greater intellectual , social , or artistic content it can get them and get them quickly by acting in the only fashion that any business enterprise , whether it makes pictures , pajamas , or pretzels , can understand . It can make them profitable . In my experience of over thirty years in the motion-picture industry the American people have had plenty of opportunities to support such pictures and almost invariably have failed to do so . Although I have helped to import many of the finest pictures ever brought into this country , I was able to maintain this activity only because I was simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The profits on the bad pictures enabled me to stand the losses on the good ones . Most of the critics of the industry are optimists because they only write and speak about the demand for superior films . I am a pessimist because I have invested my money in them . My first movie boss was Mr. Sam Goldfish . He was in business with Archie Selwyn and when they separated Archie claimed that Sam not only lost his money but took half of his name . Under any monicker , however , Goldwyn is a lover of the beautiful and a man of fine perceptions . He has frequently been many years ahead of his time and prepared to shelve his unquestioned commercial sagacity for a gesture to posterity . Back in the prehistoric movie days of which I am speaking he proved his courage and endangered his position as president of Goldwyn Pictures by importing the sensational first modern art feature , " The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . " It was sensationally unsuccessful . I was involved in this disaster and made lifelong enemies among exhibitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening it ? the only way in which they could ever have been induced to book it . In the prewar years Warners distinguished themselves with a series of films dealing with the great political and ideological issues of the day ? " Juarez , " " The Magic Bullet , " " They Wo n't Forget , " and " Watch on the Rhine . " These fine productions brought out reams of favorable critical comment but a deplorable paucity of patrons . They were discontinued and Warners today would as soon think of producing a picture on a controversial issue as of presenting American motherhood in an unfavorable light . As far back as 1934 I wrote a piece in Liberty entitled " Why Hollywood Loses Money on Good Pictures , " which compared in painful detail the box-office receipts of such intelligent productions as " Berkeley Square " and " The Emperor Jones " with the intake of such moronic abortions as " The Half Naked Truth " and " They Had to Get Married . " A short time thereafter / met Cecil B. De Mille and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say good pictures lose money ? My pictures are invariably profitable . " Quick as a flash at this embarrassing moment , I responded , " But yours are the run of Dc Mille pictures . " A few years later I was instrumental in persuading Adolph Zukor to make a screen version of the delightful imaginative play " Beggar on Horseback . " James Cruze converted it into charming picture terms , but not long after its release Mr. Zukor spotted me on the street . He shook his fist playfully under my nose . " If I make any more pictures of the kind that you suggest , " he said , " I 'll be a beggar without any horse at all . " Only recently Walter Wanger told me that in his memorable career receipts on his pictures have been in approximately inverseratio to their cinematic merits . The public made the pot boil with potboilers like " Arabian Nights " and " Canyon Passage " but they were cold to masterpieces like " The Long Voyage Home " and " Stagecoach . " Equally unprofitable were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Remember , " Leo Carey 's " Make Way for Tomorrow , " and William Wellman 's " The Ox Bow Incident . " 0 F COURSE there have been exceptions to my thesis . How many depends upon a definition of what maturity in films consists of , a study in semantics left in the limbo of uncertainty by their proponents . " The Lost Weekend , " " The Best Years of Our Lives , " " Henry V , " if they qualify , were all unquestioned box-office successes although , I suspect , not entirely for reasons related to their intellectual content . Those who contend that there has been marked progress in recent times in the reception of more serious subjects , are , I think , victims of wishful thinking . Two years ago Humphrey Bogart 's " The Treasure of Sierra Madre " was received so unkindly that he had to revert to smacking alluring ladies in alluring places to regain his popularity . Dore Schary , upon becoming head of the Metro studio , made a notable effort to raise the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - which Bosley Crowther of the New York Times called " one of the great cinematic dramas of our times . " It proved one of the great cinematic flops of all times . Mr. Schary has now gone back to the mines ? profitable mines , I rneau ? such as King Solomon 's . His recent tribute to liberalism , " The Magnificent Yankee , " is as unworthy of a great judge as it is of a great studio executive . Stanley Kramer , after leaving the U. S. Army , devoted himself to making exactly the type of pictures for which the intelligentsia plead . Recently he fashioned with rare skill and courage a film about paraplegic veterans . Archer Winsten of the New York Post termed it " superb , popular entertainment . " Certainly it was superb . Equally certainly it was not popular . It was entitled " The Men " but apparently neither men nor women , regardless of brow measurements , cared to attend a nonsentimentalired treatment of so grim a subject . Two years ago Universal was over $4 mil-lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reactivated by a profit of almost a million and a half . This was largely due to the " Ma and Pa Kettles , " a series ingeniously tailored for what is insultingly known as the family trade . The pictures cost about $500,000 each to make , and although they play almost exclusively in small towns and neigh-borhood theaters , gross about $2,500,000 . It will require three of them , however , this year to make up for the losses that Universal will suffer from its dalliance with the world of fantasy in a fine screen version of " Harvey . " Similarly , Paramount redeemed the heavy loss it suffered with Willie Wyler 's exquisite " The Heiress " when it produced " Samson and Delilah , " ' which will gross approximately $11 million , probably the third most successful picture in movie annals . The average film plays to an audience of about thirteen million people but " Samson and Delilah " should triple that figure . It would appear as if what the industry needs is more Victor Matures ( not to mention De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonanza is " At War with the Army . " In the face of a withering barrage from the reviewers , " The Army " wrecked the non-holiday box-office record for the New York Paramount Theater with an opening week of $110,000 , and it is wreaking similar havoc across the entire countryside . Frequently , as I observe , and I do so almost daily , the good receipts for what good people call bad pictures , and the bad receipts for what they call good , I am reminded of Henry Mencken 's sour dictum , " No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public . " IV T HE indomitable Mr. Seldes , however , is not so easily discouraged . He contends the fault is not with the taste of the public , but with the distribution practices of the major companies . They ought , he says , to play the adult pictures in the little theaters , and I imagine the adultery ones in the big theaters . Prejudiced as I am by a financial stake in several small houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters . The problem , however.of inadequate public support for what it refers to disparagingly as " message pictures " lies far deeper than any distribution practices . I played King Vidor 's stirring pre-New Deal saga , " Our Daily Bread , " at the little Rialto to unprecedentedly low receipts . I sought to enlist the support of every social-minded organization in New York City with a picture about child labor called " Boy Slaves . " I wanted it to be a great success , not only for the personal profit and satisfaction involved but also to encourage RKO to make more pictures of this nature . I advertised it widely in the liberal press . I spoke about it before ladies ' clubs and in YMCA halls . I brought it to the attention of editorial writers and columnists . It lasted just six days ! I freely admit that the Rialto , which specialized in pictures of murder , mayhem , and mystery to such an extent that I became known as the Merchant of Menace , was not the correct theater to play a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the so-called art theaters of which there are approximately 250 located in the larger cities and select suburbs . These used to be referred to as " sure-seaters " because of their sadly limited patronage . They are transformed , however , into sure non-seaters when they play pictures whose appeal is sensual rather than sensuous . At present , for instance , " Bitter Rice , " an Italian film , is attracting hold-out audiences in all of the " art " theaters of the United States . It is devoid of cinematic merit , but as Howard Hughes said of " The Outlaw , " there are two good reasons why every man should see it . There were plenty of good reasons why people of taste and artistic appreciation would want to see " The Titan , " recently crowned by the National Board of Review as the best foreign film of 1950 . This magnificent study of the life and works of Michelangelo played in the same group of small theaters but it has not yet recovered the modest cost involved in its American re-editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Quiet One " in these houses . The movie critics rallied to the support of this lovely little picture with the marvelous reviews which it so fully merited . Our final gross was less than that of many Hollywood shorts ! Actually , the only sensational successes scored by Burstyn and myself in the twenty years in which we were engaged in business ? incidentally the longest period that anyone has ever survived the hazards of supplying foreign films to American audiences ? were with pictures whose artistic and ideological merits were aided and abetted at the box office by their frank sex content . These we were able to exhibit profitably in big theaters as well as small . " Open City " was generally advertised with a misquotation from Life adjusted so as to read : " Sexier than Hollywood ever dared to be , " together with a still of two young ladies deeply engrossed in a rapt embrace , and another of a man being flogged , designed to tap the sadist trade . The most publicized scene in " Paisan " showed a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side on what was obviously not a nuptial couch . In the case of " The Bicycle Thief , " which was completely devoid of any erotic embellishments , the exhibitors did their best with an imaginative sketch of a young lady riding a bicycle . The Motion Picture Association rushed in to reinforce their efforts by denying it a seal unless the little boy with an urge to urinate was eliminated . In spite of this inadvertent first aid to the box office , and in spite of the critics ' rave reviews , it did far less business than either " Open City " or " Paisan . " V UCH has been made of the fact that approximately two-thirds of movie attendance comes from people under thirty-five years of age . I can not see , however , why this should be a source of surprise to anybody . If I go to a football game , or into a store that sells sheet music or to a night club ( I never do , but if I did ) I am surrounded almost exclusively by young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth likes to go out ; middle age likes to stay home . Youth is eager for entertainment ; middle age prefers ease and comfort . I do not agree , however , for one moment that on youth 's shoulders alone rests the responsibility for the popularity of some tawdry , trashy pictures any more than they are responsible for the popularity of some tawdry , trashy books and plays . Surely it is to the young rather than to the old that we must look for the interest in experimental techniques , the readiness to accept innovations and creative ideas , the willingness to greet new faces on which all progress rests . The vast auditorium where Cinema 16 holds its showings of strange avant-garde documentaries is composed 99 per cent of people not under thirty-five but under twenty-five . When I attended Cocteau 's " Orpheus " I looked around in loneliness for another gray head beside my own . I thought the picture bordered on the ludicrous but that is exactly how my mother felt thirty years ago about " Caligari . " If my own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well advised to continue to aim its primary appeal at youth . Recently I imported a charming compilation of movie clips made at the turn of the century whose major box-office value resided in their appeal to a nostalgic older generation . The nostalgic older generation , however , preferred to remain home by the fire or television side . " Paris 1900 " bids fair to lose me $19,000 . When , however , I acquire a film like " Seven Days to Noon , " which deals realistically with the threat of the atom bomb to men and women of every age , a younger generation which wants to live sweeps the picture to a success . During the past year , however , Hollywood can not fairly be accused of catering exclusively to any single age or interest group . It has sought to speak to every segment of the people with diversified products like " Ail About Eve , " " Annie Get Your Gun , " " Asphalt Jungle , " " Battleground , " " Born Yesterday , " " Cheaper by the Dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hours , " " Glass Menagerie , " " Halls of Montezuma , " " Harvey , " " Intruder in the Dust , " " Jackpot , " " Mr. 880 , " " No Way Out , " " Of Men and Music , " " Panic in the Streets , " " Red Badge of Courage , " " Sunset Boulevard , " " The Brave Bulls , " " The Men , " and " Twelve O'Clock High . " I do not claim that these are pictures which future ages will cherish , nor do I expect anyone , myself included , to be enthusiastic over every one of them . What I do maintain is that in the face of censorship restrictions , pressure groups , police authorities , and now license commissioners , they represent a wider general appeal and a higher average of merit than that supplied by popular fiction magazines , by the radio , or by television , and fully as high as that of current books or drama . The results with these films and with all the others released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bride " to the equally incredible debacle of " The Magnificent Yankee , " are now being carefully appraised in the offices of every major picture producer . These studies are not confined to Hollywood pictures . English and foreign films are given the same meticulous scrutiny . When we imported " Open City " Rossellini was catapulted overnight into world-wide demand . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cabled an offer to the Boulting Brothers , producers and directors of " Seven Days to Noon , " almost simultaneously with its successful New York premiere . In the field of distribution and exhibition there may have been collusion and conspiracy among the picture companies , but in their production the fiercest competition exists for talent and for popular means of employing it , The shape of films to come is daily molded in the curve of yesterday 's box-office window . You may deprecate that box office as a standard of merit but in the words of an insignificant writer with whom I find myself constantly in amazing agreement , " It is an unfailing barometer of what we want in our heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The responsibility , " if I may continue to quote from Arthur Mayer in the Theatre Arts Anthology , " for making the motion picture a mighty instrument of mankind 's hope and salvation lies not with producers , distributors , or exhibitors , not even with authors or directors , but with the audience . That audience is you and me and our relatives and our friends . If we support , not with chatter but with cash , not in the drawing room but in the theater auditorium , those films which give a true account of our honest problems and highest aspirations , we can make our motion pictures a symbol and token of all striving humanity ? a living voice speaking among the people .
