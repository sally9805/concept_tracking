txt Our Washington bureau reported the other day that resistance is developing among officials of the International Cooperation Administration ( foreign Riders ) to the Budget Bureau order to hold foreign aid spending for the fiscal year starting next July 1 down to $3.5 billion . We 'd like to say right off that we think the $3.5 billion ceiling is far too high in any case . By the end of fiscal 1959 foreign aid spending since the end of World War II will be approaching $60 billion  --  and a great deal of it has turned out to be wasteful and unnecessary . The original purpose of foreign aid was to get Europe back on its feet . The purpose now , so far as we can see , seems to be to - spend for spending 's sake  --  as witness the instance where the Government was salaaming to King Saud ( whose income is $250,000 , - 000 a year from the oil companies ) to come pick up that $25 million we promised him . So it is not a matter of wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order placing a ceiling on spending . Mr. Hollister , the outgoing aid administrator , has directed his agency , the Defense Department and the State Department to plan their foreign aid programs on a basis of need and forget about the ceiling . Well , to that we say , Fine . If the Government really rneasurbs foreign aid spending by that yardstick , even the taxpayers can forget about the ceiling . For if actual need actually becomes the yardstick , foreign aid spending that year or any other wo n't be anywhere near $3.5 billion .
