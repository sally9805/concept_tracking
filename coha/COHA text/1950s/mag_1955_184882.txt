Ever since Homer called it " the navel of the sea , " Malta has been an island in search of an umbilical cord . ' Alone and vulnerable in the Mediterranean , 150 miles south of Italy , the rock ( 9 by 17 miles ) has no economic value . But a fine deep harbor on its northeast shore has brought it the " protection " of a succession of great seafaring peoples , Phoenicians , Romans , Arabs , and for nearly 300 years , the crusading Knights of St. John of Jerusalem . Napoleon cut that tie . Then came Nelson , and the island , at the request of the Maltese themselves , became a crown colony . <P> The British proved to be the most casual of mothers . They set up a dockyard at Valletta harbor , and for more than a century , the Navy Estimates were the most exciting thing that happened in Malta , as well as the chief source of livelihood of its 320,000 inhabitants . But the island hardly interested the British until , in World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Italians and the Germans for control of the Mediterranean . Then , as a British air and naval base , with the Maltese dug into its golden limestone , the island held out against one of the most intense and blistering air bombardments of all times . <P> When it was over , with some 1,500 Maltese killed and 30,000 homes lost , the British awarded the island a George Cross , voted $90 million for repair , forgot about Malta again . <P> In 1953 , without consulting the Maltese , NATO made the island its Mediterranean headquarters , but the very existence of NATO was a reminder that the days of British naval supremacy , and possibly dockyards , were over . Politically-minded Maltese talked of revolution and self-government , but a better idea came up : Why not put a clove hitch in the British umbilical ? Last week Maltese Prime Minister Dom Mintoff and a delegation of Maltese went to London for a round-table conference with a group from the Mother of Parliaments , and put the idea to the British M.P.s in specific terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like Northern Ireland ) . <P> Mintoff proposed that Malta have elected representatives in the British Parliament , pay taxes on the British scale and share welfare state benefits . He also wanted economic integration-but this to come gradually over 15 or 20 years . With Mintoff sat a delegation of his political opposition , who also had come to the conference to lobby for a closer tie ' to Britain ; they preferred complete self-government within the Commonwealth . <P> The British , accustomed for years now to passionate , often violent , demands for severing or diminishing relations with them , listened with expressions of gratified incredulity , agreed to give the Maltese desires full consideration . After all , they reasoned , it is the least a mother country should do .
