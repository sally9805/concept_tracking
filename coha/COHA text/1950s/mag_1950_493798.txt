EXCESS PROFITS TAX PROS AND CONS ONLY A FEW short weeks ago , an excess profits tax seemed almost certain of passage when Congress reconvened after its election recess . Today , the prospects for enactment of an excess profits tax , whether in this Congress or the new one , seem doubtful indeed . This change in outlook is due to more than the election results . It is due in large part to the extremely effective criticism which has been advanced , not only by conservative businessmen , but also by business moderates like the Committee for Economic Development , and outstanding economists like Sumner Slichter and Arthur Davies . The caliber of this opposition and the apparent logic and cogency of their arguments certainly warrant a reconsideration of the entire question . Let us start out by recognizing that most businessmen do not dispute the necessity for higher taxes on corporate profits . No responsible business spokesman has taken such an untenable position . There is general recognition that the Government 's prospective deficit in fiscal 1952 ( beginning July 1 , 1951 ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rate of acceleration of military expenditures . Further , there is general agreement that since we face continued high level military outlays for years ahead , we must come as close as we possibly can to paying for them out of taxes as we go , if inflation and an unmanageable public debt are to be avoided . Enlightened businessmen recognize that a large part of the added tax burden will have to be borne by corporate enterprise , by virtue both of equity and ability to pay . The issue , therefore , is not one of choice between an excess profits tax on corporations on the one hand and higher taxes on other segments of the economy ( higher individual income taxes , manufacturers ' excise taxes , retail sales taxes ) on the other . It is rather a question of how much more revenue should be raised by new taxes on corporate profits and what form these higher taxes on corporations should take . No matter what decision is made with respect to corporate profits , we shall have to impose new or larger taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue should be derived from additional taxes on corporate profits ? It would be less difficult to answer this question if we knew more about the course of defense expenditures in the next 12 to 18 months . One needs only to examine the figures ( See Table on page 12. ) to see that corporate enterprise is capable of contributing substantially to the rapidly mounting costs of defense without serious hardship . The postwar period has been one of unparalleled prosperity for America 's corporations . By whatever criterion one chooses ? profits before taxes , profits after taxes , dividends paid to stockholders , profits retained in the business or profits after taxes as a percentage of net worth ? the figures are truly amazing . Profits at the present time fully justify the adjectives which have been used in recent weeks by business journals ? " astronomical " and " out-of-thisworld . " One can best judge the overall effect which various proposals for increasing tax revenues from corporate profits would have by projecting the 1951 situation . It is estimated that in 1951 corporations will earn some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present tax rates ? 45 percent ? some $20 billion would be taken in taxes , and profits after taxes would be approximately $25 billion . The Committee for Economic Development 's proposal to take an additional $3 billion in taxes would leave corporations with some $22 billion after taxes ? about $1 billion in excess of the previous historical high attained in 1948 . The Administration 's proposal to take an additional $4 billion would leave them with some $21 billion ? just about equal to the previous historical high . The AFL 's proposal to take some $5 to $6 billion would leave corporations with $19 to $20 billion , and the CIO 's proposal to take some $6 to $7 billion would leave them with $18 to $19 billion ? levels which may stilt be regarded as handsome in relation to previous experience and returns on investment . In aggregate terms , American corporations could certainly pay an additional $6 to $7 billion without experiencing any real hardship . Within that aggregate , however , a great many corporations could suffer very real hardships indeed , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely this question which is basically at issue in the current debate about the excess profits tax , as we see if we let the supporters and the opponents of the excess profits tax state the pros and cons in their own terms . The Equity Argument Pro : Under an excess profits tax , by far the largest share of additional taxes paid will come from the rela tively small number of corporations whose earnings have increased as a result of the defense effort . Most corporations will not be required to pay more taxes than they are paying now . By taxing away that part of corporate profits which is in excess of - normal , - we shall be taxing in accordance with ability to pay , and we shall eliminate profiteering on the national emergency . Corr : No formula or base period can be devised which will affect all corporations equitably . An excess profits tax will be particularly inequitable in its effect on new corporations which lack a base period of previous earnings ; on companies which had depressed earnings during the assigned base period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand in the absence of defense expenditures . Moreover , no one formula can apply equitably to corporations in different industries , different companies within the same industry , large and small companies . Finally , excess profits can best be recaptured by renegotiation of defense contracts , rather than by an excess profits tax . Rebuttal : No tax can do more than rough justice . Most of the difficulties cited can he mitigated in whole or in large part by appropriate provisions in the law . So far as renegotiation is concerned , that process can not recapture excess profits earned indirectly from the defense effort . The Inflation Argument Pro : An excess profits tax would be anti-inflationary , because when corporations know that they will be able toretain only a small part of the additional profits they might get by raising prices , the incentive to raise prices is considerably dampened . Con : An excess profits tax is inflationary , because when virtually confiscatory taxes are imposed on profits in excess of a given amount , corporations are encouraged to spend money wastefully and extravagently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . They also lose interest in improving production techniques and reducing costs . Their resistance to higher wages is also weakened . All these effects are highly inflationary . Rebuttal : The - confiscatory-  nature of the excess profits tax is reduced by lowering the effective rate to a reasonable level like 75 percent . The extravagence argument has been considerably overdone . Corporations know they inevitably face the day when the emergency will be gone , and they will have to meet tough competition again . They simply can not afford to fall into sloppy production techniques and permit costs to inflate . Corporations never raise wages unless they have to . Provision should be written into the law disallowing abnormally high outlays for certain categories of costs which lend themselves to such corporate abuse . The Int estmeni Argument Pro : Corporations will have less money and less incentive to invest in plant and equipment for the production of luxury and non-essential goods , thus conserving scarce materials , manpower and facilities for the defense effort . Con : The tax would destroy the incentive and the ability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production in precisely those industries where such incentive and ability are most needed . Profits tend to be highest where goods are in short supply , and prices rise in response to shortages . It is these very industries which would be hit hardest by an excess profits tax . While the profit motive can not be permitted to guide expansion of industry in wartime , what we face is perhaps a very long period of partial mobilization , and normal economic incentives will work best in such a period . Rebuttal : Adequate incentive to expand plant and equipment where necessary will be provided through accelerated amortization , as was done during the last war . Expansion loans can be extended by the Government , if necessary . The excess profits tax did not stifle the incentive or the ability of industry to expand during the last war and will not do so now . The Administration Difficulty Argument Pro : In order to raise large sums of money , you 've got to go where the money is . The corporations , particularly those whose earnings have risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An excess profits tax would be almost impossible to administer . Thousands of corporations will appeal for relief on the grounds of inequity or hardship . No administrative set-up can be devised that can settle these cases both equitably and promptly . Even today , five years after the termination of the last excess profits law , there are still 2,700 cases pending involving a far larger number of claims . The Political Argument Pro : Workers , consumers , " little " people generally , have identified the excess profits tax with the elimination of profiteering and a just sharing of the rearmament burden . Their morale will be adversely affected if such a tax is not enacted . Con : The excess profits tax is just another " soak-therich " proposition which panders to popular ignorance and prejudice and is politically motivated . The Alternative Tax Argument Pro : In preference to an excess profits tax , we should impose a higher tax rate on all corporations . A defense supertax should be added to the current normal and surtax rate of 45 percent , bringing the total rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rate of 57 percent , it is estimated , would raise an additional $4 billion , which is the amount the Administration proposes to raise by an excess profits rate of 75 percent on earnings in excess of 75 percent of those averaged in any three years of the 1946-49 period . Con : A higher flat rate on all corporations would be decidedly unfair to the great majority of corporations which will not enjoy increased profits , or even as large profits during the defense period as they did before the emergency . Whereas an excess profits tax might work an inequity on a relatively small number of corporations which could apply for and obtain relief , a higher flat rate would impose inequities on most corporations which could not be ameliorated . How are these arguments to be evaluated ? To what conclusions do they lead ? Obviously , the case ' is not a clear-cut or one-sided one . It is an issue which must be decided on balance , on the side that has the most weight . On balance , the argument favors the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertinent to the excess profits tax of World War II . We need not , however , think of the tax in those terms exclusively . The experience gained ? indeed , the very criticisms which are now offered in opposition to an excess profits tax ? make it possible to write a much better law than we wrote last time . The recommendations submitted by the Treasury have already made considerable progress in this direction . The recent hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee should result in even more . The Treasury recommendations for a base period of 75 percent of the average earnings of any three years during the 1946-49 period , with an alternative base of about 10 , 8 and 6 percent on invested capital ( depending on the size of the corporation ) , should make the tax tolerable for most corporations . Further , the Treasury 's recommendations with respect to minimum credits and allowances for borrowed capital , new capital and " growth " corporations should go a long way toward minimizing or eliminating the inequities which might otherwise be involved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations and consider whether new corporations , or new enterprises of established corporations , should not be exempted from the excess profits rate on their earnings . We might consider , too , whether additional credits against the excess profits tax rate should not be granted in certain industries on behalf of profits reinvested in plant and equipment ( in such an event , of course , presently-planned accelerated amortization would have to be reconsidered too ) . The current debate should be evaluated , not in terms of the excess profits tax we had during the last war , but in terms rather of an improved excess profits tax we are undoubtedly able to formulate now Considered in these terms , a good deal of the cogency of the opposition 's argument vanishes , and the case for an excess profits tax becomes relatively clear .
