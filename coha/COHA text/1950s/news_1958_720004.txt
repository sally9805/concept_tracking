txt Vice - President Richard M. Nixon has laid down the Republican campaign blueprint for the final three weeks . He says that President Eisenhower 's theme , at Chicago , at Cedar Rapids , Iowa , and ' in California will be to re . mind the voters that they have received what they voted for in 1952 and 1956 ? peace , integrity in government , and a booming economy . The issues , Mr. Nixon claims , are now running in favor of the Renublicans  --  althqugh he still ; counts his party as the underdog . He says the fast upturn from the recession and the recent cease-ireintheEarEastare , developments that are going to win a of votes for the , Republicans ? in the final weeks . Mr. Nixon will underscore these points in his coming talks , and he is calling on party workers here and in the Midwest to carry this message to the voters . Upward Swing Seen " Two months ago , " he says , " we hit the low point in our campaign . " But since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift which ' makes the Democratic forecast ( the Republicans losing 12 seats in the Senate and 60 in the House ) a poor one . Mr. Nixon says that froin his personal observation , and from what he hears from knowledgeable observers , the main Republican trouble areas are California and the East . The big ex ception in the East , he says , is New York where he forecasts the state will elect a GOP governor and senator . His greatest hope for Republican gains , Mr. Nixon says , is in the Midwest : " I have never heard more optimism and fight than right here in Cook County . " The Vice-President attributes the brighter Midwest outlook to rising farm prices . The Same Nixon " The last week or 10 days , " Mr. Nixon says , " has brought about a sharp upturn : in the morale of the Republican organizations everywhere , I hope the Democrats keep reading , and believing , their forecast of victory . They 'll find themselves in the same position that we were in after the 1948 campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Te a question about the " Old Nixon " and the " New Nion . " " That 's a legitimate question . After all . I have been ridiculed by experts  --  although I do n't regard that question as ridicule . " Each campaign calls for different campaign tactics . Those experts who say my message today is different from 1956 should review my speeches . I was saying precisely the same thing in 1956 that I am today . " Mr. Nixon 's point is that he is merely saying these things more vigorously today than two years ago : a shift in tactics , not in substance . At least , this is the way he sees himself . Mr. Nixon feels that President Eisenhower will do much to lift the Republican campaign : " He is immensely popular . Everywhere I go I find that the candidates are begging for the President to come out . His popularity is not just personal ? it is because of his stand on issues . When he comes to Chicago , to Cedar Rapids for the cornhusking contest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He says he is not a politician , " Mr. Nixon says of the President , " hut he is one of the most effective political orators of our time . " Pocketbook Issue The big issue In the campaign : " The pocketbook issue , " accordinglto Mr. Nixon . " This is the most decisive issue . The voter will ? be comparing his better economic pOsition ? today with the period before 1952 . And-he will be asking himself whether lie dare take a chance with candidates who will oppose the measures that have brought these good times about . " The foreign issue ? " This could become the decisive issue if the Democrats insist on making it that . " He says that the United States has been able to stop aggression only because it has assumed a firm ? posture . He feels that the American people will see that a ' great deal more was at stake than just the offshore islands .                   @ @
