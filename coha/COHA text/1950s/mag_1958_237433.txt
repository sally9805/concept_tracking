Before he joined TIME , Philadelphia-born John Scott worked as a master welder at Magnitogorsk in the Urals , attended a Soviet engineering school , married a Russian mathematics teacher . In 1941 , two weeks before the Nazi invasion , the Russians ejected Author-Journalist Scott ( for reporting friction between the two countries ) . Last week , after winding up his first visit to Russia in 17 years , Scott wrote : <P> FOR ten days I walked and rode around Moscow from stem to stern , down into the Metro ( there are now nearly 70 stations ) , out into the parks , up into the private apartments of old friends-engineers , professional people , several Russian journalists . There was no case when anyone I tried to see refused to see me . This is remarkable . Most of those I saw , including party members , were quite willing to talk about anything at all , including concentration camps , the secret police and other things which in prewar days were never even mentioned . <P> Foreigners , particularly diplomats and newsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformed police in front of their houses , and tails on most embassy cars . But the tourists , and there were about 10,000 of them in the U.S.S.R. at the time , seemed free to do anything they wanted to , including standing in the lobby of the Moskva Hotel as one American girl did , waving a $20 bill until someone came up to her and bought it at 25 rubles per dollar . ( The official rate is four to the dollar ; tourists get ten at the bank . ) <P> Personally , I made no attempt not to look like a foreigner and was approached a score of times on the street , often near the big hotels that all have uniformed militiamen standing outside them . Sometimes people just wanted to talk , sometimes to buy dollars . ( I tried to find out what they wanted them for ; all said they were buying them for " friends " - perhaps Soviet tourists , of whom hundreds are currently loose in groups in Europe . ) Sometimes teen-agers wanted to exchange Soviet emblems , officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , pens and dollars . In most cases , these people were not disturbed when I spoke to them in Russian . <P> First impression is this : the Soviet Union is still a shoddy , grim , rude place . Stores and public transportation are badly crowded ; the new buildings are poor in quality , as is most clothing ; service is slow even in the National , overlooking the Kremlin , which is Moscow 's best hotel ; the faces on the street are unsmiling , preoccupied , severe . <P> On the other hand , things are vastly improved in many ways . Most important in human terms is that people are no longer scared to death . Second , they are getting enough to eat . Not that you would have any fun with the meals eaten by even upper-class Russians . But they have plenty of healthy food-bread , meat , vegetables , even fruits and delicacies at prices which people can afford . People are much better dressed . I saw not a single pair of the crude bast sandals , visible everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , but in most cases they are sturdy . Housing , though still bad , is better than it was . Moscow 's 5,000,000 people mostly have elementary privacy , in Russian terms , i.e. , not more than one family to a room .
