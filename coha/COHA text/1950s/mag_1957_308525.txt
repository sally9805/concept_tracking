U.S. automakers , whose sales have a prime effect on the U.S. economy , last week lowered their targets . Chrysler President Lester Lum ( " Tex " ) Colbert , who only a few months ago was the soul of confidence as he predicted a 6,000,000-plus year for autos in 1958 , told a Harvard Business School audience that the entire auto industry is in for a poorer year than he expected-though still a good one . " We know that the people have the jobs and that their savings-bank accounts are at a high level , " said Colbert , " but the consumer has lost the desire to buy . " <P> American Motors President George Romney also had reservations about 1958 . He noted that industry sales for the first two months of the 1958 models are running at an annual rate of only 5,800,000 , but he still had hopes for a 6,000,000 year . The reason U.S. auto sales have leveled off for the past few years , said Romney-with a bow to his hot-selling little Rambler-is that the automobile industry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and demand , " i.e. , the increased popularity of smaller , more compact cars . <P> Across the U.S. the sales picture was mixed . " There is simply no business , " said an Atlanta Plymouth dealer . " We are n't even able to attract window-shoppers . " Said a White Plains , N.Y . Cadillac and Oldsmobile dealer : " Sales are very excellent this year-at least 15% to 20% better than a year ago . " <P> The same unevenness showed up in Detroit 's output , which is being closely geared to expected sales . General Motors , which took a drubbing in the 1957 model year , is coming back fast , this month will produce 310,000 autos v. 280,000 for December 1956 . Last week Chevrolet scheduled production of 46,400 cars , which would be an alltime weekly production record for the division . Although Ford insists that its sales are up , it has cut its production to 26% of the industry 's total v. 31% for the first eleven months , is laying off about 5,000 production workers , principally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dallas , where sales are surging . ) Chrysler , which captured more than 20% of the nation 's auto trade during the first eleven months of this year , may slip to 16% of industry output in December ; last week it put its Dodge division on a four-day week . As a result of the cutbacks , the industry 's output for December is 6.8% under production originally planned for the month . <P> One of the big reasons for the industry 's cutbacks is the fact that as of Dec. i , the latest count , an unwieldy backlog of 1957 model's-some 90,000 cars-was still on hand . They pushed the total of dealers ' unsold cars up to 510,505 v. 398,243 on Dec. i last year . With those sobering statistics in mind , the industry last week also slashed projected first-quarter output - by 5.6% of production originally scheduled .
