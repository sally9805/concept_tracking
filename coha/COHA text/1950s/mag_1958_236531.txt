The question of what kind of federal agency should control the U.S. space offensive burst on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue last week . Under discussion by a select and secret committee set up by the President and chaired by Scientific Adviser Dr. James Killian were four possible answers : <P> <P> The Defense Department . As the U.S. pioneers in rocketry and space research , the armed forces are already deeply and impressively competent in the arts of rocketry and space planning , have close connections with the nation 's best scientific brains . Conceivably the Defense Department - through its Advanced Research Projects Agency-could evolve into the overall space agency more rapidly than any new agency . Most scientists agree that defense needs should have first call on space research but vigorously oppose putting any overall program into Pentagon hands . Principal reason : the potentialities of the development of space range far beyond military considerations , should not be confined by military control . Tentatively the President 's thinking is that the military is best able to judge its own space needs , but would weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . <P> The Atomic Energy Commission . Advocates of AEC control argue that since sophisticated space vehicles will be atomic-powered , the fission-knowledgeable Atomic Energy Commission is the logical agency to supervise perfection of such vehicles . Moreover , AEC is a civilian agency already in a scientific business , with a keen understanding of military needs , e.g. , hydrogen bombs , as well as civilian problems , e.g. , atomic power . Opponents point out that AEC maintains no launching sites or rocket laboratories and has insufficient space-trained personnel , could be no more than a management organization farming out work . <P> New Civilian Agency . On the theory that far horizons demand a fresh approach , some space planners advocate an entirely new federal agency that would direct either the entire U.S. space program or , at minimum , its nonmilitary aspects . House Majority Leader John McCormack has proposed a five-member National Science Council . In the Senate , Arkansas ' John McClellan and Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey have sponsored a measure authorizing establishment of a department of science and technology run by a secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency are downrated because the agency would have to undergo the lengthy labor pains of its own birth before it could even effectively contemplate the problems of space .
