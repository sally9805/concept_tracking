While most Senators were extending their Labor Day holiday , Vice President Alben Barkley clomped into the Senate chamber one day last week . Only one Senator , Vermont 's Republican George D. Aiken , was present . But the Senate had agreed that , for the record , it would meet that day . The Veep carried out the formality incident to such occasions . In one quick breath he blurted out : " Undertheorder of Friday last the Senate willstandinrecess unt11 1 20 ' clocknoontomorrow . " Then he banged his gavel . Elapsed time : five seconds . It was a new record. * The shortest previous session , conducted in like manner by President Pro Tern Kenneth McKellar on Dec. 29 , 1950 , took a full nine seconds . <P> Later , back on the job , the Senate buckled down again to its preadjournment grind and cleaned up one sticky matter . It approved the Post Office Department 's decision to continue once-a-day mail service , upped postal rates all round . Subject to House approval , the bill would : Increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that a previous try at a 2 card ( in 1925 ) brought such a drop in its use that the 1 rate was quickly restored . Raise the postage on a regular letter from 3 to 4-the highest rate since 1851 . Up the price of an air mail stamp from 6 to 8 , a special delivery stamp from 15 to 20 . In the next three years increase the rate for mailing magazines 60% and for newspapers 30% . <P> With other increases on such items as parcel post , catalogues and C.O.D . charges , the bill would bring the Post Office Department an estimated $400 million more annually . But it would still leave the department $100 million short of meeting its expected deficit , even before Congress takes up the bill to raise the postman 's pay . <P> <P> *The Veep fudged just a bit , omitted one sentence from the Senate 's S.O.P. : " The Senate will come to order .
