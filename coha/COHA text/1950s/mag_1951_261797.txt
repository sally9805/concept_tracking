When Communist Frdric Joliot-Curie was fired last April as head of France 's Atomic Energy Commission , 13 fellow members protested . " We wish to assure M. Joliot-Curie , " they said , . " that in spite of this measure he retains our entire confidence and our profound attachment . " <P> Last week one of the 13 so profoundly attached to the deposed Red stepped into his job . Socialist Francis Perrin , co-worker of Joliot-Curie 's at the Collge de France , was appointed by the government , nosing out Jean Thibaud , director of the Institute of Atomic Physics at Lyon and member of the right-wing UDSR party . At the same time , the middle-of-the-road government , which is trying to carry atomic fission on both its shoulders , dropped Joliot-Curie 's fellow-traveling wife Irene from the Atomic Commission . This was supposed to appease the antiCommunists . <P> Behind Socialist Perrin 's triumph some thoughtful folk professed to see a measure of Communist maneuvering .

Physicist Alexander Zucker of the Oak Ridge , Tenn . National Laboratory wrote in the current issue of Physics Today : " There is a Communist cell meeting every week . . . Laboratories in Paris are known by their political affiliations rather than by the work they do . Thus we have Clerical laboratories , Communist laboratories , Socialist laboratories . . . " <P> Although Socialist Perrin is not suspected of being a Communist or a fellow traveler , he is certainly more acceptable to the Reds than Thibaud , who is an outspoken antiCommunist . When a learned scientific paper by Thibaud reporting a discovery concerning atomic nuclei was submitted to the Academy of Science , observers considered it more than a coincidence that two bright students of Joliot-Curie should immediately produce papers reporting similar findings . Their papers , forwarded to the academy by Joliot-Curie , switched the limelight from Thibaud , who had been getting a big play in the non-Communist press . <P> Thibaud was furious . He protested to the academy ; then wrote to the Atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no more science in France , " Thibaud told reporters hotly , " science has become nothing but politics .
