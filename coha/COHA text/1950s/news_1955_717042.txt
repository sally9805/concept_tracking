txt John Foster Dulles declared today that the Bricker amendment would make the President " unable properly to conduct foreign relations . " The Secretary of State thus put the Eisenhower Administration officially on record . against the proposal by Senator John W. Bricker , Republican of Ohio , to alter the Constitution to limit the treaty-making power of the Presidency . Mr. Dulles in his formal statement joined President Eisenhower in declaring that the Ad-1 ministration would accept a con stitutional amendment simply " reaffirming " that ' a treaty or Executive agreement in conflict with the Constitution " shall not be of any force or effect . " ( During questioning by members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee before which he testified , however , Mr. Dulles was cool even to such a limited project as this . He agreed with Senator Estes Kefauver , Democrat of Tennessee , that it was , in fact , " unnecessary " to put such a stipulation into the Constitution , since that document already stood supreme . Might Be ' Expedient ' Nevertheless , Mr. Dulles said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " legal " standpoint , it might be " expedient from a political standpoint . " Perhaps , he added , such an amendment might be wise to " give reassurance " that there was no intention of allowing anything to override the Constitution . Frank E. Holman of Seattle , a former president of the American Bar Association , anti one of the earliest and most influential backers of the Bricker amendment , preceded Mr. Dulles to the 1 stan d . Mr. Holman asserted that the " internationalists and humanitarians " had discovered " a loop hole in the Constitution " by which they proposed by treaty arrangements " to change and level out our American rights1 both state and individual and thereby change our form of Government . " He was referring primarily to the proposed Convention on Human Rights , which long has been pending in the United Nations . Mr. Holman asserted that it was Mr. Dulles himself , speaking as a private citizen in 1952 in Louisville , who had given " impetus to the growing demand for a constitutional amendment to protect American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treaty law . " Mr. Dulles was the first Administration witness to appear against the Bricker amendment in hearings that have been in progress a week . : Senator Bricker , who was defeated last year in his efforts , wants to amend the Constitution to provide : That a treaty or other international agreement in conflict with the Constitution would be without effect . That a treaty or other agreement could " become effective as internal law " in this country " only through legislation valid in the absence of international agreement . " This proviso lies at the heart of the controversy . Mr. Bricker argues that it is necessary to avoid having " treaty law " made by agreements that would override domestic law . Mr. Dulles ' answer to this was that Mr. Bricker 's . plan would mean that each of the fortyeight states could have a sort oA veto over foreign affairs . " It would make it impossible ; in the absence of legislation by the Congress and by the fortyeight states , to conclude and make effective many traditional types , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tone and manner to Senator Bricker . He saluted the Ohio Senator for having made an " able " presentation recently . Mr. Dulles said in Louisville in 1952 that treaties " can cut across the rights given to the people by the constitutional Bill of Rights . " Examined by the subcommittee on this point he said that he had " learned something since then . " He conceded that treaties conceivably could take away property rights ? as for example require a citizen to transfer title to a building to a foreign embassy . He said , however , that even this would not be unconstitutional , since property could not be taken in this fashion even under the necessities of a treaty without due process of law and compensation to the owner . At all events , he asserted , treaties could not deprive the citizens of this country of their " human " rights , such as jury trial , a , free press and so on .                   @ @
