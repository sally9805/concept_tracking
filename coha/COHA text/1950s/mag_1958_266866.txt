While other industries are leveling off , the rails have yet to hit bottom . Though a spurt in March carloadings brought rail revenues up , April carloadings turned down , and total revenues , which were also up in March , will probably follow them down . Western roads will be less hard-hit because of an expected boost from bumper grain crops , but Eastern roads face reduced shipments from heavy industry and continuing heavy passenger deficits . The Baltimore &; Ohio reported an April drop of 24.6% from 1957 revenues , a decline of 57% in net income . The Pennsylvania 's April deficit of $4,727,327 ran its loss so far this year to $19,626,948 ; the Illinois Central cut its quarterly dividend to 50 from 75 . <P> Deepest in red ink is the New York Central . In the first four months of ' 58 , the Central lost $20.7 million ; its freight carloadings are running 21% behind last year and its April traffic was 25% under 1957 . At the annual meeting last week President Alfred E. Perlman told stockholders : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has not even been a sign of a complete leveling out or a ' saucering out ' so far as carloadings are concerned . " Furthermore , no black figures are in sight , Perlman said , unless Congress passes some of the relief recommendations of the Smathers bill ( TIME , May 5 ) . With a deficit that will probably run over $50 million , the Central has had a hard time finding stand-by bank credits ; it wants $50 million , but so far has lined up only $25 million . <P> Asked by a stockholder how long the Central could stay solvent , Perlman replied : " I see no difficulty for the rest of this year . Beyond that I do not want to say ; I have no crystal ball . " Asked if dividends could be resumed , Perlman snapped : " Is that question necessary ? " The Central , he added , has deferred a $150 million improvement program , and has been slashing its operating costs . <P> Taking a sarcastic view of President Eisenhower 's optimism , Perlman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President and say things are going to be better every month . If he finally is ever right , however , we 're going to make a heck of a lot of money . "
