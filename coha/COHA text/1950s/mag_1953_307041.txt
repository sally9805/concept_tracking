The basic problem of the U.S.-and of the free world-is to preserve its dynamic economic and political freedoms as it builds up military defenses against global Communism . This is a problem which the U.S. has not really met squarely since the Communists began their march at the end of World War II . Last week President Eisenhower was ready to come to grips with it . <P> Fixing his heavy , horn-rimmed glasses in place , the President faced his weekly press conference and began to read in a low voice . " I would like to present to you . . . with fairly broad strokes , what I consider the sensible framework . . . for an ever more effective posture of defense . " Quickly he came to the heart of his defense-security philosophy : " I have always firmly believed that there is a great logic in the conduct of military affairs . There is an equally great logic in economic affairs . If these two logical disciplines can be wedded , it is then possible to create a situation of maximum military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , these two are allowed to proceed in disregard one for the other , you then create a situation either of doubtful military strength , or of such precarious economic strength that your military position is in constant jeopardy . It has been the purpose of this Administration ever since it took office , finding itself confronted with a crazy quilt of promises , commitments and contracts , to bring American military logic and American economic logic into joint , strong harness . " <P> Continuous Improvement . In this harness , said the President , U.S. policy will not be based on the philosophy of preparing for war by , any certain year of maximum exposure , " but will be based on the sounder theory that a very real danger not only exists this year but may continue to exist for years to come ; that our strength , which is already very real , must now be made stronger , not by inefficient and expensive starts and stops , but by steady , continuous improvement . " Under this " new , fresh " policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " paper divisions and cardboard wings " disregarded , the " artificial arithmetic " erased , and a long-term program established . <P> Then the President got down to figures : " This morning I told the legislative leaders that already we can see our way clear to ask the Congress to appropriate at least $8.5 billion less new money for fiscal year 1954 than had been asked for by the previous Administration . " <P> Harry Truman had asked for $72.9 billion in new appropriations-$41.5 billion for the military , $7.6 billion for foreign aid , $2 billion for atomic energy , and $21.8 billion for other purposes . Dwight Eisenhower did not break down his proposed cuts , but defense ( which eats up almost two-thirds of the budget ) would have to bear the brunt . Bob Taft later told reporters how the slicing would be done : $5 billion off the military budget , $1.8 billion from foreign aid , $250 million out of the atomic-energy program , and $1.2 billion in the other departments .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
