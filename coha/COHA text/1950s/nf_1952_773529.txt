" 14 The power of the patriarch declined and marriage became a more democratic affair . Decay of Roman Empire . Many factors were responsible for the moral decay of the Roman Empire . Here . the impact of this social disorganization on the family is the principal concern , , number of very wealthy families began to appear in the later period . At the same time , the poorer people were losing their farms and moving into cities where they constituted a propertyless class . Urban life began to have its influence on Roman society , and the primary group , as exhibited in the early family , began to decline . The Roman family became what Professor Zimmerman has termed the atomistic family . It was merely a collection of individuals . The old Bens disappeared , and the power of the state increased . Women 's dowries ceased to be the property of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least to procreate , became common . As a result Augustus had passed the Leges Juliae et Papia Poppaea in an effort to encourage marriage and childbirth . Under the terms of this legislation , a father could not prevent the marriage of his children , inheritances based upon agreement to remain single were declared illegal , candidates for office were given preference on the basis of the number of children they had , tax relief was provided for those with a certain number of children , and in general the laws represented an attempt to restore the old Roman family by offering material advantages . 15 These laws , however , did not merely reward those who married and procreated ; they also penalized those who failed to marry or who remained childless . Unmarried persons could not inherit , and married persons who were childless could receive only half of their legacies . The state stood over every citizen and invaded every family . Informers came into existence and plundered the citizens or terrorized them . 16 Yet in the final analysis these measures appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation // delayed the fall of Rome , and the failure of Augustus ' successors to carry on these reforms destroyed their ultimate effectiveness . 17 Temporarily at least , the population increased , but , as Zimmerman points out , the laws were observed in word but not in spirit . One question that should be raised here is whether these laws actually went to the basic cause of the problem . Was not the disorganization in the family at least partly , if not entirely , the result of a wider social disorganization reflected in one of society 's basic institutions ? In other words , were not the reforms aimed at symptoms rather than causes ? Comparison of the Three Types of Family . From this very brief discussion of the non-Christian and pagan families there emerges a certain pattern . During the periods when the family was strong , many bonds held it together . Hebrew , Greek , and Roman families in-their optimum phases were ' united by religious , economic , legal , and educational bonds . Each was a patriarchal family in which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These family structures have been widely criticized because of the inferior position of women and children ; yet in all cases this was probably a formal type of inferiority and in practice considerably modified by religion and sentiment . In all cases there was a fixing of responsibility upon the father to beget children ; to rear them in accordance with cultural demands , instilling in them contemporary virtues ; to provide for them economically ; and to assist their future occupational , religious , and marital adjustment . Furthermore , the authority of the father was restrained by public opinion and religious law . The father acted more as a trustee than as an absolute monarch . No doubt abuses occurred and fathers sometimes became dictators . Such abuses should not be used to repudiate the patriarchal family any more than disorganization in family life today should be indicted as the inevitable consequence of a democratic family . Against the contemporary frame of reference , a patriarchal family appears tyrannical , yet it must be admitted that these // historic families , mainly rural , did wax strong under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three types of family under discussion during their stable periods is the tremendous influence of religion , whether it is Judaism or paganism . The status and role of the father in each case were influenced by his priestly office . This relation appears most strikingly in the Hebrew family , but it also existed to some extent in the early Greek family and quite importantly in the early Roman family . The father 's status is not contingent merely upon natural circumstances but is bolstered by beliefs in a supernatural power with whom the father deals in religious observances . In addition , religion is a function of the primary group , enacted within the home where all see and participate in religious ceremonial . In the pagan home are the domestic gods , and in the Hebrew home prayers , fasts , purification rites . Religion is also a system of values exhibited in the fostering of certain virtues which parents have an obligation to instill by precept and example . Thus there is added to , and closely allied with , religion the educational function of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , education in these families was not merely acquisition of knowledge but acquisition of a way of life . Compared with modern education , it was simple , but it involved a motivation fostered by religious and familial ideals . Second , education was imparted directly by the parents , not through the medium of slaves or secondary groups , such as the school . Furthermore , these precepts had to be enacted daily in front of children so that the roles of fathers and mothers , husbands and wives , were not mysteries with which young people experimented after marriage or solved from reading . Tradition . A third factor also worth consideration was family tradition . In the Hebrew culture there was a pride that the family name should not die out in Israel . In both Greek and Roman cultures the concept of gens or great family existed . Ancestor worship or honor was part of religion . Thus , // family honor became a factor in life . Individualism had to be sacrificed to the family . A member had to think in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no existence without a family connection unless he were an exile . This last , in fact , was one of the punishments meted out by families to erring members . There are also negative factors , besides the possible abuses . Exposure of children , divorce , polygamy , cruel punishments were all acceptable practices in these cultures . None of these families was an " ideal " family . The main point is that they were strong families , social institutions that probably satisfied the needs of the people of that period . They were sacred societies existing against a background of stable cultures . The Greek and Roman families , however , were unable to continue against the background of social change and ultimately suffered a breakdown in their efforts to adapt . The Hebrew family unit , although changed , managed to persist much longer , and in fact it still exists in modified form . The importance of these families to the student is that they provide a knowledge of the structures and functions existing in strong family systems . With certain limitations the disintegration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families carries some lessons to students of family life . However , such comparisons should be made with great caution . The obvious similarities between the Roman family of the later period and the modern American family should not blind the student to the fact that the two cultures are widely different and the contrasts should be as effectively emphasized as the comparisons . COMING OF CHRISTIANITY As the Roman Empire began to disintegrate a new force arose to challenge the world ? Christianity . Its effect on the family was tremendous , and it remained unchallenged in this sphere in the Western world until recent times . Many writers are critical of the attitudes taken by the early Church Fathers toward marriage . This attitude was undoubtedly partly due // to the state of marriage in the decadent days of Rome . Christianity in the person of Jesus Christ , its founder , raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament , and , indeed , Saint Paul refers to marriage as a " great sacrament . " The patriarchal idea is softened by the words of Paul : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , and delivered Himself up for it , that He might sanctify it , cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life . . . . so also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself . " Another change in marriage that resulted from Christianity was the revised stand on adultery . Purity is considered a virtue , and both husband and wife are commanded to be faithful ; thus , the double standard of morality is denied . Exposure of children and selling them into slavery were condemned by the Church , and as Church influence grew , such Church laws became state laws under Christian emperors . Abortions were likewise forbidden . In A.D. 374 the Christian Emperor Valentinian declared infanticide a crime punishable by death and enforced the statute . 18 Legislation against selling children into slavery was less successful , even though the Church opposed the practice . Absolute divorce , that is , divorce with the right to remarry , and polygamy were likewise prohibited . The influence of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman families on contemporary culture . For centuries the Christian Church carefully regulated marriage and family life . Until the time of Martin Luther marriage had been considered indissoluble in Christian society because of its sacramental character . Luther 's influence in reducing marriage to a civil contract was one of the factors opening the way for divorce , the full implications of which are only now reaching society . Monogamy is still part of the legal code , although some writers in recent times have advocated polygyny . Infanticide is forbidden by law , but some states now permit certain types of abortions as well as birth control , although these are forbidden by Catholicism . Chapter 3 Social Change The term social change has displaced older terms , such as progress or social evolution , because it is less of a value judgment . Evolution and progress both appear to indicate a unilinear movement toward a superior stage of life , but facts are not always in keeping with such judgments . Social change is a descriptive term indicating alterations in the manner of doing and thinking and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . 1 Others make a distinction , restricting social change to personal relationships and cultural change to the impersonal aspects of life . 2 In this sense , this chapter deals mainly with cultural change , and the following one with social change , although such a rigid distinction is almost impossible and in practice the terms have become practically identical . Certain periods of history have been characterized by tremendous changes in all areas of life ? the declining days of Rome , the Renaissance , the Industrial Revolution , and the last few decades in the United States . The present period is one of transition in which alterations in the material culture far outnumber those in the nonmaterial , and in which the rate of change has been extremely swift . But change alone is not the problem of contemporary society , but rather the rapid rate of change . People living in such a period react differently : to some it means confusion , and they seek clarity in a return to the old way of life ; whereas to others it is an exciting opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is new because it is new and quickly discarding the old 36 // because it is old . To all it is a challenge , to be met only through an adaptability that permits them to accept what is desirable in the new without discarding lightly the necessary essentials of the old . Various indices of social change have been employed . Professor Bossard has used inventions , concluding that the rate of inventions and the rate of social change vary similarly . 3 William Fielding Ogburn also used mechanical inventions as a yardstick of social change , but added to it the resistance of society to such a change , which he termed cultural lag . 4 Pitirim Sorokin explained social change in terms of three cycles , the ideational , the idealistic , and the sensate. 5 In this book social changes will be examined in terms of social institutions with specific reference to the influence of these ) changes on the American family . Since social institutions are interrelated and interdependent , changes in one institution are almost certain to be reflected in changes in other institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social institutions . Perhaps the period under study here is too short to verify this supposition , although Sorokin 's work , covering a much longer period of time , seems to imply its existence . 6 On the descriptive level at least , the following appears to be true . About a century ago religion and the family seemed to have been more influential in the United States than they are today . After the Civil War , economic institutions assumed greater importance than they had had in the past and , in fact , appear to have been the tail that wagged the dog . Toward the turn of the century a reaction set in that resulted in " trust busting . " Then came the New Deal , and government as a social institution was enlarged in scope and power . Shortly afterward what may be considered a relatively new type of social institution , the contemporary labor union , began to gain influence . In a sense labor unions , at least the larger ones , are hybrid institutions , partly economic and partly political . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet undetermined . At the same time that these changes // were occurring , education , as a social institution , was becoming more powerful . Such power was indicated by the increase of free public education both on the elementary and secondary level , compulsory school-attendance laws , and greater numbers of teaching and student personnel . A great deal of this education was provided by the state , in contrast to the past when private institutions provided most of the educational facilities that existed . According to present trends , education , as a separate social institution , may soon lose its identity to the state , and be merely another service provided by this gargantuan institution . At any rate the changes in some of these important social institutions will be briefly sketched . ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS The industrial revolution did not reach America in any force until after the Civil War . This revolution in industry generally meant the application of steam power , and later electric power , through machines and the factory system to the production of goods . Its actual meaning , however , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic and political power from the landed aristocracy to the emerging industrialists and financiers , the rise of urbanism , as the United States changed from an agricultural to a manufacturing nation , the embodiment of laissez-faire philosophy in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , heavy immigration to provide cheap labor , and tremendous expansion of the country . This is the period sometimes referred to as that of the robber barons when economic institutions practically dominated all other institutions . Associated with this era were the acquisition of quick wealth by unscrupulous means and the conviction that money was the criterion of success in American life . Among the rapidly developing industries , steel , oil , and meat packing were outstanding . The invention of the Bessemer furnace radically decreased both the cost and the time required for manufacturing steel . Within a twenty-year peSocial // riod beginning about 186o the number of steel and iron plants more than doubled , and employees of such plants increased from 22,000 to 141,000 . Expansion of the railroads to the West and refrigeration made the meat-packing industry possible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that oil might be used for lubrication and lighting , and this soon developed into an important industry in which great fortunes were made . 7 Hand in hand with this development of industry went several inventions that made rapid communication possible . In addition to the railroad there were the telegraph , later the telephone and automobile , and more recently radio and television . Most of these inventions or discoveries resulted in the formation of huge companies , and finance capitalism developed . Large cities became the nerve centers of finance capitalism and drew thousands of persons from rural areas to staff offices and factories . About the same time an agricultural revolution was occurring , resulting in the mechanization of the farm . This made it possible for fewer farm workers to supply food for larger numbers of urban dwellers , and at the same time compelled many young men and women to leave the farm where they were not needed . Mobility , both horizontal and vertical , has become more common as a result of industrialization and urbanization . Horizontal mobility refers to physical change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plant found that 78 per cent of the residents of certain New Jersey suburbs had changed their addresses in five years . In Westchester County , New York , 74 per cent of the suburban families had lived at their present addresses less than two years in 1934. 8 Vertical mobility means movements upward or downward in the social scale and has already been referred to . One aspect of the application of electricity to the home was the lessening of household work . Electric irons , washing machines , vacuum cleaners , waffle irons , and improved lighting have made the housewife 's tasks easier . At the same time certain service agencies began to assume former household // tasks . The per capita production of commercial bakeries increased 27 per cent between 1919 and 1929 ; until 1920 restaurants increased three times as rapidly as the population . Commercial laundries also became more numerous , although modern laundering equipment tended to keep this task within the home . 9 Following the Civil War , immigration showed an increase , reaching its peak in the first decade of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the new immigration . Cheap land in the West was gone and they settled mainly in large cities on the eastern seaboard . Here they filled the slum areas and tenements , often living in poverty and congestion ( in Little Italys or Little Polands ) which made their accommodation or assimilation to American life difficult . However , they supplied cheap labor and for this reason were not only welcomed but actually sought by some industrialists . As industry and finance capitalism gained power in America the government almost became one of their paid agents . Such was the situation that Edward H. Harriman is reputed to have said that if he wanted state legislation he could buy it and if necessary could buy Congress and the Judiciary . 10 The Fourteenth Amendment , intended to protect the civil rights of Negroes in the South , actually proved a potent weapon in the interests of big business , freeing it in some cases from control by state legislatures The fever to get rich quickly and the tendency to judge success by wealth alone seemed to permeate the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Through all the grades I see the all-pervading , all-engrossing anxiety to grow rich . That is the only thing for which men live here . " 11 Some of the effects of the industrial and agrarian revolution appear to have been the raising of the standard of living for some , a rapid increase in large cities with their slum areas and tenements , increased vertical and horizontal mobility , and a spirit of rank materialism , placing undue emphasis on // money and tolerating almost any method of acquiring wealth , no matter how unscrupulous . GOVERNMENT Government institutions were more or less subservient to economic institutions until about the turn of the century . As a result in part of the work of the " muckrakers , " many of the then current abuses were brought to the attention of the public and President Theodore Roosevelt became personally interested in the exposures of Lincoln Steffens . Some reforms resulted , such as the Pure Food and Drug Act , the Meat Inspection Act , and reforms in life insurance and advertising . The Taft and Wilson administrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn of the century until the return to normalcy under Warren G. Harding , the government attempted to control large trusts , provide compensation for workingmen , limit the working hours and employment conditions of women and children , set up a Children 's Bureau in the newly created Department of Labor , enfranchize women , and in general begin a curtailment of the abuses characteristic of the late nineteenth century . The depression of the thirties and the election of Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal program , however , placed governmental institutions in first place . It is impossible here to list all legislation of this period , but the general trend was increasing control of many aspects of life by government . Hours , wages , and working conditions of almost all employees , not only women and children , now became a full time concern of the federal government . While controls over business increased , governmental assistance was likewise extended to business . Labor unions began to assume the proportions of a social institution under the blessing of the Roosevelt administration . Federal relief was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for the education of youth , social security and old age pensions were set up . Some of this legislation was merely temporary , but the long42 Social Change time trend was unmistakable . The Truman administration has proposed even greater extensions of governmental powers in a national health program and federal aid to education . The Second World War , of course , represented the apex of government control , some of which still remains . Critics are divided in their opinions of the increasing role of government . Some view it as the shadow of socialism , but others hail it as the salvation of the common man . Be that as it may , government as a social institution is today more comprehensive and powerful than at any time in American history , with the exception of war periods . This power may prove quite significant in the future of the American family . EDUCATION Education , as a social institution in the United States , at least in the form of schools , owes its origin and development to religion and the state . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Massachusetts Bay Colony , when a law was passed requiring every town of 5o inhabitants to appoint a teacher and pay his salary . The reason for this formal instruction was to enable people to read the scriptures . 12 The first colleges founded in the United States were established to train students for the ministry . The Northwest Ordinance and the Morrill Act of 1862 provided free land for colleges . By 185o free public-school education in the United States had increased notably , and 8o per cent of the population was compelled to undergo some primary schooling . 13 Between 187o and 1900 the number of pupils in public schools increased from 7 million to 151/2 million . Illiteracy decreased from 17 per cent in 188o to 11 per cent in 1900 . Free education was being extended beyond grammar school , the school term was being lengthened , and compulsory school laws were being enforced . 14 The First Provincial Council of Baltimore held in 1829 recommended the establishment of Catholic schools wherever // possible , and by that date at least one Catholic school had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and too poor at that time to support any extensive parochial system of education . By 1840 , however , controversies over the reading of the Protestant version of the Bible in public schools , the use of anti-Catholic textbooks , and discriminations practiced toward Catholic teachers and students hastened the establishment of a Catholic parochial school system . In 1864 Pope Pius IX urged attendance of American parochial schools by Catholic children . In 1950 there were 4,750,956 children under some form of Catholic instruction . Catholic universities and colleges had a total enrollment of 252,727 ; parish and diocesan high schools , 324,398 ; private high schools , 195,480 ; elementary parish schools , 2,477,741 ; private elementary schools , 82,885 ; protective institutions , 14,794 ; and public-school children attending religious classes numbered 1,360,123. 15 Not only was education extended in the United States , but there was a gradual change in the curriculum and methods . Latin and Greek gave way to social science , home economics , and vocational courses as the philosophy of education changed . This change was especially noticeable on the secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparatory schools for colleges ; now for very many they have become terminal educational institutions . While the first public education in America had been initiated so that people might read the scriptures , and higher education had been established to train theological students , public education today has practically dropped religion from its curriculum . A recent decision of the United States Supreme Court now makes it doubtful that public school buildings can be used for religious instruction even after school hours . 16 One of the most important factors behind this change of attitude toward religion has been the development of physical and social science . The theory of evolution as set forth by Spencer and Darwin has played havoc with fundamentalist // religion . The Armageddon of this struggle was reached in Dayton , Tennessee , in the famous Scopes trial , where an instructor was placed on trial for having taught the theory of evolution contrary to state law . This trial was a farce , typical of other such phenomena during the twenties , but probably harmed the causes of both religion and science . Changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extended upward and downward . Extracurricular activities may extend two or three hours after class or into the night and on Saturdays . Kindergarten and nursery schools now claim many children under five or six , and graduate schools , requiring a degree for entrance , may prolong education until the age of twenty-six or more . More and more the school is carrying on functions formerly the prerogative of parents . Present trends appear to indicate that while religion and the state were both responsible and mutually helpful in originating and developing free education in this country , the state is about to dissolve the partnership . Such indications are seen in organizations like Protestants and Other Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , the recent action of the National Educational Association in opposing use of free school buses or free school lunches for children in church schools , and the projected bill for federal aid to education . American Catholics support two school systems , one of which a very large number of them do not use . Catholics support their own schools because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the formal education of every Catholic child . The same is true of certain other religious groups in the United States with respect to their religions . Federal aid to education could spell the end of private education in this country , an important factor in a world where the state is increasingly becoming a leviathan. // RELIGION Religion in the most simple terms is the tie that binds man to God . As a social institution it is the ways and means by which the human need to know , to love , to serve , and to worship a Supreme Being are satisfied . As a social institution in the United States , religion consists of over 250 different denominations and sects . Such a variety of creeds might lead one to believe that every American could find some type of church that might appeal to him . The facts , however , show that about 50 per cent of the persons in the United States thirteen years of age or more have no religious affiliation at all . 17 In 1940-1941 total church membership in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of churches has not increased in proportion to the increase of the population . 19 In relation to the country 's population the number of clergymen is likewise decreasing , but religious , charity , and social welfare workers are increasing . In 1goo there were 1,773 persons graduated from seminaries in the United States , but only 1,357 in 1926. 20 Part ; but not all , of this may be explained by increasing urbanism , where one large church may accommodate as many members as three or four small rural churches formerly did . Yet between 1926 and 1940-1941 many religious denominations showed an increase in membership . Lutheran bodies increased 26.5 per cent ; Adventist bodies , 52.4 per cent ; Methodists 19.0 per cent ; Churches of God , 197.9 per cent ; Jewish Congregations , 13.7 per cent , and Roman Catholics , 23.3 per cent . 21 Many other churches also showed an increase in membership . Since the population of the United States was increasing at the same time , an increase in church membership was to be expected . This report should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily an index of religious practice . It seems apparent that the influence of religion in our society is declining . This decline is most noticeable in Protestant , urban groups . 22 There were 27,766,141 Catholics in the United States , // Alaska , and Hawaii in 1950 , an increase of over i million Catholics in a year . Of this number 119,173 were converts . There were 42,970 priests , the largest number in history . In comparing these statistics with those of Protestant denominations , however , an allowance must be made for the fact that Protestant bodies generally do not include children under thirteen years of age as church members . 23 Despite these encouraging statistics , there have been some changes in the meaning of the term religion among some Protestant churchmen . A questionnaire study conducted by George Herbert Betts , " The Beliefs of Seven Hundred Ministers , " showed that of 500 ministers only 71 per cent believed in the virgin birth ; 84 per cent believed that Christ really rose from the dead ; only 6o per cent believed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the traditional beliefs of Protestantism when the responses of 200 theological students were compared with those of the ministers . While 6o per cent of the ministers believed in the devil as an actual person , only 8 per cent of the students held such a belief , and 55 per cent of the ministers but only 8 per cent of the students held that the Bible was written by man under divine inspiration . Although 62 per cent of the ministers believed in the resurrection of the body , only 18 per cent of the students concurred in this belief . 24 Such differences of opinion reflect the tremendous chasm between Protestant Fundamentalists and Protestant Modernists . The former took a literal interpretation of the Bible and now find it difficult to reconcile with modern biology , anthropology , astronomy , and other physical and social sciences . The latter took a free interpretation of the Bible , in the sense that each individual might draw his own meanings , and so , logically speaking , one should not expect universal agreement among Protestants even of the same denomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary life threaten religion . One of the most potent is urban life , and , as noted above , this hurts Protestantism most keenly . If religion is robbed of its supernatural elements , it Ili // becomes merely a matter of good fellowship , of sociability . In promoting sociability , religion is a poor second to many commercialized forms of recreation . In rural areas people may look to the church as a place where they can meet on Sunday , but urban people are less isolated and can and do meet easily at many other social activities on Sunday as well as on other days . Clergymen of all denominations are finding their spheres of influence shrinking in a modern , specialized world . A century ago among Irish Catholics a priest was frequently the only educated person . As such he was not only an administrator of the Sacraments , but a legal , political , and economic advisor to his people . The priest was frequently called upon to read and write letters , to locate lost relatives in Ireland , and he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at times a physician , and certainly a psychiatrist to many . As a result of such multiple role playing , the priest became the supreme authority and final arbiter of questions far removed from religion or moral law . Today psychiatry , social work , marriage councils , and other professional or social agencies perform work formerly carried on by parish priests . In the Roman Catholic Church certain congregations of nuns devote themselves almost exclusively to social work , and many dioceses have their Catholic Charities directed by a priest . Despite this , however , secular organizations make increasing inroads on the Catholic population . Many Catholic children attend public schools and nonCatholic colleges and universities . The work of some , but by no means all or even most , psychiatrists is inimical to religion . Yet some Catholics come under the care of areligious psychiatrists . Some 700 birth-control clinics , or maternal health clinics , frequently an euphonious title for the former , exist and claim the patronage of some nominal Catholics . Marriage counseling in particular threatens to become the function of secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The basic problem is that in this age of specializa48 Social Change tion all priests are not trained to carry on highly specialized functions in addition to the one for which they have been trained , the priesthood . It is quite apparent that Catholic laity must share this burden which priests and religious have heroically borne alone for years . Here is a field for Catholic Action not yet adequately exploited . Materialism , characteristic of contemporary urban society and already noted under economic institutions , threatens religion . Some critics feel that organized religion has neglected the commonplace problems of life , especially in the case of the workingman . This is less true of the Catholic Church than it is of some other religious denominations . Pope Leo 's encyclical , " Rerum Novarum , " written as early as 1891 , is a proof that Catholicism , officially at least , took cognizance of this problem . The work of Jesuits and others in Institutes of Industrial Relations , such as the school administered by Reverend Dennis J. Comey , S.J. , in Philadelphia , is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and workingmen . Nor has the Catholic Church neglected race relations , another problem of contemporary life , as the work of Baroness D'Orzy in Friendship House in Harlem indicates , to cite one example . One of the real difficulties in all of the Church 's attempts to work for social reform has been the apathy and indifference of some leaders and many laity . Catholics living in a materialistic world do not remain uninfected by this current pathology . Like schools , churches frequently become the whipping boys for all that is wrong with society . At the same time that churches are berated for failing to change society , they are sharply reprimanded if they dare to raise their voices or worse still carry even suggestions to legislatures . Thus , the churches are criticized for failure to influence and criticized for being power-hungry if they attempt to influence . The role of the church today is apparently supposed to be limited to a few pious platitudes delivered to those who care to attend and served up as briefly and as painlessly as possible . The declining prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // been the bulwark of the family , certainly leaves the family more vulnerable to the inroads of secularism . THE CHANGING FAMILY How have these changes in other social institutions affected the family ? One of the most obvious factors changing American family life is urbanism . In 1920 , for the first time in the history of the United States , more persons resided in what the Census terms urban areas than in rural areas . As a result of this transition the family as an economic producing unit just about disappeared in cities . Clothes are seldom made at home , and the canning industry largely displaced preserving of fruits and vegetables by housewives . More meals were eaten in restaurants , commercialized recreation replaced the home brand familiar on the farm . Married women working outside the home increased from 1 in 22 in 1890 to 1 in 5 in 1940. 25 Houses became smaller and apartment house living more common . In 1947 there were more four- and five-room dwelling units than any other size . Houses and apartments of this size accounted for 42 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 per cent of the total . 26 With a decrease in the amount of living space and a wife employed outside the home , children present a serious problem . Urban children are apt to constitute economic liabilities since , unlike farm children , they rarely perform chores which contribute to family income . This is even more true when compulsory school laws make it impossible for children to become wage earners till fourteen or sixteen years of age , depending on local laws . When a society is permeated with materialism and measures success by wealth , the number of economic liabilities willingly assumed is apt to be small . For this and other reasons the birth rate has dropped and , except for short spurts following wars , will probably continue to drop . In 1870 there were about 37 births per 1,000 persons in the population , in the mid thirties this had dropped to 17 , and in 1942 had risen to almost 21 births per 1,000 persons . // Between 185o and 1940 the number of unbroken families which had no children living at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased from 28 to 31 per cent of all unbroken families . 27 Burgess and Locke have expressed the attitudes of many married couples very well in the following statement : The standard of living , especially in the city , becomes one that is planned , and a baby is " budgeted " much the same as an electric refrigerator , a radio and an automobile . Significantly , with the modern couple each of these commodities generally has priority over a baby . 28 The small urban home or apartment not only excludes children but likewise aged parents or relatives . It has been said , for instance , that the absence of a spare bedroom is the best defense against a host of invading relatives . The popularity of the kitchenette apartment , and of two and three room units as against the larger dwellings attests to the changing structure of the urban family . 29 Social security and old age pensions have eased the economic problems of impoverished parents , at least for sons and daughters , but it has by no means solved the psychological problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of laissez faire , or rugged individualism , noted in economic institutions and written into the constitution in the Fourteenth Amendment , has manifested itself in family life . Freedom to choose one 's mate without family intervention has become increasingly common in American middle-class families . Within marriage itself a spirit of individualism exists . Part of this is certainly due to the intense emphasis on the contractual rather than the sacramental aspects of marriage . One enters into a business contract in the hope of financial gain for oneself ; one enters into marriage in the hope of personal happiness for oneself . When expected benefits fail to materialize in a business or marriage contract , it is terminated if legally possible . All states today make the termination of the marriage contract possible under conditions that vary from state to state . // Absolute divorce , which means the end of the marital contract with the right of both parties to remarry , has gained by leaps and bounds in the United States . In 1867 , the first year in which divorce statistics were collected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 the estimate was 405,000 . In 1945 there was a ratio of one divorce for almost every three marriages in that year . If the present rate continues , it is estimated that in the not too distant future there could be one divorce for every marriage . 30 Divorce will be treated in detail later , but it is necessary to indicate here that divorce laws are scarcely the cause of divorce , although they do facilitate it . The lessening of religious influence , growing individualism , and the economic independence of women are some of the factors involved . The growing power of government has made an impact on the family through marital legislation , a great deal of which is beneficial . One example is laws requiring premarital blood tests for the detection of venereal disease . Today these laws exist in about 35 states . 31 Most states have set up legal requirements for some or all of the following : age at marriage , marriage license , blood tests in pregnancy , and waiting periods between the issuance of a marriage license and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to marriage and divorce legislation . The Family and Education . Compulsory school laws have shifted the responsibility of education from the home to a secondary group agency . In this contemporary , complex , and highly specialized society , most parents have neither the time nor skill to carry on educational functions to the degree required . It seems , however , that parents tend to overlook one important fact . Schools occupy the children of our society for a major period of each day during most of their childhood and adolescence . Families , however , have children during the most formative period before they enter even nursery school . They likewise have children during all of the time they are not in school , or at least are generally responsible for them . Children do not wait to form attitudes until they enter a // nursery school , kindergarten , or first grade . In fact they may reach school with certain attitudes rather definitely established . Personality patterns likewise appear to be fairly well formed before school age . What schools can do with children is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of children they receive . Furthermore , unless school learning is supported by the family , it is largely futile . If children learn in the classroom to respect persons of other races and creeds , for instance , but in the home such ideas are ridiculed , it is not likely that the child will accept them . The play group performs a similar function . Both of these are primary groups , while the school , for the most part , is a secondary group . The former are much more important and pervasive in their influence on individuals . Schools simply can not entirely replace the home as agencies of education , but today education as a social institution has lulled some parents into a false sense of security in this respect or provided a rationalization by which some parents dodge their fundamental obligations in child rearing . Schools may also act as agencies to create marginal personalities . The public schools of America are pre-eminently middle-class institutions . Children from upper- or lowerclass homes may find official attitudes and policies of school teachers or administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly true of immigrants ' children . Such children may become bicultural , utilizing the privileges of each culture and avoiding whenever possible the responsibilities of both cultures . Areligious schools present another problem to the child from a religious home . If God and religion have been made the cornerstone of life in the home , the child soon becomes aware that such a system of values has no place in the classroom . Puzzling bewilderment may follow with a tendency to reject all authority , since authorities do not agree . This crisis is likely to be more common among religiously reared children who attend schools or colleges which are not merely areligious but antireligious . If educaSocial // t ion is anything , it should be consistent . Schools and homes should reflect insofar as possible the same basic system of values , unless , of course , the home is antisocial or immoral . It has long been recognized that all children could not profit from the traditional type of education provided in the classical curriculum . This has stemmed from a knowledge of differences in intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious homes will profit from areligious or antireligious education any more than a person with only mechanical aptitudes would profit from a graduate course in Greek . The latter might merely be bored ; the religious person , on the other hand , exposed to a system of education which neglects or attacks his system of values , may become a psychological misfit . It seems ironic that schools which claim to educate for life , insist on omitting from their curricula one of the most important aspects of life , religion . Even though education has become specialized and complex to such an extent that parents can not carry on certain aspects of it , they do have the right to be consulted regarding educational policies to which their children are exposed . One does not require a doctor of philosophy degree from a school of education to be articulate about his system of values . Religious Institutions and the Family . The diminished influence of religious institutions in contemporary life has notable meanings for the family . The fact that Martin Luther rejected the sacramental character of marriage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . This has certainly been a factor in decreasing the permanency of married life . Religion has traditionally been a bond further cementing family relationships . This bond has been increasingly relaxed in modern times despite the fact that scientific studies predicting success in marriage found ? religion a factor that made for happiness . 32 Religious exercises in the family itself have diminished . One of the White House Conferences investigated four types of religious activity in the family ; church attendance , grace at meals , group Bible reading and prayers and devotions . Only 40 per cent of urban families // participated in church attendance ; io per cent of urban families read the Bible in common , and 3o per cent said grace at meals . 33 Although no statistics are available , it is generally believed that family recitation of the Rosary , common in the past among Catholic families , has greatly decreased . Holy pictures formerly hung in living rooms of Catholic families are less frequent today . Some changes are occurring which may make religious exercises a family affair . Attendance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain advantages , may be outweighed by family attendance at the same Mass . Some recently erected churches provide soundproof rooms with windows where mothers or fathers can " hear " Mass while their infants and younger children accompany them . The great advantage of such changes is that it makes religious worship a common family experience , and children can observe their parents at prayer , Mass , and the Sacraments . Thus they learn at first hand by observation and precept the meaning of religious participation . This also places more responsibility upon parents for religious instruction since children ask questions about what they see and hear . Family religion may also increase children 's identification with parents and heighten their sense of security . 34 In the Catholic marriage ceremony the word sacrifice is used . The writer at one time used this term in a course on the family in a nonsectarian university . Students expressed surprise that marriage should be thought of in such a term . Here is another contribution religion makes to family life . Marriage and the family both require sacrifices on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children . The modern concept of romantic love envisions a life of perpetual happiness . Yet no life could ever be so , and the emphasis on sacrifice in marriage at least makes persons aware of it , and is a test of true love versus the romantic fraud . Religion is certainly more realistic in its approach in this case than many motion pictures , novels , and other media which strongly influSocial // ence young persons in the choice of a mate and in their ideas on married life . Decline of religious values has made people less willing to accept the responsibilities of married life , particularly in the form of children . The Roman Catholic Church stands almost alone today in rejecting artificial contraception . Yet a poll by Fortune Magazine , if correct , showed that 6g per cent of Catholic women polled believed such information should be made available to all married women . Among Catholic college women 84.9 per cent believed such information should be made available . This does not indicate that such women practice birth control or advocate it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not to be used . Unquestionably the issue of birth control in the form of artificial contraception is one of the most difficult that Catholic couples face today . Living in world in which religious values are challenged and where such a practice is common , only strong supernatural motives enable them to adhere to the Church 's teaching on this matter . As a result of changes in the various social institutions , the family has lost more and more of its functions . Contemporary economic life has taken its productive functions and removed the wife and mother from the home in increasing numbers ; education has claimed the child earlier , retained him longer , and bit by bit almost replaced the home with regard to educational functions ; government has provided for the care of the aged by pensions of one sort or the other ; urbanism has made children economic liabilities and penalized families with children by often refusing them rented living space ; religion has been unable to persuade families to retain their traditional functions of begetting and rearing children or to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urban Protestant families , or urban families of no religion than of Catholic families . It is less true of all rural families . What functions are still left to urban families ? The family is still an important primary group in which love and affection are shared among its members . It still is the most impor56 Social Change tant agency in shaping personality patterns of children . It is still the best hope of a better world . Today there is a growing concern over family relationships . If the various social institutions which have been directly or indirectly responsible for current changes in the family were organized to promote a more stable family , and if adequate education were provided for family living and parenthood , it would be possible to develop a strong family life . This new type of strong family life will not be identical with the former family , but it will carry on those family functions most essential to healthy family living and vital to America . This point will be discussed more fully in the last chapter . Chapter 4 Changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt was made to examine the impact of cultural change upon the family as a social institution . It appears that the number of family functions is decreasing as they are taken over by , or surrendered to , other institutions . It is now necessary to examine this from the viewpoint of social relationships within the family . What has this loss of family functions , traditional in American society , meant to husbands and wives , fathers and mothers ? Here this question will be analyzed in terms of roles . Role has been defined as the dynamic aspect of status . 1 The meaning of the term status has not yet been adequately clarified in sociology , but here Linton 's definition is used : a collection of rights and duties . 2 Actually it is impossible to separate the two , and , as Linton points out , the distinction is only of academic interest . 3 Cottrell uses the term role and distinguishes between social roles and unique roles . The former represents " a modal pattern expected in a given cultural or subcultural group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or the interpretation of the social role by an individual . 4 Thus the term status as used by Linton and the term social role as used by Cottrell appear to mean about the same thing , that is , established norms against which individuals carry out their unique roles . The term unique refers to the fact that no two individuals are identical , and in the interpretation of their roles some private definitions enter the picture . Merrill affords the following explanation : 59 6o Changing Familial Roles in Contemporary Society Certain functions are performed in every marriage by husband and wife acting out individual variations of the traditional roles . Some husbands may regularly do the shopping , take an active interest in cooking , and clean the house . Others may act as though they were permanent guests at a moderately well-run hotel , where they are merely called upon to pay the bills and appear for meals with reasonable regularity . In some households , emptying the ashtrays may constitute the entire male contributions to the domestic economy , whereas in others he may act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard cultural roles occur in every marriage . 5 Rapid social change has altered the traditional cultural roles of husbands and wives , fathers and mothers in this society . " The traditional expectations linger on in the cultural role , which is often at variance with actual behavior. " 6 " Strong emotional overtones are present in the adult manifestations of marital roles . When the individual is unable to play the role expected of him , frustration and conflict may result . " 7 Furthermore , roles of fathers and mothers , of husbands and wives , may involve sentiment , since they are usually acquired first within their own families and overlaid with nostalgic memories . For this reason they tend to resist change . When change is inevitable , as it is , some individuals in confusion and conflict surrender traditional cultural roles without any adequate definition of the roles to be assumed in their place . This is the case in some contemporary families , and perhaps to some extent in almost all contemporary , urban , middle-class families . Again , as in Chapter i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting to social change without sloughing off those functions essential to adequate family living . This chapter tries to spell out in some detail variations in familial roles resulting from , and contributing to , rapid social change . THE ROLES OF FATHER AND MOTHER Roles of fathers and mothers in our society a century and a half ago were a mixture of residues from parental roles in Changing Familial Roles in Contemporary Society 6i western European society and particularly from colonial American families . Family relationships were of a distinctly bourgeois type with strong overtones of a property institution . The background of such family relationships was Protestant with considerable Puritan influences . 8 Calhoun believes that early individualism in America was really familial . Pioneer conditions forced the family to become self-sufficient economically , politically , educationally , and religiously . Under these circumstances it is not strange that the strongest member of the family , in terms of physical strength , should emerge as the head . This was the male . Thus , conditions in the new world reinforced the patriarchal tradition of the western European family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries had resulted in the most powerful sanctions the mores could provide . The whole concept of family welfare became so identified with the father that it was heresy to question it . Meade Minnigerode , speaking of the father 's role as late as 1840 said , Home is the palace of the husband and father . He is the monarch of that little empire , wearing a crown that is the gift of Heaven , swaying a scepter put into his hands by the Father of all , acknowledging no superior , fearing no rival and dreading no usurper. 9 " There emerged from this established position of the male two correlative facts ; that the status of other members was unequivocally fixed and that the duties of other members could clearly be defined in relation to it . " 10 The mother 's role was distinctly one of subordination . Reverend J. N. Danforth in The Token of Friendship , of Home , the Center of Affections , published in Boston in 1841 , wrote : The Father gives his kind command , The Mother joins , approves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves . 11 The wife was to be subject to her husband in all things , although it was understood that he " giveth over his right unto // his wife to see to those things that belong unto the kitchen and to housewiferie , and to their household stuffe. " 12 To such an extent was the above true that Calhoun states when Governor Winthrop 's wife lost her mind , her Puritan women friends attributed the calamity to her desertion of her domestic duties and meddling in man 's sphere . 13 The subordination of women was reflected in the laws prevailing in the nineteenth century . The husband had entire legal right to the person of his wife and could use gentle means to constrain her liberty . He had the sole right to the remedies of legal wrongs done to her person . The woman could not sue alone , and she lost complete control over her property as long as the marriage continued . The husband acquired at the moment of marriage all the personal property of his wife , such as money , goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of it , and at his death the properties went to his representatives as being entirely his own . 14 While many illustrations have been drawn from a period earlier than a century and a half ago , the customs still held true in the nineteenth century , although the seeds of change had been sown and were rapidly developing . But in the last century , the father was a patriarch and his patriarchy was reinforced by the legal code of the day . Since patriarchy is a status , that is , a collection of rights and duties , it is appropriate to list some of the duties inherent in this status . The father in most cases was the breadwinner , not in the solitary sense that he is in many contemporary families , but with the responsibility resting in him of procuring money and directing its expenditure . Today the latter function is believed to be shared with or relinquished to the wife and children . In urban America of i 800 few women and children worked outside the home , although both worked hard within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and children the husband might support various unmarried females related by blood or marriage . The first census in 1790 showed that only 34.5 per cent of the private families consisted of four persons or less , while about 65.5 per cent consisted of // five or more persons . Some of these were servants or lodgers and other unrelated persons ; so it is impossible to be specific . Many , however , were undoubtedly unmarried , related females . In 1940 , 72.9 per cent of the American families consisted of four persons or less , while only 27.1 per cent had five or more persons . In this case the basis of enumeration was the " natural family . " 15 The father 's economic burden was not so heavy as might be supposed in the earlier American family , since many members contributed in terms of housework , care of the children , and other duties within the home . In his capacity as a patriarch the father exercised a religious function . Grace at meals and family devotions were common and usually were led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stern patriarch 's expelling from the home a wayward son or " fallen " daughter . In many cases the role of the father was a stern one . The mother 's role , as already indicated , was subordinate , especially outside the home . ' Within the household she performed many tasks that helped keep the family afloat economically , such as sewing , baking , cooking , cleaning , making soap , candles , and the like . She was a teacher and a nurse . It was her function to transmit household skills to her daughters , since schools above the elementary level were largely for boys and emphasized only a classical curriculum . 16 Hospitals did not exist to the extent they do today , and those in existence were not so widely used . In general , women of those days carried on the traditional functions of " Kinder , Kirche and Kuchen . " Their status is admirably expressed in the folk saying , " Husband and wife were one , but the husband was the one . " CHANGING ROLES OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture presented here . The family itself has shrunk during the last century in terms of size and functions . But the length of the day has . remained the same , and through decreased work64 Changing Familial Roles in Contemporary Society ing hours and the mechanization of the kitchen , more leisure time has been provided , so that the portrayal time for the roles of father and mother has been increased . This has presented a real difficulty . It is as though the producer of a play decided that it should run an hour longer but failed to get the playwright to add any lines . Neither fathers nor mothers have successfully solved this problem , but each has attacked it in his own way . Men have manufactured interests outside the home and identified them with the moral aspect of contemporary American life ? getting ahead in business . Some upper middle-class males find luncheon or dinner engagements with the Rotarians , Lions , Kiwanis , or other business or professional associations . Lower middle-class males rationalize their absences from home by union meetings , fraternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's club , the local tavern , with the boys . The necessity of rationalizing such absences from the home is based on the changed status of women . A century and a half ago father attended his lodge as religiously as people used to go to church . His right to do so was unquestioned . The rising matriarchy in the United States makes such explanations in order , and to be effective they must be oriented within the American mores of which women are the main creators and unique guardians . 17 American mores being what they are , there can be no higher appeal to morality than the indication that these matters are somehow involved with the profit motive . It is difficult to identify an evening in the tavern with the boys as part of getting ahead , but here class differences will explain it . The residues of the patriarchy are less diminished in the lower middle class than in the upper middle class , and the explanation consequently a little less necessary . The New Father Role . In most families of the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of extermination . For example , although empirical proof is lacking , it is not uncommon today to hear both parents addressed by their children by their first names rather // than by parental terms . This reflects in part the tendency of parents to address each other by given names rather than as father or mother , but it may also indicate that the formal term father , with its connotation of somewhat severe authority , has given way to a less formal or more affectionate type of address such as Dad , Daddy , Pops , or just plain John . The stern patriarchal type of father is practically nonexistent in the middle-class family . In his book The American People , Gorer may be close to the truth when he points up father rejection in American society . He says , " but to grow up like father , to do no better than he had done , to be the same sort of person he was , would be failure indeed and would be so regarded by the father as much as by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imitate father ; they expect to surpass him . As teacher and leader , father 's role has declined for a number of reasons . He can not exert his authority by force , because the mores forbid it . He can not exert it through knowledge , as farmers might have done a century ago , because the boy may be acquiring an education superior to his father 's . Even in such mundane matters as sex , the father may be hopelessly outclassed because of the rapidly changing folkways and mores . In fact , father and son may have difficulty communicating at all , since current slang expressions leave the father in some cases completely bewildered . Neither is it possible for father to exert power through threats of withholding the inheritance . Margaret Mead , in speaking of middle-class urban families said , Nor are married children expected to plan their lives in the expectation of ultimately inheriting from either set of parents-inlaw ; such inheritances when they come along are windfalls , good luck rather than something which may be properly looked forward to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is still one area left in which father could conveniently assert his authority and sometimes does . He can withhold allowances or the family car . However , he may be plagued by mother 's paraphrase of the most recent child // psychologist 's remarks on juvenile delinquency , lack of security , and so on . He is also overwhelmed by guilt feelings reminding him , " You were a boy once , " or by the fact that he is a miniature Hitler abusing his authority or what is left of it . This decline of paternal authority seems to have been going on for some time in the United States . In the last century Burns said , " Honor thy father and thy mother ' is a maxim which is little attended to in this land of liberty , and the injunction call no man master ' is fulfilled to the letter through the whole round of society . " 20 Gaillardet in 1883 declared , " the family which is a monarchy in the old world has become , like everything else , a republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is simply a president . " ( One is tempted to modify this further in the twentieth century and say that the father is merely a vice-president . ) Muirhead , who visited America in the early nineties , found the doctrine of the equality of man so rampant among children that " even the public authorities seem to recognize the inherent right of the American child to have his own way . " 21 America today is close to being a child-centered society , and in the absence of children there is a tendency toward feminocentric society . It represents in part a reaction against the patriarchy , and Americans being far from a middle-of-the-road people have gone to the opposite extreme . As the patriarchal function has been shorn from father and other functions not provided , he tends to escape into business . In 1912 a writer in the Paris Gaulois said that the American ruled in the business world , but his wife ruled everywhere else . 22 In 1894 Price Collier remarked that in England : The establishment home is carried on with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... of the woman . An Englishman is more at home in his own house than is an American . He leaves it later in the morning , returns to it earlier in the evening and gives more of himself to it than does the American . An Englishman is continually going home ; an American is continually going to business . 23 // The futility and helplessness of the father 's role in America are reflected with some exaggeration in radio plays and comic strips . " Blondie and Dagwood " is perhaps the best example . Here is presented the helpless , hopelessly befuddled American father who could not exist for twenty-four hours unless extricated from his muddles by his blonde wife or small children . Other examples are " Bringing Up Father , " where the husband 's role is that of paying bills and not asking questions , or the radio play , " Henry Aldrich . " The New Mother Role . As the patriarchy has declined in America , the matriarchy or feminocentric society has grown . Geoffrey Corer refers to the United States as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as " feminocratic. " 25 The twentieth century has not only multiplied potential roles for all women ; it has also divided the mother role into two possible portrayals . For example , one can be , according to advertisements , a part-time model and a fulltime mother . As the industrial revolution found its way into the home , it lightened women 's tasks , and with more time on their hands and less and less direction from fathers , it has become possible for mothers in America to enter new fields or at least to enter more fully into old fields . Some attempted one or the other , and a few have attempted both . It is at least debatable to what extent a woman may have a career and still be a full-time mother , other than in the biological sense ; so for the most part these " mothers " will be neglected . Attention will be focused on those who play the full-time mother role to the hilt . All human beings crave love and affection , and most seem to desire to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and psychiatrists have agreed . As the husband and father has left the home , mother has turned naturally ' to the children . If she remains at home , children may become the target of her love-starved life , although in other cases they may be completely rejected . This latter type of mother , however , is more apt to fall into the class of those who work outside the home . // The fact that the American mother has arrogated to herself , or has had thrust upon her , the dominant role in the rearing of children ? a role which is held by the father or shared by both parents , in most other societies , has far reaching results on the character of the children ; and since this situation is not a novel one , on the character of the adults . 26 There is no doubt that women spend more time with children than men do . In 1909 Mrs. Samuel McCune said that the suburban child was almost a fatherless child : 27 Since middle-class families probably make up about half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book . Burgess and Locke consider the suburban family a matricentric family and quote Lundberg 's study to the effect that there are zoo women to every 8o men in suburban towns . 28 If women do dominate the middle-class home , the role of mother in America may begin to approximate the matriarchal . Such a conclusion , however , is too naive . Children , for instance , do exert considerable influence . Both parental roles are , to some extent , shaped by children . Children are keen observers and frequently control the actions of both parents , but particularly the mother , by observing that Mrs. So-and-So permits her children to do this and that . Since the desire to keep up with the Joneses or , preferably , surpass them is part of the American mores , it is not difficult to see how such factors influence the portrayal of parental roles . This dominance of the mother inside and outside the home is a radical change from the motherhood of even a century ago . It is a far cry , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that wife sales were not uncommon in the United States . She specifically mentions an item in the Leavenworth , Kansas , Star of 1886 . A woman who ran away from her husband at Laurence some time ago was found at Fort Leavenworth yesterday by a Laurence detective and taken back to her home . The officer received an award of fifty dollars for her capture . 29 Changing Familial Roles in Contemporary Society 6g There is some conflict in the literature about how women have used this new freedom and exercised this new authority . Lundberg and Farnham list four types of mothers : the rejecting , the overprotective , the dominating , and the overaffectionate . They blame some of these types for juvenile delinquency and all of them for the alcoholics in society . 30 Strecker has also indicted the portrayal of certain mother roles in contemporary society and coined the term Moms for such persons . 31 Burgess and Locke , while recognizing these pathological types point out the changing structure of the entire American family , of which changes in parental roles constitute only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role deserves attention . It has been pointed out that the birth rate is decreasing . Mothers of today for various reasons are not so prolific as mothers of a century ago . At least one member of the psychoanalytic school believes that failure to have children in the modern world frustrates the creative instinct in women , and that women , as a result , have become neurotic on a wholesale scale . 33 It is possible to agree with these conclusions only within narrow limits . The uncertainty that women feel about their roles in life may lead to neuroses , but neuroses are scarcely limited to those women who remain childless , if all of the claims about dominating , rejecting , overprotective and overaffectionate mothers are to be credited . Rapid cultural and social changes resulting in a new sense of values appear to be more basic to the presence or absence of neuroses than the absence of motherhood . Effects of Changes ? Urban Living . Change has made a tremendous impact on the lives of all contemporary Americans . This is especially true of urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of rural people . Yet well-balanced personalities must be able to define their roles adequately so that they can come to terms with themselves . A little over a century ago America was what has been termed a sacred society . 34 The term sacred here is not used in a religious sense , but rather implies a stable , traditionally organized // society . Evidence presented here shows that cultural roles were rather well defined along patriarchal lines . Furthermore , they had been so defined for centuries . With rapid cultural change came social change . America , or at least urban America , shifted from a sacred to a secular society . The secular society is one characterized by rapid alterations in the way of life and system of values . Under such circumstances a redefinition of cultural role is necessary . Institutions which formerly reinforced the sacred society , such as religion , government , and education , either lost their power to do so or underwent great changes themselves . In a sense the family was left to shift for itself in a society which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mothers , husbands , wives , and children grope for a definition of their place and the place of the family in contemporary life . Each new fad or fancy sends them on a wild-goose chase which they hope will lead to the answer . Psychology and psychoanalysis have both made efforts to point out directions . Some of their contributions have been helpful , but what direction an individual takes is largely contingent upon which psychologist or analyst he reads and heeds . Their directions are , to say the least , at times contradictory . There are certain basic principles which can act as beacons whether an individual lives in the horse-and-buggy or atomic age . Certain modifications may become necessary in the application of such principles in a changing worla , but the principles themselves remain true . Whether authority is exercised by the father , mother , or both is contingent upon circumstances . In overthrowing the patriarchy the family has become highly individualistic and tends to reject all authority . In other words , the baby has been thrown out with the bath water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded the father from the family , except for biological or economic ends . Yet the conjugal type of family is precarious enough with two members . For Catholic families , particularly , there are answers to the problem of defining cultural roles . Some are to be found in // the very nature of man as a rational animal endowed with an immortal soul and destined for eternal happiness . In fact , the basic answer stems from this . The teachings of the Church , especially recent encyclicals of the Holy Fathers dealing with such matters as conjugal roles and parenthood , are helpful . The problem for Catholic families lies not so much in the correct answers as in the application of these answers in their daily lives . American Catholics live to a very great extent in a secular culture in the sense of an areligious culture . To retain their way of life in such a milieu is indeed difficult . They do have , however , a fundamental decision to make . Shall they insulate themselves from this culture ? If they do , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings their brothers ' keepers . If they choose instead to live within such a culture , and to some extent this is necessary , can they avoid succumbing to it ? Marshall Foch is reputed to have said that the best defense is an attack . Catholics and all religiously motivated persons have an obligation to attack the abuses and deficiencies of contemporary society , not merely by word but by deed . Theirs is particularly the task of affording a leadership that proves the possibility of adapting an urban-industrial culture to a religious way of life . In this task social science can be helpful . As Roman law and Greek philosophy were adapted to serve Christianity , so too can social science become an instrument for a more wholesome way of life . Catholics must join forces with all men of good will , and this includes most contemporary social scientists , in an effort to utilize not repudiate social science . This should especially be the function of all Catholics who happen also to be sociologists . Courtship and Marriage American society . If privacy can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , the automobile is usually available , to whisk couples miles from their homes , friends and neighbors . If no car is available , then the movies offer a fine substitute as a popular song of the twenties testified , " Take Your Sweetie to the Movies , If You Ca n't Make Love at Home . " Furthermore , small apartments with their paper-thin walls make the softest whispers of love in the living rooms clearly audible in the kitchen . Under such conditions courtship to a very great extent moved out of the home and away from family supervision . These are not the only reasons for the changes in courtship and the advent of dating . More leisure time , an increased freedom for women , many commercialized forms of recreation other than the moving pictures and cars , and urbanism have all contributed to this change . The above are intended only as signs of changed cultural patterns in the area of premarital behavior . ROMANTIC LOVE Another change of at least equal importance is the emphasis on the romantic love complex . Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lover . The extent to which it enters into the selection of a mate is uncertain , although many writers in this field consider it important . At best , however , it is probably only one of several factors that influence the selection of a husband or wife ( see Chapter 6 ) . Furthermore , its incidence and importance are likely to vary somewhat in terms of different groups within the culture . Young persons appear to be more influenced by it than older persons , women are perhaps more prone to it than men . These limitations should be kept in mind by the student in the discussion of romantic love . 1 The highly idealized conception of the beloved , resulting from the romantic love complex , causes the lover to view the beloved as the epitome of all that is beautiful and desirable , not as a fellow human being with a certain number of faults // and defects . This overidealization seems to prove that in such cases love is really blind . This love object , it is believed , is t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one and only , the soulmate with whom perfect happiness is certain . Under such circumstances marriage is a " must , " regardless of social , religious , economic , or almost any other kind of difference . If certain obstacles stand in the way of this union , all the better , for the challenge makes the romantic love complex stronger , and the individual will " climb the highest mountain , swim the deepest sea " to attain the beloved . Scholars are not in complete agreement about the origins of romantic love . Probably such a type of infatuation always existed in societies , but the complex seems to have been crystallized as a result of the troubadours , chivalry and court behavior in France in the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries . At any rate it has become fairly common in American life where it has been strengthened by moving pictures , novels , stage plays , and radio serials . Since moving pictures as an educational device have far-reaching effects in contemporary society , almost every boy and girl , and man and woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love on the screen . Even the techniques of love-making have been copied , crudely or skillfully , from the movies . As a result romantic love has become to some extent the only basis for marriage . Romantic Love and Marriage . In most societies the bases for marriage have not been love at all , but economic , family , or other more mundane considerations . Love was expected to develop after marriage , and apparently did . It is possible for true love to develop after marriage even when the basis of marriage has been romantic love , but it is probably more difficult . Romantic love is unreal and arouses false expectations which frequently can not withstand the assaults of reality encountered in married life . The premises on which romantic love are based are largely absurd . These will now be considered in some detail . 8o Courtship and Marriage First there is the element of overidealization in romantic love . Part of this results from the anonymity of modern urban life . In small towns or rural areas it is difficult to dissemble . Individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be known . In large urban areas this is not so , and the person is likely to be judged by his physical appearance , dress , speech and those facts about himself that he cares to divulge . Meetings between young persons are less likely to result from family friends . A University of Washington study revealed that only one in twenty of the persons in the study met dates through family friends . Most meet them through friends of their own age . 2 In urban dating young men and women are likely to see the partner only under the most favorable of circumstances , on the occasion of a dance , a party or some type of commercialized entertainment . At such times each is apt to be putting his or her best foot forward . Each is seen against a background quite different from that of married life . The background against which an individual is seen certainly enters into the appraisal . If a boy or girl is appraised against a June moon , summer breezes , soft lights , and sweet music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , the judgment is apt to be less reliable , than one provided by intimate , daily contacts in all sorts of situations . In other words , young persons frequently see only one facet of their partner 's character , that called out in the most pleasant environments . The second component of romantic love , that there is a " one and only destined by fate , " is somewhat ridiculous . Assuming that such were the case the statistical probability of finding such a partner would be rather low in urban life . Even if he or she were found , how could the opposite party be sure ? The answer is usually a sly smile and a knowing shake of the head . Somehow or other you will know when Mister or Miss Right comes along . Empirical evidence from divorce statistics seems to throw some doubts on this certainty , and the experiences of Rudolph Valentino , that unsurpassed of screen lovers , tend to emphasize the uncertainty . If // such a great lover as Valentino , with his wealth of experience , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , hope for the ordinary male becomes extremely dim . 3 Adjustment to married life is a matter of compatability . The more two individuals have in common , the more likely they are to get along together . Crossing of racial , ethnic , religious , or class lines only adds another hazard to marriage . Such impediments , however , appear to strengthen the romantic love complex as a result of frustration . Apparently some persons caught in the romantic love complex become negatively suggestible . If society in the form of law , parents , priests , ministers , and others attempts to dissuade such persons from a contemplated marriage , their determination generally increases . This inverse reaction can be explained partly by the irrational nature of romantic love . Thus , preventive medicine is the only hope , for the disease when contracted , appears to be fatal . Love Is a Learned Reaction . Actually love is a learned reaction . True love is a complex affair with physiological and psychological aspects , at least in the case of love between man and woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of others rather than of oneself . It increases through common interests and is rooted in respect for the partner as a person in the full sense of the word . True love is spiritual even though it has physical manifestations . Such a complex is scarcely innate in man and must therefore be learned . The learning process occurs first in the socialization of the child . Reared in a family where such love is in evidence , he can learn it by example . Religion is one of the best methods of inculcating true love because it provides knowledge of the divine Example of love and trains young people to discipline themselves for the love of God . True love certainly involves sacrifices , and unless the individual has been accustomed to making sacrifices in the interest of love in early life , he is unlikely to acquire the pattern suddenly upon marriage . The rise of romantic love in America is partly due to the development of individualism . Parents are not supposed to // adequate meeting places rob adolescents of the rationalization that they visit taverns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Types of Dates . There are various types of dates dependent on time and circumstances . They range from the so-called " coke " dates , which involves little more than meeting for a Coca-Cola , talking , and escorting the girl home , to a date for a formal dance . A boy is free to date a partner once and date her no more or to date the same girl occasionally but not too frequently , lest they be said to be " going steady . " There is a special variety of date known as the " blind date . " In this case two parties hitherto unknown to each other meet by arrangement , usually on a double date with another couple , one member of which is known to the blind daters . To some , blind dates appear adventurous ; to others they are distasteful and are entered into only to please friends . There is also the " pickup date " where one of the partners , usually the man , acquaints himself with a strange girl without any formal introduction . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , are hazardous . They exist because some young people find it difficult to obtain dates in any other way . The outcome of such dates may be a pleasant evening , a boring or humiliating experience , or even tragedy . Desirable Qualities . Most evidence on dating is furnished by studies on college campuses . This is unfortunate because most young persons do not attend college , and empirical evidence on their dating practices is not available . A study of 314 students on the campus of the University of Washington showed that students from homes in which parents were happy dated more frequently than those from homes where parents were unhappy . Students who were popular and made friends in high school continued to do so in college , leading to the conclusion that dating is a matter of personality . Most men had their first date at sixteen , most girls at fourteen , the difference probably being due to the earlier maturation of girls . According to this study , factors making for the " ideal date " from the masculine point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coloring , pleasant disposiCourtship // tion and good health . Women listed the following favorable characteristics : height , clean cut features , neatness , good looks , good coloring , and build . 5 Such lists of highly subjective characteristics actually tell very little about qualities desired in a date . They do indicate , however , that physical appearance is of considerable importance . That height is one of the important factors from the female point of view is attested by the request of a small women 's college in the East to a neighboring men 's college for a number of blind dates . Only one specification was made ? each man must be at least six feet tall . The actual qualities desired in a date probably vary with the situation . Men may take what they can get by way of dates in the ordinary routine . In the case of a special event , such as the Senior Ball or Junior Prom , however , the hometown girl may be especially imported for the affair if the college is some distance from the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not supposed to include emotional involvement , how can this be explained ? Dating is not merely a matter of companionship with the opposite sex but also of prestige . On most college campuses at least , there is a rating scale for dates . Burgess and Locke have collected considerable evidence on this . A number of factors enter into the choice of date . There is the matter of being a Greek or a " Barbarian " on those campuses where fraternities and sororities exist . At the University of Washington some fraternity men indicated that they did n't care whether the girl was a sorority member or not . Others found it more convenient to date Greeks and complained that nonsorority girls were difficult to meet . 6 In other places fraternity men date certain sororities and blacklist other sororities . Some fraternities demand that the brothers date only Greeks . 7 At some schools star athletes or leading members of student organizations may be sought as desirable dates . Apparently some prestige comes from dating the Big Man or Big Woman on the campus . 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates . Girls may date men because they can provide 86 Courtship and Marrzage expensive entertainment or gifts . Upper-class men may date lower-class girls for purposes of exploiting them in various ways . A skewed sex ratio facilitates exploitation in dating . If women outnumber men on a campus , as they sometimes did during World War II , competition for dates may be intense , and men can take advantage of the situation . If the male sex ratio is much higher than that of women , the opposite is true . Petting . Some of this exploitation may be sexual . In fact the whole question of petting on dates is one of grave concern to many young men and women . The term petting is not very well defined , but if it is compared with another term , necking , the latter is generally restricted to holding hands or kissing . Petting may have a much less desirable connotation , and at times appears to mean little less than actual sex relations . Premarital sex relations and undue intimacies are violations of the Catholic moral code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms as necking or petting . Sex ethics appear to have deteriorated , but there is no adequate evidence to prove this statement . It is unfair to judge the sex ethics of all young persons by the actions of the most radical youth in the country . Studies at Cornell and Michigan State College show that over 6o per cent of the men and women did not approve of premarital sex relations . 9 However , the fact that some 3o per cent did approve of such illicit relations is significant . Pope Pius XI has deemed it necessary to speak very plainly on this matter : There is danger that those who before marriage sought in all things what is theirs , who indulged even their impure desires , will be in the married state what they were before , that they will reap that which they have sown ; indeed , within the home there will be sadness , lamentation , mutual contempt , strifes , estrangements , weariness of common life , and , worst of all , such parties will find themselves alone with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in different words , practically echo the Pope 's statement . They say that such re-lations // . . . must of necessity be chiefly on the physical level , characterized by selfishness rather than mutuality . If it is between a couple who later marry each other , there is a strong possibility that their ability to achieve psychic union as well as physical after marriage will be limited by the fact that their relationship has been fixed at a physical level before marriage . 11 One of the chief rationalizations employed by men and women in this respect is the claim by girls that boys expect them to pet , and the counter claim by boys that girls expect them to pet . Landis and Landis questioned college students on this matter and found that only 9 per cent of the boys and 4 per cent of the girls agreed that a girl must pet on a date in order to be popular . When girls were asked to check the statement , " Girls expect a young man to pet on dates , " only 6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally wrong outside of marriage , the unmarried are obliged to avoid it . Avoidance is best accomplished by selecting dating partners with discretion and planning activities in such a way that occasions for petting need not arise . One of the dangers on a date is long periods of time with nothing to do ? sitting in a parked car in isolated spots , or leaving a dance or party temporarily to be alone with a date . The presence of another couple that is opposed to petting may help . For the girl or boy with few resources in the way of interesting conversation , ability to dance , or mingle socially with others , petting may be the way out . Cultivation of social graces may therefore help young people to avoid occasions of sin . The Non-Daters . One problem arising naturally from the rather general practice of dating is that of those who do not date . Since dating also involves rating , it may be that such young people lack the physical or social characteristics which make them desirable dating partners . In such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For girls this appears to be relatively simple , since make-up is used to some extent by almost all women . Charm schools abound in this country , and even many daily newspapers carry columns advising // women how they can attain beauty , grace , and the social attractiveness that characterize nationally known models . It is probably not necessary to go to this extreme to become socially acceptable . Most mothers should be able to help their daughters choose clothing and styles that would improve their appearance . Both sexes can learn to be sociable and to get along with those of the opposite sex if opportunities and training are offered . The more important reason for non-dating appears to be shyness and lack of opportunity . Shyness probably results from feelings of inferiority which are not uncommon in some young people . Boys and girls seem to have exaggerated ideas of what constitutes physical and social attractiveness based on motion pictures and advertisements . If motion pictures were the criterion , every boy would have to combine the handsomeness , athletic prowess , terpsichorean skills , and conversational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls would have to be Lana Turner and Ginger Rogers wrapped up in one person . As absurd as such notions may appear , some boys and girls seem to suffer from them . These young people may get some comfort from the fact that while they do not combine such characteristics , neither do their dating partners . Good health , neatness , cleanliness , courtesy , and kindness can be acquired by most young men and women and probably count much more in making them attractive dates for persons of the opposite sex than exotic characteristics which might appear ridiculous off the motion-picture screen . The real danger of exaggerated shyness , regardless of cause , is to render a number of young persons in society unhappy and ultimately maladjusted . A number of young men and women never marry nor enter celibate religious life . Some of them may find compensations in other occupations and activities , but many of them could undoubtedly have been much happier and better adjusted in the married state . Adolescence in American society offers sufficient problems to young persons without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really educating for life , they must make social adjustment one of their concerns . Parents , of course , should be even more aware of shyness in their children . Some parents make children shy by unkind comparisons among children of the same family or between their children and others or by constantly ridiculing attempts of young people to achieve adult status . GOING STEADY Despite the fact that the influence of romantic love is reputedly widespread , anonymity common in urban living , and individualism strong , there is a tendency for like to meet like and eventually to marry . Some of the more realistic considerations enter into the choice of a partner when the stage of " keeping company " is reached . Boys and girls of the middle class tend to associate with each other : Catholics with Catholics , Jews with Jews , and so on . While those who are fanatically democratic may decry such a tendency , it undoubtedly has certain values in the choice of a mate . In courtship these practices are to be encouraged , for they are usually indices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It simply is not true that all young persons succumb entirely to the romantic love complex . The organization of society itself makes persons of the same race , religion , ethnic group , and social class more accessible to each other . At the same time romantic love operates even within such groups , and similarity of race , religion , and social class alone do not predict complete compatibility . Parents also exert some influence directly or indirectly in the choice of a mate , although such influence has certainly declined . Absolute romantic love as a criterion for marriage is probably rare , but partial romantic love plays its part . As young men and women mature , there is a tendency for random dating to give way to " going steady . " Couples begin to pair off and associate with each other almost exclusively . This pattern is recognized and accepted by their friends . In go Courtship and Marriage fact , group expectations may play a significant part in this pairing process . The girl and boy tend to become the exclusive property of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is posted and generally respected . This procedure is the normal , almost inevitable , pattern preceding engagement . It should not occur , however , until both parties are in a position to consider marriage seriously . In the teens it has certain dangers , for such couples may not have had an opportunity to meet enough members of the opposite sex . Economic or other considerations may make the postponement of marriage necessary ; yet emotional involvement develops , sexual temptations may be increased , and the young persons find themselves in difficult straits . On the one hand they desire to marry ; on the other hand marriage may be impossible if the young man is to complete his education . Frustration is almost inevitable , and at times elopement or secret marriage may result . Even if marriage is entered into in a socially acceptable way , both parties may be too young , at least in the cultural sense , to accept the responsibilities of married life . Early pairing off therefore is generally to be discouraged . Intent to Marry . " Going steady " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party with an opportunity to know the other in all sorts of circumstances . Homes should be visited , parents and other relatives met , attitudes on homemaking and other aspects of life should be discussed . The young man should be quite frank with the girl about his position , and reception of the sacraments together will assist the couple spiritually . The next step in courtship is either a mutual understanding that marriage will take place or a public announcement of engagement . This period should include an even more intensive exploration of each other , and each should determine rather definitely the attitudes of the other on all aspects of married life . It is a period of trial when the young man and woman see each other frequently . Parents , relatives , and friends now regard them as potential husband and wife , and // each is received as a member of the other 's family and may gain insights hitherto denied . The real function of the engagement period is to determine compatibility . Financial matters should be discussed with the utmost frankness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The location and type of residence should be considered , whether the wife is to work or remain at home should , if possible , be determined , and in general as much as possible , future points of probable tension should be resolved . Delay in such decisions or fear of discussing such points because of possible disagreement is foolhardy . If discussion indicates that a couple is far apart in such ideas , and no accommodation to the other 's opinions can be arrived at , serious consideration should be given to breaking the engagement . A broken engagement usually means emotional upsets for both parties , but this is a much lower price to pay than years of maladjustment in an unhappy marriage . Marriage Counseling . At this stage marriage counseling can prove of great assistance . Many young couples have very little idea of what marriage really is and what adjustments must be made in this life . Sex education in contemporary society is generally inadequate , and what there is of it is more apt to be physiological than psychological and to omit motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eve of marriage , but it happens that some people arrive at this period of life either in complete ignorance of the significance of sex or , worse , with very distorted notions . PreCana Conferences offered by some parishes not only provide such instruction , but have the added benefit of presenting marital information and motivation to groups of young people . Thus , everyone present can profit from questions which perhaps did not occur to them , but were asked by others . Such conferences usually offer talks by priests , physicians , psychiatrists , sociologists , and psychologists , and this type of instruction is generally beneficial . Some parishes prat vide a course of instruction for engaged couples prior to marriage . Motivation is not sacrificed for a lecture in physiology , // and the spiritual aspects of marriage are not omitted in favor of the material . Whether parishes or other organizations provide such instruction or not , parents should certainly offer all that they can from their common experiences in the interest of helping the couple . Unfortunately many couples in contemporary society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridal gowns , honeymoon plans , and other less important details that they overlook almost entirely the significant questions to be raised and answered just prior to marriage . Engaged couples should certainly have recourse to prayer and the counsel of the church , and Catholic young people should share the sacraments to invoke the aid of God in knowing His Will , and Grace to assist their marital adjustment . THE WEDDING Marriage is a sacrament . As such it is a religious act in which Grace is attached to an external sign , the assent of the partners in this case , to enable the couple to adhere to vows made in this ceremony . It is also a public act in which church and state acknowledge the rights and privileges of the couple to live as husband and wife . Traditionally it is a day of happiness for the spouses in which relatives and friends join to wish them well and rejoice in their union . The Roman Catholic Church has surrounded this sacrament with a pomp and ceremony befitting it . The sacrament is administered , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be at a special Mass , the Nuptial Mass , in which the Sacrifice of Calvary is repeated for the intention of the couple . If such is the case , husband and wife receive the Holy Eucharist in the sanctuary . Instructions before the marriage ceremony are both beautiful and moving . 13 ince marriage is a sacrament , it can not be administered by a minister or justice of the peace . In the eyes of the Catholic Church such a ceremony , in the case of Catholics , is no marriage at all , a fact that every non-Catholic marrying a Catholic // should be aware of . Furthermore , for a Catholic to go through such a ceremony ' means excommunication , scarcely a propitious beginning for any Catholic in marriage . Despite the grandeur and sacredness of the Catholic wedding ceremony , some Catholic couples appear to disregard the Church 's stand in favor of secular or pagan customs which surround marriage in modern society . Since the Church treats marriage as such an important and holy institution , it is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make their intentions known to their parishes well in advance of the date . Some large city parishes are overwhelmed with weddings during certain seasons and can not arrange ceremonies at the time and date requested if the couple waits until the last minute . The Church likewise requires the publication of banns , usually on the three Sundays preceding the wedding . Baptismal certificates are also required , and in some cases can not be obtained from distant cities immediately . All states require marriage licenses , and some of them also require a waiting period , another reason why couples should plan well in advance the date of their weddings . In contemporary society , even among Catholic couples , the wedding day and the days immediately preceding are likely to be a period of nervous strain ending in physical and psychic exhaustion . For the groom , marriage is not infrequently preceded by a bachelor party to celebrate , ironically enough , his last night of freedom . The bride is likely to spend most of the night or early morning before the wedding on details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons face a public ceremony , tiresome photography , and perhaps an elaborate social affair . Certain wags are almost sure to exercise their wit and humor by a series of pranks on the married couple ? attaching shoes , cans or other noisy objects to the bridal car , blowing the car 's horn continually through city streets , or later hiding suitcases or clothing from the bride or groom . While such reputed wit appears to have traditional approval and may add to the fun of the guests , // it may prove nerve-racking to the tired bride and groom . Since it is their day , their wishes should be respected in such matters . At any rate most of these activities seem out of keeping with the sacramental character of marriage . There is unfortunately a financial aspect to weddings that both brides and grooms must consider . It is traditional for the bride 's family to pay the cost of her clothing , church and home decorations , and the wedding breakfast or reception . The groom is expected to defray the costs of the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bride 's mother and his own mother . If both parties are wealthy , there is no problem , but in most cases financial considerations determine the size of the wedding . It is extremely foolish for persons in moderate circumstances to plan large , expensive weddings , especially if the groom is thereby placed in financial difficulties at the very beginning of marriage . During the engagement period the couple should carefully determine the expenses of the wedding and plan it in keeping with their resources and the resources of the bride 's family . THE HONEYMOON The honeymoon is a modern convention to facilitate the transition from courtship to married life . A few hours after the wedding ceremony it is customary for the newlyweds to start on a trip by plane , train , bus , ship , or private car to a new environment , where they are unknown , where they hope they will not be identified as honeymooners , and where they can enact their new roles of husband and wife without interference from family or friends . It provides an opportunity for privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A satisfactory honeymoon can make the transition into married life easier , but it appears that a satisfactory honeymoon is not easily achieved . Some light has been thrown on honeymoon adjustment by Stanley R. Bray 's study . Unfortunately most of the fifty women queried had been married // from two to twenty-seven years and came from the South . They had been married an average of twelve and a half years , so for most the honeymoon was seen in retrospect . In addition regional differences probably made a difference . Nevertheless , only 74 per cent of the women considered the honeymoon a complete success , 14 and 56 per cent of them listed difficulties that arose on the honeymoon , such as brevity of the honeymoon , poor selection of places , financial matters , relatives , and clash of temperament . Lack of adequate sex instruction was an important problem . 15 Departure and Place of Honeymoon . One of the first problems in a honeymoon is the departure . Newlyweds want anything but publicity . In fact , traveling to a new environment is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the couple 's friends almost invariably appear at the railroad station or pier to throw confetti , shout good wishes , or engage in some behavior that attracts the attention of other travelers and identifies the couple as honeymooners . So , whether the trip is long or short , a number of persons on the train or ship share the knowledge which the honeymooners prefer to conceal . Even if newlyweds escape this , their own self-consciousness often identifies them . The place to stay should be selected with careful attention to the tastes of the couple and the cost and distance from relatives or friends who might intrude on their privacy . Long train or car trips , however , should generally be avoided . Such trips are normally tiresome enough and are very likely to make the already-tired bride and groom irritable . The honeymoon should be neither too long nor too short ? but long enough for the couple to make a reasonable adjustment in their new roles . Other interests should be planned for , since , despite their avowed exclusion of outside interests during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other if no diversions at all are provided . There may be a temptation during this period to make exaggerated promises for the future . Probably it is impossible for this to be avoided entirely , but each partner should try // to make allowances for the fact that promises made on a honeymoon may be more - indicative of hope than of fulfillment . Furthermore , the honeymoon , or any other time for that matter , is not the time for a confession of misdeeds , former loves , or indiscretions . A general confession is sometimes made on the eve of marriage in the sacrament of penance , and with this all reference to that aspect of the past should be closed . The past should remain buried as the past . Completely satisfactory sex adjustment is not common on honeymoons and should not be expected . If the couple has received adequate sex instruction and has acquired a truly Catholic viewpoint of marital relations , many difficulties can be avoided in this sphere . Chapter 6 Factors in Mate Selection There comes a period in the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make a decision regarding a state of life or vocation . The word vocation refers to occupation or position in life . In a way it is unfortunate that in Catholic circles this term tends to be restricted to the religious life or priesthood . There are actually three possible vocations or ways of life for men and women : the religious life or priesthood , the single state , and the married state . The single and married states are likewise vocations , in the sense that they are ways of life to which God calls very many people . One of the unfortunate results of restricting the term vocation to the religious life is that many young men and women fail to apply to themselves the splendid advice offered regarding vocations . Most Catholics realize that the decision to enter the priesthood or religious life is one to be taken only after prayer and consultation with a confessor . This is equally true of the married state . Young people are generally advised to consider the religious state most carefully before entering it and are in fact exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to reach a prudent decision . At least as much careful consideration should be given to entrance upon the married state , and while the nature of marriage rules out anything like a trial marriage , young persons should use the engagement period to reach prudent decisions on marriage and the choice of a life partner . Since the priesthood and the religious state represent the highest states of life , some young persons erroneously conclude that marriage is a much lower state and 98 // much less important . This is a fatal error . The most important state of life for any person , subjectively speaking , is the one to which God has called him , the one in which he must work out his eternal salvation . For the married , marriage is the most important state of life . WHY PEOPLE MARRY To a young man or woman deep in the throes of romantic love , it is relatively simple to answer this question : Why do people marry ? Some persons would undoubtedly offer a look of pained surprise and , if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people marry because they fall in love . Love is the only permissible basis for marriage , and nearly all claim that they married for love . Of course , marriage for love is highly desirable but the term love in contemporary society , like the shibboleth happiness , apparently means different things to different persons . Some who claim that they married for love appear to have married for love of money , for position , or for any number of reasons . Marriage motives like most human motives are complex rather than simple . Fundamentally people marry because such an institution exists in society and the system of values accords prestige to t his institution . If marriage did not exist , no one could marry . The culture , however , possesses such an institution ( People are reared in a climate of opinion generally favorable toward marriage . Church and state both lend approval to marriage , the former by making it a sacrament , the latter by providing certain legal safeguards to spouses and their property . Legitimate sex expression and the procreation and rearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , marriage is the approved way of satisfying certaun physiological and psychological needs tor the couple and society .
