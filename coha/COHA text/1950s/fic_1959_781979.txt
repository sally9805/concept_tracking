 | shaking . The song still sang itself . In the room we had watched Papa build for us , with Tauba sitting at the piano , with her fingers still moving , each finger , each joint of each finger . I saw her , saw her smile as she turned her head to look up into my face . And it was no longer for them that my heart burned with bitterness and horror . It was for myself . What was I doing here , living , living among them ? And over the horror came a wretchedness , a grief , a limitless grief , and I wept and wept . I heard Frau Eberhardt on the stairs . " What happened , Katarina ? What is wrong ? " I got myself under control . I opened the door . I saw her standing there , a middle-aged woman with real concern , with kindness on her face . She was not angry ; she was worried over what had happened to the girl , to Katarina . And it was all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to laugh hysterically over the world , the insane world . I said I had been seized with a sudden , dreadful cramp ; I had been afraid I would be sick in the restaurant . She sent me to a doctor . He gave me black pills . I told Frau Eberhardt I felt better . But a new dread was growing in me . Something so innocent as this song , coming back from my real life , could betray me when every false paper passed inspection . My feelings could betray me . I must have no feelings . I tried to concentrate on my work , to tire myself . I scrubbed , I did the heavy washing , I learned to be a perfect maid . For the first time I learned to cook . In their house , they were not badly off for provisions , except for certain items . Bread was strictly rationed . Butter was scarce . But in the cellar they had stored up hams , sausages , potatoes . Though it was forbidden for city folk to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | country to come to the Eberhardts . They had ducks , geese , and wild fowl brought to the back door by a " friend , " a keeper on a large estate . He would arrive a few times a week with eggs , cheese , and meat . They would invite him to spend an evening and would treat him with the most solemn respect , as though he were at least a cabinet minister . Once , after such a reception , there came a barrel of apples . I had to lay out the fruit on specially built tiers in the cellar , each apple separated with exactitude , so as to avoid spoilage . I was hesitant about touching any of their food supply , except for what I was told to prepare , and even though they had good things to eat , I found myself often hungry . There was an abundance of tomatoes  --  at every meal they had tomato soup , tomato salad , tomato juice , tomato sauce . And I had always had a peculiar aversion toward tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eberhardt asked me one day . " You do n't like our menu ? " I confessed . " Ah , you have been pampered , " she said . And yet I saw that I had gained another point in her esteem ; I was not merely a brutish peasant girl but a person with likes and dislikes , a person of taste . Nevertheless , I was hungry . At home we had eaten a great deal of bread . Here , the bread ration was carefully shared out each morning by Frau Eberhardt . She would divide each portion into three , for the day 's meals . Sometimes I would devour two of my bread portions at breakfast . " You 'll be hungry , Katarina , " she would warn me . During the day the gnawing hunger came . On a shelf in the pantry I discovered a jar of cookies . I stole one . It was delicious , a kind of butterfly-shaped delicacy , but solid and crunchy . I could not resist and reached for another .  | The jar was high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 look into it . I could not see the level go down . Each day I helped myself . And a few days later Frau Eberhardt took down the jar , remarking that she was going to send these cookies she had baked to her son in Berlin . Then a gasp broke out of her . " But they are half gone ! The jar was full ! " She stared at me . I admitted my theft . I had been there only a short time ; perhaps she would now send me back to the Arbeitsamt with a bad record . I would never get such a place again ! How could I have been so greedily foolish ! " Katarina , I did n't think you were that kind of a girl  --  to take things . " " I was hungry , " I pleaded . " I was hungry for bread . " And then , " I never realized I had taken so many . I just reached my hands into the jar , and they tasted so good , I . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German woman . " Like a child , " she said . " A child with a hand in the cooky jar . " She shook her head . " But you are a grown-up woman , Katarina . Twenty-two years old . " ' We were looking directly into each other 's eyes . I almost wanted to plead that I was only eighteen . Then she said sternly that she would talk to Herr Eberhardt about the incident . The next morning , to my astonishment , I found an extra bread ration on my plate . Frau Eberhardt explained that she had got it from her mother , who hardly ever consumed her bread . Herr Eberhardt gave me a long , quiet look . I wanted to say something , to pledge that such a thing would never happen again , but I could only thank them for the extra food . And even so , something like it did happen again , though I was n't caught . I had a terrible longing , now , for fruit . I kept seeing the apples in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , I stole down to the cellar and took an apple , eating it on the spot . I hoped they had not methodically counted each piece of fruit .  | And suddenly , as I bit into it , there came to me the memory of Papa and his apple tree . All through my childhood in the old house , the shtube , as the dwelling with its one large room was called , I could remember Papa longing for his apple tree . " On Sabbath , " he would say , " a Jew should be able to take his ease in his garden , to walk around , to pluck an apple from his own tree , and eat it . " We had no garden , no apple tree . We lived on the street that led to the market place ; it was the street of traders and grain dealers . As the peasants drove into Hrebenko with their wagonloads of grain , the dealers would run after them in the street , shouting their offers . And when the peasants had sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for provisions . Sometimes he would take bucketfuls of eggs in trade , and he would in turn sell the eggs to Yankel Chazanovitch , the egg dealer across the courtyard , a long-bearded Jew who had a strange rule of his own ? he would never step outside the boundaries of his yard . He would not run in the street after a peasant . Let the peasants come to him . On Sabbath the street was quiet , and then Papa would put on his long coat and go off to the synagogue . Once , on a weekday , I took his Sabbath coat and his fur-rimmed hat , his shtrimmel , and I donned them and went swaggering along the street with my flock of little girl chums laughing and cavorting around me . I got a good slap for it . Poor Papa , I gave him no peace ! On Sabbath I could n't keep still around the house . Papa would lie down for his afternoon nap , and then he would jump up roaring . " How is it in every other Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father lies down for his nap , not a whisper is heard ! But in this house there are only hooligans ! " And then he would speak wistfully of his dream of Sabbath ease , of walking in his garden and plucking an apple from his own tree . Soon afterward , times changed for us . First there was a bad time . The peasants organized a co-operative , with a store . Their  | leaders forbade them to buy from the Jews , and slowly they stopped buying from Papa , and his business died out . He roved around town , he went to Lwow , desperately seeking a solution . " A Jew must find a way for himself , " he always said . " A Jew must give himself a bit of advice . " He found a way . He opened a soda stand , sharing a sausage-seller 's kiosk , opposite the courthouse . Lawyers and even judges stopped at his stand . Then Mama thought of enlarging the business with a stamp-selling permit , for every legal transaction had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went , when there were officials to be seen . She would put on her fine brown dress and wear her beautiful knitted blue shawl , and she would stand before them in her stately way , speaking her flawless Polish , and they would respect her even though she was a Jew . And so Mother obtained the stamp permit . And then , condiments were added . And bottles of vodka and cherry brandy . And soon the half store was too small for Papa , and he cast his eye on a vacant plot across the street , and there he conceived his plan to build a fine modern building , with three stores downstairs , one for himself and two to rent out , and three flats upstairs . And behind it all would be a garden . And even before he began to build , he would plant his plum trees and his apple trees . And he had done it . At least , before the war came , Papa had lived to realize his dream , to walk in his own garden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , and eat it at his ease . And as I thought of all this , standing there in the basement in Linz , a shiver went through my arms , a twinge . For since that day of the shock over Tauba 's song , I had not once thought of my family . I had shut them all out of me , in my fear . Was I , too , killing them , only that I might live ? Day by day as I grew accustomed to my work and became a " jewel " of a maid , I sensed a personal interest in me growing in the  | Eberhardts . They discussed me a good deal , speaking always of " unser Katarina . " Herr Eberhardt was to me , of course , an elderly man , and there was nothing in the least bit out of the way in his regard for me , and yet I could not help feeling it was a pleasure for him to have a young woman in the house . I did not want them to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I could not help feeling pleased and even a little proud of myself when I heard Frau Eberhardt boasting to her friends of the wonder that she had acquired , of the talents of " unser Katarina , " who was not at all like the other Russian farm girls but was cultivated and even sensitive . A girl who asked for books to read . It was not that the Eberhardts were in any way lenient about my duties . If a shirt was not perfectly ironed , Herr Eberhardt would sternly admonish me , " Katarina , do it again , and do it well , or I will send you off to the lager . You know , we have concentration camps where you will learn such things as discipline and order . You should see the lines of beds in these camps  --  not a hair out of place ! " Yet they kept showing their personal concern for me . Herr Eberhardt installed a radio in my room . Frau Eberhardt gave me some nice clothes . Why did n't I go out on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I should visit the centers for foreign workers , they advised . There , gay times were to be had ; dances were held . I said I did n't know anyone and did n't care to pick up with just anybody at all . At moments I would feel toward Frau Eberhardt a sudden sweep of warmth . Perhaps it was because she was teaching me every household task , the things a girl usually learns from her mother . " Ah , now , you see , Katarina , " she would say , " when you marry , you 'll be able to take care of your home . " And so the talk would turn to boys . " Surely a pretty young girl . . . " I ought to  | find friends . I ought to go out . Frau Eberhardt even sat me down at her own dressing table one day and helped me to arrange my hair in a different way . It was becoming . They seemed so worried about me that I decided I had to make a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Wednesday I dressed quite nicely and under Frau Eberhardt 's approving smiles left the house . I could n't think what to do . I took a tram , rode to the end of the line , got off , walked about a bit , and then took another tram back to Froshberg . Hardly an hour had passed . I took a long walk . Still , I was home early . " What ! So soon ! " my mistress exclaimed . And what had I done with my afternoon ? I said I had met some acquaintances from the Arbeitsamt , in the square , and we had gossiped a bit . Ah , but I must go out more and amuse myself . The next time I went to the cinema , alone . Several times I did that , until even the ticket taker knew me and said , " But what 's this ? Such a pretty girl , always alone ! " I began to see that I was perhaps in greater danger by attracting attention to myself in this way than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eberhardt had been suggesting that I meet the girl across the street , at the Webers ' ? they too had a Russian maid . And so one evening she took me there . The Webers welcomed me warmly and led me upstairs to introduce me to their Marinka . She was a nice enough girl , but utterly dull-witted ; we spent an hour looking through her album of photographs from home and chattering about our mistresses , and then I asked her to come and visit me . And so we exchanged a few visits . Once when I said good evening to the Webers as I was going upstairs , I noticed a young soldier in the parlor , an airman . It was their son home on leave . A few moments later he was upstairs on  | some pretext , asking Marinka where she had put certain of his things . He made a little conversation with me . But I paid no attention . The Webers ' son was a typical German youth , blond , with a pointed nose and thin lips . Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Nazis . I rarely felt hatred for people . My impulse is to like people , and even in the worst days at the police commandatura in Hrebenko , I had felt a personal hatred for only a few . With the Eberhardts , I experienced no inner dislike ; indeed , we were becoming more and more human toward each other . In general , for the older Germans , I felt no hatred . It was the young people who aroused bitterness in me , for their entire way of being was antipathetic to me . Among the older ones you felt that this whole Nazi machine had overcome them , that they had simply been too weak to resist what they were forced to do . But with the young ones you felt that they wanted it . They wanted to do everything that they were doing . Their arrogance , their way of talking , their very walk  --  it was all there . And because of this instantly upwelling bitterness , I tried to avoid the young flier . But another time , he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aha ! " Marinka nudged me as soon as I got to her room . " What did he say ? What did he want ? " I shrugged . " From us servant girls , they want only one thing , " she said , and she giggled . Then came the incident with the skates . The snows had come . Herr Eberhardt and his wife discussed my footwear , and one morning Herr Eberhardt himself took me to a shop and bought me a pair of elegant overshoes , with a zipper . I chattered of the snowfall at home , ' in my village of Werchrata , and of the sleighrides , and of the ice-skating on the river near by . But I must go skating here , Herr Eberhardt insisted . There was an excellent rink in Linz.  | I reminded him that I had no skates . The next day , he told me that he had remembered that the young man across the street had an extra pair and would surely lend them to me . After supper , I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased  --  to lend me the skates . " They 're in the cellar , " he said , and down we went . A garden bench had been stored there for the winter , and there was also a huge umbrella , standing open behind the bench . He made some inane remark about summer in wintertime and asked me to sit down and try on the skates . Then suddenly his arm was around me , locking me against him . Silently , we grappled . All at once we heard an angry voice . " With a servant girl ! " His father stood on the stairs . Young Weber leaped up , red-faced . I left without a word . I took the skates , too , and kept them . At the Eberhardts , I said nothing of the incident . I went to the rink . It was a new breath of life to me to feel the clean movement all around me . In the grace , in the ease of it , humanity seemed so utterly innocent once more . There were girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirling and dancing expertly together on the ice . For the first time since leaving Hrebenko I completely forgot myself . Someone glided alongside me and asked if he might skate with me . I had been watching him  --  the best skater on the rink . " But I 'm not really good enough , " I said . " I 'll teach you . " And off we went . For the rest of the afternoon , we skated together . I became freer and freer on the ice . People were watching us , even applauding . As soon as I reached home , Herr Eberhardt asked , " Katarina , with whom were you at the rink ? " " Why , I went alone . " " Oh , no , you were with a man . Do you know who he is ? He is the star skater of Linz ! " " I did n't know , " I said . " He just asked me. "  | He looked at me . " Katarina , " he said , " you look too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it myself , sometimes , on the street . " I was startled . " Why , no ? " I began . " Be careful . We do n't want things said about our Katarina . " But what did he want of me ? How , then , should Katarina be-have ? Upstairs , I stared at myself in the mirror . I stared at Katarina , the Eberhardts ' Katarina , and it came over me  --  this was now myself . And in that moment I once more felt a strange dread . Who was I ? I tried to summon my parents , my little brother , Tauba , but their images would not come . Suddenly the past was blank . And then my panic grew . I could not remember the details of our street . I could not remember names . I began to tell over the names of my girl friends . My twin , Alla Blumenfeld . But for a long moment her sister 's name did n't come ! Why , we had grown up together , been together every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ! Alla and . . . Freda ! Freda . But how could her name even momentarily have disappeared from my mind ? It was only a few months since I had left Hrebenko . What could be happening to me ? One by one I sought to recover my close ones , my friends . I tried to see my farewell party . Who had been there ? Alla , Freda , of course , then Rita Mayer , and Rachel Schwartz , who had helped me with my papers , and Milla , Milla with her ripe figure , and . . . and . . . But what was happening to me ? Was this the amnesia that I had heard about , when people forgot their past ? Could it come over one gradually ? And who was I , really ? Why , suppose I had been born a few  | versts from Hrebenko , born as a daughter to that Ukrainian family , Leszczyszyn  --  suppose I had truly been their Katya ? At home I had been a certain person , Eva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they knew Eva 's family . But if here I was Katarina , only Katarina ? And then there came to my mind the tales of people , sometimes escaped criminals , who went to a new place and completely changed their lives , married under new names , had families , yet perhaps twenty years later revealed their true identity . When tales like that were told , I had always wondered whether it was really remorse that made them reveal themselves . And now I knew that it need not be a remorseful conscience . It was instead something like what I felt , a terrible fear , a terrible need to be known as oneself . And that night a memory kept haunting me . It was of a time when I had gone ice-skating in Hrebenko . I had got hungry , and in my usual impetuous way , I had rushed clattering back from the frozen river , along the icy streets of our town , without stopping to take off my skates . I had burst into the store , heading straight for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had both been away on business somewhere , and Tauba had been minding the store . I could see her , pulling the chocolates out of my hands . For again and again Papa had complained about our helping ourselves to whatever we wanted from the shelves . And today , Tauba had cried , she was responsible ! In a sudden rage , I had kicked at her . Instantly I felt as though the pointed skate were ripping into my own flesh , and even now , at the memory , I writhed and gasped with the pain of it . Terrified , I had tried to stop the flow of blood . I had screamed for help , and when people had come and Tauba had been carried upstairs , I had  | knelt weeping at her bedside begging her to forgive me . It had taken weeks for the flesh , cut to the bone , to heal . And no one had ever said anything to me for what I had done  --  not Tauba , not my parents  --  and that had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gust of weeping each time I came into our room , though Tauba had told me not to cry any more , that she forgave me . Yet the scar remained on her leg , and it seemed to me now that I saw Tauba , I saw her going from the train in Belzec to her death , still bearing the scar I had given her . In those days , as I kept trying to summon those who were dear to me and feared I was losing them , there kept growing in me a dreadful need for some word , some news of what was happening there . Were they all dead , the Jews of Hrebenko , of Poland , of the whole Ukraine ? I scanned the German papers , I listened to all the broadcasts . It was strange that the German people were given no news whatever of what was being done to the Jews . This campaign against the Jews had seemed such an important part of the Germans ' war ; everything had been so fully prepared , organized , carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . One would have thought that there would be constant reports at home of the vast extermination effort , so that the German people would learn how one of their great war aims was being achieved . But there was not a word on the subject . There was plenty said about the Jews in general ; the same anti-Semitic speeches were still being repeated constantly , and the awful caricatures were in the papers all the time . But news of what was being done  --  nothing . Was it perhaps already finished ? Were there no Jews left in that world ?  | Nor did the Eberhardts or their friends talk of the Jews . I sometimes even yearned to hear them curse us , revile us . Nothing . Had the Jews ever existed ? Had Eva ever existed ? One morning as she was laying out my tasks for the day , Frau Eberhardt brought from the closet a military uniform and boots . An important celebration was taking place in Berlin , and her husband was to take part . She placed the uniform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SS uniform ! And he was an officer ! Yes , said Frau Eberhardt , her husband was a major in the SS reserve . He had been assigned to remain in civilian work because of his age , and because his task with the railroad was as important as front-line duty . For two days I pressed and shined . For this meeting , everything had to be super-perfect . The Fuehrer himself was to be present . But if they were Nazis  --  even SS  --  how was it they never talked of the Jews ? Did n't they believe in all that , after all ? And so Ober-Storm-Fuehrer Eberhardt went off to Berlin and returned , and the great meeting was the subject of conversation at several dinner parties . It had been a celebration of victories in the East . Perhaps the victory over the Jews was too small to be worth mentioning . Only , that was the winter before Moscow . I knew that the German troops seemed to have stopped their advance . Perhaps they were merely waiting for the cold months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from the living room , where he was seated with his wife by the radio . To my astonishment , I heard Russian in the broadcast . But because of the  | interference , it was impossible to make out more than a few words at a time . " Tell me , Katarina , " he said , " is this language Russian ? " " Yes , " I said . " What are they saying ? " I tried , but could n't make out the meaning . " I ca n't tell , " I said . " There is too much noise . " Then he said , " You know , Katarina , it is forbidden to listen to foreign stations . I hope that you do n't do it . " " No . I listen only to the regular broadcasts , " I said . " Good . " He turned back the dials . But why had they been trying to get news from a foreign station ? Perhaps , after all , something was a little bit wrong for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once , when I was sure they would both be out for the entire day , I turned the radio dials . Backward and forward , I sought a foreign broadcast . But I could get nothing clearly . It seemed as though in the very air itself I was barred from coming upon an echo of my people . At last I decided to write . Mother had said to wait a few months before taking such a risk . The months had passed . And so one day I hurried through my work , took pen and paper , and went upstairs . I wrote and wrote , page after page , my tears smearing the ink . Never mind , let them see my longing . Everything had to be said in roundabout language  --  my dear aunt , how I missed her ; though all was well with me , I wondered how things were with her , I wondered about her health , and had she perhaps gone away ? Then I described as much as I could of my life in Linz . I sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged things . They would pass it on to Mama . And I knew it  | would be weeks before there could be a reply  --  if they were still among the living . The weeks passed . Then one day as Frau Eberhardt sorted out the mail she cried , " Katarina ! You 've got a letter ! " Seeing how excited I became , she said , " Well , then , the breakfast dishes can wait . Run upstairs and read your letter . " It was in Mother 's own handwriting . They were still alive ! " We are happy you are well and have a good job , and we only hope you can keep it . " And then came something incredible . " We have also heard about our little dove . " The word for dove was tauba ! " A bird flew in and took our dove with him to his nest in the woods , where they are free and happy ! " A nest in the woods ? Free and happy ? Was Tauba alive ? A bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Belzec and helped her escape ? But that was utterly impossible ! Further in Mama 's letter I found another hint . " A stranger came to the house one day and left a letter in your sister 's handwriting . We do n't know where he came from or where he went . " Then that was how they had heard about " our little dove . " From Tauba herself ! By a letter in her own handwriting ! Tauba was alive ! Alive ! And still further  --  Mama had separated the hints  --  I read , " You remember your father 's friend Bistray ? We 've heard that his brother is free and happy . " My father 's friend Bistray ? But Bistray had been chief of the NKVD during the Russian occupation of Hrebenko . He had been a friend of our family 's , in a way . But I did n't recall his having a brother . What could this strange remark mean ? I tried to remember all that I knew about Bistray . I saw the day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been excited by the beginning of the war . There had been no fighting , on that summer 's day in 1939 . The Polish police had suddenly disappeared . Papa had sent me rushing all around town on  | my bicycle , to his brother Nachman for flour , to the Blumen felds for kerosene , to the candlemaker . And then the Russians had entered our town , and several cars and trucks had drawn up to the regional police station near our house . Papa had said it was the Russian NKVD that was taking over the station . Soon enough , some of the officers had come into Papa 's shop for vodka . Until then , he had sold liquor only in bottles . But now they told him he could open the bottles and serve drinks in the shop , and presently it was vodka and not soda water that we dispensed . They drank and drank , and some days , when it got late , they moved to the back room and continued drinking . The NKVD chief himself , Bistray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged , with gold teeth . Papa said Bistray was a Jew . Mama was n't sure . A Jew did n't drink like that . But Papa insisted . And then , I demanded of Papa , if they were n't sure , why did n't they ask Bistray himself ? " If a Jew does n't give a Jew a Sholem Aleichem , you do n't ask him if he is a Jew , " my father said . Later , Bistray 's family arrived in Hrebenko . Mama said the wife was not Jewish , and surely the little boy was not circumcised . " With them it does n't matter , " my father said . " With the Russians , a Jew is like everybody else , and he 's no longer a Jew . " Yet once I did ask Bistray the question . It was when the Russians had finished off all of Papa 's vodka , and he could n't get to Lwow to buy a new supply . One day I saw Bistray in his car about to drive to Lwow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me along , and I went to Papa 's dealer and got a whole sackful of bottles of vodka , and on the way back , as Bistray seemed cheerful and we even sang some Russian songs together , I tried out a Jewish song . He picked up only the tune but did n't sing the words . " Do n't you know the words ? " I asked . " I thought you were Jewish , too . " He laughed and said that he had been born a Jew , but what of it ? A smart girl like myself  --  I was n't religious , was I ? I  | did n't believe in all that superstition , did I ? A God with a long beard , talking to Moses ? And I said no , not that . And we did n't talk any more about the subject of being Jewish . Nov I recalled the day when the Russians were leaving , two years afterward . That morning , suddenly , the sky had become filled with German planes , and the real war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from the border , all the Russians had started to pack . Bistray 's family was standing beside a truck in the yard behind the police station , while boxes filled with papers , records , dossiers , were being loaded onto the vehicle . And Mama had run to Bistray , begging him , " Take us ! " He kept shaking his head . " Take only the children ! " she begged . He was silent . " I implore you , instead of the papers , take the children . Jewish children ! " And he said only , " Do n't fear . We 'll be back ! We 'll let those swine come in a way , we 'll lead them in , we may even let them cross our own borders  --  and then we 'll break their heads ! " He smacked his hands together . " We 'll break their heads ! " And so Bistray had left us . And now I read his name again in Mama 's strange letter . " You remember your father 's friend Bistray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . " " Free and happy " ? the same words she had used earlier in the letter , where she said " a bird flew in and took our dove with him to his nest in the woods , where they are free and happy .

There must have been a partisan attack on that place of death ! Even with bombings by air ? " flown in . " Could it be possible ? Here , not a word had been heard of it . I was so borne up , swept up by Mama 's letter , I felt I could do  | anything , go through anything now . I would certainly live ! After the war , I would find Tauba and we would be together !

She had a letter for me . Only Anya could have written to me there . I begged Nina to send the letter at once . And meanwhile , Nina said , why did I keep myself a stranger ? Why did n't I come to see them ? I felt the same warmth as in my first contact with her . Yes , there in Bindermichel I had friends . Why was I afraid to go there , to Nina and Clava ? And suddenly I felt rich . I had Anya , I had Nina and Clava , and my Tauba was alive ! I danced with the broom . When Frau Eberhardt came home she said , " You had a telephone call ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , Frau Eberhardt , how did you know ? " " Ah , " she said . It was not with malice ; only , I supposed , to let me understand that everything was always known .

I told her it was from my dearest friend , the girl with whom I had come to the Greater Reich . My friend was working in Steyermark , in the village of Steinkeller am Grumming , on a large estate , as a governess for the landowner 's children , and she wanted me to come for a visit .  | Excellent ! It would be an excellent change for me . I must go ! Even then there came to my mind my mother 's advice to keep only a distant contact with Anya . But there was such a longing in me , such a need for some contact with home . It was as though I would otherwise lose myself entirely . Even as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been told by my mother not to stay out after nine o'clock , and if nine o'clock came and there was still life and movement and excitement around the town square , I would calculate this pleasure against a good slap in the face when I came home late , and usually I would decide to take the risk . Yes , I was still the same Eva . Since the trip would consume four or five hours each way , Frau Eberhardt said she would give me an extra half day on Saturday , for otherwise I would spend my whole Sunday on the train , with no time for my visit . She herself supervised my preparations . I wore my good dress , the one that Mama had insisted on putting into my satchel . Ah , Frau Eberhardt was pleased with her Katarina . I looked quite refined , elegant ! And so I went off . Here sits the maid on the train  --  who can tell what she is ? A young lady , at ease , relaxed , leaning back watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter woods , and then a chain of lakes , one more beautiful than the other . Peaceful towns , where it was really accepted that people had a right to live and to enjoy their lives . I closed my eyes , lulled by the rhythm of the wheels . Now the train climbed up into the mountains . And so I came to the station of Leoben , and Anya was waiting there on the dimly lighted platform ; who would say she was anything but a girl of the local countryside ? We fell into each other 's arms . " Katinka ! " And then we were in the dark lane , walking together , our  | stories tumbling out , the words tumbling over one another . It was a long walk to Steinkeller , and we were quite alone together on the tree-lined road , and I told her the wonderful news about Tauba . " Tauba lives ! " And there in the silent nowhere , two creatures alone in the whole world , we hugged each other , because of the feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing engulfed me . I suddenly whispered , " Call me Eva . When ' + e are all alone like this , Esther , call me Eva . " " I know , " she said . " Sometimes I feel as though I 'm not sure ? ? . ho I really am , Eva . " And even though I was ready to hear it , the name sounded as though it came from afar ; it was already not my name . And then I confessed to her the dread that had been growing and growing in me , the dread that I was losing my family , my friends , my real life in Hrebenko , even within myself . I told her how , even though ti e had been away only three months , there were moments when I already found it difficult to recall what people in Hrebenko looked like . Even people in my own family ! " And you , Esther . Is it that way with you ? " She pressed my hand . Esther was a little older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to her , too . Perhaps it was something within our own minds that was working to protect us , to cover our memory , so that there would be less danger of our being caught . Sometimes , she said , when she was among the other workers , perhaps even in their church , at mass , the memory of her sisters , of her father and mother , would suddenly come to her , like their presence . And it would seem to her that if any of the people around her looked into her face , into her eyes , they would surely see what she saw , and know who she was . And so perhaps for this reason  --  her hand pressed mine tightly  --  the mind itself shut off those memories , by a will of its own . " But if we lose them , Esther , how will we bring them back ? " I must not keep on calling her Esther , she whispered . We might  | pass someone in the dark . Or perhaps later , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still quite dangerous for her in this place . There were scores of foreign workers on the estate ; farmhands were endlessly coming and going . She could not tuck herself away , as I was luckily able to do , for she had to sleep in the workers ' quarters and to eat in their dining hall . Of those who came from Russia she had no fear , but there were Poles and Ukrainians , too , and these could more quickly sense that she was not exactly the type of Ukrainian girl she claimed to be . But as yet , thank God , nothing had happened . As to the place itself , it was a paradise . All was peaceful . To be in the country this way among the growing things , close to the innocent beasts , the cattle , the beautiful horses  --  this alone made her situation bearable . And the children . They were quite young , not yet spoiled or haughty , two little girls of four and six , and she had only to mind them , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens and the fields . The six-year-old had lessons from a tutor , and then Anya was left alone with the younger child , whom she adored . But away from the main house , things were more difficult . From day to night , there was the constant pestering of the men around the place . The plucking at her , the curiosity . Why was n't she like the other girls ? Sometimes one or another would take to following her around , for days , even weeks at a time . She did n't know how long it could go on . She was thinking of applying to the Arbeitsamt for a transfer , but what if she fell into something even worse ? Here , at least , there was so much natural beauty around her . And so we came to Steinkeller . There were large central buildings , and then cottages perched on the mountainside , their scattered lights winking through the trees . As we crossed the grounds , away from the main residence , there came the warm , sweetish  | smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the farmhands slept . At least Anya had a room to herself . And there she had prepared a feast for me : such wonderful sausages , and real butter , and farm bread , and fresh milk . The milk , together with the meat , struck me as a little odd , for at home her family had been so strictly orthodox , and even though Anya was modern she had by habit kept from breaking the kosher rules . Now she laughed ruefully . " Do n't you know what kind of sausage it is ? Pork sausage . " And both of us were quiet , thinking of our parents . In half whispers , we talked of what was haunting us . " What is happening there ? " she asked . " Have you heard anything at all ? " I told her how I had even risked dialing a foreign broadcast . Nothing . Nothing . " It 's as if they were gone off the earth , " she said . " Sometimes I have a terrible impulse to go back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see ? " " I know , " I said . " I too . " Then an odd and awful thought came to us . The silence , the void , the emptiness , made it seem as if we would be the only two Jews left in the entire world . And how , if it was ever all over , would we even make people believe that we were Jews ? " We 'll have to speak Yiddish , to prove it , " she said . I recalled how Papa would complain to me , " What , a Jewish daughter , and she ca n't even speak her mother tongue ! That I , in my house , should have such a daughter ! " But then in the last months , when I had been the errand girl for the commandatura and had run ten times a day to the Judenrat with messages and orders and requests  --  Meister Klein wanted a new gold watch , Herr Meyert demanded new boots , the commandatura demanded six fur coats  --  in those days the poorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for news , speaking in Yiddish , and my Yiddish had grown fluent .  | And so now with Anya , whispering in Yiddish , I talked of home . All night we tried to remind each other of things at home , of how life had been lived in Hrebenko . Nonsensical memories . The time the new cinema had been built for the Polish police school established in our town , and the cinema had been opened to the public three times a week , so we had two movies in Hrebenko . The time a whole band of us had gone to see the first picture in color  --  oh , it had been so beautiful , a picture based on an English classic , Becky Sharp . That night Lawyer Segal 's younger daughter Feigheh had invited us for ice cream , after the movie . Oh , what a horrible girl , a Becky Sharp herself . Lawyer Segal gave her more pocket money than any other girl in town , so she could invite everybody to the ice-cream parlor ; otherwise no one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught with a boy , in the lockers ? And that night in the ice-cream parlor , there had been twenty-two of us ! I had been there with my whole band of girls , and there had been that bold band of boys , Henig Weiss and the other boys who made eyes at us , and Esther ? Anya  --  had been there with the slightly older group , with my sister Tauba 's group .. . And so we talked , and then we went to bed , and all night long I lay trying to remember our town , to recall the life we had had " before . " Our Hrebenko was a pleasant town at the bottom of Poland , alongside a river where the horses went down to drink , and where we had our bathing places  --  the men upstream and the women below . I would go and watch the boys , and once I scooped up a boy 's clothes  --  another boy dared me  --  and we jumped on a horse , and the naked boy chased us all through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  | There was still another bathing place , farther up the river , hidden among trees and bushes . That was where the Hasidim went ; they were , of course , the most pious Jews of our town , and there even a " bandit " like myself did n't dare approach . I always wanted to see if their earlocks floated on the water when they swam . All around Hrebenko were the fields tilled by Ukrainian peasants . They hated the Poles , and they hated Jews even worse , of course , but that had always been so , and the ghastlier part of it , with the pogroms , was a tale told by Papa about when he was a boy . We children went out on hikes among the farms , stopping in the peasant cottages to fill ourselves with sour milk and black bread . Sometimes the family went by bus , past several villages , to the hamlet where Grandfather Yeruham Korngold had his store . Four sons had grown up in my grandmother 's shtube , and the store was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and their families . The eldest had wandered away to Paris , and the second brother , Uncle Reuven , lived there in the hamlet , and the third brother , Nachman , had become a flour merchant in Hrebenko , and my father had followed Nachman , to start his own first store . Hrebenko was not very big , but it had the regional court , and lately there had been built a brand-new institution , the training center for the Polish police and their watchdogs . We used to peek through cracks in the fence into the yard where the dogs could be seen learning tricks . Hrebenko was large enough to have a " better " section , where Jews were n't wanted , and a thieves ' quarter too  --  what town has n't ? Ours was known as " the sands , " and of course our high school had to be right there . My big brother Nahum went there , but for anything more in education , like becoming a lawyer or a doctor , he would have to go to Lwow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl , was determined to become one of the " intelligentsia "  | and somehow to get into the higher schools and become a lawyer and practice in the district court and be a part of the finer element , even to have a grand house like Lawyer Segal 's . Somewhere in it there would be a husband , too . But meanwhile I had to worry about studying hard enough to get into the high school , for only a very few places were open to the Jews . And ours was largely a Jewish town . Many of the young people , unable to get into the professions , had learned the furworking trade , and all over the streets you could see the scraped skins , set out on stretching boards . But our family was still among the " better off " because father , after all  --  even when he had only the soda stand  --  was a merchant . Menahem was his name . He was a tall man , very tall for a Jew , straight , solid , with lively blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own grandfather had lived to the age of ninety , with every tooth in his head . Papa wore a pointed little beard , and there were reddish tints in it , though the rest of his hair was darker . Each year Papa would clip his beard stylishly smaller , until we used to joke that he would soon be no Jew at all . But it was only when the Germans came , and their soldiers on the very first day caught Jews in the street and tore their beards off their bleeding faces , that Papa went into the bathroom and shaved it away . But I saw him , that night when I lay in Anya 's room remembering , as he was in my childhood , a cheerful man who loved to tell comical stories about the slow-witted peasants , and about their cunning , and his own cunning ; he had a quick temper too , even with his customers , and he would sometimes shout and exchange curses with them , but it would always end with backslapping over a bargain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with their trade . He liked to sing a snatch of song after meals and to flirt a bit with the ladies . Papa would tease Mama , describing the attractions of this one or that one who had given him the eye on the way to  | the synagogue on a Sabbath . Oh , what a fine piece of womanliness was there ! " I 'll put her eyes out for her ! " Mother would reply as required , but she had no fears . She was herself tall , imposing , quite a lady , although she had grown stout . Papa still loved to tell of the sensation she had made at the time of their marriage , just after the first World War ; he had still been in the barracks , a soldier , and when she had appeared there to meet him , with her regal beauty , the whole camp had been stunned . He was her second husband ; her first husband had been killed in the war , and she had been left with a baby son , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mother had a strain of melancholy . But she would not yield to it . She was always busy , active , the center of all the women of her circle , the advice-giver about everything from a change of business to a marriage . She was always busy in the house and she was always busy with Father in the store , seeming to be in both places at once . And nothing was left undone . Mama was a plain old-fashioned berya , a perfect housewife . Her tzolent was the richest in Hrebenko , her lokshen ( noodles ) were the thinnest and finest . Even though " aristocrats " like Feigheh Segal bought their dresses in the Bon Ton shop ? styles said to come straight from Vienna  --  Mama would already have dressed her daughters in the same mode , copied from the samples in the windows . It is on her knees that I see her , pinning a hem on a new frock for me , circling me on her knees , in the kitchen . And it was at these times that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womanly things . " Alai Blumenfeld and all the other girls said I was lucky because they did n't even dare open such a subject with their mothers , and they marveled because my mother was so advanced that a girl need not be ashamed to speak to her . And so , during these fittings , pinning a seam , her hands acknowledging how I was filling out and becoming " already womanly , " Mother would speak to  | me of how it would be for me . With a Jewish girl , it could n't be like with our little shiksehs from the farms . With us , a girl , a woman , had to hold herself to her real value . She would cheat not only her future husband but herself of the greatest treasure of her life if she became too free before marriage . Unquestioningly I knew that so it would be : as a good Jewish daughter I would bring myself to my husband , who would be the man I loved , chosen out of love . And of course there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep down , in the dark recesses of the soul , there was the fear and yet the fearsome curiosity over what could happen , otherwise . There were always the whispered legends of Jewish girls who had been " led off their paths " by gentiles . But how could it happen ? In our town , in our school , Jews and non-Jews hardly even spoke to each other . And so , having touched upon womanly things , mother would rise from her knees , she would brush her hand over my dress , smoothing the cloth over my new curves , and she would say , " Take it off and run outside . Put on your old dress and go run in the fields . Sing , yell , you are still only a child ! " For all through childhood I had had such wild energy in me that sometimes I would run in the fields and shriek out loud , out of sheer exuberance . Each summer Mama moved to the town of Ulanov , where she took the baths for her rheumatism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  their little girl Rita was my own age  --  but I made such a commotion , climbing trees , peering into people 's windows , shrieking and yelling and laughing , that Mama had to rent a cottage just outside of town , and there she could let me run in the fields , shrieking my head off , and tumbling and fighting with my little brother Yaacov . But as soon as I got into high school , being accepted only because my big brother Nahum had become a legend as the school 's most brilliant student , I tried to subdue myself . I even wondered whether there was something wrong with me , for being so filled  | with energy . I made solemn attempts to become ladylike ; I would practice walking with short steps like our mincing Milla Stein , and I would try to hold down my voice and speak softly like my sister Tauba . When Poland was invaded in 1939 , I was thrown into such a frenzy of excitement , of activity , that I remember my mother trying to quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what war is . " And she told me about the first war when her husband had been killed , and how alone she had been , with Nahum a baby , and how there had been scarcely a family untouched by death and disaster . Yet , as the Russians came into Hrebenko , the first words were " It will be good . " By this was meant , of course , good for the Jews . There were new edicts by the dozen . All were free and equal , even Jews . No longer would we have to compete mortally with one another for the few places assigned us in the schools . I was almost sorry that my big brother Nahum had gone off to Palestine , for now he could have entered law school . All the Communists of the town were jubilant . There was dancing in the streets , and the noise of the loud-speakers never stopped . The Russians rigged off parts of the square every night , for dancing . The young people came out ; everything came alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownclad soldiers were on good behavior . They were from far-off Tashkent , and even our refinements of Hrebenko were a marvel to them . From Papa , they bought every trinket , every flashlight , every toy . And everywhere , they were continually pulling the chains of the water closets ! When we made jokes of this , the answer was always the same : " Ah , you may have toilets , but we have tanks . " The NKVD moved into the fine new regional police headquarters that the Poles had built , only a few doors from Papa 's store . They had scarcely settled when we saw one of their cars drive up with Dr. Miller , one of the leading Zionists of our town .  | He went into the station with two Russians , and we did n't see him coming out . Soon we saw others going in : our town notary with his pincenez , some of the leading lawyers . I watched anxiously for Feigheh Segal 's father . No . At least , not yet . But others  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ulanov and told how her parents had disappeared . And one day I saw Mother sewing some bags out of stout cloth . They were a certain size , like small sacks , and I knew what they were . Each bag could hold twenty pounds of clothing and necessities . That was what the NKVD allowed people to take along . If they came to your house for you , they gave you fifteen minutes to get ready , and so it was best to have the sacks on hand . Yet in spite of the disappearances , the town remained cheerful . Things happened only to the old ones . The world was for the young . In the schools there was a rush of activity , new teachers came , new subjects were taught , capitalism belonged to the dark ages , religion was a superstition , and we had a special new choirmaster , Starshusky , who came straight from the Soviet Union , and we sang , we sang our heads off . Jews and gentiles sang together . We even talked to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Lucia Rosenska , and she came to the house every day to do her homework with me and to practice singing , for our choral society was going to become the biggest and the best in the region . There was going to be a competition  --  the Russians were always holding competitions , socialist competitions for everything one could imagine  --  and the best choral society in our region would be sent to Odessa for the grand finals ! One day I came home from school and walked first into the shop , as always . A strange man was behind the counter . Mama was serving vodka at one of the tables . As I passed , I said to her , " Where 's Papa ? " She whispered , " He 's in back in the house ;  | they 're making him a night watchman at the grain bins . Go speak to him , Eva . " I hurried back there and saw him sitting in the gloomy kitchen in the half basement . And his bitterness poured out . Oh , he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a capitalist ; he was the owner of three flats and three stores that he had managed to build with his life 's blood , scraping , borrowing , paying fantastic interest rates . He was a blood-sucking capitalist , and though he and his wife labored from morning till night to give an education to their children , to give them a decent life , he was to be flung aside on the refuse heap . And all that he had labored for  --  what good was it ? A daughter running around with a gentile , everyone laughing at him . I could n't speak . For it was true . It had started at school , but not with a fellow pupil . Not for Eva ! For Eva it had to be different from anyone else , And so it was with a teacher . My teacher of literature , Andrey Putko . Why had I had to give that last pain to Papa , and Mama too ? I did n't want to think of it . It was one thing I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , reflecting bitterly how , if any one good thing could be said to have come with the arrival of the Nazis in Hrebenko , it was that their coming put an end to my being seen with Andrey Putko . For most painful of all was to remember what he had done , later on . In the morning , Anya brought our breakfast up to the room . Everyone around the estate knew , of course , that she had a visitor , but she did n't want to expose me needlessly . She brought a tray heaped with good things  --  real cream , hot bread , fresh eggs . Then , she said , we had to go to church . " All the Polish farmhands go , " Anya said , " especially the girls . Do n't you have to go , in Linz ? "  | I explained that the Eberhardts were not churchgoers , and so I had told them that I too was not really observant , and they saw nothing wrong in my not going . It was mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anya explained . I was afraid I would n't do things exactly as they should be done , but Anya assured me that she was by now an expert , and that I had only to murmur when she murmured , and all would be well . Though I had watched the maids pray at home , I had never been to a service . The little church was bright , as though everything , even the walls , were embroidered , and the atmosphere was different from what I had expected . It was not sanctimonious , but earnest and fresh . The girls from the farm were all freshly scrubbed ; their checks glowed . Some came with their young men , who walked stiffly in their Sunday clothes . Everything was orderly and quiet instead of tumultuous as in a synagogue , where people kept moving about , gossiping , each one praying in his own way . Here , it was like a small theater , with a beautiful show , with singing , and fine costumes , and bells . There was no danger that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , but I liked the way they did everything , and I liked the way the people were solemn here , in their religion ? if they could only be serious and pure like that all the time . But for them , too , it seemed to me , the time inside the church was like play-acting . They were more serious with one another than was natural , and more solemn with themselves , and when they came outside , except for a few girls who looked truly spiritual , their faces instantly changed , as though they were actors coming off the stage . Just outside , Anya introduced me to one or two of the girls , and we chattered for a moment , but I could see how distant she was from them . ' Was there really no one for her here ? Not one person ? I thought of the few weeks I had spent at Bindermichel , and how  | friendly Nina had been , and Clava , how instantly I had felt a rapport with them . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Webers ' . Poor Anya . We walked in the fields . " You do n't know , you do n't know what it 's done for me , to have you here , to feel myself close to a human being again , " she said . " I know . It 's the same for me . I know . " And I confided , " Sometimes there 's such a longing in me , I 'm afraid that I 'll do anything just to have a friend . Sometimes I have such a longing , just to be a young girl going out with a young man . I 'm afraid , if I should encounter one who is nice . . . " I had said it . I had brought out my most intimate fear . Anya looked directly into my eyes . Her own eyes were quiet . " At least here , for me , there 's no danger of that , " she said dryly . And I thought , She is older than I ; what nature is doing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need that is growing in me has been known to Anya , too . And I felt somehow reassured . We walked on , over the winter fields . Ours would have to be a long winter . Soon it was time for my train . Anya hurried to the kitchen and brought me a huge package to take home  --  cheese , eggs , and , most important , a solid lump of real farm butter . I gave it all to Frau Eberhardt , who was overjoyed . What a wonderful friend I had ! I must go there often . I must have my friend come and visit me . The trip had done me so much good . It had made a changed girl of me . And it had . For days , it was as though I were still with Anya , telling her things , asking her advice , babbling of home . I talked to her in my mind . But then the hunger for companionship became even worse than before . The excursion , the outpouring to Anya ,  | had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . My sense of isolation became unbearable . I thought more and more about Nina and Clava at Bindermichel . While I could not be as close with them as I was with Anya , could not really be myself , I could nevertheless feel that I was among friends . Though they were not Jews in hiding , they were foreign workers , like myself , in a strange land among an enemy people . I could even hear forbidden jokes about the Nazis . I could even laugh with them . And there would be the warmth of chattering with young women who were not clods like the maid across the street . And so I began to visit Bindermichel , even though I knew it was somewhat risky for me to expose myself in the transit camp . I would slip into Nina 's and Clava 's room , and sometimes Nina would be sewing on a new dress , and Clava would be primping while she gossiped about her adventures with her friend Hans , an Austrian who always risked arrest when he was seen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foreign workers . Nina had a man friend , too , named Karlus ; both Nina and Clava had already been married and had lost their husbands in the war . Always , between the two of them , there was man-talk , and in my innocence I would often ask some naive question that would provoke gales of laughter . Partly because of this , I felt , they loved to have their little Katya about , and they insisted that I come out with them to the movies , when they had dates to meet Karlus and Hans . I did n't want to be a fifth wheel , yet I went . And so in this atmosphere I began to feel myself more and more stimulated . There were always little remarks from the girls  --  did I like this man or that man ? Was I attracted to this or that movie star ? Among the Czech workers there were some fine young men , and Karlus would be glad to bring one along . What was my type ? I bantered , I hinted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even thought it might be best if I stopped seeing them altogether ,  | and yet when I saw them brighten as their men were coming , when I saw the little attentions that Karlus gave to Nina , and heard their little private jokes , I too longed to live that part of my life . Then , on one of my visits to Bindermichel , I saw a young man loitering at the entrance to the barracks ; he was handsome , neatly dressed , dark , with that look in his eyes of someone who has his own opinion of the world and can say sharp things . I was attracted . I could not help asking Nina who he was . " Ah , at last ! " She laughed . " She 's really a woman  --  our Katinka ! " The young man was a newcomer , she said , a Hungarian . She knew nothing more about him . All week I kept telling myself it would be foolish , foolish . To risk everything for a little flirtation . But on my next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bindermichel , and again I saw him in the yard . This time he struck up an acquaintance . Could he meet me in town on Sunday , perhaps take me to a movie ? I agreed . I was nineteen , warmhearted , and my young woman 's body could not be halted in its ripening . In my solitary room , where the solitude had been so welcome , so prized , I had begun to feel hungers , and to weave my girlish fantasies of someone who would be there with me , fantasies of being enveloped , held so close that everything passed from my body  --  all the tension , all the longing , all the fear . And yet in the few intervening days the apprehension grew . What could it lead to ? He was a goy . If anything happened , it would be again a betrayal of my mother , my father . Was it for this that they had sent me out to be preserved ? After the pain I had given them through my romance with Andrey Putko ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I saw him from my seat in the classroom  --  a small , tense man with an over-large head , not even handsome . His face was rather  | thick , and the features seemed always to twist themselves together before he could get out what he wanted to say . We girls had always made fun of him . And then the girls started saying , " Putko keeps looking at you , Eva . He looks at you . " That was how it was among us . Boys were very shy about approaching girls . But there would be a long period of " looking . " And even a grown man could look . " Looks at me ? He looks at everybody ! " I retorted . " He 's just trying to catch me out ! " For Andrey Putko loved to catch his pupils passing notes to one another , and I was a frequent offender . But several times my eye caught his . He was looking . How could such an unbelievable thing happen ? A teacher , a Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew all about Andrey Putko , as we knew the intimate lives of all our teachers . He had a girl in his home village , only a few versts away . A pretty girl , too . He had been going with her for years . But now I found myself looking at him . He was not so ugly . The way he twisted his face around showed a certain earnestness . And he was a sensitive man ; he loved poetry . And his voice , I now noticed , was quite warm and agreeable when he was not speaking officially as a teacher . One day toward the end of the winter term he called on me to recite a poem we were to have learned by heart . Although I had become a good student since the Russians had livened up the school , it just happened that I had neglected to do my homework for that day . So I admitted it . " Very well , " he said in his schoolteacher voice . " Then I 'll fail you . " " Fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know I am a good student ! Just because for one time and only once you catch me without my homework done ? " He stared me straight in the eye , and I felt a strange inner thrill .  | I knew he had had to dare himself to do it . " You 're failed , " he said . And I saw him mark it in his book . I sat down . Walking home , the girls could n't stop questioning me . What was I going to do about Putko ? It was surely a sign that he was in love with me , that he persecuted me , Milla Stein said . " That 's how men are . If they feel soft toward a girl , they act hard toward her . " We had seen that in many movies . That night I deliberately did n't study my literature lesson . The next day he called on me again . " I have n't learned my lesson , " I said , " as you 've already failed me . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his official voice , " I have decided to let you take the final examination after all . But you must make up these lessons . " Out of the corner of my eye , I saw Alla 's yellow braids vibrating as she shook with suppressed laughter . After school , as I was going out , the teacher fell in step beside me . " Are you going home ? " he asked . I had a little bundle of cloth under my arm . Mother was working so hard in the store that she was letting a seamstress make a dress for me . I told him I was going to the seamstress . " Do you mind if I walk with you ? " he asked . I was astounded . But perhaps he wanted to tell me something about my schoolwork . We began to walk . Right through the main square , to the other side of Hrebenko , we walked together . I was sure that every head turned . And he did n't talk about my lessons . He talked about movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh again and again with the sharp way he had noticed things about each one . He talked about the changes in the school , the new activities , just as though I were someone on his own level . When I went in to see the seamstress , he waited , and then he started walking me home . But when we passed his house  --  I knew  | where he roomed , in the block next to ours  --  I said he mus n't trouble ; I would go the rest of the way alone . And he understood ; I was unsure of the effect this would make on my parents . He said , " What are you doing tomorrow ? " Then he meant it . And I wondered , Why me ? I was lively , I knew . But I was not the class beauty . I had fine teeth , a wonderful skin . My mouth was too large . I knew more . I knew I had a full , warm bosom , and when by accident or half by accident a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , shame , desire , embarrassment  --  a whole muddle together  --  attacked me , and the best way out was to be boisterous and laugh . And so now it was starting , with a real grown man , not one of the gawky schoolboys . A teacher ! And a goy ! Several times more we took walks after class . Then came the examinations . In the finals , the teacher would remain in the room , ready to help , if there was something a student did n't understand in the way a question was put . He would come and sit down on the edge of the seat and explain . I saw Alla call him , and he sat with her . Then there was a question I honestly could n't understand . I raised my hand . He did n't come . He walked out of the room . After class , Andrey met me . Indignantly I demanded , " Why did n't you come to me ? You helped everyone else . " " Do n't you see ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone else , I could . But with you , they would make something of it . " " But why ? " " It 's just so . " And I knew perfectly well that certain things had to be answered by " It 's just so . " Something deep and womanly in me answered in the same way when I asked myself , " Why me ? Why does he choose me ? And why am I attracted to him ? " Something ,  | a warmth , flowed through me , as though to put such questions to sleep . We took our bicycles and rode to the end of town , to everyone 's favorite trysting place , a little grassy hillock overlooking the river . It was an artificial hillock , made of earth heaped over a storage pit where Alla 's father kept his stores of gasoline , for he owned Hrebenko 's gasoline station . I suppose every couple who went to sit there had to listen to the same joke : " Watch out ! If things get hot between you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we sat there looking at the river , I said suddenly , " Why me ? Why did you choose me ? " He laughed softly , and repeated , " It 's just so . " Then he sang a popular song . It always begins this way You do n't know why or how But suddenly you 're taken with a girl And after that it 's too bad . At first you see her just a little , And then you keep wanting to be with her more and more , And in the end though you wish it was n't so You feel you can no longer bear to be without her . I kept looking straight ahead , afraid to look at him . Straight ahead , so as to keep track of what was happening to me . A Jewish daughter out with a goy . I still tried to talk , of little things . I told him a comical story about the wives of the Russians . A number of them had come to stay in Hrebenko , and they had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few nice things were still to be had : sheer nightgowns embroidered with lace . The Russian women must never have seen anything like these things at home , for they had bought them and worn them to a ball  --  as evening gowns !  | We laughed . And then , as he put his arm around my waist , I flushed , confused , for I realized I had talked to him of nightgowns . And just then he kissed me on the mouth . It was my first real kiss . A kiss meant real love . I was upset , and at the same time impatient to run and tell the girls . We had promised one another , as soon as one of us really " felt something " with a man , she would tell the others . Had I " felt something " ? And as we kissed again , and I tried to know what I was feeling , everything came into a tumult within me . I could never marry Andrey ; he was a goy . Even in the new times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . So here I was , playing with love , and I was ashamed of that , too  --  one must not play with love . And what of his village sweetheart ? We never spoke of her . The next day I told Milla Stein , and Alla , and Rita . After the giggles and the laughter and the gasping were over  --  about his kissing me  --  the earnest , secret , feminine questions began . Had I really felt " it " ? Yes , I said , I had felt it . It was indescribable . And so Andrey and I kept on meeting . We would stay out until the hour when people came home from the movies , and I would say we had been to the movies . And one night , lost in kisses , we found we had outstayed the hour . I became frightened , and Andrey said that this time he would take me to the door and face my parents . Papa flung open the door as we approached . " Please , it 's my fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have kept your daughter out so late . " Papa quietly accepted the apology . And even when Andrey went off , Papa did not turn on me in anger . There was more of deep sorrow in his face as he went to bed , silent . But Mama had come out , and she spoke to me in a tone more intimate than ever before , touching to the very center of our lives . " Eva , I know . I remember very well the feelings of being a young girl . But what  | will happen ? Suppose you really fall in love with him ? Does he want to marry you ? Are you still a Jewish daughter ? Would you marry him ? " " No , Mama , that will never happen , " I promised . And we looked at each other as woman to woman . And I tried in those nights in the spring of 1941 to think , to find out in myself what I really believed , what I really felt . For now I was grown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of a man , a certain man , unexpectedly could tug at the very insides of a girl . Yes , now I knew what it meant to " feel something . " And now everything was changed around us , too . Things were more free ; we knew that all people were the same , even Jews and Ukrainians and Poles ; we knew in our schools that there was no God , Christian or Jewish , so what did it all matter ? And yet I knew in my heart that I could never do it , I could never do it to my family . It was one of those things that had to be answered by " just so . " I could not give up going with Andrey . I did not know how to stop . And then the answer came of itself when the Germans invaded Russia that summer . Andrey Putko went back to his village , and a few months later certain stories were heard about him . I did not want to think of those stories . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a dream , in the days before I fled from Hrebenko , and even in my little room in Linz the same dream would sometimes come to me . I would be sitting with Andrey on the hillock overlooking the river , with his arm around me and my head against his shoulder . And then I would be fleeing , fleeing from a troop of SS . And I would look behind me for an instant , and every one of them would have the face of Andrey Putko.  | For the story was that a number of Jews had paid peasants of his village to hide them , and my Andrey Putko had given the Jews away to the Gestapo . That was all I had known of love . And now I was again attracted to a man , " just so . " And again , a goy . But how could it be otherwise , in my present circumstances ? Was n't I too a gentile , so far as he was concerned ? And was n't he , if he was here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nazis ? On Sunday , I dressed quite smartly , wearing a fine woolen jacket that Frau Eberhardt had given me and that I had tailored to my own size . And I wore my high-heeled shoes . She sensed my excitement , for she complimented me on my appearance and said , " You are going to meet a young man , Katarina ? " Yes , I said , one of the foreign workers , and we would be going out together with my friends at Bindermichel . She smiled approvingly . His name was Lazlo , and we went to the Centralkino together with Nina and Karlus . He was well-bred , gallant , and his opinions about the film were in good taste . After the movie , strolling back to Bindermichel , each couple walked separately , and then he began to make little roundabout remarks , as though he were searching me out , while careful not to show too much of himself . When I asked what sort of job he wanted to get , he said he could n't tell yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was not a place for a girl like me , either . Why had I really come ? For adventure , I said , laughing . And I too talked in roundabout ways , and all the while I felt that there was something  --  that there could be something  --  if only we could reach each other truly . And this was the most awful of all the feelings , in our condition : that you could not show yourself , even when your heart went out to a person .  | It was the hour when the gates closed at Bindermichel , so he could not take me home . I went alone on the tram . And after that it was Lazlo whom I imagined , in my girlish fantasy , coming to me , being with me . Night after night I imagined him , I imagined that the door of my room would open , and he would come into my room . His face would lean over mine . And in our secrecy we would tell each other everything about ourselves . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would whisper it back to me . That would be his name of love for me . Eva . And then I imagined something even more strange . Perhaps he too was Jewish ! Perhaps that was why he was so roundabout , and troubled ? Could it be possible that a man could hide his identity through all the medical examinations ? But , after all , there were gentiles who were circumcised , for medical reasons , I had heard . And there were also Jews whose parents had detached themselves from their religion , or had even converted to Christianity and had not had their sons circumcised . Could it be some bond of that sort , unknown to us , that had nevertheless drawn us together ? And I imagined how we would one day reveal our secrets to each other . And after that we would feel so close , so intimate . His fingers would caress me . Perhaps his fingers would even touch my breast . And I touched myself . I was afraid and ashamed , I could not know that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was never to know his secret , if there was one . For the Hungarian disappeared . Nina knew only that his card was no longer in the files , not even in the job-assignment files , and he was no longer at Bindermichel . Things happened that way sometimes . Nothing . And yet the longing that he had awakened in me grew and grew , and with it my sleeplessness . My unrest , my yearning , my secret fear and shame at my nighttime desires  --  all this had to be hidden . It increased the part of my life that had to be submerged ,  | and I became more nervous . At about this time I began to feel the pains in my arms . And as a result of these pains there developed an episode that took my thoughts away from love and brought me back to my danger . At first , I felt only twinges at night . Sometimes during the day when I was lifting something heavy , a shooting pain would go through my arms , and I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains grew more prolonged . I would rise and sit for hours by my window , waiting for the twinges to subside . I was certain the trouble was rheumatic . All day my hands were in water , laundering , scrubbing . I had not wanted to complain of anything , in my job , for the Eberhardts ' house was so perfect a place of refuge , and I feared that if I could not do the work or became troublesome they would send me away . But Frau Eberhardt herself noticed that I was becoming pale , my face drawn . And one afternoon , right in front of her , as the needlelike sensation shot through my arms , I dropped a panful of water . " What is it , Katarina ? " I told her . It was particularly when I had to do the heavier work , the washing and scrubbing , that the pains came . That night the matter was laid before her husband . He questioned me about all my symptoms . Herr Eberhardt was most considerate . It was perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used to such work at home , to do the heavy washing . Let the linens be given out to the laundry . The next morning I gathered up all the soiled sheets and tablecloths , until there was a huge bundle . How would I get it to the laundry ? " Put it on our little wagon , " Frau Eberhardt said . Like every family , they had a small pullcart . But as she pointed to the cart on the back porch , something happened within me . In Hrebenko such carts had had a special use . On such little  | carts , the hog butchers had pulled their wares from house to house . No respectable person would be seen pulling a hog wagon ! " No , no , I ca n't do it ! " I cried out . Frau Eberhardt was astonished . Why , it was an ordinary little shopping cart ! On the streets of Linz , the best people could be seen pulling their little shopping wagons behind them . This was , of course , true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken hold of me . I burst into tears . I could n't . I could n't ! She called her husband . " Our Katarina is too refined to pull a shopping wagon in the street ! " she snapped . Herr Eberhardt drew himself erect . " Katarina ! You will take the laundry in the wagon ! " " I ca n't ! I ca n't ! " They stared at me . And even through my convulsive feeling , it came to me that I might somehow give everything away . I tried to control my sobbing but could not . Somehow this affected them . Their Katarina was indeed in some peculiar way a refined person . Frau Eberhardt , without anger , said , " I will go with you and you will pull it , Katarina . " We loaded on the laundry . I regained control of myself . With my mistress stalking at my side , I drew the wagon along the pavement . I became quieter . I tried to explain to her , even to joke about how one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home where I came from . Not long afterward there was another incident . It happened at Christmas time . For a week I was busy with preparations . The house was polished and festooned . The Eberhardts ' son , with his wife and baby , was coming from Berlin . But in addition to the family festivity there was to be a huge dinner party , a traditional Weinacht feast . I spent long hours in the kitchen preparing puddings , cooking , baking , piling up delicacies for the great day . The young couple  | arrived from Berlin , and in addition to all my other work , I had to wash the baby 's diapers . It happened that I had never before done such a thing , and the first time , I vomited . " Ah , Katarina ! Our Katarina is so delicate  --  you would not believe it  --  a girl from a farm ! Never mind , Katarina , it 's good training for you when you have one of your own . " The dinner hour arrived ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalted connections for the occasion ; everyone was at least an Excellency , and there was a retired general who came often to their house , a little apple-cheeked grandpapa . Indeed , the general had taken quite a fancy to me and would never sit down at the table unless " die Katarina " brought along a chair and sat beside him . The cider flowed , and there were innumerable hells and toasts to all the Nazi chieftains . And as the guests filed in for dinner , there was my general protesting that he would not sit down without his Katarina . So the chair had to be brought , and in between serving the courses I would sit beside him , and my presence provided a great subject for conversation . How serious a girl I was , a constant book reader , and what an excellent cook I had become ? I was a wonderful example of what could be done with a girl from those primitive lands . And one of the ladies kept teasing Frau Eberhardt : " Ah , where did you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Katarina , would you desert the Eberhardts and come to me ? " I was almost at the end of my nervous strength , from all the chatter about myself , all the questions . But at last the time came for departure . As the guests stood at the door , Herr Eberhardt reminded me , " Their coats . Help them with their coats . " And one of the men , when I helped him on with his overcoat and handed him his hat , pressed some money into my hand . A tip . Suddenly unnerved , I flung the money down , ran to the kitchen , and collapsed at the table , sobbing uncontrollably . The general  | was the first to rush in . " But , Katarina , nothing was meant . A little Christmas money ! Trinkgeld ! " He stroked my hair . Frau Eberhardt stood over me , worried . " Katarina , what has happened to you ? " And now Herr Eberhardt was in the doorway . I rose and said I was sorry . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exhausted . As I helped the rest of them on with their coats , I heard Frau Eberhardt explaining that it was all because Katarina had become more like a daughter than a house helper . Over and over she declared that they loved me and treated me like a daughter . And everyone wished me a Merry Christmas , and I wished them the same . And strangely , this idea that I was like a daughter seemed to have taken hold of them . Not that I had to work any the less hard ; I was like a good daughter who keeps very busy around the house . But the atmosphere became still more personal . And with Herr Eberhardt I increasingly sensed that curious , unspoken feeling of a woman who is aware that a man feels her presence . I had no understanding of it ; I had not ever considered that an elderly man could be disturbed , as a young man might , by a girl 's presence in the house . But I felt his awareness when I came near , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed him on the stairs , and there were times , too , when I found him " looking , " exactly the way the boys at school had done . Yet there was nothing ever in the slightest way irregular in his manner with me . One evening when his wife was out at a meeting he brought a bottle of liquor from the cabinet , and two glasses , and asked me to sit with him . The conversation was commonplace , and yet the sense of something between us could not be broken .  | Then suddenly the bell rang . " Do n't open , " he said , " Take the glasses to the kitchen . " He put the bottle away and went to the door . It was his wife . After a moment , she came into the kitchen . I had washed the glasses but had not put them away . " Ah , " she said , " you had a visitor ? " " No , " I said . " But there are two glasses . " " Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must have had a long talk about me . For it was then that their unusual idea was put forward . It was so strange a proposal that at first I could not quite realize that they meant it seriously . Late one afternoon , as we were in the kitchen together , Frau Eberhardt , while supervising the dinner preparations , broached the subject . " You know , Katarina , Herr Eberhardt and I have been discussing your future . We have become very fond of you . We would like to keep you with us always . What would you think if you were to become our daughter ? " I said I was really touched that they could even think of me in that way , but of course I understood it was only a manner of speaking . But no , she said , it was serious . A sensitive young girl like myself  --  I needed someone to be responsible for me . And perhaps when the troubles were over they could make it possible for me to continue my studies , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . She was serious . I felt tears coming , tears from some helpless sense of the world 's utter insanity . I thanked her again and I said I could n't do anything such as she had suggested because I still hoped my parents would one day return alive , from Siberia . Well , naturally , she said , if ever my parents returned and I wished to go home to them . . . But a girl like myself  --  my possibilities should n't be wasted . And did I realize the advantages that  | would come to me as their ward ? I would become a citizen . A German citizen ! And the main thing , my children would be German . Completely ! I must think about it , not only for myself but for my children . I must think about it seriously . I said I would . I thought about it , of course , more seriously than they could imagine . For in their good intentions lay the most terrible of dangers for me . In order to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated down to my grandparents on both sides . The village that Katarina Leszczyszyn came from  --  Werchratawas in German hands . The authorities had only to write to Werchrata for the Leszczyszyn family records . And then they would be informed that the said Katarina Leszczyszyn had died in 1939 ! I lay there , picturing the arrival of the information exposing my false identity . Would it come first to the Eberhardts ? Or would the Gestapo appear ? The bell would ring ; I would go to answer it . Or would it be in the middle of the night ? After I had answered the door , the Eberhardts would come down  --  and I could see the shuddering horror on their faces ! All these months that I had been in their house , they had been contaminated by me ! And their friends , and the general with the dried-apple cheeks  --  contaminated ! " Our Katarina ? Is it really possible ? " And then I had images of that mysterious place , Belzec . The train went through the gate . Would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of Papa and Mama , of my little brother Yaacov , of my sister Tauba ? No , Tauba had escaped ! And I could escape ! And in my sleeplessness I writhed , as though struggling against some crushing wall that moved slowly , inexorably , closer to annihilate me , as in some horror film seen in childhood . I clawed , as though to seize hold of the smooth metal surface , to seize the wall , to clutch the floor that now tilted to slide my body , all our  | bodies , into the deep black pit where my body would be dissolved in a bed of quicklime . My fingers clawed , tore at the metal , at the stone , and sharp electric pains pierced through the very nightmare . My nightly pains . And half awake I vowed I would escape . Then I saw a band of partisans , fierce , with their fierce eyes and dark mustaches . They leaped over the walls , and there was pandemonium in the deathly prison . With our bare hands we fought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran back and seized my little brother Yaacov by the hands . But no , why did I see him so small , a child of six , when Yaacov was already a big boy  --  thirteen  --  when I left home . Fourteen now , if he was alive . He would fight ! He would himself become a partisan . And later , we would arrive together in a boat , to the shore of Palestine , and we would see Nahum standing on the shore waving to us ! And then I drew myself out of that fantasy , foolish , doomed girl , and I pulled at my hurting arms as if to pull them off and end the pain . I got up from the bed , bathed my arms in cold water , and sat and stared at the wintry night sky . And a heavy , dreadful knowledge assailed me , something I had known and not wanted to know  --  by now they were all dead . Since receiving Mama 's letter about Tauba , I had written back , and written again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer had come . Yet to my first letter from Linz , Mama 's answer had been immediate . Even if my second letter had gone astray , what of the third ? And why had neither been returned ? I had argued to myself that the silence was perhaps only a sign that contact was dangerous . Once more I gave myself this answer . I must wait . I must hope . And so I went to lie down again . And then in the midst of this dread , the yearning came . Oh , for someone to hold me . All this was too much for me , alone . I was only a girl , a girl who should be held close , protected , and so now  | He would come , my unknown one , like some medieval knight climbing to my bower , and he would carry me away . And the pain stabbed and burned in my arms . For a week nothing had been said about the adoption idea , and I began to hope it was only a passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at dinner . " Well , Katarina , have you been thinking of our plan ? " Thinking ? If they could know what thoughts it had given me ! And Frau Eberhardt said , " Katarina , we do n't want to hurt your feelings . But who returns from Siberia ? The Russians are primitive , they are murderers , without the slightest human conscience . Do you know how many millions of their own people have perished in Siberia ? Even before the war ? People like your own parents , the well-to-do peasants who would not give up their farms to be collectivized . The Communists have sent three millions of them to Siberia , and not one has returned . I do not want to make you feel sad , Katarina , but we must face life as it is . " Then Herr Eberhardt said , " And if by some miracle they should return , Katarina , think what life would be for them . They would be elderly , broken people , and in a subjugated land . We must not delude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . As our ward , our daughter , you could then be of help to your parents . For you would have become a member of the German race . " " How is that ? " I asked . " I was born Ukrainian . " And would I not give that up , they asked , to become German ? But how could it be possible for a person to change what he was ? I asked . And now Herr Eberhardt explained to me that in special cases it was possible for someone to become a German . Before the adoption ,  | I would have to undergo an examination as to whether I was fit for acceptance into the German folk . Since I was from the Ukraine , and not from the distant reaches of Russia , filled with Tartars and Mongols , I was undoubtedly Aryan . Therefore the basic qualification existed . And so , if I would agree , he was ready to make arrangements for me to go through the formalities of this examination . There was no need to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time gained . Meanwhile , I must write to my native village for these records . I stood there , silent . Agreed , then ? Both were smiling at me . Would I write for the records that very day ? And Herr Eberhardt would meanwhile write to Vienna to make an appointment for the examination . Could I refuse ? Were they testing me ? In spite of the warm relationship that had grown between us , were they suspicious ? Was this simply a way to examine me further , without losing their precious maid ? That night was again sleepless , but I was able to think clearly . And I came to a series of decisions . First , there was no way to refuse what they asked . I had to agree to face the examination . But secondly , I must do everything possible to escape from this idea of adoption before the question of my records from Werchrata became an entanglement . That meant that within a month at most ? when the papers would be expected back from Werchrata  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their employment . But how ? I did not have the right simply to quit . Perhaps Nina could help me . Yet I knew that she could not send me to another employment unless the Eberhardts were dissatisfied with me . How could I make them dissatisfied ? The twinge in my arms gave me , for once , some comfort . Suppose , because of these pains , I could no longer satisfactorily do my work ? Suppose the pains became worse ? So my course was clear . For the first part , compliance . They  | expected me to write the letter home , for information about my family . I would give them a letter to mail , in the morning . And I wrote a letter . I wrote it directly to our Polish friends . I have had no news of my aunt for some time , I said . In her last letter , I learned that she was ailing , and I began to fear for the worst , since I knew her condition . Please do not try to spare my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she is gone , please write to me and tell me so . The tips of my fingers could not feel the pen , and yet they burned , they stabbed and burned unendurably . In the morning , Herr Eberhardt himself noticed that something was wrong with me . The coffeepot shook in my hand . " Katarina , you are not well ? " I showed him my hands . Even from the first hour of housework , my fingers were already wrinkled and pale from immersion in water . Herr Eberhardt touched my fingers , pressed the skin , and even then I could feel nothing . " It is poor blood circulation , " he said . I must go to see the doctor . I said no , no , I was too much trouble for them . Herr Eberhardt went to the stairway and called his wife . She cane down and studied my hands . She questioned me about my sleepless nights . And she too insisted that I must go to their doctor . Surely , her husband added , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Had I come to a decision about their proposal ? Had I written the letter to my village ? Yes , I said . To someone in the town near by , who could get the records for me . And I gave him the letter to mail . The doctor told me that my pains were undoubtedly rheumatic ; he recommended massages and gave me a salve . Also , I was to refrain from lifting anything heavy until my condition improved .  | That night the Eberhardts again held counsel over me . What could Katarina be allowed to do , and what must she not do ? The problem was attacked item by item by Herr Eberhardt , in much the same way , he said , as he would attack a problem in railroad administration . As each item was disposed of separately , the problem would be solved . Now , therefore .. . Bed-making . This was light work so long as the beds did not have to be moved . Katarina could make the beds every day . Laundry . The heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the light washing , being careful not to keep her hands too long in the water . Cooking . This was light work . House-cleaning . The floors . Scrubbing was done by means of brushes attached to the feet , and as there was no pain in the legs , but only in the arms , floor scrubbing could be continued . Also waxing . However , moving the furniture during floor-scrubbing and house-cleaning was heavy work . A thorough scrubbing and cleaning twice each week  --  or perhaps only once weekly for the duration of this emergency  --  would suffice . And for this weekly cleaning , someone else would have to be present to move the furniture . Herr Eberhardt looked at his wife . " You are quite strong , my dear . " " No , no ! " I protested . I could not have Frau Eberhardt do the hard work for me . I would have to call her each time there was something too heavy for my arms . I would be ashamed ! And it was not only the furniture-moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my arms were always in pain . No . And I heard myself suggesting , in a sad voice , that perhaps it would be better for them to ask the Arbeitsamt to supply them with another girl . " Katarina , what are you saying ? " cried Frau Eberhardt .  | " Unheard of ! Out of the question ! " said Herr Eberhardt . Did I take them for unfeeling people ? These pains had come upon me in their service , and it was their responsibility to see me through until I got well . Certainly in a few weeks , with massages and treatment , the pains would disappear . Meanwhile Frau Eberhardt would do the heavy work around the house . And she did , once . A few days later , opening the mail , Frau Eberhardt informed me , " Ah , Katarina ! The appointment has been made for you in Vienna ! " In Vienna ? For the examination , for the adoption . In Vienna , there was a special commission for the consideration of candidates who applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire day off for the trip . From this trip I felt certain I would never return . Yet , what could be seen on me ? Had I not passed a dozen physical examinations , the most complete , the most intimate , from Przemysl to Linz ? What new thing could they ask that might lead me to betray myself ? I took the train to Vienna . The office was in an imposing building on the Ring . I found the right door , lettered Commission for the Determination of Qualifications for Integration with the German People . Inside , a receptionist verified my appointment . I saw no one else waiting . It was apparently not a busy office ; this was an uncommon opportunity and privilege that the Eberhardts had obtained for me . The receptionist led me to a dressing room and told me to disrobe completely . Naked . Again , naked . I undressed and waited . What did they want of me now ?  | In a moment she returned and led me to the examination chamber . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a long council table , and twelve men turned their eyes on me as I entered . Near the head of the table sat a stenographer . I was merely a specimen , I told myself , and I would not even blush for them . I would look in my turn at each of them ; they would be my specimens . Yet I could not look into their eyes . I saw each of them , but with my eyes opaque , as though I were not looking . The head of the committee was a fat individual with the traditional thick , creased neck of the Germans . He was half bald , with light eyebrows , and looked like the comical German bandmaster in some childhood schoolbook rather than the tall , blond godlike youth of the Aryan posters . And his colleagues were an assortment such as one might see at a professional lecture ; a few of them looked quite professorial , with glasses and bookish complexions . And one was quite small and dark ; he might even have been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and another was rather young , with bad teeth , and then there was one who frightened me . He had dark pouches under his eyes , and heavy brows . He was quite thin , hollow-looking . And he kept looking at me steadily , unblinkingly , with pale eyes , looking not at my nakedness but at me , with a slight , cynical expression around his mouth , as though he knew everything , everything . The examination began with family particulars . I recited them as usual . The fat one at the head of the table , the chairman , or the director  --  whatever he was  --  asked the questions in a bland , patronizing voice . He had a folder before him , but it seemed necessary to have the same answers come from me again , in their presence . The stenographer wrote down the data . I felt almost angry at her , a woman , seeing me standing naked there and not even giving me a glance of sympathy .  | Werchrata . One of the professors repeated the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map that I had not noticed , hanging on the wall behind them . It was a huge map . But would such a village as Werchrata even be shown on a map ? " Near Lwc w , " I said . " And the nearest town is Hrebenko . " Even in uttering that name , I felt I might give myself away . " Ah , Lwow . Lemberg . " He repeated the German name for the city as he placed his finger on the map . And then he found Hrebenko . And then , to my astonishment , peering closer , he said he had found Werchrata . He seemed satisfied that it existed , and came and sat down . From an anthropological point of view , he remarked , it should be noted that there had been Germanic population in the Ukrainian region for several centuries . Admixtures were common . The white-haired one said to me , with a laugh , " You are sure you did not have a grandmother , perhaps , who indulged in a little admixture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt my nakedness . Only the cynical one had not changed his expression , nor had he taken his pale eyes from me . Their pallor , set in the dark circles of his eye pouches , was terribly disquieting . I said that as far as I knew my family had always been completely Ukrainian on both sides . Another of them made some remarks about the name Leszczyszyn , using the word etymology . I said it was a fairly common name in our area . Had our family originated in Leszczyn , then ? That I did n't know . Another asked whether the members of my family were darkhaired , as I was , or were some of them blond ? My mother was flaxen-haired , I said , and on her side of the family almost all were blond . My father was dark , and on his side  | of the family , it was about half and half . I gave the name of my mother 's family . They , too , were from Werchrata . One of the examiners now rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he began dictating particulars to the stenographer . " The specimen is a young female of good bearing , unblemished , twenty-two years of age ... " He asked me to open my mouth , and he looked at my teeth and described them . My two front teeth have a gap between them ; this was a mark , in my real family . He noticed the gap and recorded it . Then he produced a tape measure , and he began to measure me as a modiste would . Shoulders , bust , hips  --  he called out each measurement to the stenographer . Thighs , ankles , the length of my legs , the length of my arms . He asked me to hold my arms extended . And he proceeded to measure the length of each finger ! Then he studied my fingernails and described them . " Pigmentation , " he said , and he noted their coloring , and even the size of the moons . At the far end of the room was a scale . I stepped on the scale ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor said , " A specimen of the hair , please . " For an instant I failed to understand . But he pointed , and I took a few hairs from my head and pulled them out . " Thank you , Fraulein . " And he went to a table near the window on which there stood a microscope . He placed the hair under the microscope and sat there , studying my hair ! Meanwhile one of the others approached me , to take his turn . It was the little dark one who looked Jewish . He was , I suppose , an anthropologist , for he carried a large , shining pair of calipers . I had never even seen such a tool , except in the windows of instrument shops . Now I was asked to sit down , and he proceeded to measure my skull . He measured it lengthwise , and frontwise , and  | sidewise , and he called out the measurements to the stenographer . He measured the height of my cheekbones , the width and length of my jaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller instrument and measured my nose . When he had finished with me , it was the turn of the whitehaired one , who seemed to be a medical doctor . He asked me about the regularity of my period . Had I ever been pregnant ? He asked about childhood diseases . And then he too dictated particulars to the stenographer , describing my abdomen , my hips , my breasts , even my nipples , and adding that the specimen was well adapted to childbearing . And yet , it was not over . There was another medical doctor , a ponderous man with thick hands , thick lips . He was perhaps in his forties . As he approached , I had an instant feeling of revulsion ; it was something about his skin , perhaps even his odor . " Step into the cabinet , " he said , indicating a little booth with a curtain . The feeling of revulsion became even more intense as he followed me into the small booth . It was so narrow that I could hardly turn without pressing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into my arm , looking steadily at me , as though this were something personal between us . He drew a blood sample and handed it out to one of the other men . Then , with a small flashlight , he peered into my eyes , and I could feel his warm breath . He examined my ears , even my nostrils . He used a stethoscope against my chest . Finally he grunted that he was finished . The entire examination had lasted an hour . Now I was told I could go and dress . The cynical one 's pale eyes still followed me . He had asked no questions . He had never joined in the discussion . I went and put on my clothes . Whatever would happen would happen . To my surprise , they called me in again . The fat one at the head  | of the table addressed me . " Fraulein , " he said , " I have the honor to inform you that the examination has proven you to be extraordinarily qualified to become a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aryan race . " I thanked them all . Now that I was dressed , the cynical one was not even looking at me . Then , as I shut the door behind me , I was filled with a sudden great wish . That one day I might open it again . It would be a day when the war was ended , and when by some miracle it would be possible for a person to be what he was . I would open this door and I would walk into the room where the twelve scientists sat , the anthropologists and the etymologists and the historians and the physicians and the biologists , and that one with the circles under his eyes . And I would say , " Gentlemen , you pronounced me a perfect Aryan specimen , extraordinarily qualified to become a German . I must decline . I am Jewish , my parents on both sides were Jewish , my grandparents on both sides were Jewish , and so were their parents and their parents ' parents , down to the days of Moshe rabenu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that day would come . But on the train back to Linz my amusement evaporated , my spirits dropped . For surely the Germans would win ; they would conquer the world , and even if I remained alive there would not be a Jewish man alive to give me a Jewish child . And what was I dreaming of ? Here I had passed their examination ; I was marked qualified . So the adoption process would continue ! I would have to produce the Leszczyszyn family records or they themselves would send for them . How long could I delay ? A few weeks ? A month ? Unless I got free of the Eberhardts , I was doomed .  | That night I told the Eberhardts the joyful news of my acceptance as worthy of becoming a German . " A toast ! " cried Herr Eberhardt , and he brought the bottle out of the cabinet , with three glasses . " Ah , now you will truly be our Katarina ! " said Frau Eberhardt , I , and she embraced me . The glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " proposed Herr Eberhardt . And we drank . And the next morning , I could feel nothing with my fingers . I could not even manage the buttons on my dress , and when Frau Eberhardt arose , I had to ask her to help me . It was a strange sensation  --  almost as when my mother fitted my clothes on me , sewing my dresses . Frau Eberhardt was now really worried about my rheumatism . I must go to the doctor again , at once , this morning . This time he prescribed a program of electric massage . But I had plans for a program of my own . That evening a plate of soup fell from my hands , smashing on the dining-room floor . I wept . " I ca n't ! I ca n't ! " Herr Eberhardt soothed me . The electric massages would surely help . Meanwhile I must do only the lightest work , and rest every day . The following morning they were both solicitous . Frau Eberhardt stayed home and not only moved the heavy furniture but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned for me , more kind , as if I were truly becoming their daughter . I was in despair . I saw that I would have to make a drastic attack . On the sideboard was a Venetian vase , one of their most cherished and admired possessions . It was a memento of a trip they had taken in the early years of their marriage . Of cut crystal , shining like a great diamond , it was a beautiful piece of glassware , and yet I had to make up my mind to break it . I chose an afternoon when Frau Eberhardt was in the house . I  | was dusting . I picked up the vase , to wipe it , and it slipped from my fingers and was smashed . She came running . " Katarina ! " I burst out in anguish . " Send me away ! It fell from my fingers ; I ca n't feel anything . Oh , to have broken something so beautiful ! It had such memories for you ! I know it can never be replaced ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they merely sent me on another visit to the doctor . This time I asked him to give me a letter stating that I could no longer do housework . He stated only that I was to avoid lifting heavy things , or doing tasks that would strain my arms . I presented the letter to the Eberhardts and again suggested that they had best get another maid . No , no , they said . We would manage . Was I not like a daughter to them ? Meanwhile the formal notice from Vienna arrived , of my acceptance for Germanification , and Herr Eberhardt asked , " But , Katarina ! Have n't you received a reply to the letter you sent to your village ? " " No , " I said . And to me , that no meant much more . For if our Polish friends had not answered my last plea for information about my family , their silence was itself an answer  --  of death . Mother , Father , Yaacov were no longer there , no longer alive . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'll have to write to the German authorities there to forward your family records . That way we will be sure to get a reply , and promptly . " I said that the mails were slow because of the war . He need n't trouble . The records would surely arrive in a few days . Now all sorts of wild schemes went through my mind . I would have to get away from the Eberhardts , even if it meant burning down the house ! I would tell them I had contracted a dreadful  | social disease . But no , that was so easily checked on . I would ruin the meals , let the house get dirty . In my despair , I consulted Nina . All I could tell her was that they wanted to adopt me ; I said I feared that I would be tied to them , become their slave forever if the adoption went through . Oh , if I could only tell Nina my real reason , and how desperate things were for me ! Yet , Nina said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate matter to have me transferred , since they had not expressed dissatisfaction with me and were , on the contrary , so much attached to me . She could think of only one way . She would have to say that I was needed on the staff of the camp . She could say that there were no other girls with my language qualifications ? Ukrainian , Polish , Russian , and now German  --  who could type . Even though I was still afraid of being exposed to all the workers coming through the camp , I agreed . But on my next visit , Nina told me she had sounded out her chief and that he had refused . " Are the Eberhardts dissatisfied with her ? " he had asked . She had had to say no . " Then why make a change ? You can manage without her . " So now I had to find my own way . In the archway between the living room and dining room stood the Japanese vase . It was waist-high , with silver and blue and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their delicate hands , fanning themselves . This was the Eberhardts ' showpiece , far more valuable than the Venetian crystal . Once every month , in the big house-cleaning , the rug on which the vase stood had to be taken up and dragged out the back door to be beaten . The vase was meanwhile pulled aside , so that the rug could be lifted . For a few days I reported that the pain in my arms seemed to be diminishing under the electric treatment . That Friday , Frau Eberhardt forgot to offer to help me with the heavy task of  | rolling up the carpet and carrying it outside . I did not remind her , and she left the house . Afraid that I would lose courage , I went immediately to my job of destruction . I pulled the vase out on the stair landing , let it balance on the edge of the stairs , and then let go . It toppled down the back stairs , shattering . The foliage and dry cattails which it had contained spilled into the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my satchel . I brought it down and set it in the entrance hall . After that I completed my housework . Frau Eberhardt arrived home , saw my satchel in the entry , and called , " Katarina , what is this ? " I came to her , white-faced . " Frau Eberhardt , what happened today is too much . You and your husband have been so good to me , and I . . . I ca n't help breaking things ? " " But what has happened ? " She took a step into the living room and then rushed out to the back stairway . " Mein Gott ! What have you done ? " she wailed . " The Japanese vase ! " " The Japanese vase ! " I moaned . " First your Venetian crystal , your precious memento ! And now the Japanese vase ! I ca n't bear it ! " Frau Eberhardt had burst into tears . I had never seen her so truly undone , and now I too burst into tears . We stood there facing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I broke it ! I 've broken your most precious things ! " " You ca n't help it . You have worked your fingers to the bone for us . " " You have been so good to me , and I cause you only grief . " " What will become of you ? " We fell into each other 's arms . I could n't stop crying . Everything , everything , was behind my tears , even the realization of the most insane situation of all  --  that instead of suffering cruelty and  | hatred from the Germans , I should find my greatest danger coming from this couple who were kind to me . At last we were quiet . Nothing more was said until Herr Eberhardt came home . We were downstairs waiting for him . I had carried in the shards of the vase , in a vain effort to see if they could be glued together , and they now lay like a corpus delicti on the dining-room floor . He walked in , saw the remains , looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one piece on which a hand holding a fan had been broken off at the wrist . I felt not only like a murderer but like an utter barbarian . Herr Eberhardt said not a word . He walked upstairs to his study . This time I knew I had cut him to his very soul . He came down to dinner . He had prepared a letter to the Arbeitsamt , which he handed me . I took it to the kitchen and read it . The letter was warm , regretful . I was a fine girl and had proven a tireless worker , intelligent , cheerful , and of the best character . Unfortunately I had fallen ill and was no longer able to carry out my duties ; hence they were forced with the utmost regret to relinquish my services . They hoped that the Arbeitsamt could find me useful , light employment , suitable to the state of my health . health . I thanked them . I had been there for eight months , snug as in a bomb shelter . Now I must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bindermichel , Clava and Nina cried , " You 've done it ! " Nina hugged me . " Now you 'll stay with us ! What an idea , to be a housemaid ! " And when I told them about the Japanese vase , they shrieked with laughter . For a while I was dumfounded , and then I found myself laughing , too . We rollicked like schoolgirls . " But what 's wrong with your hands , really ? " Nina seized them , examining my fingers . " No wonder . It 's from keeping them in the water all day long , washing dishes , scrubbing floors . You 'll see , now you 're here , it 'll go away . " And strangely enough the pains did disappear , almost immediately . My life was completely changed . I no longer had privacy , it was true , but I had friends around me . Nina arranged for me to work in the office with herself and Clava ; after all , she had declared to the boss that she needed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three living in the same room , a room that , according to the regulations , could be occupied by only two . On the first night they had found me a bed in the same barracks ; my roommate was a young Frenchwoman , a translator . I would have the room practically to myself , Clava said , winking , since Jacqueline always came home late . Oh , there were ways to stay out after hours .  | I met Jacqueline in the morning , a very pretty girl with gorgeous reddish hair , extremely fussy about her clothes , vain of her elegance , untidy , and not a pleasant roommate . I kept out of her way . This was easy enough , with her busy nocturnal life . But a few nights later the situation happened to be reversed  --  I was the one who came home late , having been sitting up to all hours with Nina and Clava in their room . And as I entered I was startled . In the dim light that came from the hallway , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair . I let out a shriek . At this , Jacqueline sat up in bed , head and all . On the chair was a wig . Her own hair was clipped very close . Wearing a wig was the latest mode in Paris , she assured me . But I could n't get over the sight . When she had again fallen asleep , I went back to Nina and Clava and pulled them out of their beds . They sneaked into my room , and gawked . " The latest fashion ? " Clava tittered . In France , she had heard , the girls who went out with German soldiers were sometimes caught , and they got their hair clipped off . No wonder Jacqueline had volunteered to work in Germany . Perhaps Jacqueline sensed that I knew , for it became more and more unpleasant to room with her . Then Nina and Clava had a thought . Why should n't we have an extra cot moved into their room ? I was there all the time anyway . It would be crowded , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked . He even made a joke about it  --  so long as the third bed was not for a man , he would approve . And so I moved in , feeling safe and snug with my two friends . In the evenings , they would insist that I come out with them . Mostly they would go to the movies or stroll with their men . As Clava had to be careful not to be seen with Hans the Austrian , she had acquired a second friend , also named Hans . We called him Hans the Czech . And the girls twitted me about my handsome Hungarian . Soon , they said , they would find me another beau .  | " Ay , Katinka , " Nina would say , " you 'll see , you can even be happy here . We 'll find you a handsome young man . I 'll ask Karlus to look around . " I protested that I did n't want to get involved , yet I knew it was bound to happen sooner or later , and secretly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karlus . He was a quiet man , with a nice sense of humor ; he could take down someone with just a single word , a word that would send us into gales of laughter . He was what I thought of as a real man , dependable and devoted . Nina was always showing off little gifts that he managed to buy for her . He could n't buy anything expensive , but even if it was only a handkerchief or a scarf , Karlus would select it with a thought to her coloring , her gray-blue eyes , her personal taste . And he always managed to find little ways of surprising her with his gifts . Those two were truly in love . Although Nina kept up a mild pretense that they were just devoted friends and managed everything else quite discreetly , I knew quite well that Karlus was her lover . He lived in one of the camps for Czech workers , not the one across the street , but a lager at the Hermann Goering works , where he had been conscripted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a trifle sluttish , but in the most appealing way . Her face was round , soft , and her mouth had an expression about it , a looseness , that I imagined could be seen on prostitutes . She even talked like one ; her language was shockingly foul , a soldier 's language . Every word was preceded by a sex word , and yet in her this did n't really seem offensive . It was just Clava 's way . She had no temper whatsoever , was calm and agreeable , while Nina could fly into a temper over the slightest annoyance . Clava 's first Hans , the Austrian , was ugly , thin , with a sluggish speech that was almost defective , and with nothing interesting to say . He kept the canteen in the Czech camp across the road .  | " What on earth do you want with him ? " we would tease . " Oh , he gives me things . A girl has to have a man who will give her things . " They were not the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents  --  a radio , a wristwatch , a new dress , shoes . But still , it was not a pay relationship . Hans was a good soul , and she was truly fond of him . He was what my Papa would have called a nebish , a nobody , but warmhearted , and wonderfully helpful to the foreign workers . So , though we felt he somewhat lowered the tone of our company , Hans the Austrian was tolerated . Clava made no bones about her relationship ; she would manage to slip out after ten-o'clock curfew , through a gap in the fence on one side of the camp , where the barbed wire had been arranged in such a way that a piece could be detached  --  a convenience to which I had quickly been introduced . Clava would scuttle across the road and spend entire nights with Hans the Austrian , in the rear of his canteen , though it was , of course , a crime punishable by imprisonment for Hans to sully himself with a female of a lower race . Clava 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome physique for anything that was lacking in Hans the Austrian . Sometimes she alternated , breaking up with one while she went with the other , but for long periods she would be friendly to both . Even before coming to live in Bindermichel I had wondered how it was that I felt so close to these two young women who were after all so much more grown up than I. They had passed the border ; both had been married . Before leaving home I had never had close friends of this sort . There had always been a segregation between " those who knew " and the still-virgins , no matter how sophisticated the maidens pretended to be . Sometimes , with Nina and Clava , I felt that they cherished me , that we got on so well together , really , because every woman wants in her heart to  | pretend that she is still only a girl  --  just as Nina kept up the pretense that nothing actually happened between herself and Karlus . And even Clava pretended that all that , on the sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps , too , this remnant of girlishness was kept alive for Nina and Clava by our way of life together . We were like schoolgirls in a regulated dormitory , always scheming to break the rules , to stay out after hours . We were free to go in and out , provided we were in bed at ten . But even though one of the supervisors occasionally made the rounds to check the beds , this rule was regarded very lightly in the personnel barracks , for the veteran inhabitants , like Clava and Nina , had their understandings with the guards . And there was always the hole in the fence . The supervision was light enough , and the atmosphere was good , except for the presence of one elderly couple , a pair of White Russians who had lived in France . Both were poisonous tale-bearers and intriguers . They loved to make surprise visits at night . And they were dreadful anti-Semites , as well . One hardly ever heard Jews spoken about in the camp , but with them the word Jew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into their talk . They had a dangerous way of throwing the word at people they disliked . There was a dark-complexioned girl named Liza who worked in the kitchen , a generous-hearted girl who could always be counted on for a pot of tea . " Ach , Liza , that Jewess , " the Russian woman , Tamara , would say . " What ? You do n't think she looks Jewish ? She even acts Jewish . " So , although I would have liked to become friends with her , I was careful to steer clear of Liza . Of those two tale-bearers , I was most careful . Fortunately they were almost alone in their passion for intrigues . The head of the camp , an elderly Austrian named Seifert , was interested in nothing but efficient operation . All he wanted was for the transient workers to be quickly sorted out and sent to the right jobs , so that  | he would have no complaints from the various managements whom he supplied with labor . My work was on the reception team with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . Transports of workers would arrive at any hour of the day or night ; we would meet them and work straight through until everyone was registered . Just as I myself had gone through the inspection naked , so they came , lines of women , lines of men . And I found it equally embarrassing to be on the other side of the table . I could not raise my eyes to look a man in the face . Clava would tease me . After all , she would say , it would be less embarrassing for me to look up than down . But I told myself that if I kept my head down there would be less chance for anyone who happened to come from the region of Hrebenko to recognize me . On Sundays the three of us , perhaps with Karlus along , would take our rucksacks and board a small local train . We 'd get off at a siding less than an hour from Linz . Some of the farmhands imported from Italy had started their own little truck gardens there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lettuce , carrots , and the tomatoes I had once despised . Our diet in Bindermichel was altogether lacking in vegetables and greens . And then we would stroll the fields , dipping into our sacks to crunch the fresh vegetables , warm with their tang of the earth . Even fruit was to be had . On a lane off the main road , we came to know a little Austrian lady , a retired schoolteacher , who had plum trees on her tiny estate , as well as pears and apples . She sold her fruit only to the foreign workers , telling us how she sympathized , knowing that life was hard for us . So we would regale ourselves of a Sunday . During the week , the men would come along the fence to  | whistle for their dates , as we were not allowed to have them visit us in the barracks . Sometimes when Nina and Clava were going out , I would insist on staying home , as I did not want to be a fifth wheel on every date . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow me to sit at home alone ; besides , Nina said , Karlus already had a ticket for me to go with them to the movies . So I dressed and joined them . At the theater , Karlus met a friend who happened to have the seat next to ours . Slavek was his name , and he also happened to be a draftsman like Karlus , and also happened to be a Czech , and even happened to work in the very same shop as Karlus . I glanced up at Slavek . Though I am fairly tall for a girl , he was even taller for a man . And there was a handsome fellow ! No need to look at the screen ! He was just like one of those devil-may-care movie stars , with soft brown eyes , a piquant mouth , and a sort of glow , a glow of life . Only , he did n't seem particularly interested in me . He was n't even looking . Our seats were close to the screen , in the third or fourth row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen toward us , so that I could see him quite plainly . I found that I was n't watching the movie . I was looking at him . And I was n't the only one . There were other girls around me whose heads were turned . As for my cavalier , he calmly watched the picture . Afterward we went for the usual stroll . He paid no particular attention to me , and I felt suddenly lumpish . I was no coquette . I did n't know how to attract a man . Indeed , this Slavek had a terribly annoying way of looking around at other women , remarking , " There 's a pretty girl ! " And so we separated at our fence , and there was nothing . No talk of meeting again . Yet I could n't help chattering to Nina . What a handsome fellow !  | " You see ! " she said . " If I get you someone , he 's someone ! " I had no way to measure my feelings . I had to reach back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when a high-school girl had let herself be embraced by her teacher . Then , I had felt myself being led on , led on by a man , and I had responded more out of curiosity to discover if I would feel anything than out of a true longing for him . Now I was surprised how in the midst of my work , in the midst of my chatter with the girls , in the midst of every thought , the longing stayed in me ; it was a new condition in my life . It was like everything everyone had ever said , and yet it was more , more . And this was happening to me even here , in the midst of my hiding and my anxiety ! This part of life was not being denied to me , nor could it be escaped . Two days later , Nina was getting ready for her date with Karlus . We heard his whistle . She looked out the window . " Katya , you 'd better get dressed . Slavek is with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the four of us . But Slavek was in no way like the good Karlus . Slavek was impulsive , crazy . He might turn up at ten in the morning , unexpectedly , having somehow got away from his job . He would whistle or even shout my name , or demand of some girl inside the gate , " Go to the office and tell Katya to come out . " I 'd make some excuse and get away for a minute . He 'd want me to come to town . Sometimes I even managed it . And in town he was likely to do anything . I was still quite shy ; I did n't like even to hold a man 's arm in the street . " Take my arm ! " Slavek would demand . " If you do n't , I 'll walk on my hands , right here in the middle of town ! " And if I refused  --  as I discovered the one time I did refuse  --  hup ! there he was , walking on his hands ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took his arm . He pulled me close to his side . And I knew that strange , heady feeling , in early love , perhaps more exquisite than kissing , than close embrace  --  that tender , excited feeling of the limbs , walking together . There on the street in Linz I suddenly remembered my girlish questionings with Alla , about " feeling anything " with a man . Now I could really have told her . Where were they now , Alla and Milla , so I could run and say , " Everything before was childishness . Only now I know ; I know how it feels . " And like some balance of pain for love , the thought of them was with me again , constantly . What was happening to them , there in Hrebenko ? What had happened ? It was like staring out into some absolutely dark night , listening for some sign of life . Once , a transport of workers came from Galicia , with Ukrainians from the region of Lwow . Unable to restrain myself , I risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? " " Hard , hard . " My head pounding , I dared . " But at least , I hear , they 've finally finished with the Jews . " " Oh , there 's not a Jew left . They 've all been burned to death . Their houses , everything burned . " I was seeing Slavek every day . He was irrepressible , a real bandit , a bohemian . I would have wanted him different . I wanted him to be respectable , like Karlus . Karlus was always carefully dressed ; he even wore cuff links . Slavek wore unpressed pants , a weird jacket with a slit in the back . His hat was twisted into some crazy shape and tilted so that a curl peeped out . Karlus always  | arrived on the dot ; Slavek might show up an hour late , or even an hour early . That , I liked . I fussed , objected , told him he 'd get me into trouble , but it was always a thrill when he appeared unexpectedly . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and I was in bed . And I would go out to him , risking the terrible vengeance of the White Russian , who might come around with his flashlight to check the beds . Already he had caught Clava , and he had reported that she was said to be going out with an Austrian named Hans . She had been called to the Gestapo , but had talked her way out , declaring that everyone knew her friend Hans was a Czech . Yet none of these dangers deterred me . When Slavek whistled , out I went ! Nor did Slavek bring me little gifts , such as Karlus brought to Nina . Slavek was not considerate but bossy , a dictator . He began to tell me what to wear , what not to wear , how to comb my hair . Ugh , that Polish peasant hair-do ! I must comb my hair off my forehead , in the Czech fashion . There ! It made me look more womanly . And then he began to demand , Why did n't I use makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? This had been a matter of absolute principle with me . As a young girl , I had made a code of " being myself . " Tauba too , and several of the girls in our circle , had believed in this code and had scorned the use of cosmetics as deceitful . A man should love a woman for what she was . That was our credo . We were derisive of Milla when she appeared at school with her cheeks rouged , and all the girls who copied her we branded as brainless . Ours was the real sophistication ! Besides , I had always thought , since I had such high natural coloring , what did I need with cosmetics ? But now Slavek began to pester me . No wonder I was such a prude . I was even afraid to use lipstick . And he got Nina to join in the campaign . " What does it hurt ? Put on a little make-up ! "  | " A man must love a woman for what she is , " I announced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smears and daubs . " " Do n't be so stubborn , Katinka ! " She laughed . " Be what you are , but add a bit . " One Sunday when the four of us were out on an excursion , Slavek produced a lipstick from his pocket . He caught hold of me , and while the others hooted , he smeared it on thick . " There ! Now maybe you 'll become a woman ! " He had of course from the first frankly embarked on the campaign of " making me a woman . " And just as frankly I had told him that this was excluded . If he wanted to go out with me , it had to be with such an understanding . Why ? I would argue with myself . What was I waiting for ? Never again would I live in that ordered life of my childhood where a girl could expect to fall in love and get married . Like everyone else , I had now to forgo the rule I had absorbed from the first moment of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my husband . Surely it had been only natural , in Hrebenko , to believe that I would never marry except for love , and that when I was in love I would marry , and so the rule about making love had n't seemed prudish at all . But now I was no longer sure what was honest . If I was in love , it was only honest to yield . And yet I could n't . Perhaps it was a desperate clinging to all that was left to me of home . It was as though by giving way I would at last admit that my mother was dead . We went out more than once on overnight excursions to the mountains . I would remind Slavek in advance : " Slavek , I do n't want you to be disappointed . I do n't want us to go if you think it will be any different . " Of course he would agree to behave , and I would know he meant to change me if he could . Once we went to climb the Feuerkugel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was so warm we had to take off our coats , and yet there was snow on the mountainside , and the peak was covered with snow . There were cable cars , but a long line had formed , and it looked like a three-hour wait . " Come on ! " Slavek called , and he started up like a goat , afoot . Though we were n't dressed for it , we followed . He leaped and cavorted ahead of us , came catapulting back down the mountainside to seize me by the hand and drag me along with him . Soon we had reached the snow line . On , on ! he commanded . He dragged me into the snow , till it filled my shoes ; he went back and dragged the others . We romped in the snow like children , washing each other 's faces , throwing snowballs ; we plunged into drifts ankle-deep . Suddenly Slavek appeared on a huge boulder , near the mountain top . He stepped to the edge , there above us , flung out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I , Slavek , and the universe is mine ! " Who but Slavek could do it , a conscripted worker in a foreign land , living behind barbed wire . Laughing , we plodded through the snow , we girls in our thin shoes and dresses , until we came to the peak . We took off our soaked shoes , our stockings , the men rubbed our feet , and then we sat in the sun . Afterward we had coffee in the Gasthaus , and danced there . And on the way down , this time by cable car , we all sang , but in the whole medley of voices I heard only Slavek 's , so vibrant , so charged with life ! And everybody looked at us . We had become tanned up there in that one afternoon of sunshine ; we glowed , and who could say but we were four happy people ! That night we stayed over , at an inn . We took two rooms , but as Nina still kept up her pretenses , it was with the understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the other . Before  | going to bed , we walked in the dark fields , and Nina and Karlus drifted away . Then Slavek and I fought . Only once before , I had known something of this , and then it had not been the same . Not long after the Russians had come to Hrebenko , and I had made trips to Lwow for Papa , to replenish the vodka supply , there had come one time when I had been given a ride back from Lwow , with my sack of bottles , in a small truck driven by a sort of sergeant . There had been a second one , who had got into the back of the truck with me . And along the way he had suddenly seized me , and I had fought him . Silently , almost impassively , intently , he had exerted his strength , and it had been almost as though there was a rule to our battle , that a man was allowed to force a girl , simply if he were able to . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck lurched I had broken out of his hold and tried to leap . And only then , in that moment , I had screamed . The driver had stopped the truck and come back to see what had happened ; then he had laughed and called to his comrade to let me alone , and to come and sit with him , in front . And that had been the end of it . I had never told it at home . The scratches on my face and arms , I had told 1vlama , had come from the lowhanging branches of a tree , under which the truck had passed . And I had run up to my room , for it was still the time when Tauba and I lived in our third-floor room . I had crept into my bed , and shivered , and wept , for I had felt then that I knew what it meant to be a woman . Tauba had come , and stroked me , but I had n't been able to tell her what had happened . Until much later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms , and we had clung to each other , as sisters . But now with Slavek , it was a different fight . This time I was fighting the man and myself , too . I writhed within myself . And my anger at myself made me only more violent toward him . I struck him , hard , and he let go of me.  | For several days we did n't see each other . Partly , I was angry because I knew that Slavek went out with many girls . Oh , he had a great reputation among the foreign workers . It was said that even a number of respectable German women of Linz had had their meetings with Slavek . And if it was not with respectable married women , or with girls from the workers ' camps , then it was with prostitutes . One night I had to talk it out , with Nina and Karlus . " Katya , " Karlus said , " I must tell you one thing . I know him well . Slavek has never gone with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always only to go to bed . If a girl goes , fine . If not , next day there 's another . " " Then why did you bring him to me , if you knew he was that kind ? " " Even such a man longs for a girl with whom he can stay for good . " I wanted to cry . I wanted to run to Slavek wherever he was . And yet I said , " Karlus , then why is it , there are times when we all go out together , and you two boys bring us home to the barracks and then you go off  --  Karlus , at those times , he does n't always go home to the lager with you . " " No , he goes off by himself , " Karlus said . He looked me directly in the eyes ; I could no longer be naive . And all day long , in my tension , I kept wondering . Could it be for Slavek as for me , even though he went to bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though all life were suspended because of our separation ? So we met again . We walked hand in hand , on that path away from the barracks , away from the city , into the fields . We stood and embraced , and I felt terribly dismayed , helpless , and I could n't help bringing up all those things to Slavek , about the rest of his life . " What do you think , I 'm made of wood ? " he snapped . And then , holding me by the shoulders , " If that was all I wanted , why would  | I come to you , where I know I wo n't get it ! " He struck himself on the forehead . " Ach , Slavek ! You had to go and fall in love with a Katinka , with such a little Ukrainian oxhead ! " And all that night on my cot I kept hearing those words , better than a whispered " I love you . " Those words of admission to himself that he was in love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to see them as a couple , Slavek and Katinka . He was standing there in the woods embracing her ; they were melted together . Slavek and Katinka . Katinka . Not Eva . And all at once it seemed clear to me  --  that was why . That was why I had not been able to free myself for complete intimacy with him . For I wanted him to love me , Eva . Eva . To know me truly , the person that I was in truth . And then a terribly insistent urge took hold of me . With my incessant dreaming and thinking of Slavek , day and night , was mingled an unending urge to tell him I was Eva , a Jewish girl . Not Katinka , his little Ukrainian oxhead , but Eva . I could n't shake myself free of this idea , any more than I could shake myself free of my endless longing to be with Slavek , to see him , to have him make me angry with his antics , to have him touch me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know me , to love me for myself . I was sure of him , and yet how could I reveal this terrible , mortal secret that I had kept for a whole , long year ? Nina and Clava were as close to me as sisters . Could I tell them ? Surely not . I could not burden them with it . Slavek would never betray me , no matter what happened between us , of that I was sure . But , drunken , sometime , or in the arms of some slut ? No , no , I was being unfair to him ! But there came another fear . Suppose I told him . Would it make  | me someone different to him , someone strange ? When he lost his Katinka , would he still want to be with me , with Eva ? And meanwhile , perhaps because I was thinking so constantly of this , there came the only fright that I had had in a long while . A Polish worker , in his interview with me , suddenly remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That soft R  --  that 's the way the Jews talk . " No , if he meant anything by it , he would n't have said it to me but to others . He had told me he was from Katowitz , in the south . I mentioned a city in the north . " I come from Poznan , " I said . " That 's how we talk in Poznan . " He kept on . What a funny way they talk in Poznan ! What an R ! And then I realized what an idiot I had been . Suppose he mentioned the incident around the camp and repeated that I had said I came from Poznan ? In the records , I came from the opposite end of Poland ! That very day , I placed him in a factory , to get him out of Bindermichel . But from my reawakened fear , there came a new thought , in my worries about Slavek . If he truly loved me , if we should become bound together , he had a right to know everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were caught . Before having anything more to do with me , he should know this risk . And so I determined to tell him . I set it in my mind , that it would have to be on a special day . I was making over my good dress , according to a pattern in one of the fashion books that Jacqueline had brought from France . For since I had moved out of her room , we had become friends . I told  | myself that the special day , when I told Slavek my secret , would be the day on which I wore my new dress . I would look elegant . Eva would have the best of opportunities for herself . He was outside , calling for his Katya . It was twilight , and as I came out in my new , shining dress , Slavek seized me and whirled inc around , there on the street in front of the camp gate , calling to the guards , to everyone , " Look ! Look at Katya ! There 's a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . We had to celebrate , Slavek insisted . We 'd go to the Rosenstube and dance ! No , I said , I did n't feel like going into town . I wanted to walk the other way , toward the country . What ! With a new dress ? There was his contrary Katya ! If Slavek says left , Katya has to say right . If Slavek says the city , Katya has to say the country , even though she 's dying to go to town . I was so tense with my plan that I could n't even squabble with him . Slavek must have sensed that something unusual was in the air . He wheeled and walked down the road , and I had to walk quickly to keep up with him . I was silent . We passed the edge of town . The sun was setting ; the whole sky was red , the haze around us was reddish . We turned off the road , down our favorite path . We were always so gay when we came here , teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " How could I say it ? Blurt out the words ? I walked a little farther , then halted and drew him aside , among the trees . I put my hand against his chest . " Slavek , I know that you love me enough so that I can tell you something about myself without the least worry . " " Well , what is it ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? " " I want to tell you . . . Slavek , I 'm Jewish . "  | He looked at me , his eyes burning in that still-reddish light . And he said , " What of it ? " " But , Slavek ? " " But what ? What does it matter to me if you are Jewish ? " He saw the tears in my eyes , and he put his hands on my shoulders , hard . " Now I love you doubly . Oh , yes . Now I see . Because you really love me , you had to tell me this . Katya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katya , " I whispered . " I 'm Eva . My name is Eva . " He repeated it softly . " Eva . " And as he said my name , an overwhelming joy rose in me , a bubbling feeling of release , something such as I imagined I would feel if the whole war ended and the world was at peace . It was foolish , foolish , I told myself , to feel so much over so simple a thing . But the tears burst now , flowing , and he kissed the tears on my face , holding me , fondling me with a new tenderness , repeating the name in a hundred endearing diminutives , " Eva , Evaleh , Evinka , Eva . " Then we sat down on a fallen tree trunk , and everything burst from me . I told Slavek of my family , my hopeless fears for all of them , except perhaps my sister Tauba , who might be alive with the partisans . But my mother , my father , my little brother , were surely gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Slavek swore that we would one day find him . As soon as the war was over we would be married ; first he would take me back to Prague to his parents ; he would work , earn a great deal of money , even get rich  --  he had all sorts of ideas for inventions  --  and then we would visit my brother . Why , we would even go to live in Palestine ! He pressed my hands . " Eva , Evinka , if ever a time should come when you are in danger , you must tell me at once . " " If that time comes , nothing can be done . I would want only one thing  --  that you should not become involved . " " No ! You must tell me , " he insisted . " We have ways . " I knew that some kind of an underground existed among the  | Czechs ; they had a hidden little radio on which they listened to foreign broadcasts . But how could they possibly help anyone who was caught as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would get to Czechoslovakia somehow , and we would be hidden by his parents . Perhaps we should even go now , right away , without waiting . No , no , I said . That would only call them down on us . So far , nothing had happened . The more time passed , the less likely it was that anything would happen . And just now , the war was going a bit better . Then suddenly he laughed . Without even knowing why , I laughed with him . I felt so happy . " Evinka , now I understand , " he said . " What ? " " There 's always been a saying with us  --  Jewish girls are the hardest to get . " I pulled away my hand . He put his arm around me . Still , I had to laugh with him again . It was a compliment . I was a good Jewish daughter , after all . And now , the next days were heavenly . Slavek treated me with such tenderness ! A new delicacy appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , once after the four of us had been out together and she and I were getting ready for bed , " You know , Katya , whatever it was with him until now , Slavek is really in love with you now . He 's like a man just before marriage . " There was such a softness in her voice , I knew she was thinking about her own husband , of whom she spoke so little . She caught my eyes . Then her tone became lighter . " He 's even ceased to bother you . "  | It was true . Slavek had ceased to press me , that way , and for my part , I did n't even think about whether he was going with other girls , for that had suddenly ceased to matter . I was at peace . Slavek had gone to Vienna to arrange some documents about things at home in Czechoslovakia ; he was gone for two days and when he returned he had a gift for me . What could it be ? He teased me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put his hand into his pocket and brought out some folded slips of paper . Ration coupons for dress goods ! Only Slavek would have thought of such a gift ! It was comical , and yet it was just right . He had spent all his money on the black market for these coupons . There were four , each valid for a meter of cloth . Since it was forbidden to buy cloth except to be used in mending , only a single meter of any one pattern could be bought . I went from shop to shop in Linz , and in each of three shops I bought a meter of the same elegant black fabric . In the fourth , I used my last coupon for red silk trim . Night after night we girls pored over Jacqueline 's fashion magazines . Finally a pattern was decided on . I sewed as though it were to be my wedding dress . And I was satisfied . The dress was stunning . Black was always in the height of fashion in Paris , Jacqueline assured me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red cheeks . I even had enough material for a hat , and so my costume was complete . I had finished it in time for a great occasion . The four of us were going on a weekend trip to visit Anya . Slavek was irrepressible . He announced that his Katya was the belle of Bindermichel , and he posed me at the gate while he took snapshots , as though I were a fashion model . And so we took the train . I had been to Steinkeller several times , and Anya had come to Linz , so that it was well established that we were old friends ; there seemed less and less to fear . Anya was still alone ; she had  | thought it best to keep her distance from the farmhands , and so our visits were almost her whole social life . Anya met us at the station , beaming . This time , it turned out , she had outdone herself . She had rented a room in a near-by village so as to be away from the estate . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our weekend . The room was in a farmhouse , one of those ample , peaceful houses that seem untouched by war or by any outside catastrophe . The farmer 's wife , good-hearted , fat , welcomed us and laughingly asked where the third young man was . She made sure we had everything we wanted and then kept out of our way . The room was vast . Side by side stood two grand double beds , topped with the customary mountains of feather quilts and pillows . At the foot of the two beds was a cot . Everything smelled fresh ; the house was Sunday-scrubbed . We looked at the beds and looked at one another . We laughed , and everyone said there was safety in numbers . On a round table , Anya had prepared our feast . She had brought every imaginable delicacy : roast goose , and wonderful sausages of three kinds , butter , and goose fat , and jellies , and pears , and liver pate , wonderful Viennese cream cakes , and tarts , fresh cream , real coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bottles of beer and wine . We told jokes . Slavek knew all the latest Hitler jokes . And there were new jokes about the troubles of the Germans in Russia . We sang , we danced . And as it grew late we made more and more jokes about the beds . Anya laughed maliciously , saying she had no problem . The cot was hers . As for the two large beds  --  well , we could n't deny that she had provided plenty of room . The men were driven out while we undressed . I still did not know for sure how things would be arranged . There are moments , times in our lives , when it seems that just some little clumsiness about the way things are arranged makes a fateful difference .  | Everything had been so gay until now , I felt so immersed in happiness , in Slavek 's love , in the love of my friends , that the whole occasion was like a wedding party . Surely never in my life would the time again be so good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything would have happened naturally . And perhaps the presence of Anya , even in another room , still would have held me , like an admonition from home . Any -a lay down on her cot and merrily bid us good night . The men returned , in their pajamas . Nina looked at me quietly , even with a tiny smile of compassion and , sitting down on one of the large beds , said , " Karlus and I will sleep here . Is that all right , Katarina ? " I knew already , with a dreadful feeling of disappointment in myself , with a sorrow over the circumstances , that it was not all right . Not like this , half in jest , for our beginning . Oh , why had n't something happened to arrange this differently ? And yet in another part of me I was dreadfully grateful ; I had a feeling that things had to be this way so that I would be spared , so that I could still be faithful for a while to everything Mother wanted  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would not let myself feel spared because Slavek was not Jewish . For if I truly loved .. . No , it was the image of a real marriage in a settled world that I was clinging to ; for that , I had been spared . It was the image of a girl who was waiting for her husband , who believed in the solemnity of marriage as well as the joy . Otherwise , everything would be spoiled for her . And so we lay together that night , a dreadful night . He whispered , " Eva . " I closed his lips with my fingers . He bit them . I drew away . In the next bed , Nina , heavy with wine , was asleep in the arms of her Karlus , and soon we heard him , too , snoring gently . With Slavek I kept up a whispered struggle . No , no , not like this , not  | here . And then I pretended to sleep , but I felt his wakefulness , and then he said bitter things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he apologized , grew tender again , and I wanted him , I tried to sleep in his arms but knew his torture and drew away . Then I must have half slept , for a distorted whirl of thoughts and images kept passing through my mind ; at moments it was even as if Tauba were there in the cot where Anya lay , and if I bent down to her and touched her it would be my sister . And still in half sleep I told myself , No , no . It 's a dream . And then what held me from reaching to touch her was the fear that I would prove my dream and know Tauba was gone , and then I was fully awake and I heard every creak and whisper of the house but kept my eyes closed and pretended still to be asleep because Slavek was lying open-eyed beside me , smoking a cigarette . In the morning we were moody , silent . We all tried to retrieve our gaiety , marveling over the good things for breakfast , but our lightheartedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , and we could scarcely think of anything to say to each other . We uttered the most banal remarks , about the weather , about the trees . It made my heart heavy for Anya , that all her efforts were spoiled ; I even hoped Slavek would flirt with her . But the spirit was gone . We attributed our mood to tiredness . At last it was time for the train . I begged Anya to come to see me soon at Bindermichel . On the train , too , Slavek and I could find little to say to each other . We had lost contact . I even prepared words . I would declare that I was sorry , that it was my fault , that I knew I had to make up my mind one way or the other , but because of the way I had been raised . . . I remained silent . When we parted at the Bindermichel gate , instead of asking to  | see me the next day , Slavek said the day after , and then I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day all day long when I was n't with him , it was the same as before ; my longing was incessant . And then once he was to meet me after work , and I waited and he did n't appear at all . I told myself it was good that I had failed to give myself to him , because with him , it had n't really been love . And I went into the barracks and went to bed and wept . Nothing any longer seemed important ; to remain uncaught , to live , to see the end of the war  --  all this dreadful struggle for life seemed a ridiculous pretense , some artificial comedy , and the only reality was that I was a girl in love , and that I had not known how to keep my lover . The next day when Karlus came for Nina , he called out that he had something to tell me . I went to the gate with her . Slavek had gone to Vienna for a few days , Karlus said , and had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavek did not return . And then one of the girls in the office laughingly remarked , " Have you been to the hospital to see your Slavek ? " What ? Did n't I know ? She had been to visit a friend in the hospital  --  why , yes , right here in Linz  --  and there was Slavek . Oh , nothing serious ; he claimed to have hurt his leg . I confronted Karlus . Yes , it was true , he admitted . Slavek had wanted to spare me from worrying , but he had hurt his leg in a fall and was in the local hospital . " Then I 'll go to see him , " I said . It was not a visiting day , but through the fence I saw him in the yard . He appeared indeed to be having trouble with his leg . I called to him , and Slavek came , half limping , to the fence . " But what happened to you ? Why did you have to tell me that story about going to Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bit embarrassed and yet  | amused . " Well . . . I fell , " he said , and laughed . " A few more days and I 'll be cured . " All at once I felt myself blushing . I understood . I recalled how often he had pleaded , " You know I 'm not made of wood . " I could feel only fury at Slavek , at myself , at the way people were made , at the conditions in which we had to live . Everything was so repulsive ; why was the most beautiful part of life made so ugly ? It was as though I had unknowingly put my hand into something slimy . I told him I understood ; I was sorry . And I went home . One morning while I was at work , Clava came in and said , " Slavek is waiting for you at the bridge . " Unchanged ! In spite of everything , to demand me like that , in the midst of working hours . Nevertheless I went to Herr Seifert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna ; he 's been ill for some time and he 's just back . He wants to see me for a few minutes . He 's waiting on the bridge . " Herr Seifert looked at me , as a man who knows what it is to have to deal with women . " All right , Katya , go and see your friend . " I approached , determined to keep down my excitement . " Well , how was it , " I asked sarcastically , " in Vienna ? " " Oh , I had a miserable time . " Slavek laughed . " And how is your leg ? Is it better now ? " " Yes , the cure was complete , " he said . And for a moment longer we kept up our remarks . Then he burst out angrily , " Katya , you know what it was . You ca n't leave me over a thing like that . " We tried again . We met . We walked . But the true moment had been lost . One night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . He was silent .  | Then for weeks I remained in my room all the time I was n't at work . I managed even to take my meals alone . I refused to go out with Nina and Clava , refused the dates they offered to arrange for me . Then , one night I did go out , with the whole band  --  Karlus , Nina , Clava , and Hans the Czech . We went to the Centralkino , and afterward we sat in a cafe , and there was Slavek with a band of his own , two girls among them . He came over to us and we chatted a bit , almost formally , like distant friends , and then he went back to his own group . The girls were attractive ... . The winter months passed in a kind of deadness . Once , Karlus came with a bright face and a pot of jam , for a celebration . The Allies , he whispered , had landed in North Africa . The might of America would now be felt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far from us . How could that save anyone now ? As Karlus gave us his bits of news , I found myself listening , instead , with a secret hope that he might drop some word about Slavek , relate some new tale about that crazy Slavek 's exploits , even tell about Slavek 's affairs with women . But , perhaps out of consideration for my feelings , the name never passed his lips . Presently something happened that made me realize I could not be just a girl mooning for her love ; I was brought back to the reality of my situation . One day in the office Herr Seifert called me to his desk and said he had just received a call from the Gestapo . They wanted to see me . He gave the name of the officer , the room number , and said the appointment was for three o'clock . I had two hours . And during all that time , a certain thought stood before my mind . It was as when you shut your eyes to  | some nightmare vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know it is false and yet it persists . It stands there . Even my fear was blocked out by this dreadful thought . I knew in my heart that Slavek could not have betrayed me to the Gestapo . And yet the worst horror in all our helplessness is in the things that come unwanted to the mind . Even one 's deepest feelings are smeared with distrust . If he could not have done it deliberately , my mind kept insisting , he might still have betrayed me by accident . He was the only one who knew . Perhaps he had accidentally spoken my name ? Before some girl ? A scene arose , complete , in my imagination . I saw Slavek lying with some girl , and she was a girl truly in love with him  --  oh , I could believe that well enough . And perhaps it was so , that Slavek longed for me . And perhaps in his love-making with her , he called out my name , my real name , Eva . Evinka . I had read of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , Slavek , Slavek , night after night in my restlessness , with my very skin crying out for him ? But even as this imagined scene struck a doubled pain in me , I tried to examine it sensibly . Suppose such a thing had happened . Suppose he had called out for Eva . How could any girl have known it was I , Katya ? No , but a girl who was familiar with all the gossip in the camp  --  almost any girl among the foreign workers ? would know that Slavek had been going out steadily , for months , with Katya , and if the girl loved Slavek she would instantly feel it was Katya that he wanted , Katya whose name he called , under that Jewish name . But why Jewish ? Suddenly the whole ugly scene was blown away in a simple thought . Eva was not necessarily a Jewish name . What of Meister Klein 's mistress , brought to Hrebenko ? Her name , too , had been Eva . And I almost laughed out loud . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was as though every  | cause for despair was gone , almost as though I had not even been called to the Gestapo . And then I tried to fathom the message . What of my chief in the office ? Why had he given me the message as though it were utterly routine ? Did he perhaps know the reason for the summons , and know that it was of little consequence ? Or did he already know that I was being accused of being Jewish ? And was his offhand manner a bad sign ? For , surely , no one took a call from the Gestapo lightly . There even passed through my mind that incident with the seemingly stupid Pole who had kept puzzling over my R. And I had told him that I came from Poznan . How idiotic of me to have felt so superior , to have become careless with him because he appeared stupid . Suppose it had been a pose , to catch me off guard ? Or suppose he had babbled about his interview and someone like the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Poznan when I was from the south of Poland ? But that incident had taken place months ago ! No matter . They might , all this time , have been checking . So I tormented myself . But once on the way , I forbade myself any nervousness . I must be calm , self-possessed . I must show no sign of worry . The building was in the center of Linz . Just inside the entrance was a reception desk . There was nothing sinister about the place ; it looked like any other office building . I gave my name , and the name of the person I had been told to see , Herr Kroll . She telephoned , confirmed the appointment . I walked up to the second floor . As I passed an open door I happened to glance in and saw a long room with several men standing with their faces to the wall . I came to the Foreign Workers Section . Opening the proper door , I found myself in an ordinary office occupied by two young men in civilian clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , glancing through an open folder . They greeted me pleasantly  | enough , even courteously , asked me to sit down , and the one behind the desk , Kroll , began with routine questions . My name was Katarina Leszczyszyn . I worked in the registration office at the Durchgangslager . How long had I been there ? Nine months , yes . And I roomed in the personnel barracks . I shared a room with two other young women , Clava Kriloff and Nina Ilanova . They were also my intimate friends ? Yes . I was quite close to Nina ? For one deathly moment I thought , Even she ? If Nina had betrayed me , I would rather die than live in such a world . But now he was asking , What did I know of Nina 's background ? Where she had come from , what she had done there ? And suddenly the curtain of the play was open for me . It was not about myself ! So they were concerned with Nina ! As though coming up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dazed feeling from my head . I must be just as sharp , just as clever , in protecting Nina as in struggling for my own life . Only now , feeling safe for myself , I could be stronger . What could they want of Nina ? I said only that I knew she came from Kharkov , and that she had studied philology at the university . " Did you know that she was Jewish ? " I stared at them . Nina ? Jewish ? My dumfoundedness was genuine , for this really struck me as absurd . If there was anything Jewish in her , I would surely have sensed it ! And now I saw the double absurdity in the situation . I had feared they would accuse me , a Jewess , of being Jewish , and instead they were accusing Nina , a gentile ! And accusing her to me , as though I were one of them ! " We have good reason to suspect her of being a Jewess , " Herr Kroll went on , " and we believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I held back my feeling of revulsion . Wait . Perhaps they had only a suspicion . Someone had lodged a suspicion . Who ? And  | how could anyone possibly see anything Jewish in Nina ? A golden blonde , blue-eyed , with a fair , almost milk-white skin , and a calm , cultured manner that was anything but what one thought of as Jewish . But the golden hair  --  it was bleached . I had often seen Nina bleaching her hair and had thought nothing of it ; blond hair easily becomes dull , and she was bleaching it to give it tone . Could there be a possibility of truth in the accusation ? Would I help them , Herr Kroll repeated , pointing out that I was ideally situated for the task ; I was Nina 's closest confidante , we often went out together with our young men  --  they knew that much , then  --  and I was in a position to watch her every word and move , without her having the slightest suspicion . My first impulse was to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing to find out ! But if I did that , they might turn to someone else to spy on her . And if she really was Jewish , I had to do everything in my power to help her . Even had she not been Nina , this would have been true . For anyone . If there was a risk , I would have to take it , but actually it seemed to me that I would be protected by this task . If they thought of Katya as someone who would spy out a Jew , then they would have no suspicion of Katya . " Of course , I 'm just the one who can find out , " I declared . " If she 's Jewish , she 'll give herself away . I knew Jews in school , in Poland ; there were several of them in our high school  --  they have a way of getting in everywhere  --  and if I watch her closely , and she 's Jewish , I 'm bound to find out . It 's true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't really watching for anything of that kind . Am I permitted to know just what is already known about her ? " No , said Herr Kroll , that would be of no help to me . But he was glad that I would undertake the task . And he went on to tell me how important it was . The Jews were the worst enemies of mankind , they were all Communists , and the Communists were all  | Jews , and the Reich was engaged in a great crusade to rid the world forever of this pestilence . I said I knew . Then the matter was settled , Herr Kroll said , closing the folder . I would send him a weekly report with full details of my progress . I saluted , Heil Hitler , and left . Instead of taking the tram , I walked slowly back to the lager , through all of Linz . I had to put off that moment when I would face Nina , not knowing whether I should at once warn her of this , or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should keep it entirely to myself . The Gestapo had only a suspicion . If they had real proof they would not have set me to spy on her . And where could they get proof ? Already , as winter broke , Karlus had brought great news . The war was turning , there in Russia . The Germans had broken their heads at Stalingrad . The Russians were counterattacking to drive the Germans from their soil . Nina 's home city was already free , retaken . And if so , the Gestapo could no longer send for her family records ! Without records they could prove nothing . Nothing . And at that moment I recalled my own examination by that great board of scientists in Vienna , and I felt a little better . Yes , yes ! If the war was turning , we had only to stay close together and wait . If I would protect Nina for the next few months , perhaps by the summer of 1943 the Americans would come and free us ! Nina was home in our room . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she chattered with Clava , I felt reassured . Yet I wondered how it would be to look at her in this new way , with a question in my mind . Everything was normal . As I entered , I joined their talk . Clava was in trouble again . Her period was several weeks late , but she did n't know whether to start to take her " medicine , " a recipe of her own , a horrible peroxide concoction that had " always worked . " Nina scolded her . I joined in as though I too were an experienced  | woman . She would one day poison herself . She would never be able to bear children . And what a slut she was with her two Hanses . Oh , Clava laughed , at least she could safely call the child Hans ! And all the while I was feeling lighter in my heart , for even looking at Nina with the eyes of suspicion , even with the severe test of my own feeling that I could always sense a Jew , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be Jewish . She was completely , typically Russian . No one seemed to be aware that I had been summoned to the Gestapo . Herr Seifert had been discreet . And so , for a week , I did nothing . At the end of the week I wrote a long , detailed report . I was proceeding with caution , I said , so as not to arouse the subject 's suspicions . But I was observing her more closely than ever and trying whenever possible to introduce into our conservation subjects that would lead her to give herself away . So far , there had not been the slightest evidence . If she was a Jewess , she was an extremely clever one . I would redouble my efforts . And so another week went by . And I wrote another report . I told how I had engaged Nina in conversation about her childhood , her schooling . I said it was not possible as yet to come to a firm conclusion either way . There was still more I wanted to learn , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was as yet no sign that she was Jewish , but I could not be absolutely sure that she was not . And so on , and on . They called me once more to the office . We went over my reports line by line . One thing heartened me . The Gestapo seemed to be quite careful about such an accusation . They did not want to make a mistake and take any Christian for a Jew . " What 's your impression ? " asked Herr Kroll . I was dreadfully tempted to say , " I 'm sure she 's not a Jew . " Yet I wanted them to feel , when I did say it , that it was a positive and  | final judgment , that they could rely on it , and that they need in , vestigate no further . And so I said I wanted more time . They told me to keep on , and to try to bring some real evidence , either way . Surely that need not take me much longer . What could I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind all that I knew about Nina 's life , but it was scant . Only from her could I get details that would serve as final proof to them . I could not see her childhood , her girlhood , in focus , and it had become dreadfully important for me to know , for myself . Either way . Then I decided that there was only one thing for me to do . I had to tell her . And it became fixed in my mind that I had to tell her first the truth about myself . Could I not simply have said , " Nina , the Gestapo suspects you of being Jewish " ? I could have given her that warning without exposing myself , and without burdening her with the knowledge of who I was . Yet it did n't come to me that way . Perhaps it was again that terrible need in me , as with Slavek , to have a dear one know me as myself . Perhaps this need was even greater because I was estranged from Slavek . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . I had for so long been successfully hidden  --  almost two years ; it was as though something deep within me were insisting that things could not be this way , that I could not remain hidden forever , even experiencing some enjoyment in life , while every Jew was dying . And perhaps also there was the feeling that if I revealed myself to her , and she then revealed herself to me , if it did turn out that she was Jewish , I would have , with Nina , an intimacy even deeper than before . Not only would she know me , but we would know each other , know each other with a doubly secret intimacy in which life itself was kept sealed , and this would forever stop my inner loneliness .  | But the reason I gave myself for telling her who I was , was simply that I had to gain her complete confidence . I had to bring everything to light in order that we might deal with her situation together . Otherwise the Gestapo might set someone else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , with even Clava out of the way . I decided on a Sunday morning . We slept late . Clava , who had a date for an outing with Hans the Czech , arose and went to the mess hall to fetch breakfast for us all . There had been half a plan for Nina and myself to go along on the outing . But now I said , " Nina , I have something to talk to you about . Let 's the two of us stay home . " " All right , Katinka , " she said . I could see that she felt sure it was something to do with my troubled romance . Clava brought in the breakfast ; we chattered , she dressed . " Up , up , get dressed , or the day will be over ! " We protested that we felt too lazy . She shrugged and finally went off . We were still in our nightgowns , sitting opposite each other on our beds , with the little breakfast table between us . " So , Katinka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not in trouble ? " " No , Nina , " I said . " I 've something important to tell you , but first I have to ask for only one thing  --  that it stay between us , no matter what happens to us . Even if we should sometimes quarrel . " She laughed . We quarreled often enough ; we both had tempers . " Do n't drop that dress on the chair ! You 're always the last one to straighten things up " . . . and so on . " What is it , Katya ? " And as with Slavek , I plunged . " You know , Nina , I 'm Jewish . " She laughed , but in a different tone now . Quite loudly , as at a joke that is n't exactly in good taste . " Is this what we stayed home for  --  for such a stupid joke ? "  | " It 's true . " " Katya , do you think you can make a fool of me with such non-sense ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing one does n't joke . " " Ay , Katya ! If it is n't a joke , then why would you ever tell me such a thing ! " " I want you to know , because we are so close . I want you to know the truth about me . " She looked into my eyes . There she sat , so near to me , with her golden hair , her light-blue eyes , her soft Christian face , and we knew each other so well , and what did we know of each other ? Nina threw back her head and laughed again , more loudly . But this time I caught an artificial note in her laughter . " Nina , believe me , " I pleaded . " Believe me , because it is as important as life itself . " " You 're quite an actress , Katya , " she said . And she laughed again . But it was difficult for Nina to keep up anything artificial . Her laughter faltered . I began to tell her my whole story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the village of Werchrata . I come from a town near by ? Hrebenko . And Hrebenko is a Jewish town . My real name is Eva  --  Eva Korngold . I took the papers of a Ukrainian girl in Werchrata who had died . What 's so strange about it ? I tried to save myself . My sister was already taken , and my mother drove me to leave the house , to save myself . " She had ceased laughing , but now she took the attitude of someone indulging in a game . " You want me to believe that you are Jewish ? Katya , do you know how to talk Yiddish ? " " Of course ! " I said . Though in that moment I had a perverse fear  --  my Yiddish had never been very good . For two years I had been trying to forget every word , every intonation , especially as I spoke in a language so close to it as German . Nina put her hand on the table . " What 's this ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But it 's Yiddish too . Yiddish is a lot like German , " I said . " You surely know that . You 're a philologist . " And I ventured , " Did n't you ever hear Yiddish spoken in Russia ? " Without replying , and keeping up her indulgent , amused manner , she pointed to the window . " What 's that ? " " Fenster , " I said , but with a Yiddish intonation . She looked at me quizzically . The examination went on . Chairs , curtains , the bed , our clothing . But if the word was not German it was Polish , or Russian , except for the Yiddish pronunciation . In despair , I recalled an example my father had given us when he was trying to teach us Yiddish . Brate for the German word Brote . Pointing to a bit of bread remaining from our breakfast , I said , " Brate . " Nina raised her brow . " Why , that sounds like early German  --  low German , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she turned to another question . " If you 're Jewish , do you know about their religion ? I 've always wondered what they do in their synagogues . " " Of course I know , " I told her , " though I was n't religious myself . " The main things I remembered , I said , were the holidays . Passover , when we ate matzoth and had a big feast called a seder . And I described it . " It 's in memory of when we were slaves in Egypt . " Her eyes were changing . " Every family performs this ceremony at home , " I said . " The whole family is gathered around the table ? grandparents , cousins , everybody . In our family we used to take turns ; sometimes we had the seder in our house , and sometimes it was at my uncle 's . We would work a whole week to prepare the feast , all the girls with our mothers , and the night before Passover we had to go over the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread left anywhere , only matzoth . Then , for the whole  | week of Passover , we had to use a special set of dishes ; they could n't be touched the rest of the year . And then , in the ceremony , there 's a moment when the youngest child asks the Four Questions . My little brother Yaacov would recite them . Why is this night different ? " I could n't go on . I was weeping . And suddenly a dreadful sob burst from Nina , and she fell on me . Across the little space between the beds , we fell into each other 's arms . " I too ? " she was sobbing ? " Katya , I too , I too , I too . " Then Nina poured out her whole story . She had scarcely thought of herself as Jewish ; among the Soviets there was very little observance of religious holidays , and each year in her family there had been less and less memory of Jewish customs . The Jewish language had scarcely ever been heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was many years since she had seen one . And just as I now told her that I had hardly learned Yiddish myself , at home , since it was considered to be the language of the commoner Jews , so she had heard no more of it as she had grown . Her parents had always spoken Russian , resorting to Yiddish only when there was something very private to discuss , that the children must not understand . She had married a Russian , a non-Jew , and they had had a baby , a little girl named Svetlana . Then her husband had gone off to the war and been killed . And so she had returned to live with her parents , with her baby . But when the Germans had swept through the Russian Ukraine , annihilating Jews wherever they appeared , she had taken Svetlana and fled to another town . With her marriage documents , her Christian name , her golden-haired little girl , she had hoped to live undisturbed . That was when she had first bleached her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virulent anti-Semite  --  oh , yes , there were plenty of them still to be found among the Soviets , too . And in fear of denunciation she had fled  | again , to still another town . Svetlana had been a frail child . The disorder , the flights , the lack of proper food , had weakened the child and she had taken sick with an inflammation of the lungs . And so the baby had died . She had been four years old . Now Nina slipped down on her knees and from under the bed she pulled out her valise ; she put it on the bed and opened it . There , carefully wrapped in tissue paper , were the golden curls of her little girl , which she had clipped off before burial . And there were the child 's little dolls , her toys , her picture books , her little dresses . All this time , in the same room , under the bed next to mine , this life had been lying there  --  this remnant of a life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suitcase . We wept all morning , together . And so I told Nina , then , about the Gestapo , and about my reports during the past few weeks . She could not think where the suspicion might have come from . But one thing was certain : there was no one here who knew her background , and there was no way in which anything could be confirmed , since her city had been recaptured by the Russians . We sat down and worked together on another report in which I could give particulars about her schooling , her childhood , details that would help convince the Gestapo that she was not Jewish . We used all the particulars about her husband 's family . And then we talked of every possibility that might confront us . Suppose , sometime , the Germans became suspicious of me ? " If they should ever arrest me , " I said , " they will certainly bring up these reports I made about you , and charge that I lied . But , Nina , remember what I say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then arrest you , and if they tell you that I confessed that I lied in these reports , do n't believe it ! No matter what they do to me , no matter if they make me confess about myself , I will never tell  | them about you . Even if they show you something on paper and say I wrote it , do n't believe them . " And there did indeed come a time when this warning was useful . But that Sunday , after we had wept ourselves out and shared our lives , a wonderful feeling of peace came over us . We had joined our lives . And later in the day , again and again , we would catch each other , one looking at the other , and each would shake her head and say , " I never would have believed it ! " I made a few more reports to the Gestapo . Each time I went a step further . " Though it is now my definite impression that she is not Jewish , it is still too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally I wrote that I was certain . " We have become more intimate than ever . She has told me her whole life in every detail , just as I have told her my life , and I am certain now that there can be no possibility of any truth in the suspicion lodged against her . " I waited . I was not called again to discuss Nina , nor was she summoned for questioning . They had accepted my final report . We were indeed closer than ever now . Nina had understood at once that Anya too was Jewish . And Nina told me that Karlus knew about herself ; in the end , he knew about all three of us . Clava was not told . But more feverishly than ever now , we studied the little maps that Karlus would draw for us on cigarette paper which he later burned . There were great battles in Russia . The Germans were perhaps back in Kharkov . Would they find out about Nina ? It seemed absurd that they might take so much trouble to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly destroyed .  | Both Karlus and Nina spoke English quite well ; it had been her major study , and he had passed some time in England as a student . Somewhere the Czechs had their secret radio , but it was only rarely that Karlus could tune in on the English broadcasts . But we heard news of the massive Allied air raids , and this we could well believe , for the alerts even in Linz were becoming more frequent . And then things seemed to be going well again . The Allies were winning against Ronuncl in North Africa . The Russians were once more moving forward . Would they even reach Hrebenko ? Once my birthplace was out of German hands , I would be much safer . And so would Anya.  | BUT THEN , that summer , a change came for me . Every change could hold a danger , but there were still other reasons for this change being unwelcome . It happened that the personnel manager of the Hermann Goering works had taken a notion that he needed me on his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , with the records of various foreign employees , dealing with a thousand different questions  --  family allocations , vacation permits , changes of jobs . Sometimes I would receive an urgent call from Herr Lauterman to find him a skilled welder , or someone with other special qualifications . And so it had been established that Katya was an efficient , resourceful worker , and also cheerful , willing  --  a model employee . I had succeeded too well . Herr Lauterman decided that I would be more useful in the Hermann Goering works than in the transit camp , and , being more important than Herr Seifert , he arranged for my transfer . Worst of all , the change meant that I would be separated from Nina and Clava . On the new job , I would have to live on the plant premises . I could not protest . I was promised a room all to myself in the compound as soon as one could be found . In the meantime I was back in an open dormitory with forty other women . At once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a different atmosphere . It was more animalistic , more excited ; there was even something of frenetic sexuality about it . As though the men and  | women , forbidden any other human outlets , any normal home or family life , were driven to sex . On the cot next to mine was a chubby Polish girl who from the first evening gossiped incessantly about every woman in the room , interrupting herself only to ask me directly , Well , and with whom was I going ? Had I ever been with a real German ? It was done , it was done , I need have no fear , and there was a great deal more to be got from a German than from the poor foreign laborers . By the second night she had told me her most intimate secrets : that she had a German lover , one of the guards , that he was from this very town , from Linz , and he had even taken her home to meet his parents , who had been horrible to her , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do because if their affair became known , then not only would she be arrested but he too , for consorting with an Auslanderin . She babbled on , a little bit sly , but mostly foolish , stupid . There was that little Czech girl  --  she pointed out the girl 's bed to me  --  you would only see that one up until bed-check time , or early in the mornings , but it was no use looking for her in bed during the night . " That one is called the whorelet . You can tell by the way every man in the plant talks to her that there is n't a one she has n't been with . Men have a certain way of talking to a girl after they 've been with her , a special smile . When you see a man smile that way to a girl , you know he has been with her . I would n't be like she is ; I am faithful , I can tell you I have n't looked at another man since I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tried , the men here . " And if I wanted , she would introduce me to a friend of her Walter 's . The first , desperate need was to get away from the dormitory . And so , in the office , I kept reminding my boss of his promise that I would have a place of my own . Had he found anything yet ? There were seven or eight of us in the personnel office , and in  | the first days it was as though every cell in my body had become alert , sensing them out , for always in a new place there might be someone troublesome , someone who was too curious about people . Besides the chief , there were two men , and the first , a Slovene named Brata , struck me as overly polite . I had an impression of falsity in him . Besides , the Slovenes were even worse anti-Semites than the Ukrainians . With him , care ! Avoid lengthy conversations . The other man in the office was a German , and a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , openly , laughingly , and unremittingly . A handsome fellow , too , he would sit right down with a girl and kiss her , in front of the whole office . He was always saying , " A man like me , it 's my nature . It 's even my duty . " From the moment of my arrival he was after me . " Ah , a real addition , " he announced . And he jested , " I 'll have to tell my wife about you right away , so she wo n't be suspicious  --  she 'll know ! " There was still something quite shocking to me in the thought of a married man running openly after other girls . Perhaps , I told myself , it was all an office joke . Whenever he bent down beside a girl 's desk to give her some documents , he would put his arm around her . It was difficult to object to this . But after a few days he began pestering me seriously . He would sit down on part of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break away by sheer force , yet laughingly . Already , Max was making remarks about visiting me as soon as I had my own private quarters . That was why , he said , he was doing his utmost to get me a room to myself . The chief , Herr Lauterman , was aloof , strict , a ramrod Nazi . He demanded absolute perfection in our work . If there was a single erasure on a typed page , the page had to be done over ? sometimes five times  --  before he would accept it . But this at least could be dealt with . I never showed him a letter that was not absolutely perfect , I would type it over myself four or five times  | if necessary . Quickly , I was in his good graces : " Katya  --  there is a worker ! " On my second day in the Hermann Goering works , Slavek phoned me . Would I come and have lunch with him ? It had been so long ! More than half a year . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have lunch with me , come over here . " As the plant covered a vast area , there were several restaurants for the workers . Slavek protested that in his shop the hours were strictly kept , and by the time he walked all the way to my side of the plant his bell would be ringing . In such an office as mine , and for a girl , he argued , things were more lenient . But I said no ; I had just got there and did n't want to take liberties . " You come to me . " " Then some other time , " he said , and hung up . I was filled with desire to see him , and yet I could n't act differently . Perhaps I wanted things to be as they might have been at home . If a girl was courted by a bit of a scamp whom she was determined to tame , she could hold herself proud . Yet I missed him incessantly . My face had become thin , and I was uninterested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken with Slavek , Clava and Nina had been arranging dates for me , and a few times I had gone out , together with them . But none of the men had interested me , and lately I had been refusing to go out altogether . Once more , Slavek called . Again we argued about which restaurant . Finally he said , rather angrily , " But , Katya , I simply ca n't come to you ! " I thought of the past when he had found ways to come around , even in the middle of the morning , and I said , " If you want to have  | lunch with me , you 'll find a way to come here . " And I hung up . On so foolish a note , it ended . On my lonely evenings , I would slip back to Bindermichel , and Nina would try to comfort me by singing a Russian love song . Do n't cry , do n't cry , my little Katushinka , Do n't cry , my pretty little love , There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want it , But still we know that when the springtime comes There 'll be dancing again in our street ! So , let 's remember , Katushinka , that springtime has to come ! In the office I was making great progress . So much , in fact , that I even lost some of my dread of the Gestapo . For quite often in my new job I would be called to the downtown headquarters for translations . I could now walk into that building without a sense of doom . The girl receptionist knew me . I would go upstairs to the Foreign Workers Section , to the office of the chief himself , Herr Mueller . He was a man in his fifties , very neat , with the manner of a middle-ranking executive . There was certair'y nothing frightening about him . His private office was good-sized and impressive , with leather chairs , a handsome desk  --  the office of a man of considerable consequence . And almost always , when I arrived , he would lean back as for a moment of relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , here ? " And he would hand me some intercepted letter , referred back to him by the censor . These were always family letters , written by our workers , asking how things were at home . Mostly , they were about food . " Do n't send me  | packages if you deprive yourself . " There was longing in them ; once or twice there were passages from a man to his wife that I did not translate . " Ah , Katya , I see you are blushing . Come , come , what have you left out there ? " And sometimes the men included guarded references to air raids . " There are quite a few clouds overhead , and we have had several hail storms . Last week the hail could be heard all around our barracks . " Such passages I managed to skip , without blushing . Soon I realized that I might be becoming overconfident . I was strolling on the grounds of the plant one afternoon , together with two girls from the office . Behind us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a crude lot , Poles from the Ukrainian area , and we walked on , paying no attention to them . Suddenly one fellow began to yell after me , " That Katya , she 's a Jew ! A Jew ! " I ignored him and walked on , chattering and laughing . But a moment later he started again . " Katya is a Jew ! Just look at her ! Anybody can see it ! Hey , Katya the Jew ! " This time I turned on him . " If you do n't stop these insults , I 'll complain to the Gestapo ! " He stood there , mouth open , his little eyes glinting . " How could I know you 're not ? " he said . " With black hair like that , you look just like the Jewish girls in our town . " " Idiot ! " I snapped , and we walked on . In the next few days whispers came to me . The same fellow was spreading stories all over camp that I was a Jewess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ; he came from nowhere near Hrebenko . But I could not let him go on talking . I had to do something at once , and boldly . The next day I was called to bring some files to the Gestapo . Herr Mueller greeted me laughingly as always . " Well , well , Katinka , my breath of fresh air ! " And when I had turned over the records to him , I said , " Herr Mueller , there 's something personal I 'd like to ask you . "  | Indeed ! He was at my service ! And so I told him I was being annoyed by a Polish lout who had taken to crying " Jew " after me . It was insulting and terribly unpleasant . I asked that he be called in and punished . In a few days I heard that the fellow had indeed been called to the Gestapo and warned not to repeat his insults . After that I did not see him again . But every day now I felt a greater fear . Tiny incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . For quite some time I had felt almost at rest , I had heard nothing at all about Jews . But now , after the investigation of Nina , and with this nasty incident , the whole subject had been reawakened . And soon another incident took place . There was a Ukrainian worker who kept crossing my path as if by chance . Only , he was there more and more often . He was an exceptionally tall fellow with a peculiar smile which he always bestowed upon me . I felt sure that I had seen him somewhere , outside the Hermann Goering works . Perhaps at the movies ? At a cafe ? And then I recalled where . I had passed him more than once in the corridors of the Gestapo building . Our accidental meetings soon happened almost every day . Sometimes more than once a day . He would stop and chat with me now , but it was all in quite a normal manner  --  a young man trying to get close to a girl , and even putting himself in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really nothing more than that ? I took pains to be nice to him , never to avoid him , indeed even to appear where he might expect to find me . Yet I grew more and more uneasy as our little flirtatious conversations developed . Ukrainians could pick up the slightest irregularity in the use of their language . He kept inviting me to his room . Finally , laughingly , I agreed . " All right , if I can bring a girl friend . "  | If it had to be that way , he said , then he would invite a friend for her . And which one would I bring ? The blonde ? Clearly , he was quite familiar with everything about my life ; he knew the girls I went with . No , I said . The little one . And so I asked Clava to come along , telling her it was a date with a fellow I did n't much like but could n't put off . He had a room in one of the barracks , and with him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sight that greeted our eyes  --  it was a spread such as my good employers the Eberhardts could hardly have managed even at Christmas ! A large table was covered with heaped-up platters and unopened bottles . Everything was there  --  vodka , cherry brandy , wine , French brandy , roast goose  --  such a feast would have cost an ordinary worker more than a year 's wages on the black market . I was certain it had been provided by the Gestapo . I wondered if my genial friend , Herr Mueller , had been the one to order this investigation . And so I put on my merriest mood . I drank two glasses of vodka at once , and lolled about as though I were already tipsy ; I sang , I talked freely . They went to work immediately . Casual questions about my home , my family , my schooling . I answered as though my mind was a bit fuzzy from alcohol , but still I made sure to answer everything , to give them a complete story , going back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a girl might , if she were utterly unsuspecting . I had a good model to fellow . Clava had got really drunk , in short order , and as she had no idea what was taking place , she was behaving quite naturally , talking about the war , about her husband , even scolding them when they tried to talk politics . Then they became amorous . A few hugs , a few kisses , had to be permitted . My host 's friend complained about Clava . " Oh , this one  | is no good ; she 's utterly drunk . " And then I said we had to go . My host objected , in dismay . After all this , were n't we going to stay with them ? " But Clava is drunk , " I said , " and I promised her that if she got drunk I 'd see that she got home . " As for myself , I took refuge behind another excuse : I said I was in love . And so we said goodbye , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a defeated effort , while we departed with the virtuous air of girls who had let them take a sporting chance , while promising nothing . Again , I seemed to have passed inspection . And a quiet interval set in . At long last I received my own room . Herr Lauterman kept his promise and secured me a place entirely apart from the dormitory . It was a room where I would be able to close the door and be my own self , without eternally keeping the face of that lusty , cheerful little Ukrainian girl , Katya . Katya all day in the office , Katya all night in the dormitory . The room was not even in a barracks , but in a small , separate building close to the entrance to the compound . The front part of my building was the post office , and behind were two separate little chambers . In one of these lived a woman whom I never saw , her work hours were different from mine . She was an old woman , I was told with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who insisted on being the first to escort me to my " home . " My only contact with this neighbor proved to be late at night , when , if I had visitors , she would knock on the wall for silence . My room was small , but it had a stove , and a real bed , and a table , and a dresser , and for me it represented the greatest of riches . Even more completely than the garret room at the Eberhardts ' , this place was mine alone . I had a home . Even Max 's obnoxious  | suggestions did n't trouble me , now that I was in my own place ; I laughed loudly and managed to get rid of him , reminding him that there were windows on two sides and that if he , a German , were caught with an Auslanderin it would be all up with him . Then , for days , I reveled . I thought of nothing but fixing up my little house . I traded , I begged , I even ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloth , and I managed to get material for curtains . I sewed , I arranged . Nina and Karlus brought gifts , and Karlus put up a shelf , and soon the room was indeed a veritable little house , with colored prints on the walls , one of them even framed , with plates and cups and saucers on the shelf , and a vase with flowers on the table , and a tea kettle humming on the little stove . My room now became the home of our little band , and each of the girls brought household things , as though to see Katya making a bit of a home was as good as making one for herself . When I went out from my little house to work , each morning , I had to walk the entire length of the administration area , and on the way I saw something I had not before encountered . Working on the grounds , eternally rebuilding the walks , was a group of prisoners , but of a strange sort . Their heads were shaven , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later to know all too well . An SS guard stood watch over them . I did n't know what these men were . Somehow I felt they were not ordinary prisoners , and , from the first encounter , I felt an obscure connection with them , a tie . It was then late fall . The whole summer of 1943 had gone by and the second front had not come , and even the Allied attack in Italy , from the little that we could learn , seemed to have been stopped by the Germans . It seemed that this life would be permanent , the only kind of life we would ever know . There were days of cold rain , hail , slush ; there were sharp winds . I was well dressed when I walked to work in the morning , wearing the smart  | zipper boots that Herr Eberhardt had bought me , and a black imitation fur coat that I had bought for myself , with legitimate clothing coupons . It matched the black hat I had made for myself , and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt heartsick and ashamed each time I passed the prisoners in their flimsy cotton pajamas . I would say good morning to them , and they would reply in chorus , and with such pitiful joy , that I knew mine was the only human word spoken to them all day . I would toss them cigarettes as I passed . If I crossed the grounds during the day , they would wave to me from wherever they were . A few mornings , I lingered long enough to exchange a word or two of the most innocent kind  --  about the weather . But one day the SS guard stopped me . " It is forbidden to talk to them . " After that they did n't even dare say good morning  --  only with their eyes . But one time when the SS man was a short distance away engaged in conversation , one of the prisoners , bending over his pickax , kept working parallel to me as I walked along . " You can not know what you mean to us , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was because of the way I was dressed . " Every morning , when we see our little black star in the distance , it 's a sunrise for us . " The air raids were increasing . Sometimes they would come twice a day . And there was a peculiar rule in the plant  --  when the siren sounded , each worker had to carry his tools with him to the shelter . We girls in the office had to carry along our typewriters . The corridors would become jammed with people bumping into one another , blocking one another , each burdened with some clumsy machine . The typewriters were heavy , and to lug them up and down the stairs at every alarm was almost too much for us.  | It was not that we were expected to continue our work in the shelter . On the contrary , a spirit of fun prevailed during the alarms . There would be singing , flirtations  --  men like Max became insupportable . Once , during a long raid , we had quite a party . The alarm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shelter the end of our workday came . The all-clear had not yet sounded . We had sandwiches and tea , and some of the men produced flasks of schnapps . Max kept circling around me and whispering , " It 's already dark outside . After the all-clear , I 'll take you home . " Even Herr Lauterman had unbent . He stood quite close to me , chattering , offering me little compliments , and just then the allclear sounded . " I 'll take you home , " he said . Max was watching us , glowering . Although it was the boss himself who had commandeered me , I was afraid Max would find a way to take revenge . " Someone else was kind enough to offer and is waiting for me , " I said to Herr Lauterman . " Let 's give him the slip , " said my high-ranking Nazi boss . " But I have to take my typewriter upstairs . " " Never mind ! " And before I knew what was happening , he had seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and arrived , puffing , at my desk . Setting down the machine , he seized my hand and pulled me along , making for the door . We had beat all the others . It was pitch dark on the grounds . All at once I felt my boss 's arm around me . We walked on , came to my quarters . He lingered at the door , again began to pay me compliments . " Katya , are you frightened of me ? " " No , please , " I said . I returned to the old excuse . " I 'm in love . " He let me go free . I said , " Good night . " I was frightened of the atmosphere . There seemed to be a kind of contest gathering around Katya , the lively girl with the private room . Who would be coming to her there ? Impossible that there should be no one .  | They circled and circled around me . I even heard again from Slavek . But I would not let myself see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little French prostitute in Linz . I found only one escape , on Sundays . There was an elderly translator , a Bulgarian , and we had become quite friendly , chattering a bit each time we met on the grounds . He was a passionate fisherman , and each Sunday he would bring me part of his catch for my little feasts in my room with my friends . And so one Sunday I went off fishing with Yanko . He brought along some wonderful sausages that he had received in a package from home and a bottle of vodka to keep us warm . And there at the far edge of the factory grounds , where the Danube went by , we sat fishing . I never caught anything , but Yanko always did , and on Sunday nights we would feast until the knocking came on the wall . So it was until the Christmas holidays . As the men  --  Nina 's Karlus and Clava 's Hans the Czech  --  were going home to Prague for the holidays , we girls began to plan a party for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for my twenty-first birthday . The day on which Alla Blumenfeld and I had always held our twinship parties at home . This was to be an intimate party for only Nina , Clava , myself , and Anya , who would come to join us . The letters went back and forth , and everything was arranged for Anya to arrive on New Year 's Eve . I wanted to show her that I too could prepare a real feast ; we used up our ration tickets , the black market was patronized , and Nina , employing all of her resourcefulness , somehow managed to procure the impossible  --  a bottle of champagne ! Anya 's train arrived , and there was no Anya.  | It was a disappointment , but a thousand things could have happened to detain her ; at the last moment , most likely , she had been required to stay at home with the children on the estate . Still , she could have sent a telegram . The three of us had our feast , and it was cheerful enough , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only when there are no men present . We got a little drunk and began talking frankly , and the girls began insisting that it was high time I ceased being an innocent  --  so  --  they were going to teach me to smoke ! As it happened , I had never learned , and with the dreadful time smokers had getting cigarettes , I had been glad that I had never felt the need . But now , yes , I wanted to taste everything , and so I tried to smoke , and choked , and tried again , and choked , and we laughed until I choked more with the laughter than with the cigarette smoke , and my elderly neighbor banged on the wall , but we paid no attention , and finally I smoked an entire cigarette , with tears streaming from my eyes , while Nina said wickedly , " That 's how it will be with everything you have n't yet done , Katinkayou 'll cry the first time , but you 'll like it . " And I laughed until I choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anya would appear the next day . She did n't , nor was there any word from her . I wrote her a long , gay letter about my newest vice . Days passed and there was no reply . Anya , the well ordered , always answered letters at once , and usually no more than three days passed in an exchange of correspondence . I wrote one more time . When the third letter brought no reply , I felt sure there was real trouble . Perhaps she had fallen seriously ill ? Though I had never called her before , I decided to risk a telephone call . It was her mistress who answered the phone . I asked if I might speak with Anya . " Die Anya is not here , " she said .  | " Is she sick ? " I asked . She replied , again in the same stiff way , " Die Anya is not in the house . " Was it known when she would return ? Again , the same stiff formula , and goodbye . Now I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? I hurried to consult Nina . No , she said . Under no circumstances should I put in an appearance , while I had not yet heard from Anya . It was even dangerous to write another letter . I could only wait , in the hope that some sign of life would come . After several days the situation became unendurable to me . Nina and I discussed every possible approach and decided that the least dangerous move would be to make another phone call . This was less tangible than a letter . And so I once more reached the mistress . Could I speak to Anya ? " Anya is not here , " she said , and instantly hung up . There could be no further doubt . Anya had been caught . But how ? Where was she ? I kept seeing her under torture . She was being tortured for me , because she would not give me away . No , no , no ! she kept crying out to them , and each time there came a heavy slap , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they beating her with truncheons ? Despite my visits to the Gestapo , I did not know exactly how they went about their investigations . I had caught only that one glimpse of men standing against a wall  --  and surely that was only the beginning . All the dreadful whispered tales I had of course heard , and now I kept seeing such scenes , mingled perhaps with scenes from movies . A girl with her dress torn away from her breast . Let her tell , let her only tell ! " Tell , Anya . Do n't suffer ! Tell ! " I would implore her , repeating the words out loud , as though they might reach her . Let her tell ! They would in any  | case know ; they would come for me , for had n't we been registered everywhere together , as far back as Przemysl , and then again at Krakow , and in Vienna , and had n't we incessantly visited each other ? And even now , there were letters from me to Anya . My mother seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , Ay , ay , Eva , why did n't you listen , I told you , Eva , you girls must not be together ; you must hardly even write to each other . In the office , I was still the lively , carefree Katya . But how many days were left to me ? And perhaps Anya was no longer alive . Perhaps she had already been shot , or sent off in that way of theirs  --  someone disappeared , and that was all . A death somewhere , in some unknown place , and that left an even darker grief , for you could not even attach a name to it , a place of death , a Belzec , Treblinka , Oswiecim . A death , without even a place of death , was an evaporation , as though the life had never been lived . And then one day there came a sign of life . In the office , it was I who received and sorted the mail , and as I picked up the letters that morning I at once saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses , a wrinkled , smudged letter . I pulled it out . The letter was addressed to Katarina Leszczyszyn ! The name was printed , in pencil , and there was no return address . I opened it . From Anya ! On lined notebook paper , in pencil , she wrote , as though reminiscing romantically , " Here I sit in my little room , with only a ray of light from the high window , and I find myself remembering my childhood days at home , and I think of how we were always together as little girls , since our parents lived next door to each other . ' We were always in the same class at school , and I remember every Sunday when we went to church to Father Piotr . . . " And she went on and on , with many details about Father Piotr , and his little niece Danusia , and I understood . For we had all become expert in writing our letters in a double language . Anya was telling me that she was in prison , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church  --  these were the details she had given her questioners . It was clear that Anya had denied she was Jewish . They had questioned her about me , and she had denied that I was Jewish , telling them these stories about our families . Somehow she had managed to smuggle out this letter , to warn me what I must say , if questioned . I felt stronger , through her . Because Anya was still her resourceful self , and she had not given up . But surely they were now investigating us in the towns we had given as our birthplaces . And as if in deathly perversity , the German retreat had come to an end , their line had solidified again , still short of Hrebenko . So the Gestapo could find out all they needed to know about us . I was certain now that I was doomed . It was only a matter of time , perhaps a few weeks , at most a month . And a spirit of bitter fatality took hold of me . We could squirm , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had us . For two years we had tormented ourselves , dissembled , imagined we could outwit them , that we would live through it all . But they were determined that every Jew would be slaughtered , and so every crack and every cranny would be searched and they would find even such as Anya and myself . Even Nina , too ? When they would question me , they would come again upon the subject of Nina . But I would deny and deny . And unless in spring they made their boasted offensive and drove once more into Russia , there was no way they could prove anything about Nina . And even if they drove ahead , surely her city would have been razed , the records destroyed . As to Nina , they could pull out my fingernails one by one , I would only deny ! And in this mood , awaiting the torture to come , I felt that every experience I tasted , every hour of bitter enjoyment , was triumph  | against them . So if only a short time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know of life . I would wait no more . It should have been Slavek . My whole being kept crying out that it should have been Slavek , and it should have been in other times because I had wanted him so . I had denied that want , because even more than Slavek it should have been the man with whom I would spend my life . With Slavek , I had not been sure . And so I had tried to cling to the belief instilled in me in my childhood , and to wait for my true husband . Oh , Mania , Mamenu , I wanted to cry , I tried , I tried . You see how in spite of everything I tried to remain your good Jewish daughter . But now ? Now I wished that I had taken the moment of passion . For over a year now , Slavek and I had been estranged . I had a new friend . Again it was a friend brought by Karlus , and a Czech . He was older than Slavek , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort for whom every girl would turn her head . Oh , I wanted no more of those . One had come around , after Slavek  --  the beau of the Hermann Goering works , a gymnast . Every girl in the plant was eager to be seen with him , but I had said to myself , Not again . Then Karlus and Nina had come with Hans  --  yes , another Hans . He was tall , wore glasses , proved a good conversationalist and , like Karlus , he was considerate , attentive , warm . After several movie dates and other excursions together I had told myself , Yes , I was fond of Hans , and it was better to have someone to go out with , so I would not be the odd one in our group . He was married , I knew , and sometimes he would complain to me about his wife , how demanding she was , how he had to send her every penny he earned , and I would laugh and tell him , " Do n't complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Now , in my distress , tense with the feeling that I was playing my last cards , I felt more terribly than ever the need of a man close to me . And so , a few times , Hans came without the others ,  | and there were kisses and he would hold me protectively in his arms and know that I was troubled without knowing what troubled me . Hans would not press himself upon me as Slavek had done , and I was thankful for that . I began to tell myself that I was drawn to him . And then Hans would say , not as a man trying to overwhelm a naive girl but as one mature person to another , " Katya , why must we deny ourselves ? " And I was grateful that he could not know how these same thoughts were forever pulling on me , for though I had faith in him , and though he was one of us , he was not like Nina and Karlus to me , and he knew nothing . Things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gestapo came for me . It was not the usual call to come to Mueller 's office , or even to his section . The name of the man I was to see was unknown to me . And yet , as I went there , I somehow did not feel that this was the visit from which I would not return . I gave the name at the reception desk and was sent up to the third floor instead of the second . And there I was admitted to an office far more impressive than Mueller 's . It was larger , and contained a corner window . There was a conference table , a sofa . Five men were in the room ; all of them were in civilian clothes , and I had seen none of them before . The one behind the desk was of medium build , with rather elongated eyes and straight hair parted on the side . Before him lay the inevitable folder . He opened it . " Do you know Esther Warshawsky ? " he asked . I repeated the name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone  --  Could it be someone I 've met in my job ? I 've met thousands of people . " " Do you know Esther Warshawsky ? " he repeated in the same matter-of-fact tone .  | " 1 'm trying to think  --  perhaps if you tell me where I might have known this person ? " I was still afraid to deny outright . " Try to remember , " said one of the men sitting on the sofa . I waited a moment . " I ca n't place the name . " " It 's a friend of yours . " I smiled . " That ca n't be . I certainly know the names of my friends . " The chief drew a snapshot from the folder and handed it to me . " This is Esther Warshawsky . " It was a picture of Anya , with her braids wound around her head , as she was today ; it had surely been taken on the estate , perhaps without her being aware of it . I studied it a moment , then laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There must be some mistake ! Of course I know her . 1 know her very well . But what do you mean , Esther Warshawsky ? Her name is Anya Ozymok . " Still in his dry tone the chief said , " Her real name is Esther Warshawsky . She is a Jewess . " I burst out indignantly , " Oh , that 's a false accusation ! Why , I know Anya from childhood , our families lived next door to each other , we went to the same school , we went to confession together to Father Piotr . I even remember a funny pact we made as little girls : when Anya did n't have enough sins to confess I would trade her some of mine . " And so I wove in all of the details that had been in Anya 's letter , but I tried to mix them in casually , and I added a few things , and changed the order , so that our stories might not seem to have been prepared to jibe . From time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was certainly checking the names and other items that I mentioned against things that Anya had said . How could anyone bring such a horrible accusation against Anya ? 1 kept repeating . It must be some intrigue , there on the farm ; it must have been done by someone who wanted revenge on her . " You know how it is when a girl is alone , and Anya is  | very particular about who she goes with . There were a number of men who were always after her , and she would have nothing to do with them . Just for spite , one of them could have done this . " They listened . Then the chief leaned over , took the photograph from my hand , turned it around and gave it back to me . " Read that . " On the reverse side was the stamp of the police office of Hrebenko . In small , neat handwriting , Anya 's real history was noted . Her name , the names of her parents , even the fact that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was momentarily taken aback . But there was only one thing to do now : brazen it out . " What a horrible mistake ! " I cried . " These stupid provincial police ! How can they be so careless with a person 's life ! But the Polish police are like that . They 're idiots ; they ca n't even read . Who knows from what file they copied this nonsense . " I became more and more indignant . I was outraged ! To risk a person 's life on such flimsy evidence as this ! I even began to shout  --  and I caught myself up . " I know I should n't be shouting , here , and you can arrest me if you want , but when I see things like this happening to someone I 've known all my life ? " I saw that I had impressed them . Now a few of the others began to put in questions , but my questioners were not antagonistic . I sensed that it counted with them that I was the reliable Katya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a serious girl , never mixed up in anything in the slightest way irregular . And I leaned more and more on this . " I give you my word  --  I know Anya as I know myself ! " The chief had not taken his eyes off my face . " Katya , we put a good deal of trust in you . It would be very serious if our trust proved mistaken . " " How can I be wrong about my own life ? " We stared at each other . He pushed a package of cigarettes toward me . I had the impulse to take one , but even though nothing  | might be showing , I felt a trembling inside my body ; I was afraid my fingers might tremble in handling the cigarette . So I said I hardly ever smoked . The photograph was being passed from one to the other ; each turned it over and looked at the writing on the back of it . The chief rubbed his chin and said , " In sum , you insist that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . That is all I can tell you . You will decide , " I said . He nodded , without taking his eyes from me , and then asked me to go out and wait in the corridor . I stood there waiting . Was it now the time to run , to run out of the building in some wild hope of escape ? But if I did , it would mean the certain end of Anya . Presently the door opened and I was called back into the room . There were no smiles , nor did my questioners look menacing . In his matter-of-fact voice the chief announced that they had decided to accept my testimony and to recommend the release of Anya Ozymok . Dazed , I thanked them , trying not to show my impulse to rush away before they could see right through me . They even joked a bit with me . And then I was out of the building . I felt such triumph . I felt capable of anything  --  anything ! I had fooled the Gestapo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved Anya ! I would never be caught ! Oh , these men were not so invincible as all that . Or perhaps there was indeed some good angel watching over me ; perhaps there was a special force planted within me . Every cell in my body was excited , everything in me was pulsing , racing . Now I was out in the open battlefield , and I had won . It was as though I had suddenly been pushed onto another plateau of life . I could not contain my excitement . In the office , everyone saw there was something stirring in me . " What has happened to you , Katya , are you in love ? " I hurried to my room , to hide what was  | written on my face , in my eyes . But I could not remain alone . I walked to Bindermichel . There was even a secret hope in me that somehow , by the same fate that was so good to me , I would encounter Slavek on the way . At last I was with Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracks . She walked back with me to my place while I told her what had happened . Indeed I felt doubly triumphant ; twice I had fooled the Gestapo , once for Nina and now for Anya . But when I had finished the story I was empty . I found myself saying , " I only hope it 's over . That they do n't send a photograph of me to Hrebenko . " " No , no , perhaps they wo n't , " said Nina . And we tried to shut out of our minds what we knew they would do ; we tried to cling to our moment of triumph . We decided to go to a movie to celebrate . Karlus and Hans joined us . We went to the Centralkino and afterward we all came back to my room and I offered my friends wine . Hans , of course , did not know anything of what had happened but he sensed the excitement in me . As he and the others were leaving he whispered that he would be back . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in the same mood of daring . I had never before taken a drink alone , not from abstemiousness but because the impulse simply had not come to me . I told myself that I truly cared for him , that he was a mature man , while Slavek had been only a capricious boy . That he was honest , whereas Slavek with his romantic talk would only have been deceiving us both . That the end of my life was probably near , and that I knew now that things did not happen as one wished them to ; one must seize life as it offered itself .  | Then Hans returned ; he took me at once in his arms , and I went through with it . I would not let myself feel cheated , feel that the happenings of life had forced me to give up even what I had wanted of this . It was strange to have clung so long to an image , even an image of the unknown one , and now to feel that the man was chosen almost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at the moment , when I feared that if I waited longer , I would die without having known what it was to be a woman . He was tender , and even humble , and I succeeded in losing myself in all my senses , reaching for that mysterious ecstasy , that revelation that each girl imagines is to come in the act itself . And he whispered , " You will see ! ' We will still make our life together ! My Katinka , my Katya ... " And the name broke through to me . Who ? Who ? But he did not even know who I was . Slavek , Slavek would have known ; with him I would have been Eva . And even in this moment I had to be false . All this  --  it was Katya to whom it was happening , Katya , a lustful Ukrainian peasant girl . Oh , they were freer than we . And for an instant it seemed to me that my mother knew , and grieved . But so it was , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then I felt only confusion and surprise that it seemed over , that it was nothing more . The next day Nina knew without asking , and I was a naive , stupid girl , curious about the physical details , not even sure the thing had conclusively taken place . Nor , in the weeks that we were together , did I ever know that feeling of complete union that was love . I had taken Hans for the experience ; now , I told myself , I was mature . Then why did n't they come and take me ? I had finished , I had learned what there was to know in life . Day after day I waited , and each day I thought I would cry out , I would break out . What  | had they done with Anya ? They had said they would recommend her release , but there was no word from her , no sign of life . They had only been teasing me , playing with me . They would hold her while they examined my story , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it would be over for both of us . The tension was making me ill , physically ill . Boils erupted under my armpit , on the left side , and they would not heal . Their roots were deep in the flesh , the doctors said , and an operation would be necessary to cut them out . Feeling unclean , dreadfully unclean , and worn out with sleepless nights , and with endless treatments with boiling water and salves , with the changing of suppurating bandages , I went at last to the hospital in Linz where Slavek had once been . And as the time came for the operation , I saw them preparing to put me under gas . Then the greatest panic of all came over me . I would talk ! Under the ether , I would talk ! And in coming awake , too , did n't people always babble ? In my delirium , everything would come out ! I might even talk in Yiddish ! I would give away Anya , if she still had a chance , and I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the doctors , from their preparations . I told them I did n't want to be drugged . I had not known it would be this way ; I had thought that only a local anesthetic would be used . But no , the doctor explained , for this particular operation it would be impossible to completely deaden the pain locally , and in general he preferred to work with the patient under ether . My terror grew . I tried to get out of the operation altogether . I said perhaps some of the salves , the treatments , would still prove sufficient . The surgeon was ready . He was calm , and he took my protest as quite ordinary . Many people , he assured me , were terrified of losing consciousness ; it was a normal reaction . But I need not fear . I would be wide awake in a few hours .  | And firmly the nurse held the cone over my face . I tried to hold in my breath . With all my power I tried to hold onto my consciousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wished for death . I had had enough , enough of this life , and only the worst was before me . Let it all go , I thought ; in the end it will in any case be like this , with gas , in Oswiecim . Perhaps it would be best if it happened to me now . For an instant I wanted to cry . I pitied myself , as if the death were really happening . I thought , not of Slavek , but of that mysterious one , that unmet one who had been destined to be my husband , and who was somewhere in the world . . . . I had betrayed him . No , he was not in the world ; if a Jew had been destined to become my husband he was in this world no longer . And did souls meet , who had never met on earth ? Did they recognize each other , over there on the other side ? Then a tale from childhood came to me , a grandfather 's tale , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of a boy 's soul and a girl 's soul , predestined for each other , wandering and searching for each other in this world and in the after world ... . Waking , would I see the Gestapo faces bending over me ? There was only the nurse . Nothing . Everything as before . Nothing . Then came a good surprise , a letter from Anya ! This time it was in the neat envelope of the Steinkeller estate ; she was home , she said , and was working at her old job . I must come and visit her . Of course the letter had to be guarded ; nevertheless it could  | have had some spirit , some warmth . It was good to know that the Gestapo men had kept their word and finally accepted my testimony , and released Anya , but the whole episode was still dreadfully disquieting . At the end of the week I went to see her , and as the train drew into the little station at Leoben , I recognized Anya standing in the same spot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer the same Anya . Her face was pinched , and everything about her seemed to slump . As we embraced , Anya whispered , " Do n't talk about anything as yet . I feel I am watched . " And so we walked up the mountain , chattering loudly , laughing much , as always before . Could it really be true that we were being watched ? Two girls , on this little road in the countryside , so far from the world with its wars and its politics , who were we , what were we , that the energy of men should be wasted to hunt us down , even here ? In our artificial way with each other , we were like actors carrying on our role in some empty , darkened theater . But at last in her room we were ourselves . Keeping her voice low , Anya told me all that had happened . The trouble had come from one of the farmhands , a Pole from back home . She could not recall ever having seen him there , but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the region of Hrebenko . A dreadful specimen , the worst type , sly , smelly , squat , a drinker . He had kept after her , following her around the farmyard , pestering her , and finally threatening to expose her . " I know you 're Jewish . I know you from Hrebenko . You do n't fool me . " If she would n't yield to him , he would denounce her to the Gestapo . " You 're not like the other girls here . Only Jewish girls hold themselves so high ! " What could she say except , " Go ahead , denounce me , idiot ! " To yield , even if she could imagine herself doing such a thing , would be an admission . For some weeks he had kept repeating his threats , until she had begun to believe he would never actually carry them out . And then one day the Gestapo had come .  | They had taken her to Grumming . She had denied , of course . They had slapped her until she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solitary confinement , they had questioned her again , beat her with their fists , thrown her against the wall . I felt her pain as in my own body . Would I be able to endure it when they did it to me ? Yes , they had questioned her about me . Where had she known me ? Why were we always visiting each other ? And so she had told those stories about our childhood . Finally they had left off their questioning and she had remained in the women 's prison , not knowing her fate . It was an ordinary jail , with thieves , prostitutes , a few politicals , among them a Russian woman who had become her friend . Two months had passed . The Russian woman had completed her sentence , and through her Anya had sent me the letter that warned me what story to tell . But how had she been able to endure it when they beat her ? " As long as they beat me I was sure they still did n't know anything . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force me to sleep with him , and then invented the story that I was Jewish . And you know , Katya , they are afraid of one thing . They do n't want to make a mistake and condemn a real Christian as a Jew . " Yet even worse , I knew , was their worry that they would let a Jew escape as a Christian . They would go to every length to find out whether our stories were true . No , our affair was not yet over . I told Anya of my own interview with the Gestapo , and how I had decided to brazen out the story . " Katya , you have n't changed ! " I could n't tell her how I had changed . It was all so banal , so unworthy , what I had done even while Anya lay in prison in the face of death . And yet I could not keep from talking of the subject itself , as though wanting her to give me sanction . " Anya , if we are really in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | do n't you have the feeling sometimes of wanting to know all t hat there is in life ? " For the first time , tears were in her eyes . " I know , Katya . When I sat there in prison , I thought of it . If there were only someone here I could love . " And then she asked , " Are you seeing Slavek ? " " No , " I said . " I have n't seen him for a year . " She touched my hand . " Perhaps now , if you really love someone , even if he is a Christian ? " too was crying . " No , no , Anya . " And I could n't tell her  --  I was t oo ashamed  --  for it had been done without love . And so the next morning we walked in the springtime fields , trying to appear before everybody 's sight as though nothing had happened . It was only another few weeks before the expected call came for me . One day when I returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoned . I was to come there at two . No further instructions . Only to come to the reception desk . There , I was given a room number . It was not in the Foreign Workers Section , nor was it the third-floor office where I had been before . I mounted the stairs , found the number , and this time with the premonition of finality opened the door . Another ordinary office occupied by two young men . The one behind the desk demanded curtly , " You are Katarina Leszczyszyn ? " " Yes . " My birthplace , age , other particulars . I answered . Abruptly , he snapped , " You are under arrest . You are a Jew , and a spy in the Czech underground apparatus . You wormed your way into the Hermann Goering works in order to obtain military  | information on secret arms processes , which you passed on to the enemy . " Aghast , I cried , " But I 've never even been inside the work-shops ! " The catalogue of my crimes became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they had caught me as a Jew , what was the rest for ? He was shouting now . " For two whole years you have wound us around your little finger ! You completely fooled us about your accomplice , Nina Ilanova . " " No ! No ! " I screamed . " You can shoot me at once , beat me , cripple me , but the truth is the truth ! I am not a spy . I do n't know anything of any Czech underground . I never tried to get into the Hermann Goering works . The manager himself requested me and insisted that I come . Why do n't you ask him  --  Herr Lauterman ! " " You are all spies ! Your accomplice , Nina Ilanova , is a spy and a Jewess , and her lover , Karlus , is a spy ! " Now a deathly dread came over me . With my being a Jew , with my hiding my Jewishness , I had endangered them all . And in catching me for my Jewishness , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to Karlus , and even to Slavek , and to all those brave men who in spite of the power of the Nazis had somehow been carrying on their underground work right here in the munitions center . Whatever it was they were doing , even if they had only a radio and listened to the foreign broadcasts ! But could n't it be more ? Could n't they be sabotaging the manufacture of shells and guns , so that not all the shells exploded , and not all the guns shot straight ? And could n't they be sending out important news over their radio ? Though I really knew nothing of the mysterious Czech underground , all sorts of things of this kind had been whispered about , in a general way . Against such important actions , what did it matter if one more Jewess was caught , even if that Jewess was myself ? If only their  | work against the enemy could be protected ! And if only Nina could be protected ! My luck had already lasted long enough ; it had given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it was at an end . Surely they had their information about me , even a picture of me that had been verified in Hrebenko , just as they had had in Anya 's case . I felt that my death was certain . I just did n't want to drag down any others . " I know nothing of spies ! " I shouted . " And I told you the truth about Nina ! She is no Jew ! " In that instant , an impulse came to Inc . It seemed to me that if I gave myself away , if I admitted the truth about myself even before they produced their proofs , they would then believe what I said about the others . Desperately I cried out , " The only accusation that is not false is that I am Jewish . Yes , I am Jewish . My real name is Eva Korngold . " So it was finished . It seemed to me that the whole time I had known I would be caught , and had really been waiting for this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was this very feeling that undermined me and brought on my capitulation . For it was like a need to comply with doom . And perhaps the Gestapo men even knew of this feeling . They knew the game . They had played it with many others . I had , in a way , played my game with them twice before . I had felt sure that I could brazen things out . I had been able to face them , as long as I was risking myself for others , but when it came to risking others for myself , I was lost . And yet , despite my sense of being doomed , when I cried out my real name there came an opposite feeling in me , of victory and of elation . I had declared myself of my own will , proudly , instead of finding myself whimpering after hours of torture that I was a Jew . I was glad for myself that I had managed to do it this way , before they killed me . But on their side they merely brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of these years of hiding , of pretense ,  | of dread . " You 're still lying ! You 're lying about the Czech underground ; you 're lying about Nina ! " Now my strength came back . " If you want to force me to tell lies , you can ! " I shouted at them . " I am sure that if you beat me enough you will make me lie . But if you want the truth while I am still able to tell it to you , then it 's as I said . I am Jewish . Nina is not . " So you told the truth about Nina ? And about Anya Ozymok ? Esther Warshawsky  --  that was the truth too ? The same kind of truth ? " I was silent . " She 's back under arrest , you know . This time we got it out of her . At least half . " He laughed . " She admitted she 's a Jew , but she claims she 's a converted one , a Christian ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place ! " He roared at me , " Perhaps you have such a pretty story , too ? " " No , " I said . Inside me there was only weeping . How they must have tormented her , what they must have done to her to drive her that far . And yet she had still tried to protect me . She had tried to tell her story in such a way that my own testimony about going to church with her would at least not have been contradicted . " No , " I said to them , " I am not a Christian convert . I am entirely a Jew . " The questioning went on . Who were the members of the Czech underground ? Where did they hold their meetings ? Where was their radio ? I could say only that I knew nothing , nothing , nothing . In turns , they shouted the same questions at me . " You know nothing ! You were with the Czechs all the time ! You go out only with Czechs ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hans . " Why do you keep company only with Czechs ? " I said I happened to like them . They were more cultured than  | the other foreign workers as a rule . They were more civilized . These men were my friends , and that was all . " Just friends ! You went to bed with every one of them ! " Let them begin , let them begin with the physical beating ! Let them strike me , hurl me against the wall , as they had done with A nya . But still this did n't come , and the waiting for it , while they t , luouted and cursed at me , seemed even worse . Now they demanded particulars of my family , my real family . I said so far as I knew they had all been killed in the German death camps . Suddenly both men approached and ordered me to come with them . In the corridor we passed several people who knew me , who had many times chatted , laughed with Katya . There were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averted . It was certainly over for me . Would I first be stood in that long room , face to the wall ? Was it true that the shooting was sometimes done in the basement of this very building ? We were in the Foreign Workers Section . They took me into Herr Mueller 's office . He was standing , waiting . He waited another moment , until they had gone . " Katya , Katya , what have you done ? " he burst out . " Why did you admit anything at all ? " I stared at him , crumbling within myself . I had been so clever ! I had let them trick me into my admission by their wild accusations , their shouting ! All the while , they had n't really known anything for certain . They had shown me no papers , not even a photograph . They had not even known my real name ! And I myself had told them ! Perhaps , even now , Hrebenko was no longer in German hands . If not for myself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If it was n't for that damned filthy Pole ! If not for him , you could have lived here as Katya Keszczyszyn until you were seventy ! Katya , if you had only come  | the other foreign workers as a rule . They were more civilized . These men were my friends , and that was all . " Just friends ! You went to bed with every one of them ! " Let them begin , let them begin with the physical beating !

In the corridor we passed several people who knew me , who had many times chatted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they passed , their eyes averted . It was certainly over for me . Would I first be stood in that long room , face to the wall ? ' Was it true that the shooting was sometimes done in the basement of this very building ? We were in the Foreign Workers Section .

If not for him , you could have lived here as Katya Leszczyszyn until you were seventy ! Katya , if you had only come  | to me and told me , I might have been able to help you . Surely you knew I would help you ! " How could I have been sure ? On this one thing  --  who we were ? how could I know that anyone among them would act humanly ? My voice sounded small . " If that 's so , " I said , " then ca n't it be that you do n't know anything yet ? Let me go out  --  to the washroom . " Vague , wild ideas were in my mind . I was on the second floor . I could let myself down from the washroom window , jump to the courtyard , walk out . " It 's too late , Katya , " he said . " I ca n't do anything now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . Then , at least , if he felt something for me , perhaps he would tell me my fate ? I begged him , " Herr Mueller , can you tell me how it will be ? Will they shoot me , or will they hang me ? " Even so , a faint smile came over his face . " Neither the one nor the other , Katya . " " I know that Jews are killed . " " I 'll send you to a labor camp , " he said . It was as though there were still a remnant in me of Katarina , and this Katarina had the privilege of asking further about the fate of the Jewess , Eva . " Can you tell me where ? " " No , I ca n't . " " If it is for you to decide where I am sent , perhaps I can ask one thing  --  that it not be to Poland . " " Why ? " " Even while I was still at home , I knew that all those sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about that . " " At least then , if it has to be Poland , not to Oswiecim , " I said , for even more than Belzec , that had become the name of horror .  | Something changed in him ; he looked as though he had an impulse to reach out and touch me . " No , no , not there , " he said . And then , coming a step closer , still as though he wanted to touch me but might not , Herr Mueller said , " Do n't despair . You 'll see  --  one day the war will end , as all wars have to end . There will be an exchange of prisoners , as there always is . And then , you may even return home . Only try to remain healthy . Try to keep sanitary  --  that is the main thing in the camps . And let us hope you will come through it all . " That was his farewell , I knew . " Is there anything you want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought here . " Then perhaps they did n't really intend to kill me ? Why would they trouble to move my things ? I attempted to test what Herr Mueller really meant . " I do n't suppose I 'll really need anything . " And I looked up into his eyes , recalling , oddly , at that very moment , Herr Eberhardt 's complaint that I looked too boldly into the eyes of men . How far away that seemed ! Would the Eberhardts hear about their Katya ? Surely all of Linz would know . " Can you imagine ! That Katya was a Jewess the whole time ! " And the Eberhardts would repeat to all their friends , " Why , she lived with us for nearly a year , and we never suspected ! " " At least , take a change of clothing , " Herr Mueller was insisting . Then perhaps I would live , after all , and if I lived , everything that I had lived through had one day to be known . " There is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to have my diary . " He did n't seem surprised . Apparently the diary was already known to them . But I had been careful , and put secret things down in symbols know only to myself . " Yah , yah , Katya , " he said . " We will first have to translate it , and then I will send it to you later . "  | Strangely , I more than half believed him and accepted his words as another sign that I would live . Now the two Gestapo men returned ; they led me to a storeroom where I saw all my things spread out , everything that had been in my room  --  the books , pictures , utensils , my clothing , every single thing of mine , as though I were already effaced from the earth . Some of the clothing had been thrown into the valise that I had used for my visits to Anya , and other things were in the first satchel I had brought from Hrebenko . The rest was in a heap . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear ; my guards stepped into the corridor while I put these on . I put a change of clothing in my valise . I was ready . Entirely silent , the two Gestapo men now took me walking through the town . But for the silence , I might have been out for a stroll with two cavaliers . A short distance from the Gestapo headquarters was the city jail . There they delivered me , and presently I was in a large cell with a dozen other women . And I was so preoccupied with my fate that I hardly noticed the first time a cell key turned on me . The girls in the cell talked volubly enough ; a newcomer was at least an interruption of the monotony . One was a German girl arrested for consorting with a foreign worker . Others were of the sort who are always in and out of prisons , for thieving , for brawling , for black-marketing . An elderly woman whispered to me to be careful of what I said , as there was an informer in the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take me back to Gestapo headquarters . Would it now be the same as it had been for Anya ? They had put her in the jail in Grumming and taken her out for her interrogations and her beatings . Twice , I was taken out . Each time as they led me out of the cell I tried to strengthen myself . Would I be able to endure what Anya had endured , and more ? Even from the way the other  | women looked at me as I was led out , it seemed to me that they were wondering , What will she look like when she returns ? Will she have her teeth ? Will her face be misshapen ? Will she still walk upright , or will she have to be dragged in , unable to walk ? I tried to make my mind blank , to shut out such imaginings . And at the Gestapo headquarters , I waited , from question to question . The same questions . Who were the members of the Czech underground ? Why had I lied about Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was as Jewish as I was . But if they knew , would they still be questioning me ? So I denied and denied . Herr Mueller 's words kept ringing in my ears , " Ach , Katya , why did you admit anything at all ? " And for me the awaited blows never came . Perhaps Mueller , doing what little he could for me , had seen to it that I would be spared the beatings . But as the endless repetition of the questions continued , I found myself again praying  --  if they would only strike me . Strike me , beat me , before I lost my strength ! Then , the third time , they told me to get my things from the matron . Several of the girls said goodbye . The elderly woman said , " Free ? " in a hopeful voice . I shook my head . " Where to ? " I lifted my shoulders . And in that instant , even she seemed to recede behind a wall . For who knew what I might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might still put an end to me . This time my cavaliers walked with a peculiar rigidity . There was an odd thing I had noticed in all their handling of me : I never lost my awareness of their awareness that I was a presentable young woman . I knew that this would not prevent anything that had to happen to me , and yet it gave all of our meetings a peculiar quality , almost as though we were admittedly play-acting , as if at any instant they might say to each other , " This is all nonsense ; let 's take her to a cafe and have some fun . " I felt this even in their excess of rigidity , their show of indifference .  | Could there be any moment in which this could serve me ? Could I make them more uncomfortable ? No , in the end they would shoot me all the same , perhaps with a bit of regret that this equipment for pleasure-giving had to be wasted . We again reached the Gestapo building , but this time we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear corridor ; they opened a door , and I saw a stairway leading downward . In the basement , then , it would be done . I took each breath as though it would be my last . Through my body there was a tense , tingling excitement , an anticipation ; it was like that night when I had waited for Hans to return to my room , knowing that in a certain instant a part of my life would end . Only here I felt an added anxiety  --  as if I were actually afraid that I might miss the instant of my death . If a bullet came from behind , on the stairs , I would n't even have time to feel it , to know my own death . But , no , it was of the Russians that one heard this story ; it was not the method of the Nazis . On the landing , a keeper waited , and my two guards gave me over to him ; they turned , and I heard their tread as they mounted the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and I barely had time to see the outline of a small cell , in the light reflected from the corridor , when he half pushed me inside and turned the lock . Was this blindness ? There was not a sliver of light , even under the door . I put down my valise slowly , as though it might unexpectedly strike the floor , and I stood there hoping that my eyes might become accustomed enough to the dark so that I might make out the walls . The blackness was complete . I put my hand up to my face , felt it , and holding my hand there directly before my eyes , stared and stared , hoping to see somehow the outlines of my spread fingers . Nothing . I remembered Anya . They had n't done this to her . Her cell had contained a tiny high window . I moved about  | cautiously , felt the walls , found a bench , let myself down on it . Was this the finish of me ? Was this my death ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thirsty . I felt my way to the door , called , called . My voice sounded so loud , in the locked room . I beat the door until my fists hurt . Nothing . Suppose they simply left me here until I was dead of starvation ? Why did I keep my eyes open in this blackness ? I lay down , closed my eyes . If I could sleep . But on the edge of sleep , long , long intervals passed ; once I awoke with a start and told myself I had certainly been asleep . Then it must be morning . A whole night must have passed since I was here . Surely it was morning because I felt such a terribly acute need for my coffee , even the worst watery ersatz , some warm token of the new day . My body was telling me morning had come . I tried to call ; I beat again on the door . Nothing . Then I waited , as before . I tried to summon my family , my close ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , the scene in that room where I had first admitted I was Jewish , as though I could pull the whole scene back to me and do it differently ; deny , deny . Then I became merely apathetic . To feel nothing , to lie in apathy , that would be the best way . That way , I could endure the longest . But why , why prolong this dying ? If I could shut off my life now , would I not do it ? And at least cheat them of my final suffering ? For now I was certain they had shut me up in this room to die . And so the time endured in that black cell . I found myself talking to Slavek . Slavek , why had I been so foolish , so contrary ? And I lived again through that night of deflowering , as though it were with Slavek . And then I was in the hospital and I longed for the feeling of going adrift , ending , the anesthetic ending , the quietus for all struggles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clenched hands fall open , and life would escape out of them .  | And then a sharp anger would arise in me . No , no , I would be stronger even than this ! When the allotted time was passed and they opened the door sure to find me dead , I would be alive , alive . I would spring past them with the fierce energy of all that was life ! I would reach the open world . And then out of endlessness I heard a sound . It came down , even piercing the walls of the Gestapo cellar . An air-raid alarm ! There was a double upwelling of joy , of thankfulness in me . The first feeling was one of utterly limitless relief ; I was still connected with life . And welling up within this was the feeling of vengeful glory : they were being killed , they were being smashed , they were scurrying into cellars , none so deep , so safe , as this , and in my dreamlike imaginings there was a force in the raid more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierce down into all the shelters in all Linz , and the entire Hermann Goering works would be destroyed , shattered , and in the end none would creep out alive from the holocaust , only I. I , from this deep cell , would emerge and live . And I would pass through their dead streets and  --  And then , in my imagining , a grief struck me : what if it meant Nina too ? And Slavek ? And Karlus ? Would I still call this vengeance down ? A long time later I heard the all-clear . And then , long afterward , the door opened . The dim corridor bulb was like a blaze of sunlight . The same two Gestapo men stood there . Instantly I noticed that they carried their topcoats folded over their arms . " Come , " they said . I started toward them . " Take your things . " I took my valise , my briefcase . I followed them up the stairs . We returned to the office where they had first questioned me . A tray with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned me to eat .  | I did n't know how many days had passed since I had taken food . But though I was ravenous , I made myself eat decently . I tasted the coffee ; it was the better grade of ersatz . Only one curiosity stood at the front of my mind , and it was not even about what was to come , for me . I wanted desperately to know how many days had passed . It was now morning . " What date is it ? " I asked . " The second of May , " one of them remarked abstractedly , as though he were really not replying to me . But surely that was wrong . It would mean I had been only overnight in that cell . And again it was as though they had robbed me of some vital protection ; I could no longer even judge the length of time . The same one announced , " We are now going on a journey . You will not speak to anyone on the way , nor are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , everything is to appear normal . Do you understand ? But do n't try to get away . " He showed me his revolver . I had scarcely seen him make the movement , but there it was , pointed at me . Both of them held their guns pointed at me for an instant and then put the weapons back into their coats . Momentarily , I had the sense of being in a film , of seeing myself acting on the screen . " Now come with us . " We went out into the street , to all appearances a well-dressed young woman walking between two friends , one of whom was carrying her valise . I was carrying my briefcase , the one I had usually carried when I went to see Herr Mueller at the Gestapo ; now it contained my toilet articles . We went to the railway station and boarded the Vienna train . There were no other passengers in our compartment , and my companions were silent the entire way , except for occasional remarks to each other . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna , if I  | could run into a crowd , into the stream of people walking from the train , then they could n't shoot .. . And why were they taking me to Vienna ? Would Anya also be brought there ? Was it to execute us together ? In the station , one of them stepped down ahead of me , the other close after . They walked pressed against me on either side . How friendly we must seem . And then I heard someone say , " Hello , Katya ! " It was one of the Czechs from Linz . He smiled ; I must have looked quite normal to him , with my two gallants . I said hello to him , and to my surprise he fell in beside us , saying , " Off on a little excursion ? A vacation ? " " Yes , " I said , not knowing what would come next , as I had been forbidden to speak . My guards nudged me and we turned down another platform . " Well , goodbye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last goodbye in the world . And he said , in German , " Auf Wiedersehen. "  | THE PLATFORM was deserted . On one side stood a train , as yet completely empty and without a locomotive . We got into one of the second-class cars . We sat down and waited silently . After almost an hour , other passengers began to mount . And again , none entered our compartment . Was it marked in some way ? How did they know ? Or was it simply chance ? There came a slight bump as the locomotive was attached , and presently the train began to move . What could be its destination ? I felt my body was being carried , not I. My body was being carried to a place of execution . But why ? Why transport it anywhere ? And at such an expense , with these two men occupied to guard me . It soon became clear I was on an express . I sat , smoking . I kept seeing a picture of my execution . I would be marched into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Linz . There would be a firing squad , a small one . I would stand bravely . I would keep my head up . I would even shout out some last words : " Down with Hitler ! " And then I had an obscure feeling : there was something else that I should cry . The Schma . The Schma Yisroael . That was what Jews cried in their last moment of life . How strange that I was so far removed from my religion that this thought should not come easily to me , and that it took an effort of memory to bring back  | the words . Schma Yisroael , Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echod . Would these really be the words of my death cry ? But why , from me ? That which you shouted in your last breath  --  it was the thing you were ready to die for . I recalled tales in my Hebrew class , patriotic legends about the Inquisition , of Jews who in their last breath , after weeks of hideous torture and as they were tied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Selma . But was it that way with me ? No one had tried to force me to accept their faith . The reverse was true . Even those Jews who had tried to accept another faith , to convert , had been beaten back to their own race ; even those who had changed their names , married Christians , deliberately forgotten everything Jewish  --  even they had had the yellow star pinned on them . There would be nothing of final defiance in crying out Schma Yisroael , as in the days of the Inquisition . Yet what else would have meaning ? Could I cry out , Murderers ! beasts ! Could I cry out , You are already defeated ! You can shoot me but your day is near ! Or cry simply , I am a Jew , a Jew , a Jew ! until blood stopped my mouth . I am a Jew , and you will not destroy us ! My people will still live ! When your cities are smashed and Hitler is dead and your Nazi Reich is forgotten ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schma ? But mine was a cry of vengeance , and what was the value of a death cry if it was only a cry of vengeance ? Surely that was not the real meaning of Schma Yisroael , and perhaps I did not even have a right to add a vengeful note to that final cry of affirmation , for what was vengeance in the face of death ? And was there no meaning to anything I had gone through ? I had tried in my last weeks to seize upon whatever life had to offer , but in my haste I had been cheated . There could be no haste , there could be no forcing of life . Perhaps that was the meaning these tormentors could not learn . Only by living could I have come to know the rest , to know the feeling of what life was as I  | lived as a woman and a wife and a mother , with my family growing around me , as my mother had lived . And so as the train wheels turned I felt that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all this horror , and of why the Nazis would not be victorious . For they too were trying to force their will on life itself , to rule life and death , and that could not be . For that was God . And just as when I had been a schoolgirl and had found mathematics utterly incomprehensible , and had tried and tried to concentrate and at one moment had felt I caught a glimmer , that I almost saw how fractions were multiplied , so now I felt , concentrating in my mind , that I almost caught the glimmer , that I almost saw God , and that I understood why a Jew might cry out the Schma . For this was as close as a man or woman could come to understanding the universe . It was to say that life can not be forced , that all life was one , a single flowing movement , and it could not be altered , even by the greatest of human schemes and machinations . That was how we understood that God was One . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would with me . It would not matter so much . The train seemed to be slowing down . We were in the outskirts of a city . Where ? And I suddenly emerged from my reverie and was back as I had been , intent , still feeling the energy of my own will , my own life , feeling the need to take any risk to escape rather than to let myself be carried so to my death . The train slowed ; I arose and said I had to go to the washroom . I walked down the length of the corridor ; I could leap from the washroom window . But one of them followed me , and his foot was in the washroom doorway . Defeated , I returned with him to the compartment . Now the train halted , and two soldiers climbed into our space . They sat opposite us , young , restless , full of spirits . They eyed me , even made audible remarks about the girl . Was she alone ? Was she with those two ?   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
