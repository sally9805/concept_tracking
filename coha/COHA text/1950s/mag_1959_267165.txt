Gibson Jr. , 47 , who had remained unsullied by the fight game 's messier side while supplying the brainpower for Jim Norris ' monopolistic International Boxing Club ( dissolved by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in January ) .

" I was picked up and handled like a murderer , " complained Gibson after his arrest in Chicago . As for Jordan , he was taking the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the champ , he was hanging around with none other than gangland 's celebrated Mickey Cohen .
