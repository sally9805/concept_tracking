txt Howard Hughes sought Government clearance yesterday to manufacture jet airliners incorporating vital " new developments . " These developments , Mr. Hughes contends , will make the planes far superior to Douglas and Boeing jet airliners already ordered in volume by eighteen airlines here and abroad . The move came in the form of an application filed with the Civil Aeronautics Board in Washington yesterday by Trans World Airlines . Mr. Hughes , through his Hughes Tool Company , owns 74.2 per cent of T. W. A. stock . T. W. A. seeks to purchase up to twenty-five of the projected Hughes jets . But first it must obtain revision of the C , A. B. 's 1944 order approving the deal under which the Hughes company obtained the controlling interest in the airline . The T. W. A. application said none of the jet airliners now offered for sale had the range desirable for year-round non-stop Atlantic hops " in both directions under the extreme conditions frequently encountered on that route . " Prevailing west-toeast winds over the North Atlantic frequently reach speeds of sixty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : fuel requirements of westbound planes . New developments of the last two years , the T. W. A. application added , " make it possible to design aircraft at this time that are superior in performance , safety and economy to the commercial aircraft now being constructed . " A spokesman for the Douglas Aircraft Company countered with this statement : " The international airlines who have purchased the DC-8 are thoroughly familiar with the nonstop requirements under all conditions on their routes and are confident that the DC-8 will meet all these requirements with safety and comfort . " There was no indication in the application what specific developments Mr. Hughes was counting on to obtain a superior aircraft . It was considered possible he had in mind some sort of high-life device that would enable his jets to take off with greater fuel loads than their more promise than the flying liveries of the new jets ' wo d begin in , 1961 . The Hughes Co - pany , it was stated , is willing to sell the new planes to any airline at the same price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
