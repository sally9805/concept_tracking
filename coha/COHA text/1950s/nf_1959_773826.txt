txt THE SIMPLICITY OF SCIENCE Each tried and each failed . Then the father separated the bundle and easily broke each stick , one at a time . The moral is obvious ; there is great strength in numbers when united . So it is also with pieces of information . If the observations and results gleaned from many experiments from different laboratories reflecting the efforts , thoughts , and techniques of many different scientists can all be brought together , an interpretation of strength and beauty may result . By such a means a scientific theory or concept is formed . Of course , it is obvious that a theory must be consistent with all the experimental data . Using observations and experimental findings as bricks , we build the structure of a scientific theory . A theory is our best idea as to how a group of separate facts are related to each other . Such concepts do not emerge automatically from observations and experiments , any more than bricks assemble themselves to form a house . Theories , like houses , must be built , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time and area in which he works . After many experiments have been run on different aspects of a particular subject , the accumulated information will enable one or a few scientists to propose a general theory bringing all of that information into one interpretation . A theory is a concept which unifies an area of scientific interest . It provides a single scheme of interpretation for a whole group of apparently disconnected facts . Sometimes a new theory is readily accepted by other scientists as soon as it is proposed . But sometimes a new theory is challenged and a vigorous controversy arises . Battles are waged from the speakers ' rostrums of scientific societies and from the printed pages of books and scientific journals . When such a controversy breaks out , there is a great scramble to run more experiments , testing new ideas and obtaining more evidence in support of one side or the other . Sometimes the issue is decisively settled . Sometimes the issue is not settled , but must be abandoned , pending the development of new methods and new evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous 40 WHAT IS A THEORY ? turbulent controversies which have disturbed its serenity . The birth of a new theory is seldom painless , but if our science is to grow and to have meaning , unifying concepts are essential . There is an incident in the history of biology that is well worth recounting here . It illustrates the sort of controversy that may attend the acceptance of a new and far-reaching theory . It also shows how biologists learned to use and understand the importance of controlled experiments . This incident was a controversy which lasted for about two hundred years . During that extended time , biology as we know it today was being born , and was fighting for its very existence . For the beginning of the story we must travel back in history many centuries to the times of ancient peoples . In antiquity , as in modern times , man tried to form a coherent and meaningful picture of his world . About him he saw a world teeming with living creatures . He also observed that certain animals were to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen emerging from ponds and stagnant water . Salamanders and frogs were to be found in the vicinity of muddy shores . Young turtles were to be observed coming up out of the ground . And so on . Thus , the concept arose that these animals were not only associated with their typical type of surroundings , but were actually created by their environment . Toads were thought to be generated by mud . Maggots were not just living in decaying flesh ; they were produced by it . Mosquitoes were held to be formed spontaneously by stagnant water . All sorts of the lower animals were considered to be created continuously , on the spot , from nonliving stuff ? a spontaneous generation of life . Belief in spontaneous generation of living things was widely held , and became imbedded in the written records of ancient cultures . The ancient Egyptians believed that honeybees were // generated by the carcass of a bull . In a natural history reference book written in Europe about four hundred years ago , there were very detailed directions for producing bees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small house was required . This house must be fifteen feet high and fifteen feet long and fifteen feet broad . There must be only one door and four windows , one in each wall . Into this cube-shaped but , an ox of about two years of age is led , and there beaten to death with clubs by two or three " lusty fellows . " These lusty fellows must beat the ox until it is dead and its bones are broken , but they must not break the skin so that the animal bleeds . Then the nostrils and all other external openings of the ox must be stuffed with soft linen smeared with pitch . Next , some honey is to be poured on the floor around the animal , and the ox is turned " face upward . " The house is then shut up for three weeks , after which time the door and windows are to be opened for a few hours , and then closed again . Eleven days later the house is again opened , and the room will contain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains but the horns , bones , and hair . The rest of the substance of the ox has been transformed into bees . The largest and most handsome of the bees were supposed to have been formed from the brains and marrow . The insects that these ancient people saw around dead bulls , oxen , and others , were most probably no bees at all , but any of a number of flies which , at a superficial glance , resemble bees . This inaccuracy notwithstanding , the scientific name for the honeybee has come down to us as Apis mellif era . Apis is the Greek word for bull . This name for the honeybee was not proposed at the time of ancient Egypt , but during the mideighteenth century in Europe . A procedure for creating mice is also found among the writings from Europe of the Middle Ages . If some rags and a few grains of wheat are put into a crock and sprinkled with a little water , adult mice will appear in a few days . According to some accounts , urine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as efficient as the other . Many such recipes for producing living 42 WHAT IS A THEORY ? things are to be found in the writings of ancient scholars . So well entrenched was the concept of spontaneous generation , that it was believed by virtually all naturalists from the time of Aristotle into the latter half of the seventeenth century . The idea of spontaneous generation was accepted without question , in spite of its drawbacks and inconsistencies . The higher animals and plants were known to reproduce themselves . Seeds of plants were , of course , familiar to all people . Sexual activity and birth processes were likewise familiar . The smaller animal forms , such as snakes , frogs , mice , insects , and so on were thought to be produced by both sexual and spontaneous means . Many plants were also thought to be produced both by seeds and by spontaneous generation . Only the smaller and more obscure forms of life were assigned to the category of the exclusively spontaneously generated . We see well enough , now , that this view is inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on simple observation rather than controlled experiments . It is also a view that is not compatible with the basic ideas of natural unity . We must remember , however , that science in the modern sense did not begin to take shape until the seventeenth century . It is not surprising , therefore , that the whole concept of spontaneous generation was first challenged in that century . Francesco Redi was a biologist who lived and worked in Florence during the seventeenth century . He became interested in the problem of the creation of organisms . He observed that if he killed a large snake and left it outside in an open box , maggots soon appeared and devoured the snake . As the maggots finished feeding and growing , they crawled away from the snake . Redi captured some of these mature maggots and put them in screen cages . After a week or so , they transformed into blowflies . The blowflies so produced were similar in every way to the flies that he had seen buzzing around the snake shortly after it had been killed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big black and white kind and the other a shiny green // species . Both were very commonly seen in Florence and that part of Europe . If it were true that maggots are generated by decaying flesh , then different kinds of meat should produce different kinds of fly maggots . This would seem a logical way to account for the multitude of different kinds of flies that were to be found in nature . Following this line of reasoning , Francesco Redi set out boxes containing the flesh of an amazing assortment of animals . His series included both raw and cooked flesh of oxen , deer , buffalo , lions , tigers , dogs , sheep , goats , rabbits , ducks , geese , hens , swallows , swordfish , tuna , eels , sole , and ? as he put it ? etc . Redi patiently watched what occurred in his boxes , and as the maggots became fully grown , he caged some . His caged maggots transformed into flies . The flies were the same kinds that he had gotten from dead snakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not give rise to different kinds of flies . During the course of his experiments , he made another very valuable observation . He observed that the flies buzzing around the boxes actually deposited eggs on and around the flesh contained in the boxes . This observation made him wonder if these flies were not actually the parents of the maggots which appeared later . Francesco Redi undertook to test the hypothesis that the blowflies produced in decaying flesh were the offspring of blowflies which laid eggs on the flesh . His experiments consisted of placing fresh meat in a number of jars , some of which were left uncovered and some of which were sealed with thin paper . Flies of various descriptions were soon seen around all of the jars . The flies could not reach the meat in those jars covered with paper , and no maggots appeared in them . On the other hand , the flesh in the open containers was readily accessible to the flies , and hundreds of maggots were soon present . Redi 's experiments clearly showed that the dead flesh did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parents of the flies were previous flies . Here was one of the first experiments in biology which was 44 WHAT IS A THEORY ? scientific in the modern sense . The sequence , observations ? ' hypothesis-*controlled experiment  --  interpretation , was fol lowed exactly , and meaningful results were obtained . In his published report on his findings , Redi opened his paper with the following statement : " Although content to be corrected by anyone wiser than myself , if I should make erroneous state ments , I shall express my belief that the Earth , after having brought forth the first plants and animals at the beginning by order of the Supreme and Omnipotent Creator , has never since produced any kinds of plants or animals , either perfect or im perfect ; and everything which we know in past or present times that she has produced , came solely from the true seeds of the plants and animals themselves , which thus , through means of their own , preserve their species . " ' Redi 's conclusions and the clarity of his experimental results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponta neous generation . Others disagreed with Redi 's interpretation and insisted that spontaneous generation was a sound and true doctrine . And the fat was in the fire . Other biologists started running experiments to test the doctrine of spontaneous genera tion . Because the importance and methods of controlled experi ments were not yet generally understood , many conflicting results were reported . Those naturalists using the refinement of controlled observation were able to extend the conclusions of Redi to many other forms of animal life . Thus , between Redi 's publication in 1668 and the middle of the next century , it was shown that gall insects are not generated by plant galls , that toads are not created by mud , that fleas do not arise spontane ously from filth , and so on . By mid-eighteenth century it was fairly well established that living organisms come only from pre-existing organisms , at least in the case of worms , insects , and other visible forms of life . The principle that life comes only from pre-existing life is now known as the principle of biogenesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation were not yet defeated . They retreated from instance to instance as the concept of biogenesis was advanced by adequate experimental methods . The miscroscope had been invented in the seventeenth century . The enthusiastic use of this instrument had opened new biological vistas to the eyes and wondering mind of man . The adherents of spontaneous generation retreated into the new and tremendously important realm of the microscopic . From this haven they held forth , proclaiming that although biogenesis might be true for the larger organisms , it was not true for the very small ones ? molds , yeasts , bacteria , and protozoa . These " special " forms of life were held to be generated spontaneously . The history of science has shown , again and again , that as adherents of a general concept have to retreat to a position of pleading special cases , defeat is imminent . Thus it was with spontaneous generation . It was not yet known that mold and bacterial spores are blown about in the air . Experimental demonstration that these lowly organisms are produced only by others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The spontaneous generation camp further complicated the situation . They asserted that heat sterilization of air , water , and other substances not only kills existing organisms , but also destroys the capacity to produce and support life . This is , of course , a possible interpretation of a sterilizing procedure , even under controlled conditions . Therefore , it had to be shown that the sterilizing effect of heat is to destroy existing life but not the capacity to support living organisms . The complexity of the situation was by no means decreased by the experimental incompetency of some of the men taking part in the controversy . For another century spontaneous generation was to hold out against biogenesis . The work of Theodor Schwann early in the nineteenth century dealt spontaneous generation a heavy blow when he demonstrated that air which had been heat-sterilized could support life . Louis Pasteur administered the coup de grace in 1862 when he was able to show that poor experimental technique was responsible for all of the evidence supporting the doctrine of 46 WHAT IS A THEORY ? spontaneous generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1668 to 1862 ) . The age-old idea that living things can be created spontaneously from nonliving substances lay dying in the dust . Biogenesis had carried the day . But the concept of spontaneous generation lingers on . Many people of today believe that a horse hair will turn into a snake if it is put into water . Such people are a century behind in their education and thinking . Fortunately , none of them are biolo-gists . Biogenesis ? the principle that all life comes only from pre-existing life ? is a cornerstone in modern biology . On it rests our principal concepts in genetics , comparative anatomy , evolution , and taxonomy . So far has scientific opinion swung toward biogenesis , that to speak seriously of spontaneous generation is to commit biologi-cal heresy . Heresy notwithstanding , we must postulate that somewhere and at some time an organism appeared where there was no organism previously . However we may define the word organism , the ghost of spontaneous generation still walks . At the level of our present knowledge , we know that spontaneous gen-eration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factual foundation . There are several points about the biogenesis controversy that are of significance to us in our exploration of science . Once again we saw something of the great importance of the controlled experiment . This point has already been discussed in detail , and there seems little reason for belaboring it . Another point of interest is that scientific advances are products of the times . A new theory can become established only when general advances in knowledge and technical know-how make it possible to test it adequately . The world of science has to be ready for a new concept before a. revolutionary theory can appear and survive . The germ theory of disease could not have had any meaning before the invention of the microscope and the acceptance of biogenesis . Darwin 's theory of evolution by // natural selection would have had little significance had not the idea of evolution been already firmly established in biology . Indeed , the theory probably would not have come into existence at all . Einstein 's theory of relativity would never have been formulated if it were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old physical concepts were no longer completely adequate . Example after example might be mentioned to show that scientific advances are not isolated events , but are the results of previous advances in knowledge and technique . Another item of understanding to be gleaned from the biogenesis story is that no one man established biogenesis . What Redi started in 1668 , Pasteur finished in 1862 . Between start and finish many other workers were also contributing to the ultimate solution of the problem . Scientific advances come from the work of many scientists . Occasionally one man will propose a new concept that is soon adopted . But his new theory will have arisen as an untested hypothesis , and will be tested experimentally by instruments and methods coming , in large part , from the accumulated work of others . If his new theory is adopted , it will be by experimental agreement obtained by many workers over a period of time . His may be a timely flash of genius , but the resulting addition to the body of science will be the result of the labors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not accepted by scientists in general . In scientific literature there are many such short-lived ideas . To be accepted and established , a theory has to bring together into one scheme more facts , or has to account for the well-known facts in a simpler , more logical manner than did any previous idea . Scientists do not meet and pass scientific legislation as to what ideas are to be accepted or rejected . Instead , theories stand or fall on whether or not other scientists use them . Once a new idea is published in a scientific journal , other scientists will test it critically . If the new idea is then used by others as a basis for interpreting further work , it may be said that it has been accepted . If the new idea is not so used , it has been rejected . Thus science grows and advances . 48 WHAT IS A THEORY ? By what right do we say that all life comes from previous life ? To be sure , it is possible to are in existence . How about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat every biological experiment on every specimen in existence . We simply assume that it is quite unnecessary . The principle of biogenesis has been found to hold good for every organism tested , and we have no reason for suspecting that it might not be equally valid for every species and individual which exists on earth . As a matter of fact , biogenesis is so universally accepted that biologists no longer find it a worth-while subject for research . And that brings us to another assumption that is characteristic of science ? the assumption that nature is unified . Without this simple faith in the existence of only one set of natural laws , a single plan for the universe , science as we know it could not exist . The fundamental belief in a unified nature is a very useful assumption . Although I know nothing directly of the nutritional requirements of a gaudy parrot living deep in the jungles of the upper Amazon valley , I would be willing to wager my last dollar that it requires the same vitamins as does the chicken that laid my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kinds of plants and animals differ in their anatomy , behavior , and physiology . But as we learn more and more about them , we find more and more evidence of a thread of unity that is fundamental and runs through all the forms of life . Much more of this will be discussed in later chapters . The influence of the scientist 's belief that all of nature is unified goes far beyond these few examples , however . This assumption gives us the extremely important freedom to apply the knowledge of one branch of science to the problems encountered in another . We assume that what we know of physics and chemistry has applications in biology . In Chapter Two we explored experiments on how bats fly successfully in the dark . In those experiments we made use of knowledge of the physics of sound in order to interpret our biological experiments . When we speak // of the processes by which plants use sunlight to manufacture sugar , starch , cellulose , and a myriad of other substances , we are relying on the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it manufacture sugar in a test tube , we assume that the same chemical reactions were going on in the plant before he ground it up . We assume that not only were those same chemical reactions going on in that particular plant , but also that the same chemical processes are going on in several million other plants , as well . We look on the universe as one big entity , organized and maintained by one set of rules . With this faith , it is considered that what is known in any one branch of natural science is important and influential in all of natural science . The ultimate goal in science is to fit everything , every phenomenon into one over-all concept . The arrogance of the goal notwithstanding , it is the basis for believing that separate events may be closely related in principle . It is on this basis that scientific knowledge can be systematized and organized . The assumption is that if we knew all there is to be known about either an atom or a living cell , we would know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from other kinds of knowledge in respect to this assumption of a unity . A person who is a skilled musician and composer would find his knowledge of little value were he to undertake sculpturing a statue . In contrast , a knowledge of chemistry is valuable to a biologist , for the various branches of natural sciences are closely related . As modern science has developed , from the standpoint of the type of problems investigated and the sort of understanding sought , physics is the most fundamental and the most advanced branch of science . Natural science can be divided , roughly , into three principal branches ? physics , chemistry , and biology . Of the three , physics is the simplest and biology the most complex . That is not to say that physics is necessarily easy to grasp ; indeed , some phases are quite difficult . By simple is meant the directness of experimentation which is possible . 5 0 WHAT IS A THEORY ? Every scientific principle or theory is an expression of how groups of natural happenings are thought to be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of a scientific concept which was adopted only after a long struggle . Two hundred years of controversy were stirred up by the idea that living organisms are created only by similar living organisms . The controversy was caused mainly by the fact that the theory came long before its time . Biology had not advanced in technique and thought to a point where it was ready for a concept of life that was as sweeping and fundamental as biogenesis . It was accepted for the reason that the amount of experimental evidence supporting it grew to be so overwhelming that opposition was finally crushed . Some theories are accepted much more readily and with much less supporting evidence . Theories for which science is ready are quickly accepted . A good example is Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection . The idea of evolution was not new in Darwin 's time . Since the time of Aristotle , numerous naturalists had thought it likely that living things had undergone some kind of gradual and systematic change . By evolution is meant a change or development through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple toward more complex organisms . As man began to study the structure of the earth and the creatures living on it , he found a great deal of evidence that earthly conditions have undergone changes . It became increasingly apparent that the earth as it has been known during man 's sojourn upon it is , in many ways , quite different from what it was millions of years ago . Geologists have tried to read the history of the planet in the composition and arrangement of the layers of rock making up the earth 's crust . They long ago found that much of what is now dry land was once ocean bottom . The remains of tropicaltype plants and animals were found in cold areas , indicating great changes in the earth 's climate . Fossils found in rock strata also have shown quite clearly that plants and animals have differed tremendously during different periods of geologic history . Even without going into detail concerning the fossils found , it // is easily understood that the fact of existence of remains of creatures unlike any known in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the eighteenth century a popular explanation for finding fossils of extinct animals was what is known as the " catastrophic theory . " This idea was that occasionally during the eons of past history , the biological world was completely destroyed by a terrific cataclysm , such as flood , drought , earthquake , or fire . Following such a catastrophe , a whole new set of plants and animals would be created . Thus , instead of any sort of gradual change , or evolution , there was a series of special creations alternating with world-wide catastrophes . The catastrophic theory is not a theory of evolution ; it is a theory which attempts to account for geological facts in a distinctly nonevolutionary way . It does not , however , account for very many facts , and , what is more important , it can not be tested . The only way it could be verified would be for such a catastrophe to occur , with man as a witness and , alas , a victim . The theory contained the seeds of its own destruction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible to arrange these extinct animal forms into series in which the oldest were unlike modern forms and the more recent were increasingly similar to existing species . This sort of evidence indicated gradual ? or evolutionary ? changes . Other evidence from studies of embryonic development and anatomy , also suggested that a gradual biological evolution had been occurring during the earth 's long history . By the early part of the nineteenth century , biology had developed to the point where it was ready to accept and use a theory of evolution . What was needed , however , was an acceptable idea on how such an evolution could have occurred . In 18oq the Chevalier of Lamarck , a French biologist , published a book in which he set forth a theory of how evolution operates . In Lamarck 's theory , evolutionary changes in a species were caused by the habits and physical development acquired by individual animals . This theory is called " evolution by the inheritance of acquired characteristics . " Such a theory gives a 52 WHAT IS A THEORY ? plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the Lamarck theory , the giraffe has evolved an extremely long neck because it has always stretched its neck , trying to eat leaves high in trees . Imagine a giraffe-like animal with a short neck . In feeding on the leaves of trees , it can reach only the lower ones . But after it strips off all the low leaves , it tries to reach the higher ones . This results in constant stretching , so that as the giraffe grows older , its neck actually becomes longer . This longer neck , which has been acquired by muscular effort , is transmitted to the giraffe 's offspring . The little giraffes will start off in life with longer necks because of the use to which their parents had put their necks . Thus , after many generations of continual neck-stretching , the giraffe as we know it was evolved . According to this theory , the children of a race-horse jockey will be better horsemen than they would have been had their father ( same man ) happened to be a bookkeeper . In short , Lamarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical development ) that are acquired by an individual will be passed on to his offspring . Lamarck 's theory became very popular among scientists because the idea that acquired characteristics may be inherited had been around a long time . And Lamarck 's theory was the first coherent " explanation " of evolution . Lamarck had simply taken an already firmly entrenched idea and had applied it to a specific biological problem ? evolution . As will be explained later , Lamarck 's theory no longer finds a place in modern biology . At the time Charles Darwin received his biological training , however , the Lamarck theory of evolution was generally accepted and taught in schools . Darwin was a patient and thorough observer , and over many years he was intrigued by the amount of variation to be found among individuals of the same species of plant or animal . As a young naturalist , he had made good use of an opportunity to travel about the world . As the naturalist aboard the H.M.S. Beagle , he had broadened his biological experience immensely during a five-year cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mals that he studied and observed , he became interested in the small noticeable differences between individual specimens . The differences which impressed him most were trivial differences of the sort that we all see every day and dismiss as unimportant . These are the differences that make one horse win a race and others lose it , and unless we had a bet on the race , such a difference seems of no consequence . Small individual traits mark the difference between winner and loser in livestock expositions , track meets , flower shows , dog shows , and beauty contests . One set of observed facts that was to contribute to Darwin 's theory was that many small individual variations occur in any population of plants or animals . Another idea that influenced Darwin 's thinking came from an essay . In 1798 Thomas Malthus published an article in which he pointed out that human populations tend to increase in numbers until they outgrow their food supply . Malthus used this argument to support the idea that in any well-populated country most of the people will be poorly fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplorable situation was normal and inescapable because , were a more prosperous situation brought about , the population would simply increase until , once again , there would not be enough for all . Conditions of poverty tend to increase death rates and prevent the population from getting too large . Thus , according to Malthus , a human population must reach an equilibrium at a low subsistence level . Of course , we like to think that in our modern society , this Malthusian effect need not come into play as long as our technology continues to advance . Charles Darwin saw that what Malthus said of human populations should also be true of any population of plants or animals . Since the days of Malthus and Darwin , experiments with animal populations have demonstrated the validity of this interpretation . Considering the rate at which even comparatively slowbreeding animals reproduce themselves , it appeared obvious to Darwin that most offspring must fail to survive to maturity . An example of the potential population brought about by even a 54 WHAT IS A THEORY ? modest reproductive rate would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two eggs per year , during a reproductive life of six years . If a person started with a single pair of these birds , he would have a flock of about four thousand birds in twelve years ? two full life spans ? later . Only rarely does a species have an opportunity to display the amazing power of its ability to reproduce . Chance entry into a new territory sometimes results in such a display . The introduction of the jack rabbit into Australia is a classic example , for that small continent soon became literally swarming with jack rabbits . Insect outbreaks are also common examples . Under normal conditions explosive increases do not occur , but the number of a species tends to remain about the same , or to increase or decrease slowly . If only a few can survive , what determines which survive and which fail ? Darwin reasoned that those best fitted for their way of life would have the best chance of making the grade . In a group of essentially similar animals , how can some be better fitted than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little differences that make each organism an individual . Any small characteristic which made its owner a bit more efficient at day-to-day living should give that individual a better than average chance to reach maturity and to beget offspring . The efficient variation might be passed on to the offspring , which would then also have a better than average chance for survival . Thus , the direction of evolution might be determined simply by a constant natural selection of only the individuals best fitted for survival and reproduction . This is the essence of Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection . Darwin 's theory would explain the evolution of the giraffe 's long neck on a basis which is quite different from that by which Lamarck 's theory explained it . As we saw earlier , the Lamarckian idea was that the modern giraffe has a long neck because of the efforts of its ancestors to reach higher and higher . These efforts resulted in longer necks , which were passed on to subsequent generations . Darwin 's theory says that more ancestral giraffes were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // pened to have slightly longer necks than others . In competing with each other for a limited food supply , those with the longer necks were able to reach higher in the trees and feed on leaves unavailable to their short-necked neighbors . Thus they had a better than average chance of surviving and reproducing . Their offspring tended to inherit the longer neck . Of the offspring , those that had even longer necks would have the best chance . Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection provided a powerful unifying principle in that it brought all the evolutionary changes observectin nature into one inclusive scheme . There was no longer a need to look for separate explanations for the evolution of each plant and animal . It brought it all ? plant , animal , and environment ? into one plausible theory . It provided an explanation of how the multitude of different kinds of living creatures could have been created from fewer and simpler forms in nature 's crucible over hundreds of millions of years on ' a constantly changing earth . Earlier we saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental evidence was brought out to support it . Darwin 's natural selection theory of evolution was accepted much more quickly and with practically no experimental evidence . In fact , as first presented , it was more of a hypothesis than a real theory . Though no experiments had been run , the hypothesis was consistent with an amazing array of simple observations . Biology was fully ready for the concept of natural selection by the time it actually appeared . That the time was ripe is shown by the fact that the theory occurred to another Englishman , Alfred Wallace , at about the same time that it did to Charles Darwin . Wallace was in Malaya , which is about as far as one could be from Darwin 's laboratory in England . Wallace and Darwin reached the same conclusions , with neither man knowing of the other 's work . They presented their theory jointly 56 WHAT IS A THEORY ? before a London scientific society , after discovering the identity of their ideas . Because he had compiled more extensive observations and was more active in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit than is Alfred Wallace . One of the major reasons for the acceptance of the natural selection theory in spite of its lack of experimental backing was its close agreement with a great range of observed facts . It was ? and still is ? difficult to look at a mastiff and a lap poodle , breeds of dogs created by man from a single wild species by the simple tool of selective breeding , and doubt that natural selection has been a factor in evolution . By selection , man can shape a great number of plant varieties and animal breeds tailored to his need . How much more could be accomplished by a ceaseless natural selection over millions of years . Since the time of Darwin , the theory has been explored intensively and , of course , tested experimentally . In some of its aspects it has been strengthened ; it has been greatly strengthened by modern genetics . It is now thought that natural selection is by no means the only important mechanism involved in evolution , however . The picture is far more complex than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental evidence is a dangerous practice . Darwin also formulated two other theories , neither of which has survived . Both failed to pass the test of experiments . One was a theory of inheritance . The theory of natural selection requires that there be some means by which favorable characteristics are passed from parent to offspring . In Darwin 's day , nothing was known of genetics , for that branch of biology did not begin its meteoric rise until after 1900 . Darwin 's fanciful scheme of inheritance was blown all apart , once the first developments in modern genetics came about . Darwin 's other theory attempted to explain color patterns and mating behavior in birds , and it , too , failed to pass the test of time and experiment . This theory was called the sexual selection theory , and was based on the idea that females select the males with which they mate . Thus there may be an evolution of sexual // characteristics such as gaudy plumage and bizarre courtship behavior in birds . It might also account for antler size in deer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to the survival of the bird or mammal . They might have the important effect , however , of increasing the opportunity to mate and to transmit the characteristic to a subsequent generation . Evolution in the male might be in part dependent on the whims of the female . Experiments on animal behavior have failed to lend any support to Darwin 's theory of sexual selection . In all of this , what became of Lamarck 's theory of evolution by the inheritance of acquired characteristics ? Lamarck 's theory differed from the natural selection theory in some very important ways . Darwin 's theory went far beyond that of Lamarck . The idea of natural selection accounted for more observed facts . It explained both evolution and the fact that plant and animal populations normally remain about constant in number . The natural selection theory brought both of these observed effects into one coherent picture . The Lamarekian theory was silent on the population problem , and attempted to explain evolution without regard to individual or species survival . Darwin 's theory was also consistent with what animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horses , cows , dogs , sheep , and so on , had been developed by selective breeding ; that is , by mating individual animals showing the desired form or color . Darwin simply said that a comparable selection for fitness goes on constantly in nature . Lamarck 's theory of evolution was not lased on any such similarity to the breeding of domestic animals . Thus , the theory of evolution by natural selection was a broader , more inclusive scheme than the older idea it replaced . There is another very important reason why Lamarck 's theory has been replaced by the Darwinian theory . That reason is one of experimental evidence . Genetics , the most exact of the branches of biology , has steadily confirmed the concept of evolution by natural selection . Studies of plant and animal population dynamics have also supported the theory . Lamarck 's theory has been discarded because there has never been the slightest 58 WHAT IS A THEORY ? shred of experimental evidence to support it . Many attempts have been made to test the idea of inheritance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No theory can long last if it can not be confirmed by experiment , for without experimental support it can not be part of science . In spite of these discrepancies , however , Lamarck 's theory is the " official " genetic theory in communist countries . There it is known as Michurinian genetics , being named in honor of the Russian , Michurin , rather than the Frenchman Lamarck . For a number of years Russian biologists were not allowed to report the results of genetic studies which were inconsistent with the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics . For purely practical reasons , the official attitude has been enforced less vigorously during the last few years . But the genetics of Michurin is still the only communist-sanctioned theory of inheritance . This is simply because the doctrine is more consistent with communist beliefs than is modern genetics . Truth by proclamation . It has been done before . William Harvey demonstrated in 1628 that blood circulates through the body ; this idea was so revolutionary and contrary to firmly held beliefs that the major scientific society of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not circulate . But it went on circulating anyway . There are many theories in science , theories that are meaningful and illuminating . Theories are of great scientific importance because they are attempts to fit many facts into one meaningful picture , like fitting the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle together to form a picture . Theories give us a means of forming workable concepts and an ever-improving understanding of the world in which we live . If a theory stands the test of experiments of many sorts and over a long period of time , it becomes established as a principle or law . Biogenesis is known as a biological law . Natural selection has become a principle . In physics , many laws are known ? conservation of matter and energy , gas law , laws of motion , and so on . Occasionally new findings will completely destroy an old law ; so even our best-established ideas may not be the last words to be said on a subject . 59 IV From Fact to Finish Pilate said to him , " What is truth ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is truth ? " only to wash one 's hands of the whole problem , as was done by a Roman in Jerusalem nearly two thousand years ago . However elusive , truth is always the goal of an honest and inquiring mind . The ideas we hold , the scientific theories we accept , are not in themselves truth , but are man-made approximations of it . A " scientific truth " is not an absolute truth , but only a currently acceptable theory . Indeed , the very term " scientific truth " is not part of a scientist 's working vocabulary . A theory is nothing more nor less than an idea that brings a large number of observations into one scheme . As was stressed in the discussions of experiments and how theories grow , the only " facts " involved in science are observations of things and events . Since we can not work with what we can not observe , we have to assume that what we do observe is hard , incontestable fact . If each such fact were an isolated event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our world would be chaotic and science would be without meaning . So we assume that the things and events observed can , in some way , be related one to another to form an organized pattern . A theory , then , is a description of our very best idea as to how such facts fit together . It would be indeed strange if natural facts were such that only one interpretation could be fitted to them . On what basis do we formulate a theory ? By what reason do we think that a theory has any validity , even though it appears to " agree " with observed facts ? These questions bring us to the subject of the reasoning processes involved in forming a hypothesis , interpreting an experiment , and arriving at a theory . This is a subject of great importance to an understanding of science , and volumes could be , and have been , written on scientific logic and reasoning . Science must.start with observed facts ; the more at hand the better , but some we must have . From these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with all of them . This sort of reasoning is called inductive reasoning . Induction is simply a matter of drawing conclusions from a set of observations . This is the basic reasoning process used in science . In the examples of experiments on the flight of bats and the growth of plants , we arrived at ideas by considering groups of facts . In the formation of the principle of biogenesis and the natural selection theory , reasoning was also inductive . Induction is taking sets of observations as facts and then bringing these facts together into a single picture . Induction is not the only way to reason , however . It is possible to reverse the reasoning process . Reasoning in this reversed sort of way is called deduction . Deductive reasoning involves accepting a general idea to be fact , and then judging individual cases accordingly . A simple example should make clear the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning . Suppose that someone asks , " What kind of blood cells do eagles have ? " The question can be answered in either of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and catch a few eagles . Ex-6a THE SIMPLICITY OF SCIENCE amining some samples of eagle blood under a microscope would provide an answer to the question . Under the microscope we would see the blood cells of an eagle ; these would be undoubted facts . From the type of blood cells we found , we would conclude that we had learned something about the blood of eagles in general . Since catching eagles is a sticky business at best , the easiest way to answer the question would be to try to find something about it in a book . A book about birds will tell us that all birds have nucleated red blood cells . We would then reason that since the eagle is a bird , it too must have nucleated red blood cells . The question would have been answered without our having to go out chasing eagles . This way of answering would be deductive . In this line of reasoning , the general statement " All birds have nucleated red blood cells " is taken as being fact . The particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the medieval centuries there was little inductive reasoning , and most of what was known about nature was by deduction . A story is told about two scholastic monks and a student . Perhaps it is a true story . One cold winter evening the three of them were sitting before a cheerful fire discussing matters academic . At one point in the conversation , the student asked , " How many teeth has a horse ? " Neither of the monks knew offhand . So , they got the works of Aristotle from the shelf and started looking for the answer . The word of Aristotle was considered unquestionable in those dark days . For two hours they searched , but they found no clue concerning the dental furniture of horses . Finally the student naively suggested that they all go to a neighboring barnyard and look into a horse 's mouth . This so shocked the sensibilities of the two monks that they threw the poor student out of a window and into the snow . And they turned back to their books . Deductive reasoning has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important role . Mathematics is a purely deductive system ; certain things are assumed to be true , and from // them the rest of the system is deduced . These assumptions are called postulates and are considered self-evident . They form the foundation of the mathematics . Mathematics is not a science , but is a separate body of knowledge in its own right . In conjunction with scientific work and as a language for science , mathematics has proved to be a tremendously useful tool . It must , however , always be used as a deductive tool , and the results of a mathematical analysis of a problem can have no real scientific standing until they are supported by factual observations . The classical geometry of Euclid is a system of mathematics that was built up from a small number of assumed truths , or postulates . One of these postulates is that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line . From a common-sense standpoint , it seems quite certain that the shortest route from one place to another is a straight path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be proved , however , and must be taken as a self-evident truth . Isaac Newton , one of the founders of physics , used this classical geometry as the language for the expression of his famous laws of the physical universe . A number of mathematicians have invented mathematical systems based on postulates differing from those of Euclid . In the middle of the nineteenth century a Georg Riemann devised a complete and logical system which included the unlikely assumption that an arc is the shortest distance between two points . Riemann 's geometry was interesting as sort of a mathematical toy , but it was thought to be useless in science , because its starting postulates were considered untrue . By the end of the nineteenth century , physical science had advanced to a point where the classical physical theories were no longer completely adequate . Physicists were faced with a number of observed facts that could not be accounted for by Newton 's laws . In 1905 Albert Einstein brought forth a solution to the dilemma . Einstein 's solution was his relativity theory . The mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riemann . And so we now think of space itself as being curved . Scientific concepts are obtained inductively , simply by forrn- // ing theories and laws from sets of related observations . But deduction also plays a part in the scientific method , for a hypothesis is very apt to be a deduction which is about to be tested . Then , too , the applications of accepted theories and laws are usually in the form of deductive predictions . Although the situation is quite complex , science is essentially inductive knowledge , by virtue of the requirement that all ideas and deductions be tested experimentally . Observations and experiments may be interpreted in different ways , some simple and some very complex . The conclusions we reach must , of course , be consistent with the facts at hand . They should also be as direct and simple as we can possibly make them . It is never to be supposed that nature is unnecessarily complicated . Whenever there is a choice , we follow the rule that the simplest theory is probably the most nearly correct one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be proved . Perhaps nature is always extremely complicated , but it does not seem likely . As a matter of common sense , why propose an involved , complicated scheme when a simpler one will explain the facts just as well ? To do otherwise would be about as sensible as traveling eastward around the world to reach your neighbor 's house which is next door to the west . The rule of keeping ideas simple is sometimes known as " Occam 's Razor , " after its originator , William of Occam , a fourteenth-century philosopher . It is indeed a razor , for with it we can cut away the trimmings and the unneeded , and keep our scientific ideas precise and objective . But , as we shall later see , this razor can be a dangerous weapon , and unless we are very careful , we may use it to cut our own throats . The classical example of an overly complicated scheme being replaced by a simpler one is that involving the ideas that have been held concerning the solar system . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the universe . The // sun , moon , planets , and stars rotated around the earth . The earth was thought to be flat and more or less like an island . The stars were lights hanging from huge spheres which rotated around the immovable earth . The idea of the earth 's being the center of the universe is natural , since every day we see the sun rise in the east , climb across the sky , and sink in the west . Such an earth-centered universe is also quite consistent with the human sense of selfimportance . The earth-centered idea of the universe became very complicated when attempts were made to calculate and to diagram the orbits of the planets and to predict their positions at any particular time . These difficulties were solved , however , and Ptolerpy , a Greek astronomer of about the second century , devised a scheme describing the orbits of moon , sun , and the known planets around the earth . The moon and the sun were described as traveling in circular orbits . But the planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move in complex orbits . The planetary orbits might best be described as being like a coil spring stretched around the earth . Although the orbit was circular , the planets described a spiral motion around the central path . The calculations involved in formulating and using the Ptolemaic scheme were extremely complex , and the accuracy with which it was used is quite surprising . After the passing of the Dark Ages , the discovery of the New World and the circumnavigation of the earth did much to broaden the horizons of human thought . With acceptance of the fact that the earth is spherical like the planets , the way was paved for a new concept of the universe . In 1543 , Nicolaus Copernicus advanced the idea that the sun is the center of the solar system . The earth was considered to be rotating around the sun , as one of the sun 's planets . The spiral pathways of the planets were replaced with simple circular orbits . The apparent movement of the stars was accounted for in simpler and more direct terms than had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of the solar system was much more elegant and simple than the older concept . Many objections were // raised to the new idea , however . Some of the objections came from the quarters of organized religion , in that the new idea of the earth traveling around the sun was held to be contrary to Holy Scripture . Other objections involved such questions as " If the earth is spinning , why are we not flung off ? " These controversies need not be detailed here , because we are concerned with the structure of science , not its history . But they tell us an important story , for here was an idea that was contrary to accepted belief and common sense . In everyone 's experience the sun goes around the earth , as do the stars and the moon . And it seems only common sense to think that the earth is both flat and standing still , for if it were moving , there should be a feeling of motion . Astronomers adopted the idea of a sun-centered solar system because it simplified their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical and elegant system than could be made from the earthcentered system of old . So the Copernican concept was eventually adopted , and the Ptolemaic solar system passed out of style . All of this change ? round earth , sun-centered planets ? occurred well over a century before the dawn of modern science . It is probably the oldest example of an idea which was adopted only-on the basis of its being simpler than the theory it replaced . Today , mid-twentieth century , there are people living in the United States who do not believe that the earth is either round or in motion . There is , for instance , a group that maintains that the earth is flat , like a phonograph record , with the north pole in the center . To them , going " around the world " is a voyage in which a circle is described on the flat disk . The edges of the earth are made up of huge mountains of ice known as the antarctic . Such people must find it difficult to account for greatcircle sailing and geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered best because it gives the impression of going directly to the heart of the problem . There is , however , more to the matter of arriving at an acceptable theory than just agreement with observations and simplicity . In the first place , it would be very unusual if a major theory were in agree- // ment with each and every bit of information on the subject . Because of inadequate methods , or incomplete knowledge , ob servations may not always be accurate or properly expressed . Theories are by no means perfect , and may require changes . Or they may even have to be scrapped entirely , as we learn more . The matter of simplicity is , itself , not exactly simple . What constitutes the simplest explanation of a set of scientific results ? The simplest should be the most direct and understandable . To most people , the simplest and most understandable picture of the solar system is the earth-centered idea of antiquity . To the astronomer and the astrophysicist , a sun-centered system is sim pler , because it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the advantage of allowing more efficient deductive use . The sort of simplicity which is desirable in a theory is largely a matter of its usefulness as a working concept , as a tool for further work . It is not a matter of how easily it is visualized or understood in everyday terms . Theories which involve ideas which seem logically necessary from the standpoint of common sense are very appealing . They can , however , be somewhat dangerous from a scientific point of view . A case in point is the " ether theory " which was developed and accepted in the physics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . There was no direct experimental evidence in support of it , but it appeared to be logically necessary . It had to be thrown out ? lock , stock , and barrel ? in the twentieth century . Let us look , briefly , at this ether theory . Some physical forces have the form of waves . Sound , for in-stance , is in the form of waves in the air . The frequency , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured . The wave itself is simply a disturbance that spreads from molecule to molecule . The waves spread out from the source and are car ried by the air . If a noisemaker , such as a bell , is set up in a vacuum , it produces no sound . There is no sound because within // a vacuum there are no air molecules to be disturbed . A wave must have some sort of a medium to carry it . Light also has the properties of waves , and so do electromagnetic forces . But if a light or a magnet is put in a vacuum , it still works . If light and magnetic waves do not require air as a carrier , there must be some other carrier present . Since that carrier is present even in a vacuum , it must be different from ordinary molecules , and might even be a property of space itself . This strange stuff that could not be separated from space was called ether . The concept of ether as the stuff of space was adopted as a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties of light and magnetism . As physics advanced and more and more observations needed explanation , the ether theory became increasingly complicated and unwieldy . All sorts of different physical properties had to be assumed to be characteristic of the tenuous stuff called ether . If all of space is filled with ether , the earth must be moving through it . It should be possible , then , to demonstrate the existence of the ether by measuring its effect on the speed of light . It should have a slowing down or drag effect on beams of light pointed at right angles to the earth 's motion . Very precise and elaborate experiments were carried out to check this point . No such drag effect was found . This was hard to explain . The theory of relativity subsequently showed that the speed of light is not affected by the motion of the earth or any other object . Thus the presence of ether could not be demonstrated , nor could its effects be measured . From a scientific standpoint , this made the ether theory meaningless . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a simplifying idea and a logical necessity had become an encumbering article of excess baggage . In trying to decide what makes one theory acceptable and another unacceptable , a person is forced to make some value judgments . In the first place , it is quite obvious that not all observations are going to be of equal importance to the subject at hand . The scientist is then required to decide which facts are the most pertinent . Such a decision is a value judgment , and is // likely to be a personal opinion , unless the matter can be decided experimentally . Being but a man , a scientist is not able to be completely impartial in his interpretations . As an individual and as a member of a community , he will hold certain philosophical , religious , and political beliefs . A scientific theory which he feels is somehow inconsistent with those beliefs he will oppose . It is very easy for a person to change his ideas on a subject that is not important to him personally . But it is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology have been made . This sort of difficulty was the cause of some of the opposition to Darwin 's theory on evolution . This type of opposition , or even support , has nothing to do with the scientific merits of a theory , but results from the impact of a theory on personal beliefs . Nevertheless , such personal factors play a role in the interpretations we make of any set of observations , however scientific we may try to be . A scientific theory should not close the door to further re-search on a subject . No theory is ever to be considered the last and irrefutable word , and no theory should remove the problem to an untestable realm . One of the oldest problems in biology is the origin of life on earth . A number of ideas have been sug gested , and one theory is that life came to this planet by being transported on a meteor from someplace else . It has been labeled " the germ theory of life " and says that primitive forms of life , such as bacteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their arrival here started the whole process of or ganic evolution . This odd idea actually can not be called a theory since there is no evidence in support of it . It is a hypothesis . It is not only a hypothesis that can not be tested experimentally but also shows the weird characteristic of moving the whole problem to another planet . Since it has been neither testable nor useful , it has found no place in science . The notion that life came to the earth from outer space is not // an impossible idea ? it may have happened . It has not been a scientifically useful hypothesis because no one has been able to test it . With the development of rockets and man-made moons , space travel is certainly within the foreseeable future . This means that it will be possible to determine whether life exists on other planets and whether any bits of living matter are to be found in space . To a limited degree , the " germ theory of life " will become a testable hypothesis . It will be testable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suppose that no life is found drifting about in space . That will not prove that it could not have happened ; it will show only that it would be an uncommon occurrence . Second , suppose that " germs " are occasionally encountered out there in space . Such a finding would not mean that life could not have arisen independently here on earth . So the issue would not be decisively settled either way . The germ theory of life would still be scientifically unsatisfactory , and would have to wait for a bright young space-biologist of the future to devise a better way to test it . Few scientists believe that the earth could possibly be the only life-bearing planet in the whole vast universe . Living things are almost certain to have arisen elsewhere , on other planets in other solar systems . Spaceships and satellites will show that man has finally defeated gravity , that relentless force which keeps our feet on the ground and wears our bodies out . Another of the characteristics of scientific theories is illustrated in the ideas that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of a stone to earth was explained on a basis that would now be considered somewhat idiotic . It was believed that everything seeks its natural resting place assigned to it from the beginning of time . A stone in the air is out of place ; its place is on the earth . The stone , therefore , seeks to return to its proper station in the scheme of things , and it returns to the earth as quickly as possible . Smoke , on the other hand , was assigned a natural position in the sky . Instead of falling to earth , smoke rises , because it , too , seeks its natural resting place . This way of explaining natural occurrences such as objects falling , seems naive to us today . // It is an unscientific idea for two obvious reasons . In the first place , it does not allow for experimentation . How can we run experiments to find out more about " natural resting places " ? It is a dogmatic assertion which closes the door to any extension of knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anthropomorphic . A rock seeks its natural resting place ? How do we know what a rock seeks ? To say that an object seeks a particular condition is the same as saying that it strives toward a goal . From personal experience we have a concept of seeking and striving ; but it is only subjective . That is , experience of seeking and striving comes only from within ourselves . To say anything or any animal seeks or strives is to give it human characteristics . To project our experiences into other objects is anthropomorphism . We must not put our own personalities into other things as observable characteristics , because such thinking involves assumptions that can not be tested . Besides being untestable , anthropomorphism is an unnecessary complication . Thus it violates the rule of keeping our theories as simple as possible . After the work of Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century , the falling of a stone to earth was given a more sophisticated explanation . Formally stated , Newton 's law of universal gravitation is : Every particle of matter in the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the product of their masses and inversely as the square of the distance between them . In short , the bigger two objects are and the closer together they may be , the stronger is the force of the attraction between them . In the example of the stone falling to earth , the earth is a good-sized chunk of stuff , and it will exert a powerful attraction on anything very close to it . Since the earth is so large , it has a great deal of inertia . A small object such as a stone is drawn to it , rather than the earth moving noticeably to the stone . Newton 's law of gravity has proved to be an extremely important and useful concept . The form in which it was stated allows mathematical applications ; these forces , masses , and distances can be measured . The whole idea can be tested by experiment . // Its consequences can be predicted deductively and then tested inductively . As a scientific law it is neat , simple , and useful . It is interesting to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relativity is still more refined in that it does not require the use of the idea of attraction . The relativity theory does not invalidate Newton 's law ; it simply goes far be-yond it . In this discussion of ideas and theories , the terms " agreement " and " consistent " have been used very frequently . " A theory must agree with the facts ; that is , be consistent with them . " What is actually meant by this ? How can we tell whether or not an idea agrees with a group of facts ? This is part of the complex problem of how we think , but the simplest way to look at it is from the standpoint of prediction . Scientifically , an idea agrees with facts if we can use that idea to predict what will occur under par ticular conditions . Suppose that we have a perfect spring scale and some perfect one-ounce weights . The only thing we do not know about this scale is what the numbers on the front mean . Do they read in ounces , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run some experi ments and develop a " theory " as to how the scale is marked . So we start by putting one one-ounce weight on the scale . The pointer moves and comes to rest pointing at the number I. We think immediately that the scale is marked so that it reads in numbers of ounces . If this idea agrees with how the scale is actually marked , we can predict that if a second one-ounce weight is added , the pointer will move to the number 2 . Now we add that second weight , and the pointer moves to 2 . Very good . The results we have obtained tend to confirm or support the theory that the scale is marked in numbers of ounces . When we add the third one-ounce weight , we do so with the expectation that the pointer will indicate 3 . But it does not ; it comes to rest about halfway between 2 and 3 . The idea that the scale is marked in ounces is now in disagreement with the 7 a FROM FACT TO FINISH observations we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the scale will read if more weights are added . Let us add another weight and see what happens . Now the pointer is exactly at 3 . There are four one-ounce weights on the scale , and the pointer is at the number 3 . Obviously the scale is not marked so that it simply counts the number of ounces being weighed . But how is it marked ? We need a new idea , one that will agree with our observations and will also enable us to predict accurately what the pointer will read if we add more weights . Suddenly , an idea comes to mind . Maybe the scale is marked in the terms of a geometric progression such that each number has twice the " ounce value " of the previous number . Then one weight would cause the pointer to indicate i . Two ounces would be twice as much weight , and the pointer would read 2 . Twice times two ounces is four ounces , and with four ounces on the scale , the pointer should come to the number 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of our observations . On the basis of our new " geometric progression theory , " we will predict that if eight one-ounce weights are placed on the scale , the pointer will move to the number 4 . We try it , and that is what happens . Our theory is consistent with the facts observed ? all of them . And it has allowed accurate prediction . It may be a very odd scale , but we can work with it because we have a theoretical understanding of it . In the case of an actual spring scale , or any other apparatus which does not perform according to expectation , we first suspect that the equipment is not in perfect working order . We do not throw a theory away only because a machine does not operate correctly . We must always assume , however , that nature is in perfect working order . When our theories do not fit our observations , theories must be changed . The rule that nature is never wrong , that phenomena occur just as they are supposed to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that nature conform to their narrow ideas . A number of years ago , an aeronautical engineer was curious about how bumblebees fly . A bumblebee has rather small wings // and a large bulky body . This engineer measured the bee 's wings and its body size and weight . He calculated the air resistance , wing surface , and so on . When he was all through with his calculations , he reached the conclusion that the bumblebee is not built correctly for flight . Aerodynamically , it should not be able to get off the ground . Newspapers built the story up with accounts of how " science " had proved that bumblebees can not fly+ But the illiterate little bumblebees went on flying . Any scientific study of how bumblebees fly must start with the observed fact that they do fly . If a set of calculations is not in agreement with that fact , the calculations are in error . The field of aerodynamics has doubtlessly advanced to the point where the flight of bumblebees is now theoretically possible . A scientific theory must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be consistent with all of the pertinent observed facts . These are rigid and relentless requirements . There is no room here for soft thinking and pet philosophies . In the cold objectivity of scientific procedure , some of our most cherished concepts find no place . Any peculiarly human way of looking at life and universe is anthropomorphic ; indeed , that is the very definition of anthropomorphism . Any such concept that can not be measured objectively and made the subject of impartial observation can find no validity in science . Beauty , tragedy , morality , purpose , value , and immortality are but a few of the concepts not included in the scientific scheme . Because they are so important to human thought and living , one might be seriously disturbed by their absence from science . The scientist 's zeal for simple and testable knowledge has led him to trim away the excess fat from the body of science . One may begin to suspect that his enthusiasm for cutting away the fat has resulted in his also hacking off the meat , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeleton , we can start studying the meat . The reduction of knowledge to its simplest and most objective terms is inevitable in the interest of efficiency and usefulness . Take , for instance , the matter of consciousness . Our only // real experience with consciousness is with our own individual personal states of being conscious . In ourselves we think of consciousness as being a state of continual awareness which is in no way dependent on an ability to react overtly . We are perfectly willing to assume that other people are also conscious . This is really only an assumption , for we can not observe consciousness in anyone but ourselves . For me to assume that you experience an awareness which is basically similar to my own consciousness seems to be a safe assumption . Similarly , a person may be willing to assume that some animals are also conscious ? monkeys , dogs , cats , horses . When we assign a state of consciousness to animals we are treading on more dangerous ground . Animal behavior can be observed and can be experimented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , it is easily seen that to assume an animal to be conscious is to go beyond what can be tested , to add an unnecessary assumption , and to inject an element of anthropomorphism into our theories . Besides all of these reasons , there is a practical question of where to draw the line . If we say a dog is conscious , shall we also say that a lobster is conscious , and so on down to a single bacterium ? However real consciousness is to the human individual , it is not a useful concept in science because there are no methods for dealing with it . The same reasons for calling consciousness an unscientific idea can be applied to the other strictly human ideas of beauty , morality , and so on . Some of these ideas will be taken up again in a later chapter . The unsuitability of the concepts from a scientific point of view does not mean that they are meaningless or unimportant . They can not be part of science because they can not be dealt with scientifically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tested and found wanting . Spontaneous generation and the inheritance of acquired characteristics were both theories whose validity was denied by experiment . These ideas could be tested and could be refuted . In science if a concept can not be tested , it can not be refuted , and can not be supported ; it can only be ignored . 75 V A Chain of Events " When you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers , you know something about it ; and when you can not measure it , when you can not express it in numbers , your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind . It may be the beginning of knowledge , but you have scarcely in your thought advanced to the stage of a science . " Lord Kelvin THE s E words of Lord Kelvin , a prominent British scientist of the last century , form a tough-minded and dogmatic statement of what sort of understanding is reached through science . The statement is typical of the attitude of nineteenthcentury physics , and by and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , some doubt has been cast on the neat mechanical world envisioned by the science of that period . What is really meant by the idea that science is only measurement ? Surely anyone can see that there is more to our world than inches , pounds , and other such measurables . The relationship of one thing to another can be more , certainly , than the relation of one set of measurements to another set of measure- // ments . The relationship of a mother to a baby is hardly to be expressed fully in the terms of either measurements or a simple sequence of events . Nevertheless , science is largely limited to such measurements . To understand why this is so , and to understand what is meant by measurement , we must explore the whole idea of what is real . It will be recalled from an earlier chapter that one of the assumptions on which science is based is that nature ? the world in which we live ? is understandable . By studying it diligently and honestly , we will eventually understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so mysterious that it is imponderable and quite beyond human understanding . It was also pointed out in that chapter that one of the ways that we are able to understand the great multitude of phenomena spread before us is to think of one occurrence as being caused by another . This is , of course , the idea of a chain of events , a cause and effect series . In this fifth chapter , we examine these ideas more closely . Philosophers and other people who pause now and then to ponder some of the riddles of the universe have long realized that each person lives in a world of his own . The center of that world is his own mind . The sort of world he lives in is determined by his experience , temperament , and intelligence . This is a subjective world , a private kind of thing . How it corresponds to a real objective universe that is independent of any human mind is a major problem in both philosophy and science . The things and events which occur in the external world act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the mind which receives these sensory signals weaves them into the fabric of a perceived or experienced reality . Since we can not get out of our own minds , our senses provide our only contact with the external world . The world we see , the world in which we each live , has only a subjective or internal reality . We translate this subjective reality into what we think the external world is really like . Things and events certainly exist independently of the human mind . But we can know them only as we can perceive them . In fact , within our experience , their existence is identical to our // perception of them . If a person who has been blind since childhood suddenly has his sight restored by shock or surgery , he is , at first , unable to recognize persons or objects or shapes . What he receives through his newly functional eyes is a chaos of sensory signals . He has to learn to perceive things ; his mind has to learn to form pictures , to shape a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his brain . In a person whose eyes have been normal since birth , this process of learning to form a reality is spread out over many years . Sometimes a small child will announce in a desperate voice that he can not find his pajamas , even though they are lying on the bed before him . The truth of the matter is that he can not find them ; he has not learned to perceive them . His mind , as it were , has not learned to interpret the signals sent in by the eyes so that these signals become identified as a pair of pajamas . A coherent picture of the world around us is formed from sense perceptions coming into our minds from the outside , and also from the apparently nonsensory functioning of the mind itself . The latter we call intuition , or insight . Intuitive knowledge is just as real to us as direct sensory knowledge . But what one person knows intuitively , another person may question , or even flatly deny . They may discuss , persuade , and argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without finding any way to bridge the chasm that lies between their two worlds . When someone says , " Joe and I see eye to eye in this matter , " it means that two individuals have found at least one point where their worlds are in agreement . Different people look at things differently , according to the kind of reality they know ? optimists , cynics , fanatics , and pessimists are but a few of the extremes . What , then , is reality ? In the external universe , the objective world , what is real ? The world of our experience seems very real , but we know that it is a synthetic world that we have formed in our minds from the impressions made by the objective universe . Whatever we perceive we have the individual right to call real , for reality to us must be identical to our perceptions of it . // This discussion may seem abstract and a little confusing . The problem of what is real and what is unreal is an abstract subject . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest philosophers . Their separations of the " real " from the " unreal " have proved to be inconclusive , on the whole . The boundary between objective reality , whatever it may be , and a personal subjective reality is not at all clear . It is not clear , simply because we must deal with an external world from within the confines of an internal , subjective sense of reality . And we have no way to escape . Science is a body of knowledge which represents a prolonged and ever-continuing effort to form a concept of reality which will stand in some sort of consistent working relationship with the external world . Science is objective knowledge , which is to say that , as far as is feasible , it is knowledge of the world which is external to the human mind . This kind of knowledge is an attempt to understand the world of nature both for the sake of knowing what is going on , and to find better ways of controlling and exploiting it .. Of course , scientific knowledge can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the basis of a per ceived reality which is consistent with the unknowable concrete world which is independent of the mind of man . Science is an attempt to formulate an understanding of nature which is not dependent on the individual , but can be held in common by all men . To that extent , it can be objective . Thus , science is less subject to the inconsistencies , vagaries , and incapacities of the individual intellect . It is , of course , limited by whatever short-comings may be inherent in the minds of all human beings . The evolution of scientific theories is an evolution of reality ; it is an evolution of one aspect of societal intelligence . What sort of concept of objective reality is developed in sci ence ? The simplest possible . The attitude is that anything which we can measure , any phenomenon for which cause and effect relationships can be demonstrated , has an objective reality . Any thing , any force , which can not be dealt with by the methods of science has , officially , no objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work we have no reason to assume that there are in the external world real things which we can not detect . There may be many such things , but it is idle ( and dangerous , from a scientific standpoint ) to assume their existence until we are able to perceive them . Either directly or indirectly , they can be perceived only when we can reduce them to some sort of sense perception ? sense data , as it were . Science is full of all sorts of examples of things we now consider very real , which were undreamed of years ago . Seventy years ago , radio waves were first produced in a laboratory . The existence of such electromagnetic waves had been predicted deductively years earlier by the brilliant Scottish physicist , James Clerk Maxwell . Radio waves are very useful to us , as everyone knows , but it was once thought that they were strictly a manmade force . It is now known that large quantities of radio waves reach the earth from outer space . This radio bombardment from space has resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our perceived reality is accordingly more nearly complete . Many other scientific discoveries have widened the horizons of our ideas of objective reality . Infrared , ultraviolet , X rays , vitamins , photons , and a great host of other things have been brought into our experience with the advance of science . If science is to be objective , it must rest on a minimum of per sonal interpretation and be on a basis on which all men can agree . This brings us back to Lord Kelvin 's statement which was quoted at the beginning of the chapter . Precise measure ments on a scale understood by all removes the personality of the observer , and provides a basis for some degree of objectivity . If this is true , science is a restricted kind of knowledge . The restriction arises from the rigid and exacting requirements of the scientific method . The importance , and perhaps the tragedy , of eliminating the individual interpretation may be illustrated by a simple example 8o A CHAIN OF EVENTS from an area of interest lying outside of science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cesar Franck 's D minor symphony . As the majestic strains roll through the room , each member of the group hears a somewhat different piece of music . What is heard in each case is called Franck 's symphony , but what sort of reality the music represents depends on many things . To one who has some appreciation of classical music , listening is a stirring emotional experience . To a musician who has studied Franck 's works in detail , it is a problem in technique and selfexpression , as well as a thing of beauty . To one who does not like classical music , it is nothing more than a complex noise . To him , listening is an obligation , not a privilege . To each member of the group , the symphony has a different beauty , a different meaning , and constitutes a different sort of subjective phenomenon . These differences have nothing to do with the symphony as it was conceived and written by Cesar Franck . The differences have to do with the temperaments , tastes , educations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which all of the listeners can agree on the beauty and meaning of the symphony . These are subjective aspects , and differ widely from one individual to the next . The group of listeners can , however , reach a common understanding of the more objective aspects of the symphony . Setting the concepts of beauty and meaning aside , as having no relevance to the problem at hand , they can reach agreement on the structure of the symphony . They can easily agree on measurements of the number of movements , the number of notes , the sound frequencies , the rhythm patterns , and so on . An agreement can be reached only by making measurements of form and dimensions on a scale of measurement agreed to by all . The symphony as a beautiful musical creation has been replaced by a family of measurements describing the anatomy and mechanics of the music . The measurements have been abstracted from the musical creation , and form an objective concept of the reality of the symphony . But one important thing has been accomplished ; a basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found . This represents an advance in human understanding , provided that we do not lose sight of the original symphony and claim that it is of far less significance than the measurements made . Science is not involved with symphonies , but the analogy can be extended to all things we do study . The scientist , in studying the world of nature , is involved in making measurements of form , history , activities , relationships , and processes . The measurements are quantities which are abstracted from the things and events we study . They are made the basis for a useful and understandable knowledge . To have a knowable , objective reality on which all men can agree , we must reduce thunderstorms , rose petals , rocks , and stars to groups of measurements . The reality of science is a reality of quantitative relationships ; a universe of pointer readings on measuring instruments , as Sir Arthur Eddington , a British physicist , once pointed out . Some things which we normally think of as being qualitative can be measured quantitatively and thus be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , hardness , shape , density , and many others are some of the properties that can be measured just as well as the properties of weight , dimension , and time . Suppose that we have about fifty small glass bottles , each containing a different mixture of a red and a blue dye . We ask a number of people to arrange all the bottles in a row , such that the " reddest " bottle is on the right , the " bluest " bottle is on the far left , and all of the intermediate shades are to be placed in the proper order between these two extremes . There would probably be some disagreement among the persons attempting to arrange the bottles . This lack of complete agreement would be caused by their having slightly different visual acuity and slightly different ideas about the qualities of redness and blueness . By using a light-measuring instrument called a spectrophotometer , a trained technician could arrange the bottles in their proper order , quickly and without error . From the pointer readings on his instrument , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could also calculate the amounts of red 8 a A CHAIN OF EVENTS dye and blue dye in each bottle . He could also inform us of some of the features of the chemical structure of each dye . This technician need not see the colors himself ; he might even be completely color blind . It would make no difference to the measurements , for the qualities of redness and blueness have been replaced by a group of pointer readings on a machine . With these we can deal , quantitatively and mathematically ; with colors we can not . A meteor flashes across the black autumn sky . Its fiery trail hangs for a moment , fades , and is gone . Its brief performance was thrilling to see , but it did nothing that could not be measured and reduced to a cause and effect chain of events . A chunk of matter rushing through space at a speed of thousands of miles per hour was deflected from its course by the gravitational field of the earth . As it entered the upper layers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecular activity in its surface layers . This heating effect increased rapidly until energy was given off as light . As this process continued , the meteor was burned up and its matter dispersed in the atmosphere . By spectrographic analysis of the light produced , the chemical elements contained in the meteor could be identified . From the light path , the approximate size , speed , and course of the meteor could be determined . The brief show of the meteor can be reduced to a cause and effect chain of events . And each one of these events can be measured , and their mathematical relationships can be calculated . We know , too , that if another meteor lurches into our atmosphere , the same sort of a series of events will occur . From a scientific standpoint , we understand the meteor because its behavior has been reduced to a series of measurable and predictable events . Inches , pounds , grams , dynes , ergs , ohms , seconds , and a host of others are the units in which the universe is measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards which have been agreed upon over the years . A dyne in a laboratory in Bombay is exactly the same unit of measure as in a laboratory in Dublin . A dyne is that force which will produce an accelera- // tion of one centimeter per second per second in a one-gram mass . Only through such standards of measurements is science able to remain objective and world-wide . It is obvious that science would become chaotic and extremely limited if each scientist or group of scientists made up separate standards . So great has been the success of science in exploring the mechanisms of the natural world that a monumental body of quantitative knowledge has accumulated since the seventeenth century . The progress since 1900 has been truly fantastic . This great success has resulted largely from the fact that the results of quantitative investigations are easily communicated . A natural phenomenon can be isolated and measured . It can be broken down into its several components , and the relationships of the parts , one to another , can be described mathematically . The results of observations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific journals , the results and the interpretations made can be passed to others . Other scientists can repeat the experiments and elaborate on them , to confirm or deny the original conclusions , and to carry the work still further . Science is knowledge of the mechanisms which operate in the objective external world . We can know the world which is ex-ternal to our minds only indirectly . In this regard , even science is indirect knowledge . Scientific theories and concepts are at-tempts to form workable ideas of the world which will give us understanding of it and power over it . As our science grows and our ideas become more refined , it is likely that our understand-ing of the world becomes more accurate . What we know of the real world must approximate what is really there , as a glove fits a hand . But we must always realize that the glove is not the hand . No matter how well we make the glove fit , it can be no more than an approximation of the shape of the hand . The universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century was a neat and orderly thing . The laws of physics // as created by Isaac Newton had been developed , tested , and ex-tended by the work of many physicists . They were found to be admirably suited to account for nearly all aspects of the material universe . Nothing had been found which would cast any doubt on the infallibility of cause and effect . The universe appeared to be a giant machine , set in motion by an unknown force at some unknown time in the past . The history and future of the universe were unchangeably determined from the beginning . The stuff out of which things are made ? matter ? was also no longer very mysterious . Matter was composed of atoms , and atoms were indivisible hard balls ? the ultimate units of reality . Different chemical elements were made of atoms of different sizes and , therefore , weights . Hydrogen was made up of the very smallest atoms , whereas an element like lead was composed of larger , heavier atoms . Time , space , matter , and energy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uni-verse . There was some little difficulty in fitting the properties of light and electromagnetic forces into the universal concept . It was thought , however , that this difficulty could be taken care of by assuming that the space of the universe was filled with an intangible stuff called ether . Biology was not as well developed as physics , but it was felt that the living organism could also be considered as a machine . The material body of an organism must be constructed out of atoms , the same as everything else . Since this was obviously true , the same concepts of time , space , energy , and matter must be as applicable to the living as to the nonliving . If everything that occurs can be reduced to a measurable series of events , related to each other in a cause and effect way , plants and animals must also be included in that " everything . " Biologists were busily en-gaged in problems of evolution , using the new theory of Charles Darwin . Evolution by natural selection fitted into a mechanical , causally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , nothing much was known about heredity . This igno-rance made it a little difficult to see just how natural selection actually works . An obscure Austrian monk by the name of Gregor Mendel had discovered the basic laws of genetics , and // had published his findings in 1866 . But his results were ignored , and in 1900 they were " rediscovered . " The late nineteenth century was an era of complacency . In technology as well as in science , there was a growing feeling that man had advanced about as far as he needed to , and that the end was in sight , or at least was predictable . A high official in the U. S. Patent Office resigned his position because he thought that there was no future in patents . Everything had been invented and duly patented . Physicists had what they thought was a reasonably complete scientific concept of the universe . Lord Kelvin , an eminent physicist , announced that he could not accept any idea as scientific unless he could either visualize or construct a model of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed and useful details , all of the fundamental scientific knowledge was complete . It was now largely a matter of tidying up the workshop before locking the door . Just before the turn of the century , it was discovered that there are particles which are much smaller than hydrogen atoms . The existence of the tiny particles was shown by passing an electric current through a vacuum in a glass tube . It was shown that the particles were less than a thousandth the size of hydrogen atoms , and that they were electrically charged . They were therefore called electrons . The property of the electron which made it unique in science was that it was found to be nothing but an electric charge . It behaved like matter in the classical sense , in that it had both mass and inertia . But its mass was found to be due entirely to its electric charge . Without the charge , it had no mass , no substance . The electron was found to be a particle of electricity . This was the opening gun of the twentieth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary ? It was the first clue that led to the idea that matter and energy are basically one . Here was a bit of stuff that acted like both matter and energy , and did not fit into the concept of atoms being like hard little marbles . A different way of thinking about both matter and energy was to be grasped . A new approach to old problems be8 // came a possibility . Naturally , the present-day concepts of matter and energy did not spring into being immediately upon the discovery of the electron . Science does not advance so recklessly . The work of many men had to come first , and some challenging frontiers of thought had to be explored and developed . According to an old Chinese proverb , a journey of a hundred miles begins with but a single step . The electron was the first step on a journey that would change the shape of science and remodel the known universe . Quite rightly , the discovery of the electron did not at first greatly change scientific ideas on the construction of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it had to be included in science with a minimum of disturbance to wellestablished ideas . Since it was known that whole atoms carry no electric charge , the negative charge of the electron must , by necessity , be neutralized by a positive charge on the rest of the atom . Sir Ernest Rutherford showed that the atom is composed mostly of space . These advances gave rise to the concept that an atom is like a little solar system , in which negatively charged electrons travel like planets in orbits around a large positively charged nucleus . The structure of the atom could be visualized , and a model could be constructed . Measurements and calculations indicated that there is really very little actual " matter " in an atom . If the space between the atoms and within the atoms contained in a human body could be compressed so that all the particles were touching each other , the unfortunate compressed person would be so small that he would be just barely visible . The solid matter , the hard marbles of the nineteenth century no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solid matter became a little difficult to maintain . Without tracing the development of modern atomic physics , suffice it to say that we now know that the atomic nucleus is also composed of particles which are indistinguishable from quantities of energy . We also know that the human body we suggested be compressed almost to invisibility would , were such compression possible , explode as a bomb . // A mental picture may be formed of an atom as consisting of a nucleus , or central body , with one or more electrons circling around it in orbits . Such a model would seem acceptable enough , even though we must abandon the idea that the larger particles constituting the central nucleus and the smaller electrons are solid matter in the sense that a rock or a crystal is solid to touch and sight . The only trouble with this way of imagining what matter looks like is that it is not good enough . Experiments with electrons , X rays , photons , and other such tiny subatomic specimens , have shown that they behave like waves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pool of water , waves or ripples travel along the surface from where the stone struck . The waves are sort of a disturbance that spreads out and is slowly dissipated . Sound waves are also such disturbances , except that they are carried by air instead of water . Light has long been known to have wave properties . Because we can not think of waves without some sort of a carrier , the question of how light manages to travel through empty space was long a vexing problem . As we have already seen , the idea of ether was used to provide a solution to this problem . We now know , however , that light is in the form of little units or particles , called photons . Photons are particles in about the same sense that electrons are particles , and they travel in a wave-like manner . Electrons also are in constant motion , and travel along a wave-shaped path . And right at this point , we must give up the mental picture we had of electrons moving in orbits like planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particle moving in a wave-like manner ; it acts like a particle and also like a spreading wave . An electron in an atomic orbit can not be located as a discrete particle , and we have to think of it as a sort of wave-like disturbance in an orbit around the atomic nucleus . We must not think of such waves in terms of an ether-like carrier , either . An electron may jump from one orbit to another , an occurrence which is accompanied by the release of a photon when the shift 88 is to an orbit closer to the nucleus . The strangest part of this performance is that the move from one orbit to another appears to happen suddenly , and the electron does not appear to travel through the space between the orbits . In other words , the electron 's shift to a different orbit is instantaneous and does not involve moving a material particle through space . This seems to be the sort of concept required to account for the observed properties of electrons and other subatomic entities of that general ilk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental image of such an atom , and the whole concept is very far removed from that of the nineteenth century . The work with waves , energy , and particles has tended to make us wonder about how understandable nature really is . It is apparent that these things are not understandable to the extent of being easily visualized , and an understanding is attainable only through mathematical expression . From such advanced physical studies , there has come a very disquieting result known as the principle of uncertainty . This principle appears to throw some doubt on the concept of cause and effect . We must be very careful , however , about deciding just how this uncertainty affects our thinking about chains of causally related events . This is an extremely important matter for , as has already been pointed out , science is a body of knowledge based , in part , on the assumption that cause and effect are fundamental characteristics of the universe . So let us make a brief examination of the principle of uncertainty . This principle says in effect that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without in some way disturbing them . Thereby we introduce at least a small amount of uncertainty as to what goes on naturally . At a gross , large-scale level , this disturbance is unimportant , but at the level of atomic particles it becomes of great significance . By refining our techniques of measurement , we can reduce the uncertainty , but we Rn THE SIMPLICITY OF SCIENCE can never eliminate it entirely . There is a degree of uncertainty which can never be avoided . Suppose that we wish to determine the position and velocity of a rifle bullet a fraction of a second after it leaves the muzzle of a gun . This would be a technical problem of no insurmountable difficulty . A high-speed camera and precise timing devices would be required . At a measured time after the gun was fired , a series of pictures could be taken . By knowing the position of the camera and the time interval between successive pictures of the bullet , a good estimation could be made of the bullet 's position and velocity . From these data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it left the muzzle until it fell to the ground could be calculated quite accurately . It certainly would not seem that our observations had in any way disturbed the bullet . Nor would it seem likely that our observations had introduced any degree of uncertainty as to the position , velocity , or trajectory of the bullet . To be sure , we had to shine some light on it in order to take its picture a few times as it streaked past the camera . Considering the infinitesimal size of light particles , compared to the size of the bullet , it is quite safe to assume that bombarding the bullet with light had no measurable effect on the bullet 's behavior . Electrons are different from rifle bullets . If the speed and position of an electron were to be determined in the same sort of way , some insurmountable difficulties would be encountered . An electron , fired from some sort of an electron gun , could be detected only by its striking some other particle . Of course , the same is true of bullets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A photon , a unit of light , is a relatively large particle to slam into an electron . Striking an electron with light would deflect the electron from its original path into an unknown course and would give it a new speed . Collision with a light particle might give us a determination of the position of the electron at one moment only , but it gives us no information on the electron 's speed . Other means may be devised to measure its velocity , but we can not then know its exact position . Since we have no way to measure both speed and position on the same electron // without causing a change in one or the other , we can not predict its position or speed at any time in the future . The most notable thing about this uncertainty is that it is a difficulty which will hamper all future work ; it is not a mere technical quandary that a new technique will solve . Thus there is a permanent degree of uncertainty involved in such attempts to follow the course of natural events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of uncertainty , inescapable with very small particles , can have any effect on the ideas we have concerning cause and effect . Description of a chain of events as a cause and effect series requires that we be able to observe that chain of events continuously from start to finish . This enables us to describe just what is the state of affairs at any given time . In the case of measuring the path of a rifle bullet , continuous observation is at least theoretically possible . The bullet is an event which may be followed without appreciably disturbing its action . In the case of an electron , continuous observation is not possible , because its behavior is changed by the very means we must use to observe it . If we detect a particle at point A at one moment and at point B the next moment , we have no way of knowing whether we have observed one particle or two . And in some ways it is better if we do not even entertain the question of continuity , but simply consider each observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat comparable to watching a baseball game and having no way of knowing whether the ball caught by the shortstop was the same ball that was struck by the batter . Was the ball that the batter hit the same ball that the pitcher threw ? Are there one , two , three , or an infinite number of balls in the game ? And every time we try to observe what is going on , we break up the game . People get thrown out of ball parks for less than that . Since we can not observe the whole sequence , or even two successive events , we can not be certain that there is any continuity , any cause and effect relationship between the actions we glimpse . Just because we can not measure it , are we justified in denying // the existence of cause and effect on an atomic level ? No , it may well be that nature is always in accord with cause and effect , and that nothing happens by chance or without previous cause . The infallibility of cause and effect has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we have reached a point where the concept can not be tested . Any idea that can not be tested must be dropped from science , as it becomes a purely philosophical question . This does not mean that the whole idea of cause and effect is to be dropped . It is still very useful , and it still plays an important role in the observations , hypotheses , ex periments , and conclusions in most branches of science . The breakdown of cause and effect in dealing with the ultimate units of matter-energy serves to show us that there may be other doors to understanding , other worlds not dreamed of in our present scientific schemes . What we observe , what we measure , what we think we know of an objective reality depends in large part on how we go about measuring it , and may be only a poor ap proximation of what really is . At the beginning of this chapter , we set out to determine what sort of a world is described by science . The goal was to draw a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apparent that the whole idea of reality is an elusive , personal sort of thing , and that knowledge even approaching objectivity has to be in the form of measurements of some sort . The most exact and communicable measurements are mathematical . The most meaningful measurement from the standpoint of scientific explanation is a description of cause and effect relationships , ex-pressed in terms and language of mathematics . When it is pos sible to describe a series of events in terms of cause and effect , and when we know enough about the subject so that accurate predictions can be made as to the course of events under dif ferent conditions , we say that we have a scientific understanding of it . // The assumption that everything , every phenomenon , can be accounted for as the effect of measurable causes has turned out to be too naive ; at the level of the ultimate particles of physical reality , we find that we are unable to follow the trail of cause and effect . Another naive assumption that has been part of science is that objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter-energy and the space-time in which they occur . The attitude has been that the objects we see and identify in our day-to-day living must owe their physical properties to the characteristics and behavior of the material particles composing them . This is , of course , a strictly materialistic attitude , but science is knowledge of a physical , material universe . If the expectation is that we should be able to account for our whole world of reality on the basis of the behavior and properties of point-events , such as electrons , we are almost certain to fail . Any object , any event , which may be observed and measured has , from a scientific standpoint , some sort of objective reality . It is one of nature 's facts , and it must be accepted as real . It is , after all , the raw material for scientific research . The sort of knowledge we gain of it , the sort of reality we assign to it , depends largely on how we study it . It depends on what sort of scale we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of photosynthesis , we must work at a molecular and atomic level , because that is the level at which photosynthesis occurs . We are then involved in measuring how plants utilize light energy to combine molecules of carbon dioxide and water to produce sugar . The questions we ask are concerned with transfer of energy , atomic behavior , and molecular synthesis . The scale of observation we use must be one where atoms , molecules , electrons , and action quanta have meaning and reality . But if we study a complex problem , such as animal behavior , it is difficult to determine the scale of observation that will be the most meaningful . For example , suppose we are curious to know how it is that a miller moth will fly into a candle flame . We can study the problem grossly and then in more and more detail by changing our viewpoint , or scale of observation . First , // we can show that such behavior does , in fact , occur , simply by releasing a moth in a room which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fly to the light , and we know that this behavior does occur . It is the real fact which forms the starting point of the investigation . We do not yet know how it occurs , or why it occurs , but we do know that it does occur . Now , we can find out a little more about the behavior by repeating our first observations , except that on different trials we will use lights of different wave lengths ( colors to us ) . We will thus find out what kind of light is most efficient at inducing the behavior . If we should cover the moth 's eyes with a thin layer of opaque paint , we will find that the moth no longer flies toward the light . We now know that the eyes are involved in the behavior we are studying . Thus far we have been working on a rather gross scale . But to follow the chain of events further , we must go to a lower scale of observation , and start experimenting within the moth itself . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes and brain , we can show that nerves and brain are associated with this particular behavior . By similar operations , we can demonstrate that nerve pathways from brain to the big wing muscles are involved . These observations have been on an anatomical scale of measurement . By the use of suitable instruments , we can show that nerve impulses are involved , and that nerve impulses are associated with electrochemical changes in nerve cells . We can also show that the wing muscles are activated by nerve impulses . Muscle action involves contractions , an occurrence requiring energy . Energy to make muscles work is obtained from the metabolism of sugar . The study of a moth flying to a light has resulted in the description of a chain of cause and effect events involving light , eyes , electrochemical impulses of the nervous system , muscle contractions , and energy metabolism . In describing this chain of events , we have used several scales of observation , in which we got progressively farther away from the specific problem we set out to investigate . At each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt real . But their reality seemed less and less directly applicable to the problem of why the moth flies to the light . We do not doubt the prediction that a poison which would inhibit the moth 's energy metabolism would also stop its flying to a light . We can not predict in the other direction , however , for there is nothing in energy metabolism which would enable us to predict that the moth would fly to a light . We have described the behavior as a mechanism , with the moth as the carrier of that mechanism . The mechanism can be studied from many different points of view . But we can not , from the ultimate details of the mechanism itself , predict the original observed behavior . A biologist who is a specialist in behavior might object to this description of the cause and effect sequence involved in the flight of the moth . Behavior , he would say , does not start in muscles . Behavior patterns are controlled from within the nervous system . The characteristics of an animal 's behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Nevertheless , whichever chain of events is followed , we reach a dead end at the energy and subatomic levels , whether in muscles or in nerves . Phenomena such as animal behavior do not take place at an atomic level ; they occur in a much more complex and highly organized state of affairs . In describing behavior as merely one link in a measurable chain of events , we are left with some doubt as to whether some of our measurements have any bearing whatsoever on the problem at hand . We have studied the universe and have found it to be constructed of elusive particles . From the uncertain behavior of these particles we can not reconstruct the reality we know . The real things and chains of events that make up the world appear to be more than just bits of matter-energy ; reality is a highly organized thing . The characteristics of that organized reality depend on how we study it , the tools and methods used . It is no longer sufficient to think only in terms of cause and effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader if our science is to continue to advance in scope and meaning . 95 VI Take a Chance " If we begin with certainties , we shall end in doubts ; but if we begin with doubts , and are patient in them , we shall end in certainties . " Francis Bacon A GROUP of young men have arranged themselves in a circle . Each is kneeling , and each is intent in watching one member of the group . This young man performs a ritual with two small white objects . The men are all dressed in identical blue uniforms . When the performing member casts the white objects to the ground , the others shout and gesticulate and exchange money . If we move closer to the group in order to study this odd behavior , we see that it is a group of sailors . They are engaged in the time-honored but unsanctioned custom of shooting craps . Craps is a gambling game played with a pair of dice . A crap game is not a scientific event ; it is a game of chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considerable scientific importance to the principles of the game . Craps is a game of chance , but the wise player plays the odds in order to leave // the game with more money than he brought into it . In many areas of science we find that there is a large element of chance in natural phenomena . Our scientific research , then , is somewhat like a gambling game , and to leave with more information than we brought into it , we must , like good crap players , learn to play the odds . The individual characteristics of plants , animals , and humans , too , are passed down from generation to generation via hereditary units , which we call genes . The genes of each individual number in the thousands , and each kind comes in pairs . Each of the two parents contributes only one of each of their pairs of genes , so that the offspring likewise has its genes in pairs . It appears to be largely a matter of chance as to which particular genes are given to a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes makes it necessary to incorporate concepts of probability , or chance , into the biological science of genetics . In almost any scientific experiment we do not get precisely the same results every time the experiment is conducted . The experiment being conducted may be a very simple matter of measurement , such as determining the time it takes for an object to fall a given distance . Or the experiment may be more complex , as perhaps in determining the effects of a tranquilizer on the heart and central nervous system of an animal . In either type of experiment , measurements of some kind are made ; and the results are always checked and rechecked by running the experiment several times . Experiments are not perfect , and neither are experimenters . So the measurements made will vary a little bit from time to time , in spite of every attempt to maintain standardized conditions . Some small variations in the results may be due to chance alone . Some variations , however , may be important errors resulting from poor technique , improper controls , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental differences are the result of chance , or whether the differences have real meaning . For this purpose , statistical analyses are used , and // the probability of experimental results being nothing but random or chance happenings can be calculated . Statistics is a mathematical study of probability , and is a powerful tool in science . Statistical analysis will not interpret experiments for us ; it will tell us only what the chances are that our results can be interpreted at all . This is an important thing , however , and makes the study of chance quite significant in science . As we will see in more detail later in the chapter , in the realm of subatomic physics , probability mathematics has come into great prominence . This emphasis on probability has come about simply because in working with these very small particles , we have had to abandon strict cause and effect ideas , as was pointed out in the last chapter . If cause and effect can not be detected or measured , random activity or pure chance seems to be the only alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that probability is to play a big role in the shape of scientific knowledge . An understanding of the general principles involved is , therefore , important in our exploration of the structure of science . Then let us set these matters of science aside for a little while and see what can be learned from playing with a pair of dice . Examination of a single die shows us that it is a cube , with each of its six sides identical in size . We also observe that each side is marked with a number of spots , ranging from one to six , without omission or duplication . If we drop the die on the table , it always comes to rest with one of its six sides uppermost , and thereby displays some number between one and six . This it does every time that it is dropped or rolled ; there is no possibility of its failing to do so . The probability of rolling some number between one and six is a certainty ; it will happen every time . We can express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of successes divided by the number of attempts . In the case of a certainty , the number of successes is equal to the number of attempts , and the probability equals I/i or I. Since the die does not have a blank side nor a side with seven spots , there is not the slightest possibility of rolling a zero or any number // higher than six . The probability of such an impossible event is o/i or o . The range of probability for any system whatsoever is from i ( certainty ) to o ( impossibility ) . Since the die has six equal sides , there is no way of predicting which side is going to turn up when the die comes to rest . There is no reason to believe that one number will turn up any more often than another number . There are six possible numbers , and it is certain that one of them must turn up . Each particular number should turn up in about 1/6 of the rolls , therefore . If we roll the die a thousand times , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 166 times . The probability of rolling any particular number is 1/6 . The probability of rolling a four is 1/6 . Suppose that we roll a four ; what is the probability of rolling another four on the next toss ? It is still 1/6 . Dice have no memory , and probability is not based on a retroactive " law of averages . " If we have not yet rolled the die , what is the probability of rolling four twice in a row ? The probability of the first four is 1/6 . The probability of the second four is one sixth of one sixth ( 1/6 x 1/6 ) , which equals 1/36 . But if the first four is accomplished , it immediately drops out of consideration , and the probability of the second four is the same as for any other number between one and six , namely 1/6 . Now let us add the other die , so that we are playing with a pair of dice . The situation becomes more complicated than it was with just the one , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , it must be seen that each die is independent of the other , and everything that was said about one die in the preceding paragraph applies to each . What we are now interested in is the combination of two dice , at least to the extent of adding the numbers that turn up on each die each time that they are rolled . It is a certainty that two numbers must turn up at each toss , and that neither of the numbers can be less than one or more than six . It is obvious , then , that the combined total must always be between two and twelve . Where each die must show any one of six numbers , the possible specific combinations of numbers with two dice is 6 x 6 , or 36. 99
