Lew Burdette must move over , Bob Turley tip his hat in respect . Last week a young ( 21 ) pitcher named Kazuhisa Inao completed one of the most amazing baseball feats ever . With his team behind 0-3 in Japan 's world series , Inao pitched in the next four games , won all four to pull out the series . In the process , the broad-shouldered righthander pitched 26 consecutive scoreless innings , went 18 innings without walking a man . <P> The son of a fisherman , Inao is tall for a Japanese ( 5 ft. 9 in. , 165 Ibs. ) , is nicknamed " Sai , " which means rhinoceros . He began his baseball career as a catcher ( " The school team was short of a catcher , and I did not know the catcher 's position was scorned " ) , switched to pitching in high school ; signed by the Nishitetsu Lions , Inao helped pitch his team to pennants in 1956 and 1957 , won a total of 56 games in two years . This year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games out of first place-despite the fact that Inao had already won 16 games . Inao solved that problem with a late-season burst , winning 13 games in a row . <P> Of the seven series games against the Yomiuri Giants , Inao pitched in six . In the opening game the heavy-hitting Giants pickled his slider , beat him 9-2 . He sat out the second game ( won by Yomiuri 7-3 ) , came back after two days of rest to lose a 1-0 heartbreaker , even though he allowed only three hits and walked nobody . The rain forced a day 's postponement , and Inao 's luck changed . He beat the Giants 6-4 . Next day he relieved in the fourth inning , won his own game 4-3 with a tenth-inning homer . Inao got a two-day break as the teams switched cities , then he was back on the mound again . He hurled a three-hit 2-0 shutout to square the series , returned the next day to apply the clincher 6-1 . " Unbelievable . " said Eddie Stanky of the touring St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another nine innings . " Said Inao : " I was tired after three games , but I told myself to think of the old days when I rowed my father 's tiny boat in rough seas . Now I feel like an emperor . " His first project : a trip to the grave of his father ( who died this year ) there to report proudly : " Dear father , I have fulfilled our dream . "
