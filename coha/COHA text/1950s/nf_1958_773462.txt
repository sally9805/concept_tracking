txt SIX Travel Is Part of the Pattern With their same-day wirephoto pictures of world events and personalities , and with their wire service coverage of the news , our daily newspapers take us across the seven seas and give us a ringside view of what is going on all over the globe . The magazines , with their color-illustrated travel articles and their coverage of the foreign scene , give us an even broader and deeper picture of the life of the peoples of many lands . Television cameras take us to places where important events are transpiring , at home and abroad . Newsreels give us front row seats at most of the really important happenings around the world . All of these great mediums of communication are at our disposal , and they are worth more intelligent use than most of us make of them . But not one of them , nor all of them together , can quite take the place of foreign travel . Of all the uses of our time , energy , and money that any of us can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign lands , or distant sections of our own country . Travel leaves mental pictures that stay with us always . In memory we re-live our travel experiences many times ? with no further cost in time or money . The newspapers and magazines and books we read become vastly more interesting because we have visited 100 // many of the places mentioned in the news dispatches , or pictured in the magazines , or forming the locale of novels and books of adventure . But even more important , we gain in knowledge of the peoples of other lands and of other sections of our own country . We acquire a better understanding of their modes of life , their problems , and their needs and aspirations . If we have the wisdom to visit them with open minds , we become more tolerant . And tolerance between peoples is perhaps the world 's greatest need today . Since beginning fifteen years ago to observe people 's habits-ofmind with respect to foreign travel , I have discovered that with some people the idea of a trip abroad is about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip will require , or its cost . The oceans seem to act as " water hazards . " As in golf , we tend to tighten up when we face a body of water that must be crossed . It is a pity to permit such a mental hazard to stand in the way of enjoying a trip abroad , or to a distant section of our own country which we have never visited . Now that we can be whisked by air from San Francisco to New York between breakfast and bedtime , or from New York to Mexico City between noon and midnight , or from Chicago to Paris in sixteen or seventeen hours , the time problem has all but ceased to exist . The most common alibi for not taking trips is , " I ca n't get away just now . " The truth is , with most of us the time for taking an extended trip is never quite right ? and it never will be . The only way we will ever do our quota of traveling is to make definite reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how situations iron out when we proceed in businesslike fashion with travel plans . A couple planned a trip to Italy three years ago . They were to fly from New York to Rome . It was to be their first transatlantic flight . The wife was // not well , and as the date of their trip approached she grew extremely nervous . Two days before they were to take off she seemed in no condition to undertake a trip abroad . The husband was in an embarrassing situation , since all plane and hotel reservations had been made through a travel bureau operated by a business friend . He felt that he must have a really good excuse if he was to cancel the accommodations at such a late hour . To cover himself , he decided to get his wife 's doctor to advise that she was not well enough to make the trip . To his surprise the doctor told him , " If I were you I would go ahead . I feel sure a large part of your wife 's trouble is nervous dread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , with no chance to change her mind , I am confident she will snap out of her fears and begin to enjoy herself . " " All right , Doctor , " he said , " you call my wife and tell her you think it will be all right for her to go . " They did go . And , as the doctor had predicted , the wife did " snap out of it . " She was not sick a single day during the entire trip . The couple has since made a second Atlantic flight , with no pre-take-off fears . With air travel available , " I ca n't find the time " is an alibi that no longer holds water . To deny ourselves foreign travel , if we can possibly afford it , is to deny ourselves the most fascinating and stimulating experiences any of us can possibly have . One enterprising couple is following a program of visiting one new country each year for the rest of their lives . They have already visited England , France , Holland , Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greece , Venezuela , Mexico , Panama , Nova Scotia , Bermuda , Hawaii , and Canada , as well as Florida , New England , and the Pacific Coast , the Grand Canyon , Yellowstone Park , and the Arizona Desert . They are never away more than a month . I asked the husband , who is head of a company of medium // size , if it was not difficult for him to take time off from his business for these annual trips . " No , " he said , " several years ago I made an important discovery about taking trips abroad . I found that I do not lose any time from my business . Because I am going to be too far away to be reached easily , I begin months ahead to organize my affairs so that the business will not slow down while I am away . I also ask the head of every department to have his plans ready for my approval a month or two before I am to leave . Often this results in better planning than would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I find myself making a special effort to close important sales contracts so that our plant will have plenty of orders to work on . In fact , in the two or three months before I leave , without quite realizing how , I manage to do an extra month 's work . Because I am working to get the decks cleared for an interesting trip , in spite of the pressure I have put on myself I never feel particularly tired when we take off . " In a sense , " he concluded , " planning for my trips adds a certain momentum to our business which carries it over the periods of my absence . Actually , I suspect it results in more progress than the company would make if I did not take these yearly trips ! " This checks with my own experience . In the past thirty years my wife and I have visited many foreign countries and I have found that most long trips have been self-liquidating in their time expenditure . In anticipation of being away I have put through projects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several months . In effect , I have made or stored time . In addition , I have returned refreshed and enriched in mind and spirit , and full of new ideas . Definitely , travel ? particularly foreign travel ? should be a part of the pattern of a well-regulated life . Charles Darwin wrote , " A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life . " This would seem to leave no time in life for loafing . Happily , such is not the case . But there are wasteless as well as wasteful ways of loafing . The dictionary defines loafing as " passing time lazily or idly ; lounging ; loitering . " In this high-pressure age we seem , by common consent , to have broadened the definition to embrace just about everything we do other than working . Loafing seems to have come to mean " playing hooky . " However we define it , loafing is an important part of the pattern of happy and successful living . We should never lose sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop from time to time to sip life in leisurely fashion . The art of loafing wisely is to use all of our time intelligently , balancing loafing against work , since both contribute importantly to our over-all progress . One way to do this , as brought out in a previous chapter , is to charge our subconscious minds with the elements of a problem or project , and then go fishing , or take a snooze , or " just sit , " ? or whatever form of loafing happens to appeal to us ? and let 104 // the fireless-cooker section of our minds work on it , without bothering our conscious minds about the problem or project , for the time being . Ideas will often come popping out when we least expect them . I imagine Charles Darwin often loafed in this intelligent fashion . An especially valuable time-and-energy-saving form of loafing is what might be called " contemplative loafing " : spending some time looking over our plans or projects in leisurely fashion in advance of plunging into them . Many years ago I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that on taking the contract to build a church in Rotterdam , this old gentleman took three months of smoking for pure consideration of the work ; then three more months in knocking his head and breaking his pipe against every church on a circuitous journey from Rotterdam through Amsterdam , Delft , Haarlem , Leyden , and The Hague and back to Rotterdam ; then three more in walking and navigating and climbing to attain coigns of vantage for contemplating the site of the still unbuilt church . At last , having smoked three hundredweight of tobacco and contemplated the city for a full twelve months , and having filled the good Rotterdammers with the fidgets because they thought he had been loafing all this time , he pulled off his coat and laid the cornerstone of the church . History records that when completed this church was so conveniently located and comfortably constructed that all the zealous Christians of Rotterdam preferred it to any other ! Which would seem to prove that there is a time for loafing and a time for working . If all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our work with much less drain on our four forms of energy , and we would use our time to far better advantage . // A successful druggist spent the first ten years of his business life trying to catch up with the bills of his fast-growing business . One day he decided that life was too short to be spent this way , " with the Sheriff about three paces behind me . " In desperation , he went off on a three-day fishing trip to get away from his bills and his worries . In the silence of the woods he confided to himself that he was " a dumb fool " ; that he was working too much and doing too little planning ahead . " I 've tried for ten years to work myself out of this hand-tomouth method of storekeeping without success . Now I 'm going to try loafing and planning my way out , " he informed himself soberly . He decided then and there to " take off an hour or two a day to keep the Sheriff away , " and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting book , shopping , visiting business friends and swapping ideas and experience , taking a stroll or just sitting on a bench in a nearby park , watching life go by . Though he did not realize it , he was giving his subconscious mind a chance to help him with the problems of his business . Within eight months he was discounting his bills and looking around for a bigger store . Thanks to doing a bit of intelligent loafing , he had shaken off the Sheriff and was planning for the expansion of his business . Today he owns five profitable stores . He still devotes an hour or two of the day to " loafing . " There are a great many ways of wasteless loafing which Darwin probably would have sanctioned . What his seemingly uncompromising statement about wasting one hour of time meant , I feel sure , was that there are so many wonderful things to do in this world , and so much to be accomplished , that any man who loafs from sheer laziness or boredom has not really discovered life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " some reader may ask . In defense of the constitutionally lazy person , it must be admitted that there may be a physiological reason for his laziness . One of my business friends who has always had unusual drive told me that until he was in his thirties he thought nearly all the men of his acquaintance were lazy . " Then , one day , " he related , " it suddenly occurred to me that I had been lucky enough to be born with more energy than they . From then on I was more tolerant . " It is true that some people are born with a low energy quotient . It is also true that not all constitutionally lazy people are a drag on society . Some of them learn to manage their laziness ? to make it serve themselves and the world around them . They do this by thinking out simpler ways to do things so that less work is involved , not only for themselves but for others . An official of one of the large automobile companies has made this interesting statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant and ca n't find any easy way to do it , I have a lazy man put on it . He will find an easy way to do it in ten days . Then we adopt his method . " We may become impatient with lazy people , but if we study them objectively we will learn much about the efficient use of time as well as motions . First , they challenge the essentiality of doing a thing at all . Then , if it must be done , they try to do it with the least expenditure of energy . They may use their laziness to earn them more time to loaf , but often we as well as they benefit from their laziness . The old idea that work must be " hard " is as outmoded as the quaint notion which prevailed a generation ago that to be efficacious medicine must be bitter . With all the facilities available to us for doing things easily and quickly , it is silly for us to do anything the hard , time-consuming way , whether mental or physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us should be ashamed that we have not adopted , in our work and our daily living , more of the time- and labor-saving devices and helps that are to be found in catalogs and retail establishments . Many of these devices are the ingenious inventions or developments of lazy people who have used imagination to serve their own laziness , to the profit of all who are wise enough to buy and use them . The world is actually in debt to their laziness ! Another effective form of laziness is represented by the " Let the ants do it " theory of one of my Chicago friends . This man insists that most of us spend entirely too much time doing work that other people could and would do for us , if only we would show them how it would be advantageous to them . This is how he explains his " ant theory " : " If a grocery boy spilled some sugar on the doorstep , the housewife might get a broom and sweep it off . But if there were any ants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would carry every grain of the sugar away , leaving the doorstep perfectly clean . But their purpose would not be the same as hers , because their interest would be different . Her interest would be to clean the doorstep ; theirs would be to store up food . But their interest would result , nevertheless , in a clean doorstep . " This is a simple example of a profound bit of philosophy . Much of our work would be done for us by others , saving us great expenditures of time and energy , if we would spend less time and energy " working hard " and more time showing others how it would profit them to take some of the workload off our shoulders . We have only to recall how Tom Sawyer , in Mark Twain 's famous story , enlisted his playmates in what was to him an onerous job ? whitewashing the fence . He made them see it as a privilege , rather than the chore it was to him . This was a skillful bit of salesmanship by a lazy boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being lazy , he thought his way out of it ! All of us are engaged almost daily in selling something to the world ? our services , our ideas , our plans , our convictions , ourselves . If only we would learn to scatter the " sugar " of what we have to sell , not in terms of our interests but entirely in terms of those we want to influence , the " ants " would pick up the grains and carry them away ? for their own purposes . As a result , we would accomplish more , and make more personal progress , with less expenditure of our own time and energy . There remains one important rule for loafing : We should never half loaf . The way to get value out of loafing is to decide definitely to loaf , or else to decide definitely to work . To play hooky and at the same time chide ourselves for not working is to take all the value out of loafing without getting anything done . This is apt to put us in ill humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as wasting our time . It all adds up to this : occasional periods of loafing are important in everybody 's pattern of everyday living . Not to loaf occasionally is to short-change ourselves , just as truly as overindulgence in loafing will consume our time without giving us a fair return . In that sense Darwin was right when he wrote : " A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life . " EIGHT Patience Is Part of the Pattern Years ago I bought an old farmhouse in New Hampshire and had it remodeled . The dooryard boasted only one small maple tree on the east side of the house , and a spindly ash sapling on the west side . Shade was sorely needed . At the time it seemed hopeless to set out trees . In all probability our family would be through with the place long before any trees we might plant would grow large enough to east any appreciable shade . Fortunately a neighboring farmer was so insistent that " trees grow faster than you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four maples , five elms , and a white birch . Several of them died the first year , and one or two more the second year . Each season I argued , " What 's the use of replacing them ? We are not here the year ' round to tend them , and anyway we shall never enjoy their shade . " " But my farmer-neighbor had more faith in time than I. He insisted that we set out new saplings . I agreed , but with a sense of futility . For the first four or five years nothing much seemed to happen . I was convinced that we had planted trees solely for the benefit of the next generation . What I did not appreciate was that all Ito // this time the trees were struggling to establish their roots . Time was busily working for us , below ground where we could not see the results . Then , one summer when we arrived at the farm , to our surprise we were greeted by a yard full of bushy little trees ! Now , twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nine large shade trees , all of them so healthy and soundly rooted that they have survived two hurricanes without losing a branch . Today our summer home nestles in a beautiful grove of trees which adds greatly to its comfort , and which appreciably increases the value of the place . All because a wise and foresighted neighbor had insisted that time would work for us . " All you need is patience , " he had told me repeatedly . That experience taught me that time always seems slow in prospect and swift in retrospect . Patience is a vitally important part of the pattern of our lives ? patience that outlasts setbacks and discouragements . It is one of the great weaknesses of our generation that we are not willing to wait for our plans to " take root . " In our personal affairs and our business or professional activities we want results overnight . Probably more of our plans are spoiled by our impatience than by almost any other of our shortcomings . Time works quietly , and usually with great efficiency and thoroughness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent partner we should respect and utilize its cooperation more than we do . When we find ourselves pressing too hard , we would do well to follow the sage counsel of a man who for years has been an adviser to executives in high positions in commerce and industry . Standing off and watching these men strain to reach their objectives , and appreciating that time is fleeting and the price of progress is hard driving , nevertheless every so often he writes a // cryptic note of just eight words to one or another of these captains of industry : " Try resting on your oars for a while . " This man knows there are times when people or situations can not be hurried ; that if we relax temporarily and let the current carry us we will save ourselves an enormous waste of mental and nervous energy . When we rest on our oars and watch developments with a mind free of any sense of frustration , we can see the situation more clearly . Because of this , we can move swiftly and confidently when progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain rather than lose time . There is , indeed , an art to using patience that is at once a specific for outwitting our natural impatience , and a technique for using our time and energy to the fullest advantage . It has already been described on an earlier page of this book , but it will bear repeating . It is Dr. Charles W. Eliot 's simple specific : " When blocked in an enterprise I had much at heart , I always turned immediately to another field of work where progress looked possible , biding my time for a chance to resume the obstructed road . " Often we can profitably rest on our oars so far as a particular project is concerned if we busy ourselves in some other area . While patience is truly a virtue , we must learn to use our patience . This story is told of the great pianist , Ignace Paderewski : On one of his tours he was playing before a large audience in a Canadian city . After the recital a young lady , who possessed considerable musical talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank him for his wonderful concert . " What infinite patience you must have had to learn to play as you did this evening ! " she exclaimed impulsively . A slow smile crossed Paderewski 's face . " I have no more patience than anybody else , my dear young lady , " he said . " The difference is that I have used mine . " There is a Spanish proverb that reads : " In war patience is // more often of service than force . " This is true in the whole process of living . Patience is largely a matter of adjusting our minds and spirits to the realities of a present situation , and then making ourselves as comfortable as possible . The more completely we relax , so far as this special situation is concerned , and actively devote ourselves to other interests , the more likely we will be to shorten the time of waiting . A wise exercise of patience has the further virtue of helping us to keep our perspective so that we can more readily recognize any turn or development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . When that time arrives , usually the desired result can be achieved quickly and easily . " All human power is a compound of time and patience , " wrote the brilliant French author , Honore de Balzac . Power and patience ? the two are inseparable . If we do not learn the art of patience in outwaiting time , we will never make the progress we might . Patience is a vitally important part of the pattern of success , in business , in the professions , and in home and community life . NINE Impatience Also Is Part of the Pattern While it is true that impatience is the cause of a great many of our mistakes and much of our unhappiness , it is equally true that there are times when impatience is a solid virtue . A plan or project important to us seems to get stuck on a dead center . We try patience . Nothing happens . We turn to something else for the time being , and presently return to our project only to find it is still blocked . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are stymied . We fret . In our frustration we burn up a great deal of nervous energy . When we arrive at this state it is time to take a good look at the situation and ask ourselves : Has patience ceased to be a virtue ? Has the time arrived to make things happen ? The ability to make things happen is one of the prime essentials to any person 's success and progress . Oddly enough , though , it is usually based on patience ? up to a point . Time is a wonderful First Assistant , capable of taking care of many of the details and setting the stage for us to go into action . But in some situations there comes an hour or day when we arrive at the conviction that time has done all it can do to " ready " a situation for us . If we are to make progress , we must act . 114 // The problem is to decide when this time has arrived . In the small affairs of daily life , as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide-point which William Shakespeare immortalized in the often quoted but ever fresh and cogent lines : There is a tide in the affairs of men , Which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune ; Omitted , all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries . And we must take the current when it serves , Or lose our ventures . The art is in recognizing this tide-point before we " lose our ventures . " In the nature of things , there are forces at work ? inertia , opposition , doubt , timidity ? which tend to hold up , if not actually block , nearly every important plan or project any of us ever conceives . There are also times when these forces must be respected , when the obstacles are too big to overcome . But we should be sure they really are controlling influences , and not merely arguments for inaction . We should not permit ourselves to be easily satisfied . Our days slip over the horizon so swiftly that we can miss much of the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long . Of course , it is always possible that the delay we are fuming about is our own responsibility . It is human nature for us to blame others for our own sins of omission . Before doing so we would do well to ask ourselves several searching questions : Am I waiting for others to do something that I should be doing myself ? Have I overlooked some seemingly unimportant factor which may actually be controlling ? Have I failed to make the project clear to any of the people whose cooperation I need ? // Am I guilty of procrastination myself in making decisions or taking action ? Would I favor the project myself if someone else were sponsoring it ? Such questions are wholesome to face , for sometimes they reveal that we are not doing everything we might , that our impatience should be turned on ourselves . It is foolish not to look at every situation through other people 's eyes , not to listen to other people 's counsel , not to heed other people 's experience , not to weigh other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked , listened , and weighed all the factors soberly , sensibly , and self-critically , if we still have a strong conviction that we ought to go ahead , then we have arrived at the tide-point . The time for patience is past ; impatience should take over . The world is cluttered up with unfinished business in the form of projects that might have been successful , if only at the tidepoint someone 's patience had turned to activated impatience . How can we judge when we have reached this tide-point ? The president of one of America 's fastest-growing corporations , who is noted for his patience and yet moves with breath-taking speed when it runs out , once told me : " When I get a bone feeling ' that the time for action has come ? I act ! " What he meant was that when he felt to the very marrow of his bones that further waiting would be a mistake , he acted ? not from impatience , but from deep conviction . This is an important distinction . This may explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arise out of impatience . The late Theodore N. Vail told me that , while he might sometimes appear to do so , he had never in his life made a snap decision . He explained that his mind often worked on a problem for weeks or // months . Then ? and this often happened in a moment of seeming impatience ? he reached a decision and acted ? fast . All through life , in our business or professional careers , in our social life , and in home and family affairs , it is necessary to watch for the tide-points and , when we get a " bone feeling , " to act ! For impatience is definitely a part of the pattern of successful living . TEN The Vital Importance of Re-Creation There is one word in the English language which seems to fall short of adequately conveying its deeper meaning . That word is " recreation . " We tend to think of recreation as participation in games , sports , and other time-consuming activities ; whereas so small a unit of time as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as will presently be demonstrated . If we insert a hyphen between the word 's first and second syllables , thus ? re-creation ? it becomes one of the best picture-words in the language . This is why it will be so spelled wherever it occurs from here on in this book . The purpose of re-creation is to re-fresh , re-vitalize , re-create us , physically and mentally , and in energy-of-the-spirit . Certainly it should rate high in our pattern of living in its claim for a portion of our time . For unless we do re-create ourselves frequently we " burn our candle at both ends . " In so doing we overdraw on our energy account . Thereby we may actually curtail our days in two respects : first by shortening the time each day when we are at our best ; second , by drawing so heavily on our store of energy that , if we fail to replenish it frequently , we may very well shorten our life span . Many men do just that , as the obituary columns testify . 118 // This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into health of body , health of mind , health of spirit . Had we all the time in the world , without health to use and enjoy it , we would be time-poor . No matter how busy we are , we owe it to ourselves to plan definitely to take time out for re-creation . The overburdened business executive or professional man who takes an afternoon off once a week to play golf is very likely using his time wisely . Half a day of enjoyable exercise in the open air serves to stimulate his circulation , rest his mind , and refresh his spirit . He returns to his heavy work-load with a fresh store of at least three forms of energy . Furthermore , by giving his conscious mind a much-needed rest from all the problems pressing on him , he provides his subconscious mind an opportunity to " take over " for a few hours . And that is the time the subconscious mind works best ? when the body and mind are relaxed . Again , to quote from The Knack of Using Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subconscious minds problem-assignments , and then turn to other matters , with no further conscious concern about the problem for the time being . I le counsels the would-be user of the subconscious mind : Seek complete mental relaxation by turning to some activity you especially enjoy . Play golf , read a detective story , lunch or ( line well and leisurely , go to a concert or the movies , play bridge or canasta , take a brisk walk , or do something that requires skill of hand . Consciously tune out the conscious mind , as you would turn off a radio or television program . Let it go on a vacation . While it is possible to overdo sports to the neglect of our responsibilities , an occasional game of golf or tennis , a swim , a hike , a sail , or whatever our favorite form of exercise may be , is often the wisest possible investment of part of our time , even when we arc very busy . // Re-creation and self-examination can often be combined to correct our perspective . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which men and women with heavy responsibilities might well adopt : After each major undertaking ? and particularly when things had turned sour ? I would shake loose from Wall Street and go off to some quiet place where I could review what I had done and where I had gone wrong . At such times I never sought to excuse myself but was concerned solely with guarding against a repetition of the same error . Periodic self-examination of this sort is something all of us need , in both private and governmental affairs . It is always wise for individuals and governments to stop and ask whether we should rush on blindly as in the past . Have new conditions arisen which require a change of direction or pace ? Have we lost sight of the essential problem and are we simply wasting our energies on distractions ? What have we learned that may help us avoid repeating the same old errors ? i The serious consequences of working with a tired mind are dealt with in another paragraph in Mr. Baruch 's book : Late in 1945 when General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending a week end at Hobcaw , I remarked to him how important it was for the top officials of government to be able to look beyond the immediate pressures of the day to the looming problems on the horizon . Nodding his head vigorously , he told me , " Early in the war I instructed every officer assigned to the General Staff to get away from Washington for a day or two each week . I did n't want tired minds making decisions that would affect the lives of millions of soldiers . " 1 Happily , our recreation can often be worked into business or professional life in such a way as to provide re-creation . For example , a very successful New York advertising agency head , who is an all-around sportsman , makes up a list , about once in i Baruch , Bernard , Baruch : My Own Story . Reprinted with permission of the publishers , Henry Holt and Company , New York . // three months , of business and professional men with whom he would like to play golf or take for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , sometimes a fortnight ahead . Usually he succeeds in pretty well covering his list each quarter . I asked him bluntly if this was not done for business purposes . " No , " he replied , " at least not primarily . I do it because as an advertising man it is necessary for me to keep my mind stimulated , to know what people in various industries and professions are thinking and planning , and to keep making fresh contacts . Some of the people I entertain may be helpful to me in a business way at some time , but I never consciously cultivate ' a man because I think I might sign him up as a client . That would spoil all the fun . I like people , and I aim to have as wide a circle of interesting friends as I possibly can in the limited time at my disposal . " It is by no means necessary to spend days or half-days in re-creation . Minutes will often suffice . I happen to be one of those persons who is not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise . Yet I have been blessed with exceptionally good health all my life . But I do indulge in ten minutes of re-creation each morning , pinning through Walter Camp 's famous exercises known as the " Daily Dozen . " How important these ten minutes are to my wellbeing was brought home to me a while ago when I cracked a rib and for more than a month had to forego my brief but brisk morning workout . During that month I started each day with a mental and physical heaviness that was hard to shake off . I had not been able to stretch my muscles , get the kinks out of my joints , and limber up the vertebrae of my spinal column . I was like a confirmed coffee drinker suddenly deprived of his customary two cups of coffee for breakfast . Instead of plunging into the day with zest I had to struggle to " get going . " For the first hour or so I had a sense of working at low efficiency . // My introduction to the Daily Dozen offers further proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago I had an appointment one afternoon with Walter Camp . At that time he was doubling as president of the New Haven Clock Company and Yale 's head football coach . It was in the former capacity that I was calling on him . When I entered his office he was standing in the middle of the room with his coat off , both arms stretched straight up in the air , fingers extended . Ignoring me , he proceeded very slowly to bend his body forward without bending his knees , and his outstretched arms began ever so slowly to describe an arc toward the floor . It took a fraction of a minute to complete this arc and touch the floor with the tips of his fingers . Then he straightened up just as slowly , stood still for a few seconds , slipped on his coat , and sank easily into his swivel chair , a completely relaxed man . I felt like I had been watching a slow-motion movie . " You caught me taking one of my sixty-second vacations , " he said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning and twice in the afternoon . It gives me a fresh start for another couple of hours of concentrated work . " Then he proceeded to " sell " me on his Daily Dozen exercises , for which I shall always feel deeply indebted to him . A friend who is a " bug " on deep breathing tells me that taking a few deep breaths once every hour or so , preferably in the open air or by an open door or window , re-creates him . " Deep breathing increases the oxygen supplied to your blood and your blood stream says Thank you kindly , ' " is his picturesque way of expressing it . This man says that during the day whenever he faces an especially difficult task , or when he has to make an important decision , or put in an important telephone call , he pauses first // and slowly takes three or four very deep breaths . " My blood stream freshens , my thinking is clearer , and I feel more poised and confident , " he declares . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to work . It is a fraction of a second of re-creation . One of the fastest and most popular checkers in a metropolitan supermarket formed the habit years ago of pausing between saying " Thank you " to the customer she has just served and starting to ring up the next customer 's purchases . During this brief pause she looks up and says a smiling " Good morning " or " Good afternoon " to the newcomer . " This tiny break in the routine of checking really refreshes me , " she says . " What 's more , it keeps me reminded that each customer is a human being ? and that I am tool This makes my work more enjoyable . " Whether she knows it or not , this young lady is cooperating intelligently with Mother Nature . The human heart is the hardestworking and most tireless machine in the world . But even the heart has to take a rest between beats . Her ever-so-brief pauses give it that much better chance to rest . Of course , sleep is the greatest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store energy-of-the-spirit as well as of the mind , muscles , and nervous system . We wake up in a conquering mood . We tackle difficult tasks with a confidence and a vigor that doubles , triples , and sometimes quadruples the usevalue of the hours of the new day . Hence , anything we can do to insure sound and refreshing sleep is worth doing ; anything we can buy to the same end ( provided it is not habit-forming drugs ) is a rare bargain . George Matthew Adams quotes a man who told him : " I bought an annuity . Now that I have bought it , I know that I have bought sleep . " , // One of the most important steps in providing ourselves with all the time we need is to make a special study of ourselves with relation to this problem of sleep re-creation . A woman who holds an important position in a metropolitan department store , and who had trouble nearly every night getting to sleep because her mind was grappling with her next day 's work , cured herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mentally reviewed the accomplishments and satisfactions of the day just closed , " to tuck away in my spirit , " as she expressed it . This proved to have a relaxing effect , and she tells me she often drifts off before she finishes her review . Her day ends on a note of accomplishment rather than worry about tomorrow . Many people have discovered that reading a short poem or essay , or a chapter of the Bible , just before they turn off the light , clears their minds of the day 's cares and they sink peacefully into their pillows . A research scientist connected with a paint company , whose job involves long periods when he has little to show for his work , found himself worrying each night over his lack of visible progress . Blessed with a keen and active sense of humor , one night while undressing he composed this jingle : A research man is full of fear Because he thinks his boss may jeer ; But he should work without a tear Because the whole wide world will cheer And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brand new smear ! As he settled into his pillow he kept repeating this until he went off to sleep with a grin on his face . Silly , of course , but it became his specific for getting off to sleep . And certainly no sillier than counting sheep . Each of us could profitably experiment until we have found // some specific , sound or silly , for closing the books on our day 's work and drifting peacefully off to sleep . Someone has said , " Time is the one thing we never have enough of when we are well , and too much of when we are sick . " Many of us waste time in illnesses which could have been avoided , had we used our common sense . Our minds and bodies often try to warn us that we are storing up trouble for ourselves , but we do not heed them . We are " too busy . " Then one day , suddenly , we have much too much time on our hands ? in bed ! It may or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inexcusable waste of time . Too many of us wait until we are really ill before we consult a physician . Then we expect him to kill our pain or patch us up in a matter of hours so we can get back into circulation . I learned a different approach from an old family doctor . " At the first symptom of any kind of illness , " he advised , " even a simple headache , make up your mind that you are abusing yourself in some way , whether you realize it or not . Review everything you are doing . Check your diet , your bowels , your tongue , your pulse , your temperature , the use you are making of your eyes , and any possible neglect of normal precautions . Nature is trying to tell you something : What ? " It may not be necessary for you to visit your doctor . Consult your common sense ? but listen to what it advises ! " If you are really ill , then give your doctor a chance to help you by calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to develop complications . Tell him you are not interested in being fixed up ' ; that you want to get at the cause of your trouble . If he recommends a physical examination , have it done promptly . No matter how busy you may be , in the end it is likely to save von much time . Nature is a powerful friend if you take her into partnership and follow her rules . But she is full of unpleasant slit f ) rises if you do not keep on good terms with her ? or persist in // doing things you know well enough you should not do , " he concluded . The doctor spoke wisely . Good health is worth all the time it calls for . " Putting off " so often means waking up one day to the fact that Nature is ready to punish us for our failure to take care of ourselves , or to heed her warnings . Then we lose time with a vengeance . Not just days and weeks , but in many cases months . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Mille so truly says , " Some of the saddest words ever written are those in the Book of Common Prayer : We have left undone those things which we ought to have done . ' " 1 Certainly this applies to any neglect of our health , either because we are " too busy " to get a checkup , or because we " have n't time " to take the precautions we ought to be taking . As for our retirement years , the illnesses of age usually result from earlier abuses of the energy forms of our time , which control its use-value . Unfortunately , too few of us give any thought to this until we get well along in years and suffer a heart attack or a stroke . Then we regret our carelessness in assuming that we had an unlimited store of energy to draw on . The most effective way to store years of useful time for the last part of life is to invest our energy wisely during our active years . Re-creation and proper attention to our health and living habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , if we are to enjoy life , maintain our earning capacity , and continue to make satisfactory progress . ELEVEN Recharge the Batteries of Your Spirit Of the four forms of energy which we can call upon to multiply the effectiveness of our hours and days , perhaps the most potent is energy-of-the-spirit . As brought out in an earlier chapter , this form of energy translates into confidence , creativeness , enthusiasm , inspiration , resourcefulness . It flows through us like an electric current , sparking our spirits and energizing us into action and accomplishment . Suppose we think of this current as available in two different " voltages , " as is household electricity with its 110-volt and 220-volt currents . The lower-voltage current of energy-of-the-spirit produces the buoyancy and drive that comes from being healthy , happy , interested in our work , ambitious to accomplish things , determined to make progress . The higher-voltage current draws on a deeper source of power , a source outside ourselves . It is this powerful current that gives some men and women flashes of inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put through mighty undertakings , the power to influence great masses of people . It makes them leaders . From what source comes this high-voltage current of powerof the-spirit ? 127 // Many years ago Ralph Waldo Trine wrote a book 1 with a very big concept : that the great central fact of life is our oneness with the Infinite ; that to keep " in tune " with this **25;123;TOOLONG is the secret of greatness . This concept can be one of the most important elements in any individual 's pattern of timeuse . Regardless of the term we use , or how we picture the Infinite , God is the supreme fact of existence . We can draw on Him for unlimited strength , courage , and power-to-achieve . To do this it is not necessary to become involved in this or that brand of theology , or to become entangled in metaphysics . We need only accept with simple faith the realization that God 's attitude toward us is perfect , and that to draw on His power we have only to put ourselves in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude in four simple words : " Thy will be done . " This attitude is the secret of greatness ? provided it comes from the heart . To draw on this higher-voltage current we need only take time out from our daily and weekly routine for those spiritual activities which lift us out of ourselves and keep us " in tune with the Infinite . " This may mean attending church services , listening to inspiring sermons , singing stirring hymns . Many of us derive spiritual recreation from the weekly investment of an hour or two in worshipping with kindred souls . Or it may mean turning to the more intimately personal practice of prayer . In one of his books , Richard Llewellyn quotes a Welsh parson 's prescription for prayer : " Prayer is another name for good , clean , direct thinking . When you pray , think well what you are saying , and make your thoughts into things that are solid . // In that manner your prayer will have strength , and that strength shall become part of you , mind , body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into words or pray silently in our hearts , we will do well to ask for : Faith in ourselves ; Courage to face our responsibilities ; Strength to carry our burdens ; Fortitude to shoulder our troubles ; Enterprise to grasp our opportunities ; Wisdom to choose wisely how we shall invest our talents and our time and energy . Prayer requires that we look up from our work and take time to " talk with God . " There is no reason why this can not become as natural for us as it is for the mariner to glance up at the North Star for his bearings . Such a recharging of our batteries-of-the-spirit can be a most important part of the pattern of successful and satisfying living . TWELVE Worry Should Be Left Out of the Pattern A story is told of President Calvin Coolidge that sets a pattern for all of us in these troubled years of world-wide strife and tension . At a time when Washington was beset with troublesome problems , a caller at the White House commented to the President that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution of the United States ? " the President asked . " Yes , " replied his caller . " Well , do you find anything in it that says a President must worry ? " When you come to think of it , there is n't any clause in the Constitution that says any of us must worry ! When we do , it usually means that our worries are managing us , rather than we managing them . Dr. Eliot , whose philosophy of outwitting frustrations was described in a previous chapter , had an equally effective way of warding off his worries . In answer to a question as to how he managed to live so serenely , he said , " I try to cultivate a calm nature , expectant of good . " He had trained himself to expect everything about his work 130 // and his life to turn out all right ? in the long run . Meanwhile , he did not permit his mind to worry over things which might go wrong . It seems to be a common human failing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will happen . We make ourselves miserable on the foolish theory that we are " steeling ourselves " against trouble by anticipating the worst . This sounds sensible in theory , but the theory crumbles when we apply our common sense . For , just about three-quarters of the time , the worst does not happen . Which means that the trouble-anticipator has needlessly consumed a great deal of mental and nervous energy , and in so doing has undermined the use-value of his time to no purpose whatsoever . Even when something we fear actually does materialize , is it not enough to have it consume our energy once , rather than doubling the waste by worrying about it in advance ? Worry saps the spirit and drains the nervous system of its precious energy at an appalling rate . If each of us were equipped with a mental indicator , with a dial hand which registered our energy consumption as the dial hand of an electric meter shows the consumption of electricity , we would be startled at how rapidly this hand would move when we worry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stop if we adjusted ourselves mentally and spiritually to our situation , and resolutely refused to worry about it . None of us can hope to go through life without plenty of causes for worry ; but if we capitulate to them we are sunk . I t is , of course , sensible to be sufficiently concerned over a threatening situation to take all the practical steps we can to protect ourselves from trouble . Having worked out a possible plan for meeting a problem or difficulty , no useful purpose will he served by thinking any more about it . Rather , we should get on with our affairs , conserving our energy for use when it will he needed . Thomas Dreier writes of a Florida hermit who died at the age // of seventy-six , a serene and happy old man . Before closing his eyes for the last time he remarked , " I ai n't been blue since 1912 , and I forget now what worried me then ! " e ? For most of us , having a wise philosophy is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my own case , starting with Dr. Eliot 's philosophy of cultivating " a calm nature , expectant of good , " years ago I added a two-step technique for actually taking worries in hand and doing my level best to manage them . The first step is to crystallize the worry by writing on a slip of paper : " I am beginning to worry about . . . " Sometimes I find that I ca n't frame a convincing statement of my worry when I try to put it into words . This shows me that I face no real worry , but only a vague dread or fear , usually the result of being overly tired or a bit low in spirit . In this situation the first step has proved effective ; my worry begins to evaporate and my mind to clear . But frequently I find I can phrase a statement , which proves that there is a worry to be managed . Then it is in order to take a second step : meet the worry half way . With many of us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is we are dreading to catch up with us . After a time the worry wears a groove in our minds and begins to revolve in a circle , like a phonograph with the needle stuck in a groove on the record , repeating one theme endlessly . The longer we worry the deeper the groove wears . Finally a form of worry-paralysis sets in . The effective antidote to such worry is action . If we start out to meet a worry halfway by doing something , either to ward off the development we fear or to prepare in practical fashion to meet it when it does hit us , we will lift much of the worry-load from our minds and spirits . For example : // Is there a telephone call we can make ? perhaps long distance ? that will relieve our minds ? Is there someone we can go to see to get the situation straightened out before it starts to fester ? Can we write a letter that will clear up a misunderstanding ? Is there a friend we can consult who will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few dollars , do something that will lift the load of our worry ? Can we plunge into some activity that will prepare us to meet the situation which we are anticipating with such dread ? Action ? Action ? ACTION ! This , instead of letting our worry blind us to simple steps we might be taking to relieve our minds . On one occasion I found myself deeply worried because I had agreed to complete an important commission by a certain date . I could see that I was not going to be able to meet this promise , and my reputation was at stake . The confidence of the client was so important to me that my worry grew acute . It was interfering with my working effectiveness , thus slowing me down still more . I realized that worry was burning energy that I ought to be using on the project I was trying to finish . What could I possibly d0 about it ? At least I could warn my client in advance . Then I would be able to work with a free mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in a long-distance call . " Just how soon do you actually need the report I am working on ? " I asked . " Oli , " he said , " any time within the next two or three weeks will be soon enough . I thought I was going away on a trip , but nip plans have changed and there is no rush . " That long-distance telephone call banished my worry and con134 A Pattern for Truly Successful Living served a vast amount of mental and nervous energy . I easily finished the job well ahead of the date it was needed . Action had banished worry ! One morning I received the following letter from a man with whom I had once discussed the action technique of managing worry , which read : You will be interested , I am sure , in how I put your " action technique " to a test a few weeks ago . As I believe you know , we have been expecting a baby in our family . My wife had been seriously ill for several weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no food on her stomach . Every day she grew thinner and weaker . I was genuinely worried ? more worried than I have ever been in my life . Last Tuesday morning I woke up with the realization that here was a situation calling for action . If I could n't do anything else , at least I would find out the worst . Anything but this terrible uncertainty . I called the doctor and made an appointment to see him privately in his office . " I want the unvarnished truth , " I told him . " Well , frankly , " said the doctor , " I had thought there would be a turn for the better in your wife 's condition by now . If there is no improvement by the time I make my regular call at your house tomorrow afternoon , I fear the baby will have to be taken to save your wife 's life . " Dark as the prospects were , all the way home I felt better for having boldly taken the situation in hand . I was so relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day that I entered my wife 's sickroom with a strong sense of confidence . " Well , I dropped in at the doctor 's this afternoon , " I announced cheerfully . Then , on a sudden impulse , I said , " He told me there really ought to be a definite turn for the better by the time he calls tomorrow afternoon . " I noticed a flicker of hope in her eyes at the license I had taken with the doctor 's statement , and went on boldly , " From now on you should begin to improve rapidly . " Before morning there was a marked change for the better in her condition . I called the doctor and posted him on what I had // told my wife , and on its effect . When he called that afternoon he found her sitting up in bed for the first time in weeks . And she had taken a little solid food . " The turn I had hoped for has come , " he announced briskly . " You are definitely on the mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His prediction proved accurate . Thanks to turning a fearsome worry into action , my amateur psychology did what medicines had not been able to do . We are expecting the baby any day now . I am all for the " action technique . " It works ! This intimate letter has been quoted in full , with the consent of my correspondent , because it illustrates three important points : First , that action brings mental relief . Even though this man learned that the baby might have to be taken , the very fact that something was going to be done broke his worry-paralysis . Second , that going into action stimulates our resourcefulness , and frequently results in bold and creative thinking . Third , that when we take action on a worry , what we start to do may not be the thing we end doing . In fact , our action may veer off in an entirely different direction than we intended . Once we start out boldly to meet a worry half way , it is surprising how often an unexpected path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action technique works with all kinds of worries ? business and professional , home and family , financial , health and personal . It is an amazingly successful method of outwitting worry and quickly ending a reckless waste of energy of mind and spirit . Of course , there are situations in which we are powerless to take any sensible action . But worry will not help . As Trotty Veck put it so wisely , " There are two things about which one should never worry : that which can not be helped and that which can be . " The latter we can do something about . And we should . Abraham Lincoln led a tragic life in a troubled era . He had to grapple with snperhnnian problems . Ile was misunderstood , // bitterly criticized , and unjustly maligned . But he had a philosophy which kept his spirit from curdling and his mind from burning itself out with worry . Happily it has been preserved for us in his own words : I do the very best I know how ? the very best I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . If the end brings me out all right , what is said against me wo n't amount to anything . If the end brings me out wrong , then ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference . . , . No discussion of worry would be complete without reminding ourselves that we often make ourselves miserable worrying over some anticipated trouble , only to have it turn out to be a blessing in disguise . Some years ago I made a list of the seven major worries of my life up to that time . I traced what had actually happened . To my surprise , five of these anticipated troubles , which at the time had loomed as almost catastrophic , had worked out to be great good fortune . And the other two had been far less serious in their consequences than I had anticipated . It was then that I adopted Dr. Eliot 's sound philosophy of cultivating " a calm nature expectant of good . " Definitely , worry is one thing that should be left out of the pattern for truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the factors that make up the pattern of living , perhaps none is quite so important to our daily and hourly happiness as the practice of rewarding ourselves , in little ways and big , as part of our routine . When , for example , we manage to do something so quickly that , unexpectedly , we have a bit of time left over , we can afford to reward ourselves by indulging , even if only momentarily , in some activity that will give us special pleasure , instead of overconscientiously keeping on plugging . When we complete a big job that may have taken us days or weeks , if it is at all possible it will profit us to reward ourselves by taking a day off to do something which will refresh us in mind and spirit . One of my New York friends took an early plane to Boston one morning on business . So carefully had he planned his mission that , instead of taking the whole day as he had anticipated , his assignment was completed before noon . His first impulse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recalling a discussion we had had on the rewarding idea , he decided that this was a fine opportunity to test it . Accordingly , he resolved to give himself a half-holiday and do some of the 137 // things he had long wanted to do in Boston . First he telephoned an old college friend and found that he had a free lunch hour . They lunched at one of the famous eating places in the Faneuil Hall section and had a fine visit . After lunch he visited Faneuil Hall , the Old State House , and the Old North Church . There was still time for an hour at the Museum of Fine Arts before taking a plane back to New York . He arrived home , thoroughly refreshed in mind and spirit , at the time he had originally expected to return . Should not all of us take advantage of every opportunity to give ourselves such little unexpected holidays for our good behavior in wisely using our time ? Often an unanticipated hour of complete freedom to follow our inclinations will do us more good than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to maintain a sound sense of proportion in the investment of our days and hours , and to remember that our spirits need refreshment as much as do our bodies . Is there a better way to give ourselves a spiritual lift than to surprise ourselves at frequent intervals with wholly unexpected " vacations " that have been earned as a result of the intelligent use of our time ? Of course , the rewarding idea can be overdone . Life is a matter of keeping a sensible balance between work and play , accomplishments and rewards . If we see to it that the accomplishment comes first , we can safely indulge in an appropriate reward . One of the fallacies that dilutes our happiness is that we think we are not " working " unless what we are doing seems like work . Yet , as we have already discovered , some of our very best work is done when our minds and spirits are so relaxed that we hardly realize we are working . It is not the hours we spend at work that count , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish more by working less we will begin to mature . // Perhaps the quickest way to learn this valuable lesson is to reward ourselves on every possible occasion ? even if only with a ten-minute vacation ? when we succeed in lopping off minutes or hours from some task because of our efficient handling of it . We need to keep ourselves reminded that life is speeding by and watch for every possible opportunity to pause and savor it , even if only briefly . The practice of rewarding ourselves becomes much simpler if we adopt the " project " concept in connection with our work . If we " draw a mental circle " around a task so that we see it as a project , we will know when we have completed it , or at least carried it as far as we can for the time being . We should then take our bearings and see if this is not a time when we can justifiably reward ourselves . Going back to the master craftsman in metals , mentioned in an earlier chapter , who mentally packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his pre-allotted day 's work ahead of schedule he almost automatically considered three courses : ? Continuing to work on the project , tackling some other part of it ; or ? Turning to another project ; or ? Taking a brief " vacation . " " Oftener than not , " he says , " I adopt the third course , for I believe I am entitled to indulge myself a bit when I have finished a piece of work . But there are times when tackling some other part of the design I am working on , or starting another project , will give me more pleasure than anything else I could possibly do with the vacation ' I have earned . When I find myself in this mood , I push on . For at such times I can work easily and make fast progress . " This brings out the importance of mood . Sometimes , when we // are engaged in a piece of work that is proving thoroughly enjoyable , we may be in a mood to " make a short job long for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem by Robert Frost . To keep on working from a conscientious sense of putting in so many hours is to throw away the rewards of our labor , but to linger over an undertaking that is giving us pleasure is sometimes the finest possible way to reward ourselves . The wonderful thing about indulging ourselves in little rewarddividends is that , as already stressed , our subconscious minds work best when we are doing something particularly pleasurable . That is why some of our best ideas come to us when we are mentally relaxed and enjoying ourselves , with a sense of having earned the right to a brief respite . Reminding myself to practice what I preach , one day recently at a few minutes after twelve I had covered three errands in the city which I had assumed would take the whole day . Instead of contenting myself with a quick lunch and hurrying back to the office and plunging into an afternoon of work , I decided to reward myself . I went to my favorite club and ordered an epicurean luncheon . As I sat eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea popped into my mind for a chapter for this book covering an aspect of time-use which had not previously occurred to me . I made a note of it and continued my luncheon . As I was leaving the club a quarter of an hour later I bethought myself of an exhibit of graphic arts in a nearby gallery . I decided to continue to reward myself by visiting this gallery . As I stood looking at one of the exhibits , a phrase on the title page of one of the fine books on display suggested a solution to a problem that had been bothering me for months . I left the gallery with that problem on the way to solution . On my way uptown my eye was caught by the display in a haberdasher 's window . Two neckties attracted me . " Why not // reward myself with two new ties , while I am in the rewarding mood ? " I asked myself . So I did just that . Toward the latter part of the afternoon I returned to my office , thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might never have conceived while at my desk . Also , with two neckties which in the future will remind me pleasurably of a day well spent ! Living is a very human occupation , and it behooves us to be human with ourselves whenever an opportunity presents itself . The wonderful thing about such little reward-vacations is that often they stimulate our minds as well as our spirits , and frequently result in making light work of the tasks facing us . In the end , we accomplish more with our hours and days ? and our lives ? if we grasp the fleeting opportunities to reward ourselves for the wise use of our hours and energy , than if we keep our noses too close to the grindstone of duty . Those of us whose working days are so ordered that there is no feasible way of rewarding ourselves during business hours should watch for opportunities to do so at other times . If , while we are engaged in an especially difficult or unpleasant task , we begin to think of rewarding ourselves in some way after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less difficult or unpleasant . But , even on the job , there are usually opportunities to lean back and relax , to turn briefly to contacts with people around us whom we particularly like , to stop and enjoy a leisurely smoke , or to spend a little time reading . Life should properly be a balance of accomplishments and rewards , of work and fun . We should get enjoyment out of doing t r work well and meeting and mastering our problems , and then we will be wise to take time out to reward ourselves by engaging In sonic special pleasure . What could be more sensible as part of the pattern for truly succcssful living ? ONE Stop , Look , and Listen to Life Each of us is born into a world of infinite interest and possibilities . If we live to the allotted three score and ten we can anticipate 613,200 hours to invest in life . Awake or asleep they can contribute to our happiness and our accomplishment and progress . Too many of us are letting these precious hours slip past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) keep up with our times , ( 2 ) work out a working-and-living pattern that fits our individual temperaments and situations , ( 3 ) develop working and living habits that utilize our hours and days to the fullest possible advantage . These are the minimum requisites for a program for personal progress . The first problem we face , then , is " keeping up . " Never in the history of man have there been so many facilities available for keeping abreast of ideas and events . The newspapers serve us the news from every corner of the globe ; radio and television provide us with a front seat at important events ; magazines and books keep us posted on what people everywhere are doing , thinking , dreaming . We can avail ourselves of lectures , art exhibits , conventions , concerts , sermons , plays , movies , scientific society meetings ? the list is almost endless . 149 // All these facilities can help us to live . Probably the reason most of us do not take fuller advantage of them is because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life confusing . Because we can not avail ourselves of all of them , we excuse ourselves for not availing ourselves of as many as we might . We allow ourselves to drift through the hours and days and weeks . We are conscious that we are missing much of life , but in too many instances we live in our own little backwater coves until some alert person with a contagious zest for living almost drags us out into the stream of life , to attend an important event , read a significant book , go to an outstanding play or movie , or participate in some worth-while community event . The world owes much to these enterprising people . They are the stirrer-uppers . The seventeen-year-old daughter of a neighbor put me to shame in the matter of keeping abreast and programming her time . This young lady always seems to know what is going on . Mention an important new book and she has either read it or read a review of it . Mention an outstanding movie and more than likely she has seen it . Mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whistle the latest tune and she knows what it is . " How does she do it ? " I asked her mother . " She has no more time than other girls , but she keeps abreast of the world better than almost anyone I know . " " Her system is quite simple , " her mother explained . " She plans her activities for days ahead . On Sunday morning she curls up on the couch with The New York Times and a pad and pencil . First she studies the radio and television pages and notes the programs she wants to tune in during the week . She jots down the date , the station and the time of each program . " Next , she turns to the book review section and reads it quite carefully . If there is a review or an advertisement of any book she very much wants to read , she notes it . On Monday she visits the // lending library or the public library and puts in a request for it , or takes it out if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sunday paper she has skimmed the news pages , the society section , and the art and music pages . If there is a special art exhibit she wants to see , or a lecture or musical event that interests her , she makes a note of the date , time , and place ? and it is surprising how many of these she takes in , either alone or with friends . " Then she goes through our weekly suburban paper in the same way , posting herself on local doings . And , of course , she looks up the movies that are to be shown at our two local movie houses . If there is a conflict between a movie and a television program , she decides which she would rather see and plans accordingly . " " How about the boys ? " I asked . " I was just coming to the boys . She seems to understand the feminine art of getting herself invited to the movies she wants to see , or the sports events or parties she wants to attend . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs she wants to watch . She carries her young crowd along with her ? ' general manages ' them , in a manner of speaking ? and they seem to like it . There is never a dull moment around Barbara ! " Because she knows exactly what she wants to do and see and hear and read , this young lady lives life to the full . What is more , she enjoys a position of leadership in her set . Such meticulous planning of a week would not appeal to some people . But , without scheduling ourselves quite so tightly , all of us could with profit plan ahead much more carefully than we do , making the engagements that are important to us , choosing the books we want to read , the movies we want to see , the radio and television programs we want to tune in , the places we want to go , the people we want to entertain or visit . Such scheduling // would utilize our time much more advantageously than most of us now use it . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day , permitting ourselves to be enticed into fitting into other people 's plans . It would pay all of us to plan much more definitely to take advantage of life 's opportunities , with a program of our own making . The essence of wise time-use is to develop a definite sense of values for ourselves , and then to have the self-discipline to live up to it . It is sometimes necessary to say a courteous but firm " No " to the things other people want us to do , in order to have time to do the things that will result in our own greatest happiness and progress . After all , we have only one life to live . Every hour we waste is an hour gone forever . To manage our time and carry out our own plans does not mean that we must be selfish or uncooperative . But sometimes we must be graciously firm in meeting the demands of our family , our friends , and our business or professional associates . One father has always been an object lesson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , he is following a rather ambitious course of reading to prepare himself for a new responsibility he is anticipating in his business life . His problem is to work on his reading , for his enterprising family would absorb all his free evenings if he did not protect himself . How does he manage it ? Well , for example , at dinner one evening the older children suggested that he and their mother go to see a certain movie with them . He deeply appreciated their wanting him to join them ; at the same time he did want to get on with the book he was reading currently , for this evening his mind was fresh and he felt up to solid reading . " I 'll trade you tomorrow night or the next , " he told the youngsters . " I have a reading stint to do tonight . " // They looked up the film and found that it would be showing for the next two nights . So they decided definitely to go the next night . Thus his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasurable anticipation of going out with his family the following night . A New York lawyer who serves on eight boards of directors , and on special committees of several of them , as well as being on numerous civic committees , has a personal program which calls for a considerable portion of his time . His problem is also complicated by the fact that he must avoid conflicts in meeting dates of his various boards and committees . When a date is being set for any board or committee meeting , he takes out his vest-pocket engagement book . If the fifteenth of the month , say , has been suggested for the next meeting , and if that date either conflicts with another meeting or interferes with his personal plans , he never mentions the conflict but merely asks , " Would either the fourteenth , sixteenth , or eighteenth be as convenient for the rest of you ? " He reports that more often than not it develops that one of these dates is just as convenient . In fact , frequently other members volunteer that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surprising how often we can serve our own time-convenience , while satisfying our family or friends and meeting our business or professional obligations , by offering an alternate time . The world seems ready to accommodate itself to the person who schedules his time and insists ? albeit graciously and always with due regard for the convenience of others ? on carrying out his program . On the other hand , the easy-going person who readily changes his own plans to accommodate others often loses out on his own // plans , yet gets no particular credit for his easy acquiescence . Whenever the outside world attempts to divert us from our plans and purposes , we might well make it a habit to STOP , LOOK , and LISTEN to life : ? Stop and consider what the diversion will mean to us ; ? Look at the clock or the calendar and see if some other hour or day will not serve the others concerned quite as well ; ? Listen to the ticking of the Clock-of-Our-Lives , and realize that time is passing and we must use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our personal potentials . This last aspect of the problem of making personal progress suggests that every so often ? perhaps four times a year at the change of the seasons ? we might with profit push our lives off and take a fresh look at them , asking ourselves : Just what am I trying to get out of life ? Am I using my time and energy wisely ? Am I getting the satisfactions I seek ? Am I making the progress I should be making ? The chances are we will not be too happy about our answers to these questions . With the firmest intentions in the world , in the hurly-burly of daily living we tend to lose sight of our objectives . We permit ourselves to be short-changed in the matter of satisfactions , accomplishments , and progress by fitting too readily into other people 's demands on us . If we begin to challenge these demands , we will be surprised to discover what a fund of time and energy we will add to our precious store by resolutely sloughing off any activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This challenging process is as important as any habit we can // cultivate . Followed consistently ? but always with due consideration for the rights and interests of others ? it is perhaps the biggest single thing we can do toward making both the clock and energy forms of our time serve us to the full . TWO The Habit of Doing Important Things FIRST There is an even worse tyranny than that of the clock . It is the tyranny of convention in our use of our time . Unless we free ourselves from this tyranny we might just as well make up our minds that for us there definitely is neither time enough nor energy enough for the good life we would like to live . In fact , if we lack the gumption to boss the clock we are hardly entitled to a life of happiness , accomplishment , and progress . Why should we let other people 's conventional ideas of when we should do things , or how we should use our time , establish our habits of life or work ? The tyrant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a wrong start every morning . If we succumb we are likely to rob our day of a great deal of its time-value . The conventional approach of a housewife , for example , is to get her routine housework out of the way before she turns to any major project or indulges in any activity that would make the day very much worth living . The businessman 's conventional approach is to read his morning mail before he takes up the important business of the day . In both cases , the result is that the freshest hour or two of the 156 // day is consumed in routine activities , instead of with concerns which might mean much in accomplishment and progress . To get off to a fast start it is usually necessary to defy convention . A well-known woman writer once told me that for years she wasted at least two hours every morning before really getting down to work . " I could think of a dozen things I ought to do around the house first . The dishes had to be washed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sweep and dust . Then there was my shopping list to make up , and so on and on , before getting to my writing . At long last I was ready ? or almost ready . First I must sharpen all my lead pencils . Then there were likely to be two or three telephone calls I would decide to make before settling down to work . By then it would be mid-morning , and much of my steam would be used up . As a result of getting off to such a slow start , often I would have to work in the evening to meet my commitments . " One evening while working to make up for a particularly late morning start , I was called away from my desk in the middle of a paragraph . I did n't get back to finish it . Next morning I was so impatient to finish that paragraph that I went right from the breakfast table to my desk . Finishing the paragraph , I kept on writing , oblivious to the housework I was neglecting . First thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book that I had expected would take me the whole day ? and it was not yet noon ! " I was so pleased with myself that I breezed through my household chores , fixed myself a sandwich and a cup of tea for lunch , and at one o'clock was back at my desk . By five-thirty , when I called it a day , I had made a good start on another chapter . " My experience of the night before , in leaving off in the middle of a paragraph , had given me a clue . I did this again at the close of my workday , and again the next morning I found it easy to pick up where I had left off . Now I always leave off my writing // in the middle of a paragraph when I lay down my pencil for the day . Next morning I am eager to get at it , for nearly always I have thought how I want to finish the paragraph ? and start the next one . Once the ice is broken I keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my train of thought started . " I promptly tried this woman 's stopping-in-the-middle technique in my own writing and found that it worked . It is now standard practice with me ? but I usually stop in the middle of a sentence rather than a paragraph . This same technique can also be used effectively with other types of work . It is a natural tendency with most of us to try to finish any job we are working on before stopping for the day . Frequently this is the wise thing to do . But stopping short of completion , especially if we see just how to finish a job , often makes it easy to pick up the next morning . By the time we finish the uncompleted job we are in momentum and usually we take on the next job effortlessly , instead of having to resort to forced draft to build up a head of steam . Another aspect is that , when we leave a task short of completion , our subconscious minds continue to work on it overnight , and sometimes develop ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps even suggest improvements on the portion we have already completed . This is a technique that must be used with discretion ; but it is worth a test . But the mechanical aspect of stopping-in-the-middle is only half of the secret of the effectiveness of this woman author 's discovery . The other half is the resulting defiance of convention . Getting up from the breakfast table , after putting the cream and butter in the refrigerator , she goes right to her desk . The housework and telephoning have to wait until she has put in two or three hours at her desk . She tells me that often she gets as much writing done in these two or three fresh morning hours as she // used to get done in a whole day . Her mental energy ? to say nothing of her energy-of-the-spirit ? is so high that her mind is creative and eager to get to work . Many women could with profit adopt this technique of bossing their housework instead of letting it boss them . Why should any woman be a slave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and satisfying life ? Businessmen might well ask themselves the same question . The businessman 's morning mail was referred to earlier as commonly receiving his first consideration . Like the housewife 's dish-washing and bed-making , this is largely a matter of convention . A fiction story published several years ago dealt with a company president who gave orders that the morning mail was henceforth not to be distributed to the firm 's executives until one o'clock in the afternoon . The reason for this arbitrary action was the president 's conviction that , like himself , the other executives arrived at their offices in the morning fresh and full of plans for the day . But on their desks was their morning mail . It proceeded to take charge of them . In one executive 's mail there might be a letter complaining about a delayed shipment . He would let everything else wait while he started to trace down the trouble . By the time he had upset three other people and all but ruined the morning for them , as well as for himself , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to undertake the project he had planned for that morning . Another executive 's mail might contain a letter complimenting the firm on the fine job it had done in some special situation . I le would be so pleased that he would start down the executive corridor to share the letter with his associates . His intention would be excellent , but he would end by visiting with each of tliciu so long that their minds were taken off their own plans for // the morning . By the time he returned to his own office it would be too late to undertake any important project before lunch . Letters in the morning mail of other executives would interfere , for one reason or another , with their getting off to a fast start with special projects of their own . Too often they had lost their steam by the time they had taken care of their mail . " This organization is being bossed by the morning mail , " declared this president , " and it 's going to stop . " " Under his " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were distributed in the appropriate departments , all the executives faced the morning with nothing on their desks to prevent them from starting new undertakings while their minds were keen . When they returned from lunch the morning mail was on their desks to give them a fresh start for the afternoon . Seldom did any important matter suffer from the four-hour delay . There was still ample time to answer urgent letters that day , or to wire or telephone in emergency situations . While this story was pure fiction , the problem is deals with is real , and the pattern is almost universal in the business world . The conventional time to read the morning mail is first thing in the morning . Whereas the sensible time to read it would be after important projects of real consequence to the business had been well launched . The executive who devotes the fresh first hour in the morning to the most important project facing him is sure of a morning of progress . And he is likely to discover that the rest of his day is gratifyingly productive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic values in our , . own particular lives , and let other people live their lives as conventionally as they choose . We ought boldly to skip some of the routine things which , all our lives , we have been doing first thing // in the morning . It would be a wholesome exercise for each of us to challenge everything we now do during the first working hour of the day with the question : Is this sufficiently important for me to attend to first ? We should also study our temperaments and ask ourselves : Just what would get me off to the best start every morning ? A little experimenting would probably develop a surprising answer to this question . In his biography of Thomas A. Edison , C. B. Wall tells of the novel way " the Wizard of Menlo Park " started his day : " No matter how hard the driving pace of his working day , Edison never lost his relish for humor . During the war when he was working under the greatest pressure , he always asked to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roundup of the day 's best jokes then going the rounds in Washington and New York . Edison spread out the jokes and chortled over them before beginning the day 's work . Often , an associate recalls , his laugh was a roar you could hear all over the place " ' 1 Edison got his spirit " turning over " before he took on the day 's responsibilities . The trouble with many of us is that we are so conventionhound in our work-habits that we think we " have n't time " to start with the plan , project , or activity that would get us off to the fastest start for the day . Probably few human beings have ever carried a heavier load , or had so many demands on their time , than did President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. He sorely needed exercise in the fresh air to keep his body fit and his mind alert . But with the burdens of the Presidency , and the crowded calendar of callers he faced each morning , how could he possibly find the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved this problem by taking a brisk twenty-minute walk every morning before going to his White House Office . He knew that once he became involved in the routine of the day he would never be able to get away from his desk . So he took his walk first . This is the simple secret of making the greatest progress every day : to do the most important thing first . In all probability we will have to fly in the face of habit and convention . Why not ? We have but one life to live . Why should we let other people 's conventional ideas control our time and interfere with our progress ? If we take firm charge of our days , by insisting on doing the most important thing first , we will discover that other people will respect our time . They may think us a bit queer , but they will leave us alone in our queerness . A businessman who lets it be understood that he is available to associates and callers after ten o'clock , but not before , will soon find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lets it be known that , much as she loves her neighbors and friends , she is " not receiving " before ten in the morning will seldom be interrupted until after that hour . The head of a small but prosperous New York advertising agency has adopted the plan of spending his first hour behind closed doors . Before even glancing at his mail he concentrates on reviewing the advertising plans his associates have completed the day before . Since all plans must have his okay before being submitted to clients , he considers this his most important responsibility . So he puts it first . His secretary tells callers , " Mr. Brown will be in shortly after ten o'clock . " This lets them know when he will be available . Meanwhile they can use their own time to advantage . After all , why should any businessman let other people run- - and often all but ruin ? his day by following conventional office practices ? His success depends on what he can accomplish beEfficient // tween nine and five , not on how many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how many conferences he sits in , or how much correspondence he handles . The way to start is to start . The road to Mecca is strewn with the wrecked hopes of men and women who let the fresh hours of the morning slip by them only half-used . To do first what is most important makes sense as a pattern for working , as well as for living . We sometimes hear people say , " I 'm no good for the first hour or two in the morning . " This may be quite true ? but only because they have permitted themselves to form the habit of thinking so . To cure this habit , they have only to substitute the habit ? which will be mechanical at first ? of hopping out of bed in the morning , splashing their faces with cold water , and asking themselves briskly : " What is the most important thing for me to do first today ? " The man who recommended this method to me says he knows it to be effective because for years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really functioning until about eleven o'clock in the morning . In fact , he said he had rather prided himself on this idiosyncrasy . " One day , " he relates , " a friend asked me a brutal question : How can you respect yourself when you are throwing away the two best hours of the morning ? the two hours that give you a head start for the day ? ' That question brought me up short . I asked him how he started the day . He explained his hopping-outof-bed , cold-splash , brisk-question technique . I tried it , protestingly at first , but soon began to like getting off to a fast start . The result is that I usually have a fair day 's work done by eleven o'clock . Now I would n't trade the first two hours of the morning for any other four hours in the day . They are the golden hours . " There is another exceedingly important reason for getting off // to a fast start in the morning : so many things can happen by midmorning to upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions with respect to a plan or project that is important to us . Along comes an unexpected ? and often inescapable ? interruption which proves frustrating , if not downright irritating . The result is that we begin consuming the nervous-energy form of our time at such a rate that the accomplishment-value of our hours is greatly reduced . Sometimes the interruption is of such a character that it throws all our plans for the day out of joint . A major plan or project which we intended starting has to be postponed until next day , with the result that a whole day of progress is lost to us . We still must get up steam to tackle the project tomorrow . Yet tomorrow may be full of engagements and responsibilities which again prevent our making a start on the neglected plan or project . So it must be carried over to another tomorrow ? and perhaps another ? and another . Until we resolutely take charge of our days , and turn our backs firmly on habit and convention , we will not have mastered the first rudimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will we get the full benefit of the energy of our minds and spirits . And it is these forms of energy which enable us to tackle tough problems with vigor and confidence . They give us our drive . Hence the overwhelming importance of attacking the most important task first . The minute we say to ourselves , " I 'll just take care of this little chore first , " we are lost . For then we are sure to think of just one more little thing we ought to do first ? and one more ? and one more . To be effective ? to boss the clock as the clock must be bossed if we are to have all the time we need ? we must literally plunge into the activity that means the most to us in satisfaction , accomplishment , or progress . The cold-splash approach may not appeal to us as the way to get started ? fast . But all of us know ourselves well enough to // work out some specific for quick early-morning acceleration . If we make that a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of our days . This battle ? and it is a battle ? will have to be fought every morning until doing the most important thing first becomes second nature . Indeed , even after the habit is fairly well established , it will take all the " won't-power " we can muster to keep from backsliding . Starting the day fast is one of the most effective ways we can help ourselves to all the time we need . In doing so we are presenting ourselves with " the greatest gift in the world . " THREE To Master Those Dreaded Jobs It is safe to say that none of us escapes our quota of difficult or unpleasant jobs that we dread to tackle . We keep putting them off , seemingly in the vain hope that they will take care of themselves . The longer we procrastinate the bigger they loom , and the more we dread taking them on . But eventually we have to roll up our sleeves , literally or figuratively , and wade into them . Why put them off ? To develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of trying to hide from them , is to add hours and hours of time to our days and weeks , to say nothing of conserving ergs and ergs of our energy . The bigger the person , seemingly , the more of a problem this is . The reason is , of course , that big people face big tasks , many of them desperately difficult . There is no single specific for overcoming this human propensity . Sometimes we have literally to order ourselves to " get going . " At other times we must argue , lure , coax , or even trick ourselves into action . In exploring this area , I encountered a number of interesting techniques . A prominent business executive who seems never to put off his dreaded jobs confided to me that during half his business life he had struggled to overcome his " pushing-off " habit . 166 // " I could think of a dozen things that I ought to do first , though I knew perfectly well that none of them was really important . This constitutional antipathy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one evening I found at least a partial cure . While I was reading an absorbing biography my mind kept popping ideas . It occurred to me then that reading about other men 's struggles and achievements invariably stimulated my mind and spirit . " Why should n't I keep a biography in my office to dip into when I have trouble getting started on a dreaded job ? ' I asked myself . Next morning I took to my office the biography I was reading at the time ? and I 've kept one in a drawer of my desk ever since . Whenever I see one of these dreaded tasks looming on my horizon , and experience the telltale symptoms of rationalizing myself into thinking that some other time would be better , whatever time of day it is I close my office door and tell my secretary I will be out ' for a while , reach for my biography and start reading . By the end of a chapter I begin to experience a sense of stimulation . A second chapter nearly always puts me in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation for my own autobiography , and tell myself I 'd better get started on a fresh chapter . Whereupon I get going ! Seems silly for a grown man to have to resort to so mechanical a method of getting up steam , " he laughed , " but it works for me . " I told him I did n't think it silly at all , and admitted that for several years I have used an adaptation of this technique . Instead of a biography , my specific is The Reader 's Digest . I have found that picking up a copy of this little magazine and reading two or three articles gets my mental machinery turning over and produces a let-me-at-it reaction . One October day on a plane flight from Chicago to Boston , for example , I had an important report to write which I had dreaded for several days , and put aside to do on this plane trip because // I would be able to work without interruption . But my mind still balked . It was a sparkling morning and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape ! What to do about it ? That report simply had to be ready for a conference the first thing next morning . Suddenly I bethought myself of my little " Automatic Stimulator . " It happened that we were just landing at Cleveland . I hurried to the airport newsstand and bought a copy of The Reader 's Digest . After reading two brief articles and three or four episodes of " Life in These United States , " I closed the magazine , took out my pencil and was off to a flying start on my report . When the plane 's wheels touched the runway at Logan Airport , Boston , I was writing the final sentence . The explanation is , I believe , that this magazine gives me a sense of being out in the stream of life where men and women are doing interesting and important things . My mind begins to turn over rapidly . Ideas come easily . Having a sense of being in the stream of life is , I suspect , basically important to most of us in making progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , of being part of the times in which we are living , of playing a modest part in the Ultimate Scheme of Things . A brusque , seemingly hard-boiled corporation vice-president , with a reputation for wading into the toughest kind of assignments without the loss of an hour , attracted my attention . I asked him how he managed to boss himself so successfully . " I do n't boss myself , I get help , " he replied cryptically . " What kind of help ? " I asked . He looked at me as though not quite certain of my reaction , and then blurted rather self-consciously , " When I face a toughie ' I pray for the guts to tackle it , and then I plunge in. " // So prayer was his specific . And why not ? If we can get help from outside of ourselves , why should we not avail ourselves ? Another man who seems to do an excellent job of bossing himself with respect to put-off jobs confesses that he does n't boss himself ; he tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , " he says , " I stick a tentative toe into the cold water to get the feel of it . I wo n't actually take on this job just now , ' I assure myself , ' I ' 11 just make a few notes of what 's to be done when I do tackle it in earnest . ' Or , ' I ' 11 just get the tools out so I 'll be all ready . ' At least half the time this gets me so deeply interested that before I know it the job is done ! " Another time I assure myself that I 'll just do one little piece of some big job ? just to get it started . Only to find , several hours later , that I 'm pretty well along with it , and would n't stop for anything until it is finished ! " Another technique for getting started on a dreaded job is to make a few notes of what 's to be done . This gives us a perspective on the job facing us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " draw a mental circle around it " as a project . We visualize it as a " wrapped package . " Making notes also helps us to break the project down into small sub-projects , which are easier to start because we can see how to finish one of these in no time at all . This lures us almost painlessly into becoming involved . And one sub-project leads to another , until we find that we have made quite a bit of progress on the undertaking without realizing that we were any more than toying with it . We may even finish it , without quite realizing how we became involved in it . This tricking technique is intriguing ! By making a game of sneaking up on the toughest kind of jobs , we add zest to our days . // It is my experience that it works with all kinds of plans and projects , in our work , at home , and in community activities . To cultivate the habit of getting these bullying jobs behind us is to conserve mental energy which we might otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and years slip past us , and measure our progress against that of our most successful friends and associates , it becomes apparent that one of our most important concerns should be to develop the habit of coming to grips promptly with our dreaded jobs , for to do so helps to keep us in momentum . Losing momentum , whether in our work , our social or civic activities , or our household routine , usually results in using much more time to do something that could have been accomplished easily and quickly if done at the time it should have been . The energy-cost of losing momentum is prodigious . Every time we think of our put-off jobs , we consume a few more units of mental energy , which produces a sense of frustration that seriously reduces our over-all efficiency . Contrariwise , when we develop the habit of maintaining our momentum we enjoy a positive lift of mind and spirit . We seem to do the dreaded must-be-done things easily , and to have time for the outside things we want to do . We are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific that I often employ when I find myself approaching a job with an attitude of **46;179;TOOLONG . I remind myself of a certain Monday morning when , as a boy , I had been sent on an errand to a cobbler 's shop run by an old German , who was a philosopher as well as a cobbler . In his shop he had several machines , all of them connected by // belts to an overhead pulley-shaft which was constantly revolving . To start any machine he had to throw a lever which slipped its belt onto the already-revolving overhead pulley . The old man was putting on his leather apron when I entered his shop . " I feel like I was a thousand years old this morning , " he grumbled . " Seems as if I just could n't start another week 's work if I was to be hung for it . But do you know what ? " he continued , a broad smile spreading over his face , " Starting a new week is like starting up one of my machines . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moans for a few seconds , then the machine gets interested in its work and the belt begins to hum ! " With that he grabbed the lever that shifted the belt onto the pulley which drove the machine he was about to use . It behaved just as he had said ? it screeched for a minute , then moaned , then settled down to a businesslike hum . I have never forgotten that visit to the cobbler 's shop . Hundreds of times I have used the memory to create a work mood to tackle an unwanted chore . It will pay any person to make a special study of the kind of tasks he dreads and tends to put off . Then to study himself as a problem-in-activation . What personal specific can he develop that will quickly put him in a let-me-at-it mood ? Let him make a habit of using this specific and he will make much faster progress toward his Mecca . FOUR Develop a Faster Working Tempo Some of us could save a respectable percentage of the time we spend on our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While many of us are naturally fast and sure in our motions , more of us habitually dawdle away considerable time in carrying on the routine of our work . It was a woman who runs her home with exceptional efficiency who gave me a formula for cutting down the time devoted to routine tasks . " All you have to do , " she said , " is make your motions faster . This may sound like driving yourself . But I discovered years ago that it is not . Actually , we work more easily and use less energy when we do things at a brisk tempo . " She went on to explain that several years before , when her children were young , she had been bothered by the fact that when they asked her to do anything with them she was always having to tell them , " Mother does n't have time just now . Run along and play . " " One day it came to me that I never did have time for my children . I was always too busy doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children left for school , I sat down and held a conference with myself . Am I too fussy in my housekeeping ? ' I asked myself . Am I spending time doing unnecessary things ? 172 // Has my house become more important to me than my family ? ' Somehow I just could n't convince myself that I was wrong to keep my home neat and clean , or that I should start serving meals out of cans . And I could n't argue myself into thinking it was a mistake to set high standards of housekeeping for my two daughters . " But something is radically wrong with my housekeeping , ' I told myself . What is it ? ' Then it came to me : I am too slow in my motions . When I wash dishes I am unnecessarily deliberate in handling each dish . When I sweep or dust I do it not only thoroughly , which is desirable , but with almost languid movements of my hands and arms . When I make the beds I dawdle over spreading and tucking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were to do things just as thoroughly , but with much faster movements .. : I told myself . " I got up from my conference with myself and began my day 's work . Starting with gathering up the breakfast dishes , rinsing them and putting them in the dishwasher , I said to myself , Now , Marjorie , step up your work-tempo . You do n't need to drive yourself , but you know very well you can speed up your motions . ' " I did just that , and found myself saying , This is fun ! Why have I been dawdling all these years ? ' That morning I finished my housework in much less time than I had been taking . Yet I had n't shirked or slacked any part of it . " Before long I discovered that , though I was spending less time at it , my housekeeping had actually improved . When my eyes and mind worked ahead of my feet and hands , I dusted and swept more thoroughly , though actually using fewer minutes and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches because my eyes saw odds and ends of things that I could do on the wing , ' as it were . " I found that I did have more time for my children . And my husband began to notice that the dinner dishes were done faster and that I was readier to go places and do things with him in the evening . This , I discovered , was not only because I had more // free time , but because I felt less weary . For a while I did n't tell him my secret . When I did he remarked , Well that explains something that has had me puzzled . You are dressed and downstairs in the morning much quicker than you used to be . I had begun to think I was slowing down in my dressing ? but it 's you who have speeded up . ' " I have n't exactly speeded up , ' I said , but I have stepped up the tempo of my motions . ' Then I told him the whole story . When you step up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind begin to run ahead of your hands and feet . So every motion you make , and every step you take , is more efficient . For example , it used to take me two or three strokes to light a match . Now I strike it once ? and it lights . Or suppose I want to take down a vase from a shelf in the pantry . Instead of standing and looking up and trying to decide whether I can reach it , and stretching up to see , only to find that it is just too far back on the shelf , I pick up the step stool to start with , place it in exactly the right position , and reach the vase quickly and easily . Funny how much time it saves to do things exactly right the first time ! It makes you deft in all your motions . I guess the reason is because you know you are going to move faster , you think more sharply . ' " Well , ' said my husband . You 've sold me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try your stepped-up tempo in my own work . ' " He did . I made it my business to talk to him several months later , to find out whether he actually had been able to quicken the tempo of his office work . " Indeed I have , " he told me ? " and much more than I had anticipated . I found myself walking more briskly down the corridor when I arrived the first morning . I tackled the work on my desk with a new alertness of muscles and mind . I worked faster because I had to think faster to keep ahead of my motions . // Furthermore , I moved from one task to the next without skipping a beat , so to speak . A faster motion tempo produced a faster thinking tempo . " Actually , neither this man nor his wife had been dawdlers . But , like many of us , their working tempo was slower than it needed to be . We think of our working tempo as being controlled by our mental tempo . But perhaps just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds have to speed up to keep ahead of them . It is much like developing the habit of rapid reading . If we permit our minds to dwell on each word we are bound to be slow readers . Whereas , if we read by phrases , clauses , sentences , and paragraphs , our rate of mental absorption automatically increases . Not only that , but our mental processes are so sharpened that frequently we get more out of what we read . In the same way , moving a bit faster can stimulate us mentally so that we get our work done more swiftly and easily . It is not necessary to accelerate our motions to a point of developing a sense of rush or pressure . Many of us are lazymotioned without realizing it . We fail to focus sharply on what we are doing , and to train ourselves to weigh the value or importance of our motions in terms of what they are intended to accomplish . A quickening of our working tempo is likely to result in a new and stimulating sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of vitality . We will have developed a habit that will pay handsome dividends in the time and energy saved in the routine of our daily living . We may think of this as saving time ; actually it is a tremendously effective way to make time and store it for future use . FIVE Watch Your Mood - and Use It The mystery of mood has a great deal to do with the profitable use of our time all through life . Mood is apt to be a matter of energy : physical or mental , or energy-of-the-spirit ? often of all three . Since energy is a dimension of time , mood is most important to the effective use of our time . We should watch our mood constantly and take the fullest possible advantage of it when it is creative , constructive , confident , cooperative . When we are " in the mood " we can often do twice as much work in a given span of time . On such occasions , if at all possible , we will be wise to abandon our conventional routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal in a relatively short time . Men and women in every profession and business , as well as scientists and creative people , would accomplish far more with their time if they refused to be bossed by the clock or the calendar when in a mood for accomplishment . At such times they get their second wind and make phenomenal progress on projects that at a less favorable time would require much greater effort . The greatest creative writers , composers , and artists ignore meals and normal hours of sleep when they find themselves in a 176 // creative mood . They literally submerge themselves in their work as long as this creative mood lasts . On one occasion a well-known author worked almost continuously for three weeks . He ate only twice a day , and then at odd hours at his desk , and slept for only short intervals when he was completely overcome by fatigue . During this time his mail went unopened , and he scarcely saw his family . In these three weeks he wrote a short novel which would have taken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afterward he rewarded himself with a solid week of loafing , sleeping , playing golf , and going on excursions with his family , to give his mind a complete rest . He had abundantly earned this reward ! Few of us have either the need or the native capacity to work with such intense concentration over so long a period . But most of us could do better than we do at taking advantage of our propitious moods . There are times to watch the clock and live on schedule . There are other times to ignore the clock and junk conventional working and living habits in order to finish what we are doing ? while we are in the mood . . s The head of an advertising agency in a New England city was confined to his home for three days with an infection . The morning of the fourth day he awoke with a concept for an entirely new advertising theme for one of his agency 's most important clients . After breakfasting in bed he felt well enough to get up and go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes on the promising new theme his mind had conjured up . So , sitting in a comfortable chair in his dressing gown , he started to write . At noon when his lunch tray was brought to him he was still writing . He ended by staying home the rest of the week , writing , writing , writing . The mood was on him . The following Monday morning he arrived at his office with the complete campaign for an entire year , worked out in detail . Normally such a program would have taken the combined efforts // of a half dozen members of his organization , as well as his own . It would have involved numerous conferences , both within the agency and with the client , covering a period of weeks . But , because this man had been wise enough to capitalize on a creative mood , the whole process had been short-circuited . " That was an exceedingly profitable illness , " he smilingly told me . For two years a consulting engineer fought to make himself sleep between four and seven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself waking up about four o'clock popping with ideas . I would resolutely turn over and try to make myself go back to sleep . Usually without success . I would get up at seven with a feeling of having been awake most of the night . " One evening I read a book on the use of the subconscious mind in which the author made the point that a person would sometimes awaken at odd hours because his subconscious mind was ready to report on some project it had been working on while he slept . " That 's what is happening to me , ' I told myself . Since then I have n't tried to go back to sleep . Instead , I keep a pad and pencil on my bedside table and make notes of the ideas that come popping into my mind in the early morning hours . Usually after making the first note I wait a few minutes to see if there may not be another idea coming along , for I have discovered that ideas frequently come in pairs , and sometimes in litters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift back to sleep and do not wake up until the alarm goes off . In this way I have cured myself of my four-to-seven insomnia . Best of all , sometimes when I arrive at my office with my early-morning notes , the creative part of my day 's work is done ! " In my own experience , one of my most important ideas came // to me in a cryptic phrase at three-thirty in the morning in a Chicago hotel . I switched on the bedside light and jotted it down . As I started to turn off the light I had a sense that the idea might develop if I gave my conscious mind a chance . So I got up and put on my dressing gown and slippers and sat down with a pad and pencil . Sure enough , the idea began to expand into the details of a major project for one of my clients . For half an hour I wrote , perhaps more rapidly than I have ever written . Then my thoughts stopped abruptly . I went back to bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told myself that the idea I had found so stimulating in the night would probably turn out to be so much drivel by daylight . But it did not . Instead it proved to be a most successful venture . A helpful general rule is to do things when we feel like it , regardless of the hour , if at all possible . I have a friend who delights me in this respect . He is the manager of a department store in a New England city . I have known him to get up in the middle of the night , dress , drive down to the store and work out plans for a special sale event , returning home just in time for breakfast . He will have done perhaps two full days of conventional work in a few hours . In the morning he is far more refreshed in mind and spirit than he would have been from the same hours spent in restless sleep . Mood is usually associated with an individual 's characteristic way of working . An article devoted to Hans Hofmann , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point that each artist has his own way of working , some slow , some fast , some vehemently , some thoughtfully . The article goes on to say that Hofmann spends three times as long in preparing for a painting as he does in the work itself , and it quotes the artist : " I clean very nicely my palette . I wash hundreds of brushes . I keep the mind off myself . Then I work eight , ten , twelve hours // without interruption , without drinking or eating . I am usually done in one session . It does n't matter how long you take . What counts is the picture . " 1 Which is another way of saying that what counts is progress . o ? There is a special aspect of mood which deserves brief comment . Psychologists tell us that we have " mood cycles . " Some authorities claim that these cycles have a rhythm characteristic to each individual . In laymen language , this signifies that we have our up periods and our down periods , varying in length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creative , optimistic , productive . In our down periods we are low in these characteristics . It is hard for us to work . We accomplish little . Some people seem to have a weekly mood-rhythm . One of my business associates describes his weekly rhythm thus : " I start rather slowly on Monday morning and pick up during the day . By Tuesday morning I usually have a good head of steam , which carries me through Wednesday and Thursday . By Friday I begin to slow down . Saturday I am not much good . But my worst day is Sunday ! By Sunday afternoon the tide is out and the mud flats of my spirit are exposed . If I were called upon to make an important decision between noon and six o'clock Sunday evening , I would be aghast . My mind is completely out of focus and the world seems utterly unreal . Curiously enough , when the lights come on Sunday night the tide of my spirit starts to rise , my confidence begins to return , and I am on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about mood-cycles and their cause and periodicity . Meanwhile , we should be conscious of their reality and apply ourselves with double zeal during our up periods to accomplish whatever we are engaged in doing , and spend the down periods doing the routine things about our jobs which do not require imagination or inspiration . Thus we will con-
