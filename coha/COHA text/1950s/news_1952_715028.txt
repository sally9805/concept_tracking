txt With the Congress of Industrial Organizations torn over the choice of a successor to Philip Murray , strong sentiment developed yesterday for postponing the C. I. 0 . convention , scheduled ' to open in Los Angeles Monday . Mr. Murray 's sudden death of a heart attack in San Francisco Sunday touched off such internal strife over the selection of a new president that many C. I. 0 . leaders felt the only way to head off a serious tug of war was to defer the convention for at least a month . The official decision on whether to go ahead with the meeting of representatives of 4,000,000 industrial unionists will be made at sessions of the C. I. 0 . vice presidents and executive board in Pittsburgh tomorrow and Friday . If the top officials can reach agreement on a new C. I. 0 . head , the convention will be held , as scheduled . If they find no immediate way to patch up their differences , the convention will be postponed in the hope that time will help restore unity within the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mentioned The two principal contenders for the C. I. 0 . presidency are Allan S. Haywood , the organization 's executive vice president , and Walter P. Reuther , president of the milJion-member United Automobile Workers . However , the balance between their forces is so even that both may decide at the Pittsburgh meetings to throw their support behind a compromise candidate in the interest of harmony . If such a stalemate developed , the most likely choices would be Joseph Curran , president of the National Maritime Union , and Jacob S. Potofsky , president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America . Most C. I. 0 . officials avoided a public statement of their preference in advance of the meetings in the steel city , but Michael J. Quill , president of the Transport Workers Union and a C. I. 0 . vice president , put himself on record for Mr. Haywood . Quill Backs Haywood Mr. Quill said he believed Mr. Reuther had " his hands full " running the auto union . He added that Mr. Haywood was popular with all C. I. 0 . factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and represented a " logical choice " for president . The transport union head expressed hope that the convention would be postponed until April " out of respect for Mr. Murray " and that Mr. Haywood would be designated as " acting president " to carry on the organization 's administrative functions until the convention met . The seriousness with which post-I ponement of the convention was being considered became evident when it was learned that the C. I. 0 . had asked Atlantic City hotels whether they would be able to accommodate the 1,500 union delegates if the meeting were held Dec. 15 in that seaside resort . Mr. Reuther maintained silence about his own plans . He said he would have nothing to say publicly until after . Mr. Murray 's funeral in Pittsburgh Thursday . However , , Mr. Reuther called a meeting of his international executive board for today in Detroit , and it was considered certain that a decision on Mr. Reuther 's candidacy would be made at that time . In advance of the meeting , word circulated through the auto union that Mr. Reuther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unionists expressed confidence that Mr. Haywood would step aside in favor of Mr. Reuther and that no public battle would be fought . However , there was no indication among Haywood supporters that they intended to yield . Their strategy will be to try to compel Mr. Reuther to choose between assuming the C. I. 0 . presidency and continuing as head of the auto union . The Reuther group will argue that this is an unfair stipulation in view of the precedents set by the C. I. 0 . ' s two former presidents , John L. Lewis and Mr. Murray . Mr. Lewis , who founded the C. I. 0 . seventeen years ago , held the presidency of the United Mine Workers during the five years he spent at the C. I. 0 . helm . Mr. Murray divided his time between the C. I , 0 . and the United Steelworkers of America . The steel union is as large as the United Automobile Workers . Between them , the two organizations dominate the C. I. 0 . The steel workers are expected to throw their weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat , diminished by the fact that the steel union itself faces a fight for control . David J. , the union 's secretary-treasurer , has the inside track for the top job , but he may encounter opposition from James G. Thimmes , the union 's vice president , or from one of its district presidents . The leaders in this group are Joseph Germano of Chicago , Joseph P. Molony of Buffalo and James J. Thomas of Homestead , Pa . The dominant effort at this week 's meetings of the C. I. 0 . high command will be to hold the organization together . ' Major officials were fearful that any public conflict would expose the organization to " raiding " by American Federation of Labor unions and reduce its ability to cope with any difficulties it might run into from Congress or tile new Republican Administration ; C. I. 0 , leaders feel that no fruitful negotiations for organic unity with the A. F. L. can be held until they have set their own house in order . If the federation is convinced that the C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be inclined to make any concessions to it on issues of jurisdiction or future leadership , C. I. 0 . officials believe .
