The Communists ' new " relaxing " look made more news : Since Jan. i , when Premier Georgy Malenkov threw an unprecedented New Year 's party , tens of thousands of Moscow moppets have frolicked through the Kremlin , stuffing themselves with oranges and sweets provided by the Communist Party . Malenkov , along with other Soviet bosses , has made a point of stepping down from his fearful eminence to participate in precinct meetings of the party and the workers . He has been popping up in towns and villages all over European Russia to pump oldsters ' hands and wave at the muzhiks from his train . His puppets in satellite Hungary have revived old-style coffee shops , which under Stalin were banned as " reactionary , " and let American jazz ( Blue Tango , C'est Si Bon ) push Russian classical music off the radio . <P> In capitals from Oslo to Singapore , Russian envoys , suddenly polite , have been passing out caviar and cognac , lunching Western newsmen , offering to provide Soviet orchestras for their hosts ' enlightenment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market ( of 660 million Russians and Chinese ) for the surplus commodities of Western farms and factories . The Communists want cotton , wool , fats , steel and rubber and the payment they offer is attractive : gold , timber , even strategic materials . <P> What remains unchanged in all this is the size of Russia 's army and air force and the control of the secret police . The outward changes are all the kind that a regime under pressure , and needing time to consolidate its hold , could be expected to make .
