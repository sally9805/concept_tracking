In the grim years of cold war , a truly effective U.S. foreign policy is the work of decades . It is the sum total of crises met , of potential dangers recognized and countered , of national hopes and aspirations projected in hundreds of big and little policies . Success is measured in the sharpening ability to counter the probing actions before they become big offensives , in the growing frustration and confusion of the enemy , in the degree of popular will-to-win at home . Ultimate policy goal : to wrap up the political , economic , military and moral meanings of the U.S. into the sort of grand plan that the cause-human freedom-deserves and the objective - an orderly , peaceful world of prospering , responsible nations-demands . <P> In such long-range terms , 1958 could be reckoned a year of limited success . Still shocked at year 's beginning by Sputnik , the U.S. strengthened its steady recognition that crisis is the cold-war staple that must be lived with and lived up to . The 1958 record looked even better because of Communism 's failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. failed to define the grand plan-despite the stabs made by President Eisenhower , Vice President Nixon , Secretary of State Dulles , Dean Acheson , Adlai Stevenson , et al. - this failure was mitigated by the fact that , as the year closed , leaders of both parties were finally convinced that the definition was urgently necessary . <P> Specifically in 1958 the U.S. : <P> Determinedly and rapidly deployed military-diplomatic power across thousands of miles from Lebanon to Quemoy to Berlin ( see map ) , deterred big war and two limited wars , kept Communism locked up inside its empire . <P> Successfully countered Nikita Khrushchev 's year-long campaign to bluff , panic and cajole the allies into an empty summit meeting designed only to divide allies and get Western acceptance of Communist conquests . <P> Firmly endorsed and sometimes led the massive continental surge of U.S. allies in Europe through private-enterprise prosperity toward greater political-economic unity , symbolized by the six-nation European Common Market , which goes into effect this week . <P> Showed a sophisticated , no-comment restraint while De Gaulle turned France from cold-war weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Encouraged and supported the military regimes that came to power in South Asia and the Sudan , accepting them as a means of orderly growth toward democracy . <P> Tried , but failed , to channel the Middle East 's tides of chaos . <P> Gropingly attempted to define " new approaches " to growing nationalist movements in Asia , Africa and Latin America with new programs for the kind of economic trade-aid planning that had helped to save and inspire Western Europe . <P> The Precise Power . The U.S. 's holding of the free world 's defense lines made 1958 's most telling headlines . Architect of the defense was Secretary Dulles , who parceled out just enough U.S. power to keep the peace , but never more than enough . High points of crisis 1958 :
