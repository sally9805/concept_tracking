txt The Long Island Rail Road is embarking at once on a $6,000,000 program to install automatic speed control and cab signal devices on 52.6 miles of road , its most heavily traveled lines , in accordance with the directive of  --  the Interstate Commerce Commission . In his first interview since formally assuming office as sole*trustee of the bankrupt railroad , William H. Draper Jr . said also yesterday that two immediate safety measures already were in operation . Red-covered headlights , converted into rear warning lights that are visible a mile away , are in service on fifty-two cars , and the pick-up speed after a stop-and-proceed signal has been reduced from fifteen to twelve miles an hour . The I. C. C. last week gave the road thirty days in which to comply with its safety directives , issued after an investigation of the Thanksgiving Eve wreck at Richmond Hills , Queens , in which seventy-eight persons lost their lives . ' The train-control system is to be installed from the Harold Avenue tower in the Sunnyside yards to Hillside Avenue , just east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens , to Port Washington , and on the Montauk branch from Jamaica to Babylon . In addition " Harold to Hillside , " not now so equipped , will be provided with cab signals . Comparatively new but of proved effectiveness , the speed-control device automatically prevents a train entering a signal block occupied by another train from proceeding at more than twelve miles an hour . Mr. Draper said he agreed with the I. C. C. report that this installation would have minimized the loss of life in the road 's most recent disaster or averted it entirely . The cab signal device is one that registers a road signal in the engineer 's cab . Testimony at the several inquiries into the collision indicated strongly that ti engineer of the Babylon express , who was killed , had seen a go-ahead road signal . He had therefore picked up considerable speed in the belief that the preceding Hempstead local had cleared the signal , but the Hempstead train was unaccountably stalled . Mr. Draper made his announcements at his office in the Jamaica Station Office Building after conferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will submit to Judge Kennedy in a day or two , he said , a petition for the expenditure of $150,000 on the preparation of a design for the safety devices and for authority to work out a method of financing the safety installations . Funds for the cost of the design is available , Mr. Draper said . As for the $6,000,000 , Mr. Draper said : " I have every intention and am sure that we will find ways to raise the necessary funds . " Need for Fare Rise Hinted The detailed method of financing will be announced later , he said . Asked whether it would be necessary to raise fares , the trustee , without committing himself directly , implied that such a course might be warranted by the financial condition of the line . " In order to take the road out of bankruptcy and to install safety factors which I assume the public generally and the riders on the railroad desire , it will obviously be necessary to reduce expenses or increases revenue , " he declared . ? The trustee said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to see the railroad run on a private enterprise basis if that is feasible . " He said , however , that it would be presumptuous of him to pass on these . matters in advance of the reorganization plan , which , he pointed out , Governor Dewey has asked his Long Island Rail Road Commission to prepare by Feb. 1 . While first estimates of the time required for complete installation of the train control and cab signal devices , which function together , were between two and three years , Mr. Draper said " we intend to cut that time period down , and I hope materially . " Samuel B. Higginbottom , signal engineer , and Palmer S. Mock , superintendent of motive power , were leaving last night for Swissville , Pa. , where work will be begun today on the safety design at the Union Switch and Signal Company plant , Mr. Draper said . A. N. Williams , president of the concern , has given his assurances that the work will be expedited , he said . Mr. Draper announced formally the appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was superintendent of transportation for the New York City Transit System . The trustee said also David E. Smucker , resigned trustee and former operating head , had agreed to act as his consultant temporarily .
