" Wishie Weasel Head got mixed up with an old lady at Heart Butte , " read the item in the weekly Browning , Mont . Glacier Reporter ( circ. 1,200 ) . " So the old woman pick up a jug of Gallo and whack him over the head and was soaked in wine . He was hospitalized for several days so do n't bother an old lady . " <P> Over the last four years , Reporter readers have learned to expect such gamy fare from the paper 's correspondent in Heart Butte , a tiny Indian community ( pop . 250 ) hunkered in the hills of Montana 's vast Blackfeet Reservation . The Heart Butte correspondent , 65-year-old Weasel Necklace , never lets them down . Writing under his other name , John Tatsey , he produces a column so lively , if ungrammatical , that it is widely reprinted . Sample Tatseyisms : <P> " Old Uncle Frank was coming out of the Tribal Store with a bag of meat and bread when a young lady came and took the bag and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feed him . She walked so fast he could not keep up . " <P> " Levi Aims Back was picked up Sunday night back of George Wippert Place where he was hung up by one leg on a barbed wire fence . More fences would help the police . " <P> " Last week Chief Big Eagle went out one morning with two buckets after water . He never came back so one of his daughters went down to see what happened . The buckets were there but no Big Eagle . He was already in Valier he went after some thing stronger than whitetail water . " <P> Milo K. Fields , editor-publisher of the Glacier Reporter , used to worry that Tatsey 's pungent reporting might draw libel suits . He worries no more . Most of Tatsey 's neighbors-Mrs . Maggie Chief All Over , Francis B. ( for Bull ) Shoe , George Running Wolf Jr . and Sr.-complain only when they are ignored in his column . And the few who do mind Correspondent Tatsey 's frank exposures get nowhere with Weasel Necklace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just tell them what 's what , " says Columnist-Cop Tatsey . " And that 's all . "
