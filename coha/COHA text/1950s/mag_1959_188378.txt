Traditional diplomacy hardly stood a chance last week as the world 's two superpowers poked , prodded , and clutched at each other . <P> While Richard Nixon whistle-stopped his way through the vast expanse of Siberia , the world barely noted the foreign ministers ' conference grinding to an inconclusive end in Geneva . In Vienna , young Americans and Russians alike were learning some of the facts of international life at a rowdy , Red-run youth festival . And in their twin expositions-the Soviet in New York and the U.S. in Moscow-the superpowers sought with all the arts of salesmanship and propaganda to convince each other of their strength , wealth and contentment . <P> Asking Price . Traveling ballet troupes and mutual exchanges of praiseworthy banalities were , of course , getting to be old stuff . But the new turn in last week 's accumulation of events was the emergence of the Big Two as a conscious entity . To Nixon , as to previous U.S. visitors , Khrushchev voiced the opinion that world peace could be guaranteed if only the U.S. and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to give Nixon a chance to shine in Russia was a conscious effort to persuade the U.S. to bypass NATO , the Big Four and the U.N. , in favor of direct dealings with Moscow . Khrushchev had been almost indifferent-as well as rude-to British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . Now , in return for his welcome to Nixon , Nikita unabashedly hoped to get an invitation to the U.S. And judging from the sounds emerging from Washington-and from Nixon himself in Moscow ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , he was likely in due course to get it . <P> Already the Big Two were close enough to being a speaking-and-dealing reality that Western European diplomats were openly discussing it . " You do n't know General de Gaulle , " snapped a French government official , " if you think he is going to stand idly by and let Russia and the U.S. settle everything . " In Britain , the Economist surprisingly took the opposite tack . Ignoring the usual British argument that the West would be lost without the benefit of Britain 's deeper diplomatic savvy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the summit , " iaatly declared : " The job can be done better in Washington than anywhere else .
