The Wanton Troopers A Story by Max Steele Drawings by Johannes Troyer The wanton troopers , riding by , Have shot my fawn and it will die . ? Andrew Marvell B ETWEEN the Caf ? Mona and Saint-Germain-des-Pres , in the heart of the Latin Quarter , the Academie Andre is hidden away in a mossy courtyard behind huge and peeling dark green doors which open onto a tiny crippled street , which itself is almost hidden from the stranger who passes on the big boulevard or on the rue de Rennes . Here in the Academie , half the students are American , half are French . The Americans for the most part are veterans who report to class as though to work , put in their hours , and at the end of the month draw their subsistence and supply checks . The French are not so regimentalized and industrious . They wander in and out and the only ones who appear regularly and stay the entire day are the young girls who are inscribed here by their bourgeois parents in an effort to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sitting in the vestibule , peeling potatoes for her pot-au-fen or making innumerable checked aprons for her little grandson who plays all day in the cold courtyard or upstairs where some heat drifts through from the ateliers , Madame Helene watches these girls with rational , penetrating . eyes , just as she watches everything that transpires in the three huge studios of the Academie . She is a short , rather pudgy-looking woman of about fifty , and it is only when one sees her tiptoeing into a still-life class hugging a heavy granite bust of Victor Hugo that one realizes her quiet and powerful strength . There is a rumor that fifteen years ago she dragged a male model , awell-known Olympic athlete , out of the atelier , through the vestibule , and wrestled him across the courtyard before pushing him naked into the street . Madame Helene herself is always exasperated when asked about the incident . She throws her short arms toward heaven and explains in rapid French that indeed it did not happen thus . The man was posing in an old studio where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees she merely pushed him down the stairs , after which it was an easy matter to kick him into the courtyard , where he was allowed to dress . For certainly she had more respect and sentiment for the dignity of the Academie than to throw such a man into the street . After all , she concludes , is it not she who preserves the decorum of the school ? Is it not she who is the guardian of respectability ? Is it not she ( and then she goes off into a terrible argot which the Americans can not understand but which the French students explain with wicked delight ) who prevents orgies , of such total degradation that even Chicago would be shocked , from taking place in the ateliers and here in the vestibule and there on the stairs ? She grows voluble and specific and points to the courtyard and to various shrieking , protesting students while describing the horrible , intense debauchery which she alone , she , Madame Helene , for twenty-two years has prevented from being enacted here in this sacred Academie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her without understanding her words , it is impossible to know whether Madame Helene believes them or whether she merely raves for the entertainment of the French students and the bewilderment of the American . In any case , it is true that she can , without seeming to glance up from her potatoes , detect a flirtation and she often recognizes the delicate tendrils of love long before the persons concerned are aware of their own involvement . F oR several months last winter she regarded with attentive , impartial eye the coy behavior of Anna Barkova toward Nebraska Long . Nebraska was actually born in Iowa and his strong Midwestern accent had a slight Swedish lilt which rendered it less painful , even amusing to Madame Helene . But then Nebraska had early and accidentally rendered himself sweet to that woman by appearing impressed to learn that Claude Felix Cam bronne had studied and painted in this very Academie . ( At that time Nebraska , seated always mentally at the far end of the table from his august and chauvinistic landlady , was morbidly ashamed of his education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans usually did , or boldly as the French , just who exactly was this Claude Felix Cambronne . ) Later , after Christmas , when Madame Helene took him upstairs to her one-room living quarter and showed him a little oil study , 12 x /8 , that Cambronne had done of her , some thirty years before when she was a young girl with a plain but truly rapturous and innocent visage , he had had the presence to say that it was certainly a nice thing ; and then he had had the gallantry to say that he found her face more interesting now . That was . she said , indeed too charming of him . He had gazed closely at the portrait again and when he looked up at her aging face in the slanted light , they both had turned suddenly , unexpectedly red . She had opened the door and apologized for having taken up so much of his two-hour lunch time . Nebraska had gone quietly down the steps , across the courtyard and up the narrow street to Saint-Germain where he boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Saint-Germain was the fashionable farsbowg described by Proust . Now two wars , a dead husband , and three dead sons and two dead grandsons later , Madame had taken in this young man who wished so much , she explained his presence to visitors , to have the opportunity to live like a Frenchman , if only for a year . At the long mahogany table , where he often remembered the scrubbed-board kitchen table in Iowa and the muslin curtains , they talked lightly of politics , literature , and the ballet . That is to say , they talked of de Gaulle , Gide ( Sartre ' did not yet exist for them ) . and of Serge Lifar . When Nebraska mentioned Melville or any American writer or artist , Madame la Generale would lift her white eyebrows and demand whom with such a brilliant and icy smile that Nebraska was never sure whether it was his pronunciation or his taste which was being questioned . At such moments , by narrowing his eyes imperceptibly , he could make the candlelight seem to hesitate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black velvet choker-band about her neck would blend into the dark draperies behind her and Madame would be sitting with her head apparently severed completely from her body , guillotined by her own elegance . He sometimes dreaded these lunches but he remained here , he told himself , because he Iiked his tremendous room with the heavy dark red velvet hangings , the massive walnut furniture reflected in enormous , gilt-framed mirrors , and the lustrous parquet floor which squeaked so much like a well-chain . Here he stayed alone as much as possible and read American magazines and newspapers bought at Brentano 's on his book allowance . Each night he ate out , went afterward to the nearest concert , and stopped at the Cafe Mona to drink a cup of hot milk while listening without speaking to the difficult and often disagreeable Americans who drank there every night . A little after midnight he returned home to wash out his nylon shirt and shorts and once a week his blue jeans . It was a solitary life but one toward which all during the Army he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had called him in the army and again in the university , for he was by nature self-sufficient , happier when not having to think about other people . T HE fact that his notebook and pads were full , of sketches of Anna Barkova did not , therefore , mean that he had been thinking about her that winter . It was simply that he liked her odd assortment of features and found them so easy to reproduce that , left free , his hand was apt to trace automatically the dramatic sweep of her hair caught up in back , her querulous brows and short tilted nose , or her vulnerable , pouting baby mouth with its even row of white baby teeth . In all it was the soft , round face of a pampered baby ? except for the eyes which were tremendously large and dark and , even when she laughed , capable of sorrow . It was these startling , haunting eyes that confronted one from every page of Nebraska 's sketchbook . Madame Helene had , of course , become alert when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna heard of them she became immediately fascinated . When she finally confirmed , by the plain tactic of snatching his notebook from him , that it was true that the bony , balding Midwesterner was using her as a constant model , little Anna approached him each morning after that with a fondness and directness usually put aside for more subtle means by little girls after the age of four . She had absolutely none of the chic and poise one has been taught to expect of young ladies in Paris , and at almost twenty she was still involved in the baby fat that most young people have resolved at ten or twelve . Even when not interested in attracting anyone 's attention her actions were likely to be awkward with the outgrown spontaneity and enthusiasm of a child . During the fall term she had hung like a puppy at the heels of Bernard Levy and Suzanne as though it never occurred to her that that couple would want sometime to be alone . She never seemed to notice that they were never as overjoyed as she whcn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them coffee . Nebraska could not understand why she should want . to buy coffee for a person as physically dirty , uncombed , and rude as Bernard Levy who shouted continually at the models and at anyone who even accidentally touched him . He never shouted at Anna though and seemed to tolerate her and her extravagant emotions better than anyone else . HEN suddenly Anna turned this childish attentiveness on him , Nebraska was abashed , for at thirty he was still shy and wary of women , even the most gentle . He hurried through the vestibule now and took up each day a place between the model and the stove so that Anna could not sit beside him as she had done for several days after snatching his notebook . When he heard her from time to time tiptoeing playfully up behind him and peeping over his shoulder , he held his notebook unintentionally closer to himself . During the breaks between poses he rushed out into the narrow street where he smoked , and read and reread the stone plaque attached to the building across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France Gaston Raoult Etudiant Age 20 ans At this distance he could not read the engraved date on which the young student had died , and , even though he intended to , he never crossed over to see if the student had fallen , as most of them had according to the plaques scattered all over the city , during the fighting the . August of the Liberation . Soon Anna , watched by Madame Helene , began following him here to the street before the green doors . Becoming bold , ap-parently in the belief that he had come here to he followed , she playfully asked him for cigarettes ( which later he saw her giving to Suzanne and to the filthy Bernard Levy ) . Or she teased him by asking why he did not chew chewing gum like all Americans . He had told her it was because he was fifty-two years old and had false teeth . Even though he had said this to impress upon her the difference in their ages , this was just the sort of nonsense Anna loved and so each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . One day she said , more seriously : " Do you have a car ? " " Here in Paris ? " he asked . " Anywhere , " she said gravely . " At home , " he said . " A big car ? " " A Plymouth . " He was amused by her seriousness on the subject . " Is that a big car ? " He shrugged his shoulders in the new way . " Medium . " The next day she said : " Do you have a picture of it ? " " What ? " he asked , " Your car , stupid , " she said . " I do n't think so . " He grinned. - " Why ? " She was embarrassed but persisted , now as though it were a joke : " Search for one . " II E HAD laughed at her but that night he got out his footlocker and looked through his photographs . There was one of the farm taken from the silo , one of the clapboard frame house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the dusty road by the heat-blistered , peeling mailbox , one taken during the war of his mother in overalls and his Aunt Hilda in an apron , plucking chickens for the Saturday market in Watertown , one of himself on the new tractor , and several of the family and the new tractor , but none of the car . " Well then , " Anna said when he told her , " you must draw me a picture of it . " Nebraska 's first drawings had been of cars and planes and his first solution to the problem of foreshortening had been made one Sunday afternoon sitting by the mailbox trying to draw a car rounding the curve from Watertown . Somewhat ashamed , but secretly delighted , and more for his own pleasure than for hers , he began designing ridiculously elongated , low , streamlined automobiles . When he , as though by chance , let her see the folio which held them , he was disappointed in her reaction . " What is it ? " she asked as though greatly annoyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stupid , " she said . " Nobody has a car that looks like that . " She flipped the pages and looked at the fantastic cars . " No . " " You do n't like them . " " No , no , no . I want you to do a real car . Like you . have at home . " But she would keep these sketches until he did a sensible one . That evening , using a big sheet of paper , lie drew a caricature of a decrepit T-Model bouncing down a bumpy road , the rubbery wheels and axles buckling under it and throwing the driver , in a duster and goggles , a foot off the seat where the springs were crashing through the split cushions . She had laughed when he showed it to her but again she had protested and asked for a picture of his car , the Plymouth , a real picture . In the meantime she would keep the caricature if she might . T HE next morning the first truly spring sun was shining , so instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch-in a water color of the little green grocery shop at the corner by Saint-Julien-lePauvre . After lunch he went over to the Academie earlier than usual and while taking off his raincoat in the vestibule he could see Anna , Suzanne , and Bernard Levy sitting on the edge of the model-stand regarding his automobile sketches which were spread out on the floor . Several other French students were standing nearby looking and laughing . Feeling rather proud that they were amused by his drawings , Nebraska stood at the threshold of the open door ready to enter when he realized they were not laughing at the humor in his designs but rather at Bernard Levy who was delivering a lecture : " . . . voila l'art am  --  ricain . " It was too late for Nebraska to turn back . He entered the studio and walked along the side , back of the model-stand , to his shelf . The laughter ebbed away but Bernard , whether he had seen Nebraska or not , continued his mock lecture . " You will note the texture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally . And the pencil strokes . You will note that they were made with the finest pencils from Philadelphia . All bought by a government which can purchase anything , produce anything , including art . " Pretending that he did not understand the words  --  and all the students assumed that the Americans could understand only simple sentences spoken to them slowly and directly  --  Nebraska took down a set of water colors and some brushes and went quietly through the still-life room and back out into the courtyard . There his calmness left him and he began shaking all over . He should go back in and smash the boy in the face and kick the living hell out of him : Tear up the drawings . Confront Anna with her deceit . LL afternoon he was too furious to work . He walked along the Seine hating the sight even of it and of the bridges he usually loved to look at . He would never understand the French . Not if he lived here forever . Santayana had said that he had not a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marred by insincerity . Nebraska felt that they were probably sincere at any given moment but that they were completely the victims of their varying impulses . They had developed their elaborate rituals of politeness to hide this weakness . Anyway , one could not accuse Bernard Levy of being insincere , polished , politic . He was openly hostile to the Americans . He never spoke to them . Within their hearing , though , he accused them of being the new Germans , the new fascists , the new supermen , the lovers and rebuilders of a Germany that would again run riot over Europe . Usually , however , when he glared at them from his corner of the room or at their work , he was either silent or spoke in argot to the amusement of the other French . His chief argument against them seemed to be always that they had the best of supplies , five thousand francs ' worth a month , paid for by their government , while he , though he did not mention it , often drew with a black crayon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other newspapers , had few photographs to interfere with his compositions . " But it 's not fair , " Nebraska thought . " There 's not an American there who would n't give him papers and pencils and brushes . If he were n't too damned proud to accept them . " It was true : almost any one of the veterans was pleased when he could find a tactful way to let one of the more talented of the French students have supplies on his bill , if not as an outright gift then in trade for a small composition . All of the Americans wanted especially to own at least one of the journals on which , using a bamboo stick dipped in India ink , Bernard drew literally hundreds of hollow-eyed , skull faces with gaunt bodies . Sometimes these strange birdlike figures were naked and their ribs and hipbones and thighs were depicted with the terrible accuracy of an anatomical chart . Sometimes they wore hanging , gauzelike clothes and carried shovels that seemed to be as heavy for them as railroad ties . Whether clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despair and hopelessness. - He worked with a maddening intensity and for weeks he would never look at the model , at whom he nevertheless shouted abuse , but would stand in the back of the room working as though he had a hundred years of work to do in one , drawing and redrawing these haunted , nightmare , wraithlike creatures . At other times but- with the same furious intensity , lie would draw on gray paper quite marvelous gulls in graceful , lyrical flight . As much as Nebraska , at the moment , despised the boy , he would have given without hesitation his next month 's supply allowance for one page of one of the decorated newspapers . " But it 's not fair what he says , " Nebraska said again . He thought of Benito Marino from New York who had had three excellent shows and whose work was as good as anyone 's at the school , including perhaps Bernard 's . And Silvers who had even a better eye , yet with not as much taste . But then look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were caught up in the resurgent Lautre. : vogue to the extent of actually putting long black gloves on their paintings of the nude models ! Even as his fury subsided he knew he could not go back to work at the Academic for a great many days . F ORTUNATELY the next week was warm for early April , bright and without rain . Nebraska finished his water color of the green grocery and the following week had begun another , near Buci , when the weather broke gray and wet and cold as winter . Reluctantly he returned to the Academie which . he had not been able to force himself to think about . He arrived during the eleven o'clock break , just as a few of the students were wining across the courtyard . He glanced quickly to see if Anna were among them . He had decided it was not deceit but childishness , perhaps even pride , which had prompted her to show her friends the automobiles . In any case , he would continue as far as possible not to have any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , Ma- dame Helene seized upon him with a false gaiety that made him want to leave . Had she heard about the mock lecture ? She , however , was so full of enthusiasm over his appearance ( the sun had tanned his bald brow ) and over his work outside that he could not discern the direction of her thoughts . She led him away from the ateliers to the foot of the stairs , still talking volubly and louder than usual . Suddenly she stopped , turned and faced him directly and said in a low voice , almost a whisper : " The little Anna , she should not be alone . Ask her to take a cup of coffee with you . That would be very nice of you . " Again he wanted to escape . Were the two women conspiring to force him out of his solitude ? " You know , of course , about her friends , Suzanne and Bernard ? " " No , " he said . " Bernard killed himself . It has been eight days now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Little Anna is alone and naturally quite sad ! " Madame Helene dug into the square pocket of her black smock and asked : " Do you have money for two coffees ? " She pulled out a handkerchief and wiped her nose : He said without moving that he did and that it would be nice if Madame Helene would join them but she protested that she must finish dinner and find a way of digging out a twenty-franc piece for the little grandson who had stuck it into the window sill . He would find Anna in the still-life room . Without taking off his rain coat , Nebraska walked through and put away his water colors and brushes on the shelf from which two weeks before he had taken them . The atelierwas empty .. now and without sound . He , walked through to the . still-life room . in the center , her back toward him , the plump curve of her cheeks showing beyond the small ears , Anna sat gazing at a squash and two eggs . She turned when she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " Look , " she said , holding out her sketch pad . " It 's lurid no matter what angle you draw from . " They regarded the studies and laughed . He was surprised , after Madame Helene 's speech , to find her so cheerful and apparently unchanged . Certainly she would love a cup of coffee  --  if he had any money , she did n't . They pretended to fight over who should open the door and once across the courtyard who should open the big green doors to the street . Finally , because she had opened the first , she consented to his opening the second . In the street she said : " You must let me walk on the outside . Next the street . " He explained that in America young ladies walk on the inside toward the buildings . " America , bah ! " . she said but in a good humor . " Besides it 's silly to have such a rule . " " It 's because the Elizabethan houses hung over the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit with refuse thrown from above , " he explained . " Then too , because the horses splashed mud . " " And here the man gives the woman his left arm , to have her near his heart and to leave his sword hand free to draw and protect her . " " In any case , " he said , " you 're on the wrong side . " " Do you mind ? " she asked gravely . She was walking on the curb stones like a child , balancing , and stepping down occasionally when she could not maintain her balance . " I do n't like for people to get between me and the curb . " No , he did n't mind . He was delighted that the conversation was so trivial . During the coffee and the walk back they did not mention Bernard Levy and the fact that he had killed himself . T N THE weeks that followed , the classes went on as before , and if many of the students knew about the suicide no one mentioned it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy weather or on cold days the ateliers were full again . Now in the spring no one could take the work seriously and even the models seemed restless and more bored than usual . Nebraska no longer tried to avoid Anna , who still followed him about like a shy child following a department-store Santa Claus . Whether from fear of her or of himself he did not know , but he did not want to be alone with her . For that reason he never stood now , during the breaks , at the door of the Academie from which he could see the plaque with the engraved legend of the fallen student . Anna , though , seemed quite satisfied merely to sit next to him and draw from the same model and to tease him when his perspective was off . They were sitting thus , side by side , one cold morning in late May . The fire was popping in the potbelly stove and rain was dropping heavily on the skylight . The model before them was a handsome lad with strong nose and cheekbones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined his prominent jawbone and chin . It was a good face to draw , easy to catch a likeness of , and excellent for oils . Students had crowded in from the next room where the fat Negro woman they had drawn all winter was stretched out in a comfortable but impossible pose . Everyone was working and there was only the sound of the fire , the rain , and of the charcoal scraping on paper and canvas . Suddenly the model , who had not twitched a muscle , deliberately turned his head . " Ich babe keine Uhr , " he said in a deep German voice . " Urn welche Zeit gehen Sie fort ? " y OR a moment the room was silent . Then regaining his pose he asked in good Swiss French what time it was , that he was probably the only Swiss person in the world who did not have at least one watch . Several people told him the time and the pencils again sounded on the tightly stretched canvases . Nebraska himself was measuring the distance from the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corner of his eye Anna lean forward as though with a stomach . cramp . He watched her hide her face in her hands to - try to conceal that she was shuddering . " Anna ! " he said softly . She shook her heacL He waited a moment , his fingertips still poised against his canvas . Anna without standing completely up made her way between the stools and easels . When he reached her in the still-life room she was still shaking and the tears in her eyes were held back only by the long lashes . " What is it ? " he asked in English , then in French . She shook her head from side to side . " Rien . Rien . Nothing . " She tried to move away . He pocketed his pencil . " Let 's go get some coffee . " She nodded and walked ahead of him to the vestibule where they put on their coats . Madame Helene seemed to be not at all aware of their presence or departure , but when Nebraska turned to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not with encouragement or approval , then certainly with understanding . He did not ask Anna again what the matter was . She walked ahead of him , on the curbstones , and when she had to step down into the street she turned and tried to smile . " I am so silly , " she said as though talking about her lack of physical balance . But she continued , first in English which suddenly deserted her and then in French : " If I know the person is a German or I know he is going to speak German , then I 'm all right and it does n't bother me . It 's when someone speaks it suddenly , when I do not expect it , that is what makes me tremble all over . " " What are you talking about ? " He honestly did n't know . " The model . " Nebraska realized then that the model had asked a question in German . " But he 's Swiss ! " Anna shook her head . " It 's silly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I had been sitting there so close to him , studying him so carefully . Not even suspecting that he was sitting there thinking in German ! " I N " ri-iE dark little cafe they sat quietly for a long while , until finally she was no longer trembling and could look at him again without - embarrassment . " It . always makes me think of the night in 1942 when they were rounding up all the Jews . My father had already been sent away and my mother was working in the hospital . In the middle of ? the night a neighbor from downstairs who had a key to our door woke my little sister and me . ' Hurry , ' she said , ' they are here . ' My sister and I climbed out onto a roof through a toilet window and when they went upstairs to get us , the woman 's husband helped us climb down into the alley . " Nebraska drew designs in the spilled coffee on the table and asked without looking up : " How old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister five . It was July , but it was a cold night . They had been afraid to be out in the dark streets and they were afraid to go to any of their friends ' houses because they had been told not ever to say where they lived or where any of their friends lived if the Germans ever asked . They had run by back streets down to the Seine and all night they had walked along the embankments below the street on which the Nazi patrols were cruising . When the cars passed , they hid under bridges and for a while they had slept under Pont Alexandre Hi At dawn they were on the Ile Saint-Louis and there was a man in a white trench coat looking down the steps to the river . They were almost to the top of the steps , intending to ask his help , when he suddenly spoke , evidently to another man , in a urinoir set into the quai . He had used almost those same words the model had : " Urn welche Zeit gehen Sie fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and down the rue Saint-Louis . When they looked back the man was coming toward them , fast . She had not cried and her sister had not but they knew they were caught . Then suddenly an old , old woman with two huge baskets , who must have been watching them , stepped out of a doorway and screamed : " Ah there you are , you lazy idiots . What do you mean hiding from me ? Here take this basket . " And as though they were going over to buy some coal they had , the three of them , walked away from the confused German . " Thirty thousand Jews were caught that week and packed into the Palais de Sport on Grenelle . That was when Bernard and his family were taken . " " Ah , you knew Bernard before the war ? " " He was the only one who was left . Out of all my schoolmates , he was the only one still alive . " She spoke quite matter of factly . " You knew he killed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look up . " I was sorry to hear . " She was evidently not convinced or concerned . " Nobody cared . Nobody understood him . Not even me or Suzanne . Suzanne least of all . " " Does anybody know why ? " " He had a cake of soap , you know . " With a real effort Nebraska prevented himself from saying : " But he did n't use it . " Instead he raised his eyebrows to question . " His entire family was taken the same night we got away . They were shipped from the Palais de Sport to concentration camps . His two sisters were sent out in one group , Bernard and the rest of his family in another . He and his mother and father were shipped to the same concentration camp . Bernard was working there in the soap factory and he knew the day his parents were killed so he saved a bar of the soap they were in . We tried to make him throw it away but he would n't . He kept it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Suzanne found him dead . " D ! HUNG the long silence , when the only sound was from distant taxi horns , Nebraska absently traced with the coffee a little two-wheeled toy car on the table . Anna twisted her head to see it better . " That 's for children ! " she complained . " The kind you pedal . " " Yes , " he said , still not looking at her . When he did look up she was laughing . " Do you know why I like to walk on the curb ? " she asked . Her moods seemed to him to change as fast as those of a child and certainly her mind darted childlike from subject to subject . " Before they carried my father away , my tittle sister and I used sometimes to be very frightened . We were so silly . We did n't know what of , but . we would cry . Then he would take us in his arms and the three of us would sit together in a big chair and he would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great big car would stop and we would get in and we would travel and travel and then we would be in America and there would be plenty of everything to eat and plenty of coal to burn to keep warm . So after that my little sister and I always walked on the curb one behind the other so we could jump into the car when it stopped . " Nebraska considered for a long time before he spoke and when he did his heart stopped beating and choked in his throat . " Would you like to go to America ? " It was a simple question , but from the solemnity of his tone and the sudden agitation of his entire body , they both knew what he was asking and the commitment he was making . F OR a moment she looked frightened and uncertain whether to speak or not . Finally , deliberately casual , she asked : " What will you do there ? " " I 'll probably teach art in some small Mid , western college . " " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply preoccupied and did not seem to know what she was saying . If Nebraska had looked closely he might have recognized that her lips were trying to say yes she would like to go to America but that her sad eyes and querulous brow were asking : " Me ? Anna ? Grown ? Going to America ? Married ? " She had had to dream , as a child dreams , too long to grow up suddenly into a real world where love and food and warmth were possible . Her face turned furious in the effort to speak but she could say nothing . " That 's true . I know nothing about art . " He was breathing now , momentarily relieved that she had not answered his proposal immediately and without contemplation . Until this hour he had not admitted , even to himself , how close he felt toward her , and it would take time to give up entirely all his fears and suspicions of women . He hoped she would give him a few days before saying definitely that she would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his words : " Perhaps though I can teach them one thing I 've learned here and that 's a sensible attitude toward art . And maybe I can create , even in just one room , a place where one need n't be embarrassed by talking about painting and by taking it  --  as , forte instance , Bernard did  --  as a serious part of living . It would have meant a great deal to me when I was growing up to have had such a Pace . " " Bernard did take it . seriously , " Anna said . " He used to sit in here by the hour reading newspapers . Whenever he found anything about rebuilding Germany or about what he called fascist-tactics in America , he would put it aside and plan for weeks the faces he was going to draw on it . " " I thought he drew on newspapers because he did n't have money enough for paper . " " Money ! " Anna said the word evidently louder than she had intended , for she leaned over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think that 's what produces art . You ca n't separate money from art , and money from morality , and money from politics . That 's what 's wrong with all of you Americans . But you can separate morality from politics and art from both . Art in one isolated room , indeed ! " The words , which were obviously Bernard Levy 's , sounded ridiculous in Anna 's childish voice , but the reference to the isolated room which Nebraska had mentioned in a moment of sentimentality was her own , and the sarcastic tone was her own , and to these Nebraska ? listened with his old wariness of women . Then had she been playing with him merely to laugh at him ? Defeat froze slowly over his eyes which stared without blinking . " Let her laugh , " he thought and seemed surprised when she did not . T HE silence which separated them now was deep and for five minutes they sat without speaking , each in his own inalterable world .
