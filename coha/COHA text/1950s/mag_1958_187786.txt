Golf pros may blow easy putts , a tennis champ double faults , and it is only reasonable to expect on occasion a painter will turn out a turkey , even as great a painter as Rembrandt . But with all due allowances for human frailty , Rembrandt 's early St. Bartholomew has long made Rembrandt scholars uneasy . Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum labeled the painting " attributed to Rembrandt " when it was received as a bequest , later returned it to the donor 's estate . This week the Worcester ( Mass . ) Art Museum unveiled a new acquisition that unmasks the mystery : a new version of St. Bartholomew , which is clearly the original , demoting the other to the status of an uninspired copy by one of Rembrandt 's followers . <P> The copy , formerly in the Manhattan collection of Michael Friedsam , had been " authenticated " by scholars and repeatedly exhibited as genuine . For years the original was tucked out of sight at Dumbarton Oaks , Robert Woods Bliss 's mansion in Washington , D.C. But after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Harvard 's Jakob Rosenberg , topflight Rembrandt scholar . " A comparison of the two heads shows at once how much of the plastic quality is lost in the copy by a manipulation of the brush that imitates Rembrandt 's strokes but loses control of their modeling function , " wrote Rosenberg . " The transitional tones , so essential for bringing out the modeling in its full range , are gone , and the face has become much flatter in detail and harsher in its value contrasts . " <P> St. Bartholomew , one of the more obscure of the apostles , is also subject to historical confusion . The symbolic knife he holds derives from the story that he was flayed alive in Armenia . Out of ignorance of this tradition , one of Rembrandt 's own later versions now in Downton Castle , near Ludlow , England , was long titled Rembrandt 's Cook . <P> Rembrandt supposedly used not his cook but his father as a model , and the Worcester Art Museum 's Bartholomew provides dramatic evidence that even at 26 , Rembrandt was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his late great style . Says Worcester Museum Director Daniel Catton Rich : " St. Bartholomew was done just before Rembrandt entered into his early success in Amsterdam and began to turn out rather slick , social portraits . Its deep , inner power foretells the late , introspective Rembrandts-an interesting link between his youth and old age when he painted some of his greatest works . "
