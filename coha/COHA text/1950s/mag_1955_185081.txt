No Time for Sergeants ( adapted by Ira Levin from the novel by Mac Hyman ) offers a really good evening of simple-minded fun . Less a play than an episodic romp , it tells of Will Stockdale , an incorrigibly good-natured young hillbilly who is inducted into the U.S. Air Force . Will puts his foot in his mouth as nonchalantly as though it were his pipe ; he triumphs over every crisis by never knowing he is in one ; he stands the Air Force on its ear by looking everyone guilelessly in the eye . So backwoods as not to know that a sergeant is a recruit 's natural enemy , Will all but kills his own sergeant with kindness . He all but gives the Air Force psychiatrist ulcers through his unshatterable normality . In time he sets forth with one of the zaniest of crews on one of the most demented of flights . Only after that - and perhaps only by comparison-does the play itself seem earthbound . <P> No Time for Sergeants follows a classic pattern of rube-conquers-all , but it follows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just the simpleton who confounds the sages ; he is also the good boy who can lick all the bad ones , the farm boy who can drink city slickers under the table . With everything soundly proceeding at a comic-strip level , No Time for Sergeants becomes a fine , boisterous exercise in sustained improbability , in morning-fresh outrageousness . It has a kind of healthy , folkish madness : it makes the Air Force seem like something personally invented rather than anything ever experienced or observed ; it makes sex-on the rare occasions it refers to it-seem rather like a good breakfast food . As Will , Andy Griffith has enormous lumpish charm ; Roddy McDowall is just the right foil as his buddy , Myron McCormick an amusing , long-suffering sergeant . Peter Larkin 's attractive sets are often amazing bits of engineering , and Director Morton Da Costa has polished the show to precisely the right roughness . <P> A Roomful of Roses ( by Edith Sommer ) is this season 's entry concerning the child of divorced parents . The 15-year-old girl comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man . She comes arrogantly , with her chin set and her lips cold . As her mother , stepfather and some neighborhood young people do everything they can to thaw Bridget out and win her over , it becomes plain that she not only resents her mother . Her relations with her father are also twisted , her whole life is lonely and askew , her disdains are defensive , her withdrawals constitute flight . What she needs , of course , is love , and there is no lack of it at curtainfall . <P> A Roomful of Roses nowhere skimps Bridget 's plight , but it far from gloomily dwells on it . However valid , Bridget 's seems a matinee or televised grief . And Playwright Sommer wants to have her ache and eat it , too . She stirs into the play a full cup of adolescent humor , a level teaspoonful of small-boy remarks , a lightly beaten offstage comedy husband and the juice of one uninhibited maid .                @ @ @ @ @
