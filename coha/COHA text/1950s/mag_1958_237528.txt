" Trying to anticipate any theater season , " said a critic , " is like wiping off the lipstick before you 've kissed the girl . " Last week the girl was getting ready to be kissed . Trying out on the road before the hoped-for move to Broadway , new shows were primping frantically amid the desperate attentions of play doctors , angels , producers and producers ' wives . <P> Goldilocks , a musical visit to the Cro-Magnon days of moviemaking , was singing just a bit off key in Philadelphia , and its authors , Critic Walter Kerr and his wife Jean ( Please Do n't Eat the Daisies ) , were working overtime to tune it up . At the Grand , the musical version of Vicki Baum 's Grand Hotel that is scheduled to take Paul Muni back to his beginnings as a vaudeville hoofer , is laid up in California while its producers try to produce a new book . Other shows were more nearly ready to kiss the road goodbye : <P> HOWIE , by Phoebe Ephron , moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiz show scandals . Howie ( Albert Salmi ) is a hulking ex-deck ape , the kind of guy who knows everything except when to shut up . He finishes his mother-in-law 's Double-Crostic , his father-in-law 's sentences and the neighbors ' bridge bids-in short , the perfect quiz contestant . But when his sister-in-law ( Patricia Bosworth ) helps con him into going on a quiz show , he refuses $96,000 after he discovers that his opponent has got a fast shuffle . All this drew exactly 262 laughs one evening in Boston . Until curtain time in New York this week , where Howie opens the season , all hands were working on a new third act . <P> A TOUCH OF THE POET is the only extant play ( the author tore up the others ) of that final series in which Eugene O'Neill meant to spell out the dark , brooding mysteries of the human tragedy . <P> <P> Britain 's Eric Portman is excellent as Cornelius Melody , a vainglorious Irishman who has quit the auld sod , risen to glory in Wellington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace as a shabby saloon keep in the Boston of the 1820 's . Helen Hayes survives her own saccharine whimsy as the harassed biddy married to a ruined cavalier , and Kim Stanley is impressive in the role of the old man 's pride-ridden daughter . New Haven critics and audiences were divided , but " Con " Melody 's brogue should still make one of the richest voices on Broadway .
