Maraela to comfort me , and then her image was before me , banishingthe gloom of that hateful place , of that hateful hour . C H A P T E R 4ENJAMIN MARINO WAS TIDE GREATEST MAN EVER TO CROSS my path , and this encompassing declaration includes Christopher Columbus , whose standard I followed into the Unknown , and Martin Alonso Pinzon , whose caravel I helped sail on the voyage that ended the Age of Darkness. 0 God , the Clement , the Merciful : how well I remember ! 0 Mita , my beloved , that hour I can never forget . The college assembled at six o'clock on Monday morning for the Marino lecture and , after prayers , the friars counseled their students to attention and we sat erect on the benches until the sun brushed the last shadows from the room , and then Benjamin Marino entered . He had no books , no charts , but only himself ; a slight man of infinite patience , and proudly wearing the beard of David and a brown doublet loosely woven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan cuffed his cheek with an open palm . Teacher Marino went straight to the podium and there , to the witnessof all , he bowed his head in the supplication of Judah , then lifted his eyes to us , and his eyes were brighter than the flames of old Quemadero . " Friars Preachers and young Sirs . " His voice rang the salutation . " By your gracious leave , I will borrow your minds and the interest thereon will be knowledge of things mundane and not godly , if any man can separate the world from the God who willed it . Seek ye the truth ! " The words sang like the wind in sails full-blown and my heart swelled with a new yearning , and suddenly nothing else was important ; not my father , neither Maraela , but only this man whose eyes burned bright . " Mundi f ormam ornnes fere consentiunt rotundam esse . " His Latin was immaculate and he was quoting the pronouncement of Sylvius Piccolomini , who , as a writer , had given us The Story of Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , had given us the dictum : " Virtually everyone is agreed that the world is round . " Teacher Marino gave the words free flight , watching our faces , and seemingly mine more than all the others , and then he gripped the edges of the podium and spoke again . " Yes ! The world is round . The Prophet Esdras was right . God 's earth is a sphere . And , yet , Esdras was wrong . " It was a bold thing to say to the Dominicans , who espoused the teachings of that ancient messenger . I glanced at Fray Juan and his jaw was still and his eyes were fastened on Benjamin Marino , the meek Jewish schoolmaster who was daring to contradict Esdras , the Jewish prophet . " This great man of my people , this Esdras of your sacred books , held that the world is only one-seventh water . That is his error . The world is larger than you believe , for the sin of this age is man 's conviction that he alone is master and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sin . It is stupidity . " Here again was dangerous ground , but he trod it underfoot , undauntedand unafraid , and the college was as hushed as the blue distance of Andalusia 's sky . " We are gnats and the earth is larger than you think . The seas are deeper . The seas are wider . The skies are higher . The world is older than you say and will live longer than you teach . " We journey east to India . Then is India also west ? " He leaned forward and his ardor held us transfixed . " Yes . India is east , and India is west . But how far ? " Teacher Marino straightened and smiled for the first time . " Answer that conundrum and Spain will hold the world in her palm . " He rubbed the back of his neck , staring up at the arched ceiling as though awaiting the Word , and then resumed his lecture , speaking slowly in Latin and only rarely in Spanish to strengthen a point . " The cartographers and astronomers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold that land is only 700 leagues to the west of the Canary Isles . They dispute among themselves as to whether that land is India . I say it is not . " He stressed the negative , rapping the stand to emphasize his point . " The illustrious Florentine , Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli , has prepareda map for the Portuguese Crown . Colleague Toscanelli is an excellent physicist , but a naive cartographer . He places Asia 8,000 miles to the west . " His smile was wan and he covered it quickly by rubbing his chin and his mouth . " The earth is larger than Toscanelli thinks. 41 " Hence , we have two schools . Salamanca says unknown land is 700 leagues west , or roughly 3,000 miles . Toscanelli says Asia is due west . " He lowered his voice and prepared us for the calculated thrust that we knew was coming . " They both are right ! " There is land in the Ocean Sea . Terra incognita . Perhaps the Atlantis of Plato 's vision . Or --  " And he hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Cities . " I heard Fray Juan gasp his incredulity and the other Dominicans scowled their disapproval of myth-teaching , but Benjamin Marino was not perturbed . " Do not scorn the stubborn tradition that , more than seven hundred years ago when the Moors expelled Spaniards from Spain , your breed followed seven bishops into the West of mist and mystery . Scorn nothing . And never tradition . As a Jew , I counsel this . " He was so sure of himself that our college , mostly Andalusians and therefore men of abundant confidence , gave him our most meticulous heed although he already had strained our credibility . If he sensed the skepticism , he nevertheless chose to hammer on . " We know that strange trees have washed to the shores of Ireland and Scotia . That strange birds have been seen . Whence came they ? Cathay ? Never ! For Marco Polo discovered , and we have confirmed , that Cathay is a place of seafarers . Assuredly then "  --  he smiled at the simplicity of his own logic  --  " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees to Europe 's shores they would have moved Cathay'sships , or the wreckage thereof : if Cathay were so near . " The point impressed even the Dominicans and they stole glances , each at the next . Teacher Marino clasped his hands behind him and hunched his shoulders for one more thrust . " It is not Cathay . Of this I am convinced . It is not India or even Asia . It is unknown land of a sedentary people , if there are people there at all . " His voice rose in the passion of his scholarly vision . " New Land ! New flora ! New fauna ! A virgin world , a treasure chest , awaiting the touch of Jason . " I was enthralled and my heart beat a cadence to the drumming of his words and then he closed his formal lecture with a quotation from the ancient Medea of Seneca : " There will come a time in the long years of the world when the ocean sea will loosen the shackles that bind things together and a great part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the one who was Jason 's guide , whose name was Thyphis , shall discover a new world , and then shall Thule be no longer the last of lands . ' " 42The prophecy echoed against the high ceiling and the stone walls and he bowed his gratitude for our attention , and the college , led by Fray Juan , arose and bowed its tribute to his wisdom . Then Marino relaxed at the podium and scratched his beard and neck , and flexed his muscles in a luxurious stretch , until his audience was still again . " We have arrived at the hour of discussion , " he said , and the college no longer was stiff and formal . He reached into his doublet and lifted forth an orange and sucked it noisily , and spat out the pips . Fray Juan took a handful of beans from his habit and soon his jaw was revolving again . " From the court of Portugal , there has come to the town of Palos de la Frontera --  " Teacher Marino laid the wrinkled orange on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Rabida , which is near Palos  --  a most extraordinary adventurer who gives the name of Christopher Columbus --  " It was the first time I heard his name and it impressed itself upon me only because it was the name of my saint , the sturdy Christopher who braved bridgeless waters in the service of mankind . " One report is that this Columbus is a Genoese explorer , a cosmographerof envious repute . " The learned Marino was discoursing as matter-of-factly as a merchant discussing accounts . " Another report is that he is a Galician astronomer . Neither of these is true as no ChristopherColumbus is counted among the scholars of Spain or Genoa . " It came to me then that this was the strange pilot mentioned by Alonso Pinzon to my father that day on the barge . Obviously Columbushad arrived from Portugal and had gone to Palos while Pinzon was vet in Seville . Here was a suggestion of mystery , possibly of deception , and my interest , nettled by his name , increased with each observation propoundedby our teacher . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a most singular fact : he has a copy of Toscanelli 's map of the Ocean Sea , a work prepared exclusively for the King of Portugal . And , most interesting of all , he seeks support for an expedition westward and glibly prattles knowledge of India that we do not have . Therefore , it might behoove this college to invite this alien to our counsels . And now I surrender this podium to Juan Ruiz dc Medina who "  --  a quick smile lighted his face  --  " as the Queen 's Inquisitor is in position to extract facts that are denied to me . " He stepped back to a bench near the wall and Fray Juan arose slowly , gouging his teeth with a long fingernail to dislodge the bean hulls , and moved to the station of authority . There he unrolled the43scroll he had prepared and began reading , his Latin being as proper as that of Teacher Marino 's . " In the name of God , the Clement : " Firstly . " My fray wet his lips as though to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college to share his wisdom , feigned or genuine , with us . He seeks audience with our blessed Queen here in Seville and is concerned only with money and grants , and not with impoverished Friars Preachers of the sweet St. Dominic . Also --  " A grimace twisted his lips . " He wears the girdle of the Third Order of St. Francis and , regretfully , Franciscans do not willingly share their benefits with Dominicans . " Secondly . This Columbus is most secretive as to his origin . He has left the impression that he is a native of Genoa , or at least of the province of Liguria , but never so declaring forthrightly . Moreover , he neither speaks nor writes Italian , but rather Spanish with a Catalan accent , and idioms of an earlier age . " Thirdly . " Fray Juan paused and motioned to one of his fellow Dominicans , who looked around and rapped the nodding heads of two students , extracting a howl from them that brought titters from the other students and a raucous guffaw from our portly prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of inquiry once was in the employ of Di Negro and Spinola , the renowned Genoese exporters , in the capacity of a traveling agent , or salesman . As such , he traveled possibly to England . He pretends to have visited Ultima Thule ' and Ireland . The first we challenge categorically ; the second we accept suspiciously . " Already , looking back at it now , the Fates had cast my lot with Christopher Columbus , for as my Dominican mentor indicted the adventurer I found myself leaning his way in spirit . At least he was in activity and accomplishment , at least he was daring attempt things while his critics canted scholarly judgment . Fray Juan cleared his throat and held the scroll closer to his eyes . " Fourthly . This Columbus has turned his hand at seamanship in many ways and is a proved captain , a man of masterly persuasion . He has sailed as a corsair in the service of France 's Rene Anjou and under the standard of a French admiral also named Columbus , or , more properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My ears burned for more and my spine tingled in anticipation , for'Iceland. here indeed was mystery and a hint of devious plots and plans , with fame and fortune as the prize ; a New Land as the booty . " Fifthly . As a raider under French colors , he attacked Genoese shipping ; a most remarkable incident . For if he be Genoese , would he fight his own state ? In a battle off Cape St. Vincent , eight years ago , his ship was sunk by the Genoese and he was cast upon the Portuguese shore . The firm of Di Negro and Spinola has , as you know , offices in Lisbon , and the adventurer , a man of rare guile and laudable patience , ingratiated himself into their service and made the voyages of which he boasts , or , more truthfully , some of them . The lure of the open sea gripped him in Portugal , for , as is well known , the fever of explorationis epidemic in that kingdom and Lisbon is in ferment with schemes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unknown Sea . " Fray Juan laid his scroll on the podium and rested his eyes while his colleagues yawned and stretched , a luxury they denied the students . Benjamin Marino was staring at the ceiling in obvious contemplation of all he had heard , and I was eager for resumption of the session ; my fancy churning my mind into images of gallant caravels in boiling seas . The college settled again into silence and Fray Juan picked up his scroll and continued . " Sixthly . At Lisbon 's convent of the Military Order of St. James , where maidens are trained in virtuous endeavor , Christopher Columbus met Felipa Moniz Perestrello , a lady of noble birth , and , most important , the sister of Bartholomew Perestrello , governorof the Isle of Porto Santo , which is a steppingstone to the Ocean Sea . This lady became his wife and bore him a son , christened Diego , and then this Columbus took residence on the said island of Porto Santo and there had frequent opportunities to engage in nautical enterprises and thus improve his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that outpost and examined them shrewdly on their adventures and observations . " Seventhly . One Martin Vicente , pilot , showed him a utility found floating some two thousand miles west of Portugal and made of a wood unknown in Europe . One Pedro Correa , pilot , showed him a cane tree , also found floating , each section of which would hold a gallon of wine . A persistent report , although wisely suspect , asserts that Columbus talked with the valiant Alonso Sanchez soon after that navigator was washed ashore on Porto Santo and a few days before the redoubtable Sanchez expired from the ordeals of his adventure , and , as we all know , 44 45Sanchez insisted he had seen the shores of Antilia beyond the Ocean Sea . " Even the dunderheads among the students were alert at this junctureof the report and I , enthralled by the unfolding narrative , was annoyed that Fray Juan should hesitate long enough to clear his throat and mop his brow on the hem of his mantle . " Eighthly . It is possible , albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santo the Unknown Pilot whose exploits , fanciful or real , have sharpened the imaginations of all men concerned with exploration . My investigation of this story has foundered on the rocks of myth and rumors , but the Unknown Pilot swore that , blown from his course , he sailed about seven hundred leagues west and there came upon a floating meadow --  " A gasp went up from the college and even the unperturbable BenjaminMarino arched his black eyebrows , and Fray Juan hammered on : " Yes , a floating meadow . A sea of grass . And through this he sailed and saw an island , but so frightened were his sailors that they forced him to turn back . This corresponds , in position and description , to the Newly Discovered Island that appeared so mysteriously on Bedaire 's map of sixty years ago and subsequently on Bianco 's map with the legend : Questo he mar di Spagna . Here is Spain 's sea . " My fray moistened his lips and thrust out his chin and I envisioned how he looked and how he performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relentless as he recruited for old Quemaderoand the faggots of purification . " Ninthly . From Porto Santo , this Columbus returned to Portugal and eked out an existence by drawing charts and tracing maps and then , abetted by the influence of his wife 's family , projected himself into the councils of his betters . Let us assume that this is the point where he came into knowledge of Toscanelli 's map , although that document was prepared under the patronage of King John of Portugal and was a state paper , supposedly safe from the prying eyes of schemers . " The constant disdain and frequent flares of contempt were so flagrant , and the bias so obvious , that I was puzzled as to why Fray Juan was so scathing of a man he did not know except through channels open only to an Inquisitor . Was it because the stranger seemingly preferred Franciscans to Dominicans ? Nonsense . Juan Ruiz de Medinawas as loyal to his order as any friar , but he was not a blinded partisan in matters of letters . " Meanwhile --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthened . " His wife died and left their son , Diego , only a year or soout of swaddling clothes . This blow did not deter Christopher Columbusone whit from a dream he was nourishing into an obsession . Eventually he reached King John himself and brazenly proposed a voyage to India , advocating with more fervor than reason that Asia is 700 leagues across the Ocean Sea . It is astounding but true , the King of Portugal was swayed by the indomitable audacity of this interloperwho offered not one item of nautical lore or wisdom that was new to Portuguese mariners . When pressed for facts , or even theory , he wrapped himself in a cloak of omnipotence like a prophet from the wilderness , argued that he was anointed of God to find the Holy City of the Mysteries , and prattled parables about the rivers of Paradise and pretended knowledge for himself that is known to no other man . So eloquent was his plea that King John actually asked his terms --  " Here my fray paused and smiled , and it was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without one gold ducat in his purse , without one sail at his command , this namesake of our stalwart St. Christopher did propose to voyage west or south and discover happy lands , islands , and terra firma most rich in gold , silver , aloes , pearls , and precious stones and infinite peoples ; and to come upon the lands of India and the kingdoms of the Grand Khan , the same having been previously dicovered to the east by Marco Polo . " Several students snickered and a few of the friars themselves smiled their amusement at such fancy , at such wild dreaming . Benjamin Marino , however , did not smile . His brow was furrowed in thought and his eyes never left the countenance of Juan Ruiz de Medina , Inquisitorfor the Queen and judge of conversos . " In payment for this fantastic enterprise --  " Fray Juan 's face was solemn again . " This said Christopher Columbus , known as ChristovamColom in Portugal , demanded immediate knighthood and golden spurs . Next he demanded heraldry and titles perpetually , includingAdmiral of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Benjamin Marino , and even I smiled at the temerity of an itinerant entrepreneur , a pauperized wayfarer and promotor , presuming such demands of the King of Portugal . " Hold ! And hear you ! " My Dominican mentor held up his hand for silence . " Furthermore , he demanded one tenth of all income accruingto the King within limits of the Admiralty . One pearl of every ten pearls ! One ounce of gold of every ten ounces ! In addition to all this , he also demanded the right to contribute one eighth of the ex-46 47penses of every expedition to any lands he discovered and to derive one-eighth profit . " A gale of laughter swept the college and even Benjamin Marino smiled . Fray Juan waited until the merriment subsided and then added : " The King of Portugal declined . " The Inquisitor rolled the scroll and tied it and put it away , and a fellow Dominican handed him another , which he opened carefully and resumed his array . " Tenthly . Rebuffed in Portugal , this unspurredknight.errant of ludicrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that those kingdoms are remiss in knowledge of cosmography and astronomy , he decided that Queen Isabel should be his patron and that our Spain should launch his expedition to India . His retreat from Portugal was most furtive , possibly due to debt but more likely because he had seen the Toscanellimap and had noted its secrets . " Lastly . In a manner we have not solved , he secured passage for himself and his son , Diego , now of five years , and left Lisbon for the Condado de Niebla , 2 that territory that includes Andalusia 's Palos , Huelva , and other ports . He landed at Palos , wearing the garb of the lay order of the Friars Minor , and , his son by his side , walked the three miles to the Franciscan monastery at La Rabida ; well aware of the hospitality of the Minorites and surely also aware that the prior of La Rabida has confessed the Queen and is among her favorites . " Fray Juan Perez welcomed the stranger and offered sanctuary and schooling for Diego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio de Marchena , the astronomer of the monasteryand a man of quizzical mind and boundless curiosity . Fray Antonio himself saw to it that our new luminary was in communication with the Duke of Medina-Sidonia -- - " The words quickened my brain and awakened sleeping intelligence . Fray Juan Ruiz de Medina was of the same lineage as the Duke of Medina-Sidonia . Was this then the source of my mentor 's information ? But why the antagonism ? The bias and contempt ? Why a hundred things ? " And , as is known to every Spaniard --  " Fray Juan was reciting without a glance at his scroll . " The Duke of Medina-Sidonia is the'Condado de Niebla , hereafter called the Niebla , was a small area on the Atlantic , facing North Africa , and included the towns of Palos , Huelva , and loguer , and the lower reaches of the rivers Tinto and Odiel , which flow into the Saltes River and thence to the Atlantic. 48richest man in the kingdom and a confidant of our gracious Queen . He has seen a map based on Toscanelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself Christopher . This map --  " His voice crackled ridicule . " This devilish hoax has the Cipango3 of Marco Polo 's journey only 700 leagues west of the Canary Isles and in the position of Antilia.4 " This is his secret ; that Cipango and Antilia are the same . This is the lodestone with which he intrigues to lure our Queen into a recklessventure for his own profit . " Fray Juan dropped the scroll on the stand and it rolled into shape and he tied it and put it under his arm , then faced us all . " In conclusion , a few observations . This Columbus , this charlatan in matters mundane , is , nevertheless , firm in the Faith , a man of much piety and frequent prayers . However --  " His tone hardened to a rasp . " This shipless mariner , this impostor , seeks the company , the solace , and the wisdom of conversos at every opportunity . " So that was it . That explained the prejudice , the cynical denunciationby the Inquisitor . Christopher Columbus trafficked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This charge demanded an immediate explanation and Fray Juan was quick to give it . " Let it be said , in justice to truth , that the conversos of his circle all are true Christians , staunch in the Faith and high in the graces of our Queen . They are men of wealth and influence , which may explain his affinity . I submit to this college , as I will submit to the Queen , that Christopher Columbus , if that be his true name , is a man to be watched . " He bowed his head and mumbled a Pax vobiscum and we mumbled the same words in echo , and the morning session was over . All the students crowded around Benjamin Marino and none gave attention or praise to my fray , and he , in majestic solitude , walked slowly out of the hall . I , too , preferred a minute of chitchat with Teacher Marino , but I renounced that privilege and caught up with Fray Juan and fell in step with him . He was the one who could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , see Maraela Harana , and so it was his favors I curried . ' Japan . Cuba ? 49 " A masterly presentation , " I volunteered , seeking to flatter him . " This Columbus is a trickster . " He turned his cold , yellow eyes on me and grunted . " The same was said of Marco Polo , who gave us more knowledge of the East than any man , before or since . " Then he looked into the blue distance , the sky free and unbounded . " At least this wandering and homeless Christopher dares dream of a new world and dares scheme its conquest while we peck at his flesh like starving ravens . " I did not comprehend . He had condemned in public and now he defended in private , and I was turning the riddle in my mind when he said : " It is not necessary , Rodrigo , to pamper my vanity . A visit to your father will depend on your knowledge of Isidore . I will examine you Friday morning . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and busy . So is Luis 1-larana and his daughter . Your friend Mudarra , the wise old fool , is making her a vase with a glaze of azure and gold . " I thanked him again and went to my stall and there waded into the morass of Isidore until boredom subdued my ambition , and then I stepped to my window and watched that small portion of the city that was visible to me . First the ships , and no new ones were in , and next the streets , along which sauntered groups of soldiers in convivial abandon . Seville was accustomed to soldiers and these were the King 's own guard , stationed in Seville because the court was here , and awaiting his command which would send them , and all the army , against the Moors in Granada . Ships and soldiers , and the Andalusian sun in golden glory behind the Castle of Triana , where the Inquisitors met . The dying splendor of Moorish grandeur in western Europe ; old Quemadero and his cracklingwrath ; and now Christopher Columbus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe for a thousand years , maybe forever . What an age was my youth . However , I had no thoughts for such things , for in the sun 's golden warmth I saw only the radiance of Maraela 's hair . There was a surging in my heart and a yearning in my loins and for this I was ashamed of my manliness and sought to banish my lustful hunger ; but it had seized me and I surrendered my mind to my enraptured fancy , kindling an image of Maraela in sweet and joyous submission , and knowing this was one sin I would never confess to Juan Ruiz de Medina. 50C H A P T E R 5Y NEXT MARINO LECTURE CAME ON WEDNESDAY AND Iremember the event most vividly because on that occasion I first heard mention of the Marino map , which was another thread the Fates wove into the tapestry of my life . I am positive of the day inasmuch as Fray Juan was not present , and it was his custom to give Wednesdaysto his duties at the Court of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire on Friday . I sat next to our capacious prior , whose belly frequently rumbled his morning chick-peas and onions , and these finding vent in gaseous detonations which disturbed the other friars and amused the students . Benjamin Marino seemingly was impervious to such physiological phenomena , and gave his attention to his involved discourse on Cardinald'Ailly , chancellor of the Sorbonne and author of Imago Mundi , a Gallic Prince of the Church and ludicrously ignorant of Spain 's geography . Regretfully I record that the learned Marino gave more attention than he received , as most of us already were versed in D'Ailly 's flummery , and this including his thesis on the Phoenix bird and Asbestos stones that burned forever , and on griffins , on blackbirds of dazzling whiteness , trees of golden fruit , and gems in the skulls of dragons . This nonsense , I suppose , was acceptable to France 's Sorbonne , but Spanish colleges scorned such drivel and , as is well known , our institutions were infinitely superior to all others in the world . ( The foregoing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that D'Ailly 's Imago Mundi was one of Columbus ' guidebooks and that he had underscored all references to gold and pearls , and Jews and jewelry , the conjugation of which , even in my youth , had given rise to many witty maxims and arrant puns . ) As Teacher Marino droned on and on , my mind wandered first to my immediate surroundings and then to food and then , inevitably and without struggle on my part , to Maraela . I was drowsing in my sensual contemplations when Benjamin Marino said : 51 " I have been requested by Don Luis de la Cerda , the fifth Count and first Duke of Medinaceli , to prepare a map of the Ocean Sea . This commission I have accepted . " ( Yes , a hundred times yes ! And hear me , Mita , and believe me , my beloved , my bewitching flame of a thousand nights . By the bones of Abraham , by the True Cross , by the Black Stone of the holy Kaaba  --  I heard him say it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was hunched over the podium , his eyes blazing his visions and his voice strong and unafraid . ) The mention of Cerda brought my mind quickly from its reverie , and my head snapped up , as did our prior 's , his pudgy face suddenly hard and his stare cold . For Don Luis de la Cerda was of Spain 's most noble lineage and whereas not as rich as the Duke of MedinaSidonia , who had shown interest in Christopher Columbus , he was , nevertheless , more influential at court ; and like the Duke , and like Columbus also , Cerda was an advocate of Franciscan pre-eminence in affairs of state , learning , and ecclesiastical jurisprudence . Was this , then , a devious machination of Franciscan conception to entice Benjamin Marino from the Dominicans ? That is why our collegeinstantly was alert and why I gave my unstinted attention to the words of our geographer . We did not connect the events with ChristopherColumbus at all . Not then . We were concerned only with our lecturer 's association with Cerda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subject of his map and made no pretenses of secrecy . " For this work , " he said , " I will use the theorem of El Fargani , who , more than seven hundred years ago , used 56% miles to the degree as the proper measurement of the earth . Now --  " He held up his hands and touched his fingers to emphasize his point . " El Fargani 's miles were Arabic miles , each of 1,973.50 meters . Our modern cosmographers have based their calculations on El Fargani 's dictum , but have broken his degrees into Italian miles , which are much shorter than Arabic miles . Hence a great error . " A twinkle of mirth came to his eyes and he said : " It is possible that Christopher Columbus , a subject of discussion here the day before yesterday , is a victim of this delusion . I shall strive to avoid it . " I will presume to fix the meridian on Gomera , that western point of the Canary Islands . Seven hundred leagues west I shall place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terra incognita , land of which we know naught . But it is not India ! The world is52larger than you think . Over and over I say to you : the world is larger than you think . " His lecture was given over then to facts and tables and again my mind wandered and remained on its wool-gathering journey until Benjamin Marino concluded his discourse and turned the session over to our prior for discussion . The prior , dripping sweat , expediently was concerned with things closer than India and exhorted us to patriotic endeavor . The infidels were still in Granada and it was the duty of every Andalusian to support the Crown and drive the Moors in the sea . Oh , that he were young enough to lift lance and sword himself . And this from the Dominican who once had supported Rome against his Queen . Yes , he had heard that indulgences were being sold and the money given for the Granada campaign . This was justified ; so he said . Yes , he was aware that some convicted heretics were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against the Moors . This , too , was proper , we were told , inasmuch as the end justified the means . Then our prior , using a scroll that bore the royal ribbons , read the new mule law and praised it as an example of the Crown 's astute statecraft , and urged rigid adherence to its provisions . Of course , the prior himself was exempt from the regulation by royal sanction . The mule law ? Your smile is forgiven and I take no umbrage , being aware that few men have connected King Ferdinand 's mule ban to discovery of the New Lands , although it is a strand in the rope that Christopher Columbus swung from Palos to San Salvador , as important , surely , as the broken tiller that bedeviled us , as the bits of tarred rope that almost caused a mutiny . Now this mule law was a war measure . The Andalusian mule , as is well known , is the best in the world and is prized highly for purposes of saddle as well as husbandry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are too expensive for common use . Therefore , in those days mules were plentiful and horses were rather scarce , and King Ferdinand needed horses for his cavalry . Hence , he simply banned mules as saddle beasts , except by royal permit , and thereby gave impetus to horse breeding . To deny an Andalusian his saddle mule was to shorten his legs and the law brought howls from the people , and many violations with subsequent punishment . It was this punishment that helped launch our expeditionacross the Ocean Sea . It was a mule and not a miracle . It was the53hybrid foal of a jack and a mare and not the heavenly anointment of Christopher Columbus ' broad forehead . After the morning session and a lesson on mulery to season BenjaminMarino 's lecture , I returned to my quarters and gave all that day to Isidore , and then Fray Juan examined me . I am sure he was pleased with my progress , although he gave no hint thereof , for he tarried with me and talked of ships and geography . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask about Cerda 's commission for the map . " It is true , " my fray said . " Benjamin Marino will enter the employ of Don Luis de la Cerda . " " Then the Friars Minor are taking him away from us . " I was indignantand assumed the Dominicans would protest this Franciscan outrage . " Benjamin Marino belongs to the world , Rodrigo . " Fray Juan stroked his chin and if he felt any bitterness he concealed it . " I have sought a commission for a Marino map , but our prior and King Ferdinand think the Moorish War is more important than the Ocean Sea . So Don Luis de la Cerda opened his own purse , and if the Franciscans profit then so will the world . " He sighed his resignation to events he could not master . " Aye , little brother , Benjamin Marino belongs to all . " " But he is our teacher . " I was dismayed and angry , for defeat is a thing I have never taken lightly and the Franciscans had bested us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then smiled , apparently seeking to allay my anger . " There are other teachers . We should be grateful for the knowledge Marino has given us . He will be leaving soon . " " To eat the rich viands of Don Luis de la Cerda and slake his thirst on the distilled metaphysics of the Minorites ? " A short , quick laugh , a lean expression of mirth , escaped my fray . " No Christian lance will ever pierce the Jewish armor of Benjamin Marino . He is not going to Don Luis at all . He is going home to do his work . " " Catalonia ? " " Yes . To his wife and children ; a son , I am sure , and a daughter , I think . " IIe yawned the drowsiness of autumn 's somnolence . " I will send you the writings of El Fargani . You read Arabic ? " " Why , no , Father . " I was so surprised that I forgot to call him brother. 54 " But you speak it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught you . " " Not much , Fray Juan . " I corrected my error . " Only some conversationalArabic and a few proverbs . " " Including praise of Mohammed . " The Inquisitor lifted the latch on my door . " I , for one , think we should teach Arabic in our college , but I am alone in this idea . Therefore , learn all that Mudarra offers . He is wiser than most men think . " Fray Juan stepped back to my bench and picked up the book of Isidore to take it away , thank the Mercy of God , and laid his hand on my shoulder . " But do not repeat the praises of Mohammed , Rodrigo . These are times when men are indicted by innuendo and judged by rumors and hysteria . " He was gone and a cold terror gnawed in my breast , for I knew by his warning that Mudarra had been discussed in the Court of the Inquisition , and if Mudarra the Morisco , then what of Luis Harana the converso ? Or Maraela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by misgivings and that night I dreamed of djinn and other evil spirits , and of old Quemadero ; his molten lust embracing Maraela and her shining face wreathed by flames , like the saintly countenance of Jeanne , The Maid , dead at Rouen for fiftythreeyears while her ashes kindled fires of protest in all Europe . Then the next morning I heard Benjamin Marino 's last lecture to the College of Seville . It was only my third and yet it seems now that I knew him well , but that , I know , is my old age exaggerating the distinction of my youth , a failing common to most men after forty . Actually I saw the great Marino three times and never spoke one word to him , but he is engraved on my memory like the wind etchings on the Pillars of Hercules . Fray Juan , in reward for work well done , gave me permission to visit my father 's shop again on Friday afternoon , and I drew a jar of water from the well in the patio and washed myself all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand , brushing them as best I could . I walked jauntily out of the monastery and among a muddle of soldiers on leave , and rapidly to the store in the hope that Harana was there and perhaps Maraela , and I was determined to see her even by ruse if necessary . My father was at his desk , examining accounts with a clerk from the Seville agency of the House of the Medici , the powerful Italian bankersand merchants ; this clerk being one Amerigo Vespucci who was well known to us as a Florentine braggart , a liar of indefatigable practice , and a counting-room sailor. 55Harana was not present , neither Maraela ; Amerigo Vespucci and my father greeted me , Vespucci with a familiarity I did not reciprocate . Their conference was business and so I turned from them , after the proper amenities , and walked into Mudarra 's shop . The old man was napping at his wheel and , awakened by my entrance , cocked one eye at me and muttered , " Assalamu alaih "  --  the greeting and peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glanced around , conscious that something was different . All the putrid odors , so offensive on my last visit , were gone and the room was spotlessly clean , although sand and water had failed to remove the blood spots under the cask . " Maraela , " the old potter explained , anticipating my question . " She had my stable scoured and sees that it is kept that way . " He mouthed the words , chewing them into mangled Spanish as though contemptuousof the realm 's language . I sat on his bench and , after a lapse that should have concealed my curiosity , I said , " I thought perhaps she might be here . " Mudarra yawned and scratched and actually was civil in his reply . " She comes twice a week . And her father is here only in the mornings . Business is flourishing again , Rodrigo , which explains the presence of that Florentine toadeater in the showroom . " I was turning in my mind an excuse to visit the hlarana home when Mudarra , squinting at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is mooning also a lesson from your Dominican masters ? What other drivel have they seeped through your armored skull ? " " Isidore , " I answered and none too politely . " That madman ! That eater of meat with his fouled hand ! " He spat his disgust . " That dabbler in mysteries too deep for his puny mind --  " " And El Fargani . " I interrupted his tirade . IHis eyes popped wide and his clapping tongue suddenly was stilled , and then he nodded approval . " Well , now , that is better . Peace to the bones of El Fargani . " " And I learned of a most extraordinary man . " I was saving the choice morsel until last . " One Christopher Columbus , mariner . " " The Redhead of La Rabida ? " He began pedaling his wheel and cleaning its surface with a rag that he dipped in water . " Redhead ? " My surprise abused my composure . " Do you know him ? " He laughed his derision and pumped his wheel furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did not your Dominican56hinnies tell you he is of rusty countenance and red hair ? A most singularappearance for one of Genoese extraction . " " I did not know that . " All the wind was out of my sails . " I know only his Portuguese story and that he is at La Rabida and seeking patronage of the Duke of Medina-Sidonia . " Old Mudarra broke into a cackling laugh and he slapped his knee in visible approval of himself . " Tell Juan Ruiz de Medina that his Inquisition has lost its eyes and ears . Tell him it is a tiding from Mudarra the Morisco . " His mirth wrinkled his face into dry parchment . " Christopher Columbus is not at La Rabida . The Duke of Medina-Sidoniahas washed his hands of the matter . Columbus demanded the moon in his lap and a silver spoon with which to eat it . " Here was good news , an indication that the Franciscans had failed to ally their protege with the richest house in Spain . This would please my fellows at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sifting for facts in matters of pertinence . I was jaunty again and the wind was back in my sails , and then Mudarra snapped the mast . " Christopher Columbus is in the home of Don Luis de la Cerda at El Puerto and under the patronage of that bilious lackey of Isabel 's court . " Cerda ! Columbus with Cerda , and this the Queen 's favorite and Franciscan partisan who had commissioned our Marino to map the Ocean Sea . The news agitated me and left me most distraught , so much so that for a minute I forgot even Maraela and the real purpose of my visit . " Where did you learn this , Mudarra --  " " More questions . " He jeered my inquiry and raised his finger to point in my face and I pushed it aside , gently , to be sure , but firmly . " Where did you learn this , Mudarra ? " Slowly I repeated my request . He blinked at me and looked into my face , then at my shoulders , most broad for my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said almost sadly , " has grown into a ram . The head high and proud and the horns curving strong , and seed in his groin . " He stopped his wheel by pressinghis knee against its edge , and nodded toward the front room . " The Medici have more fingers than the Inquisition , Rodrigo . That is why they are the most powerful house in Europe . And Amerigo Vespucci is a chattering jay . " So Vespucci was the source . Then I must know more and walked resolutely into the salesroom to question him on this matter of concern to my college and to my Dominican brothers . The Florentine was gone and my father was frowning over his ledgers. 57 " I was going to call you in a minute . " My father pushed the books aside . " Sit on the bench there and tell me of yourself . " The bench was under a shelf of aloes and I sat down and crossed my legs . " I was hoping Amerigo Vespucci was still here , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Columbus , mariner . Know you of him ? " My father nodded . " Every merchant in Andalusia knows that he has arrived in Spain to finagle a westward voyage of exploration . A most secretive stranger , however . And cagey . " " He is under the stewardship of Don Luis de la Cerda . " I felt most important discussing current affairs with my father . " Yes , I know . " " And Cerda has enticed Benjamin Marino from our college . " My father flipped his hand upward in a gesture of impatience . " Monastical politics . I care not a tittle for the feuds of friars over their accursed inquisitorial powers . " His face was reddening and his tone was stern . " If the Franciscans use Cerda to wheedle the Queen 's sanction for a westward expedition , we all are their debtors . " He was right and , sitting in his presence , the schisms and schemes of the orders seemed abstract and mean , for above us was the sky and there was the river flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we believed . I changed the subject , approaching a matter closer to my heart . " Mudarra tells me business is better since you accepted the association of Harana . " The flush left his cheeks and his eyes twinkled his geniality and this was his nature inasmuch as he was blessed with adequate bile and hence favorable humors . He arose from his desk and reached to the shelf above my head and took down a most hideous object of wrinkled tentacles and mushy substance . I drew away instinctively and asked , " What is it ? " " The Medusa , " he said proudly . " Also called the devil 's fig tree . Properly it is a euphorbia , named for Euphorbus , King Juba 's physician . " " An aloe ! " I exclaimed and touched the thing gingerly . It was the size of my two fists and with tendrils , or fingers , squirming out in vulgar abundance . My father put it on his desk as carefully as though it were the Cup itself . " It is more valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Medusa of Mauretania , found in the Atlas Mountains , and the world 's best source of emetic drugs . " He leaned over and smelled it and wrinkled58his nose . " It also is a specific for the stomach maladies that will follow the army into Granada . " " Can you get more ? " I dared smell the thing , too , and its odor was wet and succulent . Inasmuch as it came from North Africa , where the Moorish ban was drum-tight , I knew its rarity . My father smiled , somewhat wryly I thought , and shrugged . " Luis Harana furnished this one and I did not pry into his source . If he can supply aloes , I can sell them . " I asked of Harana 's health and of Maraela 's , hoping to swing the conversation to her , and my father assured me they were well and , in mentioning them , his tone assumed a bland flavor that was not like my father at all . Then he shoved one of his ledgers closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling for 7000 maravedis a hundredweight in India and zro , 000 a hundredweight in Seville , for so taut was Islam 's curtain over the East . The profit on ginger was even more and England was begging for ginger at any price . Aloes , between Africa and the apothecary'sjar , fetched a margin of 15,000 maravedis a pound , even at smugglers ' costs . I whistled my surprise at the figures and my father closed the book and handed it to me . " It is Luis Harana 's custom to check the accounts each afternoon about sundown . " " Does he come here ? " I asked hopefully . " No . " My father turned his face and looked out upon the alley , at the soldiers jostling by . " I take the books to him . " I felt the flush mounting my cheeks and clamped my lips to hold hack the protest that burned my tongue . My father an errand boy for a rich converso ? Luis Harana 's presumption needed a quick sting of Andalusian dignity . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper contemplation that my father had his reasons . He drummed his fingers on the ledger and the twinkle was back in his eyes . " I was thinking perhaps you could deliver the record this afternoon , Rodrigo . It would save me a trip and , as you can see , I am busy . " Now that was different . At my age it was quite fitting for me to wait upon an elderly gentleman , especially my father 's own associate . Besides , I was willing to crawl from the shop to the residence of Maraela . " If I can be of service to you , sir --  " I bowed to my father and reached for the book . He laughed and then I laughed , and he told me which was the59Harana house on the Street of Felicity . I put the ledger under my arm and walked to the door , and old Mudarra called from the back room . " In sha Allah , Amir el bahr . " He was calling me admiral again . " And remember that from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messenger . " My face tingled my mortification and embarrassment and I bolted through the doorway before he said more . The Harana residence was near the river , at the end of the street and through a sheltered passageway , lonely in its location and almost concealed from the casual eye . The door was bolted and I swung the clapper against the bronze cymbal , on which was engraved : " Luis Harana , Merchant . " Harana himself cracked the door and peered at me , then nodded for me to enter . I stepped inside a hallway heavily draped and leading directly to the dining room , where candles burned on a table set with many bowls and plates . I was motioned into a large room off the hall and Harana held out his hand and I gave him the ledger . Maraela was nowhere in sight . " Thank you , Rodrigo , " her father said and bowed quite gracefully for a Catalan , but did not offer the hospitality of his home , or even a bench for a minute 's visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dreamed all week and , even in those days , I was never one to accept defeat without a thrust in my own behalf . So I glanced around the room in a manner most gauche , caring not one whit if Luis Harana thought me untrained in the graces . I was resolved upon any artifice to delay my departure and thus compel him , if he had manners at all , to offer me a seat and the vintage of his table . A poniard in a leather case was hanging by the window and I pretendedimmediate interest in the dagger and extracted it from its shield , exclaiming my delight although , truthfully , I knew nothing of such weapons except that they were the favorites of sailors . " Ah ! Damascus , " I said and ran my thumb along the triangular blade . " Toledo , " he replied flatly . I was flustered and , hoping my chagrin was not evident , I balanced the knife on my palm and examined it closely , thus bowing my head to conceal the tinge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bar was the same metal as the blade and across it was engraved the ancient cry of Andalusia : " Trust God and hammer on ! " Harana was fidgety and I returned the poniard to its sheath and gave6omy attention to a tapestry by the door . " Ah , beautiful , " I said , dawdlingmy admiration in the manner of a critic . " Obviously Florentine . " He smiled in spite of himself and his face was gentle . " No , Rodrigo . My daughter wove it . " It was the opening I wanted , and I bore in . " I had hoped , sir , for the honor of seeing your daughter . " He looked at me without disapproval , I must say ; the smile softeninghis long countenance . " Your wish is my command , sir . " Luis Harana was the first man ever to call me " sir . " I bowed my gratitude and he stepped into the hallway and promptly was back with Maraela , and this indicating she had been near all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and a meshed chain of silver encircled her waist like a girdle . Her reception was courtly and exquisitely refined although perhaps a bit too cordial for an Andalusianmaiden , but , then , she was Catalan , and manners differ in Spain . Naturally , the warmth of her greeting pleased me exceedingly and she sat on a couch near her own tapestry . I remained standing until I Iarana left us , explaining that he would be in the next room , checking the ledger I had brought . I took no offense that he did not close the door between us and him . For a minute or so , as becomes good breeding , I walked around the room and commented on the pictures and congratulated Maraela on her family 's excellent taste . Her gaze followed me and that was the reason for my demonstration ; to give her an opportunity to see and judge me without our eyes meeting . I stood before her own tapestry and said , " It is magnificent . " " It is nothing , Rodrigo . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tingle to my manliness and I sat on the couch and was near enough to detect i he anise of her perfume . She folded her hands in her lap and her eyes were downcast in maidenly propriety . " Your father says you are doing well at the college . " It was an invitation for me to pursue that subject and this I did , launching into a discourse on Benjamin Marino , whose name evicted no interest from her , and then on Fray Juan , the mention of whom brought her eyes up to mine . " Juan Ruiz de Medina ? " she asked . " The Inquisitor ? " " Only in Seville , " I explained . " Yes , I know . Torquemada  --  Fray Tomas de Torquemada  --  is being made Inquisitor-General for all of Spain . " 6rHere was intelligence of which I had no knowledge and I was displeasedthat she , a girl , should have information about which I was ignorant . Apparently she sensed my embarrassment , for she said quickly , " We hear things outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mussy . " I am aware of the lineage of Tomas de Torquemada , prior of Santa Cruz , " I said . " He is a Dominican in the Queen 's graces and favored of the Pope himself . A scourge of heresy . " Then skillfully I shifted the subject to my father 's business , elaborating at length on the aloe her father had furnished , the Medusa of Mauretania . " It was discovered by King Juba , " I said in airy assurance . " King Juba II , " she replied demurely . " He wed Cleopatra Selene , the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra . Do you know his lineage too ? " Her blue eyes bespoke sweet innocence , but the delicate smile indicated a wit and talent that is rare in her sex . I laughed at my own confutation and congratulated her on her nimbleness and was bold enough to praise her raiment . She held up her hand to halt my flattery and for an ecstatic moment I thought she was going to touch me , but slowly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes again . I might have spoken the urge of my heart even then , being a victim of my own rash impulses , but Harana came into our presence and laid the ledger beside me . " I thank you , Rodrigo , " he said . " And tell your father all is well and in order . " Maraela arose and excused herself and I spoke hastily . " Next week , to help my father , I will bring the records again . " I wanted her to hear me , and she did ; her eyes telling me so . There were no clouds that afternoon and yet I walked on clouds back to the shop and returned the accounts to my father . " That was a pleasant chore , " I said . " The ledger will be here next Friday . " He indicated the corner of the desk where it would be . " The errand is a service for which I am grateful . " Then he embraced me and counseled me to diligence and piety , and I shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was determined to be back at the college for vespers . The streets were swarming with soldiers and I gave them no thought . The river was swarming with ships and I saw them not . Only the blue of the sky , like her eyes , and the sun golden on the horizon , like her hair , and red in its farewell , like her lips . The joy of my youth took hold of me and budded into ambition and noble resolve . I would study hard and soon would enter my father 's business to honor the name of Bermejo . A merchant of Seville . Ah-h-h , worthy endeavor . And Maraela shared my dreams , the abode I would purchase by the river , my doublets and silk stockings in the alcove of my chamber , and an open passage between my couch and her boudoir . Where is the bridle for youth 's fancy ? The stone of reason to balance the hazy illusions ? The quickening from the slumber of things unreal ? The awakening from the dream of Alnaschar . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my years ; Clotho spinning my destiny , Lachesis disposing the lots , Atropos cutting the threads . Stygian sluts of the inner darkness , their river seven times around the world . They let me dream on . C H A P T E R 6 ND THUS IT WAS WITH ME . I applied myself zealously to my studies and other monasterial duties and conducted myself in a most exemplary manner to win favors from Fray Juan , particularly the fleeting surcease and liberty of Friday afternoons . Then always I hastened to my father 's shop and always the ledger was on a corner of his desk , and I tarried only long enough to exchange pleasantries with him and old Mudarra , and was away for my hour of Paradise with my lovely Maraela . It was always the same . I swung the clapper and Harana unbolted the door and peered at me and took the accounts , and I followed him into the hall and thence to the big room , and there she came to me and he went away , always bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the poniard and near her tapestry , but her father was always nigh , either in the adjoining room , the room of the open door , or padding about the house in his velvet slippers . We talked , she and I , of things as they were and sometimes , in the desperation of my ardor , I dared whisper of things as I dreamed62 - 63they could be . And always she listened and lowered her eyes , and saidnaught . Once , to stem the flow of my fervor , she touched my hand and her fingers were cold and I seized them and held them until the fire of my blood warmed them , and then slowly she pulled her hand away and raised her face to me and drank deeply of the desire in my eyes and murmured tenderly , " We are young , Rodrigo mine . " " I am almost sixteen , " I said . " A man 's age in Andalusia . " " I , too , will soon be sixteen , " she said . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and she moved it away , and I , calling on words I could not create , sought expression in an old Moorish poem that Mudana had taught me , and whispered the sentiment : " I come from fields of death , and in its sheathMy good sword rests ; but thou , 0 glaive of Love , Giv'st no repose ; still thou dost wound my heart With torments ever new . Afar , methought , Were pain and woe that could not well increase , Yet fiercer glow the fires within my breast As I draw near thee , Love ... " Impulsively she snatched my hand and held it hard in her lap , her fingernails biting into my flesh , and she closed her eyes and breathed the ode of Alhakem , the ancient elegy of the East : " From thy sweet eyes , in that sad hour of parting , There f ell hot tears ; but thine , they bathed thy cheek , And lay upon thy loveliest neck , a circlet Of pearls beyond all price . My tears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet Love , I marvel that the heart within me break not , For fain would then my soul have ta'en her flight . The tears that drowned my eyes were not from them , But from my heart ; and they betrayed their source , By that deep tint which never comes but thence ! " Through my tears of love 's sweet torment her golden hair shimmered like the horizon halo of sun embracing sea and I leaned close to entreather lips , but she drew away in fright as Harana moved in the next room and then joined us . He returned the ledger to me and said , " Tell your father all is well and in order . " 6564Always he said that and then , after Maraela had excused herself , Ile always opened the door for me and bade me good day , and always it was before sundown . At another time , a Friday soon after the New Year of 1485 , Maraela 's restraint relaxed again for a brief minute and her thigh touched mine as we sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room of the open door into the rear of the long hallway . She made no effort to loosen the seal between her loin and my loin and I felt the warmth through her garment and , most tenderly , I stroked her cheek . Again she seized my hand and buried it deep in her lap and , aroused by her transformation from maiden into nymph , I fumbled for her breasts and she tilted her head to the back of the couch and breathed rapidly in a spasm of elation . Then the footfalls again and she jerked erect , biting her lower lip into white pain as Harana came into our presence , the ledger in his hand and the bid of good day in his demeanor . Thus it was in the bloom of my first love , the sap strong from the roots and the flower sensitive and tipped with gold , and then pink in its maidenly blush , and then deep scarlet in its Sybaritic glory . The Andalusian winter lay calm on the land , and Christopher Columbuswas at El Puerto in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience with Isabel and Ferdinand at the court here in Seville . Aye . ' Vincit qui patitur . Christopher Columbus , with the patience of Job and the dream of Jason , kept one eye on the court of Isabel , awaiting her call , and one eye on the Ocean Sea , awaiting its call , too . But I had eyes only for Maraela . The captains and the soldiers had departed Seville and were thrustinginto Granada against the battlements of Boabdil the Moor , shoutingthe ancient cry of Andalusia , " Trust God and hammer on ! " The bombards and now the lance ! The crossbow and now the sword ! And they died screaming fealty to Santiago and all the saints of Spain , and a salute for the Royal Banner of Isabel 's Castile , a prayer for the Golden Cross of Ferdinand 's Aragon . My emblem was golden , too ; gold and blue and red , her hair , her eyes , her lips . The court had moved to Cordova , eighty miles up the Guadalquivir River , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pimpish largesse of Seville 's nobles and the earthen floors of theBut I feasted on the beauty of Maraela Harana . Torquemada had become Inquisitor-General for all of Spain and old Quemadero burned from the Pyrenees to the Ocean Sea , purifying the souls of conversos by roasting their flesh . My soul burned only for Maraela . On February 2 , the monastery celebrated Candlemas Day , the Purification of the Virgin , and then it was spring again and the little dog rose of Andalusia came to bloom and birds nested in the reeds along the river . It was raining when I took the Wafer that Friday morning , and was storming tumultuously when Fray Juan came to my stall that afternoon , only a few minutes before my weekly respite , before my hour of Paradise with Maraela . He had a copy of Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum under his arm and was eating dried beans again . I feared a visit that might impose upon my leave and eyed the book suspiciously . Fray Juan laid it upon the bench and sat himself beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time or his fellow man 's intent . My breeding , nevertheless , compelled me to ask his health and other matters of polite trivia , including his opinion of the weather , which was discouraging . He answered in monosyllables , as though his mind and tongue were asunder , and there were long , infuriating pauses between his words as his jaw revolved malevolently and his teeth crunched the beans . I was fidgety because the minute for my freedom was nigh and I could not depart Juan Ruiz de Medina without his sanction . In nervous anxiety I snatched for a subject to interest him and asked the latest news of Christopher Columbus , not that I cared a copper blanca about Christopher Columbus . " With Cerda , " Fray Juan said . " Still with Cerda . " " And how is Benjamin Marino progressing with his map ? " I reached for another subject . " Slowly . " He clasped his hands around his knee and looked at the window and at the rain gushing against the stones , hiding the river while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth bellowed her protests in rolling thunder . For a long time he sat thus , and me straining , and then he said , " Runt caelum ! It is droll that Marino himself may be wrong . The earth is larger even than he thinks . " " Aye ? " It was amusing that my fray should challenge the great mapmaker . " That is droll . " I assumed he would not fathom the subtlety of my pun . His eyes left the window and fastened on my face and he smiled . " Benjamin Marino is not the only learned cosmographer in the world . " I detected a yearning , a longing that I should know that he , too , was a man of letters , that this ugly specter and twisted Fury was one of God 's creatures and blessed in mind if denied in body . It was piteously sad and I was closer to him than ever before and could not leave him , even for Maraela , because he was so lonely . " I was sent to the College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to the Dominicans to profit by the knowledge of Fray Juan Ruiz de Medina . " His fleeting pride , yea , sinful pride , was reward for my perjury and he smiled again . " Absolution for that lie is given of God and , therefore , I am spared the truth . And thou , little brother , will forgive my vanity . " He was encroaching upon my time , stealing minutes from my hour of Paradise , but there was naught I could do and he betrayed no intention of going away . Another long pause and he said , " Aye . The earth is larger than Marino believes . Studious men have known since the days of Eratosthenes that the girth of our sphere is z6,000 miles . And Eratosthenes lived three hundred years before Christ . " " A Greek ? " My interest flared immediately . " A Greek . " He nodded methodically . " A Western man , Rodrigo , and hence scorned by Semites . But all knowledge does not come from the East . " He stroked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my floor . " Eratosthenes measured the earth with a rod , a well , a pole , and a shadow . " I leaned forward to catch every word and , seeing my heed , he spat out the bean hulls and wiped a trickle of saliva from the corners of his mouth . " This Greek was a librarian at Alexandria . " He arrayed his facts and recited them . " At Syene , 520 miles from Alexandria , was a well that was lighted to its bottom on the day of the summer solstice . So the sun was directly overhead . " He peered at me , then continued . " Eratosthenes erected a pole at Alexandria and on the day of the solstice he measured the angle of the pole 's shadow . It was 7% degrees . Know you that significance ? " " No , " I said truthfully . " Then we will spend more time on mathematics and less on geography , " he mumbled , grating the words in obvious displeasure . " Aroint ! Even a dullard should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended to the center of the earth they would meet at the same angle , or 7% degrees . Now , how many degrees in a circle ? " " Three hundred and sixty . " " Then the 74-degree angle was ' /loth of a circle . " He bore in like66 67a starving rat that has smelled food . " Hence , the distance between the pole and the well was ' /6oth of the earth 's girth . Multiply the distance , 520 miles , by 5o . " " It comes to 26,000 , " I said . " Exactly . " He held out his left hand and it trembled as he extended his fingers rigidly for emphasis . " The Greek unit of measure was the stadium and we may have erred a trifle in changing the distance into miles . But let Christopher Columbus prattle of the Indies . Let BenjaminMarino scourge his brain for the secrets of the Ocean Sea . I tell you the earth 's circumference is 26,000 miles . " He clinched his fingers into a gnarled fist and struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than one third that distance , even this far north of the Equator , and I am assuming a stingy figure . Hence , west by water , Cathay is at least i 8,000 miles from Spain . " The fires that Teacher Marino had kindled blazed again in me and time was without meaning . " Then Cathay is beyond our reach , " I said . " Westward by water . " " Not at all , Rodrigo . Not at all . " He crossed over to the window and watched the rain , and the wind rustled his mantle and misted rain against his cheeks . " God commanded us to carry the sweet message of His Son to all men . Therefore , nothing is inaccessible , nothing impossible . There is land between here and Cathay and where you find land you will find men . And every man is your brother and his soul is your concern --  " This talk I did not relish . Geography , yes . Theology , no . And again I was vexed that he was poaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Unknown are a bridge to the Known . " He was mumbling again and his face was graven against the window and etched sharp by the lightning . " Marino speaks of islands to the west . And 700 leagues . Beshrew ! There are masses of land out there or else God gave man merely a speck for his habitation . And that land is nearer than we dare believe . Ptolemy knew it and I shall teach it . " His fervor was thoroughly Dominican , the zeal of Savonarola of the same order , who even then was shaking Italy into an ague of reformation . " Eratosthenes , " I repeated the Greek 's name to remember it . " And 26,000 miles . Why has such knowledge been hidden from us , Fray Juan ? " " Nothing is hidden from those who seek . " It was spoken as though the opening of a parable and I resigned myself for a metaphorical harangue , and then he turned his back to the window and his face68was in shadows while his head was lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy of this age is man 's assumption of superiority and his scorn of Antiquity 's knowledge ; our devastating conviction that we share the eldern earth and not its infancy . The Greeks , in many ways , were wiser . " " And how ? " I asked . " We have the blessings of Him dead and risen . They had only the promise . " He left the window and stood by me and his artful eyes mapped my face in the manner of Inquisitors searching the conscience of man for one blemish of heresy . Was Fray Juan testing me ? Were the fingers of the Inquisition feeling for a broken link in my Christian armor ? The ears of the Inquisition against my breast to count the heartbeats of my conformity ? I was bewildered , but I spoke out as an Andalusian and the son of the son of a Goth . " What is this meaning , elder brother ? Why were the Greeks wiser ? Is heathen ignorance the master of Christian wisdom ? " " What a Dominican you would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and I heard clearly what followed and measured the dogmatismfor its meaning ; for he said , " The Greeks bound their gods to events and discoveries . We bind events to our God and suffer the stupefaction of the Philistines . " These words from the Queen 's Inquisitor ! This could be a mesh to ensnare me and immediately , aye , instinctively , I recited my remonstrance . " That is Dissension , Fray Juan . And I call upon you to witness that , at sound of the words , I invoked my protest . " His answer was as calm as a summer dawn in the Sierra de los Santos . " Dissension ? " He tasted the accusation and it obviously was insipid . " You retreat into mild expression , Rodrigo , for my words were heresy . " I stared at him , my mouth gaping and my tongue cloven . This was no artifice of the Inquisition 's cunning . This man was speaking Truth as he knew Truth and was chancing his life to teach me that Truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indict at Quemadero 's tribunal ; the voice of the turtle-dove had loosed the lions in the street . It came to me then why Juan Ruiz de Medina was ever a friar and never a prior , why Torquemada was Inquisitor-General and my tutor was only a lance bearer in the Army of Purification . This man was a Dissenter , one of those Dominicans who , like Savonarola , dared cry repentance and reformation above the ashes of Quemadero 's wrath . He had handed me a quill for his Doomsday Book and I pretended naivete and wanted only to be away from that place of gloom and69wormwood and into the sweet presence of Maraela . " My fray , " I said with measured dignity , " is a man of exquisite discretion whose prudenceI pray to reflect . He also is a man of consummate justice and so , therefore , I presume to remind him that this is Friday afternoon and already much of my respite has passed . " " On a day such as this ? " He flung his arm toward the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather for a brief recess ? " " It is my right , " I said . " You may see your father tomorrow . I grant it . But not today --  " " It is my right , " I repeated firmly . He drew closer to me as though there was something he would say and then , after cogitation , he drew away again and was stern and aloof . " Aye , Rodrigo of Triana . It is your right . " One glance he gave to the Historia Rerum on the bench and another glance he gave to me , and was gone , leaving open the door between my stall and the grilled exit of the monastery . Quickly I pulled my jacket tight around my neck and dashed to the street , and raced to my father 's shop , hugging the walls along the way to shield myself from heaven 's anger of torrent and thunder . My father was not there and the ledger was not on his desk . And the gloom of evening was fast upon the land , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hurried to the back room and old Mudarra was on his knees and scrubbing the floor and this , indeed , a mockery of his pride . He was startled by my sudden attendance , and to conceal his surprise he blurted his acrimony . " What here , Dominican scamp ? Only fools and fish breast this weather . " " Where is my father ? " I was in no mood for his disdain and my voice bespoke my temper . He straightened and hurled the scrub rag into a corner and under the cask . " He went out with Amerigo Vespucci and it is obvious that the storm caught him . " " The ledger is not on the desk --  " " Then he does not want you to take it to Harana . That , too , is obvious , or should be . " He growled the judgment and sat his bench , pumping his wheel furiously and glancing about the floor and then at inc . I returned to the salesroom and sprawled in my father 's chair and was taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was away and my liberty was up and , even if I chose to violate my monasterial duties , 70I had no acceptable excuse to disturb Harana in his own home and thereby see Maraela . But urgencies always sharpened my wits and I opened the desk and there was the ledger and it was posted to that day . I assumed an oversighton my father 's part , that he simply had forgot to leave the book on the desk , yet knowing the assumption was only a balm for my conscience . A fie on conscience ! Bell and book for the monastery and a candle for Fray Juan Ruiz de Medina ! I shoved the ledger under my jacket and walked boldly out of the shop and was aware that Mudarra could not hear my departure above the gush and clatter of the storm and the whirl of his potter 's wheel . The rain beat upon my hunched shoulders and I darted down the narrow alleys and along the riverway to the Street of Felicity . The cymbalshone yellow in the Furies ' celestial lanterns and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder drowned all earthly noises . Again I swung the clapper and again its echo melted into the thunder . Instinctively , and without second thought , I felt for the latch and it loosened , and I stepped into the hallway to call Harana and announce my presence . Mother of Mercy ! My very guts quivered into a nauseous jelly of dismay and I was seized in a spasm of horror . The dining table was adorned by a spotless white cloth and there sat Harana , the prayer shawl of Israel over his head , and Maraela with a taper , lighting the candles and shielding each with her hand in the tradition of Jewish women since the Babylonian exile . Judaizing ! A gust through the open door flickered the candles and she looked up the hallway and saw me , and dropped the taper in paralytic terror . Then Harana saw me and shrieked his lament and snatched her hand . " The door ! You did not bolt the door ! We are lost ! " In his piteous bewilderment he bowed his neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plea for release from his vows ; part wail , part psalm , and all sorrow . Maraela yanked tight the drapes to the dining room and ran up the hall and flung herself on me , scratching and screaming . " Beast of cloven hooves ! Vile seed of Haman ! " Her nails raked my face like the claws of Triana 's prowling cats and I threw up my arms to protect myself and all the while calling her to her senses . " Maraela ! Maraela ! " " Swine and sperm of swine ! Conception of iniquity ! Filth of the71Inquisition ! Dominican spy ! " She spewed the words at me and beat my chest with her sweet hands until I seized her wrists and made myself heard . " Silence , Maraela ! Silence this madness ! " I shook her to free her from the devils that had possessed her . " Your secret is safe . " She stared at me and her eyes were wide in the imploration of her hope and then her eyes were closed and she sobbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held her head to my breast and stroked her hair . " Could I betray my love ? " I asked in staunch resolution . " Could I behead my dreams with treachery 's foul sword and scatter them on the barren ground of my own perfidy ? " My assurance comforted her and I felt the waning convulsions of her terror . " Better that I tear out my own heart and hurl it to the passion of Quemadero than that I should pain the heart of my beloved . " She looked up at me , searching my face , and the panic was gone from her eyes and they were pleading . " Say you this ? " she implored . " This I say . " " Then swear . " " I swear . " Like a frightened bird with a broken wing she darted into the big room and snatched the poniard and sheath from the wall and raised the hilt to my lips . " By this you swear . This , the Cross . " " By this I swear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its admonition : " Trust God and hammer on ! " She thrust it into my hand and rested her head on my shoulder and close to my ear , and whispered , " Then wear it , Rodrigo of Triana , that the Cross of your faith and the steel of your honor may remind you forever of your vow . " And now I was as guilty as she and must share her guilt , for the secret of heresy was as heinous as its practice and the Inquisition tolerated no distinction between information concealed and apostasy done . Her lips touched my ear in a caress of dew and she abandoned herself to my arms , suddenly whimpering and crushing my mouth and biting my cheeks and neck in frenzied bliss . The manliness of my breed scorned place and time and I imprisoned her in my embrace and looked from her to the couch , and she felt my resolve and slipped from the bonds of my rapture . " You must depart . " She opened the door and the rain misted her72hair in glorious adornment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly . " I must attend my father , Rodrigo . Farewell . " She encouraged me through the doorway , gently pushing , and closed the portal and I stumbled down the passageway to the Street of Felicity and the rain smarted my cheeks where her frantic nails had ripped my flesh before she kissed away the pain . My first thought was of my father , to protect him from any knowledgethat his associate was a Judaizing converso , and I concocted a story that Harana had not answered my knock and that I had taken refuge from the storm and had fallen on the cobblestones in my haste to return . Woe the lies of youth . flow foolish the conspiracies of heart and tongue . My father was waiting for me at his desk and one glance dissipated my intent for deception ; the haggard lines of his face and the indictmentof his eyes . Besides , the poniard was at my hip and how could I pretend I had not entered the Harana home . He motioned me to the bench and glanced quickly toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and Mudarra . Some of the dread that I had first noticed on my father 's countenance began to disappear and he said impassively , " Now you know . " I did not reply . I could not . " This I would have spared you , my son . And the sin is mine . " " Yours ? " The poignancy of my question touched him and his visage changed to infinite tenderness . " Aye , mine . " He nodded the verdict . " I have known all along that the Haranas are Christians by day and Jews by night . But I needed Luis and Luis needed me and it might have worked had not the heart of my son and the heart of his daughter become entwined in the mysteryof youth 's first love . " " I should not have gone there tonight . " I sought solace for him in my own condemnation . " The ledger was not here . I opened your desk . " He got up and stood tall before me , he an Andalusian and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodrigo , at the bridgeless chasm you have crossed . I should have been here to forbid your impetuosity . This day is the Feast of Purim , when Jews commemorate their deliverance from Haman , and the fealty of Esther , and the guile of their vengeance on their enemies . " I stood , too , and my head was as high as his and my shoulders as broad . " I have sealed my lips . " The poniard was in my hand and I held it before him . " By this Cross I have sworn . " 73 " Reckless warrant of love 's duress . " He flung up his arms in a gesture of exasperation . " Now you have the stain of their guilt . Even as I. " He took the poniard and its sheath and put them in his desk and looked hard at me again and there was a glint of pride in his eyes . " But by the sky gods of your Gothic forebears , a man is born a man . " He clasped his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of your tutor , of your own confessor , are mirrors for the Inquisition . " I nodded toward the back room and asked , " And what of Mudarra ? " " Mudarra has no tongue for Ouemadero 's ears . Now to your monasteryand we will choose our course on the morrow . Begone in haste , rash youth ! before the tempest of my apprehension rises to the tempest of this night that bedevils us . " I ran all the way to the monastery , panting and stumbling when I reached the door , and it was closed . Vespers had passed and the cloisterswere still and I pounded on the door and Juan Ruiz de Medina clattered free the bolt and let me in . Straightway I went to my quarters , pretending petulance and disgust , and straightway he came to me and put his candle on my bench and studied me in the yellow light of the revealing flame . Then he spake : " You were delayed by the storm , perhaps . It was most violent . " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratches were tender . " And very dark . The streets are slippery and the rose thorns sharp along the way . " Let him think what he would , that I had been brawling or whoring . He reached for the candle and the yellow light was in his yellow eyes . " You will fast tomorrow and remain in your quarters all of next week . Even Friday . " " Yes , my fray . " He stepped into the corridor and there he paused and looked back at me . " Shall I confess thee tonight , little brother ? " " If you choose . " My eyes did not waver . " It is for you to say , Rodrigo of Triana . " " There is no sin on my soul , Fray Juan . " It was a lie to him and not to the Holy Ghost . " Then good night , and peace attend you . " His shuffling footfalls sounded down the corridor and I crept to my straw . The storm was rumbling its death and I lay wild-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meek aurora ; and then to sleep . C H A P T E R 7LL THE NEXT MORNING , IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR MYdereliction , I saw no face , I heard no voice , and soon after the meridian , this being the hour the sun crossed the river , my father came to my stall in attendance with Fray Juan . The Inquisitor 's bearing was obdurate and this troubled me muchly ; my father 's deportment was grim and this troubled me more . After a perfunctory explanation that my durance was punishment for malfeasance Fray Juan left us , and my father 's first admonition was : " Fear not , my son . Fear nothing except thyself . " " Is she all right ? " I implored and kicked straw around the bottom of the door to muffle all sound . " And Harana , also . Are they safe ? " " The Haranas departed Seville this midmorning . " He spoke the verdict without embellishment . " Where ? " My instinctive concern was that precipitative flight might attract suspicion . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbed the fatigue from his brow . " I know not . I did not see Maraela , only Luis , and unselfishly he spared us further knowledge of his plight and plans . " So she was gone , and my only prayer was for her safety . Some day I would find her , and soon , for at the blessed hour of my freedom from this doleful place I would call her name from every mountaintop in Andalusia and whisper my troth through every vale of Spain . " Their departure is evidence of Harana 's discretion . " My lips said it , but my heart said more . Oh , Maraela , flower of my youth . I will find you , and this you know . " Luis is a man of unfaltering wariness , " my father said with the prideful candor of his business training . " He closed his affairs with me in the presence of witnesses most reputable and he and his daughter went forth leisurely . On two fine mules --  " " Mules ! " The word aroused my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75My father 's scowl was arraignment of my slothful speculation . " Naturally , Rodrigo . Think you that my friend is a fool ? Edge your wits , boy . Luis Harana , a converso , did business on this day , the JewishSabbath . He applied for a mule license on this day and departed hastelessly as becomes a gentleman of exemplary repute and unblemishedconscience . " The sagacity of the maneuver was apparent to me then and I bowed submission to my father 's rebuke . " Aye , sir . Harana is a man of unfalteringwariness . " He directed that I sit on the bench by him and put his hand on my knee in the warmth of sodality . " And now for yourself , my son . I am sending you to Lepe . " " To Aunt Ronda ? " My freedom was promised sooner than I had dared hope , and my search could begin while her kisses were still sweet on my lips . " Aye . To my sister . And she will send you to the Franciscans , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even this edict disturbed me not at all . I was to be away from the indefatigable scrutiny of Juan Ruiz de Medina . There would be no opportunity for him to cull my thoughts and thus endanger Maraela , and I could begin my quest in Lepe , for Harana , being a merchant , perchance would travel toward the sea . I strove to conceal my delight and said , " Your wishes are my pleasure . Have you spoken to Fray Juan ? " " I have . He knows of my disassociation with Luis Harana and understandsmy sorrow that my business , henceforth , will not justify your continuance in this college . " He smiled tactfully . " He knows you go to your Aunt Ronda , but I chose not to trouble him with our Franciscan plans in Lepe . " How the stones for the temple of my life fitted one to the other : Christopher Columbus was under the protection of the gray mantles of the Franciscans , Benjamin Marino was in their service , and now Lachesis was casting my lot into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common cause and set our roles in the Odyssean drama that changed the world . Had I been older , or wiser , this hint of coincidence might have impressed itself upon me , but I had no heed for this collusion of circumstances , cultivating my interest wholly upon Maraela , whom I must find , and upon Lepe , which sired the greatest sailors in the world ; Lepe , neighbor of Palos and cousin to Huelva , Lepe of the Ocean Sea . " When do I leave ? " I asked my father , striving manfully to conceal any childish impetuosity . " Monday . This day you will observe your fast . Tomorrow afternoon you will come to my shop for final instructions . And Monday you will take leave . " " By ship or barge ? " " Neither . A company of drovers are taking mules to Lepe . You will accompany them in the employ of one Pedro de Arcos . " ( Arcos , my comrade ! That you were alive to read this . You , the staunch arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous dawn at San Salvador , you who steered our ship into the embrace of the New World and who quailed not at the mystery of the floating meadow . You a mule drover . By the Thirty Pieces , Pedro de Arcos ! You a nursemaid for seedless asses ! ) The name meant nothing to me , but the journey promised adventure as I knew , from hearsay , the overland route to Lepe , the highroad from Seville to La Palma , the gypsies along the way , the night campfires and the river Odiel ; and this venture to be the opening of my quest for Maraela . " Your pay will be a pittance . " My father used his foot to rake the straw from around the door and made ready to take his leave . " Only zoo maravedis and food for the journey . This , however , is of no consequence . The sooner you are beyond the myriad eyes of Juan Ruiz de Medina , the smoother my humors will flow . " His farewell was a handclasp on my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept the fast and supposedly was alone , but I was not alone , for always the image of Maraela was with me and now the contemplation of my journey . Fray Juan brought me a large wooden bowl of soup at twilight and had a small one for himself and sat with me and we supped together , and he ate most ravenously , gurgling his porridge , and it came to me that he , too , had fasted that day and had shared my chastening . Again I felt close to him , and in the shadows of night horning I could not see his repulsive face , but only feel his presence , the strength of him near . And then he spake and his words were as gentle as the fringes of twilight , of dayspring to come . " There is more soup , little brother . " So sweet , so compassionate , and the miracle of such tenderness from the cavernous jaws of the Queen 's Inquisitor . The latent nobility of my own spirit , the benediction of my own76 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I spake goodly in this manner , and bless the moment : " I will have more only if my brother shares my plenty . " Juan Ruiz de Medina wept and his eyes glistened tears in the last light of day , and then instantly he was himself again and walked out and soon I heard his bare feet shuffling back up the corridor , and his steps were lighter than ever before . He had two large bowls of soup in his hands and these he put on the bench and fumbled in his habit and drew therefrom a new candle , two oranges , two onions , a handful of dates and , praise all saints , two pieces of bread soaked in honey . This contraband , these prizes , he arrayed before me and his eyes danced the mischief of a culprit in empyrean . " And now , Rodrigo of Triana , lay to . " His handclasp on my shoulder was as warm , as strong , as my father 's had been . " And remember always that the hospitality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we feasted . Then he lit the candle and the cell was cheerful , and us with full bellies and the light bright and warm . It was I , in the camaraderie of the spell , who first mentioned my departure from the college and for a painful instant I thought Fray Juan was going to offer me the facilities of the school without tuition or cost and thus create further complications . I should have known better . I should have known that he was too wise and too sensitive to offend the pride of an Andalusian by a tender of charity . His only comment was : " Your father confided in me . " " I have never been to Lepe , " I said , a sop of the bread in my mouth and the honey oozing sweet in my throat . Fray Juan licked the honey from his fingers and stared at the candlelightas though his lips hungered to say things that his vows forbade . " It is only a few miles from the Portuguese border , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be many temptations , even before you go to sea . " " To sea ? " I , too , stared at the candle and then up at him . " I am not going to sea . " " If you go to Lepe , you go to sea . It is always thus . " " But not I , Fray Juan , " I protested . " I am going to my Aunt Ronda and when things are better I will return to Seville and enter my father 's business . " Slowly he shook his head . " If you go to Lepe , you go to sea . It is as natural as breathing , as inevitable as death . " He watched the wax78spill down the length of the candle and reached for a daub of the stuff and rubbed it between his fingers . " I regret I will not be here on the morrow to bid you God 's blessings . " Now this was an invitation for inquiry , a notice that he had something to say that he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good breeding dictated that I must expose interest . Such is the subtlety of manners in Andalusia . " You will not be here tomorrow ? " It was a conflictof statement and query . " And it the holy Sabbath . " " I go to Cordova , " he said . " To the court of the Queen . " And then as an afterthought , he affixed these words : " And , thereby , to the court of the King also . " It was a sly aspersion , not in the expression at all , but only in the tone . The court of Ferdinand and Isabel had been in Cordova for several weeks , he to lead the campaign against Granada and she to gather into her saintly hands all the reins of the Inquisition . There was more to the trend of his conversation than appeared on the surface and I probed a bit , skillfully , to be sure , and without any evidence of curiosity . " To Cordova and the court ? Are the duties of the Inquisition so stringent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at me in fastidious approval . " It is not the Inquisition , Rodrigo . It is a matter most pertinent . " The wax between his fingers was shaped into a ball and this he put into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully . " Christopher Columbus of our earlier lectures arrived in Seville this morning , and departed this afternoon for Cordova . " This was news most savory ; intelligence I should pass to my father if he knew it not . " To audience with the Queen ? " I asked . " Has this Columbus the ear of our blessed Majesty ? " " No . " He touched his hand to the candle and the flame seemed not to pain him . " But he has letters from Cerda and from Franciscans to several persons of most singular repute , and these include Alonso de Quintanilla and Luis de Santangel . " My ears tingled my excitement and , still , there was a foreboding in my preserving caution . Why should I , a youth , have the confidence of an Inquisitor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to me ? Alonso de Quintanilla was Contador Mayor , which is to say Treasurer of the Realm , and Luis de Santangel  --  woe the name  --  Luis de Santangel was the King 's Minister of Finance and the most powerfulconverso in Spain . One of his kinsmen had gone to the stake for conspiring against the Inquisition and for the murder of an Inquisitor , 79but Luis de Santangel was the King 's trusted confidant . He was a converso trusted and Luis Harana was a converso suspected , and this was ground I did not care to trod . " Does one skilled in the ways of intrigue trust these matters to the ears of youth ? " I asked boldly . " I do , " he replied without quibble . " Does Juan Ruiz de Medina use his brother as bait for Quemadero 's passion ? " I demanded in temper . " I do , " he replied forthrightly . " Then speak , Juan Ruiz de Medina , and the conscience of Rodrigo of Triana will adjudge thy command and weigh it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken ! " His face lighted his pleasure . " Now hear me . At Lepe is the Franciscan monastery of Santa Maria de los Remedios . I am no dolt . Your father has dreams for you and hopes that your educationis furthered . So where except at Santa Maria de los Remedios ? " I was pinned to the mast and , yet  --  witness all  --  I did not squirm , neither blink an eye , but answered in utmost prudence , " My fray has knowledge that is denied me . " He was all friar again , all master , and the camaraderie was dissipated . " What a Dominican you would make . " He almost whispered it and then spoke out . " Students have keys that teachers can not hold . I remind you that the path of Christopher Columbus leads always from Franciscans to conversos . If you attend the monastery , and you will , I ask you to sleep not --  " " And report to you an explanation for this affinity between Christopher Columbus , the Franciscans , and conversos ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accosted him most valiantly . " I request , sir , the honor of unfettered perspicuity between you and me . " " I only ask that you sleep not , " he repeated . " You ask that I observe the intent and practices of the Franciscans and inform you of my findings . I say to you , sir , that coverture is repugnant to my healthy nostrils . Do you dare challenge the probity of the Friars Minor ? " He threw back his head and laughed in a manner most hilarious , a really unseeming merriment for a caelebs in Holy Orders . " Aroint ! And crow fiercely my Andalusian cockerel . Have we , the Dominicans , suckled our student on verbosity ? " He wiped his eyes on his mantle and fixed his penetrating gaze upon me . " One minute you speak as a man , the next as a child . " He hitched himself closer to me and tapped my8oknee with his bony finger . " It is never the probity of the Minorites that harasses me , but their prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different flavor and I smiled at recollection of my own bravado . Fray Juan obviously perceived my thoughts and his eyes sparkled merriment again . " The conversos , Rodrigo , are the richest group in Spain and the Franciscans have a key to their purse . I am weary of this Dominican college struggling on a pittance while the Franciscans have plenty . I want a chair of map making for this school . A chair of Arabic . I want the secret of Franciscan tenure on the moneybags of conversos so I may emulate them . " " That , sir , " I said in undisguised relief , " is a wine of another vintage , and none of the bitter dregs of loathsome duplicity . My service is at your command . " I was desirous suddenly of ending this talk of conversosfor fear his inquisitive genius might lead to the Haranas . " I ask only that you remain aware . " He stretched his hands in exasperation that I should misconstrue his motive . " I know that students gossip and that young ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with honor , why converso sesame is so ready for Franciscantouch , then I ask you to share this knowledge with me , and thusly your Dominicans can swarm around the converso comb and perhaps find some honey for our cause . " He doubled his fist and pounded the bench so hard that the candle shook and spluttered . " I will do any honorable service to build this college into a university . " I , too , struck the bench to emphasize my enthusiasm , a feigned assurance that I did well . " It will be a privilege to serve Seville , " I said , and this a promise that I had no intention whatsoever of keeping . Fray Juan gave every indication of contentment and , upon my soul , began querying me on the wisdom of Isidore , the theorems of Erbtosthenes , and divers and sundry matters that he had taught me . He burrowed into my mind like a mole and wheedled and needled until my senses reeled under the constancy of his intellectual aggression . Then he relented , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Franciscans and the world will not find you a vacuous idiot . What --  " he jabbed his long finger into my chest and barked . " What is the most important thing I have taught you ? " Without hesitation I spake up : " Vincit qui sevincit . " " Bravo ! " He exclaimed his approval . " He conquers who conquers himself . And next ? " " That the world is larger than we think . " " Good , Rodrigo . It is spoken in the scholarship of thy brothers and8rthe grace of thy God . " He pushed the candle to the far end of the bench and touched the tips of all of his fingers together and chewed his lower lip in contemplation . " The urn is turned , little brother . The bowl is thrown . Search the stars of thy immortality and weep never for the clay at thy feet . Prattle not the beauty of truth with thy tongue if there be a lie in thy heart . " He put his arm around my shoulders and his counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except friendship and this to be paid with interest . Count never your purse among your jewels . Your mercy for all men . Touch not a maiden without troth and cherish thy begats as vessels shaped by thy own hands . That is all . " He stood and I , too , arose , and he lifted the candle and stepped to the door and there he turned and smiled his farewell . " And now , Rodrigo of Triana , trust God and hammer on ! " My fray was gone before I could shape a reply to my tongue and this discomforted me as there were things I needed to speak , my esteem and laudation , my gratitude to Juan Ruiz de Medina  --  Dominican , Inquisitor , teacher ; lonely man of the midnight office , lance bearer in the army of his Lord . My eyes were heavy but I could not sleep . My straw was clean but I could not rest . The night whispered in my window and her name was on every zephyr , Maraela of golden hair , Maraela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , turning the glasses , and the lookouts called the ridings of the peaceful hour . My city , my Seville , slept the serenity of her venerable years and never again was i to see her in this mood , the tranquility of Sabbath borning , the awakening of the bells , the spring swelling her breasts in motherly abundance , and I , her son , filled with love for my fellow man and the sweet hopes of youth . ( Seville  --  my Andalusia . Tread of the Phoenicians , trod of the Goths . Do the stars still cradle in the spire of San Marcos ? Is the blue haze over thy river yet ? Does the sun still rise from thy meadow and shadow behind the Castle of Triana ?

Vanish these fires of memory and leave me with the ashes of my desolation. ) 82C H A P TER 87C ) ' HE HOLY SABBATH WAS TURNING ITS OWN GLASS INTO THElong afternoon when I stepped from the portal of the monastery and blinked in the radiant light of my emancipation , then wended downthe quiet streets to my father 's shop . Old Mudarra was on the corner of the alley and purloining glancesat the women passing , and making ribald gestures and jests to thosewho raised their eyes to his licentious appraisement . I saw him before he saw me and he spoke to me while his gaze followed a slut down the way , her bracelets jangling the tocsin of her trade and her buttocksweaving an invitation to her couch . " Ho ! Young goat that seeks fresh pastures . " The puta had vanished around the corner and reluctantly he gave me his attention . " So the Dominican shackles are smitten from your brain , and from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no mood for buffoonery , Mudarra . Is my father in hisshop ? " " In no mood for buffoonery , he says . " The irascible Morisco cackledhis disdain and bowed low to me in mockery . " And this the feast day ofhis benighted convictions --  " " Swallow your blasphemy , seedless ram , " I said in tempestuous harshness . " At times your toothless gums and wrinkled brow are the onlyarmor that protects you from my ire . " Old Mudarra jumped up and down in frenzied agitation . " Seedlessram , he says . Hear him , Messenger of Allah . Hear the yelp of this pup fresh from the den of Dominican eunuchs . Christian vanity ! Andalusianarrogance ! May his feeble saints wean him from the pap ofAquinas and the heresy of his barbarian forebears . " " Enough ! By the withered cods of your lecherous prophet , enough ! " I seized his shoulder in a grip that was firm but by no means rough . " I have long wearied of your sneers for my race and my faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is patriotism most valiant . A Jew chants the glory of his ancient Zion and that is83tradition most blessed . But if an Andalusian raises his voice to the glory of his Cross and the sanctity of his hearth , then that is the hollow whine of a native fool . Away with such Semitic inanity . Now , where is my father ? " I released his shoulder and his sunken old eyes blazed his judgment of me and he reached out and grabbed my arm and felt its strength and looked me over from my heavy leather shoes to the wool stockingcapslanted on my head . " You are ready , " he muttered . " By the flourishing fields of The Messenger , you are ready . Amir el bahr . Your father awaits your presence . " He turned from me and slouched up the alley . " Mudarra ! " " Aye ? " His face came around to me . " Do you know whither she has gone ? " All the anger was out of my voice . Iie pulled his burnoose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crest of his turban . " I am the blood of Abraham , young Spaniard . The breed of Ishmael . Know you the story of the water glass and the drop of oil ? " " I know it --  " " Then remember it forever , Rodrigo . And forget Maraela Harana . " He swung his back to me and trudged down the alley where the brothels stretched to the river and the putas lolled in the sun , while their enterprising sisters , the rameras , hawked in the street and , for two maravedis , sold themselves under the wharves . If the buyer had no money , a crust of bread would seal the bargain , and a loaf would buy a virgin , if one could be found in the squalor of Seville . The door to my father 's shop was closed and the shutters drawn , this clay being the Lord 's , but he answered my knock and admitted me into the stale gloom of his mart and , as my eyes accustomed themselves to the shadows , I saw the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine and a tankard were within easy reach , and then I was presented to Pedro de Arcos . As sturdy as a mountain jack was Arcos , his sandy eyebrows shaggy like the bristles of an angry boar and his black eyes squinting and darting and never still . He weighed me like a trader in the mule market and spake clearly his approval . " So this is the Bermejo colt I take to Lepe . Well , Vicente --  " He lifted his tankard and drank his endorsement . " He has got salt in his guts and good bile for his humors . A stalwart son is a father 's sweetest blessing . " 84 " I thank you , Arcos . " My father beamed his pride and clapped his hand on my shoulder in a gesture most manly and hearty . Then he poured a tankard for himself and one for me and I joined that company of men and although the monastery was only minutes away it already seemed hours , and I was drawn to Pedro de Arcos as the needle is drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a fault acquired and not inherited . " I touched my tankard to his . " But you are not a stranger in Seville . I have seen you before --  " " Rodrigo ! " My father snapped my name . " In these days no man has ever seen another man before . " My cheeks tingled my embarrassment and Arcos laughed . " Clear the scuppers , Vicente . The boy speaks forthrightly . " His eyes darted from my father to me . " You have seen me before ? " " If you say I have , sir , I have . " My instinctive caution had possessedmy faculties again . " How close have you been to hell ? " " Close enough , " I answered immediately and thus proving that my wits and levity were as sharp as his . My father chuckled his accord and Pedro de Arcos drew his brows together in a scowl most fierce and poked my chest with his stubby forefinger , and I saw the calluses thereon and the tar under his nail . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayhaps you have seen me there . " He was a bit drunk and his words gurgled in his throat . " A sailor , " I said in obvious envy . " Now I know . I have seen you on the ships . " " Incredible wisdom . " He laughed uproariously . As I have told you before , and it bears repeating , I was never one to scorn jeers or accept ridicule . My father was watching me and I spake clearly , albeit with no umbrage but firmly nevertheless . " This raucous mirth opens the door to friendship , or folly . Do Andalusian sailors drive mules ? " He cocked his right eye at me like one of the parakeets the seafarers sometimes fetched from Guinea . " In these days , spurless cockerel , Andalusia 's sailors do anything they can to take the slack out of their bellies . The seas belong to Portugal while our Ferdinand spends his realm 's strength against the Moors and his own sperm into the cold belly of Isabel . " " Sir , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , she is a fool . " He pounded his tankard on the desk . " Not as insane as that witless Joanna she has breached , but a witling in her85 own right . She convorts with conversos and consorts with saints while Spain 's caravels rot at their moorings . " I might have replied , but my father shook his head at me and we let Arcos have his say . " I herded horses from Palos to Seville and now I drive mules back to Lepe . I , Pedro de Arcos , the best helmsman of Rio Saltes . " He pushed the flagon aside and got up . " I will see you to Lepe and safe in the arms of your estimable aunt , whose betrothed was my comrade . We leave at dawn . " He drained his tankard and nudged his elbow into my father 's ribs . " And as for you , Vicente , I will be on the lookout for aloes if ever I get my hand on a tiller again . " He flung open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calling : " One glass is gone and another flows ; It all shall run down if God so wills . " We heard him to the street and toward the river and there was a silence between us and I spake first , " Then he knows my Aunt Ronda ? " " Aye . Since childhood . " My father picked up the tankards and took them back to the water cask in Mudarra 's workshop and washed them . " Never argue with a man after the third cup , Rodrigo , " he counseled me . " Fight him if you must . Ignore him if you can . But never argue . " He put the tankards on a shelf and dried his hands under the armpits of his doublet . " All is ready . You will spend this night at your home in Triana and at dayspring you leave the nest . " " I-Iave you not forgotten something , sire ? " " I have not forgotten . " He opened his desk and took out the poniard and himself buckled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It was not one of my studies at the College of Seville , " I said . " You will learn . But until you do , mind your tongue lest you lose it , and your temper lest you are brought bloodless back to me . Now we go . " I hooked my thumb under the belt of my poniard in a manner most proud and dashing . " But Mudarra , " I reminded him . " I must tell Mudarra farewell . " " He has asked the privilege of accompanying you to the corral to- morrow where you will join Arcos . I granted his wish as I am not one for lingering farewells . " One quick survey he made of the shop , sniffing the air and peering 86 87into the corners , and then he opened the door and we went out in the sunshine ; and me most puffed up to be at his side , her Toledo poniard on my hip and the promise of adventure that I was sure would lead me to her . The strollers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father swept his hat and hand into a graceful greeting to some worthy personage , and I , too , bowing even more elaborately than he , my left arm wide from my body lest it conceal the blade . We , crossed the bridge to Triana and to our home and my heart pulled the melancholy humors into my fancy when I saw the things endeared to my childhood and reminisced that on the morrow I would put these scenes behind me . My father , sensing my sadness and strivingto hide his , set out a repast of wine and honey and cakes , and a jar of that devilish brew called coffee , the smuggled qahwah of Arabia and prohibited in Christian countries because its intoxicating mystery came not from grapes . At sundown some of our neighbors came avisiting and enlivened the occasion with song and story . They remained to sup and together we sang the Salve Regina and together we repeated our prayers and then my father and I were alone once more , and the night come , and Ito my pallet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood looking down at me , and knelt and stroked my hair and gently kissed my forehead . I lay still , pretending sleep , and when he was gone my tears cleansed my eyes and my resolve cleansed my conscienceand enflamed my ambition to noble endeavor that the name of Bermejo would be honored forever . This was the only tribute I could pay my father for the gift of manhood , the only ransom for my freedom . Again the ancient calls from the river , the all 's well of the night watch and I lapsed into sound slumber . My father 's touch awakened me and I scarcely could believe that it was dawn , but the east was graying and the river was stretching into life . We broke our fast by candlelight , and each of us quiet in the sorrow of my going forth , and then Mudarra came with a long staff in his hand and a most doleful expression on his wizened countenance . My father embraced me , and Mudarra turned away , and my father kissed me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blessings of thy sainted mother attend thee , and the good wishes and love of thy neglectful father . " I followed old Mudarra down the steps and up the street and his staff tapped the cobblestones as we walked , and him in the reverie of the hour and me sadly contemplative and no longer exuberant at the promise of the journey . We reached the outskirts of Triana and I was not aware that Mudarra had extracted my poniard from its sheath and then I saw it in his hand as he balanced it delicately , examining its beauty and appraising its temper . " A weapon for women , " he growled . " But it will serve the hand of a master . Your father asked that I explain the poniard . " " It is a beautiful weapon , " I said heatedly . " A stone is better . " He tested the point against his thumb . " Now , hear you and no argument , for the first time you hurl this blade I will not be there to guide your arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To thrust , hold the wrist firm and strike below the chest bone and down to the heart . Or to the belly and up , but always the wrist firm and the shoulder will perform the chore . " In a twinkle , he had flipped the blade and the point was between his thumb and forefinger . " To hurl , loosen the wrist . This you will practice . Now vow . " " I will practice , " I said . " Firm wrist for thrust , loose wrist for throw . " He returned the knife to me and grumbled again . " Would that you had the brave scimitar of Islam at your side instead of that trinket . " We reached the corrals of Seville , the stinking slaughterhouses at the edge of the meadow and along the river , and the place a confusion of animals and the cries of drovers . Mudarra led the way , scattering sheep with his staff and avoiding swine as though they were devils , which he believed they were . Our company was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cork oak , and Pedro de Arcos shouted the morning 's greetings and presented me to my fellows . I will not detain you , indulgent reader , with the names and descriptions of these ruffians , as they take no part in my narration ; only one , and this one Gomez Rascon , called The Rabbit . I was fascinated immediately by Rascon , for he was about my age although not nearly my height and his structure was somewhat like that of Mudarra 's water cask , a barrel body on short , spindly shanks . His left arm was withered and his right arm was bent and there was a loathsome lump on his shoulder where broken bones had knotted into misshapen ugliness . His mouth came to a pucker when he breathed and his face resembled that of a rabbit , elongated from his enormous88ears to his tiny nose that clung like a withered button to the contour of his visage . Yet , it was the most wistful face I had ever seen . ( Ah , Rascon , my comrade , my right arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rabbit , to hear you call the hour again , and the Unknown Sea swishing under Arcos ' tiller and the floating meadow lapping our brave Pinta . Unbend the mizzen ! Put your back into it ! Lace on the bonnet ! Call it out , forgotten jester in the drama of time ! We are almost there . Adelante ! Adelante ! ) I beseech you , kind reader , to forgive an old man his digressions , the moments I steal from you to pamper my memory of things that mean so much to me , if nothing to you ; the wheedling voice of Christopher Columbus until his anger surged , the bright , bold eyes of Alonso Pinzon , and Arcos ' muscles straining at the tiller as we parted the Ocean Sea into the wake that the lesser breeds followed . So forgive me , and we return to Gomez Rascon , called The Rabbit . His knife was in a sheath of untanned leather , which was held high on his waist by a rawhide thong so his bent arm could reach it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not fine Toledo like mine , but inferior Damascus made by twisting strips of steel together and welding them into a blade . He was staring at my poniard , either in envy or admiration , when Mudarra bade me farewell and put his hands on my shoulders and said : " Assalamu alaik . " Rascon 's face underwent a hideous convulsion at sound of the Arabic and he spat his contempt . " Moslem filth . Is Quemadero a stranger in Seville --  " " Hold , you gnome ! " I spun and faced him and clenched my fists and gave no thought at all to my knife . " One more insult of your betters and I will bury you in a swine wallow where you were born . " His mouth gaped his incredulity and he stared at me in amazement , and over at Arcos , and Arcos held up his hand for silence , and spake his command : " Clear the scuppers , Rabbit . " Rascon 's knife flashed by my face and into the cork oak , and the hilt vibrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and my heart contracted into a hard knot , for I knew this was his warning , his pennant flying before battle . I breathed deeply to master my awe into composure and felt the eyes of them all and cringed inwardly in my dilemma . Then Mudarra swung his staff and it swished under the noses of Arcos and The Rabbit and , disdainfully , he turned his back to them89and stepped to the tree , and there he flipped the knife free with his stick and tossed it to the feet of Gomez Rascon . " Your blade , young master . " He was calling me master , an indicationto all that I was superior to him in every way , in every thing , and I lifted out my poniajd and tossed it to him . He whirled and threw and the dagger pierced the cork bark within an inch of where The Rabbit 's had been , and the hilt hummed the vibration of the jaculation . Arcos ' eyebrows came together in amazement and The Rabbit actuallybeamed his commendation , his lips puckering rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed his leave-taking . " Assalamu alaik . " He said it loud for them all to hear , for the battle pennant of Mudarra was flying , too . " Do not begin your journey , young master , with the blood of your comrades on your hands . " He pushed his staff into the crook of my arm . " This is the tool and weapon of drovers . And now , farewell . " He spat at The Rabbit 's feet and cleared his throat and spat at the feet of Arcos , then walked away and the majesty of his going left the company speechless ; a silence that Rascon broke by a childish giggle of pleasure at the skill and daring he had witnessed . It was he who extracted my weapon from the tree and presented it to me . " This rightfully is the best poniard in our midst . " His voice was thin and reedy , like a child 's . " Perhaps the best in all Andalusia . " " Your excellent judgment belies your station , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must speak boldly as these reckless coves would translate Christian forgiveness and gentlemanly behavior into personal weakness . " And this staff --  " He reached for it and balanced it and returned it to me . " It is the best in Andalusia ? " " It will serve me , " I said . " And you are the best mule drover in Andalusia ? " " I am no drover at all . That art I will learn from you . " All the company laughed and Arcos the loudest of all , and The Rabbit giggled again and addressed his petition to our leader . " If it pleases you , Pedro de Arcos , I will fare with this man . " " That you will , " agreed Arcos , " and I , too . And , now , to the jour-ney . " There were nine men in our company and we were divided into groups of three and each group to tend fifteen mules , to water them twice daily and at night feed them the fodder they carried on their backs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the90other drovers , we set forth on the road from Triana to Lepe , ' I'hc Rabbit and I together and me nudging the mules with my staff to keep them stepping spritely and in line . The dust caked my face and cracked my lips . Rascon allowed me to work myself into a froth and then grinned his good-natured disapproval of my energetic attention to the brutes . " Do not nudge them . " He gestured lassitude with his bent right arm . " If they walk fast , we walk fast . They will follow the bell . " He motionedtoward the lead mule of our fifteen , around whose neck a bronze bell tingled . " The lovely buttocks of rich maidens will some day warm the backs of these beasts . Would that we were mules , eh , Lepe ? " It was The Rabbit who first called me Lepe because that was the town to which I journeyed , and because it was a simple name and one which a comrade is apt to bestow affectionately . And this , sirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that attend my role in the various journals of The Discovery ; the accounts of which , incidentally and only thirty-seven years after the fact , already are confusing scholars and courts , who , in reconstructing the miracle , insist upon associating known results with imagined causes , a common failing of literary and legal minds , and who seem determined to forget that Christopher Columbus digested his food like any other man . Hence , the sundry records , authentic or forged , list me under three names while the perusers exhaust their wits to confound a matter that really is quite simple . The Juan Rodrigo Bermejo , the Rodrigo of Triana , and the Lepe of varying documents are the same man , and he is I ; the Christian name of Bermejo , the birthplace being Triana , and the nickname of Lepe , given to me by Gomez Rascon , who was at my side that glorious morn when I saw it and screamed the tidings to him . We had traveled only a few miles before I knew enough about The Rabbit to envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gromet , which is to say a ship 's boy , who was tending mules to keep belly and backbone together because the ways at Palos and Cadiz were swarmingwith idle shipbuilders and sailors . Like Arcos , he was a native of Palos and his withered arm had been his Cross since birth , but the shoulder lump came from bones broken in a shipwreck off Cabo Villano , and this he accepted with a mariner 's Stoicism as he had been going to sea since he was nine . He had never heard of Christopher Columbus or Benjamin Marino and thought all Jews should be fed to Quemadero or exiled from Spain. 91My own knowledge was a wellspring of delight to him and he questionedme slyly about many things : the Pole Star , the circumference of the earth , and the proper way to request the transitory favors of wellbredmaids . This I did not know , and that he did not believe . We paused at high noon long enough to rest the mules and ourselves and the dearth of journeyers on the road surprised me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel was restrictedon land as well as on sea . There were no gypsy wayfarers to amuse me , and The Rabbit , leeringand wholly misconstruing my interest in the Romanys , pointed out that gypsy women fled the empty purses and bestial lusts of drovers while their menfolk hid in the woods to escape impressment into Ferdinand 's army . The Merchants ' Post passed us in midafternoon , the rider on an Arabian horse and so exalted in his own pomposity that he deliberately rode among us and scattered our mules and then was off in a cloud of dust while Rascon hurled rocks at him and cursed his forebears as far back as the brood sow that dropped his grandmother on a dung heap ; and such grandiose fulminations I had never heard before . We reached the corrals of La Palma , a healthy league from the town , at twilight , and the place teeming with cattle and drovers bound north to Badajoz , and we made camp by a stream and tended our animals and then supped on cold mutton and onions . The campfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I , attended by The Rabbit , went among the camps and asked discreetly if any man had heard the whereabouts of one Luis Harana , merchant . Perhaps he had come this way , journeying to the sea , and he had promised me employment . The drovers answered me in surly maledictions and all in the negative , and one tried to steal my poniard and The Rabbit kicked him in the groin and I laid open his scalp with my staff , and this in a manner most neat and deserving , and we ran back to our own camp . Rascon , seeing me discouraged and dejected , did not ask the cause , neither did he pry concerning Luis Harana , but disappeared for an hour and returned with two females , both exceedingly plump and exceedingly malodorous . He offered me my choice and was puzzled by my refusal , for to The Rabbit a woman was a woman , a doctrine I envied but could not practice ; never with Maraela 's kisses a remembranceupon my lips . I saw her that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campfire and , upon rising , I saw her in the dawn and then my imagery92faded into the dust of the road , the grime , the heat , and the monotony of mule rumps . In La Palma and in San Juan del Puerto , I asked of Luis I larana and vacant stares and shaking heads were my only rewards , and by the time we reached Cartaya I was convinced that they had not come this way but probably had gone east toward Cordova or northeasttoward Madrid . My discouragement was heavy upon me and even the antics of The Rabbit did not cheer me . " I will get you a gypsy , " he said , assuming the cause of my gloom and promising a remedy that was hard to find . " But women are women , Lepe . All except Turks . " He touched his grimy hand to his puckish lips and blew a kiss into the air . " Moslem women dignify love into the art that it is . And Jewish women , also . " I resented his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a converso and a Judaizer . On the fourth day from Triana , we hove into the corrals of Lepe and turned our mules over to the trader , who paid our wages and grumbled direly that men should expect zoo maravedis merely for driving animals eighty miles . He tried to deduct for our keep and Arcos ' eyebrows bristled together and he scowled in the dealer 's face , and we were paid in full . Our company was disbanded and Arcos , Rascon , and I walked towardtown and came to a bluff that overlooked the Valley of the Odiel and the Bay of Lepe . The river veered southeast to Huelva and the bay was fed only by the sea ; the Ocean Sea that elbowed into the Gulf of Cadiz and the water arm of Lepe . The sea was beyond my vision , but the bay glistened and the gulls called , and there was a strange tug at my heart . I know now that the sea bewitched me the moment I first saw the Bay of Lepe , that it lured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sat under a tree , Arcos , Rascon , and I , and were silent and knowing our journey had ended . Arcos , picking his teeth with a straw , broke the spell , saying : " I go home to Palos . I have heard you talk , Lepe " ( for now he called me Lepe , too ) " and know that you are a hidalgo and a student of books . I have a fat wife in Palos and a foal of my own , a son of eight years . " " A son ? " I asked . One always is envious of a man with a son . " Three daughters and one son . " He nodded his head slowly . " This son I can not send to the friars , as I have no money . But if you are ever in Palos , I will steal a few blancas , if necessary , to pay you to tutor my son . " 93 " Thank you , Arcos , " I said , and his offer stored itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that minute , for my eyes were on the bay and my mind was calling up the words of Juan Ruiz de Medina  --  " If you go to Lepe , you go to sea . " The Rabbit used his poniard to scrape mud from his sandals . " I , too , go to Palos . I have neither wife nor foals , that I account . If the ships are idle and there are no beasts to drive , you can find me at the wineshop of Francisco Gallego , whose daughter shares my pallet because her father beats her . " He glanced up quickly as a thought awakened a memory . " For that matter , so do I. But that is different , eh , Lepe ? " I thanked him , too , and gave him my staff and we walked down from the bluff and into the town and passed the statue to Our BeautifulVirgin and to the home of my Aunt Ronda Bermejo . She welcomed me with fuss and coos and allowed Arcos to kiss her blushing cheek , but eyed The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes and we talked for an hour or so and then my comrades left us and went out the road to Palos , Arcos anxious to be home and The Rabbit ogling every woman he passed . They scarcely were beyond sight ere Aunt Ronda was plying me with questions about my father . " I received a letter from him by Merchants ' Post , " she said . " It is a relief to me that Harana is no longer associated with your father . Good riddance , I say . Holy Water and the blessed Eucharist will never make Christians of Jews . " " I thought perhaps --  " I was feeling my way . " I thought perhaps Harana came this way . " " Why do you concern yourself ? " she demanded . " Aloes , Aunt Ronda . Harana has a source for aloes , even the Medusaof Mauretania , which is the most valuable of all . " She lifted her bulk from her chair and glowered down at me . " A converso to Lepe ? Never , Rodrigo . The Franciscans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She patted my cheek and the scowl left her face . " We will eat chicken this night . And bread by my own hands . " " You honor me beyond my desert . " " You are my only brother 's only son , and now a man . I have been baking for two days , since your father 's letter that you were coming . " She stepped back and looked at me , her head cocking from side to side . " The last time I saw you there was a velvet doublet . " The words probed a memory that was painful . " Did I not tell you --  " She was not sensitive enough to feel my94misery and loneliness . " Did I not say that you would outgrow it within the year ? Why , now , it would not meet around your waist where you wear that poniard with such elegance . Whence came that ? " " It is a Harana gift , " I said in a tone that indicated the subject was closed . She stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said no more about it . The chicken was fat and tender and I had two glasses of wine , the biting , bitter wine of the sea country and we sat at table and I answeredquestions until my lids drooped and the candle itself splutteredwearily as it burned itself away . She showed me to a back room and my pallet and the straw was fresh and a flaxen cover was handy for my use . She felt the straw and fluffed it as is the wont of women and then fetched a jar of water and a bowl and waited without while I cleansed myself and crawled onto the pallet and pulled the cover to my chest , and sighed the luxury of the minute . Aunt Ronda came in and kissed ' me good night and said , " Tomorrowyou will go to the monastery . It is only a mile from here and near the bay . The blessed Franciscans will sweeten your humors and rid your heart of that Dominican gloom , and set your feet to the path they should trod . " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the house was still and I heard the night sounds of Lepe ; the calls of fishermen hauling in , the calls of lookouts on the caravels , and they were deeper calls , freer calls than those of Seville . The stars were so bright seaward that they shared my room , the wind steady from the bay and the gulf and the mystery beyond . I called her name and the stars mocked me and then I lulled myself to sleep with the beauty she loved so much , the sad lines of Alhakem : I know not how it chanced that the fierce flame Of that atrocious grief consumed me not . Maddening I asked , " W here is my light of Love ? My heart 's sole treasure , where ? " Yet there in truth , There didst thou lurk . Aye , in my heart of hearts , Where thou art ever ; Pole Star of my life , Soul of my soul . Mine own ! Mine own Maraela ! 95C H A P T E R 9WAS AT NO TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not even visit the monastery on my first morning in Lepe , but , forsooth , pursued comportment most desultory and this being witness of two faults that have harassed me all of my years ; respectively , procrastination and daydreaming . At dawn 's coming , I set forth from my aunt 's abode in honest resolution to go directly to the friars and then the lodestone of my destiny seduced my intent and set my course toward the water front , an understandable delinquency inasmuch as I never before had seen a water front of the Ocean Sea . The harbor itself was serene , the water lapping a grayish foam onto the beach and into the docks , and fishing craft rode the swells in rhythmical beauty . There was a score or more of these vessels , all at furl and riding the tide , for Lepe , as you know , is a port of excellent activity in the tuna and sardine trade and a gateway from Portugal both by land and by sea . A caravel was crawling up the bay and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time took no toll of my memory and gave no warning of its own deplorable inconsistency , its flight through minutes pleasurable and its lag through hours monotonous . The ship was lateenrigged and , as I watched , a capricious wind sprang up from the gulf and the caravel scudded before it and was brought about gallantlyinto a port tack with the wind abeam and lay to in a procedure most seamanly , and the watch doubled that she could claw off if the variable winds shifted leeward ; and this execution running at least six sandglasses , or three hours , and me in a childish captivation like any dry-foot who had never dogged a watch . The master and two seamen came ashore as soon as feasible , the master to report his manifest to his agent and the sailors to chart the vicinity for the recreation that men usually seek after a few days at sea . No sooner was the master beyond hearing than one of the sailors96asked me directions to the nearest wineshop and my reply that I , too , was a stranger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ship without revealing my insularism which , I am sure , was not apparent . They were from Palos as was their caravel ; and her name was Nina . ( Perhaps I should not put that so bluntly and here , in deference to your sensibilities , should attempt literary finesse , for I am quite aware that introduction of the noble Nina at this junction is , surely , something of a nonexpectation . But I must beseech your indulgence again inasmuch as I am a man for the point and , incapable of belletristicniceties , must , therefore , record this as it occurred even at the sufferance of ungracious obtundity . Also , I am quite aware that the Nina was , excepting the Ark of Noah , the most important vessel ever floated and this assertion you may challenge with mention of the craft that brought St. Paul to Rome , although no man knows her name , but I will not be moved . Perchance this seemingly is bias out of my own experience and if this be your assumption I will dispel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Great Voyage , but the Nina made three voyages to the New World and sailed more than 25,000 miles under command of Christopher Columbus ; so match that , if you can , and a blast to the wind for your challenge . ) And now because the Nina was the princess of The Discovery  --  the floundering Santa Maria was the queen and our Pinta was the courier  --  and now because of this I will tarry long enough to describe her , my recital being voice to my own observations as well as details furnished by the two sailors who are on history 's roster as Gutierre Perez and Juan Ortiz . The name Nina has been translated recklessly into " The Little Girl " and this is acceptable inasmuch as her sailors , in the sentimental fashion of our breed , did call her The Little Girl or The Little One . Actually , however , she was named for her owner , Juan Nino of N4oguer , this Moguer , as you know , being a small river port a few miles upstream from Palos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fence , in the way of Spaniards , it was necessary to feminize Nino into Nina . Her patron was Santa Clara and thus to be consistent , and IIeaven forbid such prosaic procedure , she should be called Santa Clara if the Galician is to be called Santa Maria . She was of 57 tons , and that is to say her capacity was 57 toneladas , or tuns , of wine , and wine being a common cargo and always the best ballast . Her keel was 50 feet and her over-all length was 70 , which , 97comparatively , was muchly smaller than St. Paul 's missionary ship of at least fifteen hundred years ago . And whereas this report may startle you , I suggest that you be troubled not one scintilla , for we have learned in this age of advancement that a ship 's worth is not in her size , but rather in her construction and in the salt of the men who sail her . The Nina was a typical Andalusian caravel in all ways save one : her soul was greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , althoughshe was not as fleet . I remained in conversation with the two sailors until the day was waning and then dreading the interrogation to which my Aunt Ronda was certain to expose me , I hastened to the monastery of Santa Maria de los Remedios and there to audience with a Franciscan , with whom I arranged to begin my lectures the next day , but only in map making . And , of course , my aunt began her examination of my day 's activitieseven before I had digested my sup and I told her I had enrolled for several courses , notably Latin , and this prevarication I confessed covertly and renounced most readily in my prayers . My tenure with the Franciscans was an experience virtually of no profit and this diminution must be imputed to my own indolence and , in turn , my sloth directly was traceable to the perturbation that the sea 's propinquity engendered in my humors and the melancholy persuasion that Maraela had disappeared into the labyrinth of Spain 's derangement . My father wrote that he knew nothing whatsoever of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cordovaor Barcelona , and then came his message that he was convinced they had fled to Italy for reasons most expedient , and this his way of informing me that they had exiled themselves to escape the Inquisition . And thus my beauteous Maraela moved from substance into fancy , from image into shadow , while I dawdled at the monastery in Lepe and there learned only two things that have any remote consanguinity with this narration . Firstly , it soon was apparent to me why conversos favored Franciscansover Dominicans in matters of gratuity and this simply because the Gray Friars of the sea country were not as zealous in the Inquisitionas the Black Friars of the inland cities and , in fact , I quickly learned that maritime folk generally are more tolerant of human frailties than their landlocked kinsmen and accept strangers more readily ; that they are more lenient concerning differences of race and nationality , and even religion . My Aunt Ronda was one of the exceptions. 98Secondly , I came in contact , obliquely to be sure , with Bartholomew Columbus , the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus stitched so carefully into the pattern that has mystified the world ; and this pattern a part of the riddle perpetuatedby himself , his heirs , and deifiers for purposes of vanity , glory , and avarice . Bartholomew Columbus rode a mule into Lepe from across the adjacent Portuguese border but could not procede farther into Spain in the same manner without an official permit and , like his brother , this adventurer turned first to the Franciscans for aid . It was the late summer of 1485 when he , dusty and irritable , appeared in the yard of the monastery , leading his mule and denouncing the asininity of the frontier guards who had warned him that , Portuguesevisitor or not , he was forbidden to stride his beast until he had received proper authorization . Upon learning his identity , the friars welcomed him and immediatelyset in motion his plea for permission to ride his mule to Cordova , where his brother was waiting for audience with the Crowns , either Isabel or Ferdinand or both ; and they too occupied with affairs of state to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration . The arrival of Bartholomew Columbus excited the monastery into a frenzy of speculation and I shared this ferment and on the second day of his visit I saw a member of the Columbus menage for the first time . He was sunning himself in the yard and I presumed the prerogativeof bidding him good morning and he answered most affably and in the best of breeding . He was a man of about twenty-three and perhaps an inch taller than I , and I was a youth of exactly five feet and six inches in those days . He was of good countenance and every word he spake he weighed most carefully , thus giving an indication of caution and wariness . And yet he was voluble , almost glib , a thorough master of positive colloquy without really ever saying anything . Extraordinarily fluent he was and extraordinarily nimble , quite like the hawkers who paraded in front of my father 's shop and called their wares in boastful assonance which , if clefted , had utterly no substance . Now this Bartholomew Columbus was ignorant of Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordova or even Seville and was a complete stranger to our customs , the delicate nuances of our ways . However , he spake our tongue in casual assurance , although frequently he called upon phrases of my grandmother 's generation , a99Spain I was too young to remember and so was he . I noticed particularlyhow asturely he heeded my modern expressions and how adroitly he imitated them . I was taken most favorably with Bartholomew Columbus and , therefore , you can appreciate my delight when the friars announced that he would lecture our school and stated his qualifications : that he and his brother had participated in a map-making enterprise in Lisbon , that Christopher Columbus , muchly traveled , had contributed the data and Bartholomew Columbus the draftsmanship , and together they had sold charts , maps , and other notabilia of use to mariners . This I believed and this I still believe because Bartholomew was a master at drafting , an art he demonstrated to exquisite perfection in his lecture to us , and spicing his discourse with anecdotes about the lands whose coastlines he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canary Isles , and the Azores . Now mark you this : he did not sketch , neither did he mention , the coast of Liguria , particularly of Genoa or any of Italy , and this a most singular omission inasmuch as Genoa reputedly was the native city of the Columbus household . Would not a man demonstrating map sketching almost instinctively use his native land as a model ? But , as God is my witness , he did not and at the time it seemed peculiar to me and then , in the doldrums of youth , I forgot about it . however , I did not forget the admonition with which he ended his lecture , for its presumptive impudence rankled my Andalusian pride . " I am in an enviable position , " he said , " to bring to you and to your countrymen intelligence most pertinent to Spanish requirements . Even now a valiant Portuguese mariner , by name Bartholomew Diaz , is readying an expedition to seek the Indies by sailing south around Africa . He has requested , and surely will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking . Portugal , as you know , is most generous to her pilots who will dare unknown waters for the glory of her sovereign . She is concerned more with advancement of the Faith , of science , and of frontiers than with wars and Inquisition . " He let the taunt rest upon our cognition and then said : " I count myself among those who believe the shortest route to India is westward . Portugal has rejected a westward expedition to accept Diaz ' southward venture . This is Spain 's opportunity . The negligence will be shameful and costly if this , the most enlightened state of all Europe , fails to explore westward to challenge Portugal 's southward expansion . " It was more than an inculpation . It was a threat , and yet how cunninglyframed and hung for all of us to see and talk about later androopass along to our families and friends . For , mind you , the only westwardexpedition even in the egg was the unhatched scheme of ChristopherColumbus to reach the Indies by crossing the Ocean Sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored householdin the world . The mule permit for Bartholomew Columbus to continue to Cordovawas approved a few days later and he departed Lepe , the monasteryreceded into the humdrums , and I into the phlegmatism of my indolence . Aunt Ronda scolded me often for my sloth and threatened to write my father and this stirred the pith of my resentment . I was weary of Lepe , was weary of everything , and only my filial loyaltyshackled me to that place and held me from the sea , from a course between the Pillars of Hercules and into the Mediterranean , and to Italy where I might find Maraela . I spent more hours on the water front than ever , just watching the ships and allowing my fancy the nebulous flights that are the heritage of youth ; the clouds into castles , the bay into the Ocean Sea , and I into Don Rodrigo of Triana , my feet firm on my quarter-deck and my eyes on the horizon , and Maraela on her couch , awaiting the return of her Jason . I was ripe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineshops and I so proud that the sailors sought my company and laughed at my wit and boasted to their women that I was their comrade and a gentleman of scholarship and purse  --  the few jingling maravedi that my father sent me each month . A cup of bitter wine was cheap , but the dregs were costly , and the first one called herself Maria . The wine and the woman convulsed me into frenzied lunacy and in my loathsome appetency I pretended her into Maraela ; a moment of bliss and then the consuming remorse . I slank like a panting dog back to Aunt Ronda 's house and quickly to bed before she saw me , my soul pleading God for succor and my heart pleading Maraela for forgiveness . The moon was full and I remember the superstition that the man in the moon was the sinner who had gathered sticks on the Sabbath to warm the harlot of his initiation . I shuddered my desolation and prayed myself to sleep . The next night she was at the same place , and I , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciscansthat I was attending lectures at widening intervals and , womanlike , she spliced effect to cause and then unraveled the rope and moaned her lamentations over each strand until she realized that commiserationis a worthless catharsis against the fever of Aspasia. rorSo she swelled into righteous anger and I often have wondered since if her wrath sprang from saintly indignation or virginal curiosity . " Ungrateful libertine ! " she railed at me . " Your indulgent father distraught in genteel poverty and you wasting his money in riotous profligacy -- - " My startled reaction checked her arraignment and I immediately was aware that she had revealed a confidence between her and my father : that I was in Lepe at financial privation to him , and this , I vow , was my first inkling of my father 's penury . It came as a bitter torment that I had wasted his substance and was unworthy of his trust and forthwith , despite Aunt Ronda 's profuse tears and copious wails , I wrote him that I no longer could accept his benevolence , that I was going to Palos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I had been offered a tutorship in the home of Pedro de Arcos and could be reached at the wineshop of Francisco Gallego , where lived my friend , Gomez Rascon , the one called The Rabbit . My aunt took to her bed in feigned illness to deter me and I kissed her cheek and left her there and , buckling on my poniard , walked resolutely out of her house , and glanced back only once to see her at her window , watching me and wiping her eyes on her sleeve . There was no ship to Palos that day and , besides , I had no money and so I assigned myself to a pottery hawker who was journeying to Huelva and had need of my strong back to help with his wares . We set forth from Lepe about midday and took the sandy road to the Odiel , the monger leading one laden mule and I the second . We reached Huelva the next afternoon and he gave me a few blancas for my hire and fed me in a public house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied each with the other in boasts and gossip . Here I heard that Bartholomew Columbus had arrived in Cordova and that Christopher Columbus had not seen Isabel or Ferdinand becausethe court had moved to Madrid for the winter ; and this opportunityI take to explain that the Spanish court was transilient , moving often from one noble 's estates to another and remaining with each host only long enough to exhaust his larder and hospitality . I asked the forum if any of the gentlemen present knew the whereaboutsof one Luis Harana , merchant , and they all shook their heads and assured me that if he were on the coast between Portugal and Gibraltar they would know it , and that none had ever heard his name . I arranged with the proprietor for a bed in exchange for services in the kitchen and then struck a bargain with a boatsman , my few blan-rozcas if he would row me down the lagoon that tied Rio Odiel to Rio Tinto , then across the Tinto to Palos de la Frontera . We set out soon after dawn and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily navigable until we came to the Tinto and there the harsh channel caught us and swept us below Palos , and I was put ashore directly across from Point del Sebo with instructions to walk the three miles to the city . Hunger was my first concern as I trudged up from the riverbank to the road to Palos and there , lofty on a bluff , was a monastery and there , as a wayfarer in need , I pounded the gate and was admitted to the friaryof La Rabida , where Christopher Columbus first had supped on Spanish hospitality and first had received Spanish encouragement for his venture . This , however , was naught to me and I even forgot that his son , Diego , was in the friars ' custody . I wanted only bread and directions and both were given gladly , the bread sopped in grease and a portion of cold mutton to stretch the skin of my belly into ample thews . " The establishment of Francisco Gallego ? " the friar looked closely at me . " Does one so young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend there and one I need see . " The wine he had given me was water-weakened and glowed my guts a bit , but had no sting . " Then that is different , little brother , for a friend is a jewel in heaven 's firmament or in a pigsty . " He walked with me to the gate and pointed up the road to Palos . " A mile , and no more , is the house of Martin Alonso Pinzon , mari-ner --  " Pinzon ! The pilot on the barge at Seville and my father 's friend  --  but , no , I must not lean on my father 's name or impose on his friends . The world was mine to have with my own hands and my own worth . " You veer from the road at Master Pinzon 's residence "  --  the Franciscanshielded his eyes and swept his left arm outward  --  " and take a footpath riverward . It will lead you to the alley on which is located Gallego 's shop . And , now , God attend thee , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bluff and I stood and surveyed the Niebla that had been the spine of Andalusia 's African trade untilour Crowns restricted commerce and left these ports to rot in their own stagnation ; Palos , Huelva , Moguer . There below me , at Point del Sebo , the Odiel and the Tinto swept into confluence to form Rio Saltes and the roadstead of Palos , and there the Ocean Sea rolling grayish-green into timelessness . The roadstead was empty and the Niebla was a sorry contrast to103Lepe , which was near enough to Portugal to enjoy some of the bustle and expansion of that happy kingdom . I hitched my belt an inch higher and raked my stocking-cap to the side of my head and trod up the road , and Alonso Pinzon 's house evoked my envy as its dimensions and elegance testified to the master 's affluence even in these trying times . Negro slaves were tending his personal vineyard and these blackbirds were among the few I had ever seen because the Guinea " mines " had been closed to Spain for almost five years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I veered riverward and there was Palos , cradled at the end of her harbor , and then I covered my eyes against the sun and peered at the only ship that gave any indication of activity . Santa Maria ! Marigalante ! Old Frivolous Mary . There she was again , easy at anchor and sailors on her crossarms , and it was like unto seeing an old friend from a far place and she reflected my mind to Seville , to Fray Juan and Mudarra and my father . I must write him this night that I am well . The path grew into a cobblestone alley and this I followed into Palos , and noticing the idle seamen in little groups on the corners and Guinea barracoons built close to the harbor and stenching the air most foully . It was my intent to inquire the exact location of Gallego 's shop and I stopped at an apothecary 's for this chore and my hand was on the door to enter when I saw the shelf of aloes in the window and in the center , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tentacles withered and dried like those of a dead octupus . A passing sailor saw me transfixed and touched my arm and motionedhis head toward the Medusa . " Worth more than a Guinea blackbird , that one is . " " Aye , " I replied . " Whence came it ? " Could it have come from Luis I-Iarana ? Was this horrible aloe to lead me to her ? " How should I know ? " the sailor grimaced at me . " Am I one to break the Queen 's law and trade with Africa ? " Then he shrugged and smiled . " Perhaps it came from the Azores or the Canaries . They can be had , you know , if a man dares venture his neck into the Queen 's wrath . " " I have a long neck . " I met his stare and sought to read it . " And an expensive poniard , I see . " " A sharp poniard . And the friendship of Pedro de Arcos and Gomez Rascon. " 104 " Ah-h-h . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no land , and a Sevillano is neither stranger in heaven , nor in hell . And now where is the establishment of Francisco Gallego ? " The wineshop was but a stone 's throw down the alley and , reaching it , I opened the door to inquire of Rascon , and my heart leaped as his squeaky voice sounded from a rear table of the public house . " A pox on you , Francisco Gallego , and a He for your dreggy wine . " Then he saw me and sprang to his feet and spilled his wine in his haste to greet me . " Lepe ! By the neglected cods of Paul and Silas . Lepe ! " C H A P T E R 10NEVER REACHED THE HOME OF PEDRO DE ARCOS ; I WAS NEVER Atutor . Alas ! From this day until I was hounded into the role of Mudarra the bastard Moor , and that after The Discovery , I relegated all scholarship to the recess of my volition and rent the veil between me and the world of callous wit and sinewy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Weeping Philosopher . The Rabbit demanded a jeroboam of publican Gallego 's best wine and we drank first to our reunion and then to Arcos and to the Queen , to my father and old Mudarra and Fray Juan , to Maria back in Lepe and my aunt and a host of persons , only I did not mention Maraela , and I was soaked in loquacious bacchanalia when I remembered the Medusa of Mauretania and presumed to ask why such an exotic rarity was on display in this moribund port . " If it crosses the sea , it will reach Palos . " The Rabbit was eying me warily , his lips puckering rapidly like his cognominal mammal approaching a delectable morsel . " By the Thirty Pieces , Rabbit ! " I banged my tankard on the table in hardy enthusiasm . " I would give my left arm up to here for one of those aloes . " I touched my elbow . " Aye , up to here . " I touched my shoulder. 105He shook his head to clear it and pushed his goblet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blackbirds are betterarticles of vendue , but if you have need for contraband aloes they can be had in the Guinea Isles , provided you are willing to risk a hundred lashes on your back and ten years in a dungeon . " Then he sought to shift the conversation and this I would not allow , but kept prying until , in exasperation , he glared at me as though I were a babe with a wet bottom . " B'rlady , Lepe ! The sea is Palos ' basket and the staunch paladins of the Niebla will never allow a dry-foot 's law to starve us , even though the injunction be regal . " I weighed the import of his declaration and jibbed my course a bit . " Where sails the Santa Maria ? " " Frivolous Mary , " he corrected me and reached across the table and shoved my tankard aside . " I am not the harbor master of Palos ; only a gromet who can never be a mariner because of my affliction . To the point , Lepe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed ? " I stuck to the name because she was a friend from Seville and worthy of dignity . " I will not . " He glanced over his shoulder and waved Gallego back to the kitchen . My resolution , spontaneous in its origin and obstinate in its purpose , borned the words that changed my life : " Is there a berth for another gromet on her ? " For almost a minute he did not speak , only looking at me . " You are a student , Lepe . " " I want aloes , Rabbit . " " The first lash draws blood , my friend . The last one you do not feel . You are unconscious . " " There are no welts on your back . " " You go mad the first year in the Oueen 's dungeon and after the fifth they forget you are there , forget even to bury you . " " When does she sail ? " I demanded . " And will she berth me ? " " Iron in your craw , spurred cockerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tankards . " Salt in your guts , by Iscariot 's issue ! Gallego ! Come in reverence , you puffed pinchfist . " The publican approached in unctuous servility and The Rabbit condescendedto pour him a cup of our drink and then commanded : " Send to the residence of Pedro de Arcos and request him to attend me here . I have a happy lick for his humors . " Gallego bowed his exit and Rascon fixed his gaze on me . " On thero6morrow 's tide the second ship of an unheralded expedition will arrive . The caravel Pinta from Cadiz . Home port is Palos . Her patron is Santa Catalina . " ( Ah , valiant Pinta . Here I heard your name for the first time and from your servant , gnomed Gomez Rascon , who loved thee as much as I. Had I but known the years , I would have lifted my tankard to every timber in thy keel , to every block and studding . Noble Mercury , my Pinta ! ) " Then two ships for the voyage ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The Rabbit nodded . " You and I and Arcos for Frivolous Mary . We sail first for Coruna in Galicia , and take a legal cargo . " " Then where ? " " We will be at the tip of Spain and if the winds of the Ocean Sea are spiteful and we lose our course --  " He shrugged his indifference . " Who is to judge where we anchor for food and water save God , and never the Queen . You have money ? " " Not a blanca . " " Confusion seize , pothunter ! " His scowl testified that my poverty was most disconcerting . " You can not buy aloes on your miserable pay . You will need money . " He glanced at my poniard and his eyes lighted his mentation . And this I read and so declared firmly , " No . " " You will not need it on the voyage . I have my blade and I will be at your side . " " No , " I said , but less firmly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return you can redeem it . If you do not return , you will not need it . " He grinned the diabolic logic of his contention . " But , now , hear me . Your risk is your own . " I was most vexed that he should continue to treat me as a child and spake out in annoyance . " I am aware of the penalties for smug-gling --  " " It is not smuggling ! " The Rabbit slapped his hand on the table . " It is trafficking , and a useful enterprise although slightly illegal . " I smiled my amusement at his distinction between smuggling and trafficking , between black and gray , albeit there was a variance and upon this I will elucidate now in deference to your time and patience . All intercourse between Spain and Africa being forbidden , there developed divers systems of profit taking and these included smuggling , 107which was an inefficient trade conducted by fishermen , gypsies , and other hazarders , and then the vast enterprise known as trafficking , and this an organized participation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thusly : a master leased a vessel by verbal agreement and often the owner then signed on as pilot or even as a seaman . A legal cargo was taken aboard and the ship lawfully cleared for an open port and , thence , by devious methods made for a second port and there traded in contraband . The goods were unloaded in Palos and picked up by merchants who pretended no knowledge of the voyage , for , mind you , the merchandise itself was not contraband . For example , slavery was not forbidden , it was only forbidden to import slaves . The merchants shared a pittance of their gain with various officials and the Niebla continued in trade . From Cadiz to the Portuguese border , Andalusian seamen , masters , brokers , merchants , and functionaries were interlocked in trafficking , although the victims of the risks were the mariners who went after the cargoes and ran them up the Tinto , often under the blind eyes of thieving satraps . Sometimes , to restrain or discourage investigations by the Crowns , the functionaries seized a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leathered the crew , and reported to the court that the Niebla was prosperous and submissive , and this by the grace of Queen Isabel and to the glory of King Ferdinand . Then the ship reverted to its owner who , nursing his welts , leased it to another master and the rigol of being prosperous and submissive whirled its merry course . Rascon explained all this to me in drunken garrulity and brave gestures and was mimicking a lash-master when Arcos arrived and greeted me in a manner most fatherly and scowled at The Rabbit . " What now , imp ? Has Gallego hobbled your roger as security for your debts ? " The little devil pushed the jeroboam and a mug before Arcos . " T'he cockerel goes crowing with us . " His lips puckered rapidly and he wagged his head in glee . " We will berth him as a gromet on Frivo-'ous Mary . " " What 's this ? " The ruddy stalwart shouted the inquiry and clamped his hand on The Rabbit 's humped shoulder . " Lepe is a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see an innocent spread-eagled on the ladder of La Cosa 's stinking jade ? " Rascon shrugged off the hand and nodded for me to defend hisio8words and this I did . " I am no longer a student , Arcos . I am going trading . " " Trading , eh ? " His blood reddened his countenance into flushed agitation . " Have you ever smelled bilge under your bed and picked lice from every hair on your body ? " " No , sir . " " Have you ever drunk slime in your water and eaten worms in your bread ? " " No , sir . " " And your bowels running blood while your guts choke your throat ? " " No , sir . " I lifted my tankard to him and grinned . " But I am going to sea , Arcos . With you and The Rabbit , I hope , but if that is not your will then I seek a berth for myself . I ask only that you not dismay my father --  " " But you will write him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , " I promised . " After I have taken the master 's knife in bounded fealty to his command . " Rascon banged the table with his fist and laughed his delight in that effeminate tone of his , the grating contradiction of a squeaking voice from the callous throat of a cynical marplot . " Clear your scuppers , old one . We have a shipmate . " . " Mother of men ! " Arcos reached for his wine and quaffed its goodly mockery until a trickle ran from the corners of his lips . " Will glory of Andalusia ever die ? " He filled his tankard again and lifted it to me . " If your father were here and younger , he would be with us . Now , to the voyage , Rodrigo of Triana , Lepe of our brotherhood . Your saint ? " " Christopher . " " Ah-h-h . The Christ-bearer . May he attend you . " We drank , and Gallego came and drank with us and it was Arcos who bought me my first sailor 's smock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hood to be pulled over my head in foul weather . The Rabbit gave me my first gorro , the red stocking-cap of his trade , and that was the garb of Andalusian sailors who opened the world to all men : a rough smock and a red cap . Feet bare , of course . I kicked off my shoes and put the smock over my jacket and breeches , raked my gorro to the side of my head and raised high my tankard . " Dum vivimus , vivamus . " I toasted for all to hear and in my undutiful vainglory I wished most of all for Maraela to hear and admire my resolution , and chastise her own conduct for deserting such a worthy man. 109Gallego fetched meat and bread and we reveled until Arcos ' eyes reddened with his wine and his drooping lids and jowls sagged his face into a mummer 's mask . He mumbled a parting and stumbled into the night and I , lively as a sprite and drunk as a Don , bargained with Gallego for my poniard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demanded 7000 . We settled for 65oo minus my sup and drink ; a small sum indeed for the memory of Maraela that I could feel at my side and touch with my fingers . The Rabbit witnessed the transaction and tossed the empty jeroboamto the publican . " A jericho for your wife , foul usurer , if her aim is true . And now a couch for my brother . " Gallego led him to his bed and then showed me to a couch at the end of a dingy hall and I sprawled on the straw , knowing not the hour . My mouth tasted of dregs and devils the next morning , but Rascon pulled me from my bearing and coaxed me to soup and a tumbler of watered wine , and then to the harbor where Arcos awaited us , and aboard the Santa Maria and to the presence of her master . His name I will not disclose as his progeny now are gentlemen of eminent respectability , but this I will vow : he was not Martin Alonso Pinzon , whose wealth his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on trafficking . I know not and care not if Pinzon ever delivered contraband for vendue , but I swear to you by the five wounds of your sacred Lamb that I never saw him on the deck of a trafficker , and I sailed from the Niebla for almost seven years , from the winter of 1485 to the summer of 1492 , the year of The Discovery . The master , who also was captain on my first voyage , heeded the advocacy of Pedro de Arcos , the best helmsman in all Spain , and the impertinent demands of Gomez Rascon , the knave and jester , and signed me to his company as a gromet , a ship 's boy to tend the forecastle , where much gear was stowed , and to make myself useful at commands of the master , the pilots , the boatswain , and the carpenter , who also served as surgeon . I was to receive 3500 maravedis a month of twenty-two days , payable upon our return , and was allowed one seaman 's chest of light wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet in width or depth . In lieu of this chest , I could have space in the hold for one blackbird , his keep to be deducted from my pay . My own keep was furnished and , in fair weather , I could cook one warm meal a day on the firebox , just aft of the forecastle , and simply a tub of sand shielded against the wind and called " the pot . " 110I must lead my watch , if it be twilight , in the Salve Regina and turn the glasses on the half hours . To all these I agreed and the master gave me my knife , a small Damascus blade with which I must cut my food and tend rope . It had a wooden hilt , but no bar to protect my hand and a slip meant bloody fingers or a bloody palm . The deed was done and The Rabbit showed me about the Santa Maria , the 93 feet from her bow to stern , first the forecastle deck shadowed by the foremast , then down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the smoking pot and the forward windlasses to the great hatch into the hold , and this ballasted with rocks which served also as shots for the bombard , although there were leaden balls for the falconet , the only other piece aboard . Then up to the half deck and the mainmast , and up still higher to the stern , and there the quarter-deck and the mizzen . Just under the quarter-deck was the captain 's cabin , its door onto the half deck and windows in the stern and there a poop for the mighty . Like all fitting craft of her day , the Santa Maria carried seven anchors , the sheet hook in the hold to be dragged out and dropped only in emergencies , and two always on the bows and two in reserve . Then there was a stern anchor to keep her nose in the swells and a kedge for forward headway in shoals . Her yawl was lashed on the main deck in rough weather , but floated astern in easy seas . Next Rascon and I , and me bubbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiller and this deep in the stern and just aft of the pilots ' quarters , and there was Arcos at his compass and himself propped against the stout beam of his tiller , and this to the rudderpost and there a gaping port that could not be closed inasmuch as the tiller had need of ample play to control the rudder . Arcos beamed the lordliness of his trade as he showed me the tiller and let me feel it and pointed up to a small opening in the quarter-deck and through this I saw a speck of sky and a bit of sail , and nothing more . And now in this way was the ship handled : the captain the lord of all and the master setting the course and the sails , and instructions to the pilot who kept his watch on the quarter-deck and close by his compass and calling the course down to the helmsman and he constantlychecking his own compass against the pilot 's and then steering by the feel of the ship and the lodestone in his own spine . We went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it111mumbled loudly enough for me to hear , " But then I do not examine the stems of my sailors . " Arcos joined The Rabbit and me for a meal of sardines and olives and then went to his home to bid his family farewell and Rascon went bargaining for a gorro with a tassel , and I wrote my father that I was going voyaging on the Santa Maria and for him to pray for me ; and my esteem to old Mudarra . We went aboard at dusk and The Rabbit showed me how to turn the glass and taught me the time song : " Good is that which passeth , Better is that which cometh ; An hour is past and another floweth , More shall flow if God willeth ; Count and pass makes voyage fast . " I sang it out and the seamen already on watch nodded their appreciationas my voice was hearty and resonant . All time was measured by watches and glasses , and hours had no meaning , and this was the first evening watch , called the second dogwatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the binnacle that housed the pilot 's compass , and trimmed the lantern there , then held it aloft and chanted : " Amen and God give us a good night , sir captain and master and brotherly company . " His thin tone was praiseful , and this very meet and proper , and all the ship 's company gathered and we sang our Salve Regina and the hymn floated across the harbor to Palos and beyond . The Pinta was singing , also . The officers had bunks in their quarters and seamen and gromets bedded down where we could , usually on deck , and Rascon quickly taught me the trick of bedding on the great hatch , which was level and in comfortable contrast to the arched deck . He soon was breathing deeply the innocence of sleep , but I lay awake until the dogwatch gromet sang the time song , the glass turningand me watching the stars and wishing for straw for my back . We were away on the flood tide , Palos still sleeping and the night growing old , and all hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria creaked out of the harbor and into the Rio Tinto , then turned her bow toward the Gulf of Cadiz and the Ocean Sea . A lanterndangled on the bowsprit and the Pinta was in our wake , her runninglight dipping as she flexed her back and belly for the run through the gulf for Cape St. Vincent. was winter , and The Rabbit tasted the breeze and pointed riverward to the caravel crawling into the harbor . " The Pinta , " he said as though it were nothing , and that is all it was to me that day ; nothing . She was small , much smaller than the Santa Maria and smaller even than the Nina I had seen in Lepe , but square-rigged and lively . She was called " The Painted One " in the fashion of amorous sailors , but her planking was mottled and sea-eaten . Actually her name came from her first owners , the Pinto family of Palos . Her present owner was Christopher Quintero , also of Palos , and her sobriquet of " The Painted One " merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted lips and tinted cheeks . It was after noon , and the Pinta still inching in , when Rascon and I went ashore and there on a wharf and before a chandlery that bore his name was Martin Alonso Pinzon peering at me , and I alert to his attendance and with proper presentation of my identity , and this in utmost deference because my gorro was the signum of the cleft be- tween Lepe the sailor and Pinzon the master . " Rodrigo the son of Vicente Bermejo , eh ? " His black , black hair was greasy in the December sun and his swarthy countenance bristled his morning 's awn . " And I hear you are for the Galician with Arcos and that rogue at your side . " He jerked his head toward The Rabbit . My comrade twitched his face into an appearance most comical and bespoke Pinzon as though there was no station between Gomez Rascon and the richest man in Palos . " Belay the backstays , sire . Am I not the superior gromet of all Spain ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your whore bed , knave , while I talk to this man . " The Rabbit dangled his withered arm like a ratline in a breeze and budged not one foot and Pinzon laughed and then addressed me . " Your father knows of this venture ? " " I-ie will , sire . I am writing him this day . " " Discretion is the handmaiden of valor , Rodrigo . " " That I realize , and caution is my watchword . And now , sire , when go you to Seville ? " " Within a few months . I sail this week for Rome . On a caravel I have leased . The Nina of this port . " " Perchance some day I can sail with you . " He tugged his hair that hung straight and short to his ears and straight across his forehead . " I do not ship men who are branded on their rumps . If I know it . " He turned from me and into his shop , but 112113The Gulf of Cadiz is green and gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all man 's endeavor is more monotonous than a voyage in good weather , the tedium never varying under the stringent discipline of everything done the same time in the same manner by the same hands . Even I , my feet scarcely damp , quickly was aware that the Santa Maria was a clumsy sailer ( and remember she was a Galician and not an Andalusian ) verily a flying pig , for the Niebla yet was off our starboardbeam before the little Pinta , scudding without spritsail at her bow or bonnets on her main course , keeled by us and shook her stern in our noses and was gone . And now , kind friends ( and if you have come this far with me , I may call you friends ) I will not here narrate the details of my first voyage or any subsequent voyages until The Discovery , and this in deference to your patience . One voyage is quite like another , all circumstances being similar , and I assume you are interested only in the voyage . Therefore , I will not serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then tell you how we sailed across the Ocean Sea with Christopher Columbus , whose name means Christ-bearer Dove , to the New World that he believed was India . It is sufficient that by the time we raised Cape Finisterre at the westernmost tip of Spain I had mastered all my duties as gromet and was with the ropes and sheets and in my apprentice as seaman . I learned readily , being an apt pupil and most strong for my years and of sharp faculties . The Pinta , in ballast and rummaged , which is to say cleansed and sweetened after the voyage , was waiting for us at Coruna and we unloadedour cargo of wine tuns and a few dyed silks from Persia , smuggledin from Malta , and The Rabbit drew against his pay for an orgy in port and insisted that I accompany him . This I refused to do , electing to remain on shipboard with Arcos and thus conserve my resources . We remained in port a week before we were bound away and bow on into the Ocean Sea and hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must report if questioned back in Palos . The winter gales , down from Flanders and England , struck us on the second day out and we close-hauled and ran with the wind , down into the Sea of the Mares , thusly called because so many horses died in shipment across those waters ; hard down for the Canaries , and to anchor at Las Palmas. rr4The year had turned to ' 86 and the winter was breaking up and the Guinea Isles seethed with enterprises , mostly illegal ; blackbirds and aloes from Africa , damask from Damascus , poplin from Avignon , gauze from Gaza , and iron from England , the home of those who put as much faith in metals as Spaniards did in honor . Our master , with a purse of ducats at his belt , made arrangements with the proper authorities and then we were permitted ashore to trade and Arcos and The Rabbit bought two Negroes at auction while I went bargaining for aloes . There were no Medusas in Las Palmas , a Portuguese bastard having traded for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable spider aloes and in these I invested all of my resources and put them in my sea chest and it filled with sand and soil . The Pinta still was trading , and a few of our company also , when a Castillian sail was reported offshore , luffing against a wind that was leeward to us , and this good fortune we used to scud out of the harbor that night and , all lights doused and the pot covered , back to our course and the six hundred mile haul to Palos. /I could work any line , bow , bunt , or clew by the day we sighted the Point of Umbria in beautiful Andalusia , then across the bar and into Rio Saltes , to Rio Tinto and home . I was a sailor . My belly was hard and flat and the muscles knotted at my shoulders and flowed strong into my sinews . The calluses on my feet and hands were thick and rough and my hair crinkled and lay long to my neck . My eyes were blue clear and my beard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a man . So bold and greedy were the merchants of Palos that they did not wait for auction , but came aboard the Santa Maria and bargained openly for our contraband , and Arcos did well with his blackbird and The Rabbit even better by swearing that his man was an Ethiopian of the ancient land of Sheba 's crown and a true descendant of Soloman 's seed . He swore by the regeneration of Dismas . I sold half of my aloes for a goodly profit and the remainder I kept to send to my father . Arcos helped me carry my sea chest to Gallego 's place and there I redeemed my poniard and ordered wine for all present , then retired to a corner to read the letters my father had dispatched to this address . I opened them in the sequence that Gallego had received them , the115first written the preceding December . My father was well , and also old Mudarra and Fray Juan , and there was no censure that I had gone to sea , only hope and prayers for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new army to be fielded against Granada 's Moors in a war that had become a ladder of sieges with King Boabdil falling back steadily but taking heinous toll while Ferdinand waded in the blood of his own warriors and strove mightily to conjure up the ardor of the old Crusades . His shrewd spouse , the pious Isabel , was in camp with him and knotting the frayed strands of statecraft into the stout rope that was to bind all Spain into one kingdom , and she using her intuitive wits more profitably than he used his mailed fist . Already she was counting the princes of Europe to arrange a fertile marriage for her imbecile daughter , the piteous Joanna , who was a child of staring eyes and stagnant intellect . Isabel 's scheme was apparent even to the beggars of Europe : strengthen her own house and the Spanish arm of the Holy Church , maneuver the Moors out of the realm , unite the country , marry her issues into strong families , and then create an empire beyond the sea , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exhausted , and the Spanish beehive was buzzing and soon the hungry bees must take flight or die , and the squirming gum needed only a queen , and this was Isabel , and the Queen needed only a captain . She held all the reins of the Inquisition and skillfully manipulated them , checking the horses of the Apocalypse when her nobles frowned and lashing the beasts to a froth when her nobles turned their heads , and feeding converso heretics to old Quemadero that the smoke might blind the people and hide the barren fields , the withered vineyards , and the blood torrents in Granada . The Queen needed time and a captain . And the people , the bees swarming for flight , had ceased murmuringagainst conversos and now were crying out against the public Jews , who were not heretics in any manner , but stalwarts in their faith ; the fathers snarling " Christ-killers " in the streets and the children shrieking , " Stone them out ! " For fourteen hundred years , Christians and Jews had lived under the same starry canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed the sweet air of this land , but now the canopy was rent and the thunder was crashing through. 116And Isabel was curling the whip over the backs of the frenzied horses of St. John 's revelation , wheeling them into Granada 's torment , lashing them through Quemadero 's smoke , trotting them on parade for the nobles , jerking their heads into reverent bows for the priests . All this my father wrote me , and sadly . But hold ! Benjamin Marino was back in Seville and with his family , his wife , a son , and a daughter , lecturing again at the college . His map was finished , and this instrument for the Franciscans , and this is all my father knew of the matter . Yet hear ! Christopher Columbus had seen the Queen and she most impressed , not by his knowledge but by his zeal , and now he was at the University of Salamanca to appear before a Commission of Learned Men and there espouse his cause under the aegis of Franciscan prestige and converso purse . Of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more , for the same letter that gave mention to Christopher Columbus brought the news that Luis Harana was dead . This unhappy intelligence , gleamed through the fingers of the Inquisition'slong arm , was a token of bereavement from Fray Juan to my father that the house of Bermejo might know the woeful loss and mourn our friend . Luis Harana , merchant , was dead of fever in the village of Porcuna near Cordova and there buried , and Maraela had gone to abide with kinsmen and of these neither my father nor Fray Juan had any knowledge ; name or abode . The letter lay loosely in my hand and the memories swirled through the pungent vapors of Gallego 's wineshop , the high revelry of sailors home , the drunken boasts of The Rabbit , the cacophonous clamor and the oaths by bell , book , and candle . I had not thought of Maraela in weeks . A man forgets the taste of sweet wine if the vineyards are barren. 117C H A P T E R I IDRANK THAT NIGHT TO THE DEMIGODS OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to The Cid , who sprang of this soil , and in my spirituous torpidity I wasted much of my substance from the voyage and insensibly pledged to help weigh the Santa Maria 's anchors within a week and his for the Flemish ports on a licit expedition . The Rabbit procured an array of women and Arcos sprawled at a table and bellowed , " Clear the scuppers , Lepe ! Clear the scuppers , Rabbit ! " It was dawn-coming when Gallego and two seamen dragged me to the harbor and doused me into presentable sobriety and I shaved off my beard and slept until midmorning and then to the chandlery to see Martin Alonso Pinzon , himself recently returned from his voyage to Rome . He was most censorious of my behavior the night before , having heard the harbor gossip , but agreed , nevertheless , to take my remainingaloes to my father on his next trip to Seville , and that before the new moon . I sensed that he was anxious to talk to me on some matter of his concern , or of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You were a student at the College of Seville , uh , Rodrigo ? " " That is correct , sire , " I said , volunteering nothing . " Map making , perhaps ? " " Among other things . " Pinzon beckoned a servant , who set before us two goblets of excellentRoman wine , and I toasted the master 's health , and this in utmost circumspection , for in the company of gentlemen I was their kind and at ease . He acknowledged my compliment , then looked at me searchingly and spake in a manner that suggested confidence withoutso saying : " The wisest geographer of the Niebla is Fray Antonio de Marchena of the monastery at La Rabida and he has gone inland to espouse the chimeric design of a certain Christopher Columbus to reach the Indies by sailing west . " 118 " I have heard of Christopher Columbus , and muchly , " I said and was somewhat vexed that he should think me ignorant of national affairs . " All Spain has . " " Spain will hear more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I spoke my judgment as though it were a learned pronunciamento . " He prattles like a mystic and wears the robes of prophecy . " Pinzon relaxed in his chair and folded his hands behind his head . " Visionary , uh ? Christopher Columbus is a visionary , so they all say . And Alonso Pinzon is a realist , a practical mariner , master and merchant . Hear me , young worthy . The difference between a realist and a visionary is this : the realist will settle for half a cask of wine ; the visionary demands all or nothing . " He turned and gazed toward the harbor , the Santa Maria and the Pinta at anchor and the Nina and other craft in dock . " I have a friend  --  " He moved his gaze from the harbor and to me . " I have been to Rome . " " Yes , Captain Pinzon . All Palos knows you have been to Rome . Did you see the Holy Father ? " " I delayed you here for a purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " All Rome is in a ferment of excitation and has fallen prey to Europe 's latest plague  --  the fever of exploration . Even His Holiness himself has a rash of the epidemic . " He peered into his wine goblet , then drained it . " Now , in the household of the Pope I have a friend who believes India is westward , for sure , but too far removed for a voyage in that direction . " All of this I had heard before from Fray Juan and from BenjaminMarino , and now the concept had seeped from the Holy House itself to Martin Alonso Pinzon , who was a sailor and not a geographer , a practical trader and not a dreamer . I smiled to myself , remembering the long hours in the College of Seville , the ardor of Marino , the zeal of Fray Juan , and the verbosity of the prior . " The source of my agitation , this friend in Rome --  " Pinzon clicked his fingernails and did not look up at me . " He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes there is land within 700 leagues of Spain and directly across the Ocean Sea , but unknown land and not India at all . " " The Marino theorem , " I said casually . His head came up with a jerk and his black eyes sparkled his sudden Anticipation . " That is the name I wanted to hear . Benjamin Marino , the Jew . He lectured at your college ? ' ' 119 " Aye . " " Do you know him ? " Now it must be remembered that I was the son of a merchant and , extravagant as I was , I was ever one for a bargain . It was quite obvious that I possessed knowledge that Pinzon had need of , and , therefore , a barter was in order . I , too , peered into my goblet and was silent just long enough to indicate my willingness to trade , and then I said , " He was my teacher . " " Did he lecture on the unknown lands ? " For a practical merchant , Pinzon was childishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 leagues west ? Did you see a map ? " I lifted my goblet again , turning it slowly in my hand , and quickly he motioned to his servant and the goblet was filled . " Benjamin Marinois the best map maker in Europe , " I said , and , as you perceive , I really said nothing that all Spain did not know . Nervously Pinzon nibbled at a bit of nail on his middle finger , and his eyes , sparkling the minute before , now were cloudy and cold . " Naturally , " he said in aloof disdain , " there will be no fee for delivery of your aloes to your father . " " That is most kind , " I replied . " And that wine --  " He nodded toward my goblet . " I brought two tuns from Rome and one of these for my good friend , Vicente Ber-mejo . " " The wine of our Pope 's household , and this surely . " I sniffed the bouquet , and my nose , trained to the bitter wines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested a proficiency in such matters . " Naturally , " Pinzon said . " Red gold in Seville . " " You are most gracious , sire . " I crossed my legs in the confidence of my status , and leaned back in my chair . " But you have digressed from our subject . We were discussing Benjamin Marino . He has prepared a map for the Franciscans , and naturally this you know . " " Naturally , " he said in the mendacious assurance of a trader . " The map possibly is in the possession of Christopher Columbus , whose cause the Franciscans espouse . " " Obviously , " he said as though I were speaking trifles and yet I knew he was engraving every word on his memory . " Have you seen this map ? " I shrugged my shoulders and lifted my hands in a gesture of disvaluation . " No , Captain Pinzon . Do you need a map for your quarter-12odeck ? I heard Benjamin Marino explain his theories . Therefore , I know his map . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I spoke out . " Teacher Marino 's map , and of this I am positive , fixes the degree at 62  --  miles and places terra incognita roughly 3000 miles west of Spain , and there legendary Antilia  --  the island opposite  --  and beyond Antilia a mass of unknown land . " I relaxed and enjoyed the simplicity and accuracy of my declaration . Alonso Pinzon glowered at me in search of a hint of trickery and , finding none , smiled his gratitude and struck his desk with his clinched fist . " It accords . By the portals of Purgatory , it fits ! The Holy City agrees with Marino . The Church with a Jew . " And then his vanity came forth , as it must in all men , and he could not deny himself the aggrandizement of these words : " My friend , and surely on advice of the Holy Father himself , has suggested that I equip two caravels and go exploring westward . " " Why not ? " I asked , instinctively calculating how I might profit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fateful pause in the lives of men ) and then shook his head in rumination . " I have not the wealth to sponsor such an expedition . " " Our Lady 's finger , sire ! Is it remiss for a lowly gromet to remind the captain that the Niebla will be patron for such a voyage . One nod from you and the Niebla and all her ships and men are at your command . " The temptation was in his eyes , the warm glow of a great thing almost done , and he shook it off , and it passed . " I am unknown at court , " he said . " I have not the sanction of the realm . " ( Oh no , Martin Alonso Pinzon . No , no , my captain . Your name is on no speck of land in the new islands , on no spot of water , only because there was no imagination in your humors . The Fates knocked and you scorned them . One word from Rome would have opened every royal door in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the realm 's sanction , and this knowledgetormented you until your death . It was not courage , for you could sail a ship into the red jaws of hell and out again on Satan 's saliva . No , Pinzon . You were first a trader  --  a blanca here to get two blancas there . The difference between you and Christopher Columbuswas the difference between vision and substance , for he believed a dream and you dreamed a belief . The Fates caress those who cast their dice upon the waves and stake their lives that fortune 's ivory will121float , that the gods themselves will swirl the spots into the miraculous combination that ordains the wreath of immortality upon the brow of the one who dreams and dares . Aye , Pinzon , you were the realist of substance , the cautious disciple of the Philistines who will not believe ere they can see ; you were the pragmatical stalwart  --  Christopher Columbuswas the fool . ) I stared at Pinzon in the galled realization that he was a timid man , that he was a lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never a chieftain , a knight but never a king . His eyes shifted to avoid my stare and he said , " I must think on these things . " ( Did Jason ruminate in Iolcus with the Golden Fleece in Colchis ? Did he reflect on the dragons ' teeth sown ? ) I departed that place and left the richest man in Palos to sip his sweet Roman wine and went straightwith to Gallego 's lair and there ordered a jeroboam of the Niebla 's strong , bitter vintage , which smelled of Spanish sun and tasted of Spanish earth ; and The Rabbit joined me and asked whereof my melancholia and I told him not , but sipped the drink into eventual song and gaiety . My funds were dissipated when we boarded the Santa Maria five days later and my sea whiskers were sprouting thick when we cleared the bar at the roadstead and our flying pig buried her nose in the gray , waste , and we were away for the Flemish ports . Our cargo was spun cotton and Andalusian pottery and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land was a sodden province of barbarianswho never had heard of Salamanca or even The Cid ; thence to Hull in England and that a region of perfidious tricksters and , by the bald head of Elijah and the hairy back of Esau , the most profane people in all the world . It was no wonder at all that The Maid of Arc had called them Goddammees and that in France an Englishman was Jean Goddamo . We were out of Hull by late summer , a hold of English wool and salt for Lisbon , and off Cap de la Hague when misfortune 's wile , shrouded by a Channel squall , brushed a sailor of the starboard watch and he fell from the crossarm of the main topsail and shattered his spine on the great hatch . Our surgeon lashed him to a plank and he departed us in blubbering agony and we committed him to the sea , a stone at his feet , and I was given his berth and became an able seaman , and this to the cheer of Arcos but to the stricture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falconet on the half deck and sang out : " I will nurse the embers of the pot and fetch drink to all gentlemen122and mariners , yet no commands will I hear from Lepe the sailor . " I leaped to the falconet , balanced myself as agilely as he and seized him and heaved him into the arms of Arcos , and all the company laughed , and The Rabbit the loudest of all , for we were a merry crew and all Andalusians ; beans in our bellies and warm bile for our humors and our Santa Maria grunting her way homeward . Summer into autumn and we were off Lusitania , off Cabo Raso , and there a Portuguese galley of four bombards spake us and ordered us to proceed cautiously up the Tagus to Lisbon as the roadstead was swarming ships to witness the leave of Bartholomew Diaz . Our master acknowledged the order and The Rabbit gave the galley his stern and a blast and shouted that we were Andalusians from Palos and a fie for a Portuguese parvenu with four bombards . The patrol did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master cuffed his flippant mouth and we crept to the maw of the Tagus with forecourseand mizzen and then the breeze failed us and we went into Lisbon on an ash wind , working our long sweeps through the ports while The Rabbit squatted and taunted us , he being spared such labor , owing to his withered arm . Even our haughty Andalusians were stilled into envious silence by the splendor of Portugal 's capital , for here indeed was the most active port of all Europe because this realm looked to the sea and not to the ashes of old Quemadero . Never before had I seen so many ships or a people so happy in the blessed activity of accomplishments . A harbor patrol , an innovation I had seen in no other port , boarded us and directed us to a slip and anchorage and sternly criticized the vermin and odors of our hold and ordered us to rummage ere we unloaded . Our master was indignant and the Portuguese shrugged their indifference to his spluttering wrath and there was no recourse save to do their bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hold with vinegar and water , and the rats scampered down the anchor ropes and swam ashore while the vermin curled and died and The Rabbit shrieked his bane on all things Portuguese and , in retaliation , foreswore the pleasures of Oporto wine and Lisbon women . " Let their loins wither for Andalusian solace . " He spat in the Tagus toward the city . " Out upon ! And the curse of the foam of Judas upon this realm . " The rummage delayed us for five days and for this I was grateful as we were still at anchor the morning Bartholomew Diaz ' three caravels dropped down the Tagus for the voyage along the west coast of Africa , his search for a new route to India. 123The water front was lively with buntings and ensigns and a multitudethronged to cheer them away . A bombard roared and the crowd danced its excitement . ( Aye , poor Palos and mean , this glory you should have witnessed , you who wept or gawked in silence when we departed you for The Discoverythat frayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowsy lanes into a busy roadstead . ) The flagship of Diaz led the procession , her officers in splendiferous array on her quarter and the crew in boisterous babel on her main deck . The Rabbit sulked his envy that our Santa Maria was rocked by the wake of Portugal 's adverturers and he , munching olives , spat the seed into their Tagus and mouthed his contempt . " They will drop off the end of the earth and good riddance and may their widows drop seven bastards each in commemoration of their extinction . " " There is no end of the earth . " In the excitement of the spectacle I forgot myself and attempted remonstrance with the little imp , and took an olive from his hand and held it up . " Aroint , long ears ! It is thus . " I coursed the olive . " If you sail down this side and keep sailing , you will come up this side . There is no shelf on the earth . There is no end . " " Dominican proficiency . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face contorted into a grimace and he snatched the olive from my fingers and popped it into his mouth . " There is an end to everything . " Arcos ' elbows were rested on the rail and his chin was on his hands , and he disdained our duologue but studied the Portuguese caravels , and his sharp eyes raked them from bow to stern and to topsail . " See you , Lepe . " He nudged his elbow deep in my side and pointed to the quarter-deck of Diaz ' ship . " That wheel . They steer with a wheel and their helmsman has sea and sun . " " More witchery , " The Rabbit said . " It will not do . A helmsman must handle the tiller . It has been ever thus . " " But it does do , " Arcos said . " These foreigners are clever , aye , Lepe ? " " At least they know the world is round . " I gave my back to The Rabbit and shaded my eyes and conned the quarter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wheel and through the deck to the tiller . Hence a turn of the wheel pulled the ropes , obviouslythrough blocks , and maneuvered the tiller . It was as simple as that , merely blocks and stanchions to anchor them , and ropes and a wheel . Now this was a worthy discovery and a thing that well might bring profit and honor to me . And , of course , to Arcos who had noticedit first . X24We remained on deck until Diaz ' expedition was around a point and the multitude was thinning , and then we fell to and began unloading , and this enterprise with a will and a song as we were hungry for home . We took on a legal cargo of wine , cheaper and more plentifulhere than in Andalusia , and ten blackbirds , and these contraband , and departed that orderly and thriving city on the flood , running with a flaming brazier at our bow as a signal that we were under way and must not be headed . The Rabbit put powder and shot in our falconet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Portuguese bastard , frisky in the triumph of Diaz ' voyage , cut our bow to gloat and jeer the insularism of mighty Spain . We were not spaken all the way to the sea , and for this a candle to our ship 's saint , as The Rabbit had neglected to wad the falconet and a spark might have blown me into the arms of my Gothic forebears and all of us into the hateful embrace of the grisly Moerae . The strong arms of Arcos , and his weight and skill at the tiller , held us true across the shank of the bar , and the tide ebbing , and then we were in the Saltes again and inbound for Palos ; the Santa Maria creakingin every joint . Our anchor ripples still were running when the merchant hagglers put out to board us and from them I heard my first news of Spain in several months , and this the fiasco of Christopher Columbus in his appearance before the Commission of Learned Men at Salamanca . And now , just reader , let us tarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend the triumph and tragedy of ChristopherColumbus , an enlightenment possible only if you are capable of probity and can withstand the din of his deific advocates , many of whom have gilded the Columbus legend for personal gains , and the man 's spirit scarcely risen . Under the patronage of some of the most powerful forces in the kingdom , including the Franciscans , the adventurer had been presented to the Queen , and , glib as a street hawker , had made a likely impression upon Isabel because they had similar temperaments , a proclivityfor enterprise and an abundance of Catholic missionary zeal , and both willing to hazard a flame at each end of the candle and t hemselves aglow with grandiose schemes . The Queen entered his name on her royal accounts to the amount of approximately 63,000 maravedis a year and instructed that he be garbed appropriately , and then appointed the Commission to examine his plans and report to her ; and this Commission under the directionrz5of Fray Hernando de Talavera , the Queen 's own confessor and a renownedHieronymite , which is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind you , this Commission of Learned Men was not charged to approve or reject Columbus ' plans , but only to hear them and counsel Isabel . This was done . The petitioner was no friendless wayfarer pleading his dream to skeptical professors . He had influential partisans at his side and his premise to the Commission was that India was only a caravel 's voyage west of Spain and that he could reach it . This , naturally , the Commission could not accept because it was not true . The earth is small , he argued , and India is beyond the horizon , perhaps only 700 leagues . The earth is large , they replied , and India is half a world away . He presented no maps , no charts , and this most singular , inasmuch as he had a copy of Toscanelli 's map , purloined or not , and possibly the Marino map . Columbus offered no proof or argument whatsoever , only his adamant contention : " India is across the Ocean Sea and I can reach it . " Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by The Discoverer 's idolaters , who would make him a saint instead of a sailor : that the Commission disputed the shape of the world with Columbus . This , of course , is ludicrous nonsense . The scholars did not dismiss the petitioner , but did as they were charged and heard his claim and advised the Queen that he was a mystic of magnetic personality and staunch in his dream that he could accomplish a miracle and find India where India could not possibly be . They advised her that zeal , courage , and hope were his attributes and that whereas his knowledge of geography was deficient he was a man of infinite conviction in his own destiny and that the gate should never be barred to a possible miracle . So there it stood when I returned to Spain . The Queen had taken Columbus ' cause under consideration and he was back in Cordova , her protege and pensioner and augmenting this emolument by the sale of maps that he and his brother , Bartholomew , designed and executed . He could be found almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the loiterers there and exhorting his bent to all who would heed , and these not many , for Cordova was a place of dreary insularism and her people of no mind for dreams of the Indies , but concerned only with matters at hand : 126the Moorish War , the Inquisition , and the clamor of the populace against all Jews , even those who strove to lull the heaving waves by opening their purses to good works and giving eloquence to pleas for mercy and justice . I was paid z8,000 maravedis for the long voyage , the master rewardingme this stipend in gold excelentes , and I , joyfully affluent , was intent upon a return to Seville to see my father and old Mudarra , but first I must have good raiment that Seville might know I had done well . I priced a doublet and the seamer was most insistent that I buy , promising me the garment in a week , and there in his shop , fingering the velvets and silks , I remembered the admonition of Fray Juan that day he deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never again will you wear a velvet doublet until you have earned it . " Well , I had earned it . Nevertheless , I did not settle the transaction , there being a troublesometug at my conscience , and I departed the shop and my promise to return did not still the laments of the tailor . I took myself therewith to Gallego 's place , and this most fortunate as there were two letters from my father , the first that all was well and the second that he was journeying into Granada to seek army contracts , particularly medicines and meat . The medicines I understood , he being a dealer in aloes , but the meat surprised nre , and this indicatingeither that he had come upon a supply of beef or must find one , and this , in turn , being evidence that his pottery and aloes business was not healthy . Anyway , my father was in Granada and a visit to Seville would have been useless , and so my gratitude to God that I had not wasted my opulence on the doublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor . The Rabbit was at Gallego 's , dissipating his weal on drink and , for truth , he had purchased a gift for the ordinary 's daughter , the dimwittedbed warmer for my comrade , who customarily had naught for her except kicks and curses and only such manliness that Palos ' whores did not consume . The token was a shawl of India cotton and she was piteously proud and flaunted herself before the winebibbers , and The Rabbit smirking his devilish perversity . I declined his invitation to revelry and rid myself of the beard and filth of the voyage and then straightway to Martin Pinzon 's establishment . Yes , he had seen my father and had delivered the aloes and my father most proud of his son 's devotion . Aye , my father seemed in excel-127lent health , albeit of gloomy humors because business was wretched . The pottery market was glutted and aloes were scarce and , aye , he had heard my father comment that he proposed to seek army contracts for meat . No , he had no inkling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent trader , Rodrigo , and if beef is available he will find it . " Half of my excelentes I put on his desk and requested him to send them to Mudarra by Merchants ' Post with instructions that they be held for my father and , aware that Pinzon was impressed by my earnestness , I broached him the matter of the steering apparatus I had seen on Diaz ' ships . " Now that is a Portuguese feat of much merit , " I said , and reached for quill and paper and demonstrated how I could equip the Niebla 's caravels with the innovation . I would secure two stanchions and to these attach blocks , thence ropes to the tiller and through the blocks and up to a wheel on the quarter . Pinzon smiled at my enthusiasm and then shook his head . " I charter the ships I sail , " he explained . " All except one small craft that I own and which I lease to the sardine fishermen of Lepe . Should I suggest this novelty of your imagination to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to install it , but surely they would increase the charter fees . It is not good business , Rodrigo . " He picked up the quill and returned it to its well . " I can hire helmsmen for 7000 maravedis a month , and that is that . " My disappointment , I am sure , was obvious , as I had hoped to convertmy design into ducats and thereby lessen my father 's worries . Alonso Pinzon perceived my disillusion and put his hand on my arm and spoke kindly , " There is nothing wrong with your father 's business that aloes will not correct . " " Aye , sir , " I replied and frowned my impatience at the platitude . " Aloes will cure anything . But where the aloes ? " " You fetched aloes on your first voyage . " " Captain Pinzon . " I drew myself erect and was taller than he , and rested my hand on my poniard in a most seamanly manner . " Please do me the honor that my intelligence justifies . The aloes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trafficking save for the owner , the master , and the merchant . " He studied me intently , his black eyes steady on my face . " Then come with me . " " Trafficking ? " I demanded boldly . " No . To the Mediterranean ports . I have chartered the Nina . " He picked up my gold excelentes and jingled them in his hand . " Leave128these with me and I will buy for you . Also , I will hold back one half of your pay and invest it . But only in aloes , and in the licit markets of Italy . " " You are most kind , sire , " I said and was deeply touched by his fatherly interest in me . His smile was quick and warm . " Most sailors are wastrels , Rodrigo . I-Ience my presumption in this affair . I need your shoulders and capacityon my ships and for these I will exchange my acumen in the markets . " " I will not impose upon your friendship for my father . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I was eager to sail with him . " It is a matter of business , " he assured me . " I have need of you and you have need of me . The Nina sails on the moon change . It will be a long voyage . " " Arcos ? " I asked . " Aye . Arcos . " " The Rabbit ? " He smiled again , then nodded . " The Rabbit . " In a buoyant ado , I pressed upon him all of my earnings , save keep money , and he insisted that I retain one excelente for the wine I might need . I was in debt to Arcos when we boarded the Nina and I took the knife of Martin Alonso Pinzon , my vow to his service and my pledge to his discipline , and Arcos , Rascon , and I were given the port watch and then Arcos to his tiller , The Rabbit to the pot , and Ito the rigging . " Blessed be the light of day And the Holy Cross , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity . " The dawn song and we sang it out , and Andalusia 's east pinking and our anchors sucking mud . But up with them ! And down the Tinto again , down the Saltes and across the bar , then an easy port rudder and The Little Girl scudded off Playa de Castilla , past the delta of the muddy Guadalquivir that winded inland to my Seville , past Cadiz and hard for Cabo Trafalgar , the Strait , and the Pillars of Hercules . To our starboard was Africa , rugged and green and misty , and there Tangier of Portuguese pretension and Moorish domination , ancient when history was new , and named for Tinge , who wedded Neptune's129son ; and there the Gardens of the Hesperides , whence Hercules stole the golden fruit ' and therewith gave oranges to Europa . The Strait was shallow , the path of Hercules , who cleft the mountainthat separated the Mediterranean from the Ocean Sea and builded the pillars that bear his name , and this watercourse the most important in all the world , for its shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as all men know , is the cradle of mankind . True into the Strait we sailed , our Nina pitching and squirming , and the mist shrouded Tangier and the African coast . ( Magna civitas , magna solitudo . Ah-h-h , Tangier , thou gem of antiquityand my prison of iniquity , for I sit today in Tangier , penning my story ; I an exile , I an old man of many vineyards , but I find no pleasure in them ; I an old man of many maidens and , woe to years , no delight thereof , for I had Mita and God never has given man a taste for watered wine after a feast of plenty . My house is marble . My slaves are fat . But all this would I trade , and gladly , to cross yon finger of the sea and to my Andalusia once more . The water is gray on this morn and the clouds low , and yon  --  I point my finger to remember  --  and yon the Strait where our Nina sailed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever befell mortal man : I saw it first . ) The lateen sails of our ship caused her to yaw most disgustingly in a steady wind aft and Arcos labored to exhaustion to hold her true . We were compelled to lower and hoist at the slightest shift and we roundly cursed her owner , who was too stingy to rig her squarely , but through the Strait we beat and into the Mediterranean , the Middle Sea  --  our sea . An ebb , a flow , and each so gentle that it was days before we noticed it , being bred to tides , and this a lake , saltier than the sea , greenish at anchorage and heavenly blue at great depth , shadowing to purple in the first wind of storm . We stood well off from the coast of Granada to avoid Moors , then around Cabo de Gata to Spanish water again and by Cabo de Palos , and this name a joy to us , and into Valencia , where our master began trading , this being a dry land of abundant wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The Rabbit made for the first wineshop he sighted and I , more in curiosity than in remembrance , inquired if the name of Harana were known thereabouts , and it was not . Also , there were no aloes in Valencia and Pinzon traded in rope'Tangerines. and we were away before The Rabbit had chance to teach his selectedmaidens the art of Andalusian lusting . Around the coast to Barcelona , and then France , and Pinzon tradingin every port and driving us as I had never been driven before ; he in a frenzy , aye , a mania of profit taking : almonds and olives , wine and wheat , rope and leather , but no aloes to be had and me distraught in this knowledge , and the master driving on . Aloes ? Aloes ? He asked in Marseille . No aloes . So we took horsehides instead . Corsica and Sardinia and into the Tyrrhenian Sea , then up to Genoa and I forgot that hence came Christopher Columbus , or so they say . His name never crossed my memory and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my humors melancholy in the conviction that aloes were not obtainable , that I was in for a long , long voyage under a hard master . My determination for enterprise and decorum melted in the tedium and even the stalwart Arcos gave way to man 's bestial bent and we sowed our seed and wined our thirst at every call . " Clear the scuppers , Leper ' It sounded in Florence . " Clear the scuppers , Rabbit ! " That was in Pisa . ( The scar on my shoulder is a memento from an unreasonable husband in Livorno , the one whose ribs I parted with a single thrust . This scar high on my forehead is a souvenir of Piombino , where The Rabbit left his poniard in a Tuscan 's back , then stole a better knife in Syracuse . ) Rome was bloated decay and there The Rabbit bought a bundle of sticks to be sold in Spain as splinters from the True Cross and Arcos and I visited the ruins and wearied of them . Women were cheaper in Naples than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed past in musty senescence , and the months flowed into seasons and the seasons into a year , and Pinzon was a master possessed of profit fever and his crew lean and gaunt and threatening desertion ere he spake us from his quarter : " We are for home , my hearties . We stand for Palos . " Most of the men were too sullen to cheer , but The Rabbit leaped to the half deck and jigged . " By the boils on Job ! You have decided well , Captain Pinzon , else the pining misery of Andalusia 's maids be on your conscience. 130 131Alonso Pinzon shouted down to Arcos to bring her about and the great tiller creaked and the rudder also , and The Little Girl bowed her nose for home and there was a song in the rigging and a chant from the deck . I was summonsed to the quarter and the captain returned my investment , together with my accumulated pay , and was most regretful that he had been unable to obtain aloes for me . This whim of fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to allay his dejection , I spake cheerfully . " It has been a profitable voyage for you , aye , sire ? We have traded hard and now go home with a hold of good Italian wheat . " He conned the binnacle and , serving as pilot , called the course down to Arcos , then looked up at me . " I drove all of you too hard . The voyage was too long . Nineteen months from home . Too long . " He stared across the starboard bow at the coast line of Italy and chewed his lower lip . " Profit ? Aye . But not enough . It will cost 4,200,000 maravedis to charter and equip two caravels for an expeditionacross the Ocean Sea . Neither I nor my family has that sum . This voyage was not enough . " Mother of Mary and Mary the mother ! So that explained the backand-forthtrading in Italian cities , the Nina beaten and the men beaten . Alonso Pinzon needed money to go exploring . He had maps from the Pope 's library and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know now that it was not gold that held my captain from the UnknownSea . It was a fault of imagination , a demerit of vision , a want of conviction of his own destiny . He was the greatest sailor I ever knew , and this truth into the teeth of the toadies of Christopher Columbus ; but he would not challenge the Fates although Christopher Columbus , the Christ-bearer Dove , spat his dare into the hideous faces of Hell 's Three Sisters . I could not deny the words on my tongue and let them fall . " CaptainPinzon , the Niebla will furnish ships for you , and this you know . And rest this crew for a month and we will sail you to Polaris if you chart the course . " Instead of dismissing me as an impudent sailor , he argued with me . " My maps are not sufficient . " " There is always Benjamin Marino , " I said . " He can be commissionedto draw maps . " " Marino is a Jew and all Jews in Spain are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may order a new exodus . " The import of this did not penetrate immediately as my mind was132on maps . " Bartholomew Columbus is a good map maker . I have scene his work --  " " Bartholomew Columbus is not in Spain . This , too , I learned iu Rome . " Pinzon glanced at his compass and shouted the course down to Arcos . " Bartholomew Columbus is back in Portugal . He has been to France and England to peddle his brother 's scheme to those king- ! doms . " " And Christopher Columbus ? " I immediately was interested . " Still in Cordova , the last I heard . And growing moss on his backsidewhile the Queen mulls his case and Ferdinand smites the Moors . " " She has been mulling a long time . " The Nina was yawing againand I felt Arcos steady her . " Too long I fear . " " Then Bartholomew has interested France ? Or England ? " I was vexed by the thought that either of those backward realms might act while Spain faltered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he is in it Portugal now and that kingdom has ears for any reasonable plan of exploration . If Christopher Columbus will lower his price , Portugal will sponsor him tomorrow . " " Will he lower it ? " Now there was mirth in my captain 's laugh . " By the five wounds ! No ! His garments are threadbare . He grows gaunt and wrinkled . But he will not compromise one mote . Instead of bargaining , the man raises his price every time he is questioned . A simpleton or a sage , this Christopher Columbus . " He glanced quickly at the sky , then at his compass . " The wind shifts . To your watch , Rodrigo . " The voyage home was accursed and ere we raised Gibralter the rats were as thick as weevils in our hold and the vermin so thick in our beards that our faces seemed to crawl . Arcos took us across the bar into the roadstead of our Niebla and we crept up the Saltes to the Tinto and there fortune nailed us down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too swift for our sweeps . We anchored off La Rabida for the wind to change and Palos heard of our return and many friends came down and lined the riverbankand waved at us . Our captain 's two brothers , Francisco and Vicente Pinzon , rowed out to the Nina and greeted us with praises of " bravo , " then to seclusion and talk with the master . We lolled on the main deck , impatient at our luck , and soon the Pinzons joined us and gave us news of home , and their faces troubled by events of which we knew naught. 133The Moorish stronghold of Malaga had fallen to Ferdinand 's armies and Spain slowly was strangling Granada into submission , and all the country in a turmoil against aliens , and an alien was any person who was not a Christian . " Praise God and the Queen , " The Rabbit shouted . " She will cleanse our homeland of circumcision and chicanery . " " She will rob Spain of brains and purse , " growled the helmsman of our starboard watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever and every city was celebrating Faggot Day and jeering heretics into the fire 's embrace . No man cheered this report . We were sailors and we hated fire . If death must settle for heresy , let it be a good rope from a crossarm and God 's breeze to cool the spirit before its eternal torment . A cry was sounding throughout the realm to exile all professed Jews from Spain and already many had departed Andalusia , being torn from their homes and shipped to Africa and their property confiscated . " Good riddance , " The Rabbit gibed . " Their depravity is a pesti-lence . " " Close your hatch , " Arcos snarled . " It is sinful to deprive any man of his home , and the Jews have been with us forever . " " And that is too long , " The Rabbit taunted . " By the Christian blood they drink , that is too long . " " Silence . " The order came from our captain and then he addressed his brothers . " Tell the men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Several asked it . " That Portuguese bastard . Did his ships fall off the rim of the earth ? " The three Pinzons exchanged glances and Francisco , the youngest of the family , spake out : " Bartholomew Diaz has sailed to the southernmostcape of Africa and back . A route is open to India . " Arcos whistled his amazement , sucking wind fast between his lips , and we all were stunned , and I by the real significance of the news . " Diaz reached the tip of Africa and named it Good Hope . " Our captain now was speaking . " The way to India is open to Christian trade , and Portugal succeeded while Spain talked . " My mind went out to Fray Juan Ruiz de Medina and to Benjamin Marino , who had looked west instead of south , and then , for truth , my sympathy went out to Christopher Columbus , who had waited too long , and my disgust to our Crowns , who had pinned him down . I was leaning against the port anchor winch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast , aye , masters ? And this clips the feather from the cap of Christopher Columbus . " 134 " Aye , Lepe . " Vicente Pinzon nodded agreement and waved his hand toward the shore and La Rabida on the hill . " He is there , the nobody . Visiting his son , Diego . " Arcos spake and shrugged his broad shoulders in unconcern of fortune 's rebuke to Christopher Columbus . " He should have remained in Portugal . Spain has dallied his cause --  " " While he diddled in Cordova . " Francisco Pinzon could not deny the witticism . " Spain has given him solace if not support , for he found a mistress in Cordova ; a converso maiden who has borne him a bastard son . " Named for a Franciscan , I will wager , " The Rabbit jeered . " Or for the King . " " A mark ! " Vicente Pinzon laughed . " He has named his colt Ferdinandin honor of the saint , albeit the name of our sovereign , who has the seed of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , smiled and joined the levity . " By the navel of Adam . Our homeless Dove came to Spain to find the Indies and found an indention . I will wager he needed no map for that enterprise . " My fellows roared at my wit and Francisco Pinzon chuckled deep in his belly . " His bed help is most comely and meet , I hear . The name of Harana . " The gasp rasped my throat and my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth and I sucked it free and shouted the name . " Harana ! " All the ship 's company stared at me and Francisco Pinzon was startled by my vehement agitation . " Aye , Lepe . Harana . The woman is Beatriz Enriquez Harana . A respectable family in Cordova . " The seizure departed my heart . Then it was not Maraela . A kinswoman , perhaps . She had gone to live with kin . My gaze moved from Francisco Pinzon to La Rabida there on the hill , to the monastery that sheltered Christopher Columbus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fates be kind. ' 35C H A P T E R 12LONSO PINZON GRANTED ME PERMISSION TO GO ASHORE AFTERI explained that , for personal reasons , I had urgent need of communication with Christopher Columbus , and I rowed alone to the foot of La Rabida 's hill and then walked up the slope to the Franciscan friary . The bell clapper had rusted and broken and I rapped on the door and it was opened by Fray Juan Perez himself and he scrutinized my bearded face and calloused feet and bade me enter , and this I did ; my gorro in my hand and my sailor 's smock tattered from the arduous voyage . I bowed gallantly to establish that my breeding was more than that of a common seaman and asked his leave for audience with the renowned Christopher Columbus , and for an instant the Franciscan hesitated and I said , " I am this day returned from Rome . " " Ah-h . With Captain Pinzon . " He entwined his fingers and revolvedhis thumbs . " It is a joy to hear one so young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a man of renown , and a shame on Spain that our blessed realm dawdles his enterprise . " Fray Perez motioned me to a bench . " And , now , may I ask the name of the mariner who hastens directly from Pinzon 's caravel to seek audiencewith this monastery 's guest ? " " You may , " I said with a delicate inflection of hauteur . " I am Lepe , a sailor , and my business with the thwarted Christopher Columbus is of a personal nature . " Again he studied me closely and I sensed that his curiosity was whetted and that his bent was for converse with me . " Our guest is at matin , " he said . " He is a man most pious . We will wait here , you and I. " The wile was artless and wholly unworthy of a man so nimble in artifice . I was vexed by his nosy deportment and elected to best him and perhaps teach him a lesson in Dominican stratagem . I spread my legs wide in a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man can not long remain in this blessed spot and in this worthy presence without feeling the need of piety 's virtue . Therefore , brother , I request the sanctity of your chapel for my Contrition . " He looked at me in unfeigned admiration and smiled . " Follow me . " There was naught else he could say and yet he added , " An Act of Contrition is a fitting end to a long voyage . " Fray Juan Perez ( and he an iron link in the chain that Columbus swung from Spain to the New World ) led me down a corridor , thence along a cloister and to the chapel , and that holy place in calm shadows . My vision , accustomed to bright sun , was impaired by the gloom and I felt my way to a prayer stool and there knelt and was conscious of men all around me , some telling their beads and others mumbling penances . I made my Contrition and then five Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys , and these to my father and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slightly and glanced around ; and there he was , his head bowed to a statue of the Virgin and his broad shoulders garbed in the gray of Franciscans . The first time I saw Christopher Columbus he was praying . My eyes adjusted to the shadows and I audited the contour of his face , first the bold , hawked nose and then the high cheekbones and the stern mouth and thin lips . His hair was as white as clean sea foam , and fleecy , like a summer cloud over Andalusia 's hills . He was but thirty-seven the first time I saw him ; the frost-hair of an old man and the restless eyes blue as the steel of my Toledo poniard . He was taller than his brother , as tall as I , and I am quite tall for a Spaniard , we being a breed that measures our strength in enterprise rather than in inches . I watched him beat his breast thrice and then he arose and stepped by me and to the door of the chapel . There Fray Juan Perez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nodded toward me , and I joined them in the cool recess of the cloister . " This is Lepe , a sailor . " The friar presented me to him and that was proper inasmuch as I was the younger , albeit of equal station . The acute blue eyes , sheltered by long lashes and bristling brows , darted from my face to my feet . " By San Fernando ! " he growled peevishly . " Does he need a compass for a nose to identify his trade ? It is obvious that he is a sailor . " Forsooth . The first words I heard from the cunning lips of ChristopherColumbus were an oath. 137There were spaces between his upper teeth and a gap at the left corner of his mouth , where two lower teeth were missing , and this affected his speech a minim , and he hissed certain consonant syllables . Immediately I discerned him as a dogmatist to be accosted forthrightly , that if given an upper hand he would press instinctively , that he was not one for the niceties or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be enlightened that my gorro was not an emblem of servility , it behooved me to flick my tongue , and this sharply . " Your observation , sire , is more pertinent than your irreverence . " His ruddy face twitched his surprise and his demeanor changed spontaneously , and this an indication that he was not sure of himself or of my station . I might be a personage and in the early days The Discoverer was a veritable chameleon , never trodding toes of any man who might farther his ambition . His bow was polite , almost Spanish , and he directed it to the friar . " Your forgiveness , my brother . I am distraught , as you know . " Then he addressed me . " Your pleasure , young man . " I vacillated not , but went straight to the point . " You have been in Cordova ? " An expression of bland imperturbation came to his face and he replied warily , " And if I have ? " Now you will heed that he did not answer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he rarely ever answered a question straightforwardly , but , as a rule , asked one . My mission was honorable and there was no need for guile . Hence , I hued to the line and spake frankly . " My father is a merchant in Seville and , for family and business reasons , I seek an old friend . The name is Harana . " Fray Juan Perez glared at me and Columbus ' eyes narrowed perceptibly . " Harana ? " I was annoyed by the repetition as I had spoken plainly , and this I did again . " That is correct , sire . Harana . " " Aye , " he nodded and revealed no emotion whatsoever . " I have the privilege of friendship with a Harana family in Cordova . " " The one I seek is Luis I-Iarana , merchant . " " Luis Ilarana ? Merchant ? " He frowned as he searched his memory and then shook his head . " I do not know Luis Harana . " " He has a daughter . Maraela . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was a truth and I weened it as a truth and yet I persisted in the hope of refreshing his memory . " They are conversos , sire . " 138A flush surged to his face and he was seized of reckless anger . " I Told ! The Haranas of Cordova are not conversos . This is slander and the tongue of slander is more evil than the assassin 's dagger -- - " Hold , yourself ! " I planted my feet firmly and rested my fists on my hips . " The Haranas I seek are conversos and a family of most envious repute . " The friar raised his hands for silence and addressed his guest . " Patience , Christopher . The young man uttered no slander . It is obvious that he seeks a different family . " Then he put his hand on my arm . " I know the Haranas of Cordova . There is Pedro de Harana and his sister , Beatriz Enriquez Harana , who are orphans and live with a kinsman , Rodrigo Enriquez de Harana . " Beatriz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , but these names had no meaning to me . " And they are not conversos , " Columbus said and still in spirited agitation . " Oh , come now , Christopher , " Fray Juan Perez said soothingly . " You are making a mountain out of an ant heap . All Cordova knows that Pedro and Bcatriz are the children of Pedro Torquemada and that when their parents died they took the name of their mother , who was a Harana . " " Torquemada ? " I asked politely . " Did I hear aright ? It is a powerful name in Spain . " " You heard aright , " the Franciscan nodded . " Pedro Torquemada was a kinsman of our Inquisitor-General . " Now here was a fillip , a choice morsel indeed . The mistress of Christopher Columbus was a kinswoman of the Inquisitor-General and , by the Thirty Pieces , Torquemada himself was a descendant of a famous converso family , one of these being the Cardinal of St. Sixt . The friar apparently kenned the implication of my smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Torquemada is of converso strain . Aye . But several generations removed . " " It is meaningless , " Columbus said and the flush remained on his countenance . " By such reasoning the Virgin Herself was a converso . Even our Savior , and the Apostles . They all were born Jews . " Ile threw up his hands in a gesture of exasperation and stalked away . I watched him walk down the cloister and he had none of the swinging gait of a sailor and then I shrugged my indifference . " He is sensitive . Perhaps more sensitive than sensible . " " He is sorely pressed , young man . " Fray Juan Perez took my
