HRs // Baltimore 0.81 // Pittsburgh 0.85 // NATIONAL LEAGUE // The San Francisco Giants got the kind of hitting they were supposed to get all along and rolled to their biggest lead of the year ( four games ) . In winning four in a row , Manager Rigney 's young bulls banged out 49 hits , had big innings all over the place . Willie McCovey started his second trip around the league and the pitchers still have n't figured him out . He 's batting .395 and has averaged an RBI a game . The Los Angeles Dodgers were crippled by more bad pitching . Not one starter was able to finish in 16 straight games ; ten of these games were losses . In two weeks the Dodgers had just about dropped out of contention ( they fell from a half game out to 4 ? games behind ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ( ruptured ligament in right ankle ) just when he was starting to hit again . They also lost three more games ( Spahn lost one of them starting and one relieving ) and fell further back ( see page 14 ) . " I 've racked my brains trying to figure it out , " said Manager Haney . " I 've had several meetings with the players in the hope that that might shake them out of it . But nothing seems to work . I told them they should look in the mirror and think to themselves why we are n't winning this time . I 've tried everything to get these guys to play like I know they can . " The Pittsburgh Pirates still are n't getting much hitting . But the pitching has been sound and the team won 10 out of 13 games . Even Bob Friend started to win again . He has two in a row now . The Cincinnati Reds , who are held back only by a weak pitching staff , got encouraging work from two 22-year-old rookies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . " Hook 's starting to get confidence , " said Manager Hutchinson . " That 's what he needed . " Frank Robinson and Vada Pinson ( see page 45 ) continued to pound away . Pinson went 11 for 28 and Robby had 12 hits , 10 RBIs and four home runs . The Chicago Cubs stopped cold as Ernie Banks went into a slump . He had only four singles and no RBIs in 29 at bats , and the Cubbies dropped six out of seven . The St. Louis Cardinals lost six out of eight games and just about clinched seventh place . Some good pitching was wasted when the Cards could score only 12 runs in the six losing games . It was a long , hot week for the Philadelphia Phillies . They played three twi-night double-headers in as many days and were lucky to come out with two wins and a tie . As if to emphasize what kind of a season it 's been for the Phils , Gene Conley broke a finger while winning a brilliant three-hit game . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SF 71-52 , Mil 67-56 , LA 68-58 , Pitt 64-61 , Cin 61-64 , Chi 58-64 , StL 57-70 , Phil 52-73. // AMERICAN LEAGUE // The Chicago White Sox pennant chase slowed down to a walk as they lost five out of nine games . " It 's the defense I 'm fretting over now , " said Manager Lopez . " We 've been going bad at third base . Balls have been going through our infield which should have been handled easily . That sort of play can make the pitching look bad . " The Cleveland Indians ran off six in a row when the pitching suddenly became spectacular : Grant , Perry and Harshman all threw three-hitters . Lefthander Jack Harshman , in particular , has given the team a big lift . A flop with the Orioles and Red Sox earlier in the year , he has won three straight games since joining the Indians last month . The Indians are very much alive again . The New York Yankees , rehearsing now for next year , inserted 22-year-old Cletis Boyer at short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful double-play combination . Hector Lopez , feeling more at home in left field , went off on one of his periodic batting streaks . The Baltimore Orioles got tough against the White Sox and took two out of three . Then they rolled over for the Indians and Tigers and flopped into the second division . The Detroit Tigers won some , lost some and stayed comfortably in the middle of the league . After Paul Foytack was blasted from the mound within two innings by the Indians , he kicked the rosin bag around , flung his glove down repeatedly and threw his cap away . " If you 'd get that mad at the batters , " said Manager Dykes , " you 'd be a better pitcher . " The next day he started again against the Indians and beat them . Later in the week he used a new side-arm delivery and threw a four-hit shutout . The Kansas City Athletics got a lift from the revived Bob Cerv ( he pushed his batting average up some 20 points in two weeks ) but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sox have moved along at a winning .520 pace since Billy Jurges took over nearly two months ago ( they were playing losing .419 ball at that time ) . " He juggles us around like Stengel , " said Sammy White , " and with just as much success . He makes the right moves at the right time and he 's got the club winning . " The Washington Senators went back to their losing habits , after a brief win streak . Flashy-fielding Rookie Shortstop Zoilo Versalles had to be benched after two weeks of play . " Big league pitchers were knocking the bat out of his hands , " said Manager Lavagetto. // Standings : Chi 73-48 , Clev 73-52 , NY 62-62 , Det 61-63 , Balt 56-62 , KC 58-66 , Bost 57-67 , Wash 50-74. // Boxed statistics through Saturday , August 22
