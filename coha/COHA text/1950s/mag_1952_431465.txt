 | The woman who works at her job , plays tennis , or dances during her menstrual period is often unaware of her good fortune . She may not realize that she has escaped from the superstitions , restrictions , and fears that , for centuries , made her female forebears miserable about four hundred times during their lives . But an amazingly large number of intelligent women still do not understand the menstrual process . Menstruation is not , as many believe , the periodic purification of poisonous substances in the blood . It is the end result of nature 's preparations for pregnancy . These preparations begin in the ovaries . When a baby girl is born , she has many potential eggs ? perhaps 100,000 ? in each of her two ovaries . These eggs , or ova , are single cells enclosed in their own sacs , or nests , which are called follicles . Only after the child begins menstruating do these eggs mature . " Then , each month , one follicle swells as the egg it contains develops . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which enters the blood and prepares the lining of the uterus , or womb , in case the egg becomes fertilized and conception takes however , the egg is not fertilized , the yellow body stops work ; the egg dies ; the tissues that were ready for its care break down and are for the most part ejected ; and the bleeding known as menstruation takes place . The entire function is normal , but its manifestations vary not only from one woman to another but also from month to month in the same person . A girl usually begins to menstruate when she is twelve or thirteen years old ( the average age in this country is 13.8 ) , but she may start earlier or as late as sixteen or seventeen . The menopause usually occurs at forty-seven ; but some women experience it before forty , while others continue to menstruate until fifty . The interval between the beginning of one period and the beginning of the next is generally twenty-eight days ; but it may be twenty-five , twenty-six , thirty , or thirty-one days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from three to five days , but it may continue for only a day or two or for six or seven days . Usually , the longer the period , the more profuse the flow . Each woman has her own mysterious timing , and even that is subject to individual variation . Many factors cause irregularity . The cycle is uncertain at its beginning and end . It is not unusual for a child to place . At the same time , the nest walls become thinner , and about halfway between the two menstrual periods , they break and the ovum moves into the peritoneal cavity and then through the Fallopian tubes into the uterus . This is called ovulation . As a rule , only one egg is given off each month . After the egg has left its nest , the follicle changes color and acquires a carrotlike hue . For this reason , it is called a yellow body , or corpus luteum . It continues to get larger until the next menstrual period , and as it grows , it effects other changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progesterone , which together cause the uterine changes . If , menstruate once and then skip several months before menstruating again , or for a woman nearing fifty to go two or three or more months without a period . Irregularity may be caused by psychological factors , such as fear of , or desire for , pregnancy , and emotional stress ; many diseases , from tuberculosis to a common cold ; altitude or climate changes ; and endocrine conditions , especially over- or underfunctioning of the thyroid gland . If , however , there is a persistent change in the duration , frequency , or type of menstrual flow , the doctor should be consulted . The amount of flow has been estimated at from two to eight ounces , but there is no way of proving this . In some women it is scanty , in others considerable . Doctors try to judge by the number of pads a woman uses , but they must always consider their patients ' habits . A fastidious person uses a good many , an untidy one considerably fewer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some women prefer to use tampons instead of pads . It is often comfortable to use both while the flow is profuse and only a tampon when it tapers off . When tampons first came into use , there was a good deal of discussion as to whether or not they were safe . Today , the medical profession finds no objection to them ; there is no proof that their use predisposes to malignancy , blocks the flow , or causes cramps . Menstrual blood is dark in color and normally does not clot . It is believed that when it passes through the uterus , it is either robbed of some clotting factor or some material in the uterus counteracts normal clotting . However , the woman who menstruates profusely usually notices some clots . If heavy menstrual bleeding is due to a pelvic disease , the blood is bright red and often clots a good deal . This symptom should be reported to the doctor . Cleanliness is always a problem during the menstrual period . However , there is no reason for not using plenty of soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her physician approves . A douche helps , too , with the mucous discharge that appears in midcycle and often just before and after menstruation . If the discharge is not irritating , is insufficient to require the use of a pad , and has no local cause , it is normal . In the past , women thought they were semi-invalids during their periods . But the labels " the curse " and " unwell " are no longer valid . Physicians explain that any usual activity carries no risk . Very cold or very hot water might cause some discomfort ; but if a woman is normal and healthy , she can probably do whatever she likes . By and large , anyone is better off if she does not coddle herself unnecessarily . l Some women do suffer menstrual disturbances . These may be slight or so serious that they constitute a real handicap . The most common ones are premenstrual tension and painful menstruation . Quite often a woman feels depressed and miserable just before her period begins ; once the flow is under way , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her abdomen bloated . She may experience a dragging sensation in her pelvis , or have fits of weeping , severe headaches ,  | or even a troublesome nausea . These conditions are probably due to increasing levels ' of the hormones that are preparing for menstruation and to a fluid retention that sometimes accompanies that condition . If this premenstrual tension becomes oppressive or really interferes with daily life , the doctor can prescribe a helpful drug . Some women never suffer a painful period , though a little moderate discomfort is quite common . When the pain , which is called cramps , is so intense that it keeps a woman away from her job or makes household chores a hideous and sometimes impossible duty , it is best to see what medical science can do to alleviate or cure the condition . Examination may show that the cause is a pelvic condition ; a displaced or an inflamed uterus , which sometimes develops after childbirth ; a tumor ; or some disease or inflammation of the tubes or ovaries . All of these conditions can be cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes aspirin for serious cramps may be suffering unnecessarily or ignoring a potentially dangerous ailment . There may be , however , severe cramps for which the doctor can find no reason . In some instances , the cause may be psychological . A girl may have grown up in a home where her mother or older sisters regularly complained of cramps , and she may therefore believe they are inevitable . Or perhaps she does n't want to go to school or help her mother with household chores ; cramps are a good excuse , and they may be very real and persist throughout her life . When the doctor suspects that some such factor is causing the pain , he may use psychotherapy : talk to the girl , find out about her childhood and home , and after a few sessions with her , rationalize her out of her suffering . Sometimes the physician finds that his patient 's general health is not up to par . Then , in addition to the usual measures for building up her whole system , he advises her not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her normal routine . The objective here is to improve circulation and take the patient 's mind off her aches . In addition to this , the physician may prescribe a variety of drugs if he thinks them advisable . These may be antispasmodics or sedatives , or possibly a drug that gives an increased sense of well-being . ANOTHER menstrual disorder is lack of menstruation . This is not uncommon during adolescence . A young girl may skip several periods before ovulation and the menstrual cycle are finally established , or she may menstruate without ovulation ( this phenomenon sometimes occurs in later life , too ) . Not infrequently , a girl does not begin to menstruate at the usual age . The chances are she rs merely maturing later than the average girl . However , if she has not begun her periods by the time she is fifteen , it is wise to consult a doctor . This is especially true if she has such symptoms as cramps or backaches , which may indicate that she has normal menstrual function without escape of blood . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition : a thick and fibrous hymen , no opening in the cervix , or , very rarely no vagina . Whatever the cause , the physician can usually correct it . But it is important to discover it early ; the longer it persists , the less chance there is of establishing normal menstruation . Pregnancy , obviously , is the most common cause of lack of menstruation . However , breast feeding often suppresses the function after the baby is born A great many women still believe that because they are not menstruating while they are nursing , they can not conceive . This is definitely untrue . OCCASIONALLY , glandular trouble causes lack of menstruation . Recent scientific discoveries about the endocrine system and new diagnostic methods are of great help in finding the basis of many menstrual disorders and in treating them effectively . The thyroid , the ovaries , or the pituitary may be responsible . When a doctor discovers which gland is at fault , he can deal with the situation in a number of ways . If he suspects the thyroid , he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serum iodine level in the blood , or a radioactiveiodine study . If the pituitary is at fault , he knows other factors are involved , for the pituitary is the master gland of the endocrine system . Therefore , he often concentrates his attention on the glands it controls , such as the ovaries . If he suspects that they are responsible for lack of menstruation , he may take a smear from the vagina lining and study it in the laboratory , as ovary disorders affect the vagina lining . If the smear does not tell the story fully , he snips a bit of tissue from the uterus to determine whether or not it is being properly stimulated by the ovarian hormones . When the doctor discovers the cause of lack of menstruation , he treats the patient by replacement therapy : he prescribes a dosage of whichever hormone appears to be naturally insufficient . Although this is not always effective , it usually produces a flow of blood that is not normal menstruation . Occasionally , however , normal menstruation does follow this replacement therapy . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by too much . This may manifest itself either in excessive daily flow or in abnormally extended periods . Too much menstruation is not a disease but a symptom . It , may indicate some organic disease , polyps , ovarian cysts , - fibroid tumors , ovarian tumors , or a malignancy , and the doctor treats the causative condition . Quite often , however , the physician can not discover any cause for excessive menstruation . He then tells the patient that she suffers from " dysfunctional uterine bleeding . " This label means that no organic disease can be found . Excessive menstruation may occur just before or during change of life . As the ovaries slowly cease to function , the other glands readjust themselves so that they can operate without the ovaries . During this period of readjustment , the other glands sometimes work overtime and cause too much bleeding . As blood loss can cause real trouble at any time of life , the physician takes  | measures to reduce or stop it . One treatment involves the use of male or female hormones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may do a curettage and clean up the uterus lining . This disrupts the cycle and temporarily controls the bleeding . Or he may control the ovaries ' function with small doses of radium or by X ray . The doctor does not use all these treatments for each person , or expect lasting results , but he may have to try two of them . If none of them works , he may , for seriously debilitating bleeding , advise removal of the uterus . For women who have had their children , this operation is not so grim as it sounds . It does not put an end to the ovaries ' functioning ; it merely makes a woman unable to menstruate or become pregnant . No woman should ever ignore excessive or frequent menstruation . As we have seen , it may be caused by any number of factors . But it is also a symptom of cancer . The doctor always considers this before he looks for other causes . Prompt attention to this symptom saves lies . However , no woman should wait for a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often there are are no observable signs when this disease is in a curable stage ; hence the need for periodic examinations . Most menstruation is normal . The healthy , intelligent woman takes this period in her stride . She forgets any old wives ' tales she has heard , and she never repeats them to her daughters . Instead , she explains to them the reason for menstuation and the rules of hygiene to follow during their periods .
