( See Cover ) <P> The world entered 1956 with a full complement of great men : national leaders , statesmen , philosophers , artists and scientists , many of whom , pursuing their legitimate vocations , would be remembered among the great names of the epoch . But the man who put his stamp on this particular year-the Man of the Year-was not on the roster of the world 's great when the year began . Nor could anyone have guessed his identity , even when the year had run four-fifths of its course . Yet by year 's end , this man was seen to have shaken history 's greatest despotism to its foundations . <P> The ultimate consequences of his action could only be assessed in the future . But the effect upon European political and military alignments was already stupendous . He had actually lowered , by some 80 divisions , the combat potential of the world 's most menacing army by showing that its colonial conscripts could no longer be relied upon . The Kremlin 's current irresolution owes much to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Bulganin and Khrushchev , because of him , could not now expect to be received at Buckingham Palace or make the same kind of laughing-boy junket through Asia , and all over Western Europe , disillusioned Communist sympathizers turned away in nausea . Destroyed also was the 1984 fantasy that a whole generation could be taught to believe that wrong was right , or could be emptied of all integrity and curiosity . But his greatest triumph was moral : he demonstrated the profound and needful truth that humanity is not necessarily forever bound and gagged by modern terrorist political techniques . Thus he gave to millions , and specifically to the youth of Eastern Europe , the hope for a foreseeable end to the long night of Communist dictatorship . <P> The Man of the Year had many faces , but he was not faceless ; he had many names , but he was not nameless . History would know him by the face , intense , relentless , desperate and determined , that he had worn on the evening of Oct. 23 in the streets of Budapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen for himself during his dauntless contest with Soviet tanks : the Hungarian Freedom Fighter . <P> The Special Quality . Hungarians are not very good plotters . The art of conspiracy-so well understood , practiced and detected by the Russians-would have been self-defeating in their struggle . What the Hungarians , a people of a special heritage and a unique language , did have was an overpowering common impulse , spirit or emotion , which suddenly united all classes against their enemy without the necessity of planning or leadership . The emotion had its origin in shared sufferings under the Russian police state , but it was made strong and enduring because it was tempered by that impracticable and , in Marxist terms , most despised of qualities , romanticism .
