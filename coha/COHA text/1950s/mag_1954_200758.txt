Bryant Bowles , head of the race-baiting National Association for the Advancement of White People , was riding high last week , and neither rain , nor police , nor dark of night appeared to keep him from his self-appointed rounds . When he flew into Delaware from Washington , D.C. , he was promptly arrested by order of Governor J. Caleb Boggs for conspiring to violate the state 's school-attendance laws . But within four hours he was out on bail again , free to stir up trouble . <P> At the airport , some 5,000 people were on hand to greet him-and just about the same 5.000 were still there when he returned from the police . " Some people , " cried Bowles triumphantly , " have had the honor of being arrested by privates , some by corporals , some even by captains . But I 've had the honor of being arrested by the governor . " As the crowd cheered and horns honked , Bowles launched into his harangue . He referred sneeringly to " departed " U.S. Supreme Court Justice Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young , who is trying to revoke the N.A.A.W.P. 's charter . Young 's real name , announced Bowles dramatically , is actually Hyman Yanowitz . <P> Next night at Lincoln , he played the same tune again . But he charged that since " Attorney General Hyman Albert Yanowitz. alias H. Albert Young , " had never changed his name legally , he should be forced to resign . Finally , Bowles declared that he would welcome the support of Negroes who " sincerely " believed in segregation . But Negroes would attend N.A.A.W.P. meetings only on a segregated basis : " The only thing we 'll do together is to pledge allegiance to the flag . " <P> <P> Though Attorney General Young refused to comment on Bowles 's attack ( his Jewish background was known in his 1950 campaign ) , he proved that he was no man to back down from a fight . When the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People brought suit in behalf of ten Negro students who were barred from the white Milford , Del. high school ( TIME , Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N.A.A.C.P. " Here , " said he . " are ten children who were attending school without incident . Why were they taken out ? " Young 's answer : " Mob rule . " <P> After hearing the arguments of Young and the N.A.A.C.P. , Delaware 's Vice Chancellor William Marvel ruled that the ten Negroes " have a clear and legal right " to attend the Milford school . But that decision was obviously not the end of the affair . At week 's end , Milford 's white citizens were beginning to mutter again , and Bryant Bowles was still around to keep them aroused . " When the Negroes walk in , " said he . " the whites will walk out . " <P> Though so far the noisiest of the lot , the N.A.A.W.P. is not the only group fighting desegregation . Others and their creeds : The National Association for the Advancement and Protection of the Majority of the White People , chartered in Georgia last June , claims it will fight " any and all legal actions brought to destroy segregation laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among its founders : Dr. Marvin Head , onetime Chief Klansman of Griffin , Ga .
