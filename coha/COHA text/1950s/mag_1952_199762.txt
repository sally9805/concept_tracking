As the oldest , richest paper in Washington , the Evening Star ( circ. 226,000 ) is the capital 's only real home-town daily . While other Washington dailies vie for national prestige and influence , the Star acts as Washington 's devoted housewife , fighting as hard for good garbage disposal in the District as for good government in the nation . Like any efficient housekeeper , the Star seldom wastes anything , every day prints almost all the 200,000 words that file into its city room over the A.P . wire . Although its coverage of the government , Capitol Hill and the world is more complete than any paper in the city , its neat , restrained columns ( where liquor ads are banned ) are jammed with reports on civic meetings , mothers ' clubs , high-school graduations and local bird life . Says Editor Benjamin M. McKelway : The last time the paper was " really wrought up " was when it fought the " free silver of the Bryan campaign . " <P> Last week , at a banquet at Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady celebrated her looth birthday . With a propriety befitting her age and standing , the paper 's staff sat around her table in strict order of service seniority . Next to President <P> Samuel Kauffmann , 54 , was the head janitor on the sixth floor , who came to the paper when Kauffmann did , 31 years ago . Alongside Editor McKelway , 57 , sat a Negro press helper who got a job on the Star in 1920 , when McKelway came to work for the paper . For the occasion , the Old Lady showed she could still kick up her skirts . To the " Live a little " tune , the Star promotion manager good-naturedly needled the staff : " You 've got to lie a little , boast a little/You 've gotto make like the Washington Post a little . . . " <P> <P> From Stub to Monument . Ever since the Star was started in 1852 , it has kept its eye on Washington . The paper , said its first editorial , " will preserve a strict neutrality , and whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an especial manner to the local interests of the beautiful city which bears the honored name of Washington . " Since the Washington Monument was just a stub then , it set out to raise money to complete it . The Star campaigned for street numbers on houses , modern jails , a closed sewage system and through railroads , and even bested the Pennsylvania Railroad in a fight to eliminate grade crossings . Once , in a burst of effervescence , after the Star fought to rout a " swindling " local government , the paper chanted in banner headlines : VICTORY ! VICTORY ! ! VICTORY ! ! ! <P> <P> EMERY ELECTED BY 3800 MAJORITY <P> CARRIES EVERY WARD IN CITY ! - BY- BYE COOK ! ! <P> - FAREWELL BOWEN - A LONG ETERNAL <P> ADIEU TO THE WHOLE SWINDLING RING - <P> HAIL KERLUMBY ! ! - YAH ! YAH ! ! YAH ! ! ! <P> <P> The Star is not only edited for the whole family , but has been published by the same families for 85 years . Fifteen years after its birth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noyes , together with New York World Washington Correspondent George W. Adams , Ohio Publisher Samuel Kauffmann , and two others who were soon bought out . The Noyes-Adams-Kauffmann families still own the paper . By inheritance , the Star 's stock has already passed to the fourth and fifth generations .
