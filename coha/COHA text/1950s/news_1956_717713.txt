txt The Senate Privileges and Elections Subcommittee was confronted with a new hurdle today in its projected wide investigation of ? possible corrupt practices to influence Congress . William F. Knowland of California , the Senate Republican leader , said in an interview that " there will be a full investigation . " He expressed doubt , however , that the three-man unit was the . prope ? instrument . He thus made it uncertain whether the subcommittee could get the necessary cooperation of other Senators , including ! leaders of both parties . The response of the subcom- ' rnittee 's chairman , Senator Al- ' bert Gore , Democrat of Tennessee , was to announce a meeting ' for Monday to advance arrangements for an aggressive inquiry . The subcommittee agreed unanimously earlier this week on an investigation to uncover any improper attempts by " selfish interests " to influence members of Congress through campaign contributions or other expenditures . Would Follow George Group The project grew out of a disclosure by Senator Francis Case . The South Dakota Republican said that a Nebraska lawyer interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute $2,500 to his campaign fund . The subcommittee resolved to take up where a special committee , headed by Senator Walter , F. George , Democrat of Georgia , left off in an investigation limited to the Case incident . The George committee has traced the money to the " personal funds " of Howard B. Keck , ' a California oil and gas producer . It plans to report next week on whether the contribu-1 tion represented an improper attempt to influence Senator Case 's vote . A Federal grand jury , conducting a secret investigation here , also may report next week . ' The jury has examined witnesses heard a week ago by the George committee . The bill to exempt producers of natural gas from direct Federal regulation was vetoed by . President Eisenhower yesterday because of what he called the " arrogant " activities of some private interests . Until Mr. Knowland spoke out ' today , it had been assumed gen- ! erally that leaders would not ' obstruct the Gore subcommit-1 tee 's investigation . There were indications , however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts , has announced that a Government Operations subcommittee of which he is chairman is planning " a full investigation of all phases and types of lobbying activities and pressures . " Jurisdiction is reported to be uppermost in the minds of Senate Democratic leaders . One proposal tentatively under Democratic consideration is to create a special bipartisan committee of members from all committees having a claim to jurisdiction , with Senator Gore as chairman . It was observed that Senators might hesitate to cooperate in such an investigation without having some voice in 6 determininer its scope and the composition 3f the panel . Speaker Sam Rayburn , meanwhile , removed any possibility of a further move this session to relax Federal regulation ' of i , the natural gas industry . President Eisenhower had suggested in his veto message that this might be desirable on the completion of investigations of the Case incident . " We have already passed a bill , and he vetoed it , and that 's the end of it , " Mr. Rayburn asserted .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
