txt The end of non-subsidized housing construction by New York City and the tightening of Federal limitations on subsidized public housing are making it increasingly difficult to find familysized apartments that rent for less than $100 a month in- new buildings , particularly in Manhattan . A survey showed yesterday that the exodus of middle-income families was continuing from the older residential sections to the city 's outskirts , farther into Long Island , upstate and northern New Jersey . The new suburbanites , including young married couples and families which had doubled up in apartments during World War II and the acute post-war housing shortage , are buying small homes . Even with double fare by subway and bus or commutation travel costing $10 to $40 a month , they find this less costly than an apartment near their work in the city . Among the low-income families , more than 350,000 of whom have filed applications to go into subsidized public projects that house 63,000 families , many continue to live in old tenements that are in violation of building laws , share inadequate quarters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay out a disproportionate share of their wages to landlords . Several hundred thousand New Yorkers live in buildings that do not meet minimum legal requirements for safety and sanitation , according to the city 's Department of Housing and Buildings . Commissioner Bernard J. Gillroy said these tenement dwellers had no other place to go . The department , which had deferred enforcement in many such cases , is now haling the owners to court and obtaining convictions . The owners pay fines , protest that rehabilitation of the old dwellings would be prohibitively costly , and the situation remains unchanged in most cases . Housing construction in the // metropolitan area has declined in the past year . Neither apartments nor suburban small homes are being built in anywhere near the record numbers of 1950 . Construction activity is.still brisk , but has not yet caught up with the dwelling shortage except for certain types of housing not Within reach of those whose housing need is greatest . Public officials and private builders agree that there is a shortage of housing for middle and low-income families . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how serious the shortage is . Private operators declare bluntly they ca n't build apartments in the city and make a profit on rentals at $20 a room . Analysts in the State Division of Helloing estimate that there are in New York City 95,000 more families than there are family dwelling units . State Housing Commissioner Herman T. Stichman notes that this is not a full measure of the local housing need because it does not include 10,000 families of war veterans now living in Quonset huts and other emergency temporary housing , which must be abandoned within a year , or families living in rookeries slated for slum clearance . This situation , an improvement since the 1946-47 housing crisis when this city had 150,000 more families than dwelling units , is still a major problem , according to Commissioner Sticlunan . For the metropolitan area , including the city and those suburbs within this state , the excess of families over family dwelling units is only 75,000 , according to the same analysts . This would indicate that there is an excess of 20,000 dwelling units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to draw that many families out of the city . Moses Sees Remedies This pull out of the city for middle-income families is somewhat stronger than that if the widespread home-building in northern New Jersey is taken into consideration . The most optimistic view of the helloing situation taken by any public official is that of Robert Moses , City Construction Coordinator and chairman of the Committee on Slum Clearance Plans . " I would n't say the shortage is over , but it is n't an emergency any longer , " he said . Mr. Moses declared that the Federal Housing Admiinstration 's loan insurance system for private builders had made it possible " for a lot of people to move out to the suburbs . " He praised the F. H. A. as having made " the greatest single contribution towards getting additional housing built . " Further mitigation of the local housing shortage will come , according to Mr. Moses , from the ten slum clearance projects his committee has prepared . The Moses projects for urban redevelopment are the first in the nation under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up slums and sell the property at a loss to private developers who will put up new houses , with Federal funds making up two-thirds of the deficit and city funds the remainder . Mr. Moses hopes the first four of these projects will be under way in a few months , the first of them lying between West Fifty-eighth and Sixtieth Streets and Columbus Circle and Columbus Avenue . A more serious view of the housing shortage was taken by Herman T. Stichman , State Commissioner of Housing . Doubt of Alleviation " There is still a very serious shortage of rental housing for those in the middle and lowermiddle income groups , " said Mr. Stichman " The Title I redevelopment program will contribute little toward alleviating the housing shortage . It can not provide a great many more apartments because , being a slum clearance program , it will displace families who now occupy the sites . " Emphasizing the need for more low and middle-income housing in the city , Commissioner Stichman said : " Every day , and dozens of times daily , we get calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just ca n't be found . People have to escape to the suburbs and outlying sections to find rental housing anywhere near their means . " Although city and Federal funds will pay capital subsidies to meet the land cost difference for the urban redevelopment ( Title I ) projects , there will be no continuing subsidies for operating costs , and neither the city nor the Federal Government may put a limit on the rents the private operators will charge . These rents , it is conceded , will be well above the $16.59 a room in the city 's own nonsubsidized housing and the $9 a room in the subsidized public housing . The completion , early in July , of the last of the 2,071 Pomonok apartments in Queens will end the $232,807,000 construction program whereby the City Housing Authority has provided 22,643 nonsubsidized apartments in twenty projects at $16.59-a-room rentals . Nonsubsidy Projects Lapse These twenty projects , the first public housing in the United States without cash subsidy , have been referred to at times as " middleincome " public housing , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a $1,900 income limitation for tenants and the average income of families in this type of housing is $4,000 a year . City housing officials say that , with living costs and taxes as high as they are , $4,000 is hardly , middle income . The nonsubsidized housing has been constructed since 1918 without any Federal or state funds . There are no each subsidies for operational deficits , as in other public housing , because there are no deficits . The rents are far below those of comparable commercial housing because the city grants partial tax exemption , takes no profit and has been able to borrow money for the construction at low interest-from less than 2 per cent to 3.21 per cent . There will be no more of this $16.59-a-room public housing , at least until the need for more subsidized housing at $9 to $11 a room has been better met , according to Philip J. Cruise , Housing Authority chairman . The need for subsidized low-cost housing will not be satisfied for many years . The City Housing Authority has in its current file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot check indicated about 36 per cent duplication , caused by families making application for several projects in hope of getting into any one of them . This leaves more than 339,000 separate families on the waiting hook . In only 8,909 of these cases has investigation been completed and the family put on an approved list for the next vacancies . Constriction of Federal Aid The program for more low-cost housing has already been slowed by Congress and is threatened with near destruction . A Congressional limitation of 50,000 subsidized housing units for the entire nation in any fiscal year has forced the City Housing Authority to postpone until after July 1 the advertising of bids for construction on two projects in Manhattan , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens . Two of these , Breukelen Houses in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and the first section of St. Nicholas Houses in Harlem , are partly opened for occupancy . A bill that would slash the national limit from 50,000 subsidized units a year to 5,000 has passed the House and is now in Senate committee . Supporters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing will be wrecked if the measure goes through unchanged . The City Housing Authority , created in 1934 , has completed to date forty-seven permanent housing projects , with 53,000 units , at a cost of some $500,000,000 . Another thirty-nine projects , with 48,800 apartments , are under constrUction or approved . Authorization of nearly $1,000,000,000 has been made for these projects and others for which sites have not yet been determined . The Federal Government 's contribution last year to meeting the operating deficits of these projects was $1,012,236 and state cash subsidies totaled $4,654,525 . These contributions vary slightly from year to year . Extent of Housing Provided By the time all funds already authorized have been turned into buildings-which the Housing Authority hopes will be within five to six years-a total of $1,412,000 , - 000 will have provided 128,000 apartments in this city . Except for the 21,000 apartments built under the Authority 's nonsubsidized program , all this housing rents or will rent when completed at $9 to $9.50 a room . It is limited to families with income of no more than $3,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are accepted up to $4,200 income . Where a tenant 's income subsequently increases beyond the limit for admission to a public project , he is permitted some leeway without enforced moving by payment of a rent premium . Ground was broken on April 14 at Mariners Harbor , Staten Island , for the last of the Federally aided low-rent housing developments approved for construction in the current fiscal year . The largest lowrent development on Staten Island , it will consist of a dozen threestory and ten six-story buildings with a total of 607 apartments . Largest of all the low-rent projects to be erected by the city with Federal money is the Baruch Houses for which ground was broken halt month on the lower East Side . The $31,410,000 project will provide apartments for 2,194 families ( an estimated 9,500 persons ) in seventeen buildings , which will cover only 11.8 per cent of the acquired 27.9 acres on which are now some of the city 's most miserable tenements . The rest of the site will-be used for landscaping , walks , sitting areas and playgrounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tenants by the summer of next year , but it is not certain that the last of the rookeries will have been cleared off the site by then . Problems of Relocation Relocation of families living on sites acquired for public housing , is one of the big headaches of the City Housing Authority and threatens to become an even bigger headache for Commissioner Moses when his slum clearance under the urban redevelopment program gets going . , Many slum families , for one reason or another , are not eligible for public housing apartments and there are nowhere near enough available apartments in the completed projects Per all of them , anyway . Some families and little tradesmen , rooted in a neighborhood for most of their lives , refuse to start out anew in a distant part of the city . Of the 3,035 families living on the site when title was acquired in February , 1951 , for Baruch Houses , only 871 had been relocated fourteen months later . A somewhat better record for relocation has been made on the site of Van Dyke Houses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what will eventually be 1,451 apartments . When the city took title on Feb. 1 , 1951 , 1,822 families and 260 commercial tenants were on the site . This has been whittled down to 632 families and fifty-four commercial tenants , and it is hoped that the whole site will be cleared by early next year . Because of the slow and difficult relocation task , the City Housing Authority follows a pat , tern of razing only a corner of the existing housing on a site , relocating those tenants as best it cansometimes only temporarily-and building the new housing in sec-. tions into which some of the tenents from the remaining old ( dwellings are moved to make possible the destruction of those structures . As an aid to the relocation process , the City Housing Authority operates sixty rehabilitated old houses , with a total of 873 apartments , in East Harlem , the lower East Side and the Bronx . The three and four-room apartments rent for $10 to $11 a room , a figure that matches rents in comparable tenements rehabilitated in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? made by the City Housing . Authority from the completion in 1936 of its first project , named First Houses , at East Third Street and Avenue A. Public housing has grown big from that project of 123 apartments to giant developments like Baruch Houses or the even larger Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City , Queens , . with 3,149 ' apartments , Red Hook Houses in ' Brooklyn with 2,545 apartments , the Governor Smith Houses in Manhattan , where 1,935 families live just north of the Brooklyn Bridge , and the biggest yet-Fort Greene Houses with 3,501 apart-1 ments in downtown Brooklyn . The Fort Greene and Governor Smith Houses are among thirty projects which have been built or1 are to be built for the City Housing Authority with funds provided by the state . Of these thirteen are completed , three partially occupied , two in construction , and twelve in various stages of planning . Of thirty-two other projects , for which the Federal Government provides construction funds , eleven are completed , two partially occupied , seven in construction , and twelve in plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houses , were built entirely with city funds . In addition to the Federal and State subsidized low-cost housing , the city 's tax-exempt nonsubsi ' dized housing and the new Title I program of Federal . and city land ' acquisition subsidies to help private redevelopment of slum areas , such measures have been taken to scale down prohibitive costs of new housing as the state 's limiteddividend program for straight rental and cooperative apartment ( building and the Federal insurance of home loans up to 90 per cent of the value . There has been abuse and attempted abuse of the state and Federal aid to private builders in some instances by speculators , some of whom puffed up their figures to go into ventures without putting up a dollar of their own money . The over-all effect , however , has been a tremendous aid in supplying thousands of dwelling units at rentals which , although above the incomes of lower-salaried New Yorkers , are far below those of unaided private construction . Forms of Subsidy Employed The Federal , State and City , Governments have been giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies through tax exemptions to other public projects and have at the same time been giving subsidies in one form or another to private builders and rental operators . The state 's limited dividend program has already provided 8,645 apartments built with private capital in fourteen completed projects , with 2,048 apartments in two projects under construction , and two smaller developments with 660 units in the planning stage . The price range in these apartments is $12 to $15.15 a room for straight rentals , with monthly payments slightly less in the case of cooperatives , which require a down payment of $215 to $650 a room . In return for agreeing to a 6 per cent limit on their profit and some state control to prevent wasteful operation or milking of the property the private builders get partial tax exemption and certain other advantages . The limited dividend housing includes such large privately financed projects as the 1,585-family Knickerbocker Village in Manhattan and the 1,412-family Hillside Houses in Queens and as small as the forty-four-apartment Stanton Homes on the lower East Side . Members of some of the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the state limited dividend program . The Amalgamated Clothing Workers , for instance , have built fourteen sections in the Bronx and one in Manhattan at different times in the last twentyfive years for a total of 1,094 homes . The employers , nand employes ' Joint Board of the Electrical Industry is building 1,980 apartments on the old Pomonok Country Club grounds in Queens . This will be known as Electchester to disinguish it from the city 's nonsubsidized Pomonok houses on an adjoining site . Limited Dividend Plan Fading The future for limited dividend construction under state control does not seem bright . Investment capital is finding opportunities for greater profit and easier - regulations under the Federal loan insurance program . One large developer , who had filed last year for limited dividend construction in Queens , withdrew his application the day before the City Council was to vote on his tax exemption request and is now putting up his project under a Federal loan insurance . The rents will be several pegs above what they could have been under limited dividend regulations . Since authorization was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not yet begun , there have been no new applications made to the state for limited dividend housing . In the face of this apparent lack of interest by private capital in the state program and the increasing pressures in Congress against large-scale public housing , the building of apartments as private projects for investment or speculation is a matter of increasing importance to middle-class families in need of new housing . As things stand now , most of the private construction of apartments that is going on is out of rental reach of middle income and lower middle income families .
