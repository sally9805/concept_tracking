txt Monsieur Felix Gaillard , the young Finance Minister of the last French government who tried to make Frenchmen tighten their belts and pay their taxes , has agreed to try to form a new government to renlace the care-taker government which has been governing more or less since the last government fell . M. Gaillard will be 38 years old tomorrow , the very day he goes before the National Assembly to try to form his government .

And every French politician if not every Frenchman must at least try to become Premier and usually does . The only thought we have to offer as a bit of encouragement to young M. Gaillard on his birthday is this : If he is named Premier at 38 , he can be pretty sure he wo n't be troubled with the job at 39.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
