Long-faced Manager " Red " Rolfe of the Detroit Tigers knew what was wrong with his ball club . " We lack speed , " , he pointed out , " and we 're not a long-ball-hitting club . We need five or six hits to make two or three runs . " His best pitcher had a sore arm and had not been able to play in a regular game this season . Yet , at week 's end , Robert Abial Rolfe 's team was somehow leading the American League . <P> Detroit 's good start was no great shock to the baseball pundits . Last year the Tigers finished fourth , ten games off the pace , but over the winter they strengthened themselves , on paper , by paying $125,000 and a pitcher to the St. Louis Browns for Second Baseman Gerry Priddy , and by trading lackadaisical Outfielder Wakefield* to the New York Yankees for promising First Baseman Dick Kryhoski . <P> With Third Baseman George Kell , a place-hitter who last year managed to shade Boston 's Ted Williams by .0002 percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipon , Detroit hoped to have a major-league infield for the first time since it won the pennant in 1945 . Red Rolfe 's outfield promised to be even stronger , particularly if 1949 rookie sensation Johnny Groth could keep his .367 hitting pace . Detroit fans were already looking forward happily to a World Series in Briggs Stadium . <P> Manager Rolfe knew it might not be as simple as all that . Studious Red Rolfe keeps a typewritten card file on his players ' performances , but it took no card file to tell him that First Baseman Kryhoski ( " We 'll need 15 or 20 homers out of him to win the pennant " ) was hitting a discouraging .196 last week . Moreover , he had not been able to use 28-year-old Pitcher Hal Newhouser at all , did not know when he could start him . " It 's nice to know people are thinking of us in terms of a pennant , " said Rolfe in a mild understatement . " We have a chance , but Boston and New York are loaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . When the Yankees sold him to the second-division Chicago White Sox , Wakefield refused to join the Sox unless they boosted his $17,000 pay by $5,500 . Said the White Sox management : no deal . Since the Yankees did not want to take him back , that seemed to leave Wakefield , potentially a brilliant outfielder , the No. 1 D.P. of baseball . The problem presented to Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler ( and still unresolved ) : did the New York Yankees , or the Chicago White Sox , owe Wakefield the current year 's salary ?
