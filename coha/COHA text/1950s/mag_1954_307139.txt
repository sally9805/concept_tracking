The U.S. searches for a world economic policy <P> THE U.S. is preparing to open a new front in the cold war-an economic front . On presidential instructions , former Budget Director Joseph M. Dodge hastened back to Washington from his Detroit bank to undertake a sweeping review of " the entire field of cold war economic strategy . " Secretary of State Dulles is pressing for a huge expansion of U.S. investments abroad ; Foreign Operations Director Harold Stassen. whose department is slated to go out of business next summer , has proposed an ambitious scheme which is already being called " A Marshall Plan for Asia . " <P> The air is full of plans , but they have yet to undergo a purification by budget . Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey , a hard man with a dollar and a weighty man in the Cabinet , is against any large-scale foreign spending ; Banker Dodge thinks Harold Stassen 's plans are dangerously dreamy . The foreign-aid enthusiasts think Humphrey and Dodge are dangerously unimaginative . But despite individual differences , the Cabinet is unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is changing , and that the U.S. urgently needs to reshape its foreign policy . The objective is to shift the emphasis of U.S. world strategy away from military containment ( which leaves the initiative with the Communists ) , closer to economic " liberation , " with the emphasis on advance . <P> Pax Atomica . Currently , U.S. policy suffers from what one State Department man calls " a heavy military bias . " Too many U.S. officials have fallen into the habit of measuring progress ( or security ) exclusively by the number of nuclear explosions , the number of divisions mobilized . The result is that the U.S. is stuck with a warlike vocabulary ( e.g. , " massive retaliation " ) , while the Communists , who continue to aggress , have stolen the words of peace ( e.g. , " coexistence " ) . <P> President Eisenhower is convinced that " there is no longer any alternative to peace . " The British believe that the world is entering a period of pax atomica , based on a recognition by both sides of a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington is " competitive coexistence . " <P> In the next ten years , warned the State Department last week , the main cold-war battleground may well be economic . " The leaders of the Soviet Union , " said one of its experts , " are apparently proceeding on the theory that economics is the Achilles heel of the West . " To meet this challenge , which in a period of cold peace might prove more dangerous than all the fleets and armies of Moscow and Peking , the U.S. needs to prove that democracy and capitalism have more to offer-in terms of freedom , justice and plenty-than the Communists ever can . What is needed is no less than a new World Economic Policy .
