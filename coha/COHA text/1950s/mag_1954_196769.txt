Headlined Rome 's L'Unit last week : <P> TOMORROW CITY BUS AND TRAM LINES WILL BE STRUCK FROM 9 TO 11 AND FROM 3 TO 5 . The strike , led by a Communist-controlled union , occurred as predicted , to no one 's surprise . For , as the biggest ( est. circ. 500,000 ) and most powerful Communist newspaper published in the free world , L'Unit not only reports the news but makes it as well . <P> Italian Communists read L'Unit for more than news . They read it to find which way the party expects them to jump . Last week L'Unit itself was jumping for joy . After winding up its 30th anniversary celebration , including circulation-building , mass meetings addressed by party brass and " medals of honor " for widows and children of devoted L'Unit workers , the paper got another circulation boost from the Wilma Montesi scandal ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Beamed one of L'Unit 's top executives : " L'Unit is absolutely the biggest Communist newspaper outside the People 's Democracies . " <P> L'Unit is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact newspaper circulation figures are a closely guarded secret , it is one of the biggest journalistic operations . Its central Rome edition is connected by its own wire to offices in Milan , Turin and Genoa , where separate editions are put out . Its staff of eight editors , 115 reporters and rewritemen and eight foreign correspondents is supplemented by 2,875 party members , who act as part-time volunteer correspondents , in almost every town in Italy . L'Unit prints 27 subeditions with local news for every region where it is sold . Thus , unlike other Communist papers in the West ( e.g. , Manhattan 's amateurish Daily Worker , San Francisco 's People 's World ) , L'Unit works hard to cover the news . <P> Party Line-Up . As a result of its coverage , L'Unit attracts non-Communists along with Communist readers . Many a non-Communist buys the paper simply for its news and its full coverage of scandals , crime , sports and entertainment , and swallows a thick coating of propaganda with the news . For example , L'Unit 's elaborate coverage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the party 's battle against the government . " I do n't like L'Unit 's politics , " said one monarchist reader , " but it is readable and clear and tells you things other papers do n't . " <P> L'Unit makes no secret of its Communist ties . Periodically , on Page One , it prints such instructions to party members as : " All Communist Senators without exception are required to be present at tomorrow 's session . " When the party line is not clear , L'Unit has a simple way of finding out what it is . The editors call on Italy 's Communist Party Boss Palmiro Togliatti , once editor of the paper and still its ultimate authority as well as its biggest shareholder . When Togliatti himself has not yet had the word from Moscow L'Unit is forced to wait , as it did when the " doctors ' plot " exploded in Moscow and L'Unit came out with the story a day after the other Italian papers .               @ @ @ @ @ @
