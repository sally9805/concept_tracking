Speaking at a luncheon .. in the University ' Club , 1 West Fiftyfourth Street , the Mayor declared that the Federal government should meet 80 per cent , the state 15 per cent and the city 5 per cent of the cost of the program . " The entire country bears the responsibility for the fact that New York is a target city , " he said . " The entire country therefore should assist us in our defense . " The Mayor emphasized that the percentages to be assumed by the Federal , state and city governments were the only ones that would permit New York to prepare its defense without crippling itself financially . " I call on Congress now to appropriate this money , " he said . " I call on the Federal and state legislatures to concur In this 80-15-5 per cent plan , which offers our best chance of survival . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide manpower for our defense . In this battle , we are all in the front-line trenches . There are no rear areas , no home-front civilians . " $250,000,000 for Construction Mr. Impellitteri said that $250 , - 000,000 was the minimum needed for long-range construction , including the building of shelters , additional highways , bridges , hos ' pital space , fire and police buildings . He . said that $91,000,000 was required for immediate needs , and for food , clothing and emergency items . " Who is to provide money or that equipment ' ? " he asked . " Obviously the city can bear only a small portion . of this crushing burden . This is a national emergency and plans must be made on a national scale . " Stressing that the funds were needed immediately the Mayor said : " We can not wait . Our Office of Civil Defense has operated so far on a scant $2,250,000 , or about // thirty-five cents allotted to save the life of each New Yorker . Almost all of that money is already earmarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would warn us in case of attack , for cots and stretchers and for the communications linking our report centers with fire , police , medical and public works emergency services . " City Called No. 1 Objective The Mayor quoted civil-defense experts as saying they believed New York would be the first city to be attacked in the event of enemy action against the United States . " All agree that New York would be the number one objective of an enemy attack , " he said . He described the civil defense plans for helping victims in the event of an emergency . He said he was disappointed because New Yorkers had not responded in sufficient numbers to the appeals for volunteers . " We have not received the right kind of cooperation , " he said . " The volunteers have not come forward in large enough numbers . The public should be told more and more about the needs of the city for civilian-defense manpower . " Mayor Impellitteri departed from the prepared text of his speech to say that the city could , get along without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from the state . He charged also that the city 's financial situation was being greatly distorted in private and public discussions . " Some people will tell you , " he said , " that the way to cut down on expenses is to fail to fill vacancies that occur from time to time . " He said the Citizens Budget Committee urged that such vacancies remain unfilled for an eighteenmonth period . The Mayor said he opposed such a proposal . He declared its adoption would force the school system to get along with 5,000 fewer teachers before the end of the eighteen months . It would also result , he said , in a decrease of from 3,000 to 4,000 members of the Police Department , 2,000 to 3,000 in the Fire Department and of thousands of sanitation workers .

Certain sections of this subway would be built as shelters , then linked up in more peaceful times for subway use , making the subways dual purpose but not for dual use . The plan provides for dispersed shelters and ramp entrances and for construction of floodgates and bulkheads to prevent flooding of land areas in case of tunnel breaks . Emergency sleeping accommodations would be provided for 101,500 and temporary shelter for 1,000,000 others . Kogel Calls far Volunteers Dr. Marcus D.
