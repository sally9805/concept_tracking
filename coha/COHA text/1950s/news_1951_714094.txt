Corporation GossipBy and large conservative opinion in the Street was not surprised at American Cyanamid directors ' action in declaring a regular dividend and not acting on a much talked of stock split . However , from now on . bulls on the stock will watch directors ' meetings with an eye to such a possible split of the common shares . Perhaps one of the main reasons for this hopefulness is the popularity of the stock and its growth possibilities , together with a narrowing market as shares are withdrawn from the market and put into investment portfolios .

A Stock Market AppraisalThis is what veteran traders call the silly season in the stock market . The market has had the traditional summer advance and chartists are looking for the sell-off which has taken place in most years of the past half century in late August or early September . Investors are looking for " cheap spots " in the market at which to buy and traders are watching for " high spots ' at which to sell short . By and large . the fundamentals still rule , however , say conservatives . At the moment . the international situations are gloomy . which , say the bulls , accentuates the Government 's plans to step up defense plans . By the same token , an irritated international outlook stimulates the Administration 's campaign for controls and taxes . in the Wall Street view . Back of all this is the large and growing amounts of cash waiting restively to go into stocks for the long pull . It is notable that the bulk of brokers ' mat ket letters emphasize caution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time suggest that long pull investors hold their positions . Inasmuch as the short position is growing and the amount of trading " credits " in brokerage houses is getting larger all the time . it would appear that the burden of proof for an important sell-off this fall is on the bears . Technically , the market acts well . Profit taking here and there and short selling on advances is absorbed and bears are using the international news and some poorer earnings reports to step up their arguments . But by and large , the pattern has not changed . say seasoned chartists . The downtrends have been minor and volume has favored the buying side . Funds for investment are increasing because caution in spending is increasing . Whether or not the growing backlog of cash will go into securities is problematical . In the opinion of investment brokers this is a problem for the bulls , not for the bears . Splits are going to continue , with some important ones in the offing . This is necessary because of the rapid absorption of the floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment are somewhat mixed . Some industries which have been operating at high levels are showing slight signs of easing . Others , which have been passing through fairly long - periods of doldrums . now are coming to the fore . Movies . department stores , liquOrs and a large number of special stocks , particularly in the lower priced category . are considered by technicians as behind the upward parade . It is notable that in sonic divisions where inventory positions were topheavy , improvement is reported . This is particularly true in some of the soft mei chandise lines . Taxes are beginning to make inroads into profits and probably will continue to do so as the year passes . But . Wall Street does not expect this to prevent another record dividend year . which is why long pull buyers cue investing . ? ? ? Market Views Said Edward T.

Of course , the territory served by Northern Pacific is phenomenally prosperous , and the company earned $2.29 in the first half against a loss of 66 cents a share in the first half of 1950 . On weakness , we would be more inclined to buy the stock than sell it .
