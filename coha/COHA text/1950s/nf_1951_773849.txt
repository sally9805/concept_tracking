The head of the Brahman is rather flat , with coarse horns and heavy , drooping ears . Brahmans are preferably gray or red in color with dark noses and hooves . The Brahman can be very tame and tractable , but under range condi tions it frequently becomes highly excitable . Brahman cattle yield a very high percentage of carcass when slaughtered . Even the hump pro vides edible meat . THE SANTA GERTRUDIS Origin . The Santa Gertrudis breed , first recognized in 1940 as the only beef breed originating in the United States , was founded and de voleped by Robert J. Kleberg , Jr. , of the King Ranch , Kingsville , Texas , by crossing Brahman bulls of the Nellore strain on purebred // Shorthorn cows beginning in 1920 . This breed is composed of approxi mately five-eighths Shorthorn and three-eighths Brahman blood . As yet , few purebred Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only breed register is maintained by the King Ranch , which records individuals in a control herd of about 400 cows . Another herd of over 600 purebred Santa Gertrudis cows is branded in such a way as to distinguish between families but not individuals . Progress in America . The breed owes much of its present value to a bull called Monkey , whose sons and daughters have been inbred and linebred until the breed is remarkably true to type and color . Over 95 per cent of the present offspring are a deep cherry-red in color and possess the desired beef conformation and quality . Santa Gertrudis steers are reported to weigh 150 pounds more than steers of the British breeds and to yield a very high percentage of carcass when slaughtered . They also possess much of the Brahman 's hardiness , heat resistance , and rustling ability . Present-day standards . The Santa Gertrudis shows practically no hump and but very little extra skin on the neck , brisket , and underline . // It is solid red in color , with white confined to the underline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally high carcass yield . THE LESSER BREEDS Galloway . The Galloway breed , which originated in the extreme southwestern part of Scotland , is a direct descendant from a horned race that formerly occupied the old Province of Galloway . In 1750 the greater part of the cattle of Galloway were horned , but soon after polled cattle became quite popular and numerous . The Galloway was recorded along with the Aberdeen Angus in the Polled Herd Book , founded in 1862 . In 1877 the breeders established their own record . The first recorded importation to America was made in 1853 by Graham Brothers of Ontario , Canada . The American Galloway Breed ers Association was organized in 1882 . Galloways are black , polled , and smaller in size than the Aberdeen Angus . The hair is long and curly . They are somewhat longer in body // and flatter in rib than the Angus . Scurs are a disqualification as is white above the underline . Very few Galloways are to be found in America today . Brangus , Braford , Brahorn , Charbra , and Beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation-wide interest in crossbreeding has resulted in attempts to establish new breeds from crossing the Brahman on the Angus ( Brangus ) , on the Hereford ( Braford ) , on the Shorthorn ( Brahorn ) , on the French Charollais ( Charbra ) , and on both the Hereford and Shorthorn in a three-way cross ( Beefmaster ) . None of these are as yet officially recognized as breeds , although the American Brangus Breeders Association was organized in 1949 . Their proponents claim larger weight for age and better adaptability to the poorer range conditions than are to be had with any of the three British breeds . All will no doubt prove to be well adapted to the Deep South and the Southwest , but can expect to meet with a less ready acceptance in the northern part of the country , where extreme heat , flies , ticks , drought , and sparse feed are lesser problems and where the blockier British breeds can therefore offer stronger competition . the beef producer of the United States now finds himself in a rather unusual position . While Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these same packers tell us that , should there be very many more of this grade of cattle produced , they would sell for less than steers of the " U. S. Choice " grade . This is because the average United States consumer wants lean beef , and the retailer ca n't afford to trim off excess fat to sell for grease at a few cents per pound . For years , people have been educated to discriminate against beef having yellowish fat because it is most likely to come from cattle of dairy breeding and therefore to be of inferior quality . A survey con-ducted in Illinois before the war revealed that consumers with lower incomes actually preferred beef with a yellowish fat because it looked richer to them . Later , research in Virginia showed that when the yel lowish tinge is due to the cattle having been on pasture , the meat ac tually is richer in Vitamin A. For a number of years show type has been favoring the smaller , more compact , and earlier maturing beef cattle . Now we have conclusive evi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficient gains . Breeders are now busy " passing the buck , " trying to fix the blame for the present type on college judges , meat packers , or any other group that it can be pinned on . This is not a new situation ; the hog breeders have found themselves in it several times during the last half-century whenever they chose to ignore the fine balance between economy of production and suitability of the carcass produced as judged by con sumer demand . Another unusual fact is that while our beef industry is one of our 144 // greatest , very few farmers consider themselves to be specializing in beef production . Rather , they are farmers or ranchers trying to market the products of their farm in the most profitable manner while still maintaining , and preferably building up , the fertility of their soil . In the case of the western rancher , the principal crop is roughage . This may be marketed mainly through cattle or sheep . The corn-belt farmer may grow a wide variety of crops , but principally corn , soybeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local elevator or through any one of several kinds of livestock . Many factors enter into his choice of a route to market . Often the beef producer becomes a dairyman almost overnight . His better milking cows can produce profitable milk for sale when prices are favorable . Later they may be switched back to beef production . Permanent dairymen are inclined to condemn such " in-and-outers " for spoiling their market ; but unless or until a milk production allotment plan is worked out , they will continue this practice just as farmers expand or contract other enterprises as prices become more or less favorable . The packer 's discrimination against grass cattle is based partly on fact and partly on fallacy . Certainly , grass cattle carry less finish at a given age or weight than do similar cattle fattened in dry lot . Also , grass cattle yield a lower percentage of carcass and shrink more in the cooler . But the old argument against yellow fat is fast losing ground , since this yellow color has been shown to be indicative of higher carotene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture forage produced dark lean has been conclusively refuted . With an increasingly urgent need for soil-building systems of grassland farming and with consumers clamoring for lean meat with high contents of protein , Vitamin A , calcium , and B-complex , pasture-fattened cattle should no longer be subjected to unfair discrimination on our markets . PROBLEMS IN BREEDING The dairymen with their artificial-breeding program are demonstrating the rapid progress that can be made in improving livestock when // two requirements are met ; namely , an effective and cheap measure for quality and efficiency of production plus the means of amplifying the influence of superior sires through artificial insemination . Their biggest problem now is to find proven sires of outstanding ability . Unfortu-nately , beef breeders can not meet either of these requirements . Testing for efficiency and quality of production is still costly and slow . Efficiency of gain . Pioneer work at several experiment stations re-veals that efficiency of gain in beef cattle varies as much as 30 per cent , even in closely related animals . There also appears to be little correla-tion between the accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest gaining steers are the most efficient . Such cattle are usually growthy animals with roomy middles and rather open conformation . Three-years ' results reported by the Montana Station 1 show that Hereford steers of the so-called " large " type outgained Hereford steers // of the " small " type by 10 per cent and required four per cent less grain per pound of gain . Work reported by the Colorado Station shows that Shorthorn steers of the " conventional " type required 70 days more time to reach choice finish than did those of the " compact " type . However , the larger steers gained one-third more per day . A 1950 report of three years ' work from this same station shows a 20 per cent faster gain by the conventional type as compared with the small type of Hereford , but no difference in efficiency of gain . Experiments are in progress at three stations to determine the feed-lot performance of both the large type , the standard type , and the compact type of Hereford steers . These should yield valuable data to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of the pudding is in the eating , " because qual ity of carcass can not be judged too accurately without sacrificing the animal by slaughtering . Such things as tenderness , fineness of grain , marbling , and color of fat and lean can be accurately measured only after the carcass is hanging on the rail . Dairy cows yield a product that can easily be weighed and tested for butterfat , solids , and freedom from objectional organisms . Beef cattle do not lend themselves too well to an artificial-breeding program . While the dairy cow is up for milking and observation two or three times a day , the beef cow is usually pastured on the back part of the farm , where she is observed once a day at best and usually only once every two or three days . Also , beef cows exhibit much less obvious signs of " heat . " If in heat , the cow usually is reluctant to leave the rest of the herd to be driven to a place where she can be restrained while being inseminated . Restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef cows than with dairy cows . Then , too , the extra labor of observing closely and restraining is considered by most to be pro hibitive , especially since practically no proven beef sires are available to be used artificially . With such obstacles to overcome , the beef man can be excused for lagging behind the dairyman in improving the efficiency of production in his cattle . Such progress as he has made merits unusual praise . In the // period 1920 to 1950 the beef producer of the United States has in-creased the output of beef per cow by 15 per cent . Part of this has been brought about by increasing the percentage of calf crop from 74 to 84 per cent . The rest is the result of speeding up the growing and fattening process through both better breeding and better feeding . One has only to look at photographs of international champion steers and beef car casses to find further evidence of improvement . The long-legged , nar row-bodied , coarse-boned steer with heavy front end and light rear quarters has been replaced with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high proportion of high-priced meat and a lot of qual ity to go with it . But future progress must consider efficiency of gain , and improve ment of this characteristic has been shown to be difficult . Work at the // Texas Station indicates that weanling bulls may be fed out in dry lot to a light market weight and their efficiency of gain determined . Bulls doing well in the feed lot tend to pass this trait on to their offspring . Certainly , from a scientific standpoint it is sounder to test the prospec tive sire himself , rather than his half sisters or half brothers . The cost of fattening young bulls is not prohibitive . Then , too , bulls of this age can be fattened without permanent damage to their reproductive ability since they are still young enough to " grow away from their fat . " This plan will require the individual feeding of large numbers of animals on standardized rations and under controlled conditions . It promises to be the next tool to be used by the beef cattle breeder in improving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed re-mains to be seen . Perhaps state cattle improvement associations will be formed to do this work just as the state seed improvement associations are now operating . When selected strains and sires have been devel oped that are outstanding for type , efficiency of gain , and quality of carcass , then will artificial breeding be employed to amplify the influ ence of such animals on the breed . Forage utilization . Another interesting and important problem of the beef cattle breeder is to determine whether strains of cattle can be developed that will utilize pasture forage and harvested roughages more effectively than the average . There is reason to believe that this can be accomplished . It will require the use of a method for accurately determining the forage consumption of a grazing animal , since other-wise the efficiency of gain of a grazing animal could not be determined . Fortunately such a method is available and initial tests are being made with it . With adequate study and planning , strains of beef cattle can be produced that will fatten to a " U. S. Choice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half of age and at a weight of around 1000 pounds . Milk production . The largest single factor influencing weaning weight and finish of beef calves is the milk production of their dams . This in turn is inherited from the dam 's parents , just as it is in dairy // cattle . Shorthorns have a heritage of adequate milk production but , even so , a few Shorthorn cows would do a better job of raising their calves if they were able to produce a bit more milk . The Hereford breed is recognized as the poorest milking of the three major beef breeds . This has been due in part to their widespread use on the range where excess early milk production is almost worse than not enough . On the other hand , Hereford cows have been observed that produced up to four gallons of milk per day when fresh . Breeders in the farm states want and need more milk in their beef cows . Many are already making a conscious effort to improve this char acteristic in their herds . The more progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are keeping herd records that include the milk // production of the cow as indicated by the weight and finish of the calf at weaning . The solution to this problem seems to lie with the individual herd owner . Poor milkers should be weeded out . Certainly , no bull should be selected to head a herd of purebreds unless he is out of a cow of average or better milk production . Heifers could well be selected on the same basis , even though some claim that there is a tendency for the better milking cows to be of less acceptable beef conformation . There is ample evidence , however , to show that beef cows can be bred to produce an adequate flow of milk for their calves and still possess top beef conformation . In commercial cow and calf herds that furnish fat market calves directly off of the cow , good milk flow is a first essential . Usually crossbred beef-dairy cows will wean a thicker , lower-set , blockier , heavier , and fatter calf than a beef cow of ideal conformation but poorer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable in cattle to be raised in the Deep South . There is ample evidence to show that cattle vary considerably in this respect , depending on coat color , condition , breed , and perhaps diet . The Brahman is being used extensively in crossing with the British breeds to increase heat tolerance . Such crosses have produced the Santa Gertrudis and Brahorn ( Brahman-Shorthorn ) , the Braford ( Brahman-Hereford ) , the Brangus ( Brahman-Angus ) , and the Beefmaster ( **26;687;TOOLONG ) . Just how useful these cattle will prove to be as new breeds remains to be seen . A hundred years of experience has shown that , with very satisfactory results , heat tolerance can be built into commercial herds by such crossing . The Brahman apparently has other characteristics of interest to the beef producer , such as high dressing percentage , hardiness , rustling ability , and durability . Whether the best way to obtain these advantages is through the old approach of introducing Brahman blood at intervals , or by establishing separate breeds containing varying amounts of Brahman blood remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any crossbred animal or plant . The spectacular success of hybrid corn is leading the pubBEEF // lic to expect similar results from any cross . There is a distinct difference in these projects that will undoubtedly show up in the results . A basic step in all hybrid corn breeding is drastic and continued in-breeding of the parent stocks . This exposes weaknesses so that they may be weeded out of the breeding stock , and it also brings about a homo geneity or uniformity of germ plasm that is essential to hybrid vigor . These inbred lines are crossed in many combinations until the best re sults are obtained . Unfortunately , cattle are more costly and cumbersome to work with . The necessary degree of inbreeding , with the inevitable abandonment of many undesirable animals and even whole families , would involve many years of time and more money than any one experiment station could assign to it . However , the U. S. Department of Agriculture is at present developing inbred lines of beef cattle and hogs . The mere crossing of two breeds may produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly nothing comparable to that of // hybrid corn . The more probable result will be a blending of the char acteristics of the two parents plus a chance for reassortment of factors which , if wisely controlled , could result in more desirable new breeds for certain situations . It is doubtful that any of the newer breeds will make any great inroad on the popularity of the three major beef breeds unless it may be in the South and Southwest , where a premium is placed on the heat tolerance and hardiness that the Brahman supplies . A recent report of a crossbreeding experiment in Montana shows no improvement in efficiency of gain over purebred Herefords , but a definite improvement in rate of gain . How much , if any , of the latter was due to hybrid vigor is open to argument , since the first cross intro duced Shorthorn blood and Shorthorns have long surpassed Herefords in rate of gain and in milk production for their calves . More likely the increase in gains was a mere blending of typical Hereford and Short-horn rates of gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For range producers of feeder cattle , crossbreeding has a distinct disad vantage that should be mentioned . Order buyers of feeder cattle tend to purchase steers of uniform breeding , type , size , color , and quality . Thus , crossbred cattle with mixed colors are often discriminated against with a resulting lower price per hundredweight . The feeder buyer may be justi fied in his antipathy to off colors , because of the fact that inferior bred ani mals of poor fattening qualities may appear similar to the better bred cross breds , especially at the younger ages . Yet the finishing qualities of the two are sure to be different . It would seem , therefore , that unless the range pro ducer is either selling direct to the feeder or producing grass-fat steers , the advantages of crossbreeding are largely lost on the feeder market . ' PROBLEMS IN FEEDING The proper nutrition of beef animals has received much attention from both producers and research workers . For that reason many of the present problems have been worked out leaving the beef producer with the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // results that have been established either by research or by practical observations . Then , too , the present trend toward the greater use of pasture forage and harvested roughages is reducing the emphasis on grain feeding , thereby lending both simplicity and stability to beef production . Several of the newer developments in beef cattle feeding are of interest . More and better pastures . Good pastures are the direct by-product of our soil-building systems of farming . Nothing can surpass a good pasture turf in controlling soil erosion . A good pasture turf , with its balance of legumes and grasses , depletes the soil principally in calcium , phosphorus , and potash ? and these only at a relatively slow rate , since about six-sevenths of these elements are returned to the pasture in the manure of the grazing animals . A good pasture turf will actually build up the organic matter of its soil resulting in higher productivity and greater water-holding capacity . So , soil building and good pastures go hand in hand . Since beef cattle , dairy cattle , and sheep are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of especial interest to the beef cattle producer . He should make every effort to capitalize on the trend so as to utilize this cheap but high-quality feed in giving greater profit and stability to his enterprise . From the stockman 's standpoint good pasture forage should have the following four characteristics : ( 1 ) abundance , ( 2 ) high nutritive value , ( 3 ) palatability , and ( 4 ) accessibility . The more forage of a given quality that a pasture will yield , the more beef it will produce per acre . Also , the higher the feeding value in the pasture forage , the heavier and fatter will be the cattle at the end of the grazing season . Palatability determines the amount of forage an animal will eat in a day , provided the supply is adequate . Since a two-year-old steer must eat about 25 pounds of average fresh pasture forage a day just to maintain his weight , it should be obvious that he will be more efficient when eating 100 pounds than when eating only %5 pounds . Accessibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ater , and fly protection within easy reach at all times . This permits greater intake of forage and more efficient utilization of the pasture forage that is eaten . // It has been shown very conclusively that when a healthy beef animal finds pasture forage possessing all four of the above characteristics , he will eat enough to meet his needs both for maintenance and for at least two pounds of gain a day . The immediate goal of the beef proBEEF // ducer in the farm states should be to provide the pastures , the cattle , and the management that will produce on forage alone a " U. S. Good " steer of less than two years of age and at a market weight of 1000 to 1100 pounds . The accompanying illustration proves that this can be done . Excellent pasture forage is equally essential to the cow-and-calf pro-gram that produces with milk and grass a heavy fat calf at ten months of age . Certainly such programs will help to guarantee the success of our soil-building program , and at the same time provide maximum stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better harvested roughages mean cheaper winter feed bills and better cattle for market , since high-quality roughages furnish nutrients more cheaply than do concentrates . Most beef producers would do well to look into the possibilities of grass silage . It combines low cost , reduced weather hazard , high feed value , less feeding waste , less fire hazard , better control of weeds , and maximum control of soil erosion . Cattlemen having plenty of pasture during the middle of the summer will certainly find themselves with an excess in May and June . Apparently the very best way to utilize this surplus is to set aside the early season excess acreage for the production of grass silage . This acreage should be relatively smooth , near the silo , and fertile . After the forage from this acreage is ensiled in May or early June , the land then becomes available for midsummer and fall grazing . Thus pasture supplies are evened out and a high quality roughage is preserved for winter feeding . Fertile bluegrass pasture will yield from a May cutting up to three tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much digestible protein and slightly more total digestible nutrients per ton as the best corn silage . The legumes and grasses , preferably in corn-bination , are all well suited for such use . Another relatively new development in roughages is the barn hay-drier . This provides for the blowing of either heated or unheated air through loose , chopped , or baled hay so as to remove the excess mois-ture . The hay is taken from the field in a half-dried condition . Since the leaves will not shatter from such hay , most of the original feeding // value is retained . Also , alfalfa and other slow-drying hays can be put away on the same day as cut , thereby greatly reducing the bad weather hazard . In humid areas where hay-making weather is unreliable , the barn hay-driers are proving to be commercially feasible , paying for themselves in several years ' use . The quality of the hay produced is of especial interest to those cattlemen producing purebreds or high-quality commercial cattle . The feeding value of corn cobs for beef cattle has been receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been appreciated by most farmers outside the corn belt , many cobs have been burned or otherwise wasted in the corn belt itself . The wartime shortages of concentrates led to renewed interest in the value and use ' of roughages . The findings from several state experiment stations seem to boil down to about this : cobs have feeding value for cattle and certainly should not be wasted . They have their highest feeding value with cattle of thin to moderate fleshing , especially when grazing on alfalfa or other // succulent pasture forages . In general , their value approximates poor to fair quality grass hay or the best straws . Since nearly all excess corn cobs are to be found in the corn belt , these findings are of most interest to corn-belt cattlemen . PROBLEMS IN MANAGEMENT Improper management of beef cattle can easily eliminate any possibility of profit . Such mistakes as using a sterile bull for several months without this defect being discovered , introducing brucellosis into a breeding herd , having calves come at the wrong season for the particular plan being followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foundering cattle by rushing them up to a full feed of grain , failing to immunize against prevalent diseases such as blackleg and anthrax , and permitting infestation with internal and external parasites ? all can prove costly . A survey of death losses in cattle showed a loss during the first month of one calf out of every ten dropped . Most of this loss was from respiratory diseases . After their first month of life only 2.4 per cent were lost . It was estimated that at least one-half of the losses could be prevented both easily and cheaply . Brucellosis ( Bang 's disease ) . The disease known as brucellosis constitutes one of the biggest hazards to any breeding herd , since it can cause the loss of a large percentage of calves . The test and slaughter plan that was so effective in the reduction of bovine tuberculosis ( only one out of 500 now are infected ) has not been employed on the area basis but rather on the individual herd basis . Even though calfhood vaccination is being used to supplement the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle tested during 1948 was still higher than that of 1938 but slightly under the high point of 1946 , when one out of every 20 cows tested was found to be infected with the disease . Herds that are continually subjected to re-infection from a neighbor 's infected herd , polluted streams , trading of cattle , or exhibiting at shows , apparently benefit from calfhood vaccination . This develops some immunity to the disease . Newer vaccines are being developed that offer still greater promise than the present Strain 19. // External parasites . Insects may be readily controlled through the use of the newer chemicals . DDT , Methoxychlor , and Lindane control most types of flies cheaply and effectively . Fly-free grazing cattle will gain from 15 to 75 more pounds per season than will similar cattle molested by flies . This means not only heavier cattle and more beef per acre , but also fatter cattle at the end of the season and therefore higher selling prices . No beef cattle producer should overlook this easy route to more profit . Ox warbles and their adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . First , the heel fly causes extreme commotion in the herd with both loss of grazing time and loss of weight from fright and running . Later , the ox warble , the larva of the heel fly , works its way to the back of the cattle causing extreme irritation and discomfort . Each grub finally punctures a hole in the animal 's hide through which it emerges to mature . These holes cause millions of dollars loss through damage to the leather produced from the hides . Control of the ox warble is cheap i // and simple ? through the use of rotenone just before the warble emerges in the early spring . Lice cause more damage than is realized . Lousy cattle are uncomfortable and lose much blood to the lice . Lice can be controlled with many treatments , but rotenone , DDT , or BHC are the newer ones . Shy breeding . This condition may be due to infections such as brucellosis and trichamoniasis , to overconditioning of the breeding animals , to extremely poor feeding , and to hereditary weaknesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to full profits from any breeding herd . Irregular breeders should be checked and the cause eliminated if possible . If not , the affected animals should soon find themselves in the stockyards . Castration and dehorning . Well-justified practices that should not be neglected are castration and dehorning . Commercial male calves that are to be kept past the veal stage should be castrated to reduce their annoyance to the rest of the herd and to produce a better market animal . Horns are a liability in any commercial program and should be eliminated either by dehorning or by the use of a polled sire . The polled strains of both the Hereford and the Shorthorn are being expanded and improved . They are rapidly approaching their horned cousins in average type and quality . It is conceivable that cattlemen of a few generations hence may no longer have to worry with the dehorning of commercial calves . These are but a few of the newer ideas and problems of beef cattle management . The older ones are even more numerous and still newer ones , such as " X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beef production , like other farming enterprises , is an increasingly complicated job that rewards the intelligent and industrious manager with satisfactory profits . Chapter 10 ? THE SHEEP INDUSTRY While the United States must be recognized as a major sheep country , it nevertheless ranks behind such countries as Australia and Russia . Prewar numbers give the more reliable measure of a country 's sheep industry since some , notably the United States and the United Kingdom , saw their sheep populations greatly reduced during the war . The prewar and postwar sheep populations of the ten leading sheep-raising countries are given by the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Table 26 . These figures show that sheep tend to concentrate in countries where large land areas are available for grazing purposes . SHEEP IN THE UNITED STATES The first sheep that came to the United States landed in Jamestown , Virginia , in 1609 . The importance of wool under early colonial con-165 // ditions was very great . In order to encourage wool production in this country , the colonial government passed a law in 1654 forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also passed to pro-vide for hanging any dog that bit or killed a sheep . The first woolen mill in this country was established near Boston in 1643 . The em bargo of 1812 caused the New England states to make sheep raising one of their major enterprises . The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 led to a rapid westward expansion into an area then , and still , well suited to sheep raising . Some idea of the rate with which the American sheep industry grew may be gained from the chart ( Figure 90 ) , which shows changes in the United States sheep population from 1870 to 1950 . An early peak in sheep numbers was reached in 1884 when there was estimated to have been 53,351,000 head of sheep on United States farms . The all-time peak was not reached until 1942 , when the esti mated number was 56,213,000 head . // In 1948 the gross farm income from sheep was reported to have been $413,433,000 . In the same year the swine industry grossed $4,319 , - 695,000 and the beef industry $5,317,881,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep industry , at least during the postwar boom period , is far overshadowed by both the swine and the beef industries . LEADING SHEEP STATES Sheep raising is usually thought of as a frontier industry . Its history in the United States has followed that pattern . In the early part of the nineteenth century such states as Vermont and Massachusetts were the leading sheep-producing states of the country . As the human population of the East increased and as the farm and range lands of the middle and far West became accessible , sheep raising moved westward . By 1945 some 82 per cent of all lambs were produced west of the Mississippi River . Vermont now has a mere 12,000 head . In 1773 the little island // of Martha 's Vineyard had as many sheep on it ( 20,000 ) as can now be found in Massachusetts and Rhode Island combined . The shortage of shepherds and the strong competition from more profitable enterprises has led to a drastic reduction of sheep numbers in many western states . The 11 western states had nearly 23 million head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were down to less than 14 million head . Even more startling declines were experienced by such states as Oregon which lost over 60 per cent of its sheep during the above period . Doubtless , much of this loss will be recovered as ex perienced help again becomes available and as such enterprises as beef cattle raising become comparatively less attractive . The Southeast , encouraged by the success of Kentucky , is showing signs of becoming a more important sheep-raising area . This is due to a general shift from a one-crop system to a soil-building , pasture system of farming . Sheep have been shown to thrive in this area since pheno thiazine and lead arsenate came into use for the control of internal parasites . The ten leading sheep states are given in Table 27 together with // their 1940 sheep populations for comparison . It is significant that all but two of these top ten states are in the range section . SYSTEMS OF SHEEP RAISING In general , the sheep industry of the United States divides itself into two areas ? the range and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest portion of our sheep are to be found in the range states . The reasons for this include the following : 1 . Low cost of production due to cheap grazing on both private and public lands , plus opportunity to handle sheep in large bands . 2 . Adaptability of sheep to the sparse grazing and scattered water supplies of the range area . 3 . Relative low cost and ease of transporting wool long distances to market . 4 . Ready market for both feeder lambs and crossbred breeding ewes throughout the farm states . 5 . Reduced parasite hazard due to semi-arid climate and less concentrated grazing . 6 . Proportionately lower losses from predatory animals , especially dogs . // The range area . The section known as the range area comprises parts or all of the western third of our states ? a section amounting to about 40 per cent of our total land area . Under range conditions sheep are wintered in flocks or bands of from 1000 to 4000 ewes at lower altitudes . The spring and fall are spent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitudes sometimes as far as 300 miles from their winter quarters . Summer-grazing bands number from 1000 to 1500 ewes with their lambs . As much as eight or ten acres of range per ewe is usually required . The typical range ewe carries a large proportion of fine-wool blood . In the Northwest the Rambouillet is used as the chief source of this blood . Some long-wool blood , such as the Lincoln , is used for size , ruggedness , and length of fleece . The newer breeds , such as the Columbia , Corriedale , and Panama , are fine-wool ? long-wool crosses and are proving increasingly popular . Much Merino blood is used in the Southwest . For the production of market lambs , Hampshire and Suffolk rams are very popular . This cross produces a black-faced or mottle-faced lamb than excels its mother in mutton conformation and rate of gain ? a popular lamb in the midwest feed lots . The ewe lambs are being used in increasing numbers as commercial breeding ewes in the farm states . Under range conditions the average lamb crop is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares with the 100 per cent or better lamb crop obtained in the farm states . The average fleece weight in the range states is about 8.5 pounds . This compares with Florida 's average of 3.2 pounds , the corn-belt average of 7.8 , and the national average of 8.0 pounds . The principal cost of sheep raising in the range area is labor . Feed ranks next , with death loss a close third . The farm states . The farm area specializes in small flocks of dualpurpose sheep . In these flocks wool represents from one-fourth to oneseventh of the gross income . For the United States as a whole the sale of wool produces about one-fourth of the total income from sheep . Flocks average between 20 and 25 ewes in size , but some may contain as many as 1000 to 2000 head . // The sheep are grazed on permanent or rotation pastures for from 5 to 12 months of the year , depending on the latitude . In the North , flocks are housed during the long winter , but in the South little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shropshire and Hampshire were predomi nant in the past , crossbred western ewes are now winning increasing favor . This is due to their hardiness , rustling ability , heavy fleece , early breeding tendency , strong milk flow , longevity , and ease of lambing . The white-faced ewe has been preferred in the corn belt , but the mottle-faced , Hampshire-cross ewe has been popularized by the Kentucky spring lamb program . The latter produces a somewhat typier lamb but lacks a little of the hardiness and longevity of the white-faced ewe . Some states prefer rams of the larger breeds because they sire larger , faster-gaining lambs . Kentucky farmers have always used a majority of Southdown rams . These sire lambs that are smaller , but blockier and meatier . The smaller heads and shoulders of the lambs by Southdown // bucks also mean easier lambing , especially in the case of yearling ewes . Also , our peacetime lamb market often discriminates against milk-fat spring lambs weighing more than 85 pounds at time of sale . Lambs sired by rams of the larger breeds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fatten if they are to reach desired finish at such weights . In the farm states most lambs are finished for market on the farm on which they are produced . Some go to market as " hothouse " lambs at a few weeks of age and carrying a milk finish at 30 to 40 pounds of weight . Others are sold as " Easter " lambs at 60 to 70 pounds of weight on the early spring market . The bulk of lambs in this area are sold as spring lambs at 75 to 90 pounds in weight from May through August . With good stock and good management , farm flocks can produce an average of eight pounds of wool and 100 pounds of lamb per ewe . This is nearly double the weight of lamb marketed per ewe in the range areas . Unfortunately , many farm flocks have not reached this state of improvement as witnessed by the three- , four- , and five-pound average fleece weights of many states . Southern states have an advantage over the northern states in cost of wintering ewes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , reports from northern states show an average feed requirement per ewe of over two bushels of grain and one-fourth ton of hay . Kentucky flocks require only one-third as much grain and 40 per cent as much hay . Internal parasites and sheep-killing dogs have long been the major hazards of sheep raising in the farm states . The new phenothiazine and lead arsenate treatments are very effective in controlling internal parasites and have brought new life and profit to the sheep industry in the farm ' states . Dogs are still without effective control and now become the leading hazard of the small-flock owner . Shotguns offer individual relief , but county sheep protective associations provide concerted pressure for strict enforcement of present dog laws . They also offer dogloss insurance on a cost basis . Lamb feeding . An enterprise carried on in over half our states , lamb feeding involves about one-fourth of the entire United States // lamb crop . These lambs are mostly western Iambs that did not have good enough forage to reach slaughter finish by marketing time . Some native lambs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cull beans , and peas furnish most of the concentrate used . Lambs usually go into the feed lots weighing from 60 to 70 pounds and are fed for about 90 days to a market weight of 90 to 100 pounds . This is a rather speculative venture because of heavy death losses , although vaccination is now reducing " feedlot-disease . " Colorado used to feed more lambs than any other state ? nearly onefourth of the total for the entire country . This distinction was for several years taken over by Nebraska , but has since been regained by Colorado . The six leading lamb-feeding states are now Colorado , Nebraska , Iowa , Kansas , Montana , and Ohio . These six states feed out over onehalf of all the grain-fed lambs in the United States . Some advantages of sheep raising as an enterprise are as follows : 1 . Sheep will utilize efficiently as large a percentage of soil-conserving crops as any other species of farm livestock . Only one per cent of the United States corn crop is fed to sheep . 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , at least in the farm states , and it will return profits commensurate with the skill employed . 3 . The raising of both sheep and cattle on a grassland farm means more meat per acre than can be produced by either one alone . 4 . The sale of wool and lambs means at least two income checks per year . 5 . Wool is of strategic importance during times of war . 6 . Sheep are the best way to control weeds on a farm . However , they should not be expected to live on weeds alone . Chapter 11 Mutton and Wool Types and Selection The breeds of sheep have traditionally been divided into the mutton and the fine-wool types . The distinction was based mainly on the chief use for which a particular breed was developed . The fine-wool type includes the Merino and the Rambouillet . The mutton type , on the other hand , includes both the long-wool breeds , such as the Lincoln and Cotswold , and also the medium-wool breeds such as the South-down , Hampshire , and Shropshire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the mutton and wool types has become less definite . While the Corriedale , Columbia and Panama are officially classed as mutton breeds , they are the product of a mutton-fine-wool cross and therefore fall between the two types in their major characteristics . In this respect they resemble the dual-purpose breeds of cattle , which are approximately halfway between beef and dairy in type . Since many parts of a sheep have names peculiar only to this spe-cies , it is important to have the correct nomenclature in mind . JUDGING MARKET LAMBS As in the judging of market animals of other species , the objective is to select the animal that will yield the greatest value of meat and by-products per hundred pounds of liveweight . The factors affecting market value may be grouped under condition , conformation , and quality . Condition . Condition , or fatness , has the greatest effect on dressing percentage . It also increases the plumpness , tenderness , and juiciness of the various cuts . However , the fat of lambs has a high melting point and , to many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts 176 // is relatively high . For these two reasons excessive condition is objec tionable on market lambs . The ideal market lamb should have enough condition to give him thickness and plumpness without any tendency toward softness , flabbiness , or an uneven and patchy covering of fat . // Conformation . The conformation of a market lamb influences both his dressing percentage and the shape and value of his various cuts of meat . Since the highest priced meat from a lamb carcass is found in the upper rib , loin , and leg , it is highly important that the lamb show fullness , thickness , and depth in these areas . It also follows that the lamb should show a small and neat head , neck , shoulder , and shank . A lamb with a flat back and wide loin is almost certain to yield rib and loin chops having a large " eye " of lean . The wider and fuller the rump ; the thicker , deeper , and plumper the leg ; and the deeper the twist ? the heavier will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the carcass weight and about one-half of the carcass value , so its importance can not be overlooked . Neatness of middle or paunch has an important effect on dressing percentage . Heavy-middled lambs // carry 10 to 20 pounds of excess fill . This may mean 6 to 9 per cent lower yield or dressing percentage on slaughtering . The neck , breast , flank , and shanks of a lamb find little demand in the retail market except as stew meat or lamburger . Presumably , the consumer would like the producer to supply a lamb carcass with nothing but leg , loin , and rib . Quality . Quality affects both the dressing percentage of a lamb as well as the quality and value of his carcass . Lambs with refined heads , light bone and light pelts give a higher yield at slaughter time . A distinction should be made between lambs showing a coarse wrinkly skin and those having merely a long growth of wool . The latter usually brings a sufficiently high price to more than offset its adverse affect on dressing percentage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the size of the bone in the various cuts , and possibly in the flavor of the meat . Coarse-boned , staggy lambs should be discriminated against . Buck lambs more than four months of age develop heavy heads , necks , and shoulders ? all cheap meat . They are , and should be , docked severely on the market . A summary of the points to be considered in judging market lambs follows : Table SAMPLE SET OF REASONS Hampshire Fat Wether Lambs I placed this class of Hampshire fat wether lambs 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 . In placing 2 over 3 , I must admit that 3 is the fatter lamb and stands somewhat closer to the ground . However , 2 is a firmer-fleshed , neater-middied lamb that is wider in the loin , deeper in the twist , and fuller in the leg of lamb . The 2 lamb is also more evenly covered over his back and ribs . He is neater in his shoulders and shows more quality in his head and bone . I fault the 3 lamb for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering , and for lacking somewhat in quality . I placed 3 over 4 and considered this to be an easy decision . The 3 lamb was by far the fatter , blockier , lower-set , and thicker lamb of the two . He was wider from front to rear , deeper in the loin and twist and fuller in the leg of lamb . I faulted 4 for lacking in finish and natural thickness . I considered 4 and 1 to be the closest pair in the class . I placed 4 over 1 mainly because he showed more quality and a much neater middle . The 4 lamb had a finer head and bone , was shorter in the neck , neater in the shoulder , and much trimmer in the middle . While 1 showed slightly more finish than 4 , I left 1 at the bottom of this class because he was very wasty in the middle . and somewhat coarse throughout . For these reasons I placed this class of Hampshire fat wether lambs 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 . JUDGING MUTTON-TYPE BREEDING SHEEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shifted from condition and conformation to conformation , quality , and breed type . Such things as feet and legs , set of ear , color markings , and quality and weight of fleece are given little if any consideration in the judging of market lambs . However , they are all of great importance in the judging of breeding sheep . In judging breeding sheep it is therefore necessary not only to have a knowledge of what constitutes acceptable finish . form , and quality , but also to have an exact knowledge of what constitutes acceptable breed characteristics and what factors contribute to the greatest productivity and longevity of the animal . It is easy to // see why the breeding sheep is much more difficult to select accurately . Unfortunately , there is a tendency on the part of some breeds and some breeders to place altogether too much emphasis on the fine points of the breed and thereby to minimize their productivity , longevity , and efficiency of gain . This tendency can easily lead to the extinction of a breed , since a large percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have quantity and efficiency of production if they are to stay in business . Conformation . The conformation of a breeding sheep should be very similar to that required of a top market Iamb . Certainly sheep with narrow loins , light legs or other faults can not be expected to produce top market lambs . In addition , rams should show definite signs of mas-culinity as evidenced by a strong head , a bold eye , a thick neck , a strong crest , and an impressive bearing . Ewes should be feminine in appear-ance . They should have sweet , refined heads , moderately long and // roomy middles , and easy-going dispositions . The breed points listed in Chapter 14 must be carefully followed , since each breed is jealous of its identifying characteristics . Quality . In breeding stock , quality is important because its lack af-fects not only the one animal itself , but possibly most of its offspring Since the fleece represents a sizable part of the annual production of sheep , it should receive considerable attention . In addition to the grade or fineness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staple brightness , light shrink , density , strength , and freedom from black fiber or kemp . Condition . In breeding stock , condition should merely serve to bring out the good points of the animal and to indicate an ability to fatten readily and smoothly . Natural fleshing is much to be desired over // tallow . For this reason , good judges discriminate severely against soft , sloppy handlers , since they invariably are sheep that have an excess of fat and therefore relatively less natural fleshing . Excessively fat sheep are poor breeding prospects , especially if more than a year of age . Such animals breed late , if at all . Fat ewes usually have difficulty in lambing and many are poor milkers . Fat rams are often sterile until late in the breeding season , and even then they are sluggish and slow . Unfortunately , many inexperienced purchasers are willing to be fooled by excessive finish , and they usually pass over the best milking ewes and the most regular producers or ignore the con-scientious breeder who sells his sheep in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production under farm conditions . On the other hand , thin , unhealthy sheep should be avoided as poor risks since they may be permanently damaged by nodular worm infestation ? or worse yet , be poor doers by nature . // Table SAMPLE SET OF REASONS Southdown Breeding Ewes I placed this class of Southdown Breeding Ewes 4 , 2 , 3 , 1 . In my top pair , 4 over 2 , I will admit that the number 2 ewe has a denser fleece ; but I placed 4 over 2 because she is a wider , deeper , lower-set , more compact ewe that shows more Southdown character about her head and ear . She is shorter and thicker in her neck , broader in her back and loin , // stronger in her top , thicker at the dock , deeper in the twist and has a plumper and firmer leg of mutton . I fault the number 2 ewe for being dark in her color markings and light in her leg of mutton . In my middle pair , 2 over 3 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant in favor of 3 that she is more desirable in her color markings . However , I prefer the number 2 ewe because she is a bigger , growthier ewe that shows more breeding and feeding capacity . She is plumper in the brisket , deeper in the heart girth , roomier in the middle , and stands on more bone . She also has a longer and finer fleece . I fault number 3 for being coarse in her fleece , light in her bone and undersized . In my bottom pair , 3 over 1 , I will grant that the number 1 ewe has a finer fleece and more rugged bone . But I placed number 3 over 1 because she is a lower-set , more compact type of ewe that has a more typical South-down ear . She is smoother in her shoulders , stronger in her back and stands on straighter hind legs . I fault number 1 for being plain in the head , open in the shoulders , weak in the back , crooked on the hind legs , and upstand-ing. // JUDGING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-wool breeds little or no emphasis was placed on their mutton-producing possibilities . In recent years some emphasis has been placed on their conformation as well as on their fleece . All fine-wool sheep are narrow , upstanding , uneven in width and lacking in natural fleshing as compared with sheep of the mutton breeds . Part of this difference is because the fine-wool sheep must be built to withstand the hardships and travel common to the range area . Part is also owing to the fact that wool is given first rank in importance over body conformation . Nevertheless , there is conscious selection for a more acceptable mutton conformation in the fine-wool breeds , since they realize that otherwise they can not hope to withstand the competition of such dual-purpose breeds as the Columbia . In judging the fine-wool breeds the same general description may be used , but these sheep should not be expected to approach the ideal in body conformation as closely as do the mutton breeds . Also the emphasis should be shifted , with the fleece alone receiving over onethird of the total consideration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors to be observed . Chapter 12 Market Classes and Grades of Sheep and Lambs The first step in a study of market classes and grades should be to become acquainted with market terminology . Some of the more common market terms are as follows : Sheep are ovine animals of all ages and both sexes . In common prac-tice , however , they are considered to be only those of approximately one year or more of age . Lamb is the term used commonly to refer to a sheep of either sex less than one year of age . Graduation from the lamb class into the yearling class is roughly indicated by the growth of the first pair of permanent teeth and by the inability to produce a clean break at the " break joint , " which is located just above the ankle . A ram is an uncastrated male sheep or lamb . Rams are also known as " bucks . " They are sold for both slaughter and breeding purposes . A wether is a male sheep or lamb which was castrated before it had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased for either slaughter or feeding purposes . A ewe is a female sheep or lamb . They may be purchased for either breeding , feeding , or slaughtering . A yearling is a sheep that is approximately one to two years of age . A two-year-old is a sheep of approximately two to three years of age . A mature sheep is a sheep of more than three years of age . A slaughter sheep or lamb is one purchased for immediate slaughter . A feeder is a sheep or lamb purchased for further feeding before it is slaughtered . A shearer is a sheep or lamb to be sheared before slaughter . A breeder is a sheep or lamb to be used for breeding purposes . Large 189 // numbers of crossbred ewe lambs and yearling ewes produced in the range states move , annually , into the farm states where they are used in the production of slaughter lambs . Hothouse lambs are 6- to 10-weeks-old lambs weighing from 30 to 60 pounds and marketed between Christmas and Easter . They must carry a high degree of finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs as distinguished from " old-crop " or " fed " lambs from the previous year 's crop . The term " spring , " by common custom , is dropped the first Monday in October . From that date until the first Monday in July they are known as lambs . After the first Monday of their second July they are known as yearlings . Market classes and grades of slaughter lambs . The official mar ket classes and grades of slaughter lambs ( shown in Table 28 ) are // given in U. S. Department of Agriculture Department Bulletin 1360 . Market classes and grades of slaughter sheep . All ovines of more than a year of age and purchased for immediate slaughter are classified ( see Table 29 ) according to the official U. S. Department of Agriculture classes and grades . // Market classes and grades of feeder sheep and lambs . A large percentage of the sheep and lambs that change hands in the course of a year are purchased for further feeding . This would apply . especially to those produced in the range areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are principally in or near the corn belt . The official classes and grades for feeder sheep and lambs ( see Table 30 ) are listed in U. S. Department of Agriculture Department Bulletin 1360 . Market Classes and Grades of Breeding Sheep . A very successful program for spring lamb production , initiated by Kentucky and spread ing to most of the farm states , calls for the use of a large crossbred , preferably black- or mottled-faced , western yearling ewe . This ewe is bred to a purebred mutton ram of very good type and better than av erage size . The Northeast has used large numbers of Dorset-Delaine // ewes for the production of hothouse lambs . Older ewes , culled from range flocks , sell at a considerable discount to producers in the farm states who can offer them a somewhat easier way of life . Strong competition for yearling ewes ready for breeding has led to a brisk trade in ewe lambs . The larger of these may be bred during their first fall , but the bulk should be carried a year before breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " breeding sheep " and are officially classified as shown in Table 31 . Age , soundness , and type are the principle factors that determine the market value of breeding sheep and lambs . Chapter 13 PRODUCTS AND BY-PRODUCTS OF SHEEP The principal products of the sheep industry are lamb , mutton , and wool . The relative importance of these products varies from one section to another . Sheep were first grown for wool . In the early days of our own Southwest , flocks of aged wethers were kept solely for their wool production . Even in recent years wool has maintained its posi-tion as a major source of income from sheep in the range areas . In the farm states , however , the sale of lamb produces up to 90 per cent ( with wool representing as little as 10 per cent ) of the annual income from the sheep enterprise . LAMB AND MUTTON Lamb is officially described by the U. S. Department of Agriculture as " the flesh of young animals of the ovine species of both sexes . The age at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the live animals is approximately 12 to 14 months . " Lamb carcasses are characterized by a relatively small size , ranging from 15 to 55 pounds in weight , with the most desirable carcass weights being from 35 to 45 pounds . Spring lamb is from lambs sold at weaning time and producing carcasses weighing 30 ? 45 pounds . Hothouse lamb is produced from young lambs grown out-of-season and slaughtered in the winter , yielding carcasses weighing from 15 to 30 pounds . The break joint is a temporary cartilage located about one-half inch above the ankles of a sheep . This joint will break readily in a lamb . As the animal matures , however , the joint is increasingly difficult to break . At the approximate age of two years the joint becomes smooth 196 // and completely grown together or ossified . This break joint is used as the main basis for differentiating between lamb and mutton carcasses . If the break shows four well-defined ridges that are smooth , moist , and red with blood , the carcass is definitely that of a lamb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustrous , pliable fat varying from creamy white to slightly pink in color . Mutton is the meat from any sheep that has passed the lamb stage . Mutton carcasses are commonly divided into " yearling mutton " and " mature mutton . " Yearling mutton is produced by sheep that are from 12 to 24 months of age when slaughtered . Yearling carcasses have harder , whiter bones than are found in lamb carcasses ; with darker , coarser flesh and firmer , whiter , and usually thicker fat on both the interior and exterior of the carcass . The break joint on a yearling carcass will show a rough uneven break of a whiter color , without the four well-defined ridges . Mature mutton carcasses are usually larger than lamb or yearling carcasses . The mature mutton carcass also shows more spread or bulge through the ribs , giving a distended , barrel-like appearance . The break joint refuses to break at this age , so mature mutton carcasses will show the round ankle joint only . The flesh of mature mutton will range from light to dark red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red of yearling mutton and the light to dark pink of lamb . The fat of mature mutton is white and very brittle . Approximately 93 per cent of all sheep slaughtered are lambs and yearlings , only 7 per cent being mature sheep . The average dressing percentage of all sheep slaughtered is about 45 per cent . Prime lambs will yield a dressing percentage of nearly 60 per cent . Their average carcass weight is about 42 pounds . Popularity of lamb and mutton . Lamb far excels mutton in popularity throughout most of the United States . Carcasses from mature sheep are either processed into soup , stew , and prepared meats or sold in areas that have large foreign-born populations . In some European countries little lamb is available and mutton is presumably preferred . The English people claim to prefer mutton to Iamb because of its stronger flavor and greater body . // The popularity of lamb varies greatly throughout the United States . Studies show that the per capita consumption of lamb in the Northeast and in some of the Pacific Coast states exceeds 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the north-central states little lamb is con-sumed ? little more than a pound per person per year . The low lamb consumption of at least some of these areas is not due to a lack of pro-duction . Kentuckians , who produce a good deal of top-quality lamb , eat only one and one-half pounds per person per year . In 1945 it was calculated that 82 per cent of our lamb was produced west of the Mis-sissippi River , and 78 per cent of it was consumed east of the Missis-sippi . The average annual consumption of lamb in the United States for the past 50 years has been 6.28 pounds per person . This represents only 4.4 per cent of the total meat consumed during that period . In contrast to this , the people of the United States during the period 1899 to 1948 // chose to consume an average of 47.5 per cent pork , 42.8 per cent beef , and 5.3 per cent veal . There seem to be two major reasons why lamb is the least popular meat in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imagined or actual dislike for its flavor by a large percentage of our population . Studies have shown that people in the higher income groups eat more lamb than those with limited incomes . This is mainly because a pound of rib lamb chops yields less than one-half a pound of lean meat , whereas a pound of pork chops yields nearly two-thirds of a pound of lean meat . The lower dressing percentage of lamb calls for a relatively higher price for the carcass . Another factor is the difficulty experienced by meat markets in selling the breast , shank , and shoulder of the carcass even at bargain prices . Apparently people that buy lamb want the leg or loin only . Improved merchandizing offers a partial solution to this latter problem . By converting these less desirable cuts into " mock ducks , " rolled shoulders , and lamburger , markets can move them at profitable prices and thereby reduce the necessary selling prices for the legs and loins . The pungent " mutton " flavor that many people object to in lamb varies with the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding and slaughtering . Most of this flavor is carried in the fat ; therefore , the leaner cuts are less objectionable . However , carcasses from excessively fat , mature ewes of some breeds have little of this flavor , whereas lambs of other breeding will show much of it . Breeding and age also affect the shape of the carcass , the percentage of bone , and the yield of carcass . People who have developed a liking for good lamb enjoy it more than any other meat when served either cold or piping hot . Most lamb contains a high percentage of lean and low fat content . It is therefore a valuable meat for reducing and other special diets . Lamb is high in protein and ranks with the other meats as a good to excellent source of minerals and vitamins . Classes and grades of lamb and mutton . Lamb carcasses are officially graded as Prime , Choice , Good , Commercial , Utility , and Cull , // depending on their respective conformation , finish , and quality . A prime lamb carcass should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep loin , a full and well-rounded back , thick and well-fleshed ribs , a full yet neat shoulder and breast , a short and thick neck , and nearly even width from front to rear . The prime lamb car cass should have a smooth , even , creamy-white covering of firm fat over the exterior of the carcass . Soft , over-finished carcasses and thin carcasses are both discriminated against . The prime lamb carcass should show much quality as evidenced by a fine bone , pink meat , creamy to pinkish fat , freedom from roughness or patchiness in skeleton and cov ering of fat , and a fine grain or texture of the lean . Yearling mutton carcasses are also graded Prime , Choice , Good , Commercial , Utility , and Cull . The same standards of conformation , finish , and quality are used , but the yearling carcass lacks the compact ness , plumpness , and quality of the lamb carcass . // Mature mutton carcasses are given the same grades as lamb and yearling carcasses . Mature mutton carcasses are larger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering of fat than either lamb or yearling carcasses . Their meat is also darker and lacking in quality . Wholesale and retail cuts of lamb . Most lamb and mutton car casses reach the wholesaler as whole carcasses . Many retailers also pur202 INTRODUCTORY ANIMAL SCIENCE chase unbroken carcasses . The major wholesale cuts are the hindsaddle and the foresaddle , each representing about 50 per cent of the carcass . The division is made between the twelfth and thirteenth ribs , with one pair of ribs remaining on the hindsaddle . The subdivisions of these two major wholesale cuts vary greatly on different markets according to local customs and demands . The Chicago method has become more or less standard and includes the following wholesale cuts : Leg ? a part of the hindsaddle divided from the loin where the spine curves upward or at about the sixth lumbar vertebrae . Loin ? a part of the hindsaddle including the flanks and one pair of ribs and separated from the leg as indicated above . // Hotel rack ? a subdivision of the foresaddle including nine pairs of ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foresaddle containing three or four pairs of ribs , including the neck but usually excluding the breast and shank . Breast and shank ? a cut containing the lower ends of twelve pairs of ribs and the foreshank as well as the breastbone. // The approximate percentages of the dressed Iamb carcass found in the various wholesale cuts are as follows : WOOL Wool has been used for clothing for at least 6000 years . Prehistoric sheep produced a fine short wool protected by long coarse outer hairs . Careful breeding has eliminated most of these coarse hairs , but even today some may be found on the tails and outer thighs of several breeds . This is called " kemp . " Enough wool is used in the United States annually to make four suits for every man in the United States , if it were all used for that pur pose . It has become our second most important source of income for the sheep industry . For the prewar period , 1935-39 , wool ( including pulled wool from sheep that had been slaughtered ) represented 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1947 , how-ever , this was reduced to 35 per cent . In some of the native lamb states , during periods of high meat prices , wool brings in only 10 to 15 per cent of the gross income , whereas in the range states it often amounts to the major part of the income from the sheep enterprise . Wool characteristics . Wool is a fiber produced chiefly by sheep and possessing a number of unusual characteristics . It differs from hair in that it is smaller in diameter ; the outer or epidermal cells of hair are fastened to the cortex to form a relatively smooth surface , whereas the epidermal cells of wool overlap each other , with their outer ends free from the cortex and possessing a rough edge . The wool fiber therefore somewhat resembles an elongated pine cone . The finer wools possess a distinct crimp , whereas hair at best is only wavy . The finer wool fibers possess more scales to the inch than the coarse // wool fibers , and these scales have rougher edges . Consequently , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , therefore , said to have greater " felting " property . Studies by the U. S. Department of Agriculture have shown the average diameter of the wools produced by several common breeds of sheep to be as follows : Oxford ? 1/581 of an inch ; Hampshire ? 1/769 of an inch ; Southdown ? 1/865 of an inch ; and Merino1/1,194 of an inch . Some fibers have been checked that measured 1/1,875 of an inch . In other words , it would take nearly two thousand of such fibers laid side by side to equal one inch . A pound of such wool after scouring may be spun into a thread that is thirty miles long . The growth of wool also varies with the breed and the individual from less than an inch to nearly one and one-half feet in one year . Wool , as it is sheared from the sheep , contains the following impurities , which total from one-fourth to six-sevenths of the fleece weight : 1 . Yolk , or wool grease , which tends to preserve the wool fiber while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before the wool is used . This yolk is made into cosmetics , ointments , and belt dressing . 2 . Suint , which is closely associated with the yolk , but different in that it is soluble in water . 3 . Foreign materials consisting chiefly of sand , burrs , and chaff . These must be removed from the noils and clothing wools by a process called " carbonization . " This consists of treating the wool in dilute acid and then drying it thoroughly . This chars the organic matter so that it can be removed by crushing and shaking . This extra manufacturing step costs the manufacturer a considerable sum , which explains why " burry " and " chaffy " wools sell at a discount . These three impurities added together cause what is known as " shrinkage . " The shrinkage of wools varies with the breed . Fine-wool sheep have more yolk and suint in their fleeces . Well-fed and wellhoused sheep also have more grease in their fleeces . Shrinkage also varies with the location in which the sheep are kept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because this dirt gets into the fleeces . Cockleburs and chaff from poorly designed hay racks also result in heavy shrinking fleeces . Studies have shown the following to be aver-age shrinkages for wool produced in the farm states : Fine wools produced in the range areas shrink up to 80 to 85 per cent , but probably average about 65 or 70 per cent . Shrinkage is , nat urally , a very important factor in determining wool values . Wool differs from other fibers in one or more of the following re spects : Elasticity . Wool is quite elastic and therefore resists wrinkling , bagging and tearing . This characteristic helps wool fabrics to drape gracefully . Conductivity . Wool is the best of fibers for holding in body heat and also for keeping heat out . This is due to its insulating value and to the open , porous nature of fabrics made from it . Strength . Wool fibers and fabrics are unusually strong and du rable . Inflammability . Wool is slower to burn than many fabrics . When burned it gives off a pungent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases . Dyeing properties . Wool is one of the easiest fibers to dye . Be-cause the dye penetrates easily into the fiber it is quite permanent . Grades of wool . There are two common systems for grading wool . The one with which American farmers are most familiar is the Amer ican or " blood " system . This originated in colonial days when Merino wool was designated as " fine " and other wools were compared with it . The term " blood " probably originated with the idea that different frac208 INTRODUCTORY ANIMAL SCIENCE tional quantities of Merino blood in a sheep would produce correspond ing degrees of fineness in the wool they produced . The second common system of wool grades is known as the English or Bradford system . This is based on the approximate number of hanks of yarn that may be spun from a pound of scoured wool . A hank of wool yarn is 560 yards . The length of the fiber affects the spinning count . It is also possible to increase the spinning count of a given fine wool beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exact system than the " blood " system and is therefore used almost ex clusively by the international wool trade . // In addition to their fineness and shrink , wools are also graded ac-cording to their length of staple into subgroups known as fine staple , strictly combing , baby combing , French combing , clothing , and stubby . For all practical purposes these may be reduced to combing , French combing , and clothing . The official grades of wool are given in Table 32 . The grades of wool produced by the various breeds of sheep are given in Chapter 14 . Worsted , woolen , and felt . A worsted fabric is the smoothest , hardest , and longest wearing of all wool fabrics . Only wool of combing length can be used . In producing worsted , the clean wool is first combed in order that the long fibers will be laid parallel to each other and also to remove all short fibers or " noils . " The long fibers are combed into a long rope-like strand known as a " wool top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller diameters and finally spun into worsted yarn from which worsted fabrics may be woven . Wool that is too short to be combed may be carded together with no attempt made to remove the short fibers or to place the fibers in a position parallel to each other . Woolen fabrics made from such yarn are softer and fuzzier but possess less strength than worsteds . Felts are made from short fibers that are pounded together while moist and hot . Under such treatment the serrations of the wool fibers // firmly interlock to form a solid mass of pressed felt such as is used in banners . This fabric possesses the least strength of the three . Wool terms . The wool trade uses a number of terms that have spe cific commercial meanings . A few of these follow : Black and gray fleeces contain a great deal or a small amount , re spectively , of black fibers . These fibers prevent its use for the making of white or light-colored goods and therefore reduce its value consid erably . Breech or britch wool is produced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool in the fleece . Bright wool is produced east of the " territory " and " semibright " areas and possesses a cleaner nature and more uniform shrinkage than the two other types . Buck wool is wool from rams . It is usually heavier in shrinkage and coarser than ewe or wether wool . // Burry , seed . and chaffy wools contain burs , seeds , and chaff , respectively . Clothing wool is wool that is too short to grade as combing . Combing wool is wool that is both long enough and strong enough to meet the standards . Cotted fleeces have their fibers tangled together in such a way as to require special processing . Certain minor breeds produce cotted fleeces as do some of the long-wool sheep after illness . Dead or murrain wools are taken from newly-dead or decomposed sheep , respectively . French combing wool is wool that is shorter than strictly combing wool yet long enough to be combed on the French style of combs . Grease wool is wool as shorn from the sheep and before processing in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not take dye and is therefore seriously discriminated against . When present , it is usually found in the britch wool . Lanolin is refined wool grease used principally for cosmetics . Mouton is a type of fur made by a special process from sheep skins . Noils are short fibers removed from scoured wool during the combing process . Pelt is the skin of a sheep with the wool on . Persian lamb is a tightly curled lustrous Karakul lamb skin . Reprocessed wool is wool that has previously been made into merchandise but was never used by the consumer . Reused wool is wool that has been made into merchandise and used by the consumer before being reworked into other merchandise . Semibright wool is produced in Oklahoma and the eastern parts of Kansas , Nebraska , North and South Dakota , and in parts of Missouri , Iowa , Minnesota , and Wisconsin . This wool is stained by soil but scours out white . Southern wool is produced in the southeastern states from unimproved sheep of uneven type and quality . Tags are locks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wool produced in Washington , Montana , Idaho , Wyoming , Nevada , Utah , and Colorado and in the western parts of North and South Dakota , Kansas , and Nebraska . Wools produced in Texas , California , and Oregon are known by the name of the state in which they are produced . Virgin wool is wool that has never been used before in fabrics , as contrasted with reworked or reused wool . Warp ? the threads of a fabric that run lengthwise . Weft ( woof ) ? the threads of a fabric that run crosswise . Wool production . The United States produces about 12 per cent of the world 's wool . Nearly one-third of all the world 's wool is grown in Australia and New Zealand . Argentina produces over 10 per cent and the Union of South Africa about 7 per cent . Texas is the leading wool-producing state of the United States , producing nearly one-fourth of our wool , followed in order by Wyoming , Montana , California , and Utah . The average fleece weight has run close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a tremendous improvement since 1840 , when the average fleece weight was less than 2 pounds . Wyoming had the highest prewar average fleece weight , which was 9.6 pounds . Florida was lowest with 3.2 pounds or just one-third as much wool per sheep . Wool is usually sheared from sheep once a year in the spring . Experiments have shown an advantage in gains from shearing late lambs in July . Therefore , some sheep raisers , especially those with purebred lambs that are not to be shown that fall , shear all their lambs . Shearing of breeding ewes and rams just before the breeding season is said to bring about earlier and more uniform conception . This is still to be proved scientifically . Wool should always be tied with paper twine . Binder twine will shed ravelings that can not be separated from the wool and therefore damage it for the most profitable uses . Prices of wool fluctuate violently despite an import tariff of from 24 to 34 cents per pound of clean wool on everything except carpet wools , which are admitted free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in 1932 , when wool brought 8.6 cents per pound . Sixteen years later it was worth about six times as much per pound . Mohair . Mohair resembles coarse wool and is sheared from Angora goats . It is used principally in the manufacture of upholstery materials , summer suiting , draperies , coat fabrics , and trimmings . Purebred An gora goats will produce up to 10 pounds of mohair and are frequently sheared twice a year . The average production of mohair is about 5 pounds per goat . Mohair shrinks from 15 to 25 per cent when scoured . In 1946 , when grease wool sold for an average of 42.3 cents per pound , mohair brought an average price of 61.1 cents per pound . The United States is a leading producer of mohair . Texas has over 90 per cent of the Angora goats in the United States . Other states hav ing some are New Mexico , Arizona , Oregon , Missouri , Utah , and Cali fornia . The total United States production of mohair in 1949 was 14,633 , - 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // LAMB BY-PRODUCTS The percentage value of the by-products from lamb is greater than the by-products from cattle , calves , or hogs . Swift and Company reports these figures in Table 33.1 It may be noted that the sheep pelt repre sents nearly one-fifth of the total value of the market sheep or lamb . A complete list of the by-products derived from sheep is given in Figure 118 . Chapter 14 ? THE BREEDS OF SHEEP Americans in one section or another seem to have been willing to sample many of the world 's 200 breeds of sheep as they became avail-able . Dozens of breeds of sheep have been tried under our varying con ditions , and many have been found wanting in one respect or another . Great Britain has supplied many breeds of considerable merit , but im portant breeds have also been imported from France , Spain , and New Zealand . In more recent years several new and very promising breeds have been developed in the United States by crossbreeding and rigid selection . The common breeds of sheep are usually classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the present day popularity of the ten most common breeds in the United States . A com parison of the two columns of figures will give a good indication as to which breeds have been popular in this country and also which ones 216 // are winning new popularity . For instance , the Merino registered only one-half of 1 per cent of its total during 1947 , whereas the Columbia breed registered 39 per cent of its total in 1947 , or five times as many // as the Merino , which once was the leading breed in America . As years go on and sheep raising conditions change , other shifts in popularity will occur and still more new breeds will appear . Breed characteristics . Most breeds of sheep have distinctive features that distinguish them from all other breeds . These characteristics include difference in weight and type of fleece ; color markings ; presence or absence of horns ; size and carriage of ear ; extension of wool over the face , belly , and legs ; size ; and body conformation . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success can be achieved in buying , judging , and breeding . Table 35 summarizes the more important characteristics of ten most popular breeds of sheep . The mature weights are for typical sheep in high condition . Breed history . Two reasons probably explain why Great Britain provided the world with so many breeds of sheep . In the first place , the British farmer was a true stockman in every sense of the word , and he enjoyed selecting and breeding for new levels of adaptability and performance . Secondly , transportation facilities were poor in the early days , and close breeding was the inevitable result . This plus the Britisher 's skillful selection consistently produced the uniformity and prepotency required of any successful breed . The greatest total influence of the world 's sheep population has been exerted by Spain 's contribution , the Merino ? either directly or through its offspring the Rambouillet of France . This influence will be noted as the following brief breed histories are studied . MEDIUM-WOOL BREEDS The Hampshire . The Hampshire originated in south-central England from a blending of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Wiltshire with the Berkshire Knot . The latter breed was also large and horned but had dark faces and legs . After 1800 these sheep were repeatedly crossed with the Southdown . About 1834 William Humphrey of Hampshire began developing the Hampshire as we know it today . By 1840 they somewhat resembled // the Southdown and were known as West Country Down Sheep . The Hampshire Down Breeders Association was organized in 1889 . Hampshires were brought to this country as early as 1836 , but by 1864 the identity of all these had been lost . New importations starting in 1881 introduced the improved Hampshire to America . The Ameri can Hampshire Sheep Association was organized in 1889 . The Hampshire has had its greatest popularity in the Western range areas where the size , substance , and vigor of the rams adapt them to use on the fine wool range ewes for the production of black- and mottled-faced feeder lambs . Thousands of ewe lambs from this cross are also used in the spring lamb states , notably Kentucky , where they are bred to purebred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two rather distinct types of Hampshire exist in America today . The // western breeders , keeping their range customers in mind , prefer a larger , more rugged , more upstanding , and plainer-faced sheep . Breed ers in the farm states place the emphasis on mutton type and quality . The eastern Hampshire is therefore slightly smaller than his western brothers and also lower-set , more compact , finer-boned , and more // heavily wooled on the face , ears , and legs . These characteristics together with the higher rate of gain that Hampshire-sired lambs will make , are helping the breed to give the Shropshire and Southdown breeds strong competition in the farm states . The strongest competitor to the Hampshire as a range sire is the Suffolk . Hampshire ewes have a very high percentage of twins and a substantial number of triplets averaging about 1.75 lambs per ewe . The Shropshire . The Shropshire breed of sheep originated in the west-central section of England . It was developed from several native types of sheep , with crosses of Southdown , Cotswold , and Leicester blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These forerunners of the modern Shropshires were described about 1800 as nimble , hardy , horned , and with a black , brown , or spotted face . They then sheared about 2 ? pounds of wool of a coarse nature . By 1859 the breed was given a separate show classification at the English Royal and within a few years was the most numerous and popular breed at that leading show . The English Shropshire Society was established in 1882 and published its first flock book two years later . The Shropshire first came to America in 1855 , when a few were brought to Virginia . The American Shropshire Registry Association was organized in 1884 . Until recent years the popularity of this breed in America was unequaled , and the association had become the largest in the world . Much of this popularity was due to the dual-purpose nature of the breed . It not only produces a heavy fleece of long staple and good quality but it also produces a large number of lambs ( 1.5 per ewe ) that make fast gains and are of better-than-average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Shropshire have appealed to many small flock owners in the farm states . However , in areas of specialization ? such as the range states , the hothouse lamb areas , and the spring lamb section , including Kentucky and bordering areas ? the Shropshire has had to give way to breeds that excel in certain points , such as the Hampshire with its ruggedness and rate of gain , the Southdown and its unsurpassed quality and mutton type , or the Dorset with its unsurpassed milking qualities . The main defects still existing to more or less degree in the Shro INTRODUCTORY ANIMAL SCIENCE shire breed are a lack of fullness in the leg of mutton and twist , a tendency to become " wool blind " due to the excessive covering of wool on the face , and a large percentage of lambs showing the physical de fect of the lower eyelid known as entropion , or " turned-in eyelid . " Lambs so born will lose the sight of affected eyes unless the condition is quickly corrected . The heavy wool covering extending over the scrotum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rams are often sterile until cool weather sets in . The Corriedale . The breed known as the Corriedale originated about 1879 in New Zealand from the crossing of Merino ewes with Lincoln and , in a fewer cases , English or Border Leicester rams . It was developed for a specific purpose , namely , to do a better job of producTHE // ing both wool and mutton . The New Zealand Sheep Breeders Associa tion started publishing records of Corriedale sheep in 1911 . Now the great majority of New Zealand 's 33 million sheep are either purebred Corriedales or crossbreds of the Corriedale type . This breed has also proved popular in Australia , South Africa , and America . Corriedales were first brought to the United States in 1914 by the United States Department of Agriculture . The American Corriedale Association was organized in 1915 and has since led its breed to third rank in the United States . The Corriedale produces an average of about 1.25 lambs per ewe . The lambs make good gains and yield acceptable carcasses . However , they lack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of the spe226 INTRODUCTORY ANIMAL SCIENCE cialized mutton breeds in shape and quality of carcass . With greater hardiness , heavier fleeces , and less face wool than the Shropshire they are finding much favor as a general purpose breed in many parts of the United States . The Columbia . The Columbia represents another attempt to de velop a sheep of greater utility than is present in the more specialized breeds . Its development started on the King Ranch of Laramie , Wyo ming , in 1912 , and in 1917 it was taken over by the United States Department of Agriculture at its Dubois , Idaho , Sheep Experiment Station . This breed was founded by crossing Lincoln rams on Rambouillet , instead of Merino , ewes in order to obtain a larger sheep than the Cor riedale . This goal has been achieved and Columbia ewes average nearly 20 pounds more in weight than the Corriedale ewes . The uniformity of this very young breed , and its ability to breed true to type is a tribute to its developers , who employed very close breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was organized in 1941 . The breed has rapidly climbed to fifth place in popularity , no doubt because of its large size , heavy fleece , heavy lambs , and general utility . While the Columbia lacks some of the mutton qualities and prolificacy // of the Corriedale , it nevertheless bids fair to become very popular in the range states . The Suffolk . Native to southeastern England , the Suffolk came from a cross of Southdown and Old Norfolk sheep that were common to that section . Some indication of the influence exerted by the South-down is to be had from the description of the Old Norfolk . The breed was a durable , wild , and horned breed of long body and longer legs . The Southdown improved the form , meatiness , and early maturity while also removing the horns . The name " Suffolk " and a separate clas sification at the local show both came in 1859 . The Suffolk Sheep Society was organized in England in 1886 . The first Suffolk importation to America came in 1888 . The Ameri can Suffolk Flock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the two present associations , the American Suffolk Sheep Society and the National Suffolk Sheep Association . The breed // did not expand in this country as rapidly as most until its remarkable activity and rustling qualities under range conditions were discovered . This , together with its smoother body than the Hampshire , the smaller heads and shoulders and consequent easier delivery of its lambs as compared with the Hampshire 's ( and the heavy milk flow of the Suffolk ewes ) seem to indicate a very bright future for this breed in some of our range areas . The average lamb crop is 1.35 lambs per ewe . // The main shortcomings of the Suffolk breed are the excessive amount of black fiber throughout the fleece and the light weight of the fleece , which is due both to short staple and lack of covering on legs and belly . The main usefulness of this breed would seem to be for crossing purposes . The Southdown . In addition to being the oldest of the Down breeds and probably the oldest of all British breeds of sheep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the sheep world in that it possesses more carcass quality and finer mutton type than any other breed of sheep yet developed . The breed originated in south-eastern England from native Sussex sheep , which were small , dark , occasionally horned , light-fleeced , but heavy-quartered . It is difficult to fix the date of origin for this breed . John Ellman , its first improver , began his work in 1780 and made great strides in improving the form // and carcass qualities of the Southdown . The early and active participa tion of the English nobility in improving the breed and the skillful and continued work of men like Jonas Webb resulted in a breed of remarkable uniformity , prepotency , and mutton characteristics . It is interesting to note that despite the very early start of this breed in England , American breeders organized their American Southdown Breeders Association in 1882 , at least eight years before the English Southdown Sheep Society was organized . Some authorities credit the Southdown with having reached America as early as 1648 . Since this was 132 years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very much unimproved . By 1803 known importations were made and many more followed . Real popularity of the Southdown and all other mutton breeds had to wait until the Merino boom was deflated about 1815 . The breed owes its present popularity to two characteristics , namely , its unexcelled carcass and its prepotency . Proof of its superiority as a mutton producer is to be had in its record at the International Live232 INTRODUCTORY ANIMAL SCIENCE stock Exposition . In this supreme testing ground the Southdown has won 60 per cent of the grand champion wether awards , an unbroken string of 30 fat lamb carlot awards , and 60 per cent of the dressed carcass awards . The Southdown is a compact , low-set , thick animal with unsurpassed quality and a very high percentage of lean meat to bone . The quality and flavor of the meat is also unusual . The greatest concentration of Southdowns in America is to be found in the spring lamb area centered on Kentucky . In this one state are to be found one-third of the registered Southdowns and enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the purebred South-downs in America . The reason for this popularity is the way in which the Southdown crosses with the Hampshire X range ewe breeding females imported by the thousands from the Northwest . The milk and size of the mother and the prepotent mutton characteristics of the sire // combine to produce an 85-pound market topping lamb in about four months . The breed lacks the size , wool production , milking qualities , rugged ness , and fecundity to compete by itself as a commercial lamb and wool producer . Slightly over one lamb raised per ewe may be expected . The ewes are poor milkers and are deficient in mother instinct . Newborn Southdown lambs are rather weak and difficult to raise . Many commer cial sheep producers would like to have a larger Southdown without sacrificing any of its present mutton type or quality . Several other breeds have won ground during the war as sires of market lambs be-cause of the Southdown 's lack of size . The present breeding trend to-ward somewhat larger Southdowns together with the demand for lighter market lambs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in favor of the Southdown. // The Oxford . Formerly known as the " Oxford Down , " the Oxford was developed in south-central England . The breed is a relatively young one , having originated in 1833 through the crossing of Cotswold rams on Hampshire ewes . While some Southdown blood was introduced near the beginning , little evidence of it is to be found in the present-day Oxford . The Oxford was first recognized as a breed by the Royal Show in 1862 , and the English Oxford Down Sheep Breeders Association of Great Britain was established in 1888 , six years after the American Oxford Down Record Association was organized . The first importation of Oxfords to America was made in 1846 . The breed has seen its greatest popularity in the northern states and Canada . The size of the Oxford is unsurpassed . Its lambs grow rapidly , but are not noted for their finish or quality . The breed is also distinguished by its broad , firm top and the characteristic top-knot left on the poll // when the Oxford is trimmed for show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its ability to cross well on other breeds . Its tendency to sluggishness has prevented its widespread acceptance for that purpose in the range areas . The Dorset . Formerly known as the " Dorset Horn , " the Dorset originated in southern England . The official version of its origin calls for the very early crossing of Merinos from Spain on the native stock . Other sources attribute the origin to native sheep crossed with Somerset , Southdown , and Leicester intruders . In any event , the breed was recognized at the Royal Show in 1862 , and the Dorset Horn Sheep Breeders Association was organized in 1891 , the same year that the forerunner to our present Continental Dorset Club was formed . The first Dorsets came to America in 1885 . The breed has been especially popular in Pennsylvania , which in recent years has produced // nearly half the Dorsets in this country . The breed is distinctive in many ways . Both sexes have horns . The ewes will breed at almost any season of the year , and some producers raise three Iamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of Merino blood being in the breed . The ewes are the heaviest milkers of all sheep common to this country , having been used for dairy purposes at one time in England . Dorset ewes produce many twins and triplets with a 150 to 175 per cent lamb crop not unusual . The Dorset is ideally adapted to crossing with the Merino to produce ewes for the hothouse lamb enterprise . Despite the numerous unusual and valuable characteristics of the breed , it has failed to achieve widespread acceptance in the United States . Its light fleece and need for plentiful feed supplies seem to have ruled against it in the range areas where wool represents the major source of income , where earliness of breeding is already available through the Rambouillet , and where feed supplies are often scanty . // LESSER MEDIUM-WOOL BREEDS The Cheviot . Included in this classification is the Cheviot , from the Cheviot hills of Scotland . This breed was described as early as 1470 . It is noted for its white face , ears , and legs that are completely free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its unsurpassed hardiness and mother instinct ; and its long-staple wool of exceptionally low shrinkage . The Panama . The breed known as the Panama was developed in America and results from crossing Rambouillet rams on Lincoln ewes . Being from the same cross as was used to produce the Columbia , ex cept with sexes reversed , one would expect the two breeds to be very similar . Without the active support given the Columbia it has not ex panded or improved as rapidly . // The Romeldale . The original Romeldale resulted from a Romney ram and Rambouillet ewe cross made in California . The breed is re-ported to be smaller than the Columbia , but possessing finer fleeces . The Southdale . Originated by the United States Department of Ag riculture , the Southdale came from a Southdown-Corriedale cross made in an effort to improve the carcass characteristics of the Corriedale . This has been done , but the lack of uniformity and distinctiveness threaten to limit its popularity . The Targhee . This breed has been developed by the United States Department of Agriculture since 1926 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . The Targhees carry about three-fourths Rambouillet blood , but they benefit in body size and length of fleece from their Lincoln ancestor . They are very hardy , rugged sheep that are well adapted to range conditions . The average Targhee ewe shears // eleven pounds of grease wool with a three-inch staple . There is as yet no registry association for this breed . The Tunis . A fat-tailed sheep , the Tunis originated in northern Africa and has been present in this country for years without experiencing any real popularity . The Black-faced Highland . A very hardy breed from the highlands of Scotland , the Black-faced Highland is noted principally for its exceptional hardiness , its long fleece , and its mean and wild disposition . The Karakul . Because of its unusual characteristics , it is difficult to classify the Karakul . Its principal value is for the production of lamb pelts used for fur of a rather high value .
