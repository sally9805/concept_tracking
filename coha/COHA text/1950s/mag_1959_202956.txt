THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE ( 311 pp. ) - Richard Condon-McGraw-Hill ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> The cultural handicappers who tick off lists of the Ten Best Books To Be Stranded in Toledo With have missed a bet . Far more interesting might be a compilation of the Ten Best Bad Novels-books whose artistic flaws are mountainous but whose merits , like Loreleis on the rocks above , keep on luring readers . A place on such a list would go to Author Condon 's second novel , an almost complete catalogue of humanity 's disorders , including incest , dope addiction , war , politics , brainwashing and multiple murder . The book carries a superstructure of plot that would capsize Hawaii , and badly insufficient philosophical ballast . Yet Condon distributes his sour , malicious humor with such vigor and impartiality that the novel is certain to be read and enjoyed . <P> The Pavlov Route . Man 's fate , as Condon sees it , is to work hard , sacrifice much , lead an intelligent , just and fruitful life , and then show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " later , like the blind beggars toppling after their blind leader in Bruegel 's chillingly ironic painting , all the author 's characters stumble into the ditch of mortality . Satirist Condon is not afraid to set up outrageously improbable situations to achieve his effects . In his first novel , The Oldest Confession ( 1958 ) , an Achilles among criminals was brought to heel while trying to hijack Goya 's The Second of May , from the Prado . In the current fable , a brilliant Chinese disciple of Pavlov-a sort of Marxist Dr. Fu Manchu-directs the capture , brainwashing and reflex-conditioning of an entire American patrol during the Korean war . Before grinning Russian brasshats , he shows off his success . The Americans puff contentedly on yak dung cigarettes and delicately avoid G.I. profanity-they imagine they are attending a meeting of the garden club in Spring Valley , N.J. They are so thoroughly Pavloved , in fact , that they are ready to commit murder on signal . <P> The soldiers are turned loose , each carefully convinced by the brain-conditioner that his unit has wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of a tall , dour sergeant . The leader of the patrol recommends the sergeant for the Medal of Honor , and he returns to the U.S. amid press-led drums and bugles , unaware that he is a walking time bomb conditioned to murder at the command of a Stateside operator . <P> Oedipal Wreck . Ensuing events follow each other to confusion like derailed freight cars . They involve the sergeant 's stepfather , a Senator who trades on his war wound and resembles McCarthy as played by Lou Costello , and his mother , a megalomaniac who maneuvers the Senator like a windup toy and makes an Oedipal wreck of her son .
