Sir : <P> The Democratic Party has two major objections to the Eisenhower ticket : 1 ) Eisenhower 's health , and 2 ) Richard Nixon . I would strongly suggest that the Democratic Party at their convention nominate Eisenhower by acclamation , and then nominate Stevenson as vice-presidential candidate . This would settle both the problems , since Eisenhower and Stevenson on the Democratic ticket would certainly defeat Eisenhower and Nixon on the Republican ticket . <P> <P> CHARLES E. STRACHAN , M.D. <P> <P> Burbank , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> I think that we the people are entitled to know from the Republican Party before the election just who will run the Government-and where the capital will be situated-Maryland , Georgia , Palm Springs , Denver , Gettysburg , Washington , D.C. , or the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda , Md . <P> <P> DOROTHY MASON East Lansing , Mich . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> How silly can some Republicans get ? They rival the A.D.A . and Harry Truman in their hatred of Nixon . I consider Nixon , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit . <P> <P> E. L. BAKER Bradford , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Anyone in his right mind should not even consider letting Ike decide who should be Vice President . I sincerely believe Mr. Nixon should be running the Government . <P> <P> W. J. HALL <P> Mobile , Ala . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> Practicing the virtues of a true Christian , together with the duties of a perfect gentleman and patriot , President Eisenhower 's tested leadership inspires confidence and trust . All those who toil for a peaceful world will wish him Godspeed in a second term of office . <P> <P> BARONNE DE FURSTENBERG Brussels <P> Joseph &; the Democrats <P> Sir : <P> You folks were nodding when you failed to scotch Representative Bob Poage 's crack about Joseph taking gold vessels from his brethren March 5 , which shows how ignorant of the Bible a Texas Democrat can be . Joseph took nothing from his brothers . On the contrary , he gave generous gifts to them . As for " gold vessels , " the only thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was not gold but silver . Joseph ordered it to be placed in the sack of his full brother , Benjamin , so he would have a pretext to keep him in Egypt . We all know that Harry Truman is rewriting history to suit the doctrines of the Democratic Party . Has Bob Poage undertaken the job of rewriting the Bible for the same purpose ? <P> <P> ALFRED OLSEN JR . Lawndale , Calif . <P> <P> Says Texas ' Poage : " Being from a silver-producing state in the West , Mr. Benson probably knows more about Joseph than I do . Possibly Joseph was a Free Silver Democrat . " - ED . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> Few Republicans or Democrats would be a match for Bible Reader Benson , who was too polite to correct Bob Poage . . . <P> <P> MRS . WALTER WHITE Rio Linda , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Not any of the Senators present seemed to be aware that the comparison between the Biblical Joseph and a truly great Democrat of the 19305 was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that Joseph the Provider , although planned in the 19203 in Germany , was finally written during the early 19405 in California , as a discreet tribute to F.D.R. and the New Deal TIME , Aug. 22.
