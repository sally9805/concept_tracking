a AM the mother of a nineteen-year-old boy . To me , he is handsome , gifted , understanding  --  my whole world . Yesterday I was told , " Mrs. B. , you 'd better forget you have a son . " I have to tell this , even though I 'm ashamed of it . Shame is something I 've learned to live with . It 's not that I 'm ashamed in the usual sense when I look at my boy . Much of the guilt rests upon me . You see , my son is a drug addict . It has taken me three years to learn to face that fact and live with it . If my story helps some other parent , perhaps the telling will help me to sleep at night . Buddy was a shy , sensitive boy when he was little . We lived in a quiet neighborhood and he did n't have many playmates . But he liked to read and hada lively imagination . As he grew a little older he showed signs of talent , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one period when he spent his time splashing water colors on every piece of paper he could find . His teacher even sent home a note saying he showed artistic ability . But what I really wanted him to learn was music . I 'd always regretted dropping my own musical training . And Buddy took to the piano . He had a natural ear and could pick out a tune before he ever had a lesson . We found a good teacher for him and he made rapid progress . I used to sit by the hour and listen to him practice . His father , too , had taken a few piano lessons when he was a boy . He and Buddy often tried duets together . It was n't till after his father 's death that my son began to change . Buddy was just beginning high school the year John 's plane crashed . I was of balance myself for a long time after that . I realize now that I leaned too much on my son . He was so much like his dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy seemed to understand perfectly all the loss and loneliness I felt . When I was missing John most he 'd stay up late at night and talk to me . For a long time he dropped his own friends . I tried not to notice when at last he began to chafe to get back to them . Finally necessity stepped in and we had to do something to support ourselves . Buddy offered to quit school and get a job , but I would n't hear of it . I used John 's insurance to open a small dress shop . After I started working I saw less of my son . He was sixteen and beginning to get his own ideas about how to spend his evenings . A boy called Ervin used to come by and pick him up . Ervin had a stripped-down hot-rod , and , to me , he seemed a little wild . I worried about Buddy riding with him , but I did n't say anything . I thought they were merely going through that first girl-crazy age . If only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade Buddy to spend more time at home with his studies . But he 'd always made good grades without half trying . It had been the same with the piano , except that he now seemed to have lost interest in playing . On the rare evenings he spent at home he was restless . He paced about the house , out onto the front porch and back again . He developed a habit of squirming about in his chair whenever he tried to relax . But he was still the same Buddy when we talked . I thought his moods were just adolescence . I had known mothers who refused to let their sons grow up . I was n't going to be one of those . Still I should have realized that my son was not normal . It was about that time that things started disappearing from the house . I remember the evening I came home and found the radio missing from the living room . Buddy was home early that night . He checked all the screens , trying to find how a burglar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tightly closed . These Were n't Any Ordinary Burglaries T HE same thing happened over and over again . John 's guns and camera , money from my purse , even a sewing machine , disappeared without a trace . Buddy suggested that someone must have a key to fit our door . I had the lock changed the next day . But not long after that we had an even bigger burglary . This time they took my fur coat and what was left of the wedding silver . Buddy discovered a hole in a back screen and a window open . I had the police come out and called the insurance company about the coat . It was a valuable one that John had given me . I did n't even vaguely suspect , then , that all of those things had been taken to buy heroin . I was equally blind to the other signs . I remember now the little squares of paper in which they sometimes fold the powder , the tiny pieces of cotton for filtering the stuff I occasionally found in Buddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buddy caught the flu the next winter . I was trying to get ready to go to the shop . I 'd fixed his breakfast , but he did n't come down when I called him . Finally I went upstairs , and found him sitting on the edge of his bed . He was flushed with fever , but trying to get into his clothes . " I 'm going to call a doctor , " I told hire . He protested , begged me not to , but I went ahead . When the doctor came , he told me Buddy was on the verge of pneumonia . " Keep him in bed for four or five days , " he advised me . I noticed the strange look in Buddy 's eyes as the doctor spoke . It was a frightened look . " A few days in bed are n't going to hurt you , " I assured him . He shouted back at me , " I 'm not going to stay In bed any four or five days ! " But he was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse . I could hear him moaning and retching in the bathroom . It was a terrifying sound . I rushed to his room as he was staggering back to bed , gaunt , unshaven , his face a pasty white . I ran to help him , but he shoved me aside . He looked at me almost as if he hated me . " I 'm going out , " he said . I thought he was delirious and I was firm with him . He was so weak he had to lie down , and I finally almost forced him to take some of the medicine the doctor had left . As he lay writhing on the bed , I knew I 'd never seen delirium like this before . Every muscle of his body seemed in torment . He gripped the head of the bed until his knuckles were white . He could n't lie still for a moment . He drew ( Continued from Page 21 ) " You 'll not be getting any more ' bad stuff , ' " I told him harshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see it finished right now . " As I heard my own words in that voice that was n't my own , I could n't stand to look at him any more . I turned and hurried from the room . All of the strength was gone out of me . I do n't know how many of my tears were tears of self-pity , but they were tears that I have since learned to dry . A few minutes later , when I went back to Buddy 's room , he was gone . It was an easy matter to climb out the window . The hours that followed were torture for me , as his own withdrawal symptoms must have been for him . A dozen times I picked up the phone to call the authorities  --  the police ? somebody ! But I could n't face the thought of my son being taken to jail . I did n't call . It was a bleak , foggy day , with weary gusts of wind . I could see Buddy , lying half dead in an alley somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself with worry , not knowing where to turn , whom to ask for help . I think it was then that I felt my first twinges of personal shame and guilt . All of Buddy 's life from babyhood on passed through my mind . Where had I failed ? What had I done to cause this ? It took Buddy himself to calm me . He walked in without a word , about nine o'clock that night . He still was haggard and unkempt , but otherwise he appeared almost normal . He obviously had found what he went for . " Well , I guess it 's out , is n't it , mother ? " he said , brushing past me . I could tell he resented what I had done to him  --  what I had made him go through . But once I knew he was safe I was more determined than ever to fight the thing that menaced him . I have a feeling now that the way I went about it was all wrong , but I still do n't know the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He tried to treat the whole issue lightly . " It 's just something that can happen , " he hedged . " I have n't used much stuff . A guy 'll just try these things along with everybody else , y ' know . I guess it was the cold I had that made it come down on me . That , and the bad ' H I shot . " ( He was giving me my introduction to what they call " straight talk , " the jargon of all drug addicts . ) " I never really had a habit , mother . " I decided to wait and see , but as the days passed , I knew he was using drugs . I found I knew the symptoms . The restlessness , the nervous mannerisms , which once passed without too much notice , took on new meaning . I could tell when he was about to leave the house , about to go out in search of his mysterious friends , his connection and dope ! I had n't given much thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addiction . I did n't know about the cost of heroin . But I 'm sure now that Buddy must have been involved in thefts and in the peddling of drugs , too , to keep up his habit . I do n't know whether it was defiance or whether it was just that he no longer needed to keep up a front , but he started staying out even later at night . He missed school half the time . He would n't eat his meals , and I could practically see him growing thinner . ( Cons ' ed on Page 79 ) ( Continued from Page 77 ) But after that first night he 'd look me straight in the eye and deny he was using drugs . I waited as long as I could before I called the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and asked for help . Even as I made that call I had a foreboding mental picture of squad cars screaming up to the house ; of my boy being hustled off to jail . But the Federal agent who came out had nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kindness and understanding . He would n't want me to use his real name , so I 'll call him Robert Maxwell . He was a quiet , unassuming little man , with the softest voice I 've ever heard . There was something about his bland gray eyes behind the rimless spectacles that made me feel that he knew what I was going to say before I could say it . Mr. Maxwell listened quietly as I told him what had happened to Buddy . Then he got up and paced about the room with short , deliberate strides . I noticed he was still holding his hat . I 'd been too preoccupied to take it from him . " I ca n't offer you the help I 'd like to , Mrs. B. " he said at last . " There are only two Federal hospitals in the whole country that are equipped to handle cases like this as they should be handled . They 're both overcrowded right now , and the nearest one is fifteen hundred miles away . Of course , we could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . But that 's a painful process , Mrs. B. , and it 's not likely to do him any permanent good . The most important thing is to make your son want to break the habit . Even that wo n't be enough . He 'll still need help . " Mr. Maxwell went on as if he were talking to himself , " Probably he 'll fight us at first . Suppose you tell him You 've been in touch with me , but that ? I 've promised to take no action if he 'll enter a private sanitarium . I 'll have to warn you that may do him no good . Many sanitariums that take these cases will sell you any kind of cure you can pay for-a fifty-dollar cure or a thousand-dollar cure , worth about the same . Ito all depends on the boy and how much of a burner ' - " He grinned at his own use of the " junkie " slang . " How much of a habit he has . " He was standing there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back door . Panic seized me . I jumped to my feet and tried to say something , but Mr. Maxwell just smiled reassuringly . Buddy was already halfway in the room . He stopped and stared at the Federal agent . For some unexplainable reason , I could n't tell him right then who our caller was . " This is my son , " I said awkwardly , turning to Mr. Maxwell . There must have been an appealing look in my eyes . He greeted Buddy gravely , noncommittally . At least , I noted with relief , Buddy was looking fairly normal . He had shaved that morning-something he 'd often failed to do of late-and he was wearing a passably clean shirt . " Mr. Maxwell is here on- uhbusiness , Buddy , " I said unnecessarily . The narcotics agent was making casual conversation . Then , smiling slightly at my anxiety , he said , " I 'll be in touch with you , Mrs. B , " and he was gone . Buddy was plainly curious . I did n't often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen him somewhere , mother , " he said pointedly . " Something about the shop , " I answered , and became very busy in the kitchen . I needed time to organize my thoughts before I faced up to this crisis . That night I told Buddy . He was in the living room , for the first time in weeks picking out a tune at the piano when I walked in . " Mr. Maxwell is a Federal agent , " I announced flatly . The caught look which crossed his face lasted only for an instant . Then be began to protest . It was the same old story-that he was n't using drugs any more . He told it with such sincerity I might have believed him if I had n't begun to learn that deceit is as natural as breathing to a dope addict . I let him go through his routine without stopping him . Then I repeated the choice the narcotics agent had given him-treatment at a sanitarium or jail . He was silent for a moment as he ran a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crooked smile curled one corner of his mouth . " I might have known you 'd turn me in , mother . " It was as if he had thrown up a wa between us . I wanted to take his han and tell him ; make him understand that it was all for him . But there was no way of getting past his bitterness . " I guess Mr. Maxwell did n't explain , " he went on in a light , dry voice , " that he has to catch me with some stuff on me before he can lock me up . " He gave me the twisted smile again as he walked out of the house . Buddy did n't come home that night . And 1 heard nothing from him the next day . Desperate , I was at the point of calling Mr. Maxwell again , when I learned that the sanitarium question had been settled for us . The emergency hospital telephoned . Buddy had been in an accident . I 'm not sure even now that I know the full story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know , a Sid Erskine . I 've since learned he 's a dope pusher . It happened in the slum district of the city - a collision at an intersection . " I guess I gave you a bad time , mother , " he said gravely one day . " That junk is terrible stuff . " My heart was singing as I left the hospital . I almost quit worrying after that about the mysterious telephone calla I 'd been getting for Buddy since his accident . A man who would n't give his name had been trying to find out where he was . Once Buddy was able to sit up , I sometimes reduced my visits to one a day . I had neglected the shop for so long that it needed a lot of attention . For some reason it never occurred to me that anything could happen to my son while he was in the hospital . But late one night the telephone jarred me awake . It was Buddy . " Mother , I 've got to have fifty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I slipped out of the hospital , and I 've got to raise some money . " It took me a little while to understand . Hearing his voice on the telephone startled me . At last he managed to explain that the money was for a dope peddler-one who 'd come to visit him . Anger and consternation were my first reactions . " Buddy , you 've got to go back to the hospital ! Where are you now ? " He would n't tell me unless I promised to bring the money . I could sense that he was desperate . " This guy 's no punk , mother ; he means business ! " he wailed , actually weeping over the phone . I agreed to drive downtown and meet him at the street address he gave rne . It was n't a street where a woman alone could safely stop her car . It must have been about two A.M. The traffic lights had stopped changing . They blinked at me with evil yellow eyes between the rows of dirty brick buildings . Several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I searched for the number Buddy had given me . It was the number of a gray , nameless building with the windows painted over . I drew to the curb and turned off the headlights as Buddy had asked . The street appeared deserted . A block away , a feeble overhead light glimmered ineffectually against the darkness . Somewhere in the distance I could hear the grinding of a trolley , the distant clang of the sleepless city . Then a shuffling step , and a dark figure moved around the corner of the building . For an endless time , the man stood there , immobile , watching me . Then slowly he came toward the car . In near panic , I reached for the ignition switch . The inexorable steps advancing toward me made a hollow sound on the sidewalk . As the man came abreast of the car , they stopped . I gripped the steering wheel , afraid to move , as he stood looking at me , his face shadowed beneath his turned-down hat . When he moved forward again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Instead , his steps quickened and he came around to my side of the car . He did n't lean down to the window , but stood back , still too far for me to make out his face clearly . " Didja bring the fifty ? " he asked in a muffled voice . Hearing him speak , at least that much like a human being , must have brought me out of my frightened paralysis . " Where 's Buddy ? What have you done to my son ? " I gasped . " He 's round the corner . He told me you 'd have the fifty . " " I want my son here in the car with me before I give any money to any- 80 body , " I told him . Suddenly I was n't afraid of the dark , hulking figure , the muffled voice that sounded somehow unsure . The man hesitated for a moment , then slowly turned away . He disappeared again around the corner of the building . I did n't know what to do . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting the car and trying to follow him . Then two figures came out of the shadows , and I could glimpse the white bandages around Buddy 's throat . He walked to the car window . " Thanks for coming , mother . " " Payyour debt , " I said as harshly as I could , thrusting two twenties and a ten into his hand . I did n't know , until he turned to the dope peddler , how far Buddy had gone to get this jolt of heroin . " Gim me the pipe , " he whispered . The man handed him something which caught the light , at the same time taking the wadded bills . Buddy stood working with the bandages at his throat and I saw what the peddler had given him . It was the platinum inner portion of the trachea tube . Without that section of tube , hich he could take out and clean to eep his throat clear , Buddy might have choked to death in the street . Still he was so desperate for dope that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first experience with the heartless dealings of a heroin pusher . Buddy and I did n't talk much as we drove away from that rendezvous . As I made a turn , he asked if I was going to take him back to the hospital . " Not tonight , " I said . A plan was beginning to take shape in my mind . " How much heroin did you get for that fifty dollars ? " He hesitated . " Do n't worry , I 'm not going to take it away from you . " That was my plan , only half formed at that moment . I would take him home and try to regain his confidence , stop building up his resentment against me . That night had taught me what a powerful enemy I had to fight . I recalled Mr. Maxwell 's words : " The most important thing is to make your son want to quit . " Somehow I had to get close to Buddy again  --  find out what his thoughts were , what it was besides the physical habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay awake most of that night . The next morning I called the hospital and his doctor agreed to let him stay at home as long as he made a daily visit . Buddy was still weak from his injury and he slept until nearly noon . When I heard him moving around , I took his breakfast up to him . I tried to act as if nothing had happened . He kept watching me out of the corner of his eye , as if he expected something . Finally he broke the silence himself . " Sorry about the fifty dollars , mother . I know that 's quite a lot of money . " I could n't look at him just then . " It 's all right , Buddy , " I said . " I know you have to have the stuff until we can get you a real cure . " He was silent , looking at me . " How much did you get from that peddler ? " He waited a long moment , but this time he answered . " A spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as you can , " I told him , and left the room . I did n't want to tell him all at once what I contemplated , but I had made a start January 26 , 1952 Nothing unusual happened for the next three days . I took Buddy to the hospital for his dressings every morning . He was much like himself , though I knew he must he using some heroin every day . I simply forgot about the shop and stayed with him . On the fourth day he seemed nervous . He could n't be still . When he tried to sit down , he tossed himself about in the fidgety manner I had seen before . Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead and he was ghastly pale . I knew what was wrong , but I waited . That evening he came to the door of the kitchen where I was working . He looked pitiable . " Mother , " he gasped , " I 've got to have some more stuff ! " It may seem strange , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to trust me again . He was depending on me . " Do you know where you can make a connection ? " I asked him as calmly as I could . Then I told him the conditions I had carefully planned . I would go with him . All the heroin he bought had to be turned over to me . He had to promise not to " shoot " any before we got back home . And I was going to watch him inject the stuff . " I want to see everything you go through , " I said . " I do n't want you ever to be able to fool me again . " For just a moment there was some of the old bitterness in his look . I was forcing him . " All right , mother , " he said . " All right . I 've got to have a jolt . " He seemed to feel better as soon as we started . He began to see the ludicrousness of the situation . " I guess you 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  marihuana smoker . " I managed to laugh a little with him . was beginning to understand how much of his habit was mental . It seemed to do him good merely to know he was going to have his drug . That first trip with Buddy into the junk district is something I 'll always remember with a shudder . It was growing dark when we stopped the car in a cluttered alley . Tall gray tenement buildings  --  the kind with rickety outside stairways  --  rose on either side . Buddy was getting jittery again . " Let me go in alone , " he begged . " I promise I 'll come right back . " ( Continued from Page 81 ) son . After the tube was removed from his throat and he was almost well again , I told him he could ask his friends to the house whenever he wanted to . I knew what I was proposing . All of his old school friends had dropped him . He knew only heroin users . They used to come sometimes ? thin pale youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markedly different from other adolescents  --  quieter , perhaps . They used to sit in the living room , listening to the record player , talking in low voices . Now and then , I 'd hear a laugh . I knew there was only one thing they talked about ? heroin . I stayed out of their way at first . But I did n't want even that barrier between myself and my son . I began to find excuses to walk in on them . Always there was that sudden silence when I appeared  --  a sentence left hanging in midair . But Buddy did n't seem to mind . And his friends finally came to realize that I knew all about them . After a time they would even talk to me about " junk . " They knew what heroin was doing to them and they had every intention of quitting sometime . For a while I had a notion I could reform them all . I was still to learn that making resolutions is almost second nature to a heroin user . Any one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he 's had a jolt and has another cap in his pocket . I found I 'd placed a new burden on my conscience by letting Buddy bring his friends home . I wondered if their parents knew what they were doing . I had met the mother of one boy , and eventually I forced myself to call on her . It was a fruitless gesture . She assumed I was just making casual conversation when I mentioned dope and juvenile addiction . Yes , she 'd read about that in the papers too . I suddenly realized that even if I told her outright , I could n't convince her that her son was an addict . No , she would have to find out for herself . As for Buddy , I was sure he was using less heroin than before . I began to trust him to make his own buys . I let him take the car , and he always came home to let me dole out his supply . Sometimes he even talked about taking a cure . I started calling private physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . The answer was always the same : institutional treatment . One psychiatrist , who had been working with hypnotism , thought he might be able to help . After much persuasion , Buddy agreed to see him , but all he would say when he came home was , " I do n't want to be a guinea pig . " Without Buddy 's knowing , I had another talk with Mr. Maxwell , the Federal agent . He promised to try to get Buddy into the Government hospital at Fort Worth . Meanwhile I bought every book I could find which dealt with drug addiction . Buddy read them avidly and we discussed them together . I wanted him to learn to think of drugs objectively . as something separate from himself . Maybe the books did some good , temporarily . But once the bandages came off his throat and he was really well again , I knew I could n't keep him cooped up in the house . I had hoped he 'd get interested in a girl , but he was n't that normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out . Then came the night I had tried not to think about  --  the night he did n't come home . I suppose I was really braced for it . I was n't surprised . I just felt beaten and defeated as the long dark hours went by . Buddy was gone for two days . He 's never told me where he spent that time . I 'm not sure that I want to know . On the third night I heard his step at the back door and met him as he came through the kitchen . I 'm sure he had n't washed or shaved since leaving home . His clothes were soiled and wrinkled , as if he 'd slept in them , and he would n't look at me . He went past me up to his room . For an hour I clattered about the kitchen , trying to compose my thoughts . Finally I went up to him . He had thrown himself across the bed , still clothed . He lay on his back in a deep , unnatural sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expression that sent cold chills through me . I cried out , shaking him violently , " Buddy , wake up ! I ca n't stand it ! " He opened his eyes heavily and grinned weakly at me . The wanton , degenerate look was gone . I was a little hysterical , I guess . I did n't know whether to laugh or cry . " What 's the matter , mother ? " he asked . " Your face , the expression abou your mouth ! There was something ev about it ! I could n't bear to look at you ! " He did n't say anything for a moment ; just pulled himself up on the edge of the bed and sat hunched over with his face in his hands . " Mother , " he said , " junk is evil . Everything it touches , it makes evil . " Yea , he knew what was happening to him . But he seemed to draw some kind of satisfaction from confession . " I should have been in the ' joint ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half shamefaced , half joking . " The jams I 've been in , the things I 've stolen , just to get a jolt . " We had never discussed the things he 'd taken from his own home , though I had long since guessed the whole story . Now he wanted to talk about it . " It 's one thing to steal , " he said morosely , " but I had to pick on my own mother . The stuff drives you crazy , that 's what it does . " There was always that out , that excuse . And there was no way of stopping him . In the days that , followed , I began to see my carefully thought-out plan as a fallacious dream . Why should I have thought that he and I alone could be strong enough ? I knew , from my reading on the subject of drug addiction , that Buddy was increasing his dosage . He had to have more heroin all the time in order to avert that terrible sickness . Usually I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't stand to go to bed at night unless he knew there was a jolt waiting for him the next morning . He told me of getting up once in the night , catching a train across town to make a connection . Somehow a mental picture of that ride still haunts me , though I was n't there to see it . A sick " hype , " my own boy , hunched over in a back seat of the electric train , hoping no one would see im , aching in every bone of his body , owning and straining at every stop , hanging on somehow until he could find a peddler . Buddy wryly admitted one day , " I 'm getting quite a burner ' ( habit ) , mother . I 'm getting to be a pig . " There was only one thing for me to do . Federal Agent Maxwell came out promptly when I called him . He asked to see Buddy alone , and they were together for an hour or more . When it was over , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your boy will be picked up one of these nights if he does n't turn himself in , " he told me . " The city squad has an eye on him . He 's been seen with the wrong people . Sooner or later they 're bound to get him or " ? he paused with a quiet smile ? " have to take him in myself . " I tried to pass that warning on to Buddy . " I know all that , " he answered irritably . " Maxwell told me I should turn myself in with half a cap of ' H ' in my possession . Well , I had none on me , see ? Maybe if I had , he 'd have locked me up for you . " He slammed out of the house and did n't come back . But he saved Mr. Maxwell the trouble of arresting him . The next I heard from Buddy was a call that night from the police . He 'd been found , wrapped in a piece of canvas , unconscious in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently abandoned by companions . The waiting was endless before they would let me into the jail ward to see him . He was lying so gray-faced and still on the white cot that for one terrible instant I could think only of death . He opened his eyes when I spoke to him . His voice was a moan as he turned and crushed his face into the thin jail pillow . " I know what those guys did to me , mother . They thought I 'd conked off , and they just dumped me . Did n't want a stiff on their hands . " He breathed heavily against the pillow . " I knew they were dumping me . I knew for just a minute in the back of the truck . But I could n't move , and I blacked outagain . " Buddy had sunk so low that there was nowhere else for him to go . Mr. Maxwell booked him in court for commitment to the hospital at Fort Worth . They would n't let me see him after that . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , no peddler could get to him . But he had to go through those first awful days of withdrawal in the county jail , before they could take him across the country to the hospital . Frantically , I called the jail doctor . " They never die , Mrs. B. , " he said calmly . At last I was told Buddy was on his way to Fort Worth . He did n't write to me for the first two weeks . Later he explained he 'd been too sick to write . When his letters did begin to come , I felt that I could live again . He told me how much better he was feeling . He begged forgiveness all over again for the things he had done to me . He wrote about the hospital , the recreation program , the reading he was doing . He even found a piano in the hospital auditorium , and finally got permission to practice . For weeks his letters were mostly about his music . Later he began to make plans . He wrote about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was home again . He never failed to mention how well he was . " I 'm on a health kick , " he joked . He even urged me to take better care of myself . That was months ago . Buddy came home the other day . I had made big plans for his homecoming ? sent him a plane ticket , some new clothes and luggage . But he did n't arrive on schedule . 1 finally gave up waiting at the airport . Another plane finally brought him , about eight hours late . He had stopped over at El Paso . And when he walked into the house he was " loaded " ? just as I had seen him so many times before It was Mr. Maxwell who told me in his quiet , final way , " I know parents are n't built this way , Mrs. B. , but you 'd better forget you have a son . "
