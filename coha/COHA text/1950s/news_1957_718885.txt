txt CARPENTER CHIEF INVOKES THE 5TH Hutcheson and 2 Aides Balk ) Inquiry Into Alleged Profits on Indiana Land Deals By The Associated Press . WASHINGTON , June 10 ? Maurice A. Hutcheson. president of the Carpenters Union , resorted today to the Fifth Amendment in the face of evidence linking him to fast , big profits in an Indiana highway scandal . Two other top officials of the union did the same . Mr. Hutcheson , who is 60 years old , is a vice president and member of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations . He said it might incriminate him to answer questions about what Senator Albert Gore , Democrat of Tennessee , called " this conspiracy against the Federal and state governments . " A Senate Public Works subcommittee on which Mr. Gore is chairman , brought out testimony and documents indicating Mr. Hutcheson was in on a five-way split of some $80,000 in profits on right-of-way land sales . Denies Misuse of Funds At one point in his tcstimonr Mr. Hutcheson said : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherhood1 funds for anything except broth- ; erhood business since I have ) been in office . " The subcommittee has uncovered no indication that union ) 1 money figured in the highway scandals . Even so , Mr. Hutcheson may : be in trouble with the ethical code and high command of the . A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . He was one of those who sat in judgment when the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . Executive Council voted unanimously to oust Dave Beck , teamsters ' president , from its rolls . That was after another Senate committee had accused Mr. Beck of misusing some $370,000 of union funds and Mr. Beck , too , took the Fifth Amendment . George Meany , A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . president , said in a statement : " I will bring this matter to the attention of the Executive Council at the earliest opportunity . " The next scheduled meeting of the council is set for August . Aides Under Investigation The Public Works subcommit-i tee also was investigating Frank M. Chapman , general treasurer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Blaieed second vice president ; Virgil W. ( Red ) Smith , former chairman 1 of the Indiana . State Highway Department , and Harry C. Dog-I gett , former chief land buyer ; ' for the department . All four have invoked the Fifth Amendment - - Mr. Chap- ' man and Mr. Blaier today , Mr.1 Smith and Mr. Doggett last ; month . Mr. Smith and Mr. Dog- ; gett are under indictment in connection with right-of-way : acquisition for an expressway.1 What the subcommittee was ' exploring was the buying of land for rights-of-way for a traffic cloverleaf at Gary for the tri-state superhighway and a bypass at Richmond . Federal funds to help states build highways are involved . " Mr. Hutcheson , " Mr. Gore asked , " when did you first discuss and enter into this con --  -- - // spiracy with Virgil Smith ? " The union president invoked the Fifth Amendment  --  one of thirty-seven times . Mr. Hutcheson and Mr. Smith ; come from the small town oft Milan , Ind . Into the record went documents indicating Mr. Chapman had picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , then turned around and sold them to the state about a mont:t Ilter for $101,416.29  --  a profit of some $78,516 or upward of 400 per cent . There was evidence also that this money , plus $19,000 from a right-of-way sale by Mr. Blaier for the Richmond bypass , went into a special account Mr. Chapman had set up in the Indiana National Bank in Indianapolis . Henry A. Pfarrer , the bank cashier , identified photocopies of checks showing that out of this account $15,500 was distributed to Mr. Hutcheson , $26 , - 968 to Mr. Chapman , $25,432.90 to M. Blaier , $15,800 to Mr. Doggett and $15,500 to Mr. Smith . In taking refuge in the Fifth Amendment , Mr. Hutcheson even refused for a while to say who was the present Governor of Indiana . That brought a blast from Mr. Gore and finally an answer . The carpenters ' president used the Fifth Amendment again when asked how he voted on Mr. Beck 's ouster from the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . Executive Council , declaring a reply might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hearing . He had the same answer when asked whether it was true that the council had rules that any of its members , " which includes you , " who hide under the Fifth should be ousted from the council . The A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . Lode of ethics declares that any union official who takes the Fifth Amendment on matters of corruption is not entitled to continue in his position . To a question whether he believed in this policy statement , Mr. Hutcheson replied in a low voice . " Not completely . " " It mixes the personal beliefs of an individual with his duties to an organization , " he added . Mr. Blaier followed the Fifth Amendment pattern on questions about whether he bought 33.02 acres of land in Wayne County , Ind. , from Donald and Norma G , Arthur for $16,500 , then sold 1.59 acres of it to the Highway Department , for $19 , - 000 , retaining the rest . That would have represented a net profit of $2,500 , plus the value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senator John A. Carroll , Democrat of Colorado , told Mr Hutcheson , vv  --  lo succeeded his father , the late William ( Big Bill ) Hutcheson as head of the carpenters union in 1953 : " You are a national leader of the labor movement . This whole procedure . today will come as a great shock to your 850,000 members and their families . " The Senator asked if the witness had any comment to volunteer . It was then that Mr. Hutcheson said he had not used union funds for anything except union business . The evidence gathered by the committee , Carroll suggested , should be submitted to a Federal grand jury . " From my understanding , " said Filo M. Sedillo , subcommittee counsel , " Mr. Hutcheson is not even under suspicion in the State of Indiana . He has not been under investigation . "
