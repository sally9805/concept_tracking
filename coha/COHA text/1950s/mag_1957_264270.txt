Some of the best-known contemporary U.S. composers-Aaron Copland , Walter Piston , Roy Harris , Marc Blitzstein , Virgil Thomson-are tied to a woman 's apron strings . The woman : their sometime teacher , Nadia Boulanger , for years head of the American Conservatory of Music at Fontainebleau , first woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra ( as a guest in 1938 ) , and the world 's most renowned teacher of composition . <P> Her alumni fondly recall the ways of the " tender tyrant " : she had her students carrying packages for her and driving her car , called them in the middle of the night to do copying work for her . In Teacher Boulanger , they found not only a diamond-edged musical intelligence but a sinewy will that forced them to hew rigidly to the demands of their talents . The distinguished Boulanger alumni-they call themselves the " Boulangerie " - were gathered in all parts of the world last week to celebrate her 70 birthday . At the split-level chalet of Conductor Igor Markevitch , in the Swiss Alps near Montreux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever in a black evening gown , held court before such famous ex-pupils as Pianist Clara Haskil , Cellist Pierre Fournier , Composer Darius Milhaud . <P> While the Markevitch children presented Nadia with a $3,000 diamond bought by members of the Boulangerie the world over , the guests launched into an exuberant chorus composed for the occasion by Francis Poulenc . " Vive Nadia , the dear Nadia Boulanger , the very dear Nadia , Al-le-lu-jah ! " Later , musicians performed another birthday tribute : a cantata by Composer Jean Franaix for five strings , five winds and six-handed piano . Over the bubbly , breakneck music ex-pupils chanted their praise of Nadia . One , made up to look like President Ren Coty of France , paid the Fourth Republic 's tribute ; another , costumed like a priest , intoned , " St. Nadia , protect us , " and two more singers , representing Sebastian ( Bach ) and Igor ( Stravinsky ) , chanted : " Long live peaceful coexistence ! " <P> Energetic as ever at 70 , Nadia Boulanger has nevertheless decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately in her big , crowded Paris apartment . Says an admirer : " She still knows more about music than all the great composers and performers . " What precisely is it that she knows ? The woman who gave up her own early attempts at composition as " useless music " has not tried to shape a special musical style , stands first of all for intellect and discipline . In an age given to sprawling , undisciplined " self-expression , " this has been a much needed corrective . Critics of Teacher Boulanger nonetheless wonder what the work of many contemporary composers might have sounded like without the apron strings of her cool , brainy , French-intellectual influence . But , says Nadia Boulanger sternly : " Great art likes chains . The greatest artists have created art within bounds . Or else they have created their own chains . "
