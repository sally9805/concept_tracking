txt Under the shadow of the Cornrounist invasion of Laos and the growing threat to Thailand , President Eisenhower sent to Congress his foreign-aid estimate of $5,800,000,000 with a message that emphasized the danger to world peace rather than the economies he was making in the earlier Truman proposals . The administration used a procedure of unprecedented gravity in presenting the revised proem which is ** below what Mr. Truman asked last January . While four members of the top Eisenhower team spoke in succession before a joint session of the Senate and House Foreign Relations Committees , President Eisenhower sent a special message to Congress requesting the sum . The speakers before the joint committees were John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , Harold E. Stassen , Mutual Security Director , Charles E. Wilson , Secretary of Defense , and George M. Humphrey , Secretary of Treasury . Last-Minute Revision There was evidence of lastifiinute revision of the figures due to the Laos invasion , and Mr. Stassen told the press that officials had worked on estimates up to the last minute . More than 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular 400 million dollars go for Indo - China defenses to French forces or to those of the associated states of Cambodia , Laos , and Viet Nam . This means that about 40 per cent of the French cost of the Indo-China war will be covered by United States contributions in various forms . All through the message , of President Eisenhower and his four officials these points were emphasized , regarding the new " economy-package " aid program : 1 . The new $5,800,000,000 total is a rock-bottom minimum : it does not contain any " water " and Congress will cut it at its peril . ? 2 . The mood to Moscow is one of declining optimism in contrast to that of a month or so ago . " The blunt , sober truth is , " wrote President Eisenhower , " that we can not afford to relax our de fenses until we have seen clear , unmistakable evidence of genuinely peaceful purposes on the part of the Soviet Union . " Shock Cushioned 3 . The economic shock to European allies of reduced aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weapons for the common defense  --  notably purchase of jet fighters from Britain and France , each of which receives a contract of some 100 million dollars for this one purpose . 4 . Even more dramatic as an innovation is the introduction of a new figure of 250 million dollars for what Mr. Stassen calls " mutual special weapons planning . " There is some mystery over this account . Under the law guarding A-bombs , atomic weapons can not be physically transported abroad without congressional approval . But the new item seems to permit training in special countries , under presidential discretion , in the use of tactical atomic weapons , even if the warhead is not transmitted . 5 . Finally , the program is presented in a bipartisan manner , with praise for past accomplishments of foreign aid and a minimum of what might have been political emphasis on the big cut made in the earlier Truman recommendation . Indeed , with Mr. Wilson referring to " two hot wars now going on " in the Pacific , observers gathered that there is no assurance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have erred , " said Mr. Dulles , " we have erred on the side of asking for too little rather than for two much . " Breakdown of Figures The most specific breakdown of the new figures was offered by Mr. Stassen , who will appear as witness at committees starting May 6 to elaborate the initial presentation . As he outlined the program , it stands roughly as follows : Total $5,828,000,000 , including , $4,000,000,000 for mutual defense material and training . $2,530,000,000 for Europe . $1,000,000,000 for Far East . , $475,000,000 for Near East . $20,000,000 for Latin America . $1,000,000,000 for " mutual defense financing , " including , $400,000,000 for procurement of equipment of France and associated states ( Indo-China ) . $100,000,000 in France for offshore equipment . $100,000,000 in Britain for offshore equipment . $100,000,000 in Britain to finance exports of United States wheat , cotton and lard to United Kingdom . $250,000,000 for " mutual security weapons planning . " $600,000,000 for nonmilitary items , including $315,000,000 for economic aid directed toward development ( includes $30,000,000 for Arab refugees ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations and other international organizations . Mr. Stassen did not break these figures down in a table and it was necessary to excerpt them from the body of his formal speech . Careful Deliberation President Eisenhower told Congress that the new mutual security program of 1954 " has been developed by the new administration after the most careful study and deliberation . " He cited five main conclusions from these studies which summarized were : ( 1 ) That the problem will continue " for many years " ; ( 2 ) That " we must avoid so rapid a military build-up that we seriously dislocate our economies " ; ( 3 ) " We must help the free nations to help themselves " ; ( 4 ) " It is necessary to do more in the Far East " ; ( 5 ) A " steady military build-up " is the proper procedure , since nobody can tell what year will offer maximum military danger .
