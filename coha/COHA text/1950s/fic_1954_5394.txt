In this warm and fanciful story of a Connecticut farmer , Marion Zimmer Bradley has caught some of the glory that is man 's love for man  --  no matter who he is nor whence he 's from . By heck , you 'll like little Matt. year of the big thaw by ... Marion Zimmer Bradley Mr. Emmett did his duty by the visitor from another world  --  never doubting the right of it . You say that Matthew is your own son , Mr. Emmett ? Yes , Rev'rend Doane , and a better boy never stepped , if I do say it as should n't . I 've trusted him to drive team for me since he was eleven , and you ca n't say more than that for a farm boy . Way back when he was a little shaver so high , when the war came on , he was bounden he was going to sail with this Admiral Farragut . You know boys that age  --  like runaway colts . I could n't see no good in his being cabin boy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he 'd wanted to sail out on a whaling ship , I ' low I 'd have let him go . But Marthy  --  that 's the boy 's Ma  --  took on so that Matt stayed home . Yes , he 's a good boy and a good son . We 'll miss him a powerful lot if he gets this scholarship thing . But I ' low it 'll be good for the boy to get some learnin ' besides what he gets in the school here . It 's right kind of you , Rev'rend , to look over this application thing for me . Well , if he is your own son , Mr. Emmett , why did you write ' birthplace unknown ' on the line here ? Rev'rend Doane , I 'm glad you asked me that question . I 've been turnin ' it over in my mind and I 've jest about come to the conclusion it would n't be nohow fair to hold it back . I did n't lie when I said Matt was my son , because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not his Pa and Marthy ai n't his Ma , so could be I stretched the truth jest a mite . Rev'rend Doane , it 's a tarnal funny yarn but I 'll walk into the meetin ' house and swear to it on a stack o'Bibles as thick as a cord of wood . You know I 've been farming the old Corning place these past seven year ? It 's good flat Connecticut bottom-land , but it is n't like our land up in Hampshire where I was born and raised . My Pa called it the Hampshire Grants and all that was King 's land when his Pa came in there and started farming at the foot of Scuttock Mountain . That 's Injun for fires , folks say , because the Injuns used to build fires up there in the spring for some of their heathen doodads . Anyhow , up there in the mountains we see a tarnal power of quare things . You call to mind the year we had the big thaw , about twelve years before the war ? You mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down most to York . And at Fort Orange , the place they call Albany now , the Hudson froze right over , so they say . But those York folks do a sight of exaggerating , I 'm told . Anyhow , when the ice went out there was an almighty good thaw all over , and when the snow run off Scuttock mountain there was a good-sized hunk of farmland in our valley went under water . The crick on my farm flowed over the bank and there was a foot of water in the cowshed , and down in the swimmin ' hole in the back pasture was n't nothing but a big gully fifty foot and more across , rushing through the pasture , deep as a lake and brown as the old cow . You know freshet-floods ? Full up with sticks and stones and old dead trees and somebody 's old shed floatin ' down the middle . And I swear to goodness , Parson , that stream was running along so fast I saw four-inch cobblestones floating and bumping along . I tied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white mare ; you mind she went lame last year and I had to shoot her , but she was just a young mare then and skittish as all get-out  --  but she was a good little mare . Anyhow , I tied the whole kit and caboodle of them in the woodshed up behind the house , where they 'd be dry , then I started to get the milkpail . Right then I heard the gosh-awfullest screech I ever heard in my life . Sounded like thunder and a freshet and a forest-fire all at once . I dropped the milkpail as I heard Marthy scream inside the house , and I run outside . Marthy was already there in the yard and she points up in the sky and yelled , " Look up yander ! " We stood looking up at the sky over Shattuck mountain where there was a great big  --  shoot now , I d'no as I can call its name but it was like a trail of fire in the sky , and it was makin ' the dangdest racket you ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth-of-July skyrockets , but it was big as a house . Marthy was screaming and she grabbed me and hollered , " Hez ! Hez , what in tunket is it ? " And when Marthy cusses like that , Rev'rend , she do n't know what she 's saying , she 's so scared . I was plumb scared myself . I heard Liza  --  that 's our young-un , Liza Grace , that got married to the Taylor boy . I heard her crying on the stoop , and she came flying out with her pinny all black and hollered to Marthy that the pea soup was burning . Marthy let out another screech and ran for the house . That 's a woman for you . So I quietened Liza down some and I went in and told Marthy it were n't no more than one of them shooting stars . Then I went and did the milking . But you know , while we were sitting down to supper there came the most awful grinding , screeching , pounding crash I ever heard . Sounded if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if somethin ' had hit it . Marthy jumped a mile and I never saw such a look on her face . " Hez , what was that ? " she asked . " Shoot , now , nothing but the freshet , " I told her . But she kept on about it . " You reckon that shooting star fell in our back pasture , Hez ? " " Well , now , I do n't ' low it did nothing like that , " I told her . But she was jittery as an old hen and it were n't like her nohow . She said it sounded like trouble and I finally quietened her down by saying I 'd saddle Kate up and go have a look . I kind of thought , though I did n't tell Marthy , that somebody 's house had floated away in the freshet and run aground in our back pasture . So I saddled up Kate and told Marthy to get some hot rum ready in case there was some poor soul run aground back there . And I rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphill because the top of the pasture is on high ground , and it sloped down to the crick on the other side of the rise . Well , I reached the top of the hill and looked down . The crick were a regular river now , rushing along like Niagary . On the other side of it was a stand of timber , then the slope of Shattuck mountain . And I saw right away the long streak where all the timber had been cut out in a big scoop with roots standing up in the air and a big slide of rocks down to the water . It was still raining a mite and the ground was sloshy and squanchy under foot . Kate scrunched her hooves and got real balky , not likin ' it a bit . When we got to the top of the pasture she started to whine and whicker and stamp , and no matter how loud I whoa-ed she kept on a-stamping and I was plumb scared she 'd pitch me off in the mud . Then I started to smell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ask me how anything could burn in all that water , because I do n't know . When we came up on the rise I saw the contraption . Rev'rend , it was the most tarnal crazy contraption I ever saw in my life . It was bigger nor my cowshed and it was long and thin and as shiny as Marthy 's old pewter pitcher her Ma brought from England . It had a pair of red rods sticking out behind and a crazy globe fitted up where the top ought to be . It was stuck in the mud , turned halfway over on the little slide of roots and rocks , and I could see what had happened , all right . The thing must have been  --  now , Rev'rend , you can say what you like but that thing must have flew across Shattuck and landed on the slope in the trees , then turned over and slid down the hill . That must have been the crash we heard . The rods were n't just red , they were red-hot . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of the infernal contraption there was a door , and it hung all to-other as if every hinge on it had been wrenched halfway off . As I pushed old Kate alongside it I heared somebody hollering alongside the contraption . I did n't nohow get the words but it must have been for help , because I looked down and there was a man a-flopping along in the water . He was a big fellow and he was n't swimming , just thrashin ' and hollering . So I pulled off my coat and boots and hove in after him . The stream was running fast but he was near the edge and I managed to catch on to an old tree-root and hang on , keeping his head out of the water till I got my feet aground . Then I hauled him onto the bank . Up above me Kate was still whinnying and raising Ned and I shouted at her as I bent over the man . Wal , Rev'rend , he sure did give me a surprise  --  were n't no proper man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of red clothes , real shiny and sort of stretchy and not wet from the water , like you 'd expect , but dry and it felt like that silk and India-rubber stuff mixed together . And it was such a bright red that at first I did n't see the blood on it . When I did I knew he were a goner . His chest were all stove in , smashed to pieces . One of the old tree-roots must have jabbed him as the current flung him down . I thought he were dead already , but then he opened up his eyes . A funny color they were , greeny yellow . And I swear , Rev'rend , when he opened them eyes I felt he was readin ' my mind . I thought maybe he might be one of them circus fellers in their flying contraptions that hang at the bottom of a balloon . He spoke to me in English , kind of choky and stiff , not like Joe the Portygee sailor or like those tarnal dumb Frenchies up Canady way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby  --  in ship . Get  --  baby ... " He tried to say more but his eyes went shut and he moaned hard . I yelped , " Godamighty ! " ' Scuse me , Rev'rend , but I was so blame upset that 's just what I did say , " Godamighty , man , you mean there 's a baby in that there dingfol contraption ? " He just moaned so after spreadin ' my coat around the man a little bit I just plunged in that there river again . Rev'rend , I heard tell once about some tomfool idiot going over Niagary in a barrel , and I tell you it was like that when I tried crossin ' that freshet to reach the contraption . I went under and down , and was whacked by floating sticks and whirled around in the freshet . But somehow , I d'no how except by the pure grace of God , I got across that raging torrent and clumb up to where the crazy dingfol machine was sitting . Ship , he 'd called it . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon kind of thing . It was a real scarey lookin ' thing but I clumb up to the little door and hauled myself inside it . And , sure enough , there was other people in the cabin , only they was all dead . There was a lady and a man and some kind of an animal looked like a bobcat only smaller , with a funny-shaped rooster-comb thing on its head . They all  --  even the cat-thing  --  was wearing those shiny , stretchy clo'es . And they all was so battered and smashed I did n't even bother to hunt for their heartbeats . I could see by a look they was dead as a doornail . Then I heard a funny little whimper , like a kitten , and in a funny , rubber-cushioned thing there 's a little boy baby , looked about six months old . He was howling lusty enough , and when I lifted him out of the cradle kind of thing , I saw why . That boy baby , he was wet , and his little arm was twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down awful hard , but that rubber hammock was so soft and cushiony all it did to him was jolt him good . I looked around but I could n't find anything to wrap him in . And the baby did n't have a stitch on him except a sort of spongy paper diaper , wet as sin . So I finally lifted up the lady , who had a long cape thing around her , and I took the cape off her real gentle . I knew she was dead and she would n't be needin ' it , and that boy baby would catch his death if I took him out bare-naked like that . She was probably the baby 's Ma ; a right pretty woman she was but smashed up something shameful . So anyhow , to make a long story short , I got that baby boy back across that Niagary falls somehow , and laid him down by his Pa . The man opened his eyes kind , and said in a choky voice , " Take care  --  baby . " I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up to the house where Marthy could doctor him . The man told me not to bother . " I dying , " he says . " We come from planet  --  star up there  --  crash here  --  " His voice trailed off into a language I could n't understand , and he looked like he was praying . I bent over him and held his head on my knees real easy , and I said , " Do n't worry , mister , I 'll take care of your little fellow until your folks come after him . Before God I will . " So the man closed his eyes and I said , Our Father which art in Heaven , and when I got through he was dead . I got him up on Kate , but he was cruel heavy for all he was such a tall skinny fellow . Then I wrapped that there baby up in the cape thing and took him home and give him to Marthy . And the next day I buried the fellow in the south medder and next meetin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brung him up just like our own kids . That 's all . All ? Mr. Emmett , did n't you ever find out where that ship really came from ? Why , Rev'rend , he said it come from a star . Dying men do n't lie , you know that . I asked the Teacher about them planets he mentioned and she says that on one of the planets  --  ca n't rightly remember the name , March or Mark or something like that  --  she says some big scientist feller with a telescope saw canals on that planet , and they 'd hev to be pretty near as big as this-here Erie canal to see them so far off . And if they could build canals on that planet I d'no why they could n't build a flying machine . I went back the next day when the water was down a little , to see if I could n't get the rest of them folks and bury them , but the flying machine had broke up and washed down the crick . Marthy 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . We never did tell Matt , though . Might make him feel funny to think he did n't really b'long to us . But  --  but  --  Mr. Emmett , did n't anybody ask questions about the baby  --  where you got it ? Well , now , I 'll ' low they was curious , because Marthy had n't been in the family way and they knew it . But up here folks minds their own business pretty well , and I jest let them wonder . I told Liza Grace I 'd found her new little brother in the back pasture , and o' course it was the truth . When Liza Grace growed up she thought it was jest one of those yarns old folks tell the little shavers . And has Matthew ever shown any differences from the other children that you could see ? Well , Rev'rend , not so 's you could notice it . He 's powerful smart , but his real Pa and Ma must have been right smart too to build a flying contraption that could come so far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started reading folks ' minds , which did n't seem exactly right . He 'd tell Marthy what I was thinkin ' and things like that . He was just at the pesky age . Liza Grace and Minnie were both a-courtin ' then , and he 'd drive their boy friends crazy telling them what Liza Grace and Minnie were a-thinking and tease the gals by telling them what the boys were thinking about . There were n't no harm in the boy , though , it was all teasing . But it just were n't decent , somehow . So I tuk him out behind the woodshed and give his britches a good dusting just to remind him that that kind of thing were n't polite nohow . And Rev'rend Doane , he ai n't never done it sence.
