Shades of Dec. 7 <P> Sir : <P> . . . Some politicians in Washington seem to think that the Korean campaign will be a trivial one , in which a few of our forces will get some combat experience for a month or two , and it will then be polished off . <P> Shades of Dec. 7 , when we thought we 'd lick the Japanese in six weeks ! . . . <P> KEMP CATLETT CHRISTIAN <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> Watch Your Language , Comrade <P> Sir : <P> I wish to point out an additional reason for banning the word " Spasibo " in the Soviet Union TIME , July 3 .

In your review in the same issue of Poems by Christopher Smart you say that " Editor Robert Brittain 's efforts may rescue Smart from his long imprisonment in a literary footnote . " It is true that Smart had to wait a long time to receive his proper praise ( and appraisal ) as a highly original poet .

PEARSON <P> Roslyn Heights , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> . . . Housebuilder Levitt is quoted as saying : " In Levittown 99% of the people pray for us .
