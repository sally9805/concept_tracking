txt President Eisenhower addressed an urgent appeal tonight to the balking Israeli Government to withdraw " with the utmost speed " from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of : Aqaba area . The appeal was dispatched late this evening after a day of era-. ical events suggesting that Israel The text of Eisenhower 's letter to Ben-Gurion , is on P ? yeli , wanted still further United States support before carrying out her pledge to purl out of the two critical areas . The President 's letter , addressed to Premier David BenGurion , was designed to calm fresh Israeli fears that their United States support in the United Nation , ; was wavering . The letter declared that Israel would have " no cause to regret " her decision to pull out . It was the United States ' view , lie President added , that the withdrawal should be followed by " a united effort by all of the nations to bring about conditions in the area more stable , more tranquil and more conducive to the general welfare than those which existed heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli hopes for such stability and tranquility will not be " in vain , " he added . The Presidential appeal was calculated to recoup an apparently deteriorating situation in which the Israelis indicated tolay that they had undergone a // major change of mind about their United Nations pledge yesterday to withdraw . It was hoped here that the letter would satisfy the Israelis ' demands for still firmer evidence of United States sympathy than they already had . It reflected deep United States concern that ! Israel intended to delay the troop withdrawal . Late this afternoon Mr. Dulles and Abba Eban , Israeli Ambassador . met privately to discuss the new Israeli position . None of the participants would comment on the conference . The hurriedly arranged talk was held against a background of hints , speculation and confusing reports from Israel suggesting that she might renege on the withdrawal agreement unless firmer security guarantees could be obtained from the United States . The motivations behind the Israelis ' apparent abrupt change of heart remained obscure here , but they seemed to he a blend of internal political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs and a sudden loss of confidence in American support for Israel 's withdrawal terms . Against this background , Mr. Eban flew from New York to Washington this afternoon to confer with Mr. Dulles at the Secretary 's home . The State Department would say only that , Mr. Eban saw the Secretary to ' give him a " report on his impressions concerning what tran- ! spired yesterday in the General ' . Assembly . " The Israelis have asked for assurances that Egypt will not be ' allowed to reoccupy the Gaza Strip , whence guerrilla raids ere launched . before her invasion of the Sinai Peninsula last fall . Israel also wants guarantees that the ! Egyptians will not again block ! passage to the Israeli port of ! Elath , at the northern end of the ' Gulf of Aqaba . Week-end crises stemming from Israeli requests for " clari-i fication " of United States atti- ! tudes on withdrawal have become almost routine in the last month . Today , however , officials seemed baffled as to whether they were confronted with a week-end crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were baffled , too , by reports that Premier Ben-Gurion was dissatisfied with the expression of the United States position set before the General Assembly yesterday by Henry Cabot Lodge , United States delegate to the United Nations . It is understood that Mr. Eban discussed Mr. Lodge 's speech with Mr. Dulles today. , While the , Israelis were informed beforehand of the substance of the ' Lodge speech , it apparently did not correspond entirely with what they had been led to expect . Mr. Eban was understood to have sought clarification particularly of Mr. Lodge 's statement that United Nations troops should take over the Gaza Strip " in the first instance . " Appar ' ently the Israelis received the impression from this that it would not be long after " the first instance " before Egyptian troops moved back into the Strip . Israel has been mist anxious to obtain firm assurances that the United States would work to prevent the United Nations forces from leaving the Gaza . Strip quickly , opening the way for such Egyptian return . Mr. Dulles. it is understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis now went back on their decision to withdraw he could see no alternative to United Nations pressure on Israel . The deepest concern this afternoon was that the Israeli maneuvers indicated a delay in withdrawal that would produce further deterioration in the Middle Eastern situation . After weeks of protracted conversations with Mr. Dulles , Israel agreed to the withdrawal yesterday in the United Nations.I She announced that her moves would be predicated on certain " assumptions " about what the United Nations , with United States backing , would attempt to do after withdrawal to protect her shipping and border from belligerent Egyptian acts . State Department officials retired last night in dread that they would wake this morning to the heated Arab protests against the Israeli " assumptions . " To their surprise , the discord emanated from Israel . State Departments officials said the evidence suggested that the Israelis now wanted to delay withdrawal until the United Nations debate on the Middle East crisis had been formally ended .                   @ @
