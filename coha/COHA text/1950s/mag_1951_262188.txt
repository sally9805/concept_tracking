In the world of peephole journalism , there is no more beautiful relationship than that between Columnist Walter Winchell and Sherman Billingsley , owner of Manhattan 's famed Stork Club . Oklahoman Billingsley dates the beginning of his club 's fabulous success from the day Winchell first came in and pronounced it " the New Yorkiest place in town . " Since then Winchell has always had his own table there , and uses the Stork as his night office . There , he has planned many of the crusades which have gradually promoted him in his own esteem from gossip reporter to the foremost champion of human rights . But last week the Champ was screaming as shrilly as the kind of drunken blonde that Billingsley never , never allows in his club . Walter had been accused of ignoring an act of " discrimination " * that was made no more than a table-hopper 's hop from his Cub Room table . <P> No Crabrneat . The discriminee was tall , tan Josephine Baker , the sleek Negro singer who first achieved fame in Paris by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Baker and some friends ( Roger Rico , current male lead in South Pacific , Mrs. Rico and Mrs. Bessie Buchanan , an old friend of Miss Baker 's ) had sat down in the Cub Room , where they were served a round of drinks . Then Miss Baker ordered a crabmeat cocktail , a steak and a bottle of wine . One hour later , according to friends , nothing had been served , and the waiters were playing a rotary defense . Josephine , who has made something of a specialty of creating incidents since her return to the U.S. last spring , reacted with practiced dispatch . She stormed into the night to find Walter White , executive secretary of the-National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , to whom her companions delivered the shattering charge : Winchell had been there and seen it all , and never lifted a finger to help . <P> White promptly fired off a telegram to Winchell , demanding an explanation . The row was fanned busily by the New York Post , which often vies with Winchell as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Robinson weighed in . Sugar Ray said he would regretfully quit Winchell 's Damon Runyon Memorial Fund unless Billingsley , also on the fund committee , " cleared up the situation immediately . " Josephine Baker had given the fund the $20,000 proceeds of a Los Angeles appearance and Sugar Ray had just returned from a $60,000 benefit for it in Boston . Said Sugar Ray : " I ca n't tell you how it makes me feel being a member of a committee fighting cancer , and you have a cancer right there in your own committee . " <P> " I Am Appalled . " Winchell began to explain . He insisted that he had left the Stork Club before the Baker incident occurred . Cried Winchell : " I am appalled at the agony and embarrassment caused Josephine Baker and her friends at the Stork Club . But I am equally appalled at their efforts to involve me in an incident in which I had no part . " As a clincher , he added a letter from Walter White himself , doubting that Winchell " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> But next day , White indignantly cried foul . He had given the letter to Winchell only with the understanding that Winchell would repudiate Billingsley and his " anti-Negro , anti-Jewish , antilabor , pro-snob attitude . " Snapped White : he hadn't.
