Names No Names Without naming names or citing specific cases , the President denounced critics who contend his administration is a morass of political corruption and has failed to rid itself of communist influences . He spoke at the dedication of a new building housing the Washington headquarters of the American Legion . The building is three blocks from the White House .

" " Chipping at Freedoms " Americanism , the President said , is under attack by soviet communism from abroad and " under another kind of attack " at home . " It is being undermined by some people in. this country who are loudly proclaiming that they are its chief defender s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be against communism . But they are chipping away at our basic freedoms just as insidiously and far more effectively than the Communists have ever been able to do . " These people have attacked the basic principle of fair play that underlies our Constitution . They are trying to create fear and suspicion among us by the use of slander , unproved accusations , and just plain lies . Halls " Loyal Servants " " They are filling the air with the most irresponsible kinds of accusations against other people . They are trying to get us to believe that our government is riddled with communism and corruption when the fact is that we have the finest and most loyal body of civil servants in the world . These slander mongers are trying to get us so hysterical that no one will stand up to them for fear of being called a Communist . " Now this is an old communist trick in reverse . Everybody in Russia lives in terror of being called an anti-Communist . In a dictatorship everybody lives in fear and terror of being de- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . We must never let such a condition come to pass in this could:Ty . " Yet , this is exactly what th scare mongers and hate mongers are trying to bring about . Character assassination is their stock in trade . GUM by association is their motto . They have created such a wave of fear and uncertainty that their attacks upon our liberties go almost unchallenged . I Many people are growing frightened  --  and frightened people do n't protest . Stop and think . Stop and think where this is leading us . " Warns of Curb on Speech Mr. Truman contended that " the growing practice of character assassination is already curbing free speech and it is threat- , ening all our other freedoms . " He volunteered the opinion that there were persons present at the dedication ceremonies " who have reached the point where they are afraici to explore a new idea . . are afraid to come right out in public and say what you think about a controversial issue . " The President charged that " unfounded accusations " are Made inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual guilt or innocence of the victim . " He protested " that is not playing fair . . . that is dot Americanism . " The American people , Mr. Truman Said , want to protect their country against disloyalty .

" But we do n't want to destroy our whole system of justice loathe process , " the Presdent said . " We do n't want to injure innocent people . And yet the scurrilous work of the scandal mongers gravely threatens the whole idea of protection for the innocent in our country today . " Slander , lies , character assasination -- these things are a threat to every single citizen everywhere in this country . When even one American  --  who has done nothing wrong -- is forced by fear to shut his mir.d and close his mouth , then all Americans are in peril . " Two Senators Hit Back Sen. Capehart R. , Ind. and Sen. McCarthy 11 . , Wis both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President is not going to frighten him with any such statements " All he has to do to stop the honest criticism of 100 per cent ? Americans is to clean house ? sweep cut the Communists and the pinks in his administration , " Capehart said . " Certainly he does n't mean that we who condemned Alger Hiss were hate mongers . " McCarthy said he would like to ask Mr. Truman " why he so viciously attacks in general terms those who expose Communists . " " Why does the President fear discussing the evidence against his planners who have been responsible for the loss of 100 million people a year to communism since 1945 ? " he asked . Then McCarthy flung back a challenge . " If Truman wants to make the fight against communism -- which he calls ' McCarthyism ' ? an issue in the campaign , " he said , " I will welcome it . It will give the people a chance to choose between Americanism or a combination of Trumanism and communism . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
