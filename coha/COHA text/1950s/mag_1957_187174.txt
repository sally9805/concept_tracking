" But what 's happening there right now ? " demanded Army Secretary Wilber M. Brucker in the Pentagon last week as an officer passed along the latest message from the troops in Little Rock . Another officer had an idea : " Why not turn on the television set ? " A set was wheeled up , flicked on , and promptly revealed members of the 101st Airborne Division stiffly at parade rest outside a peaceful Central High School . Brucker grunted with satisfaction . Chief of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor , onetime commander of the 101st , peered hard at the soldiers . " They look good , sharp , " he said , then broke out unbelievingly : " Why , there 's one man whose belt is undone ! " After a harder look , Taylor decided that the man was off duty , resting for a moment behind a tree , and the general was soon admiring his old command again . <P> 100 Million Viewers . It was the first time that a Secretary of the Army and a Chief of Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field commander 's shoulder 900 miles away . They shared the view with millions who , between the humdrum of quiz shows and soap operas , watched the paratroopers effect the historic entry of nine Negro students into the Little Rock school .

TV news directors broke into network programs at will that day , eleven times on CBS , eight on NBC , for spots averaging four minutes each ( and losing each network two commercials ) .

President Eisenhower 's special telecast on the evening of the paratrooper 's flight into Little Rock carried his words to an audience that approached 100 million . <P> <P> Arkansas Governor Faubus offered exclusivity to NBC and CBS , in turn , if they would give him time to speak , but they would let him appear only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' terms-its third exclusive Faubus telecast in three weeks-and promptly got itself dubbed " the Arkansas Broadcasting Company . " <P> The Integrated Networks . By hanging right on to the coattails of the Eisenhower telecast with a 15-minute updating of the situation from Washington and Little Rock , NBC commanded higher ratings than the popular To Tell the Truth and Broken Arrow on the other networks . An hour later , CBS 's news crew turned in the week 's best TV roundup : a half-hour wrapping together of film clips of mob violence and barely dry shots of the arriving paratroopers and President Eisenhower 's speech with a background summary by Walter Cronkite in Manhattan , on-the-spot interviewing by Howard K. Smith in Little Rock , and analysis by Eric Sevareid from Washington .
