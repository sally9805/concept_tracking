" Why bother us this way ? " demanded Chicago 's No. 2 hood of the reporter . The hood was Sam ( Mooney ) Giancana , general manager of Chicago mobdom , and at that particular moment last week he was doing nothing more than throwing a $20,000 wedding reception at the La Salle Hotel for his blonde daughter . The reporter was the Chicago Tribune 's Sandy Smith , 39 , who rarely misses the chance to crash a mob soiree . " Sure . " pleaded Giancana , " some of us are ex-convicts. but are we supposed to surfer forever for a few mistakes we made in our youth ? Look at that kid pointing to his new son-in-law , slicing the many-tiered wedding cake . Now everybody is going to hook him up with me . No one will hire him . I 'll have to give him a .45 and put him to work for me . " <P> As Reporter Smith pocketed the guest list , copied from place cards , Mobster Giancana grumbled volubly on . He had a sneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for a year ; I like to hide from them " ) , a boost for syndicated crime ( " What 's wrong with the syndicate ? Two or three of us get together on some deal and everybody says it 's a bad thing . But those businessmen do it all the time and nobody squawks " ) , the back of his hand for the draft board that rated him a constitutional psychopath in 1943 : " Who would n't pretend he was nuts to stay out of the Army ? I told them I steal for a living . They thought I was crazy but I was n't . I was telling them the " truth . " <P> Binoculars &; a Bus . These quotes , startling from an executive of Chicago 's tight-lipped underworld , made lively front-page reading in the Chicago Tribune last week . They could have been reaped only by the Trib 's Sandy Smith , who knows the mob 's pecking order better than most hoods , and far better than any other police reporter in town . <P> Ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Chicago-area gambling , Smith has relentlessly followed the mob . With a fellow Trib reporter , he crouched for days in a car near Chicago 's taxicab union headquarters , discovered-by the simple reportorial expedient of training binoculars on the visitors , and now and then riding a city bus past the building for a close-in gander-that it was crawling with thugs , hoods and hired guns . Their nine-part expose mercilessly pinned Joey Glimco as the leader of this unsavory band , nominated Glimco for repeated uncommunicative appearances before federal rackets investigators . To this day Glimco spits at Smith whenever the two meet . <P> Like a Picnic . Smith also specializes in covering the mob 's social functions as an uninvited and unanimously undesirable guest . In 1956 he borrowed a room in a neighboring house to survey a gala Fourth of July garden party flung by No. 1 Mobster Tony Accardo . Stung by all the publicity , Accardo subsequently shifted the party to the home of his chauffeur.                  @ @ @
