LONG THE BEND OF THE WEST AFRICAN seashore , north of the Equator and south of the desert , lie the territories that are furthest from colonialism of all those on the Dark Continent . Here the ancient names ? Ivory Coast , Gold Coast , Slave Coast ? recall how far a distance that is . Yet here , bordering the Atlantic , the hot and humid rain forest was long the worst obstacle that Europeans encountered in centuries of im-perial expansion . " Sailor beware the Bight of Benin/Few come out of those who go in . " This was the White Man 's Grave , where the Africans ' secret weapon ? the mosquito ? pre-vented West Africa from ever being " col-onised " in the sense that North , South , and East Africa were . European contact here has been with traders and missionaries , not with permanent . settlers , the land-hungry farmers whose presence elsewhere in Africa is the first condition of racial bitterness and violence . Here the white man never came to stay . " We do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a British district commissioner , a woman who has lived in Nigeria for almost thirty years . " We 're here to do a job , and when it 's done ? or when the Africans no longer want us ? we 'll go home without any fuss . " Now , as a result , West Africa is moving toward self-determination at a rate that inescapably if somewhat unfairly sets the pace for other " non-independent " African areas . What happens in West Africa in the next few years has greater import for Africans and Europeans both than what is happening now in Kenya or the Union , for West Africa is an image of what the future might be like . Not everyone in South and Central Africa welcomes it . " We have an antipathy to the way West Africa has developed politically , " said a Northern Rhodesian mine superintendent whose own racial views were moderately enlightened , " but you 'll have to form your own opinion on that . " MOST EUROPEANS IN AFRICA LINE UP , SOONER or later , on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them like the African , or say they do . Many of them say , and I think they mean it , that they love the African . But a great many love the African as he is , or as he was ten , twenty , fifty years ago . They describe the " unspoiled " men and women of the villages as noble , honest , moral . self-respecting ; the " Westernized " city-dwellers as unreliable , pretentious , vulgar , and sexually unrestrained . This an English educator in the Gold Coast called the " Lugard fallacy , " after Lord Lugard , the first High Commissioner of Northern Nigeria ; but it is a view still widely entertained . Many spokesmen for Western civilization are uncertain even now that the Western way is appropriate for Africa . " I sometimes think , " said another educator , in Nigeria , " that the best thing we could do for this country would be to put a wire fence around it thirty feet high , and go away and leave it alone . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thought of the process of " rural urbanization " that was taking place in the Gezira cotton scheme , he had said : " It 's a good thing , if progress is a good thing .

It 's a pity to put pieces of dirty cloth on " them . " TRANSLATION FROM A THEME , WRI1 1EN BY a West African girl in a French school , one of their most gifted students , and quoted in a French guidebook : I remember the old days , the days of festival , the festival of Tabaski . . . . In the evening I was dressed like a queen . Gold medals in my black tresses , tan coral pearls at my throat , feet stained with henna in my golden slippers , there I was on the town , looking for compliments . Toward three o'clock there were drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances in which I was myself a dancer ! . . . Light , supple , I threw myself among my sisters . Strange power of the drums , where music is movement ; movement , music . The blood boiled in my veins . I leaped , I danced . , .. I was eight years old , and I cried : " Drums , oh drums ! Carry me away ! " Then , one day , came the priest , came school , came the end of my free and simple life . My brain has been whitened , but my head is black ; my inviolable blood has remained pure , pure as the sun , pure of all contact . My blood has stayed pagan in my civilized veins , and at the sound of the black drums it rises in revolt . Always I want to dance , to dance always , to dance again ... . SINCE WEST AFRICA IS AT SUCH A DIFFERENT stage of its history from its neighbors to the east and south , its preoccupations have far less to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first . From the point of view of the British in the Rhodesias , Belgians in the Congo , or Portuguese in Angola , West African troubles can be used to prove that the West African experiment with self-government is unsuccessful . The upheavals that periodically occur in territories where the British are " soft , " according to the Belgian way of thinking , are evidence that you must be " hard . " If you insist on training Africans in England to be doctors and lawyers , trades that Europeans will not employ them at and Africans can not afford to , then you do nothing but create a class of frustrated intellectuals , a forcing-bed of political agitation . If you promise Africans the moon of self-government , say the Belgians , then there comes a moment when you have to renege , and then ? Mau Mau , Jomo Kenyatta , the night of the long knives . Whatever truth there may be in this , it has little to do with West Africa , where such a turn of events is far back down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in , now that they are within an ace of dominion status , belongs to another level of discourse . It is a compound of difficulties that the Belgians too , in their turn , will someday have to face . For example : ( 1 ) Palaver : The African tradition of government is one of endless talk around the campfire , a democracy of eloquence . Often the chief has power only to sum up the sense of the meeting , and if he can not do so the talk goes on , and on , and on . Hence the Africans take to parliamentary institutions with great enthusiasm but sometimes with curious results . When Kwame Nkrumah , the African prime minister of the Gold Coast , first began to frame a program for his overwhelming majority in the legislature , the leader of the tiny opposition made a speech accusing Nkrumah of dictatorial methods . He said the Prime Minister was unfairly using his numerical majority to ram through laws , instead of observing African custom and talking things over democratically with those who disagreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealth have always gone together , and to the African voter it seems natural that politicians should be rich . In the exuberance of discovering wealth and freedom simultaneously , therefore , many of the rising representatives of West African aspirations have not yet developed ? to put it mildly ? a strict sense of political morality . ( 3 ) Eggheadism : Many West African politicians naturally come from the educated urban class . Sometimes , on receiving authority , they become more annoyed with the " backwardness " of their rural fellow-countrymen than were the colonial administrators they replaced . Side by side with the new governments , the civic machinery of the tribes and their paramount chiefs continues to exist , and often the two conflict . Many . European colonial officers have long believed that African self-government can be achieved only by granting responsibility at the tribal level , but now ? in eagerness to " Westernize " as rapidly as possible ? the educated Africans who come into power often feel compelled to tear down their own ancient institutions . These are the growing pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Europeans who have risked the future of Africa on the proposition that they will not last for long . They lend a nervous , hypersensitive tone to a transfer of control from white hands to black which would hardly be effortless in the best of circumstances , but they also make life in West Africa by far the most stimulating that any African can enjoy . For men like Kwame Nkrumah there is no way ahead but on through and out the other side , and for those who make the crossing successfully the prize will be the knowledge that no one has been there before them . A JUNIOR ADMINISTRATOR IN ONE OF THE British areas was indiscreet enough to tell a story that was never meant for non-British ears . He and his wife had attended a dinner for the lieutenant governor , at which that eminent dignitary had unbent to them both . " You , my dear , " he said to the lady , " have not been out here long enough to know this , but toward the end . of your eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper is short and he seems a little snappish , remember that it 's not the climate ? it 's our beloved Africans . " THERE USED TO BE AN EXTENSIVE mythology about the African climate , but it is gradually breaking down . World War II , which changed so much else in Africa , put the finishing touches to it ? DDT , the antibiotics and new antimalarials , and the excuse of wartime emergency to relax European pretensions . One British lady who had known Nigeria before the war told of returning after it was over , leaving her eighteenmonth-old daughter behind in England . On the boat there were dozens of children , and she remembered thinking they would all be dead in a week . When she landed at Lagos and came down the gangplank in her sun helmet , jodhpurs , and mosquito boots she was astonished to see people everywhere bareheaded , in shorts and sandals . Before long she sent for her daughter . Today outrageously uncomfortable clothing is much more likely to be worn by Africans who grew up thinking of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they themselves would dress much more sensibly if they were n't afraid the Africans they dealt with would be insulted . THE HIGH COMMISSIONER OF THE FRENCH Cameroons , M. Soucadoux , sat in his darkening office on a late afternoon in Yaounde and expounded the doctrine of his administration . We had wondered at the exceptionally high caliber of French personnel in the Cameroons , which are among the least well-known of African territories , and here was one explanation : they have an exceptional boss . Like his opposite numbers in other French areas , M. Soucadoux occupies a white wedding-cake palais and works in a short-sleeved , open-necked bush jacket at a wide , imposing desk , with a semi-circle of low , soft chairs in front of it . But instead of haranguing us from behind the symbol of his dignity , M. Soucadoux sat off to the side of it in a small , straight-backed chair , holding upright a close-cropped head like Erich von Stroheim 's and unfolding his beliefs in sonorous , cadenced French ? a living embodiment of what he called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . " M. Soucadoux 's domain , like the brightly-colored stamps that memory associates with it , is triangular , one corner resting on the ocean at the right-angle turn in the West African coast . Out through this tip funnel the riches of the interior , making the port of Douala ? rather than Yaounde , further inland ? the Cameroons ' leading city . Douala suggests nothing so much as a sophisticated cow town , a place of spirited sloppiness , at first glance as commercially wide open as Texas , at the second a culture capital and center of chic . " This , " said the high commissioner 's delegate who runs the port , " is not a city , it is a chantier , a workyard , " and money flows in Douala at a rate that should not disconcert Americans hardened by Houston and Dallas . In Douala , too , some portion of it goes to support the arts : a well-stocked bookstore , a phonograph-record shop with a wide selection of African music , and ? until recently ? one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ( the shrewd proprietress , having made her pile in tourist-type ivory and ebony , has returned to Paris with her own excellent collection of masks and bronzes ) . Here in Douala ? sitting , drinking , and passing the time of day on the sidewalk arcade in front of the main hotel ? M. Soucadoux 's French bureaucrats and traders , bankers and engineers , carry on for l'esprit cartsien in the company of the best-looking , best-dressed European women to be seen for thousands of miles in any direction . At the same time , however , Douala is a conspicuous example of urban overcrowding among the Africans , with cities within the city of shacks whose corrugated metal roofs look barely able to withstand the pounding tropical rains . ( And it rains often in Douala ; not far away , on the slopes of the mountainrange that separates French Cameroons from British , it rains thirty feet a year . ) The contrast between European enterprise and African underprivilege is not lost on M. Soucadoux , a man of good will and a developed sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I dream that I have been given la baguette de fe , a magic wand , and may go through this country waving into existence schools , and roads , and hospitals ? but then I awake , and it is not that easy . " One does not always confer a favor , M. Soucadoux feels , one certainly does not teach the positivist spirit , by making free gifts to a people who do not know their worth ; only by becoming aware how much European sweat is needed to create European wealth will the Africans learn to work and become economically creative themselves . Yet it would not do , M. Soucadoux thinks , to import into Africa a white proletariat of artisans ; they would be a good example for commercial purposes but bad for social ones ? " especially , " he added , " their women . " At the Cameroons ' largest construction project , the hydroelectric dam at Edea , the workmen are mostly Italian ? a compromise that we marveled at , since it gets the work done , furnishes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher things of life . Curiously enough , the French system works . They have a suave self-confidence about French civilization which enables them to assume that any African who absorbs it becomes , for all practical purposes , a Frenchman . Though they may remain socially distant and are at times administratively arbitrary , they seem more able than other colonials to convince the African that their distinctions are not racial , and that any African who chooses to may accept the one unattached gift it is in the power of French authority to bestow : a French sense of style . In the Cameroons the marriage of French with African manners and spirit is an unusually happy one . Walking the sparsely-paved streets of Douala with an educated African , I heard him tell a story about what happened at Edea dam , a version that officialdom would no doubt , have construed as antiFrench ? how at first French laborers had been sent down from Paris but had turned out to be mostly janitors and gardeners , not masons , and how the administration had to close down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? yet he told it in a thoroughly French manner , indicating a far deeper conversion to French ways of thinking than either he or M. Soucadoux might have thought . Not only in Douala , but at stations along the railroad to Eclea or in the DC-4 that flew us to Yaounde , we saw Europeanized African men and women of striking charm and cultivation ? especially women . Women are by and large the conservative sex in Africa , and they often lag a generation behind their menfolk . Not here , however . African women are extraordinary in their own right , but add French clothing , French cosmetics , and French sanctions for flirtation to their own natural talents along these lines and the results surpass belief . The women of Africa have not yet risen , unfortunately , to the height of M. Soucadoux 's luncheon table , where we sat later discussing the American Presidential election ( news of it had just come through ) and attempting to defend American foreign policy against the sharp , polite attacks of the high commissioner 's able young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the meal had been announced by a spotlessly white-coated African 's thunderous announcement , " Monsieur le haut commissaire est servi ! " At the head of the table , M. Soucadoux , now and then permitting himself a tight smile , exercised his prerogative of speaking philosophically . " One thing , " he said , " I ask you to remember . Long ago , even in the days when Stanley was here , the African had a word for the white man , which meant ' a little animal with a long tail . ' It was easy enough to kill him but there were always more behind . So when you go walking down the streets here , whistling , with your hands in your pockets , never forget that your every gesture carries behind it the full weight of Occidental culture ? and you would not be half so happy if it did n't . " And soon we all removed serenely to the living room , for coffee , brandy , and cigars . THE FRENCH , PARTICULARLY IN BRAllAVILLE ( French Equatorial Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in this respect also they are unique . For somewhere in the colonial character there is a streak of masochism , or at least a conviction that life in the colonies ought to be uncomfortable . Many Europeans have a way of making themselves at home in the tropics only up to a point , and then leaving out at the last minute one little thing that might make all the difference ? like ventilation , or plumbing . You have the feeling that perhaps they want to retain the atmosphere of camping out , roughing it , in response to the scale of reverse snobbery ? or Big Gamesmanship ? in which highest credit goes to the man who has been furthest out " in the hush " for the longest time . Consider the matter of cross ventilation . In West Africa the humidity along the coast is fearful , but rarely is the beat any worse than a good scorching summer day in Washington or New York . There is nearly always a breeze somewhere if you can only get hold of it . For such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallways into one another so that the air can get through the building , and there are many kinds of louvered doors that will permit this if a room has windows only on one side . Nonetheless , nowhere in Africa that we stayed was one single hotel cross-ventilated . So much for the triumphant technology of Western Man . IN THE BRITISH AREAS OF WEST AFRICA THE business of running hotels , where the government does not run its own , is left largely in the hands of Syrians and Greeks who are magnificently indifferent to Anglo-Saxon notions of service and sanitation . We got on good enough terms with one of them to tell him that he operated one of the lousiest hotels we had encountered . " I know , " he said , " is n't it terrible , " and he laughed and laughed . III J OS , ON THE NIGERIAN PLATEAU , IS WHAT the British call a " hill station " ? a place of high , dry air to flee to from the coastal wetness . The landscape of Jos is volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gently rolling grassland . On top of one of them is the government-operated hotel , incomparably the best in Nigeria , if not in all of Africa . Unfortunately it was occupied , when I got to Jos , by a UNESCO conference ( subject : " The use of vernacular languages in primary education where English is the second language " ) , and I was assigned instead a hut , a round little house with a grass roof , at the Army Leave Camp further down the hill . Life was less luxurious , but worth it , for at the Leave Camp there was a great variety of people who , like myself , had little to do with the Army . Two of them were civil servants who were sitting , one night , in the Leave Camp 's bar , arguing about the civil war which they expected to take place in Nigeria when the British left . One of them was a Scotsman , the other a Sassenach , representing North vs . South in a , larger context than Nigeria , but both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve . One consequence of the system of " indirect rule " initiated by Lord Lugard ( British administration conducted through the existing authority of chiefs and emirs ) has been that power is artificially stabilized and obsolescent governing machinery kept in motion beyond the time when it might naturally have fallen apart . Unless African custom has been more profoundly changed by the British than the British themselves believe it has , the day of reckoning could be bloody ; the parallel that quickly comes to their minds is Pakistan . It is unpleasant for the British to suspect that in pursuit of " fairness , " nursing along the indiscriminate hothouse growth of all political aspirations , they are acquiring a reputation for pulling out of colonies just before the outbreak of violence . " The trouble with us British , " had said one of the educators who was attending the UNESCO conference , ' ' is administrative : we can handle an infant people , and we can handle a mature people , but we ca n't handle an adolescent people ? and that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , that is , has been used to thinking of his charges either as children or as fiercely romantic warriors , sometimes both at once . As the warrior mentality loses caste and conviction , and as the child mentality begins to grow up , the British imagination falters before the prospect of a hideously unmanageable society of decadent nobles and bumptious upstarts . Hence the use of " detribalized " as a derogatory term for the New African , the semi-educated and self-conscious zoot-suiters of the towns who have escaped from clan and family MAGAZINE rule . Hence also the accentuated tendency of each Britisher to identify himself with the locality in which he works , and to become furiously partisan about its past glories and present aspirations . After listening to the arguments that result , a parliamentary secretary who came down from London in 1948 made a remark that is still being quoted : " If the Nigerians were to pull out of Nigeria tomorrow , there would be civil war among the British in a week . " Such was the warfare , at any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Each was defending the characteristics popularly ascribed to the two regions ? north : Moslem , brave , intransigent , dedicated to the manly virtues at any cost ; smith : pagan or partly Christian , pliant , adaptable , enthusiastically engaged in Westernizing itself . Historically speaking , the pattern of conquest all along the West African Coast has been north to south . Whether the desert horsemen could have carried Islam farther toward the sea than the edge of the rain forest became an academic question when the Europeans arrived in force , but the northerners like to think they could have ; they can claim at least that they were never enslaved by the British but merely came to terms . Now they feel the waves of history rolling in on them the other way , as up out of the south comes commerce and governmental control ? and the crowd of little southern clerks who have learned to add , to type , to think in ways that are useful to Europeans . As one Englishman had said in Kano , the big city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , the next one after will carry every Ibo and Yoruba in the place . " This , the Scotsman was maintaining , is to the northerners ' credit . They are a proud people , the Hausa , and capable of amounting to something . They have guts , and if anything makes sense in this world it is that " we " ( meaning the Anglo-Saxons ) should stay friends with people who can help us fight . Fundamentally it is just a question here in Africa of who is going to starve , he said . The most terrible thing in the world is that " you " ( meaning the Americans ) are starving Europe , forcing country after country to give up its territories elsewhere in the world , and leaving nothing but trouble behind . We ( meaning the British ) should never have got out of India ; the Dutch should never have got out of Indonesia . " Aye , if you force us out of Africa it is the people at home in England who will starve , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throats . The northerners want us to stay , the Scotsman argued ; they do n't go in for the foolishness about self-government that goes on down in Lagos , and as long as they have the voice in the government they have now , we will stay . True enough , the southerner agreed ; he had been in India during the riots , " and if you think it was a gay business , you should see children tossed up in the air and caught on the ends of spears ? oh jolly funny , that . " But this Scottish bravado is n't what makes things happen . The northerners want the British to stay , the southern Englishman thought , because they know how badly the North needs support . He was not an old man but much he had seen in life depressed him , nothing so much as himself , a spectacle in slow decline . " Do you know what is wrong with us ? " he asked . " We have lost our integrity , and these people know it . Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask yourself in your heart of hearts , is n't it true ? " In such times as these mere bravery was not enough . He had seen it happen . " If you want to know what side is going to win out anywhere you have only to ask one question : where are the rifles hidden , where are the machine pins , where are the spare parts ? You and I know where they are in this country , and who 's learning to use machine guns . Your gallant Hausa can have all the gallantry there is , but they have n't got the spare parts , and that 's all that matters . " " Aye , " said the Scotsman , " but the people who have the machine guns have n't the courage to pull the trigger . " Afterward we walked out into the moonlight , on the way back to our grass-roofed huts , and the southerner asked me if I would write this all down when I got back to the states . I said I did n't know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two irresponsibilities of writing nothing at all or of writing too much on the basis of two brief an acquaintance . " I will tell you a story , " he said . " Once , when I was in India , I was an officer in an organization you may have heard of called the Bengal Lancers . A movie company from Hollywood came to us wanting to make a film , which you may have seen , and there was a fearful row about it . They had a perfectly clear idea of what they wanted , and we had an equally clear idea of what we wanted . It was n't until three or four years later that I realized we had both been right . " Good night , " he said . IN LAGOS , IN NIGERIA , THERE ARE TWO CLUBS ; one , the Island Club , is racially mixed , and every month it holds a mixed dance . I was taken to one by a Nigerian , Ernest Ikoli , Nigerian representative of the London Times and " dean " of Nigerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cotton-balls of hair about the ears that make him look like Uncle Tom . ( " That 's what some of the young firebrands call him now , " a British official had told me . " Uncle Tom ? but it is a brave man . " ) He was born in Brass , on the seacoast at the outer edge of the Niger delta , in the days when Nigerian nationalism was not so politically privileged as it is now . " I belong to the group of pioneers , " he said . " I lived in the time when the Governor 's proclamation was law . " Now there is a new generation in Nigeria , " who take too much for granted , " and the job of " infusing a sense of history into them , to keep the balance , " is Ernest Ikoli 's . " I tell them , " he said , " nine-tenths of what you have here is the result of the white man 's effort . " Brave words , too ; for in the Nigerian press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are some twenty newspapers in Nigeria edited by Africans , more than in any other country in Africa . No one is quite sure how many there are at any moment , since most are flimsy efforts ? smearily printed with a hodge-podge of old and broken type ? and few are financially stable . But the real weakness of the Nigerian press is the same as its strength : politics . " Apart from the Daily Times , all are propaganda sheets . " ( The Lagos Daily Times , now a subsidiary of the London Daily Mirror , is the oldest in Nigeria ; its first editor was Ernest Ikoli . ) The largest chain of papers , five in all , is owned by Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe , president of the leading political party of Nigeria and a man often greeted by crowds that shout , " aZIKwe , aZIKwe , " when he appears in public . Politics and journalism , parallel paths in British West Africa , are the smoothest roads to success ? a messy state of affairs , but all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , " Mr. Ikoli observed . " We are the only people who can claim to be purely African . If we fail , we fail . The main burden is on us , now that outside help is secondary . This country and the Gold Coast may influence the whole course of events in Africa . " Mr. Ikoli was consciously speaking for quotation . " The Nigerian , " he went on , " is a fellow with a lot of common sense . That 's the secret of our success ? not only the men but the women . The future of this country is assured , because of the common sense of the people . All the British can do now is make use of it . " The Island club was filling up with a crowd of men and women , black and white ? laughing , shouting , arms around one another 's shoulders . Among the non-Britishers were business men , Syrian and African merchants , and above all Nigerian politicians ? real , live ministers of the government . This has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there should be African ministers ! " I think I must pay tribute to the English people , " he said , " for the way they 've responded . It is n't easy , to take instructions from black ministers , and they 're doing it very cheerfully . " Ernest Ikoli is no simple Uncle Tom , however . " I 'm very pro-British , " he says , " but they 've got no imagination ; they 're too damn stupid . To be very honest , they 've done a fine job of work . I tell them ? . they know I 'm in Favor of them ? that there are a lot of things they could have got away with , except that they 're so damn stupid . " I asked Mr. lkoli if he would try to answer a question for me that I had asked in many parts of Africa : Do many Africans know what it is that Europeans say about them most often ? that you can never really understand the African mind ? and if so what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not more than a moment , before replying : " The average African tries to please . When a white man asks him a question , he thinks , wonder what 's in the back of his mind ? ' and he tries to tell him what he thinks a white man wants to hear , in his own self-interest . If the European has any imagination he will know it is nonsense . If you are an African , you do n't want to ask any questions . You want to see the way the white man behaves , to his children , his servants . I do n't think the African mind is different from any other mind . " Mr. Ikoli left early , needing his sleep , but I stayed on far into the morning to watch the dancing , the drinking , the most free and easygoing relationship between the races I had seen . " The whole place is pulsating , " he had said , and it certainly was in the Island Club . I met some of the ministers , held disjointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tried to strike up an acquaintance with a bright and brittle-looking white woman who was sitting at the har next to an African with a lively and delicately modeled face . She wanted to know why I was in Africa . I said many Americans thought it was about time they learned something about the place . She said she thought that was pretty damned patronizing of us , and despairing of an otherwise beautiful friendship I asked her if she could answer the question I had asked Mr. Ikoli . " Yes , " she said , " I can . Many Africans do realize that Europeans ca n't understand them , but " ? she glanced toward the man at her side , who had turned to talk to someone else ? " the knowledge is obstructed in their minds by something more important , and that is the African inferiority complex . Many of them still believe , you see , that the white man is better than they are , and it will be a long , long time before we are rid of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the conversation had ended , THE PLACE TO FIND RACE RELATIONS AT their best is likely to be the broadcast-ing studio . In every one we visited the atmosphere was one of relaxed and informal teamwork , apparently an outcome of the fact that here . as virtually nowhere else , the African has a skilled intellectual job to do which the European can not do . Shows must be written and scripts must be read in the vernacular , by Africans . The Europeans get them , they train them , and then they make them the priceless gift of genuine responsibility . They have to , for how many white men could tell the difference if sandwiched in between the news items was a subtle appeal to raise the red flag of revolution and start slitting throats ? IN ACCRA , THE MAN TO SEE ABOUT GOLD Coast music was supposed to be Philip Gbeho . He was said to be out at the University College at Achimota , but the day we went to Achimota he turned out to be in Accra , teaching a class at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early hoping to catch him . The British Council is a semiprivate , semi-governmental organization that serves a purpose somewhat like that of the U. S. Information Service , a combination of propaganda and cultural good works . Its office in Accra is a U-shape of low , rambling buildings , in a grove of trees , on the edge of the beach by the ocean , where the air is thick with moisture . In a courtyard between the two arms of the U , I found Mr. Gbeho and his pupils , a dozen or so , about half and half , African and British . " Anyone who claims to understand African music , " Mr. Gbeho had written in the Accra Daily Graphic , " must know how to dance , how to sing , and how to play the drums .. .. " His method of teaching is to make people make the music , and lie had them at it when arrived ? some playing a kind of two-tone double caw-bell , some rattling large gourds with strings of beads around them , some beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest drum of all , the master drum , deep-toned and loud . He would begin by setting a rhythmic pattern for the cowbells , having them practice it , adding a pattern for the gourds , another for each of the different drums , putting them together , and finally coming in himself with a solo that played against all the other beats at once . For the few moments his students were able to keep this up it was quite a show . But sooner or later he would shout at them to stop . " When you make a mistake you do n't hear it , but just remember you 're killing me ! " In the group were two or three British men from the Achimota faculty , three or four British women , two young and very good-looking African women , and a varying group of young African men who arrived and departed as the class continued . The British were being conscientious about appreciating the local arts , and in a curious way so were the Africans . They were obviously educated folk who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " folklore " and on to something else . " The time I feel is now come , " Mr. Gbeho had written , " when we should no longer believe in the old doctrine to say African music culture is bad . " The two girls were especially self-conscious , but they were enjoying themselves and later on in the afternoon , as it grew dark , one of them even got up and began hesitantly to dance . This was only the fourth or fifth class they had held , and Mr. Gbeho was still trying to impart the basic African rhythms . They are not syncopated , in the jazz sense , but rather rhythmically complex ? multiple rhythms , abruptly shifting from one to another and back , with subtle accents and variations . It does not sound at all like jazz , or like anything the Western ear is used to , for there is no underlying one-two-three-four to hang on to . Mr. Gbeho , for practice , was having them walk around in a circle , patting their chests with their hands , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heats with one to four with the other , or playing a form of African patty-cake that takes a sudden reversal of emphasis in the middle to make it come out right . " Any child can do this ! " he Would say . " An illiterate drummer out in the bush can play these things in his sleep . What 's the matter with you people ? " Mr. Gbeho knows perfectly well , of course , what is the matter . He is , as he says , " musically bilingual " ; he has studied music in London and is himself a church organist who " does not condemn Western harmony . " He straddles the two worlds , not an easy thing to do . After the class was over we talked for a few moments before he had to leave . " With the impact of Western civilization , " he said , " we are losing almost everything . I agree that some of our culture will have to be allowed to die , but it is not fair to lose the music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because our rhythms , compared to yours , are thousands of years ahead . " It was the most hopeful thing I heard an African say , and his music lesson was the most hopeful sight I saw : a semicircle of whites and blacks together , around a large black man in a white T-shirt and blue shorts , pounding out on the drums of his people a definition of what can be lost and what can be saved , his eyes round and glowing .
