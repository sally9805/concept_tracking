txt // and he did so in the face of a long history of segregated school systems . ' On the two significant occasions when the Supreme Court has departed from the Marshall doctrine , severe constitutional crises followed . Taney 's departure in the Dred Scott decision hastened the Civil War.e Similarly , when Sutherland led the Court majority in restrictive constitutional interpretations on New Deal legislation , the government 's hands were virtually tied in coping with depression problems . The Court itself , both before and after the Dred Scott case , recognized the danger of the Taney doctrine to orderly and effective govermueut . Answering Mr. Justice Sutherland 's dissent in the t 9 , ; . l ease , Chief Just ire I lughes was quite explicit in declaring : " II by the statement : that what the Constitution meant at the time of its adoption it means today , it is intended to say that the great clauses of the Constitution must be confined to the interpretation which the framers , with the conditions and outlook of their time , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refutation . It was to guard against such a narrow conception that Chief Justice Marshall uttered the memorable warning ? ' we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding ? a constitution intended to endure for ages to come , and consequently , to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs . ' " 9 Although the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment offered no guides to the Supreme Court in the exercise of its interpretive powers , they were well aware of the nature of those powers , and their exercise since 1803 . They knew of Jefferson 's proposal that each generation redeclare its basic law . ' ? They could well have predicted the conclusion nearly a century later that " So far as the Constitution is concerned , it has demonstrated again and again its capacity for adaptation to the most challenging new conditions . " 11 More important , they recognized that the Supreme Court had assumed // the power of redeclaration and adaptation . They knew from the lessons of history since the inception of judicial review in 1803 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that those new interpretations had made new law . And they could have foreseen a Supreme Court justice declaring ( in the course of decision ) that " We should not indulge in the fiction that the law now announced has always been the law . . . . " 12 " Adaptation " does not just happen ; it is a product of the interpretation of words by the nine men , and in many cases , by only five of the nine . Yet the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education was not unmindful that there are limits to its power to interpret . The high court pointedly raised this issue in the third question put to counsel in June , 1953 : " On the assumption that the answers to questions 2(a) and ( b ) do not dispose of the issue , is it within the judicial power , in construing the Amendment , to abolish segregation in public schools ? " The 1954 answer to this query is found not in what was said , but in what the Court did : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are , by reason of the segregation complained of , deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment . " Was this holding a proper exercise of judicial power ? " It is our firm opinion , " declared two leading pro-segregationist lawyers , Cook and Potter , " that the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Topeka not only usurped the prerogatives of the people by amending the Federal Constitution in violation of Article V relating to amendment , but it pursued its pseudo socio-psychological pattern by usurping the prerogatives of the United States Congress . " 1S This argument is derived from the premise that only Congress can implement the Amendment . Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment , it will be remembered , provides the folDesegregation and the Law lowing : " The Congress shall have the power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article . " This provision , however , does not necessarily mean that Congress was given the exclusive power of implementation . With Marbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare legislation void which was not in accord ance with the Constitution . And , as Marshall explained in the Marbury case , the Court of necessity must exercise such power in order to decide many of the cases before it . More-over , the oath which every judge takes to uphold the Con stitution crcates a deity which compels a court to grant relief against inlringem nt of constitutional rights.14 It follows that in constitutional disputes , the ( ; uurt necessarily has the power to implement the provisions of the Constitution in issue , in order to dispose of the " case or controversy " before it . These aspects of the Supreme Court 's function add up to the power of judicial revie The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment were well aware of the Court 's assumption of this constitutional power . They knew of the existing repository of powers in the Su preme Court to implement the general declarations of the Constitution . They also knew that the Court exercised those powers . The Supreme Court , in the Dred Scott case , had de clared unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which had been repealed in 1856 . And Dred Scott was still a live political issue in 1866 . There is nothing in the events surrounding ratification which indicates that Congress or the state legislatures in-tended to prohibit Supreme Court implementation of the generic rights in the Amendment . Lawyers have a complex set of interacting rules and presumptions to determine in-tent in such circumstances . Summarized , these rules and presumptions amount to " silence gives consent . " In this case the consent of the framers was to the normal functioning of the Court in the settlement of disputes . Nothing was said or // clone by the framers to preclude necessary Supreme Court adaptation of the Fourteenth Amendment in the normal course of constitutional litigation . Although the Court has the power to implement the Amendment within the framework of a " case or controversy , " it has been ever mindful of the congressional power to implement by rule-making.15 The problem of reconciling coexistent legislative and judicial powers is not peculiar to the Fourteenth Amendment . On some occasions , the Court has even refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislative branch of government , Congress , also had the power to provide a remedy . For example , Article IV , Section 4 , provides in part : " The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government . . . . " The Court as early as 1849 indicated that the enforcement of this " guarantee " was within the power of Congress , and consequently refused to afford a judicial remedy . ' ' Similarly , when state legislatures have refused to redistrict congressional districts as required by the Constitution and acts of Congress , the Supreme Court has refused to order compliance because of the implementation power granted Congress . ' ' Cook and Potter based their thinking on these holdings of the Court when they asserted : " It handed down an implementation decision on May 31 , 1955 , in spite of the fact that the Fourteenth itself vests in Congress the power of implementation . " 18 This objection purports to apply to the enforcement decision of 1955 only . Logically , however , any criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision of 1954 as well as to the implementation decree . The Supreme Court 's power to interpret and declare a principle of law derives solely from its powers to grant a remedy . In the usual case , the declaration of such principle and the grant of such remedy take place at the same time . In this case , however , // the two were separated by a year , and the decision of 1954 was the necessary preliminary to the enforcement decree . If there is no way for the Court to grant some remedy for the infringement of a constitutional right , there is no power in the Court to declare the law . Yet all constitutional cases are not the same . Disputes involving the guarantee of a republican form of government and the redistricting of congressional districts ? where Congress is given the specific power of implementation ? differ considerably from the school segregation cases where Congress is also given implementation authority . And because they are cliflerent , these der isions are not precedent for the proposition that if Congress is given implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " republican form of government " and " redistricting " decisions is that the Court could not grant an effective remedy without requiring a coordinate branch of the government , the legislative , to help enforce the Court 's order . Since the legislative body , Congress , had the power in these cases to make up its own mind , it might very well have decided not to help the Court . Then , the Court reasoned , it could not order the legislature to make up its mind in accordance with the Court 's determination , because the principle of " separation of powers " would be violated . To avoid violating this basic constitutional principle , the Court decided not to decide anything in the first place  --  and in effect told the plaintiffs to appeal to the legislature for relief . This is what happened in the " redistricting " and " republican form of government " cases . But in Brown v. Board of Education , the plaintiffs were asking for orders requiring state officials to stop refusing to admit them to white schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government together with the Supreme Court ; only Congress and the President share that position . There could be no violation of the doctrine // of " separation of powers " by ordering state officials to admit plaintiffs to white schools . Thus the Court could grant an effective remedy ? the one asked for by the plaintiffs ? without congressional assistance ; and what it necessarily had to do in deciding whether or not to grant the remedy requested , was to interpret the Constitution . The nine men had to find the meaning of " equal protection of the laws " as the clause applied to school segregation . Yet the nine men were not without guidance . The equal protection clause was nothing new to them . The Supreme Court had decided cases involving segregation many times before . And its prior decisions contained interpretations which could lead to the decision in Brown v. Board of Education . Again the Court was to take an excursion into history ? its own history ? still in quest of meaning . Final decision required an analysis of precedent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American system of law lie deep in the English past . Many of the settled doctrines of the English common law were transmitted to the New World ? complete with Latin labels . In many instances a simple Latin phrase was employed by those learned in the law to describe and invoke well-developed sets of legal rules . Lawyers still use such phrases as a type of professional shorthand : habeas corpus , a term employed to describe a proceeding in which a person allegedly confined unlawfully is afforded a court hearing , is a phrase summarizing three hundred years of legal history . Stare decisis , like habeas corpus , stands for a number of rules and concepts which have taken centuries to develop . Stare decisis deals with the phenomenon of precedent . " It summarizes , " writes Cloyd LaPorte , a New York lawyer , " the doctrine which makes precedent so important in the common law and , literally construed , enjoins upon judges the duty of applying to later cases principles which have been enunciated by them and their predecessors in earlier decisions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deciding particular controversies . Stare decisis also directs the courts to a source of law by which cases are decided . All courts purport to settle disputes before them in accordance with the law . It is when judges deem themselves bound by their own prior determinations that those prior determinations become the law . Since the middle of the twelfth century , the English courts 76 // ( later joined by most American courts ) have been deciding controversies between litigants by reference to the holdings of previously decided cases . Judicial recognition of prior decisions thus translates dispute-settling determinations into law . " A mere series of decisions of individual cases , " writes Professor Karl Llewellyn of Chicago Law School , " does not of course in itself constitute a system of law . But in any judicial system rules of law arise sooner or later out of such decisions of cases , as rules of action arise out of the solution of practical problems , whether or not such formulations are desired , intended or consciously recognized . These generalizations contained in , or built upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes , create a system of precedent . " 2 Far more law is made by this process than by the myriad of statutes which flow from Congress and the state legislatures . In adhering to precedent in the settlement of new disputes , the courts are motivated by a desire for consistency . Like cases should be decided alike . But decisional consistency is only a means to an end , not an end itself . " It is revolting , " observed Justice Holmes , " to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV . " 3 There are , however , a great many better reasons for deciding like controversies alike than the mere existence of precedent . Courts satisfy the sense of justice of the litigants before them when they make similar judgments in resolving similar disputes . Law is rightfully popular when it is impartially administered . Then , too , the courts save time and energy when they decide new controversies according to previously formulated standards . Moreover , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts will continue to dispose of new controversies in accordance with old decisions . This assumption gives rise to a reasonable expectation of judicial action and gives confidence // to those about to undertake corporate and contract obligations and the like . Expectation itself , then , becomes a force militating against departure from previously developed lines of decision . Because most courts cite precedent without articulating reasons for their adherence to past judgments , it is frequently assumed by non-lawyers that courts must always decide like cases alike . This is not so . There are pressures which at tunes require departure from recognized lines of dc ( ision . In some cases the parties in litigation actually desire a dcterniination based on the " merits , " without rcg.od to what the court may have done in previous disputes . ' Then , too , tunes J hinge . Rules formulated in the course of decisions involving the horse and buggy are not always apt in resolving controversies arising out of airplane collisions . Old rules must be altered and new rules brought into being . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not limited to matters of mechanics and machines . " Social forces like armies , " observed Justice Douglas , " can sweep around a fixed legal position and make it untenable . " 5 The dead hand of precedent does aot always rule the living . Ex-Justice Byrnes argues that the prior decisions of the supreme Court in fact governed Brown v. Board of Educaion , and that the nine men acted " unconstitutionally " in Iisregarding that fact . " Ordinarily , " he writes , " the Court aas been controlled by legal precedents . In the segregation ) pinion , it could cite no legal precedent for its decision bemuse all the precedents sustain the doctrine of separate but ? qual facilities . . . . The Supreme Court itself , in six cases lecided over a period of 75 years , upheld the doctrine of ? qual but separate facilities . " G But South Carolina 's Byrnes . aid " ordinarily , " and Brown v. Board of Education was not to ordinary case . " In approaching this problem , " declared Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock back to 1868 when the ; Amendment was adopted , or even to 1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson was written . " Why were the nine men unanimously opposed to turning back the clock ? What impelled them to say that they could not follow Plessy v. Ferguson ? In deciding whether or not to follow a precedent , the ( : ourt must eventually harmonize antipathetical goals . A balance must be struck between values which are inherent in consistency of decision and values which flow from judicial recognition of the changing nature and patterns of society . This is judicial labor at its highest level . The Court begins its work at a much lower plane : the first job is to decide which of the three million cases in the law books can be considered precedent . Law " cases " are the reports of prior decisions . They consist of judicial determinations and the opinions of the judges setting forth their reasons for decision . Reading these reports is an art peculiar to lawyers , including lawyers who are judges . Their ultimate objective is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . But lawyers know that everything in the cases is not law . The first step in finding the law requires a reading of the reports to ascertain what the other courts did , as distinct from what they said . Law reports are read a second time to determine whether what was said was essential to the action taken . From these readings a " holding " is extracted . And holdings are the basic structural units of case law , which , in turn , forms the basis of the law of precedent . This requires the process of putting holdings together to express principles of law . It must be cautioned , however , that the principles which might be so derived are not applicable to all controversies . A precedent becomes a precedent only when it is a decision resolving a former dispute similar to the dispute at hand . Thus before a decision becomes a precedent there must be 8o Desegregation and the Law a determination that the underlying controversies are suffi-ciently alike . Here the courts have the last word . If the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior decisions are said to be " in point . " Then the derived principle of law can properly be applied to the new case . In applying the doctrine of stare decisis , the courts often say that they are " bound " by precedent ? meaning that they are inexorably governed by prior cases in point . However , this is only what the courts say . All cases in point do not have the same " binding " influence : they are not all entitled to equal weight . The opinion of a state supreme court , for example , is accorded mote weight than the opinion of a lower tribunal i that state . A former decision of the United States Supreme Court is , of course , a stronger precedent than the determination of a federal district court . Even within a single court , the opinions of some judges are valued more than the expressed views of other judges on that same bench . Here too , the court which must decide a legal issue has the final word as to the worth and effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court of the United States , goes through this same routine of turning back the clock to prior decisions ? of reading and evaluating what other judges have previously said and done . And no matter how the court settles the dispute before it , the new decision itself becomes precedent , ever ready to breed new precedent as the occasion demands . This is stare decisis . Like every other common law judicial tribunal , the Su-preme Court accepts this doctrine . It has developed a great repository of precedent on the meanings of the general dec-larations of the Constitution . For example , here is how the Court has handled Article II , Section 8 , which grants Con-gress the power to establish " uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States . . . . " The Court has recognized the authority of a state to enact statutes // providing for the liquidation of an insolvent debtor 's estate , ' t but a state can not as part of this liquidation grant a final discharge of unsatisfied obligations . This has become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcy act has been in force.8 Where there have been no federal bankruptcy statutes , the states have been permitted in effect to grant discharges 9 limited only by the rule that these discharges would not unreasonably interfere with the rights of creditors in other states.10 These decisions give meaning to the skeleton of the Constitution , and themselves become law ? the law of the Constitution . Each of the clauses of the Constitution has its own repository of precedent . And most of the constitutional law relating to discrimination and segregation is found in judicial analysis of the Thirteenth , Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments . Here are the prior decisions pertaining to the issues raised in Brown v. Board of Education . These past decisions were , of course , guides to future Supreme Court action . But this does not mean that any one decision or group of decisions was necessarily " binding " upon the nine men who were to determine the constitutional validity of school segregation . As Justice Douglas cautioned , " So far as constitutional law is concerned stare decisis must give way before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Justice Jackson observed , " constitutional precedents are accepted only at their current valuation and have a mortality rate almost as high as their authors . " 12 DRED SCOTT-RIGHT AND WRONG The basic precedent in the legal area of racial segregation is the case of Plessy v. Ferguson which set forth the separate but equal doctrine in 1886 . Yet the clock must be turned back even beyond that decision . While the Court as an institution makes history , it is at the same time subject to the // forces of history . Thus any inquiry into decisions involving segregation and discrimination must start with the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford , 13 decided three years before the out-break of the Civil War . History shaped this decision ; the decision itself was history-making ; the dynamics of future his-tory made this the most far-reaching judicial determination of the nineteenth century . Twenty years before the Supreme Court spoke in the Dred Scott case , one I ) r . Emerson , a surgeon in the United States Army , returned to his home in St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the northern part of the Louisiana Purchase Territory which is now Minne-soil . Iteturnin ; too was his slave , Dred Scott . Illinois was a free state . As far back as the Ordinance of 1787 , slavery had been prohibited in the territory of which Illinois was part . Missouri , on the other hand , was a slave state . Part of the price it had to pay for admission to the Union was embodied in the famous Missouri Compromise : all of the territory north of the 36 ? 30 ' line , drawn through the Louisiana Purchase , was to be " ever free . " Scott had resided , along with Dr. Emerson , both in Illinois and in territory north of that line . Upon his return to Missouri , Scott immediately brought suit for his freedom in the state courts . This was not an un-usual procedure . Slaves and ex-slaves frequently asserted their claims to freedom via the legal process . Although these ac-tions were largely prohibited in the deep South , legal argu-ments of a Negro that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts of Missouri and the other border states . The Missouri courts heard the case and decided that residence in a free territory did not make a slave free . Shortly thereafter , Dr. Emerson died and Emerson 's widow became Scott 's lawful owner . Mrs. Emerson then married the well-known Massachusetts abolitionist , Congressman Calvin // C. Chaffee . The Congressman could not , of course , allow imself to be known publicly as a slave-owner , and Scott was sold " to Mrs. Emerson-Chaffee 's brother , John F. A. San-ord of New York ( mistakenly spelled " Sandford " in the Su-reme Court Reports ) . Having been denied his freedom in the state courts , Scott prepared to bring a similar suit in the federal courts . Whether uch an action could be brought in the federal courts was till an open question in the 185o 's . These courts would hear ases only where there was diversity of citizenship ? where the itigants were citizens of different states . It is an unanswered question of history whether Scott was " sold " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro- vide diversity of citizenship . But the fact remains that Scott ook advantage of the diversity provision of the Constitu-ion 14 to commence proceedings in the federal Circuit Court or Missouri . He argued that he was a Missouri citizen and that Sanford , of course , was a citizen of New York . Sanford 's awyers readily admitted that Scott was a citizen of Missouri under that state 's definition of citizenship . But , they argued , a state could not by its definition of citizenship determine who could bring suit in a federal court . That was solely a matter of federal concern . Therefore , Scott would have to show that he was a citizen of Missouri as defined by the Con-stitution . But the Constitution at that time had no clefini-tion of citizenship ? for diversity or any other purpose . Ac-cordingly , Sanford 's lawyers contended that the federal mean-ing of the word " citizenship " as used in the diversity clause could be found only in the intent of the original framers . They asserted that it was clear that the framers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed-oral court . Since the issue raised was the meaning of " citizen " as it appeared in the Constitution , only the Supreme Court could give a final answer . // Decision by the Court involved far more than the freedom of a single slave and his family . Underlying the legal issues were the political implications of the South 's struggle for slavery in the territories . The Union was growing . Some determination had to be made relative to the free or slave status of the territories which would become states . Since a threefifths vote of Congress was required for admission to the Union , and since a fifty-fifty deadlock existed in the Senate , the Supreme Court remained the only agency of government capable of reaching any kind of decision . As on so many other occasions in nnlcri ( ; ul history , the political issue was finally tinned into a constitutional question . And a constitutional question is a question of law for the federal courts . The Missouri Compromise of 182o had sought to restrict the expansion of slavery in the new territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the ideal case in which to determine the constitutionality of that Compromise . The strictly legal issues were not complex . First was a matter of technical legal procedure . Did the Court have the power to review the ruling that Scott was a citizen of Missouri ? If the Court decided that it had such power , it would have to face the second question , whether Scott was in fact a citizen in the constitutional sense ? thus permitting the exercise of diversity jurisdiction . If the Court held that Scott was a citizen , it could then decide whether he was entitled to his freedom . These were the issues argued before the Court in 1856 . Chief Justice Taney ordered reargument to avoid rendering an opinion during the presidential campaign of 1856.15 The long-awaited decision came in 1857 . In his opinion for the Court , Taney wrote that the Negro " had no rights which the white man was bound to respect . . " 16 This statement comprised no part of the holding of the case , but it symbolized in the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this phrase provided the basic theme of a vigorous and successful // attack upon the prestige of the Court . " Of Taney 's opinion , " declared the New York Tribune , " it will be found to exhibit all the characteristics that have marked his career . It is subtle , ingenious , sophistical and false . It is the plea of a tricky lawyer and not the decree of an upright judge . " 17 The law of the case was lost in the maelstrom which engulfed North and South . All that the Court held was that Dred Scott was not a citizen of Missouri within the meaning of the Constitution , and therefore could not invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts . Taney 's statement as to Negro rights was made in the course of recounting the legal history , as he saw it , of the Negro and slavery . ' $ While it might have added to the persuasive force of the opinion in some eyes , the statement was clearly not necessary to the decision . As such that statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compromise was unconstitutional , therefore Scott could not have a meritorious claim to freedom merely because he resided in free territory . The case could have been decided on that point , but it was n't . Taney said further that when Scott returned to Missouri his citizenship claim would be determined by Missouri law ? and under Missouri law as Taney read it , Scott could not be a citizen . Neither of these conclusions was necessary to the actual decision of the Court ? that no federal tribunal had the power to hear the case at all . And that would include the Supreme Court itself . Every court has , however , the power to determine whether a particular case is within its jurisdiction . Consequently , the Court had jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction . And having decided that Scott 's case lacked the requisite diversity , the Supreme Court was without power to make further declarations of law . The opinions of the Supreme Court , just like the opinions of all other courts , embody and give expression to the reasons supporting the particular disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the law . The power of a court is confined to the settlement of the dispute before it , and only statements necessary to settle that dispute are authoritative . All statements which are not necessary to decision are characterized by lawyers as dicta . While useful for some purposes , dicta are not the repositories of the law which should be applied in future disputes tinder the doctrine of stare decisis . The plethora of dicta which comprise the bulk of Taney 's opinion is only entitled to such weight as one lawyer-judge might choose to give to the views of another lawyer-judge . The Constitution as it stood in 1857 had no provision defining citizenship , state or federal , for any purpose . The Court was I ree to ascribe its own meaning to the constitutional phrase " Citizens of different States . " Unlike the Court in Brown v. Board of Education , the 6 to 3 majority in the Dred Scott case assumed that it was limited to the construction placed on constitutional words by the framers.19 And in this respect the Court in Dred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dred Scott v. Sandford , as a precedent , has long since disappeared as a factor in constitutional law.20 Nor was Dred Scott himself affected by the decision ; he was freed by the Chaffees within three months after Taney delivered his opinion . And the law of the case was changed by the very first sentence of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment : " All persons born or naturalized in the United States , . . . are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . " But the shadow of Dred Scott lay across the entire Reconstruction era , and many of the events of that period are explicable only by reference to the case . In a series of decisions during and after the Civil War , 21 the Supreme Court made itself unpopular with the Radical Republicans who controlled the national government . Hostility toward the nine men grew so acute that at one point Congress even repealed a statute granting the Court appellate // jurisdiction in order to prevent consideration of a certain case.22 Taney , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court . Said the New York Times : " Too feeble to wield the sword against the Constitution , too old and palsied and weak to march in the ranks of rebellion and fight against the Union , he uses the powers of his office to serve the cause of traitors . " 23 The Court itself was looked upon as a Southern stronghold within the federal government . It was therefore not surprising that in the ten years following the Civil War , it was Congress , rather than the Court , that played the leading role in creating a new status in law for the former slaves . The enactment and ratification of the Thirteenth , Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were all a part of this Congressional endeavor . Immediately after the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment came the first major legislative effort on behalf of the Negro . Enumerated in the Civil Rights Bill and Freedman 's Bureau Bill of 1866 were the rights to make contracts , to own property , to sue and be sued , to give evidence in the courts and to be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson on constitutional grounds , but the House and Senate overrode the Civil Rights rejection . Doubt as to the constitutional power of Congress to enact such legislation under the Thirteenth Amendment led almost directly to the proposing of the Fourteenth.24 Because of the constitutional criticisms leveled against the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , Congress , in 1870,25 relied upon the implementation powers of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to re-enact the 1866 statute . At the same time , Congress strengthened these Civil Rights provisions by adding criminal penalties , not only for the deprivation of the rights enumerated in the earlier law , but for interference with the newly created right of Negro suffrage.28 By 1871 , the national legislature added the so-called " Ku Klux Act . " This statute imposed civil and criminal penalties // upon those who deprived " any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws , or equal privileges and immunities under the laws . " 27 The most extensive of the Civil Rights Acts was passed in 1875 . Sections i and 2 of this enactment required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments to make facilities available to " all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States . . . " regardless of race , color or " previous condition of servitude . " " In large measure , Congress was reacting to disc riniinatory practices of the South . But it is also true that federal legislation of the Reconstruction period was at times enacted out of motivations other than idealism . The Radical Republicans had obtained and sought to retain control of former Confederate states either by maintaining captive state governments or by military forces.2 ? And the urgency of the radical legislation generated strong feelings in Congress , which , as Justice Frankfurter observed , " . . . caused inadequate deliberation and led to loose and careless phrasing of laws related to the new political issues . " 3 ? Congress had committed cardinal technical sins in legal draftsmanship . Judgment day in the Supreme Court was not long delayed . Little remains of this Civil Rights legislation today . And the nature of the American Congress during the twentieth century has precluded further anti-discrimination legislation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravage of judicial declarations of unconstitutionality are still of considerable significance in the pattern of enforcement flowing from the school segregation cases . THE JUDICIAL COUP D'ETAT Despite constitutional objections , the Court had refused to consider , on three separate occasions between 1867 and 1869 , // the validity of Reconstruction legislation.31 But even before Congress had completed its Civil Rights program , the nine men had begun to limit the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment ? the constitutional basis for this legislative action . Oddly enough , the first major case did not involve Negroes at all . In 1869 the Louisiana legislature granted a charter of incorporation to " The Crescent City Live-Stock Landing and Slaughter-House Company , " and , at the same time , gave the company the exclusive privilege of slaughtering animals in and around New Orleans . A lawsuit followed . The unhappy butchers of New Orleans invoked the privileges and immunities , due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment in their plea for a declaration of unconstitutionality . The Supreme Court , however , held the legislative grant by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the majority , was solely intended to protect the newly freed Negroes from discriminations based on color.32 The butchers could not qualify as members of that protected class . They were accordingly denied the protection provided in the Amendment . Appearing as one of counsel in the Slaughter-House Cases was John A. Campbell , a former Justice of the Supreme Court . He had resigned from the bench when his native state of Alabama left the Union . The right to labor , argued Campbell , is " property " within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment . And , he continued , the Amendment was intended to protect not only Negroes , but every citizen of the United States as defined in the Amendment itself . Since the Louisiana statute deprived plaintiffs of the right to work , Campbell concluded that they had been denied a privilege of citizenship , that their property had been taken without due process of law , and they were denied the equal protection of the laws.33 This argument was much too strong for the Supreme Court as constituted in 1873 . The majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We doubt very much , " declared Justice Miller , " whether any action of a state not directed by way of discrimination against Negroes as a class , or on account of their race , will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision . " 34 Of more importance to the status of the Negro was the Court 's construction of the privileges and immunities clause . This clause was designed to protect " citizens of the United States . " But did that mean only national citizenship , i.e. , the rights of a citizen in relation to the federal government , or did it likewise encompass state citizenship ? The Supreme Court majority flatly rejected Campbell 's argument that the clause was designed to throw a mantle of federal protection around all of the privileges which might be ascribed to citizenship , both national and state . Five of the nine men held that only the privileges of national citizenship were protected by the clause , and that national citizenship comprehended only such matters as free access to seaports , the right to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like . Following this interpretation , the clause did little to protect the Negro , since rights to share in public education , public transportation , etc. , are all incidents of state citizenship . Four justices dissented . They were persuaded by Campbell 's argument that the clause protected the privileges and immunities of state citizenship ; they were also convinced that the word " citizens " was not limited to Negroes . Later , of course , the Supreme Court itself adopted the Campbell philosophy . But it did so by expanding the meaning of the due process provision . There has been no substantial change in the restricted judicial interpretation of the privileges and immunities clause since it was first expounded by Justice Miller in the Slaughter-House Cases . The clause has thus been of little significance in the law regarding discrimination and segregation . True , in 1935 , JusTurning Back the Clock t ice Sutherland spoke for a Supreme Court majority which expanded national citizenship to include the right " to engage in business , to transact any lawful business , or to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the citizen resides . . . . " 95 But at the time Justice Sutherland wrote , forty-four cases had previously been before the Court on claims that state statutes had denied the privileges and immunities protection of the Fourteenth Amendment . " And the nine men had uniformly denied relief . Four years after Justice Sutherland tried to resurrect this clause , the nine men of the New Deal Court overruled his holding and relegated privileges and immunities once again to comparative obscurity . " It was not even mentioned in Brown v. Board of Education . Two years after the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases , the Supreme Court whittled away the protection afforded Negroes under the Civil Rights Act of 1870 . The case was United States v. Cruikshank , 38 in which the Court refused to punish private persons who had broken up a Negro meeting . According to the Supreme Court , interference by private individuals could only be a crime where the meeting was held for some purpose connected with national citizenship . Here the assembly had convened to discuss local Louisiana elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear that the grand design of Congress to enforce enumerated civil rights through civil and criminal provisions of federal legislation was doomed to failure by an unfriendly Supreme Court . " What gave satisfaction to the South and strength to bear the affliction in which they found themselves was the determination of the Court to maintain the true character of government , and to hold , notwithstanding the excited feeling growing out of the war , that the existence of the states , with powers of domestic and local government including regulation of civil rights , the rights of persons and property , was essential to the perfect working of our complex form of gov92 Desegregation and the Law ernment. " 39 In this manner a leading Southern lawyer characterized the Supreme Court decisions in the postwar era . Congress had intended to enact legislation against discriminatory practices which would be directly operative against each and every person " within the jurisdiction of the United States . " 4 ? But this power was denied in the Cruikshank case . " The Fourteenth Amendment , " said the Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws : . . . this provision does not add anything to the rights which one citizen has under the Constitution against another . " " TThis ruling thus limited the protections of the Anlendnlent to actions by a state . Congress could impose no legal sanction on individual discriminatory practices unless sncll individual was acting for the state ? what lawyers call acting " under color of state law . " From the low ebb of Supreme Court influence in the generation following the Dred Scott decision , the nine men evolved the state action concept to achieve a judicial coup d'etat in 1883 . In the famous Civil Rights Cases of that year , the Supreme Court struck down the all-important sections i and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875.42 These were the provisions which had prohibited discrimination in places of public accommodation ? and which had imposed penalties directly against persons guilty of such discrimination , regardless of whether the state was in any way involved.43 Justice John Marshall Harlan alone dissented from the Court 's judgment . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , and for the purpose of securing , through national legislation , if need be , rights inhering in a state of freedom , and belonging to American citizenship , have been so construed as to defeat the ends the people desired to accomplish , which they attempted to accomplish , and which they supposed they had accomplished by changes in their fundamental law . " 44 The Supreme Court , however , has not departed from the // views expressed by the majority in the Civil Rights Cases . This position has been affirmed and reaffirmed in numerous decisions since the post-Civil War period . But the doctrine was merely noted in passing in Brown v. Board of Education . Chief Justice Warren 's unanimous Court neither approved nor criticized these prior decisions . Since only state-supported public schools were involved in the decision of May 17 , 1954 , there was no need for the Court to re-examine the " state action " concept in the same manner as they re-evaluated the " separate but equal " doctrine . With the demise of the Civil Rights Act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further implementation of the Fourteenth Amendment . The Supreme Court , on the other hand , reassumed its role as the dominant branch of the federal government . Oddly enough , the Court emerged from the eclipse of Dred Scott by rendering decisions much in the spirit of Dred Scott . There were many reasons why the Supreme Court limited the civil rights impact of the Civil War Amendments . The reasons were social , economic and political . The Supreme Court justices appointed after 1872 comprised a new breed of American lawyers . These were lawyers who had represented the developing big business . They were innately conservative , and far more interested in property rights than the problems of civil liberties . As lawyers , they reacted against the Thirteenth , Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments as too radical a change in the nation 's scheme of government . These judges felt that too much power had been given to the federal authorities . Then too , in an age of rugged individualism , any governmental regulation of personal conduct which restricted freedom of action in business and social matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery argument in the ground , " declared Justice Bradley in 1883 , " to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to the guests he will entertain , // or as to the people he will take in his coach or cab or car , or admit to his concert or theater , or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business . " 46 Moreover , the moral indignation aroused by the institution of slavery had largely disappeared from public discussion by 1880 . Charles Warren , historian of the Supreme Court , concluded that the Court 's decisions " . . . largely eliminated from National politics the negro question which had so long embittered Congressional debates . . . . " 46 Even before the nine men eliminated the basic issue , national preoccupation had turned from slavery and the Civil War to economic and geographic expansion . ' 17 ' I'lie promise of absolute equality for the Negro proved to be an illusion . The Radical Republicans deserted the Negro , so that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1895 , an era of aggressive Negro leadership ended with the death of Frederick Douglass , a Negro spokesman and a close companion of the Radical Republicans who dominated Congress during the post-Civil War period . In that same year , Negro leader Booker T. Washington delivered a major speech in Atlanta , calling for a new program of racial coexistence based upon the concept of racial separation . And , in 1895 , the Supreme Court docketed the case which was to establish the " separate but equal " doctrine in constitutional law . Homer Plessy , one-eighth Negro and seven-eighths white , was arrested in Louisiana when he refused to ride in the " colored " coach of a railroad train as required by the Louisiana statutes . He then instituted an action to restrain enforcement of these statutes on the grounds that they violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendlnents . The defendant , Ferguson , was the Louisiana judge designated to conduct the trial of Plessy on criminal charges . Ple:ssy 's plea to prohibit Ferguson 's hearing the case was denied in the Louisiana courts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Civil Rights Cases the Court brushed aside all arguments based on the Thirteenth Amendment . Debate on the Fourteenth Amendment raised more difficult legal problems . Unlike the cases which had involved the power of Congress to forbid discrimination , Plessy v. Ferguson posed the issue of the power of the state 95 // to require racial separation . The state action requirement , which had been read into the Fourteenth Amendment by the Court , had been fully satisfied . Louisiana had acted affirma-tively in ordering segregation by race on public carriers . A new problem on the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment was squarely before the nine men ? and the opinion of the Supreme Court comprised the basic precedent for the argu-ments of the South in Brown v. Board of Education . The " object " and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment , according to the Court , was to secure the " absolute equality of the two races before the law . " But , wrote Justice Henry Billings Brown , " in the nature of things it could not have been intended to abolish clistinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as distinguished from political equality , or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either . " " In reaching this conclusion the Court did not indi-cate whether or to what extent it had followed the intent of the framers . But this was not important . The majority was obviously seeking to present its own particular viewpoint , and the method of analysis employed would have made such an inquiry irrelevant . Once the justices assumed that " in the nature of things " distinctions based on color could not have been intended to be prohibited , then the actual intent of the framers could play no part in their constitutional interpre-tation . Plessy argued that state-enforced segregation stamped Ne-groes with a badge of inferiority . The high court disagreed , saying that such laws did not necessarily imply the inferiority of either one of the races . Following this point of view , Plessy could suffer no damage as a result of mere separation so long as the facilities furnished were equal to those from which he was excluded : l ? Counsel for Plessy asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature might enact , with impunity , statutes designed solely to annoy a particular class . Legislation reSeparate // ( wiring Negroes and whites to walk on separate sides of the street , or an act requiring a railroad to provide separate cars for passengers with red , black and blond hair would all be valid , argued Plessy 's lawyer . The Court concluded that classifications of this type were far different from staterequired segregation . " The case reduces itself to a question whether the statute of Louisiana is a reasonable regulation , " declared the high court , " and in respect to this , there must be a large discretion on the part of the legislature . In determining the question of reasonableness it is at liberty to act with respect to the established usages , customs and traditions of the people , and with a view to their comfort , and the preservation of the public peace and good order . " 4 Implicit in the analysis made by the Court is the proposition that a legislative classification based on race alone may be justified under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reasonable . The conclusion that the Louisiana statute was reasonable was based upon the then existing traditions , customs and usages of the people , evidence of which was found by the Court in the school segregation statutes passed by the various states and District of Columbia . Particular reliance was placed upon the 1849 case of Roberts v. City of Boston , 6 in which the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld school segregation under the state constitution . Charles Sumner , later a leader among Radical Republicans , had been attorney for the plaintiff in the Roberts case . Ile argued that school segregation violated the Massachusetts constitutional declaration that all men were created free and equal . According to Sumner 's reasoning , " free and equal " meant that all men were entitled to equal protection of the laws , and requiring Negroes to attend separate schools deprived them of that protection . Sumner 's argument was the first formulation of the equal protection of the laws concept . The Court in the Plessy case had ignored the impact of the // Fourteenth Amendment itself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as had the Supreme Court of Michigan in 189o , that the Roberts case " was made in the ante bellum days before the colored man was a citizen , and when , in nearly half the Union , he was but a chattel . " Concluded the Michigan court , " it can not now serve as precedent . " 6 Roberts v. City of Boston was not strictly a precedent for the Plessy decision , but it was considered as evidence of customs and traditions of the American people . Although Plessy v. Ferguson did not involve education , there is no doubt that the Supreme Court had bestowed its blessings on state-maintained segregated school systems . As in the Civil Rights Cases , John Marshall Harlan was the sole dissenter . ' ' Our constitution , " he declared , " is color blind , and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens . " And , he continued , " In my opinion the judgment this day rendered will , in time , prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision in the Dred Scott case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but equal formula became the law of the Constitution . Plessy v. Ferguson is cited again and again as the case which established this doctrine . And yet , oddly enough , there are no words in the Court 's opinion which declare that segregation is to be permitted where equal facilities are provided . Such words were to come from later lower court decisions which attempted to give meaning to the Plessy principle . What happened in the Plessy case was that the judges upheld what they believed to be the " reasonableness " of the Louisiana transportation laws without providing guidance for the other courts which had to decide these subsequent segregation cases . The principle propounded by the nine men of 1896 ? that a state could compel " reasonable " racial segregation ? was strictly judgemade law , giving a hitherto unknown meaning to the Fourteenth Amendment . It was basic law , but it left unanswered two critical questions : What are the criteria for measuring // equality ? What is the proper judicial remedy where inequality is found to exist ? In view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not required to reach the second question . While logically it should have considered the first question in arriving at its decision , there is nothing in the opinion which shows any attempt to formulate a standard of equivalence . This failure probably lies in the fact that the Court classified the right to ride an unsegregated train and attend an unseggated school as inherently social . And the Supreme Court had already concluded that the Amendment was designed to protect political rights only . On the basis of this type of analysis Plessy had no right to invoke the Amendment at all , even if there were in fact inequality . In view of later decisions on segregation there is no valid distinction between social and political rights where the racial segregation is state-imposed. l Regardless of the distinction which might be made by a layman between political and social rights , once those rights are affected by state action they become political in nature . Failure of the Court to grasp this fact has led lawyers as well as laymen to the mistaken assumption that the absence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a command to commingle . This in turn has led to the observation that " If one race be inferior to the other socially , the Constitution of the United States can not put them upon the same plane . " 8 The assertion was completely irrelevant . Plessy was merely requesting freedom from a state-imposed requirement that he ride in a separate railroad car ; he was not requesting a ruling that whites and Negroes be compelled to ride together . What Plessy was requesting may sound like the same thing as an order to commingle , but it is in reality something quite different . That difference is spelled out in numerous opinions which have been handed down since the Plessy decision . An individual may with impunity choose his social peers by the 10o Desegregation and the Law application of any criteria he desires ? color , religion , education , wealth or hair styling . Once the state enters the picture , however , the choice is no longer personal or social . Discrimination becomes a political matter . It follows that a state may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacts laws affecting voting , jury service or public education . Three years after Plessy v. Ferguson , the Court faced its first school segregation case , Cummings v. Board of Education. ? The Negro plaint ills had asked for an injunction closing the white schools of Richmond County , Georgia , until a separate school was provided for Negro children . At the beginning of the litigation , plaintiffs contended that under the separate but equal doctrine complete failure to provide a high school resulted iu obvious inequality . Then , during the oral argument , the Negro parents asserted for the first time that state-maintained separate schools were unconstitutional . As a matter of technical legal procedure , the contention came too late . " It was said at argument , " Justice Harlan responded for the Court , " that the vice in the common school system of Georgia was the requirement that the white and colored children of the State be educated in separate schools . But we need not consider that question in this case . No such issue was made in the pleadings. " 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improper , since closing all the schools would not eradicate the wrong , and the suit was dismissed . Thus in its first education case , the Supreme Court not only avoided passing on the validity of separate but equal , but also failed to indicate any appropriate standards for measuring equality . The 1899 Cummings case was cited by ex-Justice Byrnes in 1956 as the first of six earlier Supreme Court opinions upholding the separate but equal doctrine in public education.11 Byrnes , however , omits discussion of the very similar case of Berea College v. Kentucky , 12 decided in 1908 . For , in this case , as in the Cummings case , the Supreme Court had Separate but Equal before it a question of segregated schools ? and in the Berea ease , as in the Cummings case , the Court avoided direct con consideration of the separate but equal doctrine . In the Berea case , the Supreme Court had under analysis the " Day Law " of Kentucky , which stated that whites and Negroes could not be taught together in any private school unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five miles apart . The Court sustained the law on the narrow ground that a corporate charter ( and that would include the one held by Berea College ) was subject to the reasonable regulations of the legislature which granted that charter . The effect of the ruling was to allow the " Day Law " to stand , without the necessity of reconsidering sepa rate but equal . As in Plessy v. Ferguson , Justice Harlan reg istered a dissent . The second of the cases cited by Byrnes as authority for the validity of the separate but equal doctrine is the impor tant 1927 decision of Gong Lum v. Rice.13 Martha Lum , a Chinese resident of Mississippi , objected to a school board order requiring her to attend a school maintained for members of the colored race . Since there were no separate schools for Mongolians , she contended that she was entitled to attend the white schools . Homer Plessy , who was seven-eighths white , initially argued essentially the same point ; he asserted that he should be entitled to the benefits of being white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plessy v. Ferguson , the Supreme Court avoided decision as to whether Plessy was white or Negro . In the Gong Lum case it accepted the finding of the Mississippi courts that for purposes of the public education laws , all those who were not white belonged to the " colored race . " Legally , Martha Lum might just as well have been Negro . Thus the stage was set for a direct ruling on the validity of separate but equal in public education . Was legislation re102 Desegregation and the Law quiring racially segregated schools unconstitutional as an automatic denial of the equal protection of the laws ? " Were this a new question , " wrote Chief Justice Taft , " it would call for very full argument and consideration , but we think that it is the same question which has been many times decided to be within the constitutional power of the state legislature to settle without intervention of the federal courts under the Federal Constitution . " 14 The Chief Justice then cited fifteen cases in support of his assertion , but in none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court , ' Taft . then referred to the Plessy case as having approved the decision in Roberts v. City of Boston . This was i  --  large measure inaccurate . The Roberts case , it will be remembered , arose before the Fourteenth Amendment was in existence . And in Roberts v. City of Boston , the Plessy Court had found not a precedent , but only some evidence of " custom , usage and tradition " which justified the classification by race . On the other hand , the fifteen lower court cases cited by Taft were precedents ; they did hold that separate but equal facilities satisfied the requirements of the equal protection clause . The Supreme Court of 1927 , however , refused to accord those precedents express approval . They merely held that Martha Lum could be classified as colored " assuming that the cases above cited to be rightly decided " 15 ( emphasis supplied ) . While the separate but equal rule did come before the Court again during the first forty years following Plessy v. Ferguson , it was upheld only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutionality of the doctrine were not reconsidered by the Court in the only three school cases which had arisen during that period . Failure to act resulted in the continuation of separate school systems all over the South and in some parts of the North . It was clear that such schools would continue to exist until the Supreme Court squarely faced the issue . For all practical purSeparate // poses , the separate but equal concept had achieved de facto constitutionality in the field of public education as a minimum constitutional requirement . But this was the extent of the decisional law as formulated by the United States Supreme Court . There still remained t he question of how to measure equality ; there still remained the question of a proper judicial remedy when and if inequality was found to exist . These questions arose again and again as the lower federal courts struggled to reach judgment in subsequent school segregation cases . The federal district judges could not find the answers in the Plessy , Cummings and Gong Lum decisions , and they obviously could not ask the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower courts could do was to apply the Plessy principle as they understood it ? and answer the questions themselves . From the amalgam of their decisions came the expression and amplification of the separate but equal dogma . Yet , despite the number of lower court cases which were to consider the issue of school segregation , the courts were significantly unsuccessful in fashioning definite criteria to measure equality . In 1912 , per capita expenditure for Negro schools was $1.71 , as compared to the figure of $15 for all schools.18 But measurement in terms of dollars and cents alone is not necessarily the best guide in evaluating a state 's educational offerings . In the Cummings case , the Court had found no vice in the disparity of expenditures in the dual school system . Nor was it feasible to demand identical school facilities as a requirement of equality , since absolute duplication would be an impossibility . All that the courts could or did say was that separate but equal required " substantial " equality . Defining substantial equality was itself a formidable task . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangibles ? buildings , books and equipment ? inconsistent judgments followed.17 When more subtle standards // were argued before the courts ? quality of instruction , school supervision and curricula content ? even greater divergence of opinion resulted.18 Fiscal differences , while easily proved as matters of fact , gave rise to difficult collateral legal questions involving tax incidence and tax classification.1 ? Separate but equal raised many more problems than it solved . The remedy for correct ing such inequality was similarly left to the lower courts . The Supreme Court had already indicated in the Ciiniiniiigs case that closing down all the schools was not . an appropriate solution . No further guidance was given by the Iiiglh tribunal as to the proper relief . The lower courts fashioned remedies which varied from ordering immediate admission to white schools to vague directions to cduc:ational authorities to equalize the schools . ' Writing in 1954 , Robert A. Leflar , dean of the Arkansas law school , and Wylie Davis concluded : " It is generally conceded that the experiment , so far as it depended in areas of governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities for Negroes and other minority races in this country has failed to effectuate the theory underlying it . Until recently , " they continued , " the governmental conduct required in public education by the separate but equal ' rule has seldom been clear , and even when clear , has seldom been forthcoming . " 21 The cases of Plessy , Cummings and Berea were certainly not definitive as to constitutional requirements in public education . In Brown v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court recognized that the Gong Lum case had not decided the ultimate constitutional question . The plaintiff in that case , observed Chief Justice Warren , " contended only that state authorities had misapplied the doctrine by classifying him sic with Negro children and requiring him sic to attend a Negro school . " This certainly does not mean that because the first three // education cases did not technically validate the doctrine of separate but equal , the Court in 1954 was forced to decide as it did in Brown v. Board of Education . Just as the Supreme Court limited its reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings , so it could have , on the other hand , read them expansively . Counsel for the Southern states urged the broader interpretation . The Supreme Court might have concluded that after fifty years of failure to declare separate but equal invalid , it was too late to raise the argument anew in 1954 . John W. Davis urged the Court to adopt this position during oral argument : " Somewhere , sometime , to every principle comes a moment of repose when the decision has been so often announced , so confidently relied upon , so long continued , that it passes the limits of judicial discretion and disturbance . " 22 On some occasions such argument has been persuasive . The constitutional doctrine which extended the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment 's due process clause to corporations became established in much the same manner as did separate but equal doctrine in the field of public education.23 In 1937 , forty-eight years after corporations first received the benefits of due process , only Justice Black was willing to disturb the legal principles upon which states and incorporated associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required the Court to accept the settled practices of the South : " And we said in effect ? and I am bold enough to repeat it here now ? that , in the language of Judge Parker in his opinion below , after that had been the consistent history for over three quarters of a century , it was late indeed in the day to disturb it on any theoretical or sociological basis . " 25 John W. Davis , as chief proponent of the Southern argument , was unable to persuade Chief Justice Warren 's Court . Why did the Supreme Court , fifty-five years after its first educational decision in the Cummings case , decide to call for l o6 Desegregation and the Law " very full argument and consideration " of the question of the constitutionality of school segregation ? A portion of the answer is found in four other opinions of the Court , and in a case decided by the highest court of Maryland . Interestingly enough , all but one of these cases involved segregation in law schools , while the one exception was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these five cases the court ordered integration to achieve the requirement of equality . n 1935 a graduate of Amherst College , Donald Murray , was denied admission to the University of Maryand Law School solely because of his race . In Murray 's suit against the University , he was represented by Thurgood Marshall , just two years at the bar . University officials offered Murray a scholarship to attend any law school which would accept him , but he claimed a right to attend the state-supported school in Maryland . The Maryland Court of Appeals decisively answered the two critical questions involved in the application of the separate but equal doctrine . " The first of these questions related to the measure of equality ; the second was concerned with the proper remedy . As to the first problem , the court held that Maryland 's offer of an out-of-state tuition scholarship was inadequate as a matter of dollars and cents . Murray would have to bear the costs of living away from home . Further , the Court of Appeals agreed with Murray 's other arguments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Appeals in regard to non-Maryland law schools , " he could not there have the advantages of study of law of this state primarily , and of attendance on state courts , where he intends to practice . " 27 For these two reasons , the Court concluded that Maryland 's treatment of Murray not only constituted a factual inequality , but was below the standard of " substantial " equality required by the equal protection clause . // The opinion was equally decisive as to the proper remedy . " Since in Maryland now the equal treatment can be furnished only in the one existing law school , the petitioner , in our opinion , " declared the high court , " must be admitted there . We can not find the remedy to be that of ordering separate schools for Negroes. " 28 And Murray entered Maryland I aw School . Not so fortunate was Lloyd Gaines , who sought and was denied admission to the state-supported law school at the University of Missouri . Seven of the nine men of the United States Supreme Court eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education in Missouri , and that in the absence of a separate equal school there , he had the right to attend the " white " law school.29 Gaines was never to enjoy the fruits of his victory . He disappeared shortly after the opinion was rendered , and diligent search has failed to uncover his whereabouts . The Gaines case was the beginning of a revolution in the Supreme Court approach to educational problems . True , separate but equal was not overturned . In fact , the Court was expressly giving content to the " equal " requirement of the formula . But in giving substance to the doctrine , the Supreme Court began to consider the intangible factors obviously present in legal education . " Petitioner insists , " wrote Chief Justice Hughes in the Gaines case , " that for one intending to practice in Missouri there are special advantages in attending a law school there , both in relation to the opportunities for the particular study of Missouri law and for the observation of the local courts , and also in view of the prestige of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his prospective clients . " 3 ? And , as had the state tribunal in the Murray decision , the Supreme Court concluded that the offer of tuition in an out-of-state law school could not duplicate these advantages . Neither the Gaines nor the Murray situations involved a io8 Desegregation and the Law separate Negro law school within the state . Thus the only effective remedy for Gaines and Murray was the immediate admission to the state-supported law school . This was desegregation even under the separate but equal formula . Justice James C. McReynolds and Pierce Butler disagreed with Hughes ' analysis in the Gaines case . They suggested arguments which the South was to use in Brown v. Board of Education . " For a long time , " wrote McReynolds in his dissent , " Missouri has acted upon the view that the best interests of her people demand separation of whites and negroes in schools . IJnder the opinion just announced , I presume she may abandon her law school and thereby disadvantage her white citizens without improving petitioner 's opportunities for legal instruction ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby , as indicated by experience , damnify both races . " 31 In 1950 , fifteen years after the Gaines case , Herman Sweatt was denied admission to the University of Texas Law School on racial grounds . Unlike Maryland and Missouri , which offered to educate Negro lawyers in other states , Texas established a separate law school . The equality of this new law school was in issue . By the time that the Sweatt case reached the Supreme Court , it was clear that the legal education cases were directly related to the problems of general public education . " Friends of the Court " appeared on both sides , offering their legal views . In addition to the briefs filed by the parties directly concerned , amici curiae briefs in support of Sweatt were submitted by the United States government and by a committee of law school teachers among others . The attorneys general of eleven Southern states prepared prosegregation arguments . It was urged that the Court should repudiate Plessy v. Ferguson in its application to school segregation ; it was also urged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of separate but equal in all areas of public education . The Supreme Court , however , was not yet ready to make a clear statement adopting either of these divergent positions . RIt readily found substantial inequality existed between Texas 's white and colored law schools in regard to the " tangibles " ? size of faculty , number of library volumes , physical plant and location.32 " What is more important , " declared the Court , " the University of Texas Law School possesses to a far greater degree those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a law school . " , 33 The Court had little difficulty in dealing effectively with the formulation of criteria of equality in legal education . As a court of lawyers , it was thoroughly familiar with the aims and objectives of legal education . It could and did speak from its collective experience . No sociologists were needed to remind the Court that , " The law school can not be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would choose to study in an academic vacuum , removed from the interplay of ideas and exchange of views with which the law is concerned . " 34 So far as the law was concerned , the Court 's obvious and undisputed premise was that the professional society in which lawyers circulated was of necessity nonsegregated . There are no colored court systems , nor colored governments . Education for an integrated society must of necessity be nonsegregated to be effective . In the Murray , Gaines and Sweatt cases , the courts ultimately found that integration was the constitutional measure of the states ' obligation in legal education . Two years before the Sweatt decision , the Court had used the Gaines formula in ordering the immediate admission of a Negro applicant to the University of Oklahoma Law i i o Desegregation and the Law School . In that case , Sipuel v. Board of Education , 35 the nine men issued a per curiam decision ( a brief opinion of the whole Court with minimum explanation ) noting that the inequality was patent . Since no provision had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immediate admission to the one Oklahoma-supported law school was deemed the proper remedy ' ? This was not , however , the only possible remedy . While the Cummings case had rejected the proposal to close down all schools where inequality existed , the Supreme Court might have ordered the state to provide a separate law school which would meet the tests of the then standard of substantial eduality.31 ' Phis could only have been done before the Sweatt decision , since that case pointed out the impossibility of segregated equality in a nonsegregated society . But the Supreme Court would not render such a judgment . The Court ( and the judges of Maryland ) held that the rights of the Negro plaintiffs under the Constitution were both " personal and present . " And since they were " present , " the law could not ask Gaines , Sipuel and Sweatt to await the establishment of new law schools . Immediate admission to existing schools was the only adequate remedy . On the same day that the Sweatt case was decided , the Court also gave judgment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sipuel case , McLaurin had been admitted to the Graduate School of the University of Oklahoma . Desegregation , however , stopped at the point of admittance . McLaurin was assigned a special " colored " seat in each classroom , a special table was provided for him in the library , and he was required to dine in a segregated portion of the school cafeteria . The Supreme Court struck down such discriminatory practices in these words : " There is a vast difference ? a Constitutional difference ? between restrictions imposed by the state which prohibit the intellectual cornSeparate but Equal mingling of students , and the refusal of individuals to commingle when the state presents no such bar . " 38 Justice Brown in the Plessy case had assumed that an absence of a state command to separate the races was the logical equivalent of a state command to commingle . In deciding the McLaurin case , however , the Supreme Court erased this assumption from constitutional analysis . Notwithstanding the McLaurin decision , Senator Ervin still argued in 1956 that Southerners " realize that if a valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer have the freedom to select their associates . They would be forced to associate by legal formula rather than personal preference . " 39 Despite the far-reaching import of the McLaurin decision and the law school cases , the Court purported not to disturb the separatE but-equal-doctrine . " Broader issues have been urged for ourucorisideration , " said Chief Justice Vinson in Sweatt v. Painter , " but we adhere to the principle of deciding constitutional questions only in the context of the particular case before the Court . " 40 There was no need for the Court to re-examine separate but equal in order to reach its decisions . This principle of judicial self-restraint is well established . The Supreme Court has often said that it " has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute , either of a state or of the United States , void , because irreconcilable with the Constitution , except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies . In the exercise of that jurisdiction , it is bound by two rules , to which it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it ; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied . " 41 Professor Freund has characterized this as the most salient proposition of constitutional law next to Marshall 's dictate on constitutional interpretation.42 // The Supreme Court in Sweatt v. Painter did not accede to the demands of Sweatt 's counsel to overrule separate but equal . Wrote Chief Justice Vinson , " We can not agree with respondents that the doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson should be reexamined in the light of contemporary knowledge respecting the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and the effects of racial segregation . " 43 The Court had yet to reach the ultimate question : Is racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional per set Ex-Justice Byrnes , citing Cummings , Gong Lum and the four decisions of the Siiprenic Court dealing with law school and graduate education , believed that the Supreme Court had already answered this question . He argued that all six of these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . But in none of these six cases ? nor in the Berea or Murray cases which Byrnes had not considered ? was the issue squarely before the courts . In all of these cases , decision was rendered without reaching the specific determination of whether a racial classification was unconstitutional per se . But the specific question was not avoided in Brown v. Board of Education . The nine men of 1954 had turned back the clock to prior decisions and concluded that separate but equal was ripe for re-examination . Did separation itself result in an inequality which deprived Negroes of their " personal and present " rights as guaranteed by the equal protection clause ? " In the instant cases , " declared Chief Justice Warren , " that question is directly presented . I-sere , unlike Sweatt v. Painter , there are findings below that the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized , with respect to buildings , curricula , qualifications and salaries of teachers , and other tangible ' factors . Our decision , therefore , can not turn on merely a comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in each of the cases . We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education . " The criteria by which the Supreme Court measures constitutional equality had been changed . Chapter 8 CLASSIFICATION AND EQUAL PROTECTION A11 legislation involves classification . As Justice Douglas has pointed out , " . . . one chief task of law makers is to make classifications : graduating taxes according to income , regulating business according to size , protecting people according to age , requiring special health regulations for particular communities , reserving certain lands for specified purposes , restricting land holdings to maximum acreages , requiring some equipment to have safety devices , barring trucks of specified weights from the highways , and so on . " 1 In this legislative process of making classifications , laws necessarily affect different people in different ways . There is scarcely a law which is not unequal ; there is scarcely a law which is not discriminatory . Literally construed , the words , " No State . . . shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affect all persons equally . But such an interpretation would preclude any classifications , and consequently any legislation . The problem which the courts face in giving meaning to " equal protection " is to determine which particular types of classification are so unequal and discriminatory as to be within the constitutional purview of that clause . In other words , the Supreme Court must first develop standards and sub-standards of judicial measurement which will be applied 114 // when specific legislation is involved in a specific dispute . Some unequal and discriminatory laws will be held valid under the equal protection clause , just as others will be declared unconstitutional . Brown v. Board of Education involved state constitutions and statutes where classification was based solely on race . ' Hie specific question before the Court on May 17 , 1954 , was whether race per se is an invalid classification when measured against the equal protection clause . This was not a new question . It had been argued five times before in the five important education cases decided prior to 1954 . Yet the Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact patterns in Brown v. Board of Education , however , demanded the formulation of a definite answer . And , as the nine men proceeded to the task of analyzing the relationship between " equality " and " equal protection , " they gave a new meaning to the Fourteenth Amendment . The words of the Fourteenth Amendment resound with freedom and liberty . And the words of the equal protection clause appear to be an interdict to discrimination . To the non-lawyer , freedom , equality and equal protection are synonymous . This is not the law of the Constitution . Freedom , equality and equal protection are not absolutes ? nor can they be . Like virtually every important word in the legal firmament , they must be ever subject to judicial definition and redefinition as they are applied to specific facts in specific cases . Notwithstanding valiant legislative effort to a ( hieve certainty , all law remains a matter of degree . And , despite the criticism of laymen , there is nothing wrong with legal concepts which can not be subject to absolute precision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think we need trouble ourselves with the thought that my view depends upon differences of degree . The whole law does so as soon as it is civilized . . . . " 2 1 1 6 Desegregation and the Law Absolute equality is impossible . And , as the Supreme Court has observed , " The Fourteenth Amendment is not a pedagogical requirement of the impracticable . " Nor can one " construe the Fourteenth Amendment as introducing a factitious equality without regard to practical differences that are best met by corresponding differences of treatment . " 4 The nine men of 195/1. were well aware of the inherent limitations of the equal protection concept . They knew that " The equal protect ion clause does not require absolute equality . " 5 But the Warren Court also knew that some sort of equality is called for under the mandate of the Fourteenth Amenduu ? ut . There is judicial reluctance to derive absolute criteria of equality from the words of the equal protection clause . There is widespread judicial recognition that the state legislatures are the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sufficient discretion to deal with familiar local problems in all of their manifold ramifications . The Supreme Court is thus loath to disturb the pronouncements of the state lawmakers . On the other hand , the Supreme Court has assumed the power to invalidate legislative enactments whenever those enactments violate constitutional requirements . This is part of the accepted pattern of American government . And it fits the logic of that pattern . Each of the three branches is charged with maintaining certain " checks and balances " over the other two in order to preserve the federal system and make " separation of powers " work . As a practical matter , however , the only way in which the Supreme Court can declare a legislative enactment unconstitutional is by declaring that the legislature has abused its legislative discretion . And in exercising its power to make such a determination , the Supreme Court is itself exercising discretion . This means that legislation is unconstitutional whenever the objectives of that legislation are inconsistent // with the standards of just five of the nine members of the Supreme Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gued that the Supreme Court , as the final arbiter , may in many instances be charged with the same abuse of discretion which its members ascribe to certain state legislative pronouncements . This is especially true when the exercise of legislative discretion is long-established and overwhelmingly supported by the general public . And this is one of the arguments of the South . In analyzing the meaning of equal protection , the Supreme Court had to look beyond the mere words of the Constitution . The answers could not be found in semantics . It was clear that statutes requiring school segregation were intended to solve part of the problems of racial adjustment iii the South . And the Southern lawmakers were obviously t Ice men most familiar with the racial problems facing the people of their states . But there was also present the fact that such legislation created an inferior socio-legal status to which all Negroes were assigned . In light of these facts a meaning of equal protection had to be found . Decision was not easy . What Justice Frankfurter wrote about the judicial task in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversies : " To rely on tidy formula for the easy determination of what is fundamental right for purposes of legal enforcement may satisfy a longing for certainty but ignores the movements of a free society . It belittles the scale of the conception of due process . The real clue to the problem confronting the judiciary in the application of the Due Process Clause is not to ask where the line is once and for all to be drawn but to recognize that it is for the Court to draw it by the gradual and empiric process of ' inclusion and exclusion . ' " And , in Brown v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court " included " non-discriminatory public education under the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment . // The nine men of 1954 strove to act within the framework of prior precedents . While Plessy v. Ferguson gave Supreme Court acceptance to state-enforced segregation in transportation ( and , inferentially , education ) , the Sweatt and McLaurin decisions denied the validity of racial classifications as applied specifically to state-supported colleges and universities . On May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the criteria of equality developed in the Plessy case or the criteria developed in the graduate school cases should be applied as the standard of nicastirenient in the primary and secondary school disputes . Whatever decision was reached , the Supreme Court would he damned as inconsistent . Regardless of judicial rationalizations , the Court was bound to violate the spirit of either Plessy or the Sweatt and McLaurin cases . Plessy v. Ferguson had provided the judicial basis for nearly sixty years of decisions permitting separation of the races as long as the tangible facilities were substantially equal . But , as was pointed out by Chief Justice Warren , the clock could not be turned back to 1896 . The meaning of " equal " had undergone many changes since that time . In assessing law school and other graduate education in terms of its function in American society , the Supreme Court had rendered later decisions holding that no state could exclude a student from the kind of education which one could obtain in an atmosphere free from state-imposed segregation . Such decisions were not based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school rooms , books or teachers . Intangible factors had been found to be of critical significance in the college and university cases . And , as Chief Justice Warren said for his Court , " Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high school . " The Supreme Court had chosen to follow one line of precedent by extending the principles of the Sweatt and McLaurin cases , rather than the alternative line of precedent which would bring Plessy v. Ferguson up to date . // Under the Sweatt-McLaurin analysis , the issue of equality was measured against the probable success or failure of graduate students in meeting the goals of society for which they were being trained . Thus , before the Supreme Court c ould follow the lines of judicial reasoning in those cases , it had to do something which had never been done before in the public school cases : it had to look to the goals and objectives as well as the methods and content of elementary and secondary education . " Today , " wrote Chief Justice Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local governments . Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society . It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities , even service in the armed forces . It is the very Inundation of good citizenship . Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values , in preparing him for later professional training , and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment . In these days , it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education . Such an opportunity , where the state has undertaken to provide it , is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms . " This language did not necessarily presage the end of " separate but equal " as a constitutional standard . There was still a possibility that the Court might reconcile both lines of precedent by distinguishing as a matter of fact between public school and college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the law school cases , the Court would again consider the " intangible " factors . " We come then to the question presented , " the Chief Justice wrote . " Does segregat ion of children in public schools solely on the basis of race , even though the physical facilities and other tangible ' factors may be equal , deprive the children of the minority group // of equal educational opportunities ? " The Supreme Court answered : " We believe that it does . " These words marked the end of Plessy v. Ferguson as a constitutional precedent . And this despite the fact that nothing was said overruling that case . The Plessy case had specifically sustained the validity of racial segregation in public transportation on the theory that the discrimination was both non-political and reasonable . And the Supreme Court of 1896 had said ( though not held ) that separation by race in the public schools fell into that category . Chief Justice Warren 's Court ignored this test . By following and expanding the principles of the Sweatt. , in ( l Mel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal under the equal protection clause . Public school segregation is now unconstitutional per se . While the Supreme Court studiously avoided comment on most of the pro-segregation pronouncements of the Plessy case , it rejected by implication the 1896 analysis of the effect of segregation . The Court in Plessy v. Ferguson concluded that separation by race did not necessarily indicate that either whites or Negroes had been stamped with the badge of inferiority . Chief Justice Warren did not agree : t'To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone . " When Southern counsel invoked Plessy v. Ferguson as a controlling precedent , their argument ran somewhat like this : Legislators must have the power to make statutory classifications . Plessy v. Ferguson declared that statutory classifications according to race were valid where the rights involved were non-political ? as long as the classifications were reasonable . The 1896 case had held that Louisiana 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . Plessy v. Ferguson further held that segregaClassification // t ion in transportation was reasonable , based upon the customs and usages of the people of Louisiana . The 1886 Court then said that education and transportation should be subject to ( Ile same tests . Ergo , public school segregation is constitutional . While the Supreme Court might have followed this line of argument and still come to the conclusion that school segregation is unreasonable , it is clear that Chief Justice Warren reached his ultimate conclusion via a different method of analysis . Mention of the " reasonableness " test is conspicuous by its absence in Brown v. Board of Education , and it is only noted in passing in the companion case of Bolling v. Sharpe . Yet the " reasonableness " test is important in understanding what the nine men did on May 17 , 1954 . While equal protection does not require absolute equality , it does require some kind of equality . The distinction between permissible and prohibited inequality in legislation has been measured by the reasonableness test which recognizes the validity of discriminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between the subjects classified . J Differences between men and women , for example , are real . The Supreme Court had no difficulty in reaching that conclusion to sustain a statute devoted exclusively to regulating the working hours of women . " That woman 's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious , " wrote the Court . " The reason for the decision rests in the inherent difference between the sexes , and in the different functions in life which they perform . " 7 This type of legislation was admittedly discriminatory . Yet , since the discrimination was deemed reasonable , it was held not to violate the equal protection clause . A state legislature may even find real differences between women . Michigan , as part of its alcohol control laws , enacted // a statute prohibiting the licensing of female bartenders unless the woman in question was the " wife or daughter of the male owner " of a licensed establishment . " While Michigan may deny to all women opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not play favorites among women without rhyme or reason . " The legislature was found to have had sufficient reason for making its discriminatory classification . " Michigan evidently believes the oversight assured through ownership of a bar by a barmaid 's husband or father minimizes hazards that may confront a barmaid without such protecting oversight. " 8 Again the obvious inequality of treatment did not amount to legal inequality . In a less rational application of the reasonableness test , the Supreme Court rendered a 5 to 4 decision which upheld the administration of a Louisiana statute providing for the licensing of " State Pilots . " Since those pilots were granted the exclusive privilege of navigating seagoing vessels through the Mississippi River to the port of New Orleans , these licenses were eagerly sought . When only relatives and friends of the river boat pilots were permitted to obtain certificates , the otherwise qualified candidates for the positions argued that the statute was administered in a manner which violated the equal protection clause . Reasonableness was found by the Court in the " entirely unique institution of pilotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The obvious inequality of treatment was thus held to be justified . While racial classifications were not involved in any of these three cases , the judges had all applied the Plessy principle . For it was in Plessy v. Ferguson that the Supreme Court for the first time acknowledged the power of a state to make " reasonable " legislative classifications under the Fourteenth Amendment . And while the Plessy decision was necessarily confined to the validity of separate transportation facilities , the constitutional standard of measurement which was forClassification // ululated in that case became an integral part of the equal protection clause . Real and substantial differences do exist between men and women which necessitate difference in treatment in order to effectuate some legislative purposes . It is also conceivable that the differences between wives and daughters of tavern owners and other females , and the dissimilarities between relatives and friends of river boat pilots and other pilots , are likewise sufficiently " real and substantial " to justify legisla-tive classifications . To the South , these decisions provided the basis of its ar-gument that the Plessy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this assumption , the sole question which would then be before the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education would be whether racial segregation in public education was reasonable . The South argued that it was . Contending that segregation was justifiable , Virginia cast its argument in the precise mold of Plessy v. Ferguson : Since customs , traditions and usages of the people of Vir-ginia formed the basis of school segregation statutes , the Vir-ginia legislature had not acted arbitrarily . And since only arbitrary action by the legislature is forbidden by the equal protection clause as interpreted by the Court in Messy v. Ferguson , Virginia 's segregation statutes were immune to constitutional attack . This argument was presented in one of the five cases which made up Brown v. Board of Education ? and the lower court agreed : " It indisputably appears from the evidence , " said the court , " that the separation provision rests neither upon preju-dice , nor caprice , nor upon any other measureless founda-tion . Rather the proof is that it declares one of the ways of life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public schools of Virginia has for generations been a part of the mores of her people . " 10 // In the South Carolina case which was a part of Brown v. Board of Education , Judge Parker found another rational basis for the existence of segregated schools . " The student , " he wrote , " is taken from the control of the family during school hours by compulsion of law and placed in control of the school , where he must associate with his fellow students . The law thus provides that the school shall supplement the work of the parent itt the training of the child . . . . In formulating educational policy at the common school level , therefore , the law niiist. take account , not merely of the matter of affording instruclion to the student , but also of the wishes of the parent as to the upbringing of the child and his associates . . . . " " l incluestionably , the choice of parents ? white parents ? for- racially segregated schools was symptomatic of custonr and tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in many Northern states as well . The decisions of May 17 , 1954 , rejected these asserted justifications for separation of the races . " Segregation in public education , " summed up Chief Justice Warren , in Bolling v. Sharpe , " is not reasonably related to any proper governmental objective . . . . " An even stronger finding is implicit in Brown v. Board of Education . The conclusion of May 17 , 1954 , was the logical result of accepting either of two propositions . lAfter examining the sociological data before them , the nine men may have decided that the harm produced by racial segregation in education outweighed the " way of life " argument . The Court may then have reasoned that the imbalance was so extreme as to brand the judgment of the Southern legislatures unreasonable ? and therefore unconstitutional . On the other hand , the Supreme Court may have been convinced that a classification based on race is irrational per se , and consequently can not be justified under any circumstances . There // is support for both propositions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued in support of both propositions when he appeared for plaintiffs in the segregation cases . " Even if the Fourteenth Amendment did not per se invalidate racial distinctions as a matter of law , " reads the NAACP brief , " the racial segregation challenged in the instant case would run afoul of the conventional test established for application of the equal protection clause because the racial classifications here have no reasonable relation to any valid legislative purpose . " 12 The conventional test is the test of reasonableness , and its application necessitates a balancing of factual information . True , the Supreme Court , as an appellate court , does not hear and examine witnesses in order to obtain facts . " Also , as an appellate court , " explains Justice Jackson in his posthumous book , " it properly can act only on the state of facts revealed by the record made in the court below , supplemented sometimes by general information of which it may take judicial notice . " 13 And there were ample facts in the record before the Court which might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equal protection clause . Chapter 9 THE NEW EQUALITY Before the Supreme Court on May 17 , 1954 , was a mass of factual data on all aspects of the segregation problem . Some of these data were in the records of the proceedings in the lower courts ; some were contained in the briefs of opposing counsel ; some could be found in the various sociological and psychological treatises which had been called to the attention of the nine men who had to reach decision . Some of these data were already known to these same nine men as a matter of common knowledge . And the influence of these data on the decision in Brown v. Board of Education has resulted in a welter of misunderstandings , which has led , in turn , to both unwarranted praise and criticism . The 1896 Supreme Court made law in Plessy v. Ferguson when it gave approval to state-imposed racial segregation ? qualified only by the limitations that the rights affected be social rather than political and that the classification be reasonable . The 1954 Supreme Court might have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude that segregation could not be reasonable . There was some evidence that the 1954 Court did just that . " Segregation in public education is not reasonably related to any proper governmental objective , " wrote Chief Justice Warren in the companion case of Bolling v. Sharpe , dealing with separate school facilities in the District of Columbia . But discussions of reasonableness stop at this point . It is 126 // clear that the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education utilized the factual data before them in a different way ? a way which had nothing to do with the use of data under the Plessy v. Ferguson formula . Thus it was that the Supreme Court made new law on May 17 , 1954 , reaching decision via a judicial road which neither necessitated nor permitted the specific overruling of the 1896 determination . The South has criticized this approach of Chief Justice Warren 's Court . The South has condemned the nine men for making law , rather than applying the law which was already made in Plessy v. Ferguson . The criticism , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of the Constitution are necessarily broad and all-inclusive , they are also necessarily vague . Save in rare instances , they can not be applied directly . Constitutional decisions involve a two-stage process . Before the Supreme Court can arrive at the ultimate rule of law which finally decides a legal issue in controversy , it must have a constitutional standard to apply . And constitutional standards are themselves rules of law . Since the 1954 Court chose not to follow the standard created in Plessy v. Ferguson , it was necessarily announcing a new rule of law ? a rule of law which , in this instance , was a logical extension of the standards which had been created in the Sweatt and McLaurin cases . The role of the Supreme Court in formulating a constitutional standard is quite different from the job of applying that standard to test the constitutionality of a statute . Both tasks may have to be performed in a single case . But the process by which the judges perform these functions varies according to the task at hand . When the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus , " points out Federal District Judge Charles E. Wyzanski , " the focus of inquiry be128 Desegregation and the Lazo comes not what judgment is permissible , but what judgment is sound . " 1 In formulating sound constitutional standards , the Court becomes a rule-making body . In that guise it utilizes factual data in much the same way as any other rule-making entity . The Court must consider the nature and scope of the problem at hand ; it must compare the possible solutions ; it must analyze the foreseeable consequences likely to result from the application of the standard . " Usually , to be sure , " writes Judge Wyzanski , " diligent counsel offer in evidence enough relevant material . But where this has not been clone , there have been times when a judge has tended to reach leis result partly on the basis of general infornuction and partly on the basis of his studies in a library . This tendency of a court to inform itself has increased in recent years following the lead of the Supreme Court of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory interpretation but also in the formulation of judge-made rules of law , the justices have resorted , in footnotes and elsewhere , to references drawn from legislative hearings , studies by executive departments , and scholarly monographs . " 2 This formulation of a constitutional standard is the first stage in the two-stage process of constitutional decision . Having formulated the standard , the Court must then consider factual data in the application of that standard . Since the creation of the famed " Brandeis brief " in 1906 , lawyers have realized the advantages of using nonlegal as well as legal material in their job of persuading the courts . Louis Brandeis , later Mr. Justice Brandeis , originator of this technique , was one of the counsel who successfully advocated the constitutionality of Oregon legislation regulating the number of hours women could be employed in laundries . In its opinion upholding the Oregon statute , the Supreme Court observed : // " It may not be amiss , in the present case , before examining the constitutional question , to notice the course of legislation , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the brief filed by Mr. Louis D. Brandeis for the defendant in error is a very copious collection of all these matters . . . . The legislation and opinions referred to . . . may not be , technically speaking , authorities , and in them is little or no discussion of the constitutional question presented to us for determination , yet they are significant of a widespread belief that woman 's physical structure , and the functions she performs in consequence thereof , justify special legislation restricting or qualifying the conditions under which she should be permitted to toil . " 3 Even before the advent of the Brandeis brief , judges could acquire ( and be persuaded by ) information on pertinent nonlegal materials through a technique called judicial notice . Underlying this technique is the assumption that judges are aware of what is common knowledge , and may refresh recollection by reference to almanacs , dictionaries , encyclopedias and the like . But in some instances the courts have dignified loose statements as facts derived from judicial notice without revealing the source of their " common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plessy v. Ferguson when they wrote : " The underlying fallacy of plaintiff 's argument is the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority . . . . " 4 The alleged knowledge in the possession of the Court upon which it could characterize the plaintiffs argument as a fallacy was certainly not revealed . In constitutional litigation prior to Brown v. Board of Education , the Brandeis brief was used only in arguments supporting the validity of statutes . This was the practical result of the conventional test . It was not difficult to present sociological and economic information to show that there
