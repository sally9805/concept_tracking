A HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES , Vol . Ill : THE AGE OF REVOLUTION ( 402 pp. ) - Winston S. Churchill-Dodd , Mead ( $6 ) . <P> <P> Two typical qualities mark the third volume of Winston Churchill 's History of the English-Speaking Peoples ( there is a final volume on The Nineteenth Century yet to come ) . One quality is control ; Churchill manages to grasp a huge and chaotic period ( 1688-1815 ) without ever letting a war , a revolution or a leading character get out of hand in the plot . The other quality is a kind of historical cosmopolitanism scarcely to be found in any other writer ; Churchill ranges from English county politics to American economic discontents to the last stirrings of the Holy Roman Empire to French diplomacy to Oriental intrigues with a total ease that once again reveals him as a world figure with worldwide comprehension . <P> Mighty men stride the stage , and Churchill treats them as his equals ; he writes about them with the sure instinct of a man who has more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs . Marlborough . Nelson . Napoleon . <P> Wellington , Washington , Clive . all appear here not as figures out of a distant past , but as men whose acts and words are still part of a living heritage . <P> It is a bloody period , with war almost incessant , and revolution flailing about furiously , uncontrollably . In England , the Catholic monarchy was brought to an end ; in France the guillotine and Napoleon drowned liberty in blood ; in the American , colonies a war was fought that brings distress to Churchill even now . An old hand at portraiture , he can cut down to size those who displease him . Of King George I : " Here on English soil stood an unprepossessing figure , an obstinate and humdrum German martinet with dull brains and coarse tastes . " When he describes combat , which is a good deal of the time , his ardent prose is apt to be high-flown : " The lure of gold and the sting of Cadiz inspired the leaders , and at last they let loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Churchill 's History is neither original nor exhaustive . The social and literary sides of life are notably skimped , but Churchill succeeds in what he set out to do : to give in broad outline a framework within which great men decide great issues and great events are triggered at decisive points .
