The force that gives the U.S. economy its pep is being generated more and more in the teeming aisles of the nation 's stores . From the Commerce Department last week came an estimate that retail sales in October reached $18.3 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis , a 7.8% gain over last year 's level and the first time October sales have burst through the $18 billion mark . In November 's first week , sales in U.S. department stores were running 5% ahead of last year . Retail sales for the first ten months of 1959 total $179.9 billion , 9% above 1958 . At that rate , they will push well over $200 billion by year 's end , a new alltime record . <P> The most remarkable fact about consumer buying is that nothing seems to deter it . During both the recession and the steel strike , consumers held to their buying pace , thus bolstered the economy in a key area just when it needed support . Now , though personal income has leveled off , the consumer is still stepping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major causes of the phenomenon , along with the changing habits of U.S. consumers . They no longer hold on to suits , coats and dresses as if they were heirlooms ; determined promotion campaigns keep apparel one of the hottest selling items . Furniture , refrigerators , rugs-all once bought to last for years or life-are now replaced with register-tingling regularity . <P> Such nondurable goods as clothing , food and gasoline still account for two-thirds of the consumer 's purchases , reached a sales total of $12 billion in October . Bigger gains have been run up in the durable field ( see chart ) , where October sales hit $6.3 billion , up 17% over last year and nearly 10% over September . The durables got a hefty boost in October from soaring sales of Detroit 's 1960 auto models , will probably level off this month because of a shortage of cars caused by the steel strike . <P> The strike caused no shortage in other areas where the consumer likes to pour out his cash . September output of major appliances was up 30% over last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothing up 14% . With steelworkers back at their jobs and laid-off auto workers gradually going back , merchants are already looking forward to record Christmas buying .
