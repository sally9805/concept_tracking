" Oh , God , " moaned an overemotional Siamese consul in Singapore last week , " what will happen to our King now ? " The answer to this rhetorical question-in a land which most Americans are apt to regard as a musical-comedy setting-was : nothing whatever . In the 19 years since Siam became a constitutional monarchy , her political history has been punctuated by eight coups d'etat , none of which had any profound effect on the powerless ruling House of Chakkri . Last week , young hepcat King Phumiphon Adundet , * his pretty Queen Sirikit and their eight-month-old daughter Princess Lotus Precious Stone arrived home from Switzerland to find their nation just recovering from one of the quietest coups in its history . <P> The dancing feet in Bangkok 's perennially gay nightspots had scarcely missed a beat when the government radio announced that " due to present world tension and the Communist infiltration in parliamentary circles , the Army , Navy , Air Force , police and patriotic Siamese had found it necessary to stage a military coup d'etat . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a revolution by news broadcast . <P> There were two good reasons why the coup was quiet : 1 ) all the nation 's armed forces for once " were on the same side ; 2 ) efficient strong-man Premier Phibun Songgram , the ablest engineer of coups in the country , had staged this one against himself to streamline his government . After four hours , during which he was thrown out of office by prearrangement with his generals , admirals and air marshals , the Premier re-emerged at the head of a government more powerful than ever . <P> The only victim was Siamese democracy itself , never a vigorous adversary . In place of a two-chamber parliament , half of whose members were elected , Phibun 's new government would operate by consent of a one-chamber , one-party parliament , all of whose members would be appointed by Phibun . <P> <P> * Composer of Blue Night , in Mike Todd 's Broadway musical , Peep Show .                    @
