txt Record heat and a wildcat subway strike last week failed to hold down the booming sales of New York City department stores . In fact , most spokesmen said the soaring temperatures gave such a boost to sales of summer items that it more than wiped out any damaging effect on other departments . Sales of the nine major stores which report weekly to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were up 9% from the like week of 1955 , a figure which one store official called " sur " prising , in view of the weather . " Considered even more surprising was the fact that many of the stores were able to top the year-earlier figure on Thursday , when the mercury climbed to a record 96 degrees . On the like date last year . said one executive , the high temperature was nine degrees cooler  --  and for the entire week it ranged in the middle 80 's . This year the sudden heat spurred lagging volume in departments devoted to making summertime more enjoyable , or at-least more endurable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just went out of sight , " exclaimed one official , " and we did almost as well in such things as electric fans , wading pools and outdoor furniture . " Another store , whose over-all volume gain exceeded the city average , was more specific . " The sales gain for our housewares department , which includes television sets and air conditioners , was 103 , ' 0 , " spokesman said . " and I 'm sure all of the gain came from TV and coolers . Usually they make up only about 15% of the floor 's volume , so you can imagine how those two items went up For those two alone , the gain was maybe 600% to 1,000% " The rise in TV sales , the store official explained , came from a strong promotion . The reason for the air conditioning boom , he added , " was obvious . " Volume of the two appliances , he said , boosted housewares to the top of the 15 categories into which his store breaks its sales . " That 's a way above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noted . Men 's wear was almost as strong , according to the merchants . One higher quality store , whose sales gain just equaled that of the city as a whole , said Its most notable inelease was in all types of sportwear . " Men 's wear moved radically in a pre-Father 's Day spurt , " said an executive , " with sportwear a top gift item " Other stores reported similar experiences . The one whose televisimi promotion wa , such a success said only its housewares department topped men 's apparel " Father 's Day helped some . " its spokesman conceded . " but mostly it was the heat . Summer clothing had been in the doldrums , but it got better fast . The gain is especially impressive when you realize that men 's wear sales last year were very good at this tune . " Other Departments Do Well Other departments which did well in most stores were women 's and children 's wear ? generally reported up 7% to 10 ' 0  --  and shoes and fashion accessories . Furniture departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales , although one store reported a sizable ? and inexplicable  --  gain in its regular furniture business . Lagging behind in most cases were fabric , carpeting , . drapery , chin'a and miscellaneous departments . Some fell 20% behind the level of a year before . Merchants disagreed mildly on the effects of Thursday 's flash subway strike , which shut down most service on one of New York 's three lines and seriously affected another . Stores not served directly by subway , of course , discounted it . Another , with an express stop less than a block away , said : " It probably hurt our main store , but may have increased sales in our branches within the city . " A large Brooklyn store , however , believed the walkout had cost it many sales dollars . " If it had n't been for the strike , " a spokesman asserted . " we 'd " have been 10% to 15% ahead of last year As it was , we were about in line with the city average . It did n't just cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on Friday because of the uncertainty about what would happen . " Sales of the ' reporting major department stores in the four weeks ended Saturday , the Reserve Bank said , were 6% above those for the corresponding period of 1955.
