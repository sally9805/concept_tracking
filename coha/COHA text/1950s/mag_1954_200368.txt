Man of the Year <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations . . . Few will disapprove of your choice of Man of the Year TIME , Jan. 4 . Brave old Konrad Adenauer has shown us , by his determined stand against the twin evils of Communism and Naziism , that he is truly one of the greatest men of our age . <P> <P> JAMES D. HAGAN <P> Pittsburgh Sir : Your choice was a logical one . Only a man with such driving spirit and high ideals could have lifted a nation from the doldrums of depression and put it in the forefront of a struggling world-truly a great man . <P> <P> GEORGE B. GOMES Georgetown , British Guiana <P> Sir : Allow me to congratulate you on your cover ... To my mind it transcends in force , symbolism , and warning the famous " Dropping the Pilot " cartoon of Bismarck 's time . <P> In 1909 ... I married a beautiful but dumb member of one of Germany 's best cartel families-pure bourgeois and pure Prussian . Contact with the average middle-class German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a study of history and of international relations . At that time the average German people suffered from a fanatical inferiority complex owing to the fact that , historically , they came on the scene too late to grab choice colonies . . . <P> It was obvious then ( and it is still true ) that though they can stoop to conquer , they will hate the whole world till they can dominate it ... <P> While shuddering for my children , I am , at 65 , glad that I shall not live in the shade of that newly sprouting oak on your cover . <P> <P> DOROTHY CABOT BEST Encino , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> ... I missed treatment of the subject of the moral rehabilitation of Germany . Before we can affirm or negate that the re-emergence of Germany during 1953 has changed the world picture , we have to assess whether some of the fundamental issues have been met by Adenauer 's Germany . . . <P> <P> KURT R. GROSSMANN <P> Kew Gardens , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly that it was the German army and not the German people that capitulated , adding somewhat sinisterly , " and the world had better remember . " The last time we heard that tune was when the man no German ever mentions nowadays proclaimed to a hysterical following that in 1918 it was the German people and not the German army that had surrendered . . . Do n't let us in for a fit of collective amnesia again like after 1918 . <P> <P> CHARLES MARGRY Paris <P> Sir : <P> I am one of the foreign students in the U.S. from Nigeria , West Africa ... A statement made by Chancellor Adenauer runs thus : " We are not an African tribe , but a Central European nation proud of its country " . . <P> Who taught the Chancellor that the African tribesmen are not proud of their country ? ... I know that Chancellor Adenauer will make a good leader in Germany , but I suggest he minds how he uses words when he is in an angry mood . . . <P> <P> MATTHEW CHINENYE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' 53 <P> Sir : <P> An Oscar to your review , " Business in 1953 " TIME , Jan. 4 . An economic masterpiece , well within the grasp of the ordinary layman . A concrete answer to the perpetual peddlers of panic , who continually attempt to sell America short . . . <P> <P> DICK COFFIN <P> Winthrop , Mass . <P> Occupational Bugaboo
