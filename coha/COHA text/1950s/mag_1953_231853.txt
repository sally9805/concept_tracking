Color television , the shore dimly seen , broke into the clear last week when the Federal Communications Commission announced it would authorize a new compatible color system which can be received in black &; white on existing TV sets . <P> The announcement is not the final word . The FCC will hear any objections until Sept. 8 , but the big networks and set manufacturers seem agreed that the time and the system are right . Although the method is the product of the three-year-old National Television System Committee , a technical group representing most of the major manufacturers , the victory is RCA 's . Its " dot sequential " color system lost out to CBS 's noncompatible " field sequential " system in 1950 , but a 1951 defense order halting color-set production gave the N.T.S.C . time to perfect its own method . <P> If there is no opposition , the FCC 's final adoption announcement ( probably before the end of the year ) will be the signal for full-scale manufacture of color sets , perhaps with some on the market within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the earliest models , but mass production is expected to bring prices down to 25-50% above the cost of comparable black &; white sets . By the end of 1954 , color TV ought to be available . Both CBS and RCA plan to start sample color telecasts this year .
