During the first U.S. observance of Law Day last week , American Bar Association President Charles Rhyne appeared at Duke University , made a strong argument for a world rule of law . " War with Russia , " said the A.B.A. 's Rhyne ( TIME , May 5 ) , " is as certain as tomorrow 's sunrise unless a formula or mechanism can be developed to maintain peace other than through arms .

Rogers , referring to current congressional attempts to limit jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court ( see The Congress ) : " There have been periods in our history when the ' kill the umpire ' attitude made considerable headway , and many pop bottles have been thrown at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , the legislature has never taken these attacks seriously enough to alter the judicial system or retaliate against the judiciary . " <P> New York 's Democratic Governor Averell Harriman , no lawyer , turning full face against a fellow Democrat . Arkansas ' Governor Orval Faubus : " Ours is a nation founded upon the rule of law . It is shocking to see a governor of one of the states calling out the National Guard , not to uphold the Constitution and orders of the Supreme Court but to defy them . Such action can not be tolerated . It offends the concept of law on which our society is based . " <P> Kansas ' District Judge Beryl R.

Kaufman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking at Fordham University Law School : " The space age promises to require far greater concessions of national sovereignty to international control and regulation . Earth satellites are circling the globe now in about the same time that it takes to get from Brooklyn to The Bronx by subway. * Since Sputnik , the question ' How high is up ? ' has taken on vast new significance . While historically sovereign jurisdiction extends to the air above the land , it would be totally unfeasible for such jurisdiction to extend to outer space . International control will be imperative . " <P> * Actual subway time from Brooklyn to The Bronx : one hour and 20 minutes . Actual running time of Russia 's Sputnik I : one hour and 36.2 minutes .
