Page 44 , Column 1 CITY TAX RISE BILLS READY FOR ALBANY // gram was the proposed increase in the , tax on gross receipts of general business . He declared that denial of the increase and failure to provide an adequate substitute levy would compel the city to ask for continuance of the sales tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed new or increased taxes the Mayor declared that the city had no intention of using the enabling legislation to obtain ? revenue in. excess of the aniount it asserts is ' needed to balance its budget for fiscal 1952-53 . The amount of new taxes needed by the city , he said , dipends upon the fate of the county real estate tax proposal and the amount of additional state aid granted the city . The Mayor and Controller Lazarus Joseph are scheduled to depart for Albany tomorrow morning to confer with legislative leaders and representatives of Governor Dewey on the city 's fiscal program . They will be accompanied by a small group of fiscal and budgetary advisers including Abraham D. Hearne , assistant budget director ; Julius Wolff , chief accountant in Mr. Joseph 's office ; and Victor F. Condetilo , the Mayor 's legislative representative at Albany . Declines to Defer Trip It was reported that the Mayor was advised late last week to defer his trip until the legislative leaders had had a chance to study the city 's entire program but insisted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the city 's proposals . In well-informed circles it is be lieved that the Board of Estimatd will eventually have to ask for power to continue the 3 per cent sales tax . This belie : is based upon the expectation that the eity will probably get authority for the proposed county real estate tax but will obtain no increase in the tax on gross receipts of general business and at most about $5e 000,000 of additional state aid instead of the requested $63,800,000 . The requests for other new or increased local taxing power will face hard going at Albany , although several of them are given a chance of approval . For example , it is believed that the parimutuel tax may be restored to the 5 per cent level and the proposed cigarette tax authorized . The proposed overnight parking fee is also said to have a fighting chance .
