NATO Headlines rarely surround the meetings of the foreign ministers of the 15 NATO nations who often seem to be the talking , as opposed to the military , branch of NATO . But as the foreign ministers gathered in Paris this week , a rare expectancy was in the air . NATO 's leading nation had at last accepted the proposition put forward long ago by Canada 's " Mike " Pearson and Italy 's Giovanni Gronchi-that NATO should broaden its strictly military base and serve as the free world 's chosen instrument in politics and economics . <P> Beyond accepting this premise , John Foster Dulles himself seemed a little vague on what was to be done ( TIME , April 30 ) , talked of his willingness to listen , and had no blueprints . Even so , the U.S. change of course was important and welcome . It came at a time when many NATO nations are regretful about the retirement ( in November ) of General Al Gruenther , discouraged at the disunity among partners caused by issues such as Cyprus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing conviction that war is not just around the corner . <P> The U.S. long held back from the shift it has now made , because it was convinced that NATO is not the best grouping to deal with economic matters . The OEEC ( Organization for European Economic Cooperation ) includes the same Western European nations , and , in addition , the two important trading nations , Switzerland and Sweden , who as neutrals have no desire to join NATO . Other nations have reservations about grandiose plans to offer aid to underdeveloped countries through NATO . Said one French official : " For these nations , NATO is a soldiers ' club . Any government of an underdeveloped country accepting aid from it would have come in for heavy attack from its left-wing opposition . " <P> But what prevailed over these misgivings was a universal feeling that NATO needs a new lift to face a changing world . It may not be the best combination of nations for its new tasks , but it is the only cluster of Western powers that has real meaning for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they have sworn their vows of fealty to the West , and , just as important , the one place where the U.S. has by solemn treaty pledged to them its strength and support .
