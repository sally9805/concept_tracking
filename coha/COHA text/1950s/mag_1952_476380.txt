Two-Income Families To the Editors : I enjoyed reading " The Two-Income Family " by Mrs. Mavity in the December Harper 's but , except in the case of the professional woman with great or potential ability , I think we can not generalize to this extent . Where need exists , it can be assumed , I think , that the red-blooded mother will take a job if she can really ease housing costs , satisfy the maw of the Supermarket , etc. , and cover her extra working expenses . There is a good chance that a professionally trained mother can provide extra material advantages . . . . But what about the intangibles ? ... In how many places are good childcare centers available , where young children can spend the day and others go directly from school ? I understand " job satisfaction , " the need of the mother for recreation , and the restlessness involved in waiting for the man to " make good , " but does n't the family need this woman as its navigator over these stormy seas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that if women with average or mediocre earning ability would stay out of competition in the business world , except in case of need , young men would find it easier to get a start , possibly earlier developing the necessary " one income . " Let 's not knuckle under to this fetish of job-holding for mothers generally .... II " being easier to get along with " and " not having to stick around the house " seem worth it to her and her husband , I do not believe that it is worth it to the children . To the Editors : Mrs. Mavity has done well for the pro side of " The Two-Income Family , " but she has left much unsaid . The enthusiastic young couples she quotes could well be matched by others ( such as my wife and me ) who are singing hallelujahs that the days of financial necessity which compelled for a time two-income living have passed . Because we went through this period for two years when I , as a beginning newspaperman , was starting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for a house and children , I have no argument with two jobs per couple as a temporary and necessary expedient . But Mrs. Mavity seems to imply that the whole social structure is changing to the extent that the two-income family expects to be one permanently . She attributes this to the fact that the average white-collar pay check is n't enough to support a a family any more . This simply is not the case . Government statistics will show that the rise in living costs over the last ten or twelve years has been pretty well matched by the rise in personal income . What Mrs. Mavity means is that too many young couples have become accustomed to living on a material scale which their parents never knew even in the giddy nineteen-twenties . And they are n't willing to give up the second job because it means giving up the television set and trading the 1951 Pontiac for a 1947 Ford . My wife and I were not unhappy two or three years ago when we had five times as much money in the bank as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two jobs , and a permanent baby sitter . But now that my typically " inadequate " whitecollar salary has risen to around $4,500 a year , now that we have two children , our own new if modestfive-room home , and the 1947 Ford but no television , now we rejoice with exceeding great gladness that it is over a year since the wife and mother in this family has been obliged to meet an early bus five mornings a week . Perhaps I 'm the old-fashioned type who wo n't do any housework ? No indeed . My wife works harder raising two lively boys than I do writing headlines ( or than she would in her profession ) ; so I am able and willing to do a washing or so each week as well as the largest part of the housecleaning . .. JOHN HAWKS SCHMIDT Des Moines , Ia . To the Editors : I am so violently agitated by Mrs. Mavity 's article in the December issue that I can not take time to do an adequate research job in order to refute just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the areas that provide them offer a satisfactory solution to the outstanding problem of the low-income family . " Every child-care center that I know anything about , and I am acquainted with those in New York City and ' . Westchester County , is inadequately staffed and poorly equipped . State funds to maintain them are not only grossly insufficient but are equivocal from year to year as to whether they will be forthcoming or not . . The crying need , as expressed by educators all over the country , is for child-care centers that will really take care of children in terms of supervision and nourishment both emotional and physical . There is an unspeakable dearth of such centers and no competent plans to provide them .... I 'm very much afraid LETTERS that the only two-income family that benefits financially because Mama is a job-holder is the one , like that of Mrs. Mavity 's daughter , in which Mama is a professional woman making more than $75 a week .. .. EVELYN T. LOWENSTEIN Scarsdale , N. Y. - To the Editors : I never write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends because of a single article therein . The December Harper 's has broken both rules . Nancy Barr Mavity 's " The Two-Income Family " is one of the best written , cogently put , much needed articles I 've read anywhere . And my husband in Tokyo is the first recipient on my list of people to get it . DELLE W. PERRY Stanford , Calif . To the Editors : The article , " Two-Income Family , " in your December issue is really a gem . Mrs. Mavity certainly gives a big boost to a society which is contrary to all standards , ethics , etc. , which Western civilization has practiced and protected from those who attempted to change it during its thousands of years of existence . . . Woe to Western civilization and especially to the family unit as we know it ? for it is the huh around which our civilization revolves , and when that is gone everything is gone ? if such thoughts as are expressed , and evidently supported , by Mrs. Mavity ever become universally accepted by society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ford Foundation To the Editors ; I was unable to believe the piece on the Ford Foundation in your December issue , both on account of extrinsic evidence and on account of intrinsic implausibility . Anyone who knows about the history of the two large older foundations ( Rockefeller and Carnegie ) knows that the most successful service rendered by those twp fortunes were the things spoken of by your writer , the development of medicine ment of libraries by Carnegie . Anyone who knows this history knows also what your writer does not say , namely , that both of these accomplishments provoked , at their inception , the same kind of criticism attributed by you to the by-passed university officials of today . . . . As to the article itself , all of my experience makes it unbelievable that the New York staff of the Ford Foundation works with humility and earnestness , whereas the " sages of Pasadena " operate with arrogance and pretension to God-like wisdom , It is far more believable that the humility of the working staff stems from a similar humility at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed suitors must be highly suspect . More than this , I should have supposed that common journalistic decency would have required some direct opportunity for the men in Pasadena to have made their own reply . If your writer wished to condemn them , why did n't he go see them ? .. . LYNN A. WILLIAMs Chicago , III . To the Editors : Apropos of Mr. Heilbroner 's article on the Ford Foundation and its curious relationship to the Ford Motor Company December , your readers may be interested in the fact that in an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer for December 17 , 1951 , signed by E. S. Banks , the financial editor , Benson Ford was quoted as saying that Ford Motor Co. profits would be lower this year than last ; and the article continued : He remarked smilingly that Ford Motor ' at least does n't have to worry about paying a dividend . We could pass it without any complaint from anyone , although the chances are that we wo n't , even though the dividend may turn out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of stockholders ? just the members of the family and the Ford Foundation ? ' and the Foundation owns 93 per cent of the stock . ' " HORACE KNOWLES Philadelphia , Pa . The Knife 's Edge To the Editors : Mr. DeVoto 's " Easy Chair " is a source of much enjoyment to me , informative and sometimes provocative . In the November issue concerning kitchen knives , I wonder if he has had any experience with Sheffield steel such as I have when he mourns for it and bemoans the imposition on the housewife of the present manufacturers of stainless knives . I inherited twelve Sheffield steel steak knives when starting housekeeping twenty-seven years ago , plus three sets of carving knives and forks . Each instrument requires sharpening and scouring after use unless one wants to face a darkened , discolored steel . My husband rebelled finally on the carving sets for they would hardly hold an edge through carving , although I am considered a good cook and do not feel it was due to tough beef . We settled for an excellent stainless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use but requires no scouring . It will hold an edge through several roasts if one is careful not to put it in with all the other tableware but to wipe separately and protect the edge in a drawer away from other articles . . . The only redeeming quality of the Sheffield as I see it is their durability through constant sharpening and endless scouring . As My father remarked fifteen years ago while scouring them , " I scoured these for my mother in Scotland when I was eight years old . I did not think I would do it again when eighty . " Give me the modern stainless steel every time . Its luster contributes to easier housework for the housewife who cares for her own kitchen utensils and saves endless hours and cans of scouring powder . JEAN B. COCHRAN Spokane , Wash . Cave Men &; Primitives To the Editors : As ' an admirer of attempts at " cross-fertilization " among the sciences , it was with utter horror that I read Mr. Fry 's " A Kind Word for the Cave Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning his right to . put cartoonists on the spot ( especially in such a humorous manner ) , I think anthropologists would turn pale at Mr. Fry 's misunderstanding of their science . The idea that modern " primitives " can be taken as representative of our own " cave man " ancestors has been a dead duck in anthropology for years . But worse than that , the implication that the behavior of " primitives " is any more innate , biological , or apelike than our own has been proved false so many times that it is no longer considered worthy of discussion among anthropologists . JEAN H. ROGERS Albuquerque , N. M. For the Record To the Editors : In the article on " Arnold , Fortas , Porter &; Prosperity " in your November issue , by Louis Cassels , there were two mistakes to which I wish to call your attention . The Kiefer-Stewart Company was referred to as an Ohio corporation . It is an Indiana corporation , Ill years old , that has an Indiana Wholesale Liquor Dealer 's permit . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with " maximum " prices , which are quite another matter . The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in the case of " Kiefer-Stewart Company vs . Seagram et al " makes this clear . This was the first time the Court had had an opportunity to pass on the legality of fixing " maximum " prices . A. KIEFER MAYER , Vice President Kiefer-Stewart Company Indianapolis , Ind . Walking Rabbits To the Editors : In his article on " North to Find Iron " in your December issue , describing the Indians going out fur hunting , John Bartlow Martin says : " If they do n't hit caribou , they starve . . . . They can exist on rabbit but they ca n't work on it ? there 's no nourishment in rabbit , they ca n't walk . " I ca n't argue with Mr. Martin because he has me totally confused . Does he mean the rabbit can not walk ? If he 's referring to the natives I disagree ; his diagnosis is completely off . In that case Californians ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow readers ' , here is a comparadye composition of rabbit meat and beef , based on tests reported by Dorthy B. Darling and Hugo W.

I live in Oklahoma in a Cape Cod house . JANE HOWE Norman , OkIa . Nurses ' Needs To the Editors : The story " The Black Mollies " by Sloan Wilson December was beautifully done . I have always felt that parents should be allowed to stay with their children in hospitals . The screams and crying of children too young to understand that they have not been abandoned is surely a heartbreaking sound ? and certainly very damaging psychologically . But the author has only one slant on what 's really wrong with the situation . Most nurses would like to take time to give affection and comfort to the children on their wards , but they are bound and trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse is not only paid a fantastically low wage , but she must combine heavy physical labor with mental strain and great responsibility .... How about private citizens looking into the finances of local hospitals ... and the standards of local nurses ' training schools ? . .. You 'll attract the kind of nurses you want to take care of your children only if you give them a little support . DORIS BRADLEY R.N. Berkeley , Calif.
