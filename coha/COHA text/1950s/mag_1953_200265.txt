With a furious beating of pressagents. ' drums ( including the mailing of a million letters and the dispatch to radio executives of 3,000 vials of water from Florida 's Fountain of Youth ) , NBC last week dropped a $5,000,000 blockbuster in the form of 28 new or revamped radio shows . The man tossing the bomb ( target : public apathy about radio ) is NBC 's go-getting Vice President Ted Cott , 36 , who arrived at the " Magic 28 " after three weeks of all-out cerebration with his NBC associates . <P> Cott does not think that sponsors will come flocking overnight to pick up the tabs , but he hopes to convince enough of them that radio has a vast audience ( including the motorized public ) that television does not touch . " I do n't expect to get anyone to turn off TV , " he says . " My concern is that radio has n't done anything to make people responsive to it . We expect to be the most aggressive radio network , and we think it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forcing them to put on better shows . " <P> NBC daytime radio , including soap operas , has scarcely felt a tremor from the Cott bomb . Biggest upheaval comes on Sunday when a long parade of shows-long on drama , short on comedy-presents big stars , e.g. , Helen Hayes , Fredric March , Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer rotating on hosting NBC Star Playhouse , Sir Laurence Olivier in The Royal Theater , Jimmy Stewart in Six Shooter , Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in The Marriage . The most original of the 28 : <P> Weekend ( Sun . 4 p.m. ) splices together a lot of tape and reels it out as a two-hour " Sunday newspaper of the air . " Its 15-minute " pages " cover everything from world news to criticism of the arts , call in some well-known name droppers . Tex McCrary interviews celebrities , and Jinx runs a woman 's page , Mel Allen talks sports , Elmo Roper talks trends , Florabel Muir ( see PRESS ) gushes from Hollywood , Earl Wilson gives Broadway lowdown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a generally relaxed manner and skillful transitions make it well worth hearing . <P> Stroke of Fate ( Sun . 9 p.m. ) poses some intriguing iffy questions about history . First question : " What might have happened if Robert E. Lee had accepted Lincoln 's offer to command the Union Army ? " After consultation with Columbia Historian Allan Nevins , veteran Radio-TV Writer Mort Lewis decided that Lee 's generalship would have ended the Civil War two years sooner , thus leading to an earlier assassination of Lincoln and Lee 's election as President . Other Stroke of Fate teasers : Suppose Montcalm had defeated Wolfe at Quebec , Hamilton had killed Burr in their duel , Hitler had been killed in the Munich beer-hall Putsch ? The program 's solid grounding in historical fact ( Nevins and Historian Stefan Lorant are regular advisers ) and able dramatizations give it plausibility and high marks for entertainment .
