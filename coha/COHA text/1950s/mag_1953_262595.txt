Niagara ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a thin trickle of melodrama with a Niagara Falls setting . The picture casts Marilyn Mon roe as a curvaceous tramp who plots to murder her husband ( Joseph Gotten ) . <P> When the plan backfires , Marilyn and her lover ( Richard Allan ) wind up dead at the hands of the husband , who takes his punishment by going over the falls in a drifting boat . <P> A cut &; dried thriller , Niagara allows Marilyn Monroe to parade about in revealing negligees and to take a shower in silhouette . But this is just about the full range of her performance . The picture 's outstanding feature : the Technicolored shots of the thundering falls . <P> The Tall Texan ( Lippert ) is a short-order horse opera about a group of as sorted characters lusting for gold and a woman in the wide open spaces of the old West . After approximately an hour of gunplay , almost everyone is killed off , except the girl ( Marie Windsor ) and a strong , silent type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Of some interest to western fans may be the weird New Mexican rock formations that abound in the film .
