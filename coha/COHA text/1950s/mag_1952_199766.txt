The Grey-Eyed People ( by John D. Hess ) was a two-tone play whose colors brutally clashed . It told of a suburban individualist who staged a hot-tempered crusade on behalf of a former Communist who ran afoul of the community . Part of the time the author-a veteran TV writer-seemed concerned with a pressing contemporary situation . The rest of the time he merely seemed concerned with what it could yield in laughs . <P> Some of his gags were clever enough , some of his scenes had the right farcical commotion for a different kind of play , and in Walter Matthau he had an engaging leading man . But the play , which closed at week 's end after five performances , was far from expert on its own terms , and its terms were a little shabby anyhow . Playwright Hess seemed to have chosen his theme for no better reason than that it is in the air right now , and to have handled it as though it were going on the air .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
