If the Montreal Canadiens fail to win the National Hockey League race that is just getting warmly under way , they will know something of the embarrassment suffered by Thomas E. Dewey on that autumn morning in 1948 . Dewey could n't lose , and neither can the 1958-59 Canadiens . The other coaches in the league have already conceded the title to Hector ( Toe ) Blake 's swift pupils ; the opposing teams are just scrapping for a crack at Montreal in the Stanley Cup playoffs . " This is the best hockey team in the world , " says Frank Selke , managing director of the Canadiens , " the strongest I have had in 12 years at Montreal . " // The Dewey analogy is not used to imply that a miracle will happen  --  but only to emphasize the lead Montreal has piled up in hockey opinion polls . There was no need to call in Dr. Gallup . Everybody favors Maurice Richard &amp; Co. // Richard , " The Rocket "  --  the Ruth , the Dempsey , the Tilden of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implausibly old age of 37 . This is an age at which most hockey players ( retired , of course ) do well to keep up with a well-oiled perambulator ; but Richard , as Toe Blake says , " is not like the rest of us . " French Canadians , who revere The Rocket , say he possesses le feu sacr ? . This sacred fire  --  or whatever you wish to call the unearthly intensity Richard brings to hockey  --  is kindling again on schedule . // It is n't just the inspiriting presence of the great right wing that makes Montreal so formidable . The other superstars  --  Beliveau , Geoffrion , Harvey  --  are sound ; The Rocket 's kid brother Henri , one of the fastest and most stylish players in the game , returns at center ; the league scoring champion , Left Wing Dickie Moore , has taken the cast off his broken hand ; Jacques Plante 's in goal ; and all 's right with the Canadiens . They won last season 's title by 19 points despite a wave of ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrion ( bowel rupture ) and almost ended The Rocket 's career ( damaged Achilles ' tendon ) . What a healthy team will do is frightening , or exhilarating , to contemplate , depending on your leanings . // This is not to say that the Canadiens will march routinely and dully to the championship . Seventy games make a long season ; like the Yankees , the Canadiens will lose a few and will have to struggle to win others . The sport itself is so fast , the action so rugged and the scoring so close that the customers will have plenty to cheer about , even if their own teams can not hope to win the title . // What 's more , the opposition should be noticeably stronger this season . The dogfight among New York , Detroit , Boston , Chicago and Toronto for the three Stanley Cup playoff berths ( besides Montreal 's ) should be a notably close and vigorous one . // Keen attention will be paid to New York 's new kid team , so called because the Rangers let some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngsters . Second in the league last season with a curious mixture of stars and clods , New York is gambling heavily upon five rookies . The most promising among them is a hard-nosed , 21-year-old 190-pound left wing from Sudbury , Ont. named Eddie Shack . Shack , sort of a mean Li'l Abner , is always getting his big nose into trouble , to the unspeakable delight of Coach Phil Watson . Called up from the Providence club , for whom he got 16 goals in 35 games last year , Shack opened a 10-stitch cut in an opponent in an exhibition-game brawl and was bailed out of jail after carrying the fight into the stands . // Elsewhere in the league there has been some reshuffling of veterans , and there are other experiments involving rookies . Chicago is making an especially strong bid to become a cup contender . The Black Hawks got out of the cellar last season as Toronto slipped down ; new blood , including two rugged defensemen  --  Dollard St. Laurent , bought from Montreal , and Al Arbour , from Detroit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has Gordie Howe , probably the best all-round forward in hockey , but not enough other bodies to menace the Canadiens . Fourth-place Boston , with the big roughhouse team that gave Montreal some bad moments in the playoff finals , is , by and large , standing pat . Toronto has picked up the Canadiens ' aging but presumably still resourceful playmaker , Bert Olmstead , and has visions of a third-or even second-place finish . // THE MINORS // As the majors face off , another set of fans is saluting the start of a companion season , that of hockey 's far-flung minor leagues . There are five in all in the U.S. and Canada . At the highest level is the American Hockey League , with teams in Buffalo , Cleveland , Hershey , Providence , Rochester and Springfield . A notch below are the nine-team Western League , predominantly Canadian ( Calgary , Edmonton , Saskatoon , Winnipeg , New Westminster , Victoria , Vancouver , Seattle , Spokane ) , and the four-team Quebec League ( Montreal Royals , Quebec , Three Rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League , with seven teams in the eastern U.S. ( Clinton , N.Y. ; Charlotte , N.C. ; Washington , D.C. ; Johnstown , Pa. ; Philadelphia ; New Haven , Conn. ; Commack , N.Y. ) , and the International League , with five teams in the Midwest ( Louisville ; Indianapolis ; Troy , Ohio ; Toledo ; Fort Wayne , Ind. ) . // Although most of the minor league teams are independently owned , they serve as farm teams for the National Hockey League , the one major league in hockey . NHL teams may draft players from the American , Western and Quebec leagues ; the American League in turn may draft from the Western and Quebec leagues . The other two leagues , however , have no such formal draft arrangements . // The usual affiliation between an NHL team and one or more minors is that of a working agreement which permits an interchange of players during the season that is apart from the off-season draft . An important exception is Montreal , which owns the Montreal Royals of the Quebec League outright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American League . // You remember Montreal ? The Canadiens ? Ah , yes . They 're in . Ca n't lose .
