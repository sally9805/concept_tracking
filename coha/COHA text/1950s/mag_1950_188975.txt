THE PEABODY SISTERS OF SALEM ( 372 pp. ) - Louise Hall Tharp-Little , Brown ( $4 ) . <P> <P> Poor " Lizzie " Peabody . " Busybody " might have been a better name . She was such a congenital , selfless do-gooder , almost too perfect a distaff product of New England 's 19th Century intellectual flowering . As a child of four in Salem , Mass. , she was already envious of Neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne 's sister Ebe , who was six and reading Shakespeare . Twenty-nine years later ( 1837 ) when future brother-in-law Nathaniel published his Twice-Told Tales , Liz sang his praises so busily that Hawthorne got tired of her . Once during the Civil War when Liz decided that Abraham Lincoln was running the war badly , she rushed off to Washington to tell him so . Satisfied that Mr. Lincoln was really the man for the job , she directed her energies into good works for distressed Negro children . At 66 , Spinster Liz started the nation 's first public kindergarten . She was past 80 when she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 90 when she died , her mind busy with women 's emancipation and machinery for world peace . <P> Resolute Lizzie dominates The Peabody Sisters of Salem , a Book-of-the-Month Club selection for January , just as she tried to dominate her friends and family . Housewife-Author Louise Hall Tharp , whose previous books , have been juveniles , has carefully apportioned each Peabody girl her due in a three-figure biography that shuttles from sister to sister and becomes in the end a kind of trellis for most of the blooms of the Yankee flowering . Emerson , Alcott , Channing , Margaret Fuller , Thoreau and most of the others pop up in this book with the naturalness of neighbors dropping in to borrow a copy of the Boston Transcript . Mrs. Tharp 's greatest charm is " that she loves and respects her gallery of famous individualists but is never awed by them . What she has to say about them is closer to kitchen common sense than to scholarly penetration ; in this portrait they are seen with their transcendentalism down . <P> Passes at Horace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Peabody held her head high because her family had once been rich , though now she had to roll back the parlor rug and teach the neighbors ' children when she was n't brought to bed with her own ( she also bore three sons and another daughter who died in infancy ) . Father Nathaniel was a dentist , a kindly potterer and whittler who never learned how to stand up to his energetic womenfolk . By any standards of the day , his daughters made their marks . <P> <P> Beautiful Sophia was the youngest , reared by her mother as a fragile invalid only to shed her ailment when handsome Nathaniel Hawthorne made her his wife . The second sister , Mary , was the quiet one who married famed Educator Horace Mann-but only after sister Liz had made maidenly passes at Horace which included combing his hair . Liz never did get the men she coveted at various times of her long life , though one suitor seems to have committed suicide when Liz decided that he " was not sound-minded nor well-principled.
