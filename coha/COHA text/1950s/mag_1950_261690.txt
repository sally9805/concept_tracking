<P> If any one emotion dominated the mind of Master Sergeant Elmer C. Bender when he crawled out of his bunk on the morning of October 19 , 1948 , it was boredom . The sergeant , a debonair , dark-browed Marine Corps pilot , was at the U.S. Naval base at Tsingtao , China , and the Chinese , it was true , were having themselves some kind of a war only a few miles away . But it was n't Sergeant Bender 's war . He decided to get in a little flying time , asked a big , tousle-headed Navy chief electrician 's mate named William C. Smith to go along for the ride . <P> The two got into a single-engined Stinson monoplane and buzzed off from an airstrip near Tsingtao . They vanished completely . The Navy sent out searching planes . In the months which followed , both the Navy and the State Department repeatedly asked the Chinese Communists for information about them . The Communists simply did not reply . But three weeks ago , after holding them captive for 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the two men on a steamship bound for Hong Kong . <P> Steaks &; Jabs . After that all sorts of improbable things began to happen to them . A U.S. destroyer boiled up alongside the steamship and took them off . A Navy plane flew them from Hong Kong to Pearl Harbor . On arrival they were hustled away to a hospital and supplied with steaks , ice cream , vitamin pills and new uniforms . Doctors tapped and jabbed them ; intelligence officers quizzed them about the world revolution . <P> They were also bombarded by a steady hail of wealth , both real and potential . Smith drew $1,367 in back pay ; Bender more than $3,000 . They began getting dizzying offers ( the Navy estimated that they might split $100,000 ) from publishers , magazines , radio and television companies . When they walked into a glare of newsreel lights at Pearl Harbor for a press conference , they acted as if they had gone through some 20th Century looking glass and into a world where everybody had gone completely , if delightfully , nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuables , they discussed their experiences as reticently as poker players being questioned about a good hand . But it was soon obvious that Communist China too had been a kind of never-never land for them , a place full of benign Oriental maniacs with no respect for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps . <P> The People 's Army had grabbed them almost as soon as they landed-ignominiously out of gas-on a beach near Tsingtao ; to their amazement they were treated simultaneously as prisoners of war and as friends and possible converts . They were marched off to a distant village , but were neither jailed nor put to work . Their guards-soldiers , who " would have made a Marine top sergeant blow his top " - supplied them with rice , gave them fish and meat when it was available . <P> They were taken to Chinese plays and once saw a newsreel-of a May Day parade in Moscow . When the Communists celebrated a victory they even got native corn whisky . " Wow , " said Bender . " We had some bourbon the other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escorted wandering about the village they became hopeless and depressed .
