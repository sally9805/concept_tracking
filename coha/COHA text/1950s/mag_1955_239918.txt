Manhattan 's nightclub world was under the spell of two visiting princesses last week , and their subjects hardly knew where to pay homage first . At the Waldorf-Astoria 's Empire Room , demure Dorothy Dandridge rambled through her slinky-but-sweet songs about love and how to enjoy it . A few blocks away , in the downstairs den known as the Copacabana , petite Eartha Kitt took her listeners on a quadrilingual ( English , French , Spanish , Turkish ) tour over much the same ground , sticking mostly to its back alleys . <P> Resignation &; Command . From bee-stung lips to white-sheathed hips , 32-year-old Dorothy personified topic A. Her warm brown eyes singled out two or three lucky males for what appeared to be a special invitation , and her long , discreetly undulating body lent emphasis to the looks . Some of her songs told a story-about Good for Nothing Joe or Just One of Those Things ; some rekindled the old glories of such sentiments as I Got Rhythm and Easy to Love . Her voice was commonplace , but her poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone was ready to follow her calypso invitation : <P> Never mind the noise in the market Only mind the price of the fish . <P> Remove your nose from the grindstone And do the things you wish . <P> Eartha Kitt , 27 , did not seem the type to ask people to do what they wished-only what she wished . Where Dorothy shimmered in white satin , Eartha smoldered in red bugle beads . Where Dorothy swayed in sweet resignation , Eartha froze and darted her almond eyes . When Eartha sang , it was in a smoky , reedlike quaver . Most of the time she was the fervid , grasping female as she trumpeted C'est Si Bon , Aprs Moi and The Heel . But at the end she often inserted a wistful and not very convincing twist-the manner of the little girl lost in the wicked world . <P> Freud &; Voodoo . Dorothy grew up in a family of entertainers , bowed in Cleveland at the age of five in a family act . Eartha was a South Carolina farmer 's daughter , and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 16 , she knew poverty and had a brush with voodoo ( she still recalls how voodoo charms were found in the mattress after a relative died ) . Both Eartha and Dorothy made their way to the top through the nightclub circuit as singers , but think of themselves primarily as actresses . This season both made big acting hits , Dorothy as Carmen in the movie version of Carmen Jones ( the singing was dubbed in by Marilynn Home ) , Eartha as the impish heroine of Broadway 's Mrs. Patterson . <P> Behind the entertainment whirl , the girls hanker after some intellectual life . Dorothy Dandridge slips into a pink shirt and tight slacks and thinks seriously about her private personality . As a divorcee , she is faced with raising her nine-year-old daughter , has delved into Freud and Norman Vincent Peale to help herself understand the problem .
