Chances for professional opera singers in the U.S. may be slim ( see above ) , but for students in springtime they blossom like daffodils . Last week three U.S. schools offered five modern operas , composed by faculty members and a graduate student and staged by the schools ' opera workshops . All of them were in a conservative idiom , ranging in style from Gilbert &; Sullivan to Menotti . The five : <P> The Birthday of the Infanta , by Ron Nelson , 29 , graduate student at Rochester 's Eastman School of Music , and composer of promotional-film sound tracks . Following Oscar Wilde 's story , a dwarf falls in love with a Spanish princess and persuades her to set up her throne in the forest . The scheme is frustrated by the captain of the guard , and tragedy closes in . The music reminded listeners of both Puccini and Menotti , and suggested that Birthday will have many happy returns . <P> The Rope , by Louis Mennini , 35 , Eastman faculty member and brother of Manhattan Composer Peter Mennin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene O'Neill . An old miser dangles a noose from a barn rafter , hoping his son will hang himself . Instead , the son decides to torture the miser into revealing his money 's hiding place . Composer Mennini spent a summer learning the ins and outs of opera composition at Tanglewood , and used his knowledge well . The rub was the music ; it seemed too charmingly melodious for the gruesome plot . <P> Beyond Belief , by Thomas Canning , 45 , Eastman faculty member and composer of lots of gay , light music . This one is a fantastic satire of the atomic age and all its perils . A group of grey professors discovers the " key to consciousness , " which permits knowledge of the past and future . The problem , complicated by young love , is whether to keep the discovery secret or turn it over to the authorities . Instrumentalists were seated in niches around the stage and played frothy music as the performers spoke and sang . <P> The Land Between the Rivers , by Indiana University 's Associate Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a poem by Yale 's Novelist-Professor Robert Penn Warren ( All the King 's Men ) . It tells of a roistering , 19th century innkeeper on the Cumberland River whose pleasure it is to lead travelers to his spring and then kill and rob them . His son escapes , returns in Act II ( twelve years later ) unrecognized , and allows himself to die under his father 's hatchet . Composer Van Buskirk , who composed his score on piano and tape recorder , gave the orchestra a plaintive parlor-organ quality and the singers some striking dramatic climaxes . <P> Pantaloon , by Manhattan 's Robert Ward , 39 , assistant to the president of Juilliard School of Music . The plot adapted from He Who Gets Slapped by Russian Symbolist Leonid Andreyev , concerns a disturbed fellow who joins a circus as a clown for deep-seated reasons of his own . Composer Ward 's music resembles Mascagni 's , with thick textures sweeping strings and sweet harmonies and thus Pantaloon has the makings of a successful theater piece . Unfortunately , the drama does not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
