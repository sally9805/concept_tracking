Never did a solar eclipse get as much attention as the one of last week . It could be seen-at least partially and weather permitting-by about one-third of the earth 's population . Never was an eclipse so thoroughly observed . <P> At Minneapolis and St. Paul , near the start of the eclipse , the sun rose in a clear sky with a small bite of its bright disk already nibbled away by the moon . Early risers , on roofs or in parks , had a perfect view of totality , with all the weird effects that they had been reading about . But the scientists were taking no chances . One group , led by Dr. Donald Menzel , head of the Harvard College Observatory , took spectroscopic motion pictures from a high-flying Stratocruiser . A task force from the University of Chicago pictured the sun 's glowing corona with a photoelectric scanning device more sensitive than any eye or photographic film . <P> As the shadow of the moon swept northeast into Canada , it ran into more unfavorable weather . On the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Scientists from New York 's American Museum of Natural History had a good observation point in an American Airlines plane that flew above the low clouds and dodged the patchy high ones . <P> As the moon 's shadow raced over Greenland , it was waylaid by Sir Harold Spencer Jones , Britain 's Astronomer Royal and lord of Herstmonceux Castle , now the Royal Observatory . Sir Harold chased the shadow from Greenland to Iceland in an R.A.F. bomber , prolonging his view of totality by 22 seconds as he looked for daylight aurorae . He saw none . <P> Jet View . On swept the shadow at 3,000 m.p.h . The Shetland Islands were covered with storm clouds , but southern Britain was reasonably clear , and millions of Britons saw the partial eclipse . Most spectacular view of totality was from 21 Canberra jet bombers of the R.A.F. , which flew so high ( 50,000 ft. ) that the shadow looked like an oval black shape in the cloud deck far below . <P> Crossing Norway , Sweden and Finland , mostly covered with clouds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observatories , Russian and satellite , were waiting for it . Northern Russia was cloudy , but the weather improved in the south , and stations in the Caucasus had excellent observing . In Iran a U.S. expedition was clouded over , but Father Francis J. Heyden of Georgetown University made up for it partially by winning a $400 rug from Iranian astronomers . They had bet him that the eclipse would not happen at all . <P> Sacred Ponds . In India , which the shadow reached just before sundown , came a kind of climax . For hours before the eclipse , orthodox Hindus had fasted , lest the food in their stomachs be polluted before it could be digested . Pregnant women hid in dark closets . At the sacred ponds of Kurukshetra and Sanyahet , near Delhi , waited 500,000 pilgrims who believed that during a solar eclipse all the sacred rivers of the world would flow into the two ponds , and that to bathe in them at that time would purge the soul of all sins . Since both the ponds were nearly dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brim full . <P> To pious Hindus , a solar eclipse is caused by a demon named Rahu who is only a severed head . He hates the sun because it was instrumental in getting his body removed ; so every now and then he tries to swallow the sun .
