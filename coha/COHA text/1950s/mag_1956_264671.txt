The long-awaited Civil Aeronautics Board decision on the rich New York-to-Miami airline run came last week . To little ( eleven aging DC-3s , six early-model Convairs ) Northeast Airlines ( 1955 net : $379,937 ) went the grandest prize in the CAB bag : permission to fly the " Gold Coast " run , with National and Eastern . <P> Of the seven lines competing for a slice of the world 's best air route , Northeast had one of the weakest claims . A CAB examiner had recommended Delta ; New York City and Baltimore had officially endorsed Pan Am . Northeast 's very weakness , however , turned out to be its strength . It was the only domestic trunk-line still on Government subsidy , receiving $1.8 million from Washington every year , and CAB felt that it had a mandate to get all U.S. airlines off subsidy and flying on their own . <P> <P> The CAB decision was first taken last fortnight by a three-to-two vote , with Republicans Chan Gurney and Harmar Denny in the minority . Ordinarily , the board would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formal order , but word quickly leaked to the " corridor walkers " - the airline lobbyists who have been putting tremendous heat on CAB . Suddenly , Northeast 's ordinarily sluggish shares ( only 249,600 traded in all of 1955 ) zoomed ; in just one day 24,000 were traded , with the stock jumping from 9 to 12 . Finally , as the rumor hit front pages and the lobbyists turned their strongest pressure on CAB to change its mind , the agency quickly convened , in a four-hour meeting clinched the matter by taking the unprecedented step of announcing its decision before issuing a formal order . <P> <P> In the furor over the Northeast decision , newsmen and airline lobbyists missed another CAB ruling that may be even more important . Three days before it voted on Northeast , CAB voted 3-2 , Democrats Joseph Adams and Joseph Minetti dissenting , to give Pan American a New York-Nassau route . With Pan Am already flying between Miami and Nassau , the ruling would , in effect , also bring Pan Am into the New York-Miami run-by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be reversed , new pressures will arise in Washington . The Gold Coast war is not over .
