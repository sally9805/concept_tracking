On Douglas Aircraft Co. , Inc. ' s airport at Santa Monica , Calif. last week , Test Pilot John Martin climbed into the silver belly of the newest Douglas transport , the DC-7 . For an hour , Pilot Martin and his three engineers gave last-minute checks to the 600 dials and indicators in the cockpit and flight engineer 's compartment . Then they sent the huge , four-engine plane scooting along the runway and into the air on its first test flight , while 12,000 Douglas employees around the field set up a cheer . <P> The big plane is much like the DC-6B , but it has its own important differences . The DC-6B 's Pratt &; Whitney 2,500-h.p. engines have been replaced by 3,250-h.p . Wright turbo-compound engines , which use their exhaust jet to turn small turbines . This has stepped up the cruising speed to 365 m.p.h. ( v. 310 in the DC-6Bs ) , making it possible to fly from New York to Los Angeles nonstop in eight hours . The plane has a cruising range of 4,450 miles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonstop . The 69-passenger DC-7 is 40 inches longer than the DC-6B , carries five more passengers . Other features : an air-conditioning system which operates on the ground as well as in the air ; special soundproofing . Douglas already has orders for 58 DC-7s ( 25 each to American and United Airlines , four each to Delta and National ) , will soon begin delivery at $1,700,000 each . <P> Douglas also expects to sell the plane to foreign lines , fears no competition from Britain 's Comet . While the Comet will go faster between stops , Douglas thinks that the DC-7 will beat it in elapsed time because it will not have to make the refueling stops needed by the shorter-range Comet . Douglas is still tight-lipped about its own plans for jet transports , but the DC-7 , says Vice President Arthur Raymond , " is definitely our last piston-type transport of the DC-7 size .
