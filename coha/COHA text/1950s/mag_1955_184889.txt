The Health Ministry provided women with simple sets of beads and showed them how to keep track of the rhythm-green beads for " safe " days , black beads for " baby " days ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) . <P> But last week , after encountering an array of difficulties , Minister Kaur announced ruefully that the bead program had failed . Some women discarded the beads as too similar to those worn by cows . Others , from the depths of their faith in the Health Ministry , believed in the beads as a magic charm against conception . One chief trouble , as it turned out , was too many babies who just loved to play with mother 's beads and disrupt her calculations .
