To Soviet readers , Sherlock Holmes is a great fictional hero , and in the past 40-odd years the U.S.S.R. 's Ministry of Culture has grossed at least $3,000,000 in sales of the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , creator of Holmes . But neither Doyle nor his heirs ever got so much as a ruble out of the Soviet sales . A Moscow city court last year tossed out a $180,000 suit brought by Adrian Conan Doyle , Sir Arthur 's only surviving son , as a claim for the pirating of his father 's writing .

His explanation ( sounding almost as if it had been composed by Columnist Leonard Lyons ) : " It is well known that there are only two Rolls-Royces in the whole of Yugoslavia , and both belong to Marshal <P> Tito . Clearly , your motorcyclists thought they must have crashed into the car of our great leader ! " <P> <P> Britain 's Princess Margaret , an all-too-eligible bachelor girl , turned 29 , was greeted by Britain 's press with heartfelt congratulations and a bit of " will-she-ever " worry .

An orchid corsage , ordered by cable from the U.S. , was delivered by a local florist , who refused to name the donor . <P> Every centimeter an equestrienne on her white mount , Yasmin Khan , 9 , daughter of Aly Khan and Cinemactress Rita Hay worth , displayed some reinless riding form in the posh French seaside resort of Deauville .
