A fine old Dutch custom ( when the winter ice is firm enough ) is to stage a skating race , point to point , through towns of the northern Netherlands . Last week , proud of the synagogues restored or newly built since the end of Nazi occupation , Dutch Jews staged a variant : a synagogue auto rally , point to point . <P> Speed was not the main object . Each of 113 driver-passenger teams drew meticulous instructions ( as in the game of treasure hunt ) for checking in at hard-to-spot " control " and " inquisition " points as well as visiting synagogues along the way . At each control point , teams had to perform some action correctly : waving a handkerchief , snatching a brass ring while driving at 9 m.p.h. , buying a stick of candy ( but drivers who sneaked a lick en route had it scored against them ) . At each of five inquisition points , teams had to answer a question . The questions : 1 ) When was the state of Israel founded ? 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many candles are there in Hanukah lights ? 4 ) What is the difference between Kiddush and Kaddish ? 5 ) How many keys are there on a piano ? * <P> End of the rally was a banquet for 500 sponsored by Haarlem 's Jewish Recreation Association , where the winners were announced : Driver Gerard van Praag and Passenger Max Gosschalk , in a German Volkswagen , who had only 36 points against them all day . <P> <P> * r ) The answers : 1 ) May 14 , 1948 ; 2 ) Ben-Zvi ; 3 ) nine : 4 ) Kiddush is a consecration of the Sabbath over wine , and Kaddish is a prayer in memory of the dead ; 5 ) 88 . Commonest error : David Ben-Gurion for Isaac Ben-Zvi.
