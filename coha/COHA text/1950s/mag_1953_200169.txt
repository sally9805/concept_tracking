In her glorious old imperialist days , England exported her national sport so fervently that the sun never set on cricket. * The ones who learned cricket best , England discovered to her sorrow , were the sturdy Australians . After England 's second loss to the Aussies , the despondent London Sporting Times wrote : " English cricket . . . died at the oval , Aug. 29 , 1882 . . . The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia . " The Ashes eventually became the invisible symbol of victory in the matches . For the last 20 years , down-under cricketers have held on to the Ashes . Last week long-humiliated England saw a chance to win them back . <P> Of the current rubber 's five matches , four had been draws . Thus everything rested on the fifth . Twenty-four hours before it began , a wave of hope far wilder than ever gripped a partisan World Series crowd in the U.S. swept Britain . Queues lengthened outside London 's Kennington Oval . Intoned the London Times : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands with bated breath . " <P> Winning the toss , Australia chose to bat first . In cricket , as in baseball , the best batsmen lead off the order . To England 's joy , the Aussies ' best were quickly put out . But then Australia 's " tail wagged " ; her weaker batsmen managed to build their team 's total to a respectable 275 runs before their tenth and last wicket fell ( i.e. , the side was retired on the equivalent of three baseball outs ) . Then England batted , scoring 306 runs to gain a lead of 31 on the first of the match 's two innings . On the third day , with Australia up at bat again , England 's bowlers tore into Australia , putting them out for a measly 162 . Triumph for England was only 132 runs away , and before dark her batsmen got 38 of them , for the loss of only one wicket . Ninety-four to go . <P> British sportswriters made remarkably uncricket exhibitions of themselves . Wrote the Daily Mirror 's Peter Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . We took them neck and crop , bag and baggage , hip and thigh , skin and bone , and we bundled them out . . . " Retorted an Aussie writer : " No trumpets yet , England ! " <P> As the final day dawned , even London 's Communist Daily Worker stopped scowling at capitalists long enough to huzzah : <P> <P> " A wonderful day for England ! " Gritted the Daily Herald : " Cricket is , of course , only a game . So is climbing Mount Everest . But how this nation needs those runs . " <P> With snail-like caution , England resumed batting . The bowled balls bounced crazily off the now-frayed turf . In the early afternoon , some 25,000 tautly silent fans watched the Aussies claim another wicket-their last . At 2:53 p.m. , England 's Denis Compton swatted the winning run . <P> The crowds surged onto the field , trying hard to keep their cricket manners ( e.g. , signs warn that anyone asking for autographs may be removed from the grounds ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the back . The press exploded in typographical fireworks . Bannered the <P> News Chronicle : ONE OF THE GREAT DAYS . <P>
