On the eve of World War II , the 51,656-ton German liner Bremen slunk ghostlike out of New York and ran for Europe with lights out to avoid the searching British navy . War caught up with the Bremen , and British bombing and fire reduced it to a worthless hulk in its home port of Bremerhaven . Last week a new Bremen sailed into New York harbor on her maiden voyage from Bremerhaven , and the lights went on again for North German Lloyd , West Germany 's biggest passenger-shipping company . <P> The new Bremen , fifth in a xoi-year line to bear the name , is Germany 's biggest liner and one of the world 's most luxurious ( airconditioning , nonbruising doorknobs , clothes dryers for wash-and-wear suits ) . Her owner , North German Lloyd , returning to transatlantic luxury service after 20 years ' absence , is a monument to the frugality and enterprise that brought back Germany 's decimated merchant marine to its present strength of 2,400 ships . <P> Saved : $19 Million . Founded in 1857 , North German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before World War II ; its queenly Europa and Bremen IV competed with British and French ships on equal terms . But the war cost the line 99.5% of its tonnage . The task of reconstruction fell to brisk Director Richard Bertram , 55 , and pfennig-pinching Co-Director Johannes Kulen-kampff , fiftyish , who personally picks through the company 's discarded files to salvage used paper clips . <P> <P> Aware that North German Lloyd was synonymous with service , Bertram and Kulenkampff set up a hotel and restaurant in Bremen to hold together stewards and cooks , placed seamen on other ships until jobs were ready for them . With $22 million in government loans and fast tax write-offs , they quickly built up a fleet of new freighters , now have 40 in service . <P> Five years ago , they decided to ease back into the passenger business , started off with the 19,100-ton Swedish hospital ship Gripsholm ( cost : $2,500,000 ) to save the time and money of building a new ship , rechristened her Berlin . Bremen was made over in similar fashion two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1939 . Lloyd rebuilt her completely at an overall cost of $25 million . Says Bertram : " The same ship would cost $44 million starting from scratch , and we would n't get delivery before 1963 . " Entering New York harbor last week , Bremen was saluted by the outbound Berlin , received the traditional harbor welcome given for a maiden voyage . <P> Cured : " Manager 's Sickness . " The new Bremen is slower ( six days from Southampton at 23 knots ) and smaller ( 32,336 tons ) than the old , which carried twice as many passengers ( 2,231 v. 1,122 ) . But Lloyd plans to pitch its appeal to tourists who want leisurely travel , non-dress-up luxury and fine , hearty food . Probably his best year-round clientele , figures Director Bertram , will be ocean-hopping businessmen who need a respite from the jet pace ( some German firms now require executives flying the ocean to return by ship ) .
