If it is really possible to govern a country by ritual and yielding , there is no more to be said . But if it is not really possible , of what use is ritual ? <P> - Confucius <P> China 's claim to suzerainty over Mongolia was mostly ritual and yielding . In 1921 Russia 's Bolsheviks , taking advantage of China 's own Civil War , helped out a local revolution against Chinese rule , and in 1924 Bolshevik Choibalsan set up the Soviet puppet People 's Republic of Mongolia ( pop . 900,000 ) , an area more than twice the size of Texas , wedged between Soviet Siberia and China . <P> In those days , even the Bolsheviks admitted that China had some rights there . Said No . I Chinese Communist Mao Tse-tung to Correspondent Edgar ( Red Star Over China ) Snow in 1936 : " When the people 's revolution has been victorious in China , the Outer Mongolian Republic will automatically become a part of the Chinese federation at their own will . " But when the Reds finally seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . On Moscow 's orders , Red China renounced all claim to Outer Mongolia . <P> Old Communist Choibalsan died in the Kremlin hospital last January , but Moscow planned to keep a firm grip on the country he created . When the new Premier , U. Tsedenbal , arrived in Moscow last August , he was received with honors equal to those given Chinese Foreign Minister Chou Enlai . At the airport to shake the Premier 's hand was Soviet Foreign Minister Vishinsky . Tsedenbal and the Russians went into a huddle and called a play calculated to dissolve any lingering impression that Outer Mongolia had traditional attachments to China . <P> Off to Peking they sent Premier Tsedenbal , where ( on orders from the Kremlin ) he got the kind of welcome given only to the head of a sovereign state . Tsedenbal signed a ten-year treaty with Red China pledging cultural , economic and educational exchanges . No mention was made of a military alliance , thus underlining the fact that Outer Mongolia 's only military connections are with the Soviet Union . At lavish banquets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin , but for every toast honoring Mao , the " great leader of the Chinese people , " there were at least six eulogies of Stalin , hailed as the " Father of the Mongolian Republic . . . who has emancipated us from the imperialist Chinese yoke . " Sweet are the uses of ritual .
