 | The 12 Incredible Days of Col. John Page l LT . CoL. John Upshur Dennis Page was a U. S. Army artillery officer , a bespectacled , 46-year-old professional soldier who had spent most of his career yearning for a solid chance at combat . When his chance finally came , in Korea in 1950 , he took such heroic advantage of it that the Marine Corps gave him its highest award ? the Navy Cross . By law , the Congressional Medal of Honor must be awarded within three years of the action for which it is given . But the saga of John Page went unnoticed until it was too late for action . Should it ever be too late to honor a hero of Page 's stature ? Senators Russell B. Long of Louisiana and John M. Butler of Maryland do not think so . They have drawn up a bill designed to open for review all such cases for one year . It will be considered by Congress during the present session . The evidence that John Page deserves the Congressional Medal lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most critical days of American arms ? during the blood-drenched breakout from Chosin Reservoir in North Korea to the sea . Many men are alive today who would not have made it back if it had not been for John Page . Here is his story : IN OCTOBER 1950 John Page left for in New Orleans . But he was a solKorea almost eagerly . He hated to dier , and he had had little combat leave his wife and children at home experience . Throughout World War THE 12 INCREDIBLE DAYS OF COL . JOHN PAGE 85  | II he had been plagued with a reputation as a troubleshooter who knew how to whip an outfit into fighting trim . The Army had kept him doing just that at Fort Sill , Okla . Page arrived at Tenth Corps headquarters in Hamhung , Korea , on November 27 . The next day he was asked to handle a special mission . Red Chinese armies had crossed the Yalu River and now teemed in the hills around and behind U. N. lines , disrupting communications and supply . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened . It had to be kept open at all cost . Page was given the job of placing communications along the road , to keep track of enemy activity . At 5:30 a.m. on November 29 he led a nine-jeep communications convoy north from Hamhung through five inches of newly fallen snow toward the Chosin Reservoir , 56 miles away . By late afternoon he had stationed his teams at vital points along the road . Then he and his driver , Cpl . David E. Klepsig of Macon , Ga. , headed for the village of Koto-ri , regimental command post of Marine Col. ( now Lt. Gen. , retired ) Lewis B. " Chesty " Puller . Page did n't know it then , but his first taste of combat lay just a few miles ahead . It was nearly dark as the jeep approached a blown-out bridge . Klepsig steered off the road , down the embankment to the frozen stream . A burst of machine-gun fire ripped the air above them . Page and Klepsig scrambled out of the jeep and raced to the cover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Reds were on a low hill , 50 yards away . Every few minutes Page or Klepsig would peer over the top of the abutment and bullets would splatter the road in front of them . For half an hour they stayed pinned to the wall . The last light of day was fading . Page was worried . In the dark the enemy could surround them . " We ca n't stay here , " he decided finally . " Corporal , go get the jeep . I 'll cover you and meet you where you turn back into the road . " Klepsig started running , fast and low , thinking that Page meant to cover him with fire from behind the abutment . He jumped into the jeep and roared across the stream , trying to believe what he saw in front of him : there in the middle of the road , completely exposed at point-blank range , stood Colonel Page , spraying the Chinese position with carbine fire . He had forced the Reds ' attention completely on himself , and had so startled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stunned at Page 's interpretation of covering fire , Klepsig nearly ran over him in his frenzied dash to pick  | him up . With Page in the jeep , he pushed the accelerator to the floor and careened down the ice-covered road out of enemy range . He kept the jeep at top speed until Page shouted , " Slow down , corporal ! Do you want to get us killed ? " Under cover of darkness they made their way to Koto-ri . There , in the morning , Page stopped to check out at Puller 's command post . News was given him : Koto-ri was surrounded by Chinese troops and stood an excellent chance of being obliterated . At this , Page began rounding up stray Army men ? artillerymen , military police , engineers , medics , truck drivers ? who had been cut off from their outfits , and organized them into a shock-troop reserve for Puller 's Marines . He split them into groups and drew up battle plans for each in an assigned sector of the Koto-ri perimeter . The Chinese were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night and sometimes during the day . Each time the Marines drove them off , but casualties mounted . The small Marine hospital was filled , and Chesty Puller looked urgently for a way to evacuate his wounded ? fast . The airstrip in the village was too short for C-47s , and the small observer planes could carry out only two men at a time . The runway had to be lengthened ; the job was given to Page . The airstrip was inside the lines held by the Marines . Now it had to be stretched i000 yards into noman 's land . Washboard ground , frozen solid , had to be graded level . Army and Marine engineers moved out with graders , and 15 volunteers from Page 's reserve company went along . The Chinese snipers in the hills made it a bloody business . Page asked Lt. Charles F. Kieffer , an observer-plane pilot , to fly him on an inspection tour of the village 's defenses . Page climbed aboard looking like a walking arsenal : he carried a loaded carbine ; his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung from his belt . In the air , he turned to Kieffer . " I would like , " he said , " to fly over that tent at the top of the mountain pass just to the south . " Kieffer flew low over the spot , and Page studied the trails in the snow that led from the surrounding hills . Obviously the tent was an enemy shelter . He motioned to Kieffer to make another pass . The pilot watched , wide-eyed , as Page pulled the pins from three grenades , leaned from the cockpit and threw them down . The explosions blended into a single roar . The small plane nosed upward , and Kieffer looked back . The tent was destroyed . Now Page pointed at a long ridge west of Koto-ri , and Kieffer headed for it , wondering if Page meant to carry out a sustained air raid against enemy ground forces . The ridge was pockmarked with enemy foxholes , and from it Red soldiers fired at will at targets on the airstrip and in the village . Page shouted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAYS OF COL . JOHN PAGE 87  | plane hummed along the ridge , and Page began bombing the foxholes . At the end of the ridge Page ordered Kieffer to circle back ? lower ! Kieffer flew back at 50 feet , and Page began raking the foxholes with his carbine . A Chinese soldier stood up and leveled his rifle at the plane , then dropped it and fell forward . Other Reds died in their foxholes . Page used his last grenades to demolish a foxhole holding three Red soldiers , then ordered Kieffer to return to Koto-ri for more ammunition . But the second air raid was called off . The plane was needed to evacuate a badly wounded Marine . Grounded , Page walked out to check progress on the runway . Suddenly the driver of a grader fell from his seat , a bullet through his neck . And now Red snipers began pouring fire at the airstrip . Everyone raced zigzagging for cover . Everyone except John Page . He stood in the middle of the runway , spotting the snipers ' positions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be finished . He ran to a tank , leaped atop it behind a .50-caliber machine gun and shouted to the crew inside . The tank rumbled away from the runway , straight toward the snipers , right to the fringe of the enemy-infested hill . Page found his targets carefully , fired in lethal bursts . The snipers rolled down slopes or slumped in foxholes , dead . Quite suddenly it was quiet . The battle was over . Page stationed lookouts around the airstrip , and the work went on . Then he heard a shout . Eleven Chinese soldiers came out of a gully , their hands in the air . They had had enough . Page and some of his lookouts hustled them to the Marine command post for interrogation , then sprinted back toward sounds of heavy firing on the airstrip . The Chinese were charging out of the gullies , trying to take the runway . They reached the edge of it before the Marines ' fire stopped them . Then , suddenly , they broke and ran for the hills . Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top and ordered it forward . As the tank surged across the runway , the Marines behind stopped firing . They watched Page unbelievingly , and waited fearfully for a Red bullet to cut him down . None did . The Chinese , surprised and frightened , wanted only to escape , to get away from this madman . After that day they gave the airstrip at Koto-ri wide berth , and Page and his men worked on doggedly ? dynamiting , bulldozing , leveling . By December 6 the runway was ready . At once it was as busy as a bus stand . Marine and Air Force transports took out huge loads of wounded and frostbitten men . In three days more than 700 men were flown south . On December 7 , Marine and Army elements from the north fought their way into Koto-ri with hundreds of new wounded . One day was set aside to evacuate the wounded and rest the exhausted troops who faced a tortuous 50-mile march to the sea .  | The road that corkscrewed down the mountain from Koto-ri was treacherous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten miles of ambush . To survive , the file would have to keep moving . Once it stopped , the Chinese in the hills could overrun it . The push began early in the morning of December 9 , with Page in the column . All went well for the first half-mile ; then the column stopped . A Chinese machine gun was hitting it from the top of a hill . Page leaped from his jeep and ran forward . He spotted the nest , climbed aboard a tank and rammed machine-gun fire back at it . The column moved again . Page silenced the Reds , then ran forward to find Corporal Klepsig and his jeep . Yard by yard , mile by mile , the column slugged its way down the mountain road . A truck stalled at a hairpin curve , and an enemy machine gun suddenly flailed the road from a nearby hill . Page grabbed a machine gun , scrambled up the slope and lashed the enemy position with fire until the column had passed . Page again walked forward , looking for Klepsig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Night fell , and the thatched huts of a village called Sudong-ni loomed out of the darkness . The column had reached safety . Two regiments had passed through Sudong-ni ahead of it . No danger here . And then it happened ! Machine-gun and rifle fire exploded into the column from the front and both sides . It was the perfect ambush . The Reds had let the two regiments pass , then had sneaked into the village in the dark and caught this segment of the column with its guard relaxed . Grenades and mortar shells burst everywhere . Brilliant flares hung in the sky over the trapped column . Trucks and jeeps were in flames , and men jumped and ran for cover , while others , too late , dropped where they stood . The column sat dead on the road . " Come on ! " shouted Page , sprinting forward . " We 've got to get this column moving ! " He snapped his carbine to automatic and ran straight into the frontal fire . Two Marines followed . One stopped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , Pfc . Marvin L. Wasson of West Albany , N.Y. , stayed with Page . They dashed through the hail of fire , dodging wrecked trucks and jeeps , tripping over corpses , until finally they lunged into the heart of the enemy position , their carbines spewing death . Thirty Chinese soldiers , taken completely by surprise , bolted for the hills . One threw a grenade , and Wasson went down with fragments in his ear and arm . " Get back ! " Page shouted to the wounded Marine . " Go back ! That 's an order ! I 'll cover you ! " Dazed , Wasson staggered back , stopping to watch as Page ran on . Their onslaught had broken the enemy 's road block for precious 1956 THE 12 INCREDIBLE DAYS OF COL . JOHN PAGE 89  | minutes , just long enough for the Marines behind to take charge . In an hour they won control of Sudong-ni . Late that night the column was moving again . Just beyond Sudongni , on a cold , lonely stretch of road heaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page . He had taken 16 Communists with him . John Page 's only professional dream had been a chance to fight for his country . He got that chance finally , and when his 12 incredible clays were finished , he died well , in front of his men , the way a combat officer should . The Marines knelt beside the body in the road . Someone began to mutter a prayer . The others gaped in disbelief . " I 've heard of these one-man armies , " a Marine said finally . " But this Colonel Page ? I saw him . He was a tank commander , a bombardier , an engineer , an artilleryman ? and what a foot soldier ! The Medal of Honor was made for him ! " He may get it yet , if Congress and the Army deem it fitting . @#
