ON A humid Wednesday afternoon a few months ago a man appeared in my office and lay before me a long piece of paper , a subpoena to appear before the Jenner subcommittee of the Internal Committee of the Judiciary of the United States Senate . Since it was the first subpoena I had ever received , I wondered for a terrible moment what crime I had committed. ? Then colleagues and students , friends and well-wishers , began to come in to congratulate me " We are so glad it has happened , " they said . " You will speak for us . You will take up our cause . " I wondered whether they knew the fear I felt . I thanked them all , and then I closed my office door and sat and looked at the wall . ' While I sat facing the wall , I learned again about fear  --  how terribly debasing it is , and how doubly debasing is fear of the unknown . I knew the terrible pOssibilities of the " smear . " I knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings were made secret in order to protect those on trial . I knew the curiosity of people better than that . The minute the investigations were announced , speculation ran rife . One newspaper reporter called me and said . " I assume that you got a subpoena . " The Sun-Times was right when it stated that " an invitation to appear before the committee casts doubt on a man 's reputation . " Subtly corroding as is the smear , it is not the worst part of being dragged on to a platform and forced to swear to things which are perfectly obvious to-you and to everyone who knows you No one should have to defend himself under such circumstances . If the life he has lived is not defense enough , then no defense should be attempted . To defend myself upon such terms meant that I was guilty until I proved myself innocent ! How do you meet such a ready-made suspicion of guilt ? ' These men , Jenner and Butler , were out to judge the degree of evil in me. - And there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way , felt guilty . For men would kill in other men the evil they know in themselves . HOW , I asked myself , as I sat there , could I meet the accusations of these men ? Who was Jenner that he should judge me ? And what could he do to me if he judged me unworthy ? Another man subpoenaed , a law student , spent mUch , time trying to find out the exact powers and prerogatives of the committee He discovered that no one knew much about them . Practic-ally , my colleague told me , the committee functions in somewhat the same way as the Inquisition did in Spain : the clerical arm ( the committee ) hands over the victim , following interrogation , to the secular arm ( in this case , ? the university ) . The secular arm is responsible for chopping off the victim 's head  --  that is , firing him . Of course , if the secular arm does n't come through  --  and in this case the university stood firm behind its teachers  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " might or might not do was not the main thing on my mind A- lot of little questions tortured me . How do you meet your own quotes , pulled out of context ? To whom did you give the five dollars for some obscure cause ? And deeper still : what are the values on which you stand ; what are traditions which you uphold against the inquisitors ? I suppose that my first reaction to the last question was a simple and primitive one . I believe that if you live by the code of a man at all , if you dare call yourself a man , you say , " I shall answer for my life , yes , but not for another 's . " I remembered E. M. Forster 's mildly seditious words on the sub ) ect : I hate the idea of causes , and if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend , I hope I should ' have the guts to betray my country . Such a choice may scandalize the modern reader , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once and ring up the police . It would not have shocked Dante , though Dante placed Brutus and Cassius in the lowest of hell because they had chosen to betray their friend , Julius Caesar , rather than their country , Rome Then I remembered that a refusal to answer questions once the process has started may mean contempt of court . But how is it possible to answer ques. tions about yourself and not about your ' associates ? I happened to be fortunate in not having to meet this contingency . My contacts with people who might be defined as " subversive " were always social or professional . They did not tell me , and I did not ask . I never knew a single self-confessed Communist . Others of my colleagues were not so fortunate . In order not to give aid and comfort to the committee , or in order not to inform , many of them behind the protection Amendment . I did not remain , silent . I told Senator Jenner , who comes from my home state of Indiana , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was not now a Communist ; that I had always , by virtue of my culture and convictions , been anti-authoritarian ; that I belonged to the order of the ' Brethren by birth and was both a minister and a professor by trade . At this the committee seemed to become confused . They were not aware of these things , they told me , and they asked me no more questions . They said they were sorry to have called me up in this way I asked them if they thought they were any sorrier to have called me up than I was to have been called up , and then I went back-to my office . It was - then that I began to feel angry . Having been denied a public hearing , I learned later from the newspapers that Professor Ernest Burgess , Professor Anton J. Carlson , and myself had been forced to give testimony because we had been keeping bad company . But I insist that the company I keep is my own business , not Senator Jenner 's , Representative Velde 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. A. M. ? and in the purged unions . I insist now  --  and thanks to the committee I am going to insist more firmly and more often  --  on my right to speak to these friends , to continue having them in my home , and to continue to make up my own mind . Noel Sargent of the N. A. M. and Harry Bridges are both welcome in my home and for the same reason : they are interesting , and they teach me a great deal . I really doubt , however , that I shall join either the Longshoremen or the N. A. M Odd is n't it , that John Foster Dulles could associate with.Alger Hiss and not be subverted ? Odd , too , that we . think we can try to negotiate peace with the Communists and will respect the treaties growing out of such negotiations . Or is it that we sincerely expect to negotiate with Vishinsky only when he stops being a Communist ? Certainly , I have gone to meetings where Communists were present , and I have probably appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a better way of getting to understand Communists . But it bothers me that it is they who are always expected to convert me , and people like me , rather than vice versa . LET US CALL things by their right names . To my knowledge none of the men called up in the present investigations of universities and colleges have ever been accused of sabotage or of any act breaking any criminal law on the books . The worst they-have ' been accused of is political deviation . Many of us remember those years when the government , through the La Follette committee , was investigating not labor but industry . The La Follette committee was questioning the right of one section of the body politic to hurt other sections economically . But'the La Follette committee never concerned itself with the free flow of ideas , political or otherwise . And Y do not remember e that there was any whispering campaign to the effect that " John Jones , who - lives down the block , used to consort with industrialists . " Jenner , Velde , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , produced for trial one man engaged in a conspiracy . They have threatened , however , the free flow of ideas in terms of a second-rate cloak-and-dagger melodrama . " Conspirators , " " spies , " " traitors , " " sab-oteurs " ? these are the epithets which the good Congressmen hurl at the ' men whom they would- " get . " Westbrook Pegler , who seems to ride high on the investigation bandwagon , uses terms even saltier . Eager for a fist fight with those " dirty blankety-blank reds " in one paragraph , he ' demands in another an investigation . of Eleanor Roosevelt , Justice Frankfurter , Henry Wallace , and Dean Acheson . Ten or fifteen years ago we could have put Westbrook Pegler down as a hysterical journalist , relatively harmless , more than a bit touched by reading too much of his own propaganda . Blit we can ' no longer afford to shrug such hysterics off . In Senator McCarthy 's view , as The Nation pointed out in an editorial , The Present Danger , on June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate have always been ' followers of the Communist Party line ' ; tomorrow they will be ' card- . carrying Communists . ' A recent cartoon m one of the labor papers showing a witness assuring a Congressional committee that he is not and never has been ' a member of the Democratic Party ' clearly foreshadows the McCarthy line in the 1954 election . " THERE IS something both ominous and familiar about these men who build their careers on accusations . I am reminded vaguely of the Moscow purge trials and the old-time Bolsheviks who were forced to accuse themselves of having been " spies , saboteurs , capitalist warmongers , deviationists , filthy counter-revolutionists . " That was another cloak-and-dagger melodrama , played on a larger stage , succeeding the somber " Boris Godonov " and " The Brothers Karamazov " ? instead of " Wintergreen , for President " and " Call Me Madam . " What particularly sticks in my mind about the Moscow melodrama is the deep , unspoken desire to be judged inherent in the confession of an old Bolshevik like Bukharin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a last statement of complete guilt ? " Citizen Judges , I am nothing . . . " We in America , out of our experience - with successful democracy , surveyed the process which turned logical Marxists into breast-beating self-accusers with something of a sneer . They knew nothing of due process , those Russians , they could not be expected to understand that decent jurisprudence never permits a man to accuse himself ( And who seeks now to render the-Fifth Amendment legally useless ? ) Some of us also realized that the Old Bolsheviks were confused about the difference between " community " and " state . " They had had no experience with the community ; they had set up the state in a new form and they could feel nothing but defeat when judged by their own creation . Their long , ' hyperthyroid confession of crime could only have been pre-cooked by the inquisitors , and yet their guilt was real . History having been their god , they were - guilty of making a mistake before history and before their own misbegotten state . ( And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with- God , and patriotism with godliness ? ) . t None of us in America have ever really believed - that this sort of thing could happen here . We have too easily held ourselves just a. little above the " rabble " in the rest of the world . We have a superior system of law , you see , and a superior system of government not to mention our superior standard of living Ergo , our logic runs , we are a superior set of , people . We should begin to remember that the basic facts of human life  --  and politics  --  are pretty much the same everywhere . Just as in Germany , given the proper conditions , something deep in men responded to a Hitler , so here , given the conditions , something in the human grain responds to a McCarthy . THE FEAR in our country today is - almost as terrible as the fear which beset Europe between wars , when " the pauperized bourgeois became rebels of the right or left . . many . . . lived on pointlessly , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim windows of Europe " Writing of those men who became Communists in an era when potatoes were burned before a starving world in order to keep prices high , Richard Grossman said : Their conversion , in fact , was rooted in despair  --  a despair of Western values It is easy enough in retrospect to see that this despair was hysterical . Fascism , after all , was overcome , without the surrender of civil liberties which communism involves . But were Gide and Koestler so obviously wrong , at the time when they became Communists , in feeling that German and French democracy was corrupt and would surrender to fascism ? . . . it jogs our memories so uncomfortably : and reminds us of the terrible loneliness experienced by Lthe " premature anti-fascists , " the men and women who understood fascism And tried to fight it before it was respectable to do so . It was that loneliness which opened their minds to the appeal of corn/3111111SM . IL is another kind of lofleliness , which opens our 1953 minds to the appeal of professional anti-communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , like any public , is basically non-inquisitorial and committed to minding its own business , you must understand the present fear in America . It is not the fear of hunger but rather - fear of the hungry . Our executives are the busiest , our productive plant is the biggest , our farmers are the most secure , and our people are the best-dressed in the world . And yet , by and large , we are as afraid and lonely as the tired winter flies who crawled across the dim windows of Europe . For the rest of the world keeps reminding us that we are rich and they are not . America awaits lethargically the stroke of midnight when the coach will turn back into- a pumpkin . After all , the coach is partly built of such fragile stuff as fear of war and preparation for war . If we can only hunt down enough of the Bad Men who if driven into the desert will take our guilt with them , perhaps the coach will remain a coach after all . Communism , born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desecrated ideals ; is a hard , cruel , narrow , and yet strangely visionary religion . The new faith , of which Senators Jenner and McCarthy are the prophets , is born of full bellies and the fear of insolvency , and is called , interestingly enough , anti-communism . It is not at all visionary . The inquisitorial mind is as likely to be hatched on Main Street , America , as in- Seville or Moscow . And since it is , in general , a painfully literal mind , lacking imagination , Senator Jenner 's view of me was mistaken . He was ostensibly looking for Communists , and I could not oblige . And yet I was guilty of the crime he was really looking for . I was guilty , all my life , of having been a sectarian . I was guilty , too , of not holding the new faith of anti-communism any more than I had held - the Communist faith preceding it And the thing which saved me , individually , from both ; was a sense of community transcending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the American tradition and behind that is the Judeao-Christian tradition , and the heritage of Greece . " Citizens of Athens , " said Socrates . Since our world seems no closer than was Athens to solving the dilemma posed by Socrates , I should like to make my own position clear . I believe , with Albert Einstein , that no teacher , no intellectual , can afford to cooperate with - an inquisitorial process ; he does so on pain of losing his soul . I would go farther and say that no man who is a decent member of his community can afford to cooperate either . Only by choosing as Socrates did can a man be directly responsible to the community and to those values which can not morally be rendered unto Caesar . The teacher , to my thinking , has one primary responsibility  --  to the students whom he teaches and through them to the interests of humanity as distinct from the interests of any pressure group or nation-state which would presumptuously set itself up as sovereign over the human family . A secondary responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict with it . The teacher should be loyal to the duty he-has undertaken ? to try to discover the truth and , as far as possible , the whole truth .
