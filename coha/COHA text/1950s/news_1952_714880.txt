txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 2 ? The creation of a Board of Passport Appeals , to advise the Secretary of State on refusals of passports to United States citizens , was announced at the State Department today . New regulations were issued , effective at once , intended to conform with a recent Federal court decision holding that an applicant to whom a passport had been denied had not received the benefit of due process of law , as defined in the Constitution . Under the new procedure an applicant will have two chances to present his side of the case . As at present , he will be permitted to appear , with counsetif desired , before an official of the Passport Division , after he has been formally notified that sufficient derogatory information has been received about him to justify refusal of the passport  --  unless the information is disproved or explained . After such a hearing the Passport Division will review the matter , taking into account the testimony offered by the applicant at the first hearing . Should the decision again be adverse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter before the Board of Passport Appeals and to appear , again with counsel if desired . Would Assure ' Due Rights ' The right to appear with counsel was included in the new regulations merely as a matter of insuring " due process , " within the decision of the Federal court , and was not intended to indicate any need for legal advice in the usual case . If the Appeals Board finds against the applicant it will so recommend to the Secretary of State , who has the final legal re sponsibility for any action taken . As a matter of practice , an adverse finding by the board would normally mean that no passport woud be issued . The Appeals Board will be composed of at least three officers of the State Department who have had no previous connection with the application . In the case of both hearings , the instructions directed that the preponderance of evidence prevail , as in court cases , and that witnesses sleight be required to tesfify under oath . The right of appeal was directed to apply " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action ' of the department in granting , refusing , restricting , withdrawing , canceling , revoking , extending , renewing , or in any // other fashion or degree affecting the ability of a person to use a passport through action taken in a particular case . " A departmental spokesman , commenting on the new regulations , said that " we are in the business of issuing passports , not denying them . " He added that , in the last twelve months , some 350,000 applications were approved and only ninety-five denied . . Standards Are Established In addition to setting up the appeals procedure , the new regulations , established standards for the guidance of passport officials in the matter of denials of applications . They were forbidden to issue a passport , except one limited to direct and immediate return to the United States , to a citizen with the following degrees of relationship to the Communist party ( described as " an integral unit " of the world Communist movement ) : ( lActual members , or those who , recently terminated membership ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . cHndividuals , regardless of for- , mal affiliation , whose activities ' supporting the Communist movement warrant the conclusion they have done so under the " direction , demination , or control " of that movement . gIndividuals , regardless of affiliation , about whom there is reason , to believe , " on the balance of all ' the evidence , " that their intended activities abroad will be directed knowingly and wilfully to advancing the Communist movement . Another category was established for which a passport could only be issued for immediate and direct return to the United States , " in order to promote the national interest by assuring that the conduct of foreign relations shall be free from unlawful interference . " This class covers persons believed , on the balance of evidence , to be " going abroad to engage in activities while abroad which would violate the laws of the United States , or which if carried on in the United States would violate such laws designed to protect the security of the United States .
