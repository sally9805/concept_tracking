Trinidad has no concert hall and no symphony orchestra , and few visiting artists ever get to Port-of-Spain , its capital , just off the coast of Venezuela . But Trinidadians may well be the world 's most musical people . Out of prosaic newspaper headlines they created calypso songs , and out of such unmusical items as oil drums and automobile brake drums they created the world 's newest musical combo , the steelband ( pronounced steelbon in Trinidad ) . Both were invented with sure instinct for novelty and self-expression by Trinidad 's Negro population . <P> Giant Mandolin . At 4 a.m. one day last week , the streets of Port-of-Spain were quiet , but an occasional lighted window showed dark figures stirring . At 5 , donkey carts laden with coconuts were moving towards the market , passing sidewalks packed with quiet crowds . Finally , a clock chimed 6 , and , as if unleashed , the crowds ran and danced out into the streets . Trinidad 's Carnival was under way . <P> Before the note of the chime had faded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a sweet thrumming that , as it grew closer , began to resemble a giant mandolin playing a pretty tune . It was accompanied by an insistent clanging , like a syncopated firebell . Within a few minutes no fewer than 139 steelbands burst onto Port-of-Spain 's streets , gathering prancing followers as they went . The marchers strode , sensuously , with bent knees and swinging hips , sometimes six or eight clasped together in a veering line , sometimes a single marcher so excited by the music that he leaped out into an eccentric solo dance . For two days and nights the marchers and musicians strutted the streets , each band beating out its favorite road march in calypso tempo-Princess Charming , with its sweet , giddy , last phrase , Yankees Gone , with its sudden , catchy pause . Shaver Man , with its obsessive repeated phrase . <P> Steel Coming In . During Carnival there is scarcely a person-save a few fusty English colonials in temporary retirement on quieter islands near by-who does not " jump up " to the stimulating rhythms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have gone on making it over the years despite organized restrictions . <P> Skin drums were long banned by the British in order to suppress African tribal traditions , but Trinidad musicians discovered they could make a kind of music with tubes of bamboo . " Bamboo-tamboo " bands competed with each other , thunking large-bore tubes on the ground and whacking smaller sticks together in the air to create a rich polyrhythmic effect ; onlookers , unable to resist the compelling beat , would pound anything that would make noise . But by the early ' 30s bamboo was on its way out-the police had found that the sticks were too likely to be used as weapons . Then Port-of-Spain musicians turned to garbage-can tops and biscuit tins . Someone-maybe " Spree " Simon or Aulrick Springer or " Totee " Lewis-decided to outline the parts of the tin top which had different pitches . He dented a line across , dividing the pan into segments , and found he had two different notes . The establishment of a U.S. base brought the latest refinement : oil drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
