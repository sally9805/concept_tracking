txt I LONDON , Aug. 26 ? Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd will urge President Eisenhower to support a summit conference this fall . The promotion of such a meeting is the one tangible objective of the Britons in their talks with the President , who is to arrive here tomorrow evening . The British Government , it can be said authoritatively , believes that Berlin 's future can be settled only by negotiation among President Eisenhower , Mr. Macmillan , President Charles de Gaulle of France and Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev of the Soviet Union . Issue Held Still Perilous The East-West conflict over West Berlin may have faded from public consciousness , but it is still alive and serious , even dangerous , in the minds of British leaders . The Government 's emphasis on a summit conference , it is conceded , differs radically from the views of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany . The British believe Dr. Adenauer will entreat the President to limit his encounters with Mr. Khrushchev to their exchange a visits . The British , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to economic interference by the East Germans is such that attempts must be made soon at the summit to negotiate an interim settlement . The London Government accepts at face value warnings on this score from Mayor Willy Brandt of West Berlin=warnings that , Chancellor Adenauer apparently discounts . Talks to Be Informal No formal , agendal have been prepared for the talks between the President and the Prime Minister . To the British this appears to be an advantage . Much more can be accomplished , in their view , by casual conversations between twe old friends taking their ease at Chequers , the Prime Minister 's country residence , than in formal meetings . There are , however , certain topics that both sides expect to discuss . The two leaders will certainly talk over a letter to Mr. Macmillan from Mr. Khrushchev . This , letter dealing with the future of Germany , arrived last // week . In the British view no immediate answer is required . The letter is long and detailed but it contains " nothing startling " that would induce Mr. Macmillan to summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's answer probably will be short and to the point , despite the Soviet leader 's apparent belief that succinct letters reflect a lack of interest . I The Prime Minister will offer his counsel to the President on the best approach to Premier Khrushchev . Mr. Macmillan 's own experience in Moscow early this year has convinced him that on basic issues , severe , even brutal , frankness i. necessary . The Prime Minister believes he made no headway with Mr. Khrushchev until he ? maue it plain that if the worst came , Britain had no intention of sur-rendering , Paris Relations Touchy The British are wary about discussing the President 's visit to France and any advice Mr. Macmillan might offer in this field . This is a consequence of charge in Paris that the Anglo-American leaders are ? bent on excluding General de Gaulle from the highest councils of the West . But speeches by Premier Michel Debre criticizing France 's allies have aroused considerable concern here , and it is thought here that it would be natural for the President and the Prime Minister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also thought that the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary may stress the damage that would be done to the ' Western position in the Middle East and Asia by any outright endorsement of French policy in Algeria . British leaders feel nothing concrete can be negotiated with General de Gaulle until France explodes her first atomic bomb . That event will strengthen his hand , it is conceded , but at least all the cards will be on the table . Although Dr. Adenauer 's dislike of Britain has been ventilated half a dozen times in the last four months , London is not worried by any criticism of this country the Chancellor may make to President Eisenhower tomorrow . Britons who know the President well believe a display of Anglophobia by the Chancellor would be a mistake . They believe the President by experience is more aware of the popular British attitude toward Germany than was the late John Foster Dulles . Stated in the baldest terms , this is that the Britons are willing to welcome West Germany as a worthy ally in the struggle to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the German character has altered greatly in fifteen years .
