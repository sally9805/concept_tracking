IN his well-organized and well-docu1 mented book , Kenneth M. Stampp considers the Negro slave as an economic integer and as a socio-cultural determinant in the life of the ante-bellum South . He succeeds in stripping away the myths of both ardent pro , slavery writers and abolitionists , and he views in correct proportion the good , the evil , the facts and the remarkably durable myths that make up the history of the peculiar institution . Making short shrift of the notions that the institution of slavery was a ) a happy paternalistic arrangement between master and slave and b ) an economic burden that the gentry graciously ? bore out of a sense of responsibility to their slaves , he shows that the only justification for slavery was that slaveholders made a lot of money from The Peculiar Institution , by Kenneth M. Stampp ( Knopf ; $5.75 ) . their investments . Mr. Stampp points out that the average cost for one plantation owner for maintenance over the period 1844-48 was less than $25 per slave . In the 1850 's an " A-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1500 . A planter might expect , a seven-to-10 percent return on his investment , and depreciation was not a matter for serious reckoning . As the value of the slave in the South 's agrarian economy increased , ownership of slaves became a hallmark of social status . The social climber had only to get himself some land and a Major Barbara is not only one of the  - -  VI best of Bernard Shaw 's plays , it is one of the most beautiful in the English repertory ; The Apple Cart is not particularly good Shaw and is certainly not a good play . Yet of the two Shaw productions , temporarily resident on Broadway , Maurice Evans ' The Apple Cart is much more acceptable than Charles Laughton 's Major Barbara . Both productions are rich with hokum , but in The Apple Cart , staged , by George Shaefer , the hokum is good clean fun and not the arty pretension that murders Major Barbara . After all , the playwright was aware of the infirmities that upset The Apple Cart . After its performance at the Malvern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the whole few slaves ; the more he had , the better for his own prestige . " Eventually , " as Mr. Stampp remarks , " the omnipresent slave , became the symbol of the South and the cornerstone of its culture . When that happened , disaster was , close at . hand ? in fact that in itself was disaster . " " The great mass of Southern whites , who were non-slaveholders , " he continues , " gained not even the profits and conveniences of slavery to offset its baleful impact on their lives , " and it is these whites who feared the Negroes as their mortal enemies . It was perhaps during this time that the seeds were sown for the bitter dissensions that are ripening today . Without attempting a profound study of the mingling of African and Western cultures , Mr. Stampp presents an authoritative picture of slave life , and of the slave 's attitude toward emancipation . As he observes : One can feel compassion for the antebellum white man ; one can ' understand the moral dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Negro , not the white man , was the slave , and the Negro gained the most from emancipation . When freedom came ? even the quasi-freedom of " second-class citizenship ? the Negro , in literal truth , lost nothing but his chains . affair is a frightful bag of stage tricks , as old as Sophodes . I blushed when I saw it . " The Apple Cart , shorn of its often amusing additions , tells the story of the triumph of King Magnus , an English king in some undated future ; over his cabinet , as quarrelsome , foolish , ineffectual and likable a bunch of ladies and gentlemen as one is likely to see this side of a faculty meeting . Although Shaw has given the play a three-act structure , essentially the action falls into two acts , one in which the cabinet demands the withdrawal of the king 's last constitutional power and the other ( here the third ) in which the king , threatening abdication and a possible political career as a commoner brings the cabinet around . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extensive discussion of democracy , the strong man , real and illusory political power , all the ideas that Shaw was concerned with all his life . The Apple Cart is the first of Shaw 's later plays , those in which his doubt about the effectiveness of the democratic process became more marked . If ' The Apple Cart shows Shaw 's doubt , it does not yet bear the marks of despair that were to touch his plays as his basic optimism was battered by the depression and the approach of World War II . There is much nonsense in The Apple Cart that is there simply for the fun of it , although both the fun and the nonsense is often touched with the THE NEW REPUBLIC satirist 's brush . The cabinet , for example , is a collection of types ? the labor official who has to be a man of the people and a born leader simultaneously ; the schoolmarm ; the old politician given to rhetoric and tantrums ; the aging flirt with a touch of the music hall ? and their meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amusement , if not with necessarily ease . The difficulty of staging The Apple Cart is apparent in even so quick a description as the one above . How is a director to handle all the disparate elements and still make sense of the ideas that inform the play ? The current production manages the comedy by treating the play as that bag of tricks that Shaw called it . A LTHOUGH The Apple Cart has de- fects enough , in the end it is an amusing , even an intelligent production . So much can not be said for Major Barbara . It seems incredible that anyone should deliberately choose to destroy Shaw 's play in order , to communicate his message , but such apparently i5 Laughton 's idea . In Major Barbara Shaw is dealing not with the vaudeville stereotypes of The Apple Cart , but with human beings . He is trying to say that before man 's soul or mind or world can be saved , poverty must first be destroyed , but he is saying it , not as a newspaper editorial would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself did say it in his preface . He is saying it in terms of human beings thrown against each other in such a way that they strike out both laughter and tears . The tone of the production is set by Cornelia Otis Skinner as Lady Britomart in the first scene between ? her and Stephen , her son . The first impulse is to blame the monologuist in Miss Skinner , to assume that she plays away from the , other characters , directly to the audience , because she has played solo for so manY years of ladies ' clubs . The fault is not entirely hers , however ; before the play is many minutes old , it is apparent that none of the character- are destined to talk to one another . Laughton 's direction uses the kind of distancing that is supposed to retain the purity of ideas by demolishing emotional identification with the characters . Time after time , the actors step forward , like singers in a grand opera duet or quartet , and talk , DECEMBER 3 1956 side by side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stage freeze into unlikely statues in the back- ground . Laughton 's decision to play Major Barbara as though it were , a cross between The Way of the World and the Living Newspaper , so inhibits his all-star cast that performers who have often done excellent work on other occasions end in disaster . Glynis Johns , who has always seemed uncontrollably ' bubbly and charming in British films , wears Major ? Barbara 's Salvation Army uniform as though it were a ' leaden robe borrowed from the Eighth Circle of Da.nte 's Hell . Frederic Warriner plays ineffectual , pompous Stephen as though he were one part Osric , two parts John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earn'est . Eli Wallach , in perhaps the most fantastic performance in the play , makes Bill Walker look like one of Sid Caesar 's English movie parodies , and Burgess Meredith uses up some of the grimaces and grins that he had left over from his job as Sakini in the National Company of Teahouse of the August Moon . Only Mr. Laughton holds onto any real characterization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more than a ' platform speaker who shifts from a bray to a whisper , knowing the effectiveness of the shift , but without quite realizing that it should have some relation to the speeches themselves . Even as lecture , the production fails because most of the actors , having dispensed with characters , seem incapable of reading the lines intelligently . Meredith and Miss Johns mouth ShaNV 's lines as though they had no meaning at all . This holocaust , performed between two tricky and tiresome all-purpose platforms designed by Donald Oenslager , is the most gratuitous waste of talent on the part of the actors and genius on the part of the author that Broadway has seen in a long time .
