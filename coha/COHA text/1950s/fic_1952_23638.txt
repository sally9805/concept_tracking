Zeke Hamblen A Story by Hazel Heckman Drawings by Oscar Liebman w HEN Syd Benton was . twelve he had as best friend a harelipped boy by the name of Zeke Hamblen . The two boys went everywhere and did everything together . Zeke was absolutely the toughest - boy Syd had ever known . He was n't afraid of anything at all. - He ran out an the highest diving limb and sprang free without a moment 's hesitation , and no tree was too nigh for him to climb for a clump of mistletoe or a crow 's nest . And he could take a rawhiding from Professor Cannon , the school principal , that would have sent any other . bar whimper ing to-his seat ; and not even flinch . He could . also stand up in class when called upon and read a creditable composition from a perfectly blank page . , But Zeke was stubborn , too . If someone wanted him to do something and he did n't want to do it , nothing could make him . Every year on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperance program . The students from all four roomswould crowd together into one room , and Miss Rhinerson , the grammar room teacher , who was a strong prohibition advocate , would give a talk about the evils of drink . Her own father had been a drunkard , and she was very earnest about it . As she talked she would take of . ber - glasses and wipe away the moisture ; and sometimes she would get excited and pound the desk . The year the Hambletts came to Picket Rock to live , the Frances Willard program material , which was sent out from WCTU headquarters , included pledge cards for the male students to sign . Any school that . signed WO per cent of its boys and sent in the cards would receive a large picture of Frances Willard , Miss Rhinerson explained , " suitable for hanging . " .. - Syd signed a card , as did all of the other boys in school except Zeke . Miss Rhinerson worked on him all afternoon , but he still refused to sign . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and when she laid the No tree was too high for him to climb . card in front of him he would n't even look at it . She kept him in at last recess , but he still would n't sign . Her face was splotched with red and as she talked to him she Kept raising her voice . The boys took turns climbing on the fire escape to look through the window and see how things were going . " I 'll bet a nickel he wo n't ever sign , " Gus Ellis said . " He wo n't ever do anything he do n't want to do . " " He 's keeping the whole school from having the picture , " Irma Steffen said . " He 's just doing it to be mean . " " This is a tree country , " Syd said . " You do n't have to sign anything you do n't want to sign . " He could n't help admiring Zeke a little . " Why did n't the girls have to sign ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Irma said . " Made of sugar and spice and everything nice , " Gus said . " I 'll bet my father could get him to sign , " Irma said . She went off with her arm around Jennie Summers . When the students marched back into the building Zeke still sat in his seat . Miss Rhinerson 's mouth was a thin line . She tapped the bell for the students to be seated and got out her grade book . " There 'll be an oral exam in geography , " she said . " Your answers will count 50 per cent of your month 's grade . " She tapped her pencil on the desk to silence the collective groan . Shc fairly snapped out the questions . When she came to Zeke her eyes would move down the list until she came to a hard one . But he always came up with the right answer ; and that made her even madder . It was as though his knowing the answers and giving them with that grin on his face infuriated her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . His eyes were perfectly sober and a little like the eyes of a whipped dog . It was only that his harelip always made him look like he was laughing . T HE following Sunday , Asa Steffen , who was superintendent that year , brought a packet of the pledge cards to Sunday school . It was n't really Temperance Sunday , but he talked about what a fine woman Frances Willard was . His daughter Irma sang , " Father , Dear Father , Come Home with Me Now , " and Asa read off the names of the boys who had signed at school and got the signatures of all the men in the Bible Class . Then he , too , started to work on Zeke . But he did n't get anywhere either . Zeke sat in his seat and stared straight ahead and his face got red . When Asa laid the card in his lap and held the pencil out , Zeke pretended he did n't see them . Asa 's face got as red as a watermelon . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Syd . Syd yelled at him , but Zeke turned into the alley behind the livery stable and walked fast . When Syd tried to catch up with him he started to run .... The next Sunday he did n't show up at Sunday school . He never came back again , not even to get the treat at Christmas time . No one knew exactly where the Hambletts had come from into Picket Rock , nor why they had come there . Most new people came because they had relatives there , but the IIambl etts were n't related to anybody . 1 . Charlie Hamblett , Zeke 's father , a big rawboned man with a red and meaty look , simply got off the four-forty one afternoon and began to look around for a house and a place of business . He talked to Nate Alden , who ran the general store , and to Zack Kaufmann , who ran the livery stable , and finally to Asa Steffen , who , had Picket Rock afforded a Chamber of Commerce , would certainly have been the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hamblett ? " Asa asked Charlie . " Well , I 'm an embalmer by profession , " Charlie said . " But I raise bees and ferrets to make a living . Lately , I 've been thinking about laying in a stock of caskets and shrouds . " It did n't take long for that news to spread . Before night word had gone all over town that the new man was planning to do embalming , a practice some considered to be distinctly heathen . " Well , here 's one man he 'll never get on his table , " Abel Carter , the section boss , said . " Flesh was meant to decay , whether it 's man or beast , and add to the soil , and I do n't believe in anything that slows the process . " Will Bray , the butcher , concurred . " Suppose a man ? was n't really dead , " he said . " Doctors make mistakes . It 's happened before now that a man has come back to life while the womenfolk were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop him off to this Hamblett 's place and he gets his blood all pumped out and his veins filled with formaldehyde , what chance would he have then ? About as much chance as a snowball down in the hot place . " ? But there were those , too , who thought it was all right . They were the progressives . The nearest undertaker lived in a town ten dirt-road miles away , and that was a long way to haul a body in a wagon box . It would be a fine thing to have a man right there in town who could take care of such matters . If Hamblett were to bring in a hearse later , as he had hinted he might , there would n't be any need to call in outside help at all . The progressives liked the thought of Picket Rock being entirely independent of the neighboring towns of Albion and Meade . " I think it 's a real forward step , " Zack Kaufmann said . " Take where the kinfolks have to come from a ways off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping , even in hot weather . Remember the buzzard that followed the procession to the cemetery when Old Man Ebright was buried ? " Everyone remembered the buzzard . U NUKE most boys , Zeke Hamblett never talked about the boys and the school from which he had come , and he brought no report card . On the first day of school he simply climbed the stairs to the grammar room and reported to Miss Rhinerson that he was in the seventh grade . " What grade were you in last year ? " she asked , beginning to look suspicious . Zeke was n't much to look at . His face was fairly clean and his hair was combed after a fashion , but his blue shirt was far from tidy and his corduroy knee-pants had a button missing . And there was his harelip . " I was promoted to the seventh last spring , " he said . " Maybe I should talk to your mother , " Miss Rhinerson said . She looked a little beyond him in order to avoid looking at his harelip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell her to come tomorrow , so you can start where you belong . " " I was promoted to the seventh , " he said . Miss Rhinerson 's long horse face turned a faint pink . " Ask your mother to come in tomorrow , " she said curtly . " She 's not here yet . " " Then you 'll have to write for your report ? card ; or take an examination . " " VII take an examination , " he said , leaving her no choice . It was along toward spring before Mrs. Hamblett put in an appearance . " My mother 's coming tonight , " Zeke told Syd one afternoon at last recess . " I ca n't come out for ball practice . " It was the first time Zeke had ever mentioned his mother . Syd had thought she must be dead . The bell tapped and they took their places in line and started marking time to the beating of the triangle . " Zeke ca n't play tonight , " Syd passed the word along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 'll we do for pitcher ? " Gus asked . He looked sore . The team meant everything to Gus . It was his whole life . " Let 's call it off until tomorrow , " Syd said . " We ca n't play without Zeke , that 's for sure . " " Can Zeke play then ? " " Sure , " Syd said . " He 's only got to meet his mother . " If it had been . Gus 's mother , Gus would have gone ahead and played . Since Gus 's mother had got religion she was n't all there in the head and Gus did n't spend much time around home . When the four-forty came in that afternoon Syd was in front of Nate Alden 's store . When he saw Zeke 's mother get off the train and run along the platform and put her arms around Zeke and stand there rocking him back and forth , Syd looked the other way . He knew Zeke would n't want him watching . But Syd felt tears coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no bigger than a pint of soap , " Nate Alden said . " Imagine a big meaty man like Charlie Hamblett having a little woman like that . He could wrap her right around his little finger . " Nate stood beside Syd and they watched Charlie and Zeke and Mrs. Hamblett get into the hearse , with Mrs. Hamblett 's luggage , and drive . down the road in the direction of the Hamblett house . B EFORE that winter had come to a gusty end with the passing of the spring equinox , Charlie Hamblett had become one of the most indispensable men in Picket Rock . There was only one thing wrong with him . He was a two-bottle man . His self-appointed ration was two pints a day . and he took it neat . But people were wont to look upon this human failing with tolerance , for he never got obnoxious . And he never drank during office hours . " I 'd take a few nips myself , " Zack . Kaufmann said , " if I had his job to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third two-bottle man in Picket Rock was Henry Boner , who kept the lumber yard . That was a bad year for la grippe , and a good many old people and a few of the younger ones dropped off with it in one guise or another . Most of them died of " complications . " With dirt roads almost bottomless from melting snows , grateful citizens found how handy it was to have an undertaker right at home in Picket Rock , and a stock of plush-covered caskets to choose from . And Charliewas honest ; his prices were plainly marked . It was true that he had several sets of printed price cards ; and if the bereaved family were what was known as well-to-do , he would send Zeke around the back way to distribute the higher-bracket figures over the stock . But if the family were hard up he frequently marked the caskets below cost . This practice of Charlie 's , while pretty well known , was not really resented ; for customers had only to check the much higher prices charged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't taking , even from the well-to-do , any very great profit for his undertaking . Prior to Charlie 's coming , the poorer people of the community had frequently been forced to make do with strong boxes nailed up at Henry Boner 's lumber yard ; but now , thanks to Charlie , caskets were within reach of even the most humble , corpse . Now there were both coffin and strong box . As soon as the grave was dug , by kindly neighbors of the deceased , Charlie and Henry , who had become great cronies , could be seen pulling up the bill to the cemetery in Henry 's old Hanna wagon to set the strong box . Sometimes the trip took a long while and the two friends were not so very steady on the spring seat when they came down again . But Charlie always managed to be as sober as a judge by service time , standing correct and funereal in his black coat and white gloves to direct the lowering of the coffin on its harness lines . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to town , " Mrs. Tom Summers said warmly . " He conducts one so nice . " When a mix-up set a protracted meeting of the first M. E. church and a Picket Rock funeral service at the same hour , depriving the service of the usual mixed quartet , Charlie amazed the townsfolk by arising quietly and singing " Lead , Kindly Light " in a whiskey tenor . " Was n't he just marvelous ? " Mrs. Summers remarked to her husband . " Did you ever hear of an undertaker singing at a funeral ? " " Well , I do n't know why he should n't be the one to sing , " Tom retorted . " He 's the only one who 's getting anything out of it . " But he said it kindly . He knew Charlie was n't getting much . T HAT summer after Mrs. Hamblett came home , Syd Benton spent a good deal of time at the Hamblen house . Charlie and Mattie Hamblett treated him like a grownup , and he liked that . And he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beehive suppers , and Mrs. Hamblea 's bright quince preserves and her big brown sugar cookies . And the embalming equipment , installed in the driveway of Charlie 's spacious haybarn , filled Syd with a morbid fascination . The barn was airy and clean , and the drive- way , which was protected overhead , made a fine place for Charlie to work . There were bins for grain storage on either side , and a tall stationary ladder led to the hayloft . At either end of the driveway large square doors hung on rollers that moved smoothly along a track , so that the place could be closed off overnight in case it were necessary to keep a body there . In cold weather these doors , which were fitted with windows for light , could be rolled shut and in summer they could be left open , creating a pleasant , well ventilated breezeway where there was always enough breeze to keep flies to a minimum . Syd had never seen Charlie at work at his embalming , for he forbade the boys to watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the breezeway ; and Zeke had explained to Syd in detail the embalming process . It seemed very simple , as Zeke told it , and the furnishings were plain and functional . Frequently , when there was to be a funeral , Syd went with Zeke to the church to help with the tolling of the hell , one tap , at minute intervals , for each year of the deceased 's age . The tolling of the bell was a service Charlie Hamblett supplied to his customers free of charge and he made it plain to Zeke that the tolling and the counting were a grave responsibility and that he must make no mistake . Sometimes Syd did the tolling and Zeke the marking off of the number of tolls and sometimes Syd did the marking and Zeke the ringing . They did it solemnly and carefully , acutely conscious of a vast counting audience on the outside . I T WAS not until after Syd had been going to the Hamblens ' for some time that he began to notice that there was something queer about Mattie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small woman , " wiry , " people called her , and filled with energy . It was she who tended the ferrets and the bees while Charlie was away ; and her courage in the midst of angry swarms of bees Charlie arose quietly and sang " Lead , Kindly Light " in a whiskey tenor .. filled Syd with the same kind of admiration he had for Zeke 's fearlessness . Syd saw Mrs. Hamblett scoop masses of roaring bees into the bare cupped palms of her hands and deposit them in the hives , the way you would dip into beans or raisins . He never saw her stung . Its because she 's not afraid , " Zeke explained . " The bees know that , the way dogs know when you 're afraid . If you 're afraid the bees can smell the fraid on you and they sting you because they do n't have any respect for afraid people . " But sometimes when Syd went to Hambletts ' , Mrs. Hamblen would n't be doing anything at all . Her face would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her words come out more garbled than Zeke 's did with his harelip . She would look at Syd as though she did not see him at all and smile and go on mumbling to herself . Zeke would pay no attention to her ; but go to the big red Tiger tobacco can and take out a handful of cookies for Syd and another for himself and the two boys would go on out to play . The first time that happened Syd asked Zeke , " Is your mother sick ? " " No , she 's not sick , " Zeke said . He turned a flip and hung by his toes over an apple limb . " I'II bet I can eat a cookie and swallow it uphill faster than you can . " Well , maybe it was fits , Syd thought . One of Gus Ellis ' sisters had fits . But she always screamed and wet her pants and then turned as gray as wood ashes and passed out . Whereas Mrs. Hamblett was red and all she did was to mutter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syd found out that when Mrs. Hamblett acted that way she was drunk . Zeke and Syd were hanging around Alden 's store one day when Henry Boner came waddling across from the lumber yard . " I 've got that deaf we spoke of all arranged , Charlie , " he said . " You can get it by the hogshead for less than half , and it 's good strong stuff . " He grinned at the two boys . " Got a kick like Kernoodle 's mule . " Charlie leaned back in his swivel chair . " I ca n't , " he said . " I just ca n't . I 'm sure much obliged to you for your trouble , Henry . But it 's like I told you . I just do n't dare place temptation in her path . She 's been at the cure three times now , and me and Zeke need her here at home . I 'm a big man . I can soak it up like a sponge and never feel it . But she 's too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it be . " " Well , I 've got a plan , " Henry said . " It came to me last night in bed . Mrs. Hamblett 's a small woman , I told myself , and not so very stout . " " For her size , " Charlie broke in , " Mattie 's the stoutest little woman you ever saw . " " Sure she is , " Henry agreed . " She sure is . For her size . And fine goods always conies in small packages as the saying goes . . . But there you have it . If you were to hang this hogshead From a rope over a pulley out in your embalming place , nobody would be stout enough to let it down and hoist it up but you and me . " Charlie was silent . " If Nellie was n't so simon-pure , " Henry said , " I 'd keep it down to my place . But she 's a regular Carrie Nation when it comes to booze . I can keep a demijohn hid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie gazed thoughtfully down the quiet dusty street . " She hardly ever goes there , " he said . " She do n't like the place . " " It 's not likely she 'd ever see it , " Henry said . " if she did , she 'd likely think it was some of your pickling rig . And if she were to untie the rope , which she would n't , she 'd be took up to the rafters like a kite in high wind . She would n't risk that . " " No , she 'd know better than to try that , " Charlie agreed . " It would seem like a kind of dirty trick , though . Putting it up high so we could have it all to ourselves . " " You could let her have a little , " Henry said . " Portion it out to her from time to time . Whatever you thought she ought to have . " " It 's what I do , " Charlie said . " I guess it would n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Green Front asks . Mattie 's taking the eggs into town Saturday . If I were to drive around by , you reckon we could get the hogshead in the hearse ? " T WAS Syd and Zeke who found her . Obvi-ously she had been in search of a hidden nest and had climbed onto the embalm-ing table and over into the bin . Her market basket , half filled with brown eggs , had been left outside in the breezeway and her ging-ham sunbonnet had Fallen to the ground . The hogshead was still snugged tight against the rafters , the way Charlie and Henry had left it , the rope wrapped tight around a beam and the bung driven fast into the bunghole . But Charlie 's squirrel rifle lay on the floor , and beside the bunghole in the hogshead an-other hole had been drilled , through which the contents had drained and filled to over-flowing the galvanized washing tub that had been set on the floor especially to receive it . Mrs. Hamblett sat on a pile of oats bags , her pale brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys she began to smile foolishly and to mutter to herself . Zeke picked up the gun and looked to see whether it were loaded , and then set it carefully in a corner . " Give me a hand with the tub , will you , Syd ? " he requested . " She 'll keep after it if I leave it here . " The two boys dragged the tub to the edge of the bin and dumped the contents through the grain door . A strong smell of whiskey arose and made Syd cough . Mrs. Hamblett began to cry softly . " Let 's go to the house and scramble some eggs , " Zeke said . He climbed out of the oats bin and picked up the egg basket , skirted the embalming table , and set off up the path . " Are n't you going to do anything about your mother ? " Syd called after him . Syd remembered all of the times he had seen her smiling and muttering and knew now that she had been drunk . But he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She 'll be all right . " Syd followed Zeke into the neat kitchen . Four fresh loaves of bread stood on the table , and the Tiger tobacco can was filled with big round sugar cookies . Zeke washed his hands and dried them on the roller towel . He did not act as though anything had happened . He lit a gas jet and took the spider from its nail on the wall and adjusted the flame underneath . Then he started breaking eggs into a bowl , cracking them on the edge of the zinc-topped table . " Look , " Syd said . " Why do n't you come home with me for supper , Zeke ? " He thought uneasily of Charlie 's return and the discovery of the loss of his whiskey . And he thought of Mrs. Hamblett crying on the oats bags . " No , " Zeke said . " I 'd better stay . " He broke the yolks with a spoon and ladled a scoopful of soft lard into the smoking spider and poured in the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
