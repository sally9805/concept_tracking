ON HIS native soil the Kerry blue is a shaggy blue-black animal , a tittle short on leg , purposeful and reticent , and a fierce fighter . So was our Kerry blue in Paris , above all shaggy , and we were very proud . The Parisians arc exceptionally fond of dogs ; they are also inexhaustibly curious about the diversity of the creations of God , or the Supreme Being . For both those reasons our Kerry blue attracted a good deal of attention . It was therefore nothing exceptional when the stout lady , proprietress of the restaurant in the Place NotreDame-des-Victoires , came over and asked what it was , as a dog . I told her it was an Irish dog , of a race unknown in France . To this she replied that she had an Irish dog herself , and went and got it . She produced with pride a rather impressive beast , trim and tufted , resembling an exceptionally tough poodle and having about it that suggestion of the sinister which the combination of physical strength and marked elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced I ad-mired the stranger . He was , ere I confessed , superb as an Irish dog but , I was ashamed to say , I did not recognize the breed . The reply was crushing : " Mais , mon pauvre monsieur , Eat um des races les rule+ , conrores de chiens iilundars ! Cost as Carey Bloom ! " There were , she revealed , only three " Carey Blooms " in all Paris : her dog , a bitch in the Avenue Henri Martin , and another dog in the Boulevard Raspail ; but in the last case she thought the district cast doubt upon the pedigree . I couldhave added to the list , but found it too hard to explain that my own dog also was striving , in his woolly way , to be a Carey Bloom . I got two things out of this encounter : a new name for my dog and a new place to take Irish visitors in Paris . Irish people in Paris , like other visitors , want to plumb the depths of French wickedness and perversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know a depth when they plumb one . The dog of the Place Notre-Dame-desVictoires was a good answer to this sort of thing . He constituted visible and tangible evidence of French perversity , in a form which any Irish per-son could understand . " When I look at that dog , " said one of the Irish visitors , " I understand the Fall of France . " His cup was full when I revealed that the dog had belonged to Andre Gide , when he lived in the Rue Vaneau . As the beast sneered at them across the cafe table , my friends found it easy to believe themselves in tire presence of a disciple of Gide 's . Only that diabolical brain , surely , could have conceived the project of tonsuring a Kerry blue into the semblance of a poodle . I always meant to survey the field completely , to visit the pedigree bitch of the Avenue Henri Martin and the attainted dog of the Boulevard Raspail , but my newspaper decided otherwise . My new editor felt that the Irish people were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in what was happening in Donnycarney : I was to come home , quickly . This raised a difficulty : what about Carey Bloom ? It is very easy to bring a dog from Ireland ( or England ) to France : you just bring it . But to bring a dog back from France to Ireland or England is quite a different matter . You must , to begin with , obtain a license to import a Canine . If you get this you must , on arrival in Ireland , hand aver the Canine , in an approved Nose-andPaw-proof Receptacle , to an approved place of Quarantine , there to be confined for Six Calendar Months , at cost to owner of ? 2 a week . Then , if the dog is still alive , you can have him . All this is understood to be required to keep the scourge of rabies out of Ireland and , of course , England . The French , however , have a different story . It became clear that there were three courses possible : 1 . To leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ireland complying with the Regulations . 3 . To bring him to Ireland without complying with the Regulations . The first course I should have favored myself , but it was ruled out by my two small daughters . The second course found no supporters : it would probably kill or at least disable the dog , and it would also cost us more than ? 50 ; the sentimentalists and the realists united in rejecting any such policy . It was therefore decided , by elimination , that Course 3 was to be adopted . Carey Bloom was to be smuggled , and I was to do the smuggling . This wm a mare formidable and dangerous task than at first appears . In Ireland it is the Department of Agriculture that administers these laws . And it has been said that there are only two forces worth mentioning in Ireland : the Church and the Department of Agriculture . I risked not merely a heavy fine and a jail sentence , but also the loss of my job . Then hope dawned . I did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . England and Ireland , politically , are fractured , but to the veterinarian they are still one and indivisible . If Carey Bloom were once in England , he could be brought to Ireland without fuss or formality . And even if I were caught smuggling into England , it would be by Englishmen , having broken an English regulation , and pos-sessing therefore a sacred claim on the sympathy of my own countrymen . Even my newspaper would have to back me up ; my friends could see to that . If it failed me it would be accused of play-Mg England 's game , and then let it look to its circulation ! In good spirits , then , I prepared for the attack . My family went ahead by air , leaving me with the car and Carey Bloom . My last dinner in Paris I took in the Place Notre-Dame-des-Victoires . The stout lady , pleased at what I had done for thereputation of her dog and house , gave mc photographs of both . The picture of the dog had been taken at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cuff table , with a hideous exprcssion of intelligence , in the middle of a lively group ; he had a glass of Pernod in front of him and four saucers ? a surprising number , for he drank very little . On the wall behind , someone had taken care to hang a portrait of M. Gide . To a man facing , perhaps , an English prison on the morrow , it all seemed a little childish , and yet endearing . They put me to bed on the premises . MY START on the following morning was not as early as it should have been , one my head as clear . It was eight o'clock when , with Carey Bloom up-right in the seat beside me , I left Paris by the Porte de Ncuilly , on the road to Dieppe . I stopped at Pontoisc to consult the local vet . My plans in-volved putting Carey Bloom in a case , and the case in the boot of the car ; anyone who knew re Corey Bloom realized that this could hardly be done without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the patient were unconscious . The wit of Pontoise was large , sporty ' , and Ws gentleman ? with crew cut . He was also in full sympathy with my project . The English quarantine laws were a piece of cynical hypocrisy . La rage canine was , without doubt , a very terrible disease , but did I know when the last case of it had been notified in France ? No ? Eh Men , mon pauvre monsieur , the last case of is rage canine in France occurred in 1910 ! Din . . . neat . . . rent . . . die ! Under President Fallihres ! Had I so much as met anyone who had even heard of President Fallihrcs ? No ? Well , then ! The vet of Pontoise was striding up and down the room , . breathing heavily . I tried to bring him hack to the immediate practical aspects of the problem : I had a boat to catch , needed instructions on dog-doping , and the dope itself . " None of that , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real reason for the quarantine regulations ? It is that the dog breeders of England fear the French competition ? and Dutch competition perhaps a little too ? " " My boat goes , " I said , " at 12:30 , and if you could give me some pills , something that would work quickly ? " The vet stopped walking and looked me sternly in the eye . " Of course I will give you the pills , " he said . ' VW noun pales pas . Vous auez largement is temps . " I looked at my watch , with gathering hopelessMSS . " It is admirably simple , " said the vet of POOtoisr . " Suppose there is a minister who is an hon-est man and who says , ' You arc breaking my feet with your silly regulations about quarantine for dogs : I wilt abolish them ! ' Nan ! So what happens ? One dog breeder rings up his brother , the governor of the BBC . Another calls his uncle , the editor of the Times . A third takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. ' " So all the hysterical old women of England that is 40 million out of a total population of 50 million ? get together and make some brouhaha . They say : Keep out French Diseases ! They say : A Vote for Labor Is a Vote for Rabies ! Then one clay the minister gets up in the House and says the question needs further study , and he sets up a commission of dog breeders ' brothers to study it ! As for you , monsieur , bore are four tablets of Gardenal . Give the animal one not more than half an hour before embarkation ; give him the other three on the boat ? just put them in his mouth , he 'll swallow them . You 've nothing at all totorry about ? he 'll sleep like a woodcutter , and the customs people in England are the same as our own , they never look at anything . " Out in the yard the vet of Pontoise who refused any payment ? took a good look at Carey Bloom . " He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were properly trimmed . " Having no time for this controversy , I got into the car and prepared to turn into the Street . " Of course , " said the vet , " I know that in England they like dogs to be like that . They have the mania of the natural . It is perhaps , " he added thoughtfully , " a form of hypocrisy . " As I drove through the Vexin on the road to Dieppe I felt considerably fortified by the vet 's rcinarks . His expmure of the economic ' basis of the quarantine regulations was convincing enough  --  allowing for French hyperbole ? and it conferred on my own enterprise an agreeable touch of righteousness . I was encouraged , furthermore , by what he had said about the laxity of the customs examination . It was only in Dieppe itself , driving clown to the port , at noon , that the brightness of this vision began to fade . I realized that I was a half hour late , and that the doping of Carey Bloom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two simultaneous problems to solve rapidly : to get the car on hoard , and m dope Carey Bloom . principe , cars are not accepted at all , unless presented an hour before departure . And it was now ? successive officials pointed out ? thirty minutes . , twenty minutes ... ten minutes before departure . French officials , once they have logically established the utter impossibility of some course of action , usually like to show that they , being elite personalities , can none the less do it , this impossible thing , and the formalities in this case were pushed through with surprising speed . This involved , however , running up many steps and gangways , and the frequent assumption of that air of harassed and apologetic helplessness that , for the French official , is the mark of a de-scrying member of the public . In between these interviews I had repeatedly to get back to the car for an even more difficult argument , with Carey Bloom . Carey Bloom is a patient dog , and he did not at all object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the tablet in his mouth and hold his massive jaws together . He would look at me sadly but uncomplainingly , his eyes deep violet pools under the blue shadow of his shaggy brows . Then , when I let go my hold , Carey Bloom would deposit a white and glistening object on the seat of the car . The ultimate official , who came to the car with the cleared papers , seven minutes before departure time , found me still clutching Carey Bloom 's head , the two of us staring at each other fixedly . The official mistook this for a display of Anglo-Saxon sentimentality and disapproved . " You had better get your car on board immediately , " he said . " You need not fear seasickness , either for yourself or your dog . The sea is perfectly calm . But hurry in the name of God . " There was clearly now no question of putting Carey Bloom into a suitcase and the suitcase into the boot of the car . That , and the doping , would have to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed Carey Bloom onto the floor in front of the seat and covered him with a rug . The result looked depressingly She a dog covered with a rug . I drove to the ship 's side and sat in the ear waiting to be hauled aboard . But a face , covered with soft coal , appeared at the window , and spoke : " You are not , monsieur , by chance a member of the Union of French Stevedores and Port Workers , affiliated to the CGT ? No ? In that ease , monsieur , perhaps you would be good enough to hand me the key of your car , and proceed , yourself , on foot , on board the boat . I will take your place at the wheel and will occupy myself with the loading of your car . You can be tranquil . " I got out , as tranquilly as I could , but I did not proceed on board the boat . I waited . In a retnarkably short time the stevedore was out again , jumping up and down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , paid to be bitten by dogs . It was not the Queen of England who ruled in France , and French workers had rights , for which , through their syndicates , they knew how to enforce respect . Other members of dm Union of French Stevedores and Port Workers , gathered round , agreed with these views . Iwas not impressed , because I knew the man had not been bitten . Persons who had been bitten by Carey Bloom stayed bitten ; they did not jump up and down in this frivolous manner , conversing about the Rights of Man and of the Citizen . I explained , and demonstrated , that the dog was sage and gentle . As for myself I owed no more allegiance to the Queen of England than they did , being a good Irish Republican . In fact , the dog was there in defiance of an English regulation ? a regulation , moreover , which was unfairly aimed at French exports and was devised to protect the private interests of the English four hundred families , including Sir Eden himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs , saw my point of view . He would put car and dog aboard : " Once there you are in England . The sailors are all English and capable of anything . They are all little bourgeois , Calvinists , and police spies . " How right he was I found in a very few minutes , aboard the S.S. Black Prince . It was a fine clear day with a dead calm sea , but no sooner had my car been hoisted onto the lower deck , and the French stevedore departed , than a company of Calvinists descended with a huge tarpaulin . Silently , with grim efficiency , they lashed this covering into position over the car , securing it tightly . A small gap remained between the lower edges of the tarpaulin and the deck ; as a window of the car teas open , air could still penetrate to Carey Bloom . But only air ; no question now of the leisurely administration of drugs , no question of a doped dog sleeping quietly in the boot . No possibility of tampering with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpaulin-tamperer , which I was not . The seamen might not all be Tory police spies , as the French stevedore claimed , but they had a look about them of belonging to that class of men who are described as " late-abiding " because they like to see other people getting into trouble . I made my way to the bar , for a Guinness . The barman , I found with pleasure , was an Irishman , even a Kerryrnan ? Mahoney by name ? and therefore by definition indifferent to the law , " our pets , " and the public health of England . He heard my story gravely . No , nothing to be done with those seamen . All non-Catholics , mostly Methodists , do n't smoke and do n't drink , would inform on their own mother . The only help he could give , the Kcrryman said , was with the Nose-haven dockers . These were a decent crowd , that is to say , mostly Irish , who could be trusted to keep quiet if it was made worth their while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the ear and dqg quietly off the boat and as far as the customs shed . After that I was on my own . He thought the chances were about flee to one against my getting through . You would be better off in England poisoning old women , the barman thought , than to be caught smuggling a dog . However , he would do his best for me , and wished me luck . AT Newhaven , the dockers did their part , as arranged through the barman . I drove slowly along the quayside , using one hand to pull the rug back over Carey Bloom . Carey Bloom , normally a very quiet dog , growled and shook the rug off . I pulled it back again , wishing I were in some quiet English watering place , respected by all , happily poisoning old women . Carry Bloom stayed under the rug this time , but shivering and sniffling . I reached the customs shed . The customs shed ( motor vehicles ) at Newhaven is a building I now know rather Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and echoes . There are a few officials there , but it is difficult to make them out at first , so still are they in the uncertain light of the great windowless hall . You make them out , however , as you go along . One of them now came forward : the Automobile Association , a ginger haired man with that touch of slightly furtive affability that marks the man who has one leg in the official world and another in that of private enterprise . He would clear the car papers while the other customs formalities scent through ; it would only take a few minutes . He took my triptyque and disappeared into the shadows . Several minsites passed in a silence broken only by an occasional whimper . Then suddenly H. M. Customs was beside Inc : a friendly fresh-faced man with an outdoorlook about him and a perfunctory sort of expression which I liked even better . " Anything to declare ? " " No , I 'm in transit to Ireland ? going an to Holyhead tonight . " " Nothing intended far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or perfume ? " " Nothing at all . " " All right , sir , you can carry on . " My car began to move forward as on its own initiative toward the exit of the cavern , toward freedom and success . Its lights shone on a ginger-haired man : the Automobile Association . He waved ; I stopped . They were a little slow clearing the papers ? the usual man was away ? would mind waiting where I was for a few minutes ? By this time H. M. Customs had strolled up , benevolently , aman with time on his hands . I wanted to say that I with like to wait anywhere except where I seas , but I bad some difficulty in finding suitable words for this thought . I said I would wait . FE M. Customs decided to keep me company . He was a fisherman , and it was his opinion that the best fishing in the world was to he found in Connemara . Or perhaps Donegal . Though Lough Derg , in Limerick , at dapping time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself under his rag . At least I hoped it was under his rug . I had a hideous feeling that the rug by now had slipped off . But it was impossible to look round . All I could she was to trust to the dim light and try to make intelligent answers about dry-fly fishing in the west of Ireland . A figure appeared , moving briskly from the direction of the exit . The Automobile Association ! The figure came closer . It was not the Automobile Association , It seas more of H. M. Customs . More , and older , and nastier . " Have you cleared this car ? " he asked my fisherman friend . There was a slight Scots edge on his voice , and a singularly unpleasant inflection to it . The remark had an unfortunate effect on Fisherman . He dropped the subject of the May fly on Lough Derg and took a quick look inside the car . Then his manner changed . " I 'm afraid , sir , " he said quietly , " I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that question was going to he . " Are you carrying any animals in this car , sir ? " " No , " I replied firmly . " Since you declare you are carrying no animals , sir , perhaps you smuld tell we what that is ? " I looked round , for the first time . Carey Bloom 's muzzle and two front paws were resting on the front scat . His shoulders were covered with a tartan rug . He seas asleep . " That , " I said , " is my dog . " " Since you admit that is your dog , sir , " said the Scot , " how do you explain your previous declaration that youwere carrying no animals ? " Clearly he felt that this was a telling piece of cross-examination . Privately I agreed with him , but I decided to go clown fighting . " This dog is being conveyed to Ireland , " I said . In Ireland he will be put in quarantine immediately . I am taking him direct to Holyhead . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . All your previous questions were about what I had for the United Kingdom . I took it that this question as the same . As I had no animals intended for thc United Kingdom . I thought it was right to answer the question in the negative . " Fisherman 's mouth hung open , like that of a ' , ugh Derg trout in dapping nine . He was obviously dazzled by this unexpected piece of dialectic . There was a silence . I was weak enough to break the silence by a conciliatory remark . I should have known better than to make a conciliatory remark to a Scot , but my nerves had been under a strain for some time . " I should prefer to take him to Ireland for quarantine , " I said , " but of course , if that would be contrary to your regulations I 'm perfectly prepared to put him into quarantine here . " I thought this a fair offer , but it brought out the worst in the Scot . " You do n't seem to r-realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a question of what you unprepared or not prepared to do . The animal , of course , will be impounded , and may be committed to quarantine if the authorities are satisfied as to your willingness and ability to pay for his upkeep . Otherwise he will be dest-r-royed . The fact is that you yourself have already committed two very serious offenses : first by importing a dog without a license and second by falsely declaring that you were not carrying animals . On either count you are liable on summary conviction both to a heavy fine and to a p-r-risen sentence of not more than Six Months . I shall now have to report the matter both to the police and to my own superiors . You , sir , will please remain where you are and ensure that that animal does not leave the Car until he is officially impounded . " THE program for the evening was faithfully observed . The police arrived and took a statement . And later came an overalled contingent with a handcart on which stood a large crate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plague rear . To them , not without a twinge , I handed over Carey Bloom . He licked my hand in farewell , but otherwise made no sign . As they wheeled him away , toward imprisonment or death , I sate on the back of his crate a huge sign in yellow characters : ? Axonal RABIES ! I thought bitterly of President Fallieres . I became aware at the same time that a new character , and one having authority , had come on the scene . This was an elderly man , not in uniform but in sports coat and flannels . The old gentleman 's general appearance was kindly and paternal , but I could see from his expression that he had Very Little Sympathy for Certain Classes of Offender and that I belonged to one such class . " I 'm afraid , " he said , " that in view of what 's happened we 'll have to put some further questions to you formally . After that we 'll have to search your car thoroughly . You see you 've already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive normal tourist treatment . " He left a moment for this insult to sink in Then : " Ate you carrying any Narcotic Drugs ? " " No . " " Any Plants or Pat-rots ? " " Any Arms or Ammunition ? " " Any more animals ? " This was too much . " Look , " I said , " I 'm nos a professional dog smuggler , or any other kind of smuggler . That dog belongs to my daughters , who arc very fond of it . If it had to go into quarantine I wanted to bring it to Ireland . If it were quarantined there they could visit it every day . As it is they wo n't be able to visit it at all . I 'm sorry if I infringed your regulations , and you can go ahead and search my car . You wo n't find anything . " For the first time since coming to Newhaven I had managed to strike the right note . The old gentleman 's manner perceptibly softened . He made no reply , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I had said , to he free from Narcotic Drugs , Arms , Ammunition , Plants , Parrots , and Other Animals . He addressed mc now as a fellow human being , rather than as an individual engaged in a Vile Traffic . " I can understand your feeling for your Pct , " Ise said . " I have three dogs of my own . But , believe me , it 's in the interests of Our Pcts themselves to see that these regulations are observed . " He lit a cigarette , for effect . Then quietly : " Have you ever seen a case of rabies ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm afraid I have n't . You see the last case of rabies in France was in 1910 . The year of the Coronation of King George V. That was before I was horn . " Balked of his dramatic effect , the old gentleman looked at me thoughtfully . " We do n't want to be unnecessarily severe about this , " he said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can avoid it . I 'm quite prepared to accept your story , send the dog to an approved place of quarantine in England , and let you go on your way , without further formality . So if you 'll just show me the license from the Eire Department of Agriculture to import the dog into Ireland , IN C can regard the matter as closed . " The Scot , who had looked depressed during the earlier part of this speech , cheered up at the end perceptibly and unpleasantly . He could obviously see , merely by looking at me , that I possessed no licenses of any kind . He was quite right . " I did n't have time to get a license , " I said . " I was ordered by my employers to come home at very short notice indeed . My first idea was to leave the dog with some French people , who would give it a home for a time , while I made the necessary arrangements in Dublin for its importation . Then at the very last moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home was quite unsuitable . I could n't just abandon the dog , so I decided to take him to Ireland and hand him over for quarantine there . I do n't think the Irish authorities , in the circumstances , would have made too many difficulties about there being no license . " The Scot smiled . What he thought of my story was quite clear . But his superior , the owner of three dogs , looked puzzled . He would , at least , not condemn me out of hand . " You say you found this home was unsuitable , " he said . " Now just what do you mean by that ? " " Well , " I replied , feeling better , " you see , the man who offered to take care of the dog was a Frenchman , a cafe proprietor . My dog is a Kerry blue ? you know the breed , I expect ? and this man said he owned a Kerry blue , too . That made me think he would know how to look after my dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , to be on the safe side , I decided to go and have a look at his dog . This is what I found . " I handed over the photograph of the dog of Place Notre-Dame-des-Victoires . The three customs men studied it . The two Englishmen were visibly affected . They seemed like men peering into an abyss . It was the old gentleman who spoke . " Do you mean that they give this unfortunate dog . . . drink ? " " Pernod , " said I quietly . " Then they make him do tricks for the customers . " " Do you know , " said the old gentleman , " I would n't have believed it , even of the French . " One felt that moral condemnation had reached its ultimate . He examined the picture again for some time , then handed it back . " I ca n't condone breaking regulations , " he said , " but I must say that if I had to choose between breaking a regulation and leaving my dog with a man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll recommend no further action . I with you good luck and you can be sure your dog will be well looked after . " It was the Scot who showed me past the police , to the Automobile Association and freedom . The Automobile Association , in an undertone , wanted to know what had happened . The Scot told him : " The gentleman made a false declaration to the customs and was caught in possession of contraband , " he said . " He gets off under English law because he once knew a poodle that took to the drink . Good night . "
