Tristram von der Fingern Lachen sneered down his wrinkled nose at the pampered dandies around him . His aristocratic toilet-a bath in olive oil and a dousing with detergent-had been completed at home . Great Danes are just too big to do all of their primping in public . But smaller breeds in the Westminster Kennel Club show at Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden last week turned the rank and echoing Garden cellar into a tonsorial riot . Handlers and owners worked over their charges like anxious mothers . Long hair was stripped and scissored , combed and brushed ; paws were groomed . " Of course it 's illegal , " muttered one handler vigorously covering black smudges with cornstarch . " But what in hell are you supposed to do when you have to travel 500 miles with a white poodle ? " <P> Perambulating mops known as Yorkshire terriers had their fragile silken locks bound up in wax paper and rubber bands whenever they were out of the ring ; often they wore woolen booties to keep from scratching up their own coiffures . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Swan , a tiny ( just 6 Ibs. ) four-year-old poodle , patiently put up with hours of clipping , shearing , shampooing ( with bluing ) , and . of course , the inevitable , endless bout with brush and comb . Some 70 toy poodles , including eight of Wilber 's get , stole the show . <P> The U.S. is in the midst of a toy-poodle vogue . The carefully trimmed bundles of fluff* have been dogs of fashion since the days of Queen Anne . In the U.S. poodles took a long time catching on . Only 50 of them were registered in the American Kennel Club by 1930 . Not until the early 1950s did dog lovers in large numbers discover that poodles are as bright and companionable as they are susceptible to ostentatious hairdos . Last year there were 16,691 registered with the A.K.C. <P> A proud toy-poodle owner , who also happens to be a hi-fi fan , tried to explain the phenomenon at the Garden last week : " This is one more sign of what you might call sophistication for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog : no suggestion of proletarian practicality ; no good for hunting , at least not any more ; no good for herding sheep ; no good for tracking convicts . The American people are getting more of the good things in life all the time-things that used to belong to the aristocracy : sailboats , golf , good music . Why not poodles ? The poodle vogue is something like hi-fi-or maybe I should say hi-fido . " <P> In the competition , such sturdy animals as Tristram the Great Dane and Dryad 's Conversation Piece , a Newfoundland , dropped out early , their only consolation the blue ribbons in their own classes . When the call went out for best in show , Wilber White Swan strutted onstage like a cocksure ham , flaunting his dog 's conviction that he was a lot more of a dog than the other finalists-the boxer , the bloodhound , the English setter , the standard poodle and the Sealyham . The judge 's vote made Wilber the first toy dog ever to win the high award . He may have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Long Island Dog Breeder Bertha Smith , he is a practical animal indeed . Said she proudly : " Wilber 's stud fee will jump from $250 to $350 . " <P>
