When Art Freeman , Wichita oil operator , launched Dan Hodge , the intercollegiate wrestling champion , as an amateur boxer last fall ( SI , Nov. 18 ) he promised , " We are n't ever going to do anything that might make Dan ridiculous .... He 's going to go at his own speed , and if he ever decides he 's had enough , or if he gets hurt , he can stop . " // Last week Art Freeman 's promise looked pretty good . Hodge had won his first 15 fights ( 11 by knockout ) and had wrapped up the heavyweight championship of the western team of the Golden Gloves . At no time had he appeared ridiculous , and " his own speed " was near that of a sputnik . // To Dan Hodge the road to boxing fame had been short and successful . He found boxing neither harder nor easier than wrestling , " just different . " // While waiting for his big fight in Chicago last week he explained the difference . " In wrestling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tense ; in boxing you keep them loose and agile . That 's what I 've been doing , loosening up my muscles  --  jabbing long , working on my combinations , not pulling with my muscles like I would be in wrestling . " // Another difference : " In boxing , you 're working for two or three minutes , then rest a minute . In college wrestling , you work nine minutes before you get a rest . " // In running up a string of 46 consecutive collegiate wrestling victories  --  including 36 pins ( 23 in a row )  --  Hodge rarely had to work nine minutes . " My average last year , " he admits , " was around 1:33. " // Curt Kennedy , the professional trainer who is in charge of conditioning Dan , is concentrating on converting the fighter 's extraordinary strength from wrestling to boxing . " He has tremendous natural power , " says Kennedy . " He 's just learning to utilize that power . " // So far Dan has little style in the ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break through with one of his knockout punches . // The thing he finds hardest to master in his three-and-a-half-hour daily workouts with sparring partner Johnny Gray are combinations  --  and he has n't learned them yet . // His opponent last week was 20-year-old Louis Coleman , whose own brother dropped out of a Golden Gloves preliminary against Louis in order to clear the way for him . Coleman was  --  and is  --  a much better boxer than Hodge and has a relatively strong punch . // At the outset of the fight , Hodge dropped his right arm and crouched , much like a knight on horseback about to ram his lance through a dragon . Then , for a moment , he shifted into a wrestler 's crouch , arms lowered and in front of him , circling warily . When he came up , Coleman began outboxing him smartly , holding him off and landing punches cleanly and sharply . Hodge tried to move in , arms milling awkwardly . // " Do n't wrestle , " warned Referee Bernard Weissman . Once one of Hodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his chest , slightly below the neck . Coleman hesitated , looked surprised and obviously " learned humility . " But by the end of the first round , Coleman was clearly in command . // There is a desire to win in Dan Hodge that is as strong as the man himself . At the start of the second round , he began working on Coleman 's body . Coleman again was boxing sharply and effectively  --  until about midway through the round . Then he wilted , apparently unable to resist Hodge 's superior strength . Hodge shoved him around the ring  --  quite literally  --  and won the round . // In the third , Coleman came back , but he no longer had strength or accuracy . He did not appear as tired as in the second round  --  but neither did he appear ready to take the initiative . Hodge won the round , the fight and the championship . // Afterward , as he sat at ringside sipping a Coke and repeatedly sneezing and blowing his nose , Hodge reconstructed the fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second round and again in the middle of the third  --  and remember where I was and think , ' I 've got to get my combinations going , ' " he said . He blew his nose again with annoyance . " It must be an allergy , maybe dust from the ring mat . " But later he acknowledged that he might have been chilled because " the locker room seemed a little cool . " // Next day Dan took off for New York to train for his Golden Gloves championship fight with Charles Hood , the eastern champion . Freeman returned to Wichita and his oil business , but before he left he said : " He really did n't fight a good fight last night . He seems to freeze up a little before big crowds the crowd in Chicago Stadium : 11,136 . But he 's a tiger in the gym . They 'll love him at Stillman's. " // Hodge will train for the finals at Stillman 's . " We 're going to put him under Charley Goldman , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , veteran trainer Charley Goldman was a little less enthusiastic . " I ai n't seen the kid yet , of course , but I ai n't excited . Everybody thinks they got a heavyweight champion just because they got a big strong kid . Right now , he 'd get killed by a pro . He do n't know enough about boxing . Of course , Rocky did n't start fighting amateur until he was 25 . I understand Hodge is the same age . Rocky did n't turn pro until he was 28 either . If this kid is as big and strong as they say , you could teach him an awful lot in three years . But like I say , I got to see him first . " // But even Charley Goldman had to admit that a fellow who was fighting for the U.S. Golden Gloves heavyweight championship after a scant 15 fights had definite " possibilities , " and was anything but " ridiculous . " // On the professional front , the first genuinely significant heavyweight fight of the year was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 19 and exposed nationally on Wednesday night television . It was to have decided whether Eddie Machen , the handsome and powerful Californian , or Zora Folley , the handsome and powerful Arizonan , was the clear-cut , undisputed challenger for Floyd Patterson 's politics-ridden heavyweight championship . // It did not necessarily mean that the winner would meet Patterson for the title , since the champion 's manager , Cus D'Amato , has banned Machen from consideration in a dispute centering around whether Machen 's manager did or did not refuse a championship fight last spring , when D'Amato was collecting brickbats for his perennial war with the International Boxing Club ( James D. Norris , president ) . // But a training accident , apparently a pulled muscle , forced Machen to confine himself to roadwork for three days , and after medical examination it was decided to postpone the fight until , very likely , late in April . // This restored the heavyweight situation to what has begun to seem like a normal insolvency . Patterson will next be seen in England , where he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no likelihood that Patterson 's British invasion will result in a defense there this June , as seemed likely before the tarnished British champion , Joe Erskine , lost to the European champion , Ingemar Johansson , who does n't want to fight Patterson until he has spent time in the United States studying how we do it . // D'Amato will look the situation over in England but it will take an outsize magnifying glass to make any British boxer loom big . // June , the month of brides , roses and big fights , looks fine for brides and roses , poor for fights .
