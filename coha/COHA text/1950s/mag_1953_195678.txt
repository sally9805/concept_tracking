Dr. G. John Buddingh of Louisiana State University reported a quicker test for TB . Sputum or spinal fluid from a suspected case is injected into a fertilized egg . Microscopic study within four to six days will show whether tubercle bacilli are present . The current method with cultures or guinea pigs takes four to six weeks . Polio struck early at Prairie Village , Kans. ( pop . 9,500 ) , and , with eight cases reported , the Office of Defense Mobilization allocated 1,000 cc of scarce gamma globulin . Not all exposed children got the shots ; injections were given instead to every third or fourth youngster on lower-grade-school rosters . In all , there was enough G.G. for only 117 shots , but most parents of passed-over childrcn took it gracefully .
