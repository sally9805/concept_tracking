Among the seven passengers on the Philippines Air Lines DC-3 that morning was a young Chinese in a leopard-skin jacket . As the plane took off from north Luzon 's Laoag Ilocos Norte airport , on the coast of the South China Sea , the passengers settled down for the routine half-hour flight to Aparri . Suddenly the plane lurched into a 45 bank . Purser Eduardo Diago came down the aisle reassuring passengers : " That was a terrific downdraft . " He tried the handle of the pilot 's cabin , tried again , and began hammering on the door . Then the passengers saw him slump to the floor , blood spurting from his left eye . There were two bullet holes in the cabin door . Only then did the passengers notice that the young Chinese in the leopard-skin jacket was not with them . <P> The Lurch that Failed . On the plane manifest he was listed as Lucio Lee , but his real name was Ang Tiv-chok ; he had left Amoy , in South China , in 1947 , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The DC-3 had just taken off when Ang quietly slipped into the pilots ' cabin . The two pilots , thinking that a passenger had come in for a view of the cockpit , glanced behind them - and looked straight into the barrel of Ang 's .45 Colt . Ang thrust a typewritten note at them : " Do not be alarmed . I am a desperate man . This is a stickup . Do not talk to each other . " He ordered them to set a course for Amoy , some 500 miles away . Pilot Captain Pedro Perlas protested that the plane did not have enough fuel . Suddenly he threw the wheel over to the left , hoping that the 45 lurch would knock Ang off his feet . Instead , Ang kept his balance , fired two bullets into Captain Perlas . It was just a moment later that Purser Diago began hammering on the door . Swinging round , Ang fired through the door , and it was then that the passengers first knew something was up . Captain Perlas made a feeble effort to unfasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , killing him . <P> The Finger on the Trigger . The rest of the story is Copilot Felix Gaston 's : " I thought to myself : I am a dead duck , a goner . Dear Lord , ca n't I even see my unborn child ? I tried everything . I said I had eaten no breakfast and was dizzy . I pretended illness and asked for water and food . But he would n't open that door . I offered to intercede with Defense Secretary Ramon Magsaysay for him . I said the left engine was stalling and that we had to ditch the plane . I put on a life jacket , gave him one , and pretended to panic . He said O.K. , look for land . <P> " I weighed the chances of rushing him , and I managed to unfasten my seat belt and remove the arm rest . But he kept watching every move I made . I tried to find out what he knew about planes and direction . We were at an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying at 120 m.p.h . He asked , why so slow , and pushed at the throttles . I told him to be more economical on the gas . I kicked the rudder and started into a turn , but he noticed . He was wearing a wrist compass . He said that if I went back to the Philippines he would kill me . He held that gun cocked every minute , with his finger on the trigger . "
