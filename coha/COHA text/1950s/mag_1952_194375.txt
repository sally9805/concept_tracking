Actors traditionally have trouble with prejudiced landlords , but the members of Blevins Davis ' Porgy and Bess company are more sensitive than most to such snubs : all but three of the 65 in the cast are Negroes . From the American cast 's point of view , one of the best things about Porgy 's current triumphant tour of Europe has been the relative absence of discrimination . Then last month the Porgy company arrived in London , and became a prompt smash hit ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) . <P> Sure of a long stay , the actors began looking for permanent places to live . Irving Barnes , chief understudy , went to inspect a flat . " Sorry , " said the landlady , " I wo n't rent to a Negro . You people do n't know how to take care of other people 's property . " Joe Crawford tried to find a flat by telephone . The agent asked his nationality . " I said American , " said Crawford , " and the agent told me to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the landlady took one look and said it was rented . " <P> The cast learned that many London leases have automatic prohibitions against Indians and Negroes . It hurts more in London , says Barnes : " In New York , or Pittsburgh , or Atlanta , you see signs that say ' Whites Only ' and you expect it . I 've met Britishers back home who saw such things and said they thought it was horrible . Then , when you come over here and meet the same thing face to face again , it gets pretty discouraging .
