From a makeshift command post in the Manitoba legislature building last week , a composed , greying soldier in the red-tabbed battledress of a brigadier defended besieged Winnipeg against the city 's worst flood in a century . His orders flowed by field telephone and radio to 50,000 men sweating on 15 miles of soggy , sandbagged dikes along the surging Red River of the North . Occasionally he hopped into a helicopter for a hurried look at a new danger point . By week 's end , as hope mounted that the main crisis had been met with only two lives lost , many a Winnipegger sent up a waterlogged cheer for Brigadier Ronald Morton , 49 , veteran of D-day in Normandy . <P> Dogged Battle . As boss of " Operation Red Ramp " ( for Red rampage ) , with nearly 5,000 army , navy and air force men under his command , Morton 's job was to prevent complete inundation of Canada 's fourth largest city ( pop . 320,000 ) . At least 10,000 houses and eight of greater Winnipeg 's 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's key bridges was cut off , dividing the area into semi-isolated segments . The water level stood twelve feet above the point of first flooding . The city 's vital power stations were entrenched behind dikes more than six feet high . <P> Morton and his men were fighting a dogged , seldom dramatic battle of containment , with wet snow and rain adding to their difficulties . At suburban East Kildonan a 25-foot dike section burst , swamping 150 homes in a boiling wall of water ten feet high . But in most places the dikes-made of sodden burlap sandbags-were holding . <P> Outward Bound . During the week , Morton directed the greatest mass evacuation in Canadian history . In eight days alone , an estimated 80,000 people left the Winnipeg area in special trains , aircraft , buses and a fleet of cars and trucks . Some went to boarded-up resorts to the north , others to points as far away as Calgary and Montreal . The Red Cross provided emergency funds for the needy . Thousands of other evacuees crowded into downtown Winnipeg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into a dormitory . If the situation worsened drastically , Morton had a master plan for compulsory evacuation , under martial law , of as much as 75% of the city 's 320,000 population . Food was stockpiled ; emergency passes and ration cards were printed . <P> By this week the river level appeared to be stabilizing although the danger was still grave . As relief operations gathered momentum , Winnipeggers had an urgent question : how could future floods be prevented ? Flood experts had a grim reply : they probably can not . The cost of permanent diking would be prohibitive , and in any case it might be an engineering impossibility in the flat Red River valley . Once in 25 , 50 or 100 years , the valley would probably have to take it .
