Dressed in black from head to foot , frail , tiny ( 4 ft. 7 in . ) Felicitas Amorin de Fritscher looked older than her 39 years . As she dusted the carved cedar choir stalls of Lima 's 300-year-old cathedral , her son Federico , 11 , worked beside her . " I came to live here 17 years ago , " she said as she finished cleaning the white-enameled spittoon beside the archbishop 's throne . " I was the bride of Federico Fritscher , bell-ringer and caretaker of the cathedral . The pay was small but there were tips from the tourists , and here we paid no rental . With our seven children we were poor but happy . " <P> In the still vastness of the old church she shuffled slowly down a shadowy side aisle to the ornate tomb of Francisco Piz-zarro . Within a glass-walled casket lay the old conqueror 's mummy with bones showing here &; there through the dark yellow skin . " This was our gold mine for tips . Pizzarro is like one of my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his chapel clean . I also kept all the keys , including the keys to the underground vaults where archbishops and bishops lie buried . And of course I helped to ring the bells . <P> " Those bells were my joy and sadness . When it was a repique a joyous peal of bells for processions and fiestas I felt like running down the stairs to join the crowd in the square and be happy with them . But when I went up with my husband to toll the big one for someone 's death , I always wondered who had died and thought of the life to come . And then-think of it ; -I had to toll the big bell for my own husband . " <P> Her husband had died four months ago . Afterwards Felicitas , pregnant with her eighth child , went to Dean Jeronimo Carranza to ask for her husband 's job . " It is against tradition , " said the dean . When Felicitas appealed , the cardinal himself upheld the dean . <P> Even after a new man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her three small rooms behind the cathedral . Finally the dean took steps to evict her . " This is no job for a woman , " he said . " Of her six girls , two are practically young women now . The sensible thing is to force her to leave . " Said a young Lima matron : " The dean is right . Her daughters are pretty and that is likely to make people talk . " At week 's end , after receiving a cash indemnity , the lady bellringer was turned out of her rooms . Said Felicitas : " It is el destino . And when that is against you , you can cry yourself blind . It is not easy for a pregnant woman to find a job . I only hope it is not a girl this time . Day and night I pray the Lord to give me a second boy . "
