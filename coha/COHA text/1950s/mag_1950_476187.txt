VERY candid mind must admit that the villains of a nation are as certainly a part of the true picture of it as are FJ its heroes . Cato without Nero is not an accurate representation of Rome ; Fondle was as much a Frenchman as Bayard ; and if Alfred the Great was an English king , so also was John . Even in our own early ? history we recognize the existence of the deplorable , if only to point up the virtues of the worshipful . Sir William Berkeley who , according to Charles II , " killed more people in that naked country ryirginia than I did for the murder of my father " ; Judge Samuel Sewall , who hanged nineteen Salem witches ; and Benedict Arnold are all authentic figures in the pageant of American history and were they omitted the story would be falsified . It follows that a survey of the record beginning with the year that saw the foundation of Harper 's Magazine and coming down to the present would be incomplete without some reference to the incidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be encompassed in a single issue of the magazine can not waste attention upon scurvy knaves such as can be dealt with adequately by the uniformed police ; but on the other hand it can not ignore villains in the grand manner , malefactors who operated potently and with an air for these really af-fected the course of cventTas ordinary thieves , ' swindlers , and fanciers of homicide never did . Such figures must be very conspicuous indeed , and it would seem that pointing them out should be the simplest of tasks ; but an element enters that complicates the apparent simplicity of the operation . It is the influence of geography . The period under consideration begins in 1850 , and by 1850 the United States was a continental domain . Texas , California , and Oregon had all been acquired and the writ of the Supreme Court ran from the Lake of the Woods southeastward to Key West and southwestward to San Diego , that is to say , from the sub-arctic to the sub-tropic in mundane geography , and in the spiritual realm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of common knowledge that villainy , like oranges and barley , is greatly affected by climatic conditions , and if the area under consideration is one with a wide climatic range , it is difficult to find a villain who is equally villainous in all parts of that area . Which of the great rogues of European history appeared equally scoundrelly in every corner of Europe ? Madrid 's loathsome pirate , Drake , was Sir Francis , the ornament of Elizabeth 's court , in London . Peter of Russia , indistinguishable from Shaitan in Constantinople , was an interesting and industrious ship carpenter in Holland . In England prior to 1815 Napoleon was a villain , net , but only there ; everywhere else he oscillated with bewildering speed between ogre and hero . Since 1850 the United States in both geography and demography has resembled Europe more closely than it has resembled any single European country ; hence our estimation of villains is European , rather than English , or French , or German , which is another way of saying that it is somewhat wavering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when I , born and bred in North Carolina , compared notes in Baltimore with another newspaper scrivener born and bred in Chicago . He remarked that when he first crossed Mount Vernon Place , the Siegesallee of the Maryland city , and on the pedestal of a statue there read the name , " Roger B. Taney , - he all but fainted . He would as soon have expected to see a statue of Benedict Arnold . I had just returned from my first visit to Boston , and I understood his emotion ; for on Boston Common I had seen a bronze figure representing Charles Sumner , and in a respectable city I should as soon have expected to find a statue of Beelzebub . It is evident , then , that even as the barley which flourishes in the country around Chicago and much farther north is hardly worth cultivating in the heat of Alabama , so the villainy of the Chief Justice who delivered the Dred Scott decision , strong in Illinois , droops and fails below the Mason and Dixon Line ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only under artificial conditions , as the oranges that thrive prodigiously in Florida can be grown only under glass in Boston . 1'ITME is another variable that complicates the calculus of villainy in a specimen of any real size . Within my own lifetime , for example , I have seen Woodrow Wilson transmogrified from a demigod into a demon and back . into a demigod again , and that within the two decades between 1920 and 1940 . In fact , I have seen faster metamorphoses on a smaller scale ; it was in 1920 that H. L. Mencken published the second volume of his Prejudices , containing the blistering essay , " The Sahara of the Bozart , " that made him everywhere below the thirty-seventh parallel the damnedest villain since William Tecumseh Sherman . But that essay heralded , if it did not touch off , a tremendous burst of intellectual production in Dixie which did the region a lot of good ; so when . Mencken yen ; tired into the South only about six years later his journey : became a sort of Romantriumph , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , and rising to a thunderous climax at New Orleans , where they made him an honorary fire chief and photographed him wearing a large , white fireman 's hat . Mencken is the only literary figure of the past century who has collected denunciations that fill an entire volume ; so if he rates no higher than a part-time , temporary villain , it is plainly futile to search further among men of letters . But not even Mencken changed character as rapidly as the one other type whose lightning-like descent to Avernus is remembered by men still in their thirties . In times past the word " hanker " before a man 's name was not a mere designation ; it was an honorific , easily ranking with the French " de " or the German " von " and approaching in grandeur the English " sir . " But in the month of October , " the lonesome October " 1929 , a " most immemorial year , " the word " banker " became practically overnight an epithet so opprobrious that calling a Frenchman a species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than hurling " banker " at an American . Even today , twenty years later , although the word has lost its opprobrium , it is still no more than a common noun , denuded of all reverential associations ? a classical demonstration of the thinness of the line that separates sanctity from villainy . Triangulation of an American villain of impressive size is thus an intricate and perplexing operation . It requires a base line not only of known altitude , but also of known latitude and known date . It is quite impossible to measure Thaddeus Stevens , for example , unless it is known whether you are viewing him from the angle of 1869 or that of 1949 . The Warren G. Harding of 1921 is obviously not in the same category as the Harding of 1925 . T T FOLLOWS that , disregarding certain per-sons of murderous and larcenous pro- clivities from Jesse James to Al Capone , it is difficult to find conspicuous American figures of whom one can say flatly , as Dr. Sidney Painter says in his recently-published life of King John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1850 and 1950 the two worst Presidents undoubtedly were Grant and Harding . One is safe in saying that they were bad Presidents ; but to say that they were bad men is not merely questionable , it is nonsensical . No doubt Grant had a weakness for bottles and Harding for belles , but villainy , like ambition , " should be made of sterner stuff . " When lame Talleyrand brought Fondle into the audience chamber to be presented to the Bourbon king , Chateaubriand , noting how the Prince leaned heavily on the policeman 's arm , could remark , " I seemed to see Vice advancing , supported by Crime . " No scene in American history since 1850 comes as close to justifying such a remark by an intelligent man , not even when Albert B. Fall went nosing into Woodrow Wilson 's sick-room . Yet , subject to the caveat that American villains are not equally villainous when viewed from different angles , it is possible to arrange the deplorables of the past century in interesting classifications , based first on their intrinsic nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did to the country . In considering their generic qualities one admission may as well be stated at once . We have never yet produced a scoundrel who made a real contribution to the refinement of vice , as the Roman emperor Caligula is supposed to have been an ingenious contriver of new perversions , or as the Borgias are said to have developed the art of poisoning , or as Adolf Hitler contrived the new crime of genocide . There is extant a writing attributed to Benjamin Franklin which the prudish have construed as a defense of gerontophilia , but it is in fact no more than a discourse on social manners and customs with some observations on expedience in conforming to them . The American villain is , in comparison with classical and even modern European and re Asiatic models , somewhat pallid . Lust plays a relatively unimportant part in his make-up , and sloth hardly any . Pride is usually confined to the narrow limits of personal vanity and gluttony is negligible . Of the seven deadly sins covetousness , anger , and envy are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anger , vindictiveness . II H . -% R PER 'S MAGAZINE was barely two years old before three who may be called the last of the truly statuesque American historical figures died . These were John C. Calhoun , Daniel Webster , and Henry Clay . We have had greater men since , but even Abraham Lincoln was not as monumental during his lifetime as these were , and as John Adams and the Virginia Dynasty were before them . It follows that whatever they did was colossal and , if bad , was worse that latter-day statesmen could than anything perpetrate . For instance , Webster 's Seventh of March speech was regarded in New England as a betrayal of such proportions that Whittier spoke of A bright soul driven Fiend-goaded , down the endless dark , From hope and heaven ! an anguished shriek that could hardly be extorted from a New England poet today were the Honorable Harry S Truman caught down on his knees shooting craps with Joseph Stalin . Clay 's deal with John Quincy Adams to keep Andrew Jackson out of the Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As viewed from the appropriate angle , these were villainies in the grand manner . True , below the Potomac the Seventh of March speech made Webster a hero of tremendous dimensions ; and in the perspective of a hundred years it is apparent that its support of the Compromise of 1850 postponed the Civil War and perhaps thereby saved the Union , since time was working against the South . Clay 's deal made him a hero in New England and gave the country a nearly ; great President in the younger Adams . Nullification made Calhoun immortal in the South and , curiously , has made him something of a national hero since 1932 among those intellectuals who are desperate for effective arguments against the welfare state . The Civil War that burst when Harper 's Magazine was ten years old stands out in history as the greatest of our national tragedies , and the violent demagogues on both sides who helped precipitate it were highly undesirable citizens , but they were , a rule , so small that it is difficult for the as historian to descry them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to achieve lasting fame in the same way that Horst Wessel did , to wit , by getting himself hanged for good and sufficient reasons ; but Robert Barnwell Rhett , just as vicious if less energetic , on the other side , is known only to historians and other students of political microbiology. enn u le , ho actually fought the war were long ago acquitted of anything worse than using bad logic in deciding a problem involving divided loyalties . Indeed , the losing side , which normally furnishes the villains in any great revolt , has given us our nearest approximation to Arthur , the Blameless King , in Robert E. Lee ; and the brilliance of his military record is a source of American pride although the proud American may be from Minnesota instead of Georgia . Even the momentary victims of war-born fury are now recognized as victims ; fair-minded Northerners are ashamed that leg-irons were fastened upon Jefferson Davis , as fair-minded Southerners are ashamed of what their sharp-tongued grandmothers said about Sherman . HE quarter-century following the Civil War is generally accounted bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it the title , The Tragic Era . It was during this period that we elected Grant to the Presidency and almost elected James G. Blaine . It was the time of the Credit Mobilier and the railroad buccaneers , the incubation period of the great trusts . It was the time when the natural resources of the country were expropriated with an effrontery unequaled before or since . It was the time when the corruption of the cities of the Eastern seaboard reached its nadir , and when the legitimate aspirations of the working classes were crushed with a brutal ferocity unparalleled in our history . It would seem logical , therefore , to look to this period for examples of towering villainy , if they are to be found at all . Villains there were , in plenty , and if theft be accounted the acme of villainy some of them were towering . The cities , the states , and the nation were robbed with brazen recklessness ; small business men were stripped of a1 they had and tossed into the almshouse , and the robbers called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed of its elementary rights and the robbers had the ineffable gall to name the robbing Christian piety , as when Rockefeller said God gave him the money lie extracted from his competitors . Some of them bought judges and prosecuting attorneys . Some of them bought Congressmen on the hoof , as the pork-packers bought swine in Chicago , checking them not by name but by the number purchased . In the cities , bosses like Tweed , of New York , regimented the ignorant and the poor , and by means of their votes put into municipal offices creatures who looted the public treasury of multiplied millions . At the same time they revived the ancient evil of the sale of indulgences , but this time on the mundane level ; they sold immunity from prosecution to gamblers , prostitutes , dive-keepers , and gangsters , and also to " respectable " business men who wished to evade the law for profit . Iii the single department of thievery this was truly prodigious , but as part of the wide realm of sin it may be called rather narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by comparison with the Praetorian Guard 's putting the whole Roman Empire up at auction , or the course of Warwick in delivering all England to one side or the other as suited his personal advantage . The mightiest of the " malefactors of great wealth " in the Tragic Era could not sell the United States bodily . Nor could they , as the event proved , do it irreparable damage . This is not to be written down to their credit , for they did their worst . But while the outcome of their operations does not affect their moral quality , it does have a very definite effect on their stature as villains . The man who steals milk bottles may be as wicked as the man who steals a bank , but he is not as important . Oakes Ames , for example , may have stolen $20 , - 000,000 in the Credit Mobilier scheme between 1867 and 1872 ; in the abstract this looks enormous , but in the concrete situation it shrinks in importance , because his scheme did get the Union Pacific Railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vastly important that the loss of 520,000 , - 000 in its construction counts hardly more than the pilfering of milk bottles counts in the dairy business . Hence , even if al that is said against him is true , Ames is an object of contempt , rather than of terror , not to be compared , for instance , to John Law , whose Mississippi Bubble all but wrecked France in the eighteenth century , or even to Serge Alexandre Stavisky , whose pawnshop swindle almost wrecked it again in the twentieth . THIS curious immunity to the attacks of thieves is strikingly exemplified in the history of the cities for the past century . There is hardly one that has not been pillaged by crooked politicians at some time since /850 ; and there is hardly one in which the work of the pillagers has not turned out to be in some way profitable to the town . For blatant and shameless criminality it is hard to beat the record of the Tweed ring in New York between 1850 and 1875 . Their effect on public morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not . Tweed got a $40,000 bribe in stock of the corporation for getting the Brooklyn Bridge project approved , and a very much larger rake-off in connection with the purchase of the real estate that now comprises Central Park- In twenty-five years the Tweed ring certainly stole $30,000,000 and some observers have estimated the loot at seven times that much ; but today the value of the park property alone is more than all the gang stole , to say nothing of the bridge and a dozen other public improvements that the Tweed ring put through . For emphasis let it be repeated ? this is no credit to Tweed ; but it does have the effect of reducing him from the status of a disaster to the status of a petty annoyance to the city of New York . It is possible to argue with sonic plausibility that such characters as Oakes Ames , Tweed , and the industrial and financial buccaneers were necessary to the country and worth more than they cost ? more , at least , than their cost in money . In the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly evident that the gentry who were anxious to line their own pockets speeded up completion of the roads anywhere from ten to twenty years . Theoretically , the roads might have been built by honest men ; but practically the honest men who originated the enterprises failed to carry them through . Crooks who saw the possibility of vast profits for themselves supplied the driving energy requisite for the last great effort . Similarly , in the cities the large public improvements should have been made by honest men ; but the history of such improvements shows that honest men almost invariably opposed their making . Our social consciousness was not sufficiently developed for us to realize the civic necessity of parks , playgrounds , boulevards , or even , in many places , adequate water supply and sanitary systems . The crooks did not appreciate that necessity any more than the honest men , but they did see in large public works opportunity for large graft , so they heartily favored the improvement of cities and thereby contributed , however unwittingly , to the health , safety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work proves , on the whole , belie-ficial to the public , there is a certain incongruity in describing him as a villain in the grand manner . Whether one considers the building of the railroads , of the industrial system , or of the cities , it is doubtful that the land pirates were , on balance , an affliction . The real affliction was the inertia , due to lack of imagination , of the honest majority . Had we been socially alert , there would have been no need of crooks ; but we were lethargic , almost comatose . Like strychnine in certain cardiac conditions , the poison that the robber barons injected served as a stimulant whose toxic effects were inconsiderable by comparison with the value of the reaction it produced . III I T IS not to be denied that the United States has suffered lasting hurts in the years since 1850 ; but the injuries that are felt for generations after their infliction are not financial . They are injuries to the mind and the spirit , not to the pocketbook . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comprised the damage that Albert B. Fall inflicted upon the country ; it would have been better to lose ten times as much oil than to lose our former confidence that the President 's Cabinet , while it may sometimes be incompetent , or even silly , is never crooked . Huey Long was perhaps the most dangerous demagogue that the country has produced ; but he was dangerous not because his - gang stole so much in Louisiana , but because he stimulated the latent appetite for fascism in all parts of the country . As an individual , Fall never commanded an impressive following ; at most he was but a bush-league rascal ; but Long came close to being a villain in the grand manner , one comparable to Bloody Mary with a potential capacity to swell to something like the size of Hitler . Where the pint-size rogues stole money , he had the ability to steal reason and judgment from the minds of men , leaving them furnished with nothing but prejudice and emotion , mostly hate . That sort of theft is , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the course of American history ; so the men who have perpetrated it would seem to be the only kind of villains worthy of serious notice by history . But as one surveys the years since 1850 an anomaly becomes apparent . The men who have embezzled our good sense and substituted for it hatred , suspicion , distrust , and cynicism have only in rare instances been villains by any dictionary definition of the word . Far more frequently they have been holy men , and some of them are enshrined near the top of the secular hagiology . Consider , for example , the evils that still survive as legacies of the Civil War . The slaughter and destruction perpetrated by Grant and Lee were repaired and forgotten , long ago . The never-dying evils were the hatreds and prejudices that attended the conflict and these were only to a small extent the work of the soldiers . The men in uniform had little to do with establishing the conviction , on one side , that the institution of slavery was the deliberate choice of wicked men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an economic policy , but one step in an infamous project to obliterate the South as Hitler hoped to obliterate Poland . Yet these convictions were the bases of a cold war that lasted for many years and that has not been entirely eliminated to this day , as witn. , 7 .. ss the frequent recourse to filibustering by the Southern bloc in the United States Senate . The people who poisoned the relations of the sections were not rapscallions but , as a rule , persons animated ? or so they thought ? by the highest motives . Harriet Beecher Stowe , the novelist , and her preacher brother , Henry Ward Beecher , William Lloyd Garrison , the abolitionist , and Charles Sumner , the pious Senator , were persons of the utmost respectability . Beecher 's lamentable entanglement with a choir singer does not invalidate the assertion ; for in the first place , the trial resulted in a hung jury and in the second place , if he did step aside from the path of rectitude with the charming Mrs. Tilton , that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other side the monumental figure , John C. Calhoun , was in his private life perhaps the most impeccably correct man who ever figured prominently in American politics . He was so correct , indeed , that he tangled with Andrew Jackson rather than accept socially Mrs. Peggy Eaton , against whom , after all , nothing was ever proved . That collision destroyed him as a Presidential possibility , and a politician who will sacrifice the Presidency to propriety is proper in a superlative degree . The Southern fire-eaters of smaller caliber , such as Jefferson Davis , Yancey , and Rhett , likewise deserved Mark Antony 's ironical encomium , " So are they all , all honorable men . " Incidentally , it is worthy of passing notice-that the commercial and industrial pirates of the Tragic Era after the Civil War did more lasting damage by debauching politics than by looting the public till . Their wholesale purchase of official and legislative cattle reduced the standard of public service for many years and set up in the minds of the voters a pernicious tolerance of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it was precisely this , the most anti-social act of which they were guilty , that they could most easily justify in their own minds . They bought judges , legislators , and Congressmen lavishly , yes ; but only , as they thought , to prevent their being bought by some villain of a deeper dye . Ilene they could quite consistently regard their purchases as measures of public safety . HONG calamities below the level of high tragedy one of the most unfortunate which the nation suffered between 1850 and 1950 was the fourteen years ' orgy of criminality inaugurated by adoption of the prohibition amendment . Yet the prohibition movement was semi-religious from the start . After it gained some headway it attracted numbers of spectacular hypocrites , as any movement that is plainly succeeding is bound to do ; but in general the prohibitionists were pious , sincere , and rigidly moral . Their aim , like that of the abolitionists , was to do good . ' The next great tragedy after the Civil War was the collapse of the moral hegemony this nation attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Nations was but one incident in the larger tragedy of the defeat of the world 's hope that in democracy it had discovered a method of government really capable of effecting the safety and happiness of the people . Who was responsible is still a matter of dispute , but the thing happened , and once it had happened the one possible avenue of escape from the second world war was definitely closed . This country was not solely responsible for the disaster , but it bears a large share of the responsibility , and as far as our part is concerned there are but two possible explanations . One is that the disaster was attributable to the intransigence of Woodrow Wilson ; the other is that it flowered from the conspiracy of Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge , Sr. , who planned , before Wilson had reached Paris , to defeat any treaty that he might bring back . Take your choice ; but no matter which alternative you prefer , or even if you embrace both , you are confronted by the fact that the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was struck , not by any villain , but by gentlemen of the highest character , whose purpose was to do good . This leaves the arrant rogues looking somewhat ineffective , which calls for explanation . The most plausible theory is based on the assumption that scoundrelisrn is a product of social decomposition , as methane is of physical rot . To produce marsh gas naturally in any considerable quantity you must have a cesspool of large dimensions ; similarly , to produce a really gigantic villain you need a moral cesspool of formidable extent , and we have had none . Our stink-holes have all been relatively small . Tweed , for example , was the product of frightful social and economic conditions among the poor of New York City ? conditions repeated on a smaller scale in smaller cities and productive of smaller Tweeds . But the slums at that time were urban and the country was predominantly rural , so not even Tweed became a national menace . We have not yet had nation-wide conditions bad enough to produce a Robespierre , a Hitler , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type , came from a state admittedly among the most backward in the Union as far as social services to the people are concerned : and he flourished at a time when the whole country was suffering under an economic collapse that bore hardest upon the poor . But we managed to pull out of the Depression before he , or any of his type , could become highly dangerous . So far , we have always managed to clean up the rotten spots before they had poisoned the whole body politic sufficiently to produce a rogue who would stand among the giants of his breed . IV ILLAINY , however , is determined largely by whether you are on the sending or receiving end . What does me serious and lasting injury I can not regard as just and right , irrespective of motives . If our worst national disasters are attributable to the pious and respectable ? not a uniquely American experience , for Robespierre was justly called " The Incorruptible " ? it is plainly relevant to the discussion to examine the calamitous sanctified , to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some common factor other than the pure desire to do good . There must be some one element present in characters apparently as completely diverse as Calhoun , Sumner , Garrison , Bryan , and Borah . One conies to mind immediately ? they all distrusted the processes of democracy . This charge brought against Bryan , of all people , will evoke indignant and astonished denials , but the charge stands . The Commoner did , indeed , trust the people in all matters strictly political , but he had no faith whatever in their capacity in the moral realm . There he believed in the doctrine of the Elect to whom the truth was delivered and whose duty it is to make it prevail , regardless of the opinions of the unregenerate . Darwinians and winebibbers he regarded not as merely mistaken , but as a stiff-necked and froward generation , to be corrected by the rod . So it was with the others . Each was so certain of the righteousness of his own judgment that he attributed moral turpitude to any contrary judgment . However much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not himself at least his sect , his faction , his cause as the sole repository of truth . He had never heeded the advice of Cromwell to the Scotch Presbyterians : " I beseech you , brethren , that you pray God to show you that it is possible for you to be mistaken . " It is as certain as anything can be that the man of fixed moral principles is the very bedrock on which civilization rests . But there is a difference , sometimes hard to see yet immensely important , between believing that one 's own principles are right and drawing the inference that the principles of all others are wrong and should be extirpated . It is precisely this difference that furnishes the moral basis for majority rule ; the genuine democrat concedes not only that the other fellow has a right to his opinion , but that he actually does right in maintaining that opinion by every argument that he can bring to its support . To put down opinion by employing terror , whether it be fear of the hangman or fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw aside from true Americanism and to adhere in some measure to some form of the heresy of the Herrenvolk . Twenty centuries ago Marcus Aurelius was very emphatic on this point . " He is an abscess on the universe , " said the imperial philosopher , " who withdraws and separates himself from the reason of our common nature through being displeased with the things which happen ; .. - he is a piece rent asunder from the state who tears his own soul from that of reasonable animals . " Marcus Aurelius , however , was an emperor . He made the law , and what he said went . Smaller , men must be more prudent . Certainly an abscess on the universe is a villainous thing , but an assertion that to be false to the inner spirit of democracy is , in a leader , the greatest villainy that can be perpetrated on his people , is a stiffer commination than it is becoming for us to utter . It drags one into metaphysical speculations regarding m otives and guilt or innocence before God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on the record than the obvious truth that the lesson of the century since 1850 is something of a paradox ; for it plainly implies that within the period the damned rascals have done us little harm , but the holy terrors have very nearly been our ruin .
