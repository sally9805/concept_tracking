MOST experts agree that all-out atomic war might end civilization . But what about the long-range effects of atomic-age peace ? Last year the National Academy of Sciences , financed by the Rockefeller Foundation , undertook to find out . Last week its committees of eminent scientists made their report on what increasing radioactivity can do to humanity . General conclusions : 1 ) something new , strange and dangerous has come into the world ; 2 ) not enough is known about it ; 3 ) careful precautions should be taken to ward off future disaster . <P> <P> The committees were not much worried about nuclear-weapons tests . " High-yield " thermonuclear explosions toss radioactive material into the stratosphere , where it hangs for years drifting around the earth . The tests also raise the radio active level of large areas of ocean . But these effects are slight , and will do no appreciable harm unless the tempo of bomb testing is increased many times over . There is nothing , say the scientists , to the popular idea that bomb testing has upset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful news in the report . All the committees were worried about the swift growth of the atomic age . Each year more radioisotopes are shipped to laboratories and hospitals ; more nuclear reactors go into operation ; more " hot " residues are processed and disposed of somehow . Within a few years , the scientists point out , large nuclear power plants will be built in many parts of the world . Many ships will be atomic , many industries will use radioactive equipment . Therefore , many more people will come into contact with radiation . <P> <P> Ocean &; Air . The Committee on Oceanography warned that radioactive wastes foreseeable in the near future will be too potent to discharge into the ocean 's surface water , from which they might be carried ashore or enter human bodies in seafood . If the wastes are dumped at sea , they must be carefully sunk in deep spots where bottom water has little circulation . A research program should be started at once , say the scientists , to find the best such places . <P> The Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off radioactive gases , some of which are difficult to control or get rid of . In the year 2000 , the committee figured , the world 's atomic power plants will be producing enough krypton 85 to raise appreciably the radioactivity of the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere . Other gases given off at fuel-processing plants , e.g. , iodine 131 , can do even worse on a local scale . The committee points out that unfavorable weather conditions around a processing plant can concentrate the gases intensely . <P> Large atomic power plants will contain so much radioactive material that a blow-up would be a major disaster , causing serious damage over thousands of square miles . By 2000 , figured the committee , the earth 's reactors will contain so much strontium 90 ( a cancer-causing radioisotope which deposits in the bones ) that the dispersal of 1% of it would seriously contaminate the entire earth .
