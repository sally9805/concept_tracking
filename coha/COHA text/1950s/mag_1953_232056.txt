Charity creates a multitude of sins . <P> - Oscar Wilde <P> American travelers are often shocked at the ragged beggars who gather around the cathedrals of Europe , the mosques and holy places of the Orient . The sight of a paretic Venetian pandering his nine-year-old daughter , or of a Calcutta mendicant clutching the withered body of a dead baby with one hand , a beggar 's bowl in the other , is not easily forgotten . In such situations , Americans often assume the smug attitude that such things are not done at home ; in the good old U.S.A. , everything is organized , charity is tidily and efficiently handled . <P> Last week , from the doings in a Manhattan courtroom , Americans learned that the nation is nursing something far worse than the professional beggars of Europe and Asia . Millions of dollars are being siphoned away from charitable donations annually by professional promoters and racketeers . Even some of the worthiest causes pay fund-raisers up to 85% out of every donated dollar . <P> In Manhattan 's County Courthouse in Foley Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tompkins and Assemblyman Samuel Rabin listened in stunned silence as a parade of witnesses , many of them very reluctant , unfolded a sordid tale of profit in the name of charity . Items : <P> The National Kids Day Foundation , Inc. , a West Coast organization headed by Hollywood Gossipist Jimmy Fidler , collected $3,978,000 in five years , disbursed a total of $302,000 for charitable purposes . The rest-82% of the take-went into the pockets of professional fundraisers ( Fidler receives no salary ) . Whimpered Fidler : " It seems like they 're picking on us for publicity . " <P> Slick Chicago promoters started a " snowball " campaign by mailing 2,000 crisp dollar bills to " sucker lists " ( with an appeal to match the dollar , or better ) , eventually got back a clear $630,000 for a nonexistent " National Cancer Hospital . " The cost of fundraising : $435,000 . Another Chicago outfit raised $2,531,000 for the relief of war widows and orphans aided by Gold Star Wives of America , Inc . After fund-raising expenses were deducted , the widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn ) Council of the Marine Corps League collected $67,244 for veterans ' welfare . The net take : $4,000 . The rest went into the bank accounts , one hidden , of the promoters . <P> The Disabled American Veterans collected $21,480,000 over a period of three years with a series of splashy contests and a campaign to flood the mails with unsolicited trinkets . Out of this sum , the expenses of the fund-raisers amounted to $14,529,000 , " administrative costs " ate up another $2,400,000 , and $3,837,000 more went for D.A.V. lobbying . Not a cent went for the direct aid of a needy veteran . The D.A.V. does maintain 1,800 local chapters , which help veterans , for example , with their claims against the Government . <P> An unestimated mountain of " clothing for Korea " was sold on the secondhand market and the profits pocketed by the pitchmen.
