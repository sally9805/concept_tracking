The concern is the first of five manufacturers to be " double-checked " in the Government 's plant-by-plant reappraisal of production and testing processes . More than half of the fourteen states having supplies of ParkeDavis vaccine were reported ready to go ahead with the free ' inoculation of first and second-1 grade children , halted a week ago pending the reappraisal . About 1,000,000 cubic centimeters of the company 's cleared product  --  enough for the same ' number of anti-polio shots  --  were on hand and available for im // mediate use in the fourteen states and Alaska .

Supplies of the cleared vaccine also are available in Iowa , Michigan , New Mexico , Oregon , Vermont and Wyoming . Officials in several of those states are awaiting further developments . Information was not available here on the others ' plans . The recheck of Parke-Davis processes by a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centimeters produced by the company . But about two-thirds already had been used in the school program , leaving an estimated 1,000,000 cubic centiMeters of unused vaccine on hand in the states and 817,500 at the Detroit plant . In addition , one lot of 335,000 cubic centimeters was held up for additional information .

The reviews are made by the Federal Laboratory of Biological Control , National Institutes of Health , at Bethesda , Md . Plant Check Pressed ' The Public Health Service was striving to complete the plant-1 by-plant inspections by the , end of next week . Clearance of the other four companies on the list by then would permit renewal of the mass inoculation program on a nearly full-scale basis after a two-week slowdown .
