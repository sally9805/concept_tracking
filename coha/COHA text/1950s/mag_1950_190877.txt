Although the U.S. has poured some $2 billion into the Philippines since 1945 , the new republic is on the verge of bankruptcy . In Washington last February , the Philippines ' President Elpidio Quirino had talked over his troubles with President Truman , asked for a U.S. Economic Mission . Truman sent to Manila able Daniel W. Bell , former Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and now president of the American Security &; Trust Co . <P> Sweeping Charges . A month ago Bell made his report to the President . Rumors that it contained sweeping charges of corruption and mismanagement against the Quirino administration soon leaked to Manila . Last week the press office of the Malacanan Palace , President Quirino 's White House , issued a mimeographed statement . It suggested that the Bell report be made public , " to end unbridled speculation . " The statement then went on to an angry attack upon the U.S. It said : <P> " Philippine ' bankruptcy and corruption ' have an intimate relation to the American example in racketeering and to the insidious inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American standard of living . . . but the Filipinos are mere pikers compared to their more accomplished and eminently successful mentors , who have had and still have a vast continent in which to base their operations . .. Filipinos . . . are inefficient all right-even in their grafting . . . With more time and greater chances they will yet show they can equal or even surpass the stink familiar and now taken for granted in Washington . . . " <P> Reporters traced the statement to Federico Mangahas , President Quirino 's private secretary and ghostwriter . Next day Quirino disavowed authorship , but Manila believed that in a hopping-mad moment he had read and approved the statement . <P> " Strictly Conditioned . " President Truman promptly released the Bell report . Its recommendations : 1 ) increased taxation on high incomes and reform in the tax collector 's office ; 2 ) cutting up big estates for homesteaders , and production credits for small farmers ; 3 ) encouragement for new industries ; 4 ) two-year emergency tax of 25% on imports ; 5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries , to reduce the temptation of graft ; 7 ) U.S. to grant a $250 million loan , " strictly conditioned . " <P> Said Bell : " There are officials in the Philippine government who are aware of the dangers of the pervading economic unbalance between production and needs . . . but the measures that could halt the deterioration have not been put into effect . Inefficiency and even corruption in the government service are widespread . Leaders in agriculture and in business have not been sufficiently aware of their responsibility to improve the economic position of the lower-income groups . The public lacks confidence in the capacity of the government to act firmly . . . The situation is being exploited by the Communist-led Hukbalahap movement to incite lawlessness and disorder . " <P> At week 's end some Philippine newspapers were serializing the 53,000-word Bell report like a sensational mystery story . To give the story point , Washington made an offer of a $250 million five-year loan to the Philippines on condition that Manila carry out the reforms recommended in the Bell report .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
