txt charge of " fiscal irresponsibility " by moving toward a balanced budget . Making up the tax loss occasioned through the $20 cut by extending or expanding tax levies on business and higher-income groups , the plan also allows the Democrats to get in a political whack where they believe it will do the most good . Here is the compromise " tax package " : 1 . It would give a $20 income-tax reduction for each low-bracket taxpayer , plus $10 for each dependent except a taxpayer 's spouse . Couples who claimed split-income benefits ( mostly above the $5,000 income level ) would not receive the new tax credit . 2 . Corporation income - tax rates and certain excises would be extended to July 1 , 1957 , in lieu of the simple one-year extension which the administration has asked . 3 . The dividend tax relief granted stockholders in the 1954 bill would be repealed , providing net savings to the Treasury of 181 million dollars in fiscal 1956 and 362 million dollars In 1957. 4 . The so-called " rapid depreciation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repealed , at an estimated net savings to the treasury of 175 million dollars in fiscal 1956 and 900 million dollars in 1957 . Also , an administration error in the 1954 bill which permits the establishment of reserves for future business expenses and their charge-off against current income would be repealed . This is no new proposal , since Sec : - retary of the Treasury George M. Humphrey also had recommended correction of this mistake . Senate Majority Leader Johnson , hurrying back to take command of the tax battle from a convalescence , outlined the proposals to reporters March 9 as the six members of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee stood by nodding agreement . Total effect of the package deal on the budget would be , Senator Johnson estimated , an increase in revenue amounting to just about 3 million dollars for fiscal 1956 and 354 million dollars for fiscal 1957 .

It was estimated that the original Democratic tax plan  --  calling for a $20 income-tax reduction for low-income taxpayers plus $20 for each of their dependents  --  would have cost the treasury two billion dollars a year . Senator Johnson estimated that the revised income-tax credit would cost 908 million dollars in a full year . He estimated the proposed 18-month extension of corporate and excise taxes would produce $3 , - 537,000,000 over and above a simple one-year extension . Reason for Shift The bill extending the corporate and excise taxes to April 1 , 1956 , moved to the Senate floor March 10 . Until this new package proposal , chances had appeared dim for the " rider " which embodied the original tax cut . Now the Democratic high command has come to the rescue of Mr. Rayburn , and Senator Johnson is fighting by his side .
