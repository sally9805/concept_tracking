txt Vice President Richard M. Nixon said today the United States " made a mistake in 1946 " when it advised Japan to do without an army and navy . " We misjudged the intentions of the Soviet leaders , " Mr. Nixon declared in a major policy speech made here before the JapanAmerica Society . " We believe in peace ; we , believe in disarmament , " he said . " We felt disarmament was proper in 1946 . Why is it wrong then in 1953 ? " It is the threat from the Communist nations and the threat centered in Moscow . " If it were not for the Communist threat , " Mr. Nixon went on , the free world could live in peace . " The Vice President spoke before more than 700 of Japan 's highest leaders  --  members of the Government , diplomats , financial magnates and the rulers of Japan 's great industries . Mr. Nixon 's speech , delivered from notes , ranged over almost , all the major issues confronting Japan today  --  rearmament , Japan 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , trade , tariff policy and troubled relations with Korea . As Mr. Nixon rose to speak he got an ovation . " The people of the United States and the Government of the United States want absolutely nothing except to live in peace , " he said . He called on his audience to " analyze " the world 's only threat to peace , and pointed to the shoot-I ing that has just stopped in Korea , and is still going on in Indo-China . " If we want peace we must bel militarily stronger than the Coin , munist nations , " he said . He advised Japan not to worry about recent American budget cuts in military spending . " By the end of 1955 , we will have more planes ready for combat than , if the plans of the previous , Administration had remained in force , " he promised . He explained the cuts by saying the Communists had boasted " they might be able to destroy us from ! within " by forcing the free nations into economic collapse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but economic strength as well , " he asserted . " The United States can not . do the job alone . All the free nations of the world must stand together . " It is essential for the United States to have friends . What happens in Asia is just as important as what happens in Europe . " Mr. Nixon described Japan as " a key bastion for the defense of Asia . " " If Japan falls , all of Asia falls , " he continued . " Likewise , if Asia falls , Japan falls , too . " Japan must work with the free nations , maintaining adequate ' strength . " Mr. Nixon 's words were another American push to get Japan going on the path toward rearmament . Japanese leavers , headed by Premier Shigeru Yoshida , have shrunk from this step , fearing the economic burden it will lay upon their reviving nation , and also fearing a revival of discredited militarism . Less Blunt Than Knowland But Mr. Nixon 's words were a softer approach than the recent statements of Senator William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bluntly told the Japanese to rearm . Mr. Nixon said he was surprised at how little anti-American sentiment he found here . " If there is anti-Americanism , ' may I say the man in the street ' and the school children have a very strange way of showing it , " he remarked . He referred to the warm , faceto-face welcome he had received in his " Meet the People " contacts as President Eisenhower 's special envoy . His appearances in Japan on his round the world tour have drawn bigger crowds than in any other country and larger turnouts in Japan than for anyone except the Emperor and the Crown Prince . Mr. Nixon attacked other Japanese problems in short order : qTrade ? " The United States is concerned with finding means of expanding trade between Japan and the other areas of the world , particularly southeast Asia . " 9American tariffs ? " We have , industries in the United States , too ? * ' ' " but " * it is the , policy of this Administration that in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than raised . " 411Japan's6 new safety force ? , " They are in every respect excellent forces ? " but they are not adequate to defend Japan . " 41Korea --  . " We in the United States are looking forward to the day when representatives of Japan and Korea will sit down and work out an agreement * * . This is the result we desire and . to which we are willing to contribute in any way we can . " United States defense forces ? , " for the most part " the America.n , troops in Japan " have conducted , themselves admirably . The proof ' of that fact is that relations be- , tween our countries  --  despite points of irritation  --  are as close as they ' are . " Communist intentions ? " it isl essential if we are to protect the free people of the world and not fall into a trap , that we have deeds and not just words as to what their ( the Communists ' ) intentions are . " He listed satisfactory settlements of the Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of such deeds . gUnited States intentions ? " you can be sure that the leadership of the United States is honestly and completely humble with its new responsibilities . We know we have ' made mistakes in the past . We welcome suggestions from our , friends . " The Vice President last night brushed aside reports that he in- , tended to mediate a growing Japanese-Korean controversy . He told , newsmen he had come to the Far , East with " no diplomatic packages or deals to sell . " At the same time it was learned Mr. Nixon considered the Japanese-Korean impasse over fishing rights and other postwar questions as vitally important . He is collecting full information from both Japanese and Korean officials to report on the matter to President Eisenhower .
