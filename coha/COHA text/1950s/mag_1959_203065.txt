One of the trickiest and most disputed questions in the nebulous world of international law is legal jurisdiction in the air . If a Swiss citizen slips arsenic into his wife 's martini on a British airliner flying from Frankfurt to Paris , which country should prosecute-Great Britain because the plane is British , France because the plane landed there after the crime , Switzerland since Swiss citizens were involved , or Germany in whose airspace the crime was committed ? <P> In the age of jets , the answer is still unclear and the problem increasingly acute . To date , in the absence of international agreement , offenders have been prosecuted by arrangements ( sometimes of questionable legality ) between the individual countries involved , or have gone scot-free because no court could decide on jurisdiction . <P> Last week in Munich , legal experts of 27 nations , gathered by the U.N.-sponsored International Civil Aviation Organization , were writing an authoritative law of the air . Basically , the new code 's most important provision would give priority of jurisdiction to the country in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in whose airspace the crime was committed might claim the right to prosecute . The new law would also give pilots authority equivalent to that of ships ' captains on the high seas . They could seize and hold suspects in the air and , when necessary , deputize passengers and crew members to assist them . <P> Though convention draft must still be accepted by the I.C.A.O. 's general assembly next year , and ratified by each contracting country as a matter of treaty , legal experts who have been working on the problem since 1947 were delighted with the speed they have made so far , compared to the centuries in which maritime law evolved .
