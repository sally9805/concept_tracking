The eyes of Texas-some 35,000 pairs of them-were on sprawling Bergstrom Air Force Base at Austin this week . The biggest crowd in Texas sports-car history turned up for a chance at the gate prizes-a Jaguar , an MG and a Studebaker-and the promised thrills and spills of four races , jointly sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America and General Curtis LeMay 's Strategic Air Command . <P> Cigar-chewing Curt LeMay , a sports-car enthusiast who does his own highway driving in a Cadillac-Allard , was on hand to watch a pet LeMay project . Airport racing , with admissions at $2 a head , swells the treasuries of Air Force Aid societies and local charities , pays for barracks improvements and gives SAC airmen a constructive off-duty hobby-tinkering with engines . Moreover , the Sports Car Club gains the advantage of sporty , twisting courses on the runways , where chance spectators are not so apt to wander out into the turns as they sometimes do in road racing . <P> At the start of the main 200-mile race , the roar of the Bergstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 entries-Allards , Ferraris , Jaguars , etc . The president of the Sports Car Club , Driver Fred Wacker Jr . of Chicago went out early with engine trouble . After the first few laps over the tortuous 4.48-mile course ( including turns of 110 and 135 ) the race settled down to a neck &; neck duel between Chicago Manufacturer Jim Kimberly , 45 , in a Ferrari , and California 's Phill Hill , driving a Jaguar C. The Jag was quicker on the corners , but invariably lost ground on the longest straightaway , a 6,000-ft. runway where Kimberly gunned his slim , low-hung speedster up to 150 m.p.h . <P> The winner , at an average speed of 86.4 m.p.h. : dapper , greying Jim Kimberly ( in red gloves and shoes ) , who had made an entrance into Austin that was spectacular even by Texas standards . Included in the Kimberly entourage : a trailer loaded down with two Ferraris , a machine-shop truck , a station-wagon car complete with bar , and two expert mechanics . The whole outfit was decked out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
