Among the heroic figures in Indo-China 's past , no two are more revered than the fabled Trungs-the beautiful young sisters who raised an army against the Chinese invaders in the middle of the 1st century and , faced with defeat , threw themselves into the Red River rather than surrender . <P> Women since then have had little chance to appear heroic . For centuries , the women of what is now South Viet Nam could not marry without their parents ' consent , no matter what their age , or refuse a husband of their parents ' choosing . They had to live with their in-laws , endure without protest their husbands ' infidelities , could be turned out on the flimsiest charge of " disobedience " or reduced to the status of a servant to a new mistress in the house . But three years ago , when South Viet Nam became independent , the women found a champion . As sister-in-law and official hostess of Bachelor President Ngo Dinh Diem , dainty Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu , 30 , a Christian , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the most determined feminist since the late Emmeline Goulden Pankhurst . <P> The Independent One . The daughter of South Viet Nam 's present Ambassador to the U.S. , Mme. Ngo married at 15 , was soon smack in the middle of her country 's resistance first to the French , and then to the Communists . Thrown into prison in 1946 , she escaped , joined the partisans . Today , in her bustling office in the palace , which because of its busyness she calls Le Moulin ( the mill ) , she handles a bewildering assortment of visitors and letters asking every sort of favor , from help in curbing an abusive husband to advice on a Latin essay . She manages the presidential palaces and mansions , but in spite of her connections ran for the National Assembly as an Independent . " I am very independent , " she explains . " It is n't that I disagree with the majority party , but I might in the future . " <P> Three years ago Mme. Ngo began dipping into ancient files and poring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a declaration of independence for women . She wrote drafts in Vietnamese . French and English , sent them to legal experts all over the world for comment . Meanwhile , evoking the magic name of Trung , she rallied the women to the cause , soon began having sleepless nights and nightmares about the situations her bill did not cover , would furiously scribble notes in the night for the next day 's revision . <P> The Fickle Ones . In the Assembly , the opposition was not large , but it was noisy . Male delegates talked interminably about the value of tradition . Just when Mme. Ngo thought she had won them over in committee , they would wriggle free . " Really , " complained Mme. Ngo , " men change their minds much more easily than women . " But gradually , in an Assembly tightly controlled by her brother-in-law , the opposition melted , and last week the Family Bill became the law of the land .                 @ @ @ @
