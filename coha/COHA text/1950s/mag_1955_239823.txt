One morning last week a stately B-36 flew on a steady course more than 40,000 feet above the Nevada wastelands . Miles ahead and 10,000 feet below , Sabre jets flashed back and forth across its path , laying down a grillwork of drifting smoke lines . Then the jets turned and sped out of danger . Two minutes later the big bomber released a bomb triggered to explode six miles in the air . There was an orange-white flash , then a fireball about a half-mile in diameter , a shock wave that danced to the ground 75 miles away , and a giant smoke ring in the sky . The first test of an air-to-air atomic weapon was a lusty success . <P> Present theory and practice of air tactics do not call for bunching bombers in fleets , since one plane armed with an H-bomb is plenty for any target . But the capability to destroy an air armada , perhaps of airborne troops , with a missile or two might come in handy .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
