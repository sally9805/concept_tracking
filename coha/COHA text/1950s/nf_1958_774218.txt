txt  | 6th July 1941 I SEEM to have read somewhere lately , though I can not recall where , that some publisher or other has brought out an English edition of the Four Piano Pieces constituting Brahms 's op. 119 . It is a pity that we so seldom hear at recitals any of these miniatures of Brahms 's middle and final periods , for all in all they are the most flawless of his instrumental works , their conciseness enabling him to dispense with the padding with which he has occasionally to stuff out his larger structures . I would like to see an English edition in one volume of the five sets of small piano pieces ranging from op. 76 to op. 119 ; for it is in some of these that the composer throws his spear furthest into the future . Why they are so neglected by recitalists I do not know . One reason may be that there are so many women pianists and young pianists about ; and , speaking generally , Brahms at his most mature is not the stuff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . They may like ' him , but few of them understand him ; there is something in the music of the final Brahms , as there is in the poetry of the final Hardy , which opens out horizons to those who have passed middle age that are hidden from the view of those who are so unfortunate as not yet to have reached that dividing line . There is little , of course , in most of these pieces ? nothing at all in some of them ? to attract the pianist whose prime purpose is to make it clear to his audience that he has a technique ; which may be one of his reasons for neglecting them . They call for intellectual qualities which few even of the star ' pianists possess : out of a hundred specimens of this superabundant fauna picked up by a drag net any afternoon in Piccadilly or on Broadway who could dazzle us in a Liszt rhapsody or the more difficult of the Chopin studies , it might be hard to find a single one who could play the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be played .  | But these miniatures have an even deeper interest than the emotional or philosophical . They show Brahms getting really to grips with that problem of unbroken continuity of tissue which too often baffled him in his bigger instrumental works . The creative musical imagination at its best , its most logical , should work as Coleridge described Shakespeare 's imagination working : he goes on creating ' , says Coleridge , and evolving B out of A , and C out of B , and so on , just as a serpent moves , which makes a fulcrum of its own body , and seems for ever twisting and untwisting its own strength ' . That , perhaps , will be the ideal of the instrumental music of the future ; the way to it , indeed , seems at last to be opening out before modern composers in proportion as they discard the last tiresome vestiges of sonata form . This , from being what it was originally , the natural mode of expression of a certain eighteenth century way of thinking in music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual thinking and the free unfolding of the inner vital force of an idea , and is now simply a shop device by which a bad composer may persuade himself and the innocent reader of textbooks that he is a good one . The kind of composition so admirably described by Coleridge is an entirely different thing from the so-called development ' of sonata form , and infinitely more difficult ? so difficult , indeed , that the greatest masters have very rarely achieved it , and then only for a few minutes at a time . An ideal example of it is the C major Capriccio of Brahms 's op. 76 ( No. 8 ) . This plays for some two and a half minutes , which seems to be about as long as the most gifted nineteenth century composer could continue on this principle of the serpent and his own fulcrum . As the student may like to look into the matter further for himself , with a few concrete examples to refer to , I will enlarge upon it next week . II 13th July 1941 I SAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano miniatures of his middle and last period that Brahms threw his spear furthest into the future . Were the history of an art , as some people suppose , a record of continuous progress , the  | instrumental music of the nineteenth century would have gone straight on from the final Beethoven to the conquest of fresh territories . What happened was that instrumental composers , finding it impossible to continue the advance along that line , because , for one thing , their brains were not of the calibre of Beethoven 's , went back to an earlier phase of his genius which he himself had outgrown , and made that a starting-point for safe excursions of their own . For all the effect they had on the instrumental practice of the nineteenth century the masterpieces of Beethoven 's last years might almost as well have never been written . It ought to have been evident to the self-styled classicists ' , at least , that if Beethoven himself could not carry any further his own older type of structure it was hardly likely that they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartets and the piano sonatas of his last period Beethoven was manifestly feeling his way towards a quite new method of musical weaving . We can only smile now at the despairing attempts of the puzzled theorists to analyse some of these movements of his in terms of what they call condensed ' sonata form . The very essence , the very significance of them for us today is that they foreshadow a new principle of the unfolding of all the latent possibilities of a musical idea , the principle , as Coleridge expressed it , of the serpent and his own fulcrum . The traces of sonata form found here and there in the sections to which I am referring are no more than temporary retreats on the great artist 's part ; when even his titanic strength failed him for a moment in his attack on a problem so new as this , he stalled ' , as a modern sportsman would say ? he fell back on a safe routine to get breath for a fresh assault on new lines . The type of weaving which I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonata form even at its finest . Coleridge speaks , in connection with Shakespeare 's peculiar art , of the ceaseless coiling and uncoiling from within the organism that produces B out of A and C out of B. This is an entirely different thing from the virtual compulsion upon a composer , in sonata development ' , to say a particular , forecastable B after he has said a particular A. The first hundred bars or so of the Beethoven No. 5 are a perfect example of this species of musical  | logic : we can not only see just how the thing is done but we can even do it ourselves in many another connection ? so far , of course , as mere externals are concerned ! But a composition like the Capriccio of Brahms 's op. 76 ( No. 8 ) is something wholly different . Here everything that happens to the idea is unforeseen and unforeseeable , a secret possessed only by the composer , and one that is valid only for that particular idea . The texture woven is so beautifully , flawlessly one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase and another . Were we to cut the organism it would bleed . This is the hardest thing of all to achieve in music , which is the reason why so far it has been done so seldom and on so tiny a scale . There are fleeting hints of it in Haydn , and longish stretches of it in the final Beethoven . Then it virtually disappeared until an intuition of it came to Brahms ; and the difficulty of it can not be better demonstrated than by the fact that after the superb C major Capriccio of op. 76 , which dates from 1879 , it practically disappears from his work until we reach the next set of miniatures in 1892-93.  | 18th August 1940 HE ca n't jubilate , ' was Hugo Wolf 's rather peevish complaint about Brahms . Recalling this , I wondered last Wednesday what Wolf would have had to say about the Alto Rhapsody had it been his duty to cover ' the Promenade concert of that evening for the Vienna Salonblatt ' . Having discovered that he had actually written about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him declaring it to be one of Brahms 's best ? astonished not only because very little that Brahms had written up to then ( he died , by the way , in 1897 ) had commended itself to Wolf , but because there is certainly none of the jubilation ' in it the lack of which in Brahms 's music as a whole Wolf found so repellent . He even went so far as to suggest that the Rhapsody was hardly the sort of thing the Vienna Brahmsians expected from their idol , for it came nowhere near the freezing point of imagination and sensibility ' reached in the latest works of this industrious composer ' . Much of Wolf 's fury against Brahms , one suspects now , came not so much from temperamental alienation from a good deal of his music ? though there was something , of course , of this ? as from exasperation with the more stupid of the official Brahmins , from Hanslick downwards . Not only did these people claim too much for Brahms , but sometimes they claimed the wrong things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proclaim that Brahms was the heir of Beethoven ' , the divinely appointed warden of the great classical tradition ' , and so on . The musical world of today sees clearly that Brahms had the minimum of affiliation with Beethoven , either as thinker or as craftsman . Nowhere in any of his works has Brahms the smallest point of contact with the far-reaching developments which the giant mind of Beethoven fought so frantically , if not always quite successfully , to compass during the last few years of his life . And the ultimate verdict of history upon Brahms may possibly be that in spite of the heroic efforts he made from time to time to achieve organic symphonic structure on a large scale  | - efforts sometimes decidedly successful for long stretches , at others too obviously eked out with mere academic makeshift and padding ? he was essentially a miniaturist . It was this quality that made him the incomparable master of the variation . To this quality , again , we owe not only dozens of lovely songs and small-scale piano pieces of his , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the exquisite coda to the first movement of the second symphony , which amply compensates us for so much that is the merest class room mechanics in the symphonic ' manipulation of that movement as a whole . Wolf 's revolt , again , was in large part against the foolish attempts of the temple Brahmins to make of their idol not merely a great composer but a solemn high priest of art . Hanslick , for instance , stressed admiringly his ' austerity ' ? as if austerity ' in itself were a virtue in art , irrespective of what was being said with the corners of the mouth turned so austerely down ! Actually what gives Brahms his strong hold on music lovers today is not the restraint and aloofness for which the sillier of his contemporary German and English partisans commended him but the grateful warmth and approachability of his humanism . There were times , it is true , when , lending too credulous an ear to that Brahms clique of which he himself was never really a member , he tried too obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he had been cast by the anti-Wagnerians and anti-Lisztians ; and when he does that he can be woefully empty and exceedingly tiresome . But when he is content to be just what nature made him ? an artist responsive to a few simple but profound and universal emotions for the perfect expression of which his technique as a miniaturist was extraordinarily adapted ? he touches us in a way peculiarly his own . His case is probably unique in music in that he says very much the same things in his last works as in his first , the only difference being the greater approfondissement of the expression in the later ones and the more consummate art in the weaving of the texture through which that expression is made manifest . He was truly a philosopher , if on a somewhat limited scale , by far the best of his philosophising being an emanation from the  | pensive melancholy that was the basis of his spiritual being . Moving works like the Alto Rhapsody ' ( 187o ) , the Song of Destiny ' ( 1871 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental strain of his moral and artistic nature in the middle period of its evolution . For the final and perfect expression of it we have to go to some of the exquisite pianoforte miniatures of his last years , such as the A major Intermezzo of op. 118 ( 1893 ) , or , best of all , perhaps the B minor Intermezzo of op. 119 ( also 1893 ) . But things like this were so authentically the voice not of Johannes Brahms alone but of all that was best in the soul of Germany in that epoch , that here and there in them it is almost impossible today to distinguish that voice from the voice of the later Wagner or from that of Wolf himself .  | 24th November 1929 A DISTINGUISHED dramatic critic , in a letter from which I quoted in one of my recent articles , referred to those colossal bores , Bruckner and Mahler ' . In a month or so the London public will have an opportunity to hear Mahler 's Lied von der Erde ' ; and if the audience on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a colossal bore I shall give up musical criticism . Later in the season we shall hear his eighth symphony ; it is certainly colossal , but whether our public will find it boring or not remains to be seen . Bruckner is virtually unknown to the present London musical generation , so that it was a bold venture on the part of Herr Klemperer to plunge it at once into one of the longest of the Bruckner symphonies ? the eighth , which plays for about seventy minutes . I can well believe that a great many people were rather tired at the end of it , but the state of mind of the few with whom I have been able to talk after the concert could hardly be described as boredom . It has to be admitted that , outside certain circles in Austria and Germany , Bruckner 's music still makes little headway . But there is a substantial German literature dealing with him , and his admirers have always included among them many people whose taste and judgement we must respect . Wagner may be presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all of Liszt 's oily complaisancy in the matter of other men 's work ; there was little of it that appealed to him , and he often carried frankness with regard to it to the point of rudeness . He declined to accept the dedication of a Bruckner symphony until he had satisfied himself that the work was deserving of that honour ; he studied the manuscripts of the third and the fourth , and then enthusiastically accepted the dedication of the former . The critical Hugo Wolf was a strong 13rucknerian , though he was not blind to the man 's faults ; and since his day there have been too many good musicians on the side of Bruckner to permit of our rubbing him off the slate with a single contemptuous gesture .  | One of the reasons for the failure of Bruckner to establish himself in our concert-rooms is the sad fact that he is a composer with a unique faculty for tailing-off . Few of his movements are quite as good at the end as they promised to be at the start , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The public does not as yet know him well enough to be able to exercise the same charity towards him as it does towards other composers who also have a tendency to strain its endurance now and then . If Wagner or Beethoven or Bach or Brahms or Strauss strikes a dull patch , we set our teeth and wait till he is through with it , knowing that before long something will come to more than compensate us for our suffering . But as yet the plain man does not know his Bruckner well enough for that ; and in any case there is the unfortunate fact to which I have just referred , that it is generally in the last quarter of an hour or so that Bruckner deflates our enthusiasm . But there is so much fine stuff in his work that it is worth while making an effort to establish him in the repertory . I would suggest beginning either with the third symphony ( the Tragic ' ) or the fourth ( the Romantic ' ) , each of which has the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or even ? though the idea may horrify some people ? giving now and then an isolated movement at a concert . It would be impossible , I am sure , for the average music-lover to hear the opening movement of the third or that of the fourth symphony , or the Scherzi of the fourth and the eighth , or the impressive adagio of the seventh ( written in foreboding of the death of Bruckner 's adored Wagner ) , without realising that here is a composer who , with all his faults , is deserving of more serious attention than has yet been given him in this country . His faults are so obvious in themselves and so faithfully reproduced in one work after another that it takes only a little time to familiarise ourselves with them and to turn a tolerant ear on them . Bruckner the musician was as naive as Bruckner the man . His mental world was not a very wide one , yet he seems to have been constitutionally incapable of exercising within it that self-criticism that is even more essential to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reason that in the former case there is bound to be less of that element of surprise  | that in the other cases will suddenly take us out of ourselves and make us oblivious of patches of routine dullness . We need not dwell on the more obvious mannerisms of Bruckner 's music , such as his liking for phrases ( especially in his second subjects ) made up of two crotchets followed by a group of three crotchets with the value of two . As I have recently remarked , every composer , great or small , is in the depths of his subconsciousness a machine functioning blindly according to rule and expressing himself in persistently recurrent formula . A formula such as this of Bruckner 's merely arouses general comment because there is no missing it by the most casual listener ; but there is no composer whatever without his formule . The difference between a composer like Beethoven or Wagner or Chopin or Strauss and one like Bruckner is not that the latter is the slave of mannerisms while the former is free of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic formula again and again for what is basically the same mood , will give it each time so new a turn that the average listener never suspects the presence of a formula , whereas a Bruckner uses the formula time after time in terms so little different from each other that it is instantly recognised and labelled as a mannerism . The question is not whether a composer is a machine or not  --  - for all composers are that over a considerable area of their minds ? but the extent to which the machine can be made to present varying aspects of thought . It is here that a Beethoven shows his range and a Bruckner his limitations . A few simple ideas and antitheses sufficed Bruckner from first to last . Dr. Alfred Einstein , in his admirable article in the new Grove , tells us that above all else , Bruckner 's symphonic idea is pure music , quite untouched by the poetic or " programme " influences of his time ' . On the other hand , Dr. Ernst Decsey , in his notes for last Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a programme . Both are right , and both wrong . Bruckner may not have worked to a consciously formulated programme , but undoubtedly all his music was controlled by a simple sequence of ideas that can be roughly paraphrased along some such lines as those adopted by Dr. Decsey . The German commentators who sum Bruckner 's music up as  | being in about equal parts the expression of Nature and of God have got as near the root of the matter as anyone can hope to do in words . The basis of this music is a certain racial or ancestral mentality that is nourished by a strong feeling for nature and an equally strong sense of the conventional relations between God and man , or between man and the world . Always we come upon the same impression of struggle , defeat , victory , of difficulty and doubt ended by religious consolation or philosophical illumination . Almost always there is the same leaning towards the chorale or the flashing fanfare at certain points in the structure of the first movement , the same simple joy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dancing instinct in the scherzo . Where Bruckner misses real greatness , in spite of the beauty and the high-mindedness of so many of his pages , is in his structure . He generally plans on a bigger scale than his naive genius will allow him to carry out . Sometimes he throws up pillars as huge and as widely spaced as those of Beethoven on the first movement of the Ninth ; but he can neither plan the consistent filling of the spaces between nor bring to them material strong enough to stand the strain . His sequences , his repetitions , his pauses , his rhetorical gestures , his sudden bursts of energy , no doubt corresponded to something more or less definitely programmatic at the back of his mind . But whatever the basic non-musical idea may have been , it has not been fully transformed into the substance of music before being committed to paper , and so , instead of growing organically from point to point qua music , conveying its own logic to the musical consciousness of the listener , it merely uses music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this frequent failure to make the musical tissue coherent and consistent in itself that baffles and tires the hearer in a long Bruckner movement , as in the far-flung first movement of the fifth symphony , for example . But the case against him in this respect must not be pressed too harshly . When all his failures have been written off , there remains enough good music to justify more frequent performance of his symphonies than they receive at present .  | 7th March 1937 IN view of the concert performance of Busoni 's opera Doktor Faust ' by the B.B.C. on the 17th of this month , some preliminary remarks on that work , and on Busoni 's attitude towards opera in general , may be of interest to those of my readers who intend to listen-in that evening . Busoni died in July , 1924 , so that his brochure of 1926 on the possibilities of opera ( Uber die Moglichkeiten der Oper and fiber die Partitur des " Doktor Faust " ' ) is a posthumous publication . One gathers that it was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , some four or five years earlier . There was a good deal of discussion of the problem of opera going on in Germany about that time : in 1925 Ernst Krenek published an interesting essay on the subject , while in the following year the late Hermann Abert , the leading European authority on Mozart , brought out a suggestive brochure entitled Grundprobleme der Operngeschichte ' . The opera question , in fact , was once more in the air , as indeed it has been now , intermittently , for over three hundred years . I am not sure , for a reason that will be given later in this article , that all our talk about the problem of opera gets us very much nearer to a solution of it : but a problem of opera there always has been and always will be . I think I have already , in some article or other , put forward the thesis that opera is the most vital of all musical genres , because it confronts practitioners and listeners with ever new problems . This is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible permutations and combinations . It is compounded of vocal music , orchestral music , words , dramatic motives , dramatic action , scenery and miming : and not only are these prime factors capable of various mixtures at any one period but each of them varies , both in itself and in relation to the others , from generation to generation . What we may call the problem of opera , then ? the best way of making these factors co-operate  | will never be finally solved ; for the factors themselves are perpetually changing . Each artistic epoch in turn despises , or is patronisingly tolerant of , the opera form of its predecessors , and more especially of its immediate predecessor ; and the mocker soon becomes , in its turn , the mocked . New ideals spring up with new culture-conditions ; each epoch fondly believes that it , at last , has solved the problem for good ; and each supposedly final solution proves , in time , to have been only a temporary solution . Progress in art is possible only by any given epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . In this way a disequilibrium is in time produced ; and then the instincts both of the creative artists and of thoughtful spectators lead them to concentrate on some other factor . This in turn becomes , in consequence , relatively over-developed ; then an attempt at a new equilibrium becomes necessary ; and so ad infinitum . The first essays in opera aimed at dramatic continuity without what we of today would call an organic form . When the sense of form asserted itself the musical units in opera became stylised , and in the end mechanical and tyrannic . These stylised forms were then found to be something of a hindrance to the naturalistic element in drama ; and to give this freer play the forms were deprived of some of their old excess of authority . In the last great historical development ? the Wagnerian music drama ? we find ourselves at the furthest end of the swing of the pendulum from , say , the Handelian opera . This latter was static , formal , stylised , both dramatically and musically ; Wagner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by giving the drama more rights , or at any rate new rights , and by making the music continuous from the beginning to the end of each act . But we now see that the Wagnerian form is not necessarily law-giving for all time ; it was in part the product of the impact of a number of historical forces upon each other in a particular epoch , in part the personal expression of a man of highly individual genius . Wagner himself would have been the first to deny that he had fixed the final form of opera , or that any vital new development could come by other people adopting his methods : it was one of his theses , indeed , that the  | new spirit of each age must make its own art out of its own material and its own necessities , and that only stagnation can ensue when artists imitate older forms without being themselves part and parcel of the historic conditions that had evolved those forms by an inner organic process . It is as natural and right , therefore , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of opera as that Wagner , Gluck and others should have revolted against the typical eighteenth century form , or that the Italians of the second half of the seventeenth century should have turned their backs on the Florentines and Monteverdi , or that these latter should have tried to establish a different relation between words and music than was possible in sixteenth century polyphonic music . And as Wagner laid such stress on the drama in his own opera , it is a perfectly natural present-day development that the pendulum should now be swinging back , at any rate in theory , towards the musical element in opera . This will prove in the long run , on historical analogy , to be only a temporal phase ; but for the moment it seems to be the vital phase . The musicians are everywhere claiming that the new opera will have to be born out of the spirit of music : Krenek , in his very suggestive essay , claims that the inner life of the musical tissue of the new opera will have to determine everything else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the acting , the lighting , the setting , and so on . Unfortunately he neglects either to tell us exactly how this is to be done or to provide us with a demonstration of how it can be done , or what it will all look and sound like when it is . Still , his essay is interesting as indicative of a trend . What all the theorists fail to perceive is that no amount of mere talk will solve the newest problem of opera . The solution , as was the case with Wagner , will come only from some creator of genius . For more than a hundred years before Wagner the thinkers of Italy and Germany had been demonstrating in the most logical way what was wrong with contemporary opera and the ways in which it might be reformed : in the actual year of Wagner 's birth one Mosel published a book that contained , in embryo , practically everything that Wagner had to say on the subject later . But all this brave talk would have come to nothing  | but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been supplying the modern opera writer with a wealth of new material and new resource , and that nature happened to throw up in the post-Beethoven epoch , in the person of Wagner , the one man who was capable of using this material and these resources to supply the music drama with the vitamin it needed for the next stage of its growth . And we may take it for granted that , let the theoreticians speculate as they will , the newest problem of opera will not be solved until some supreme creative artist solves it not by reasoning but by intuition . Meanwhile , however , the speculations are very interesting as far as they go . Busoni , of course , gets no nearer a valid solution than any of the others . He never really solved any problem , not even his own most pressing individual ones : what he does , in all his prose writings , is to throw out a number of penetrating remarks on aesthetics , along with a number of other remarks that are more noticeable for their oddity than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , that a love duet on the stage is not only shameless but downright false ' . His strange argument is that anyone who has ever been in the company of two lovers has felt that he is de trop , and that in a theatre the audience is just a big multiplication of that third person who is not company ! He assures us that in the older opera there are no love duets ? an obiter dictum that prompts us to ask whether he had ever seen a score , for instance , of Handel 's Giulio Cesare ' ; nor does he pause to ask himself whether this ban of his ought not to be extended , by parity of reasoning , to many other situations in opera in which two or more people who are ostensibly concerned only with themselves are made to open a window in their souls for the benefit of the spectator . The fact is that Busoni is here , as everywhere else , merely generalising from his own artistic bias : he is obeying the natural impulse of the artist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the norm for all other artists . So again with his verdict that the ideal opera is the Magic Flute ' ; that dictum is merely the product of the craving for satisfaction of certain mystical elements in his own complex nature during his last years . But if Busoni 's brochure , with its alternation of pure absurdi-  | tics and flashes of the most piercing insight , does not carry us very far in our search for the ideal form and contents of the opera of the future , his own attempt to solve the problem in his Doktor Faust ' is both interesting and instructive . I will deal with the dramatic plan of that work in a following article . 14th March 1937 T HERE are few composers who have not had , at some time or another , the idea of either making an opera or a symphony or a symphonic poem out of the Faust subject ; it has an almost irresistible attraction for the philosophical mind . For all that , we may doubt whether , in its entirety , it is really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the more popular treatinents of it , such as those of Berlioz , Liszt , and Gounod , confine themselves to the First Part of Goethe 's enormous work ? the romantic story of a man , a maid and a devil . As readers of Goethe 's Second Part know it is only after the Gretchen episode is finished with that Faust becomes a real subject for philosophical poetry . But this Second Part has so far defied reduction to operatic form , though Schuman wrote some fine music for certain episodes from it . The subject could not fail to attract a mind so given to philosophical brooding as Busoni 's . His thinking about the problem of opera seems to have led him to much the same conclusion with regard to it as the well-known one of Wagner , who laid it down that the best field for opera is the myth , in which we see life in its most purely human ' form . ( The Meistersinger ' , of course , is not derived from a myth ; but Wagner 's later practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Busoni saw that the ideal opera subject , for him at any rate , would have to deal with some figure historically remote enough from us of today to have to become generalised , quintessentialised , yet near enough to us to permit of our seeing ourselves and him . He thought in turn of Merlin , Don Juan , and the Faust of Goethe . The Don Juan theme he rejected because of its association with Mozart 's great music , though , as he rightly says , a modern treatment of the Don Juan legend is conceivable  | in which the many episodes not dealt with by Da Ponte could be turned to good use . The pull of Goethe 's poem upon Busoni was very strong , but he was appalled , as he well might be , by the difficulty of the task of reducing that huge mass to the dimensions of music . In the end the Faust subject forced itself irresistibly upon him ; but he thought to solve his problem by making a Faust ' of his own , not out of Goethe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so popular in Germany for three hundred years , and the verbal traditions of which have been sought out by various scholars during the second half of the nineteenth century . Reconstruction of these puppet plays was difficult , because each touring troup guarded its own dialogue jealously from possible plagiarism by others . But though Busoni went back directly to the Puppenspiele for his incidents , he could not , of course , escape Goethe 's influence upon the philosophy of his drama . That influence of itself was sufficient to create certain difficulties for him , because the operatic form of a single evening does not suffice for a convincing elaboration of the Faust ' psychology as we moderns conceive it . Upon this point I shall touch later . Meanwhile it has to be noted that the puppet play itself piled up a number of difficulties for Busoni . It does not appear to have been observed that the puppet play was such a roaring success with the populace precisely because it was a puppet play ; that is to say , it was a perfect adaptation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too much to say that only the puppet stage can present the traditional Faust ' story adequately . The sudden appearances and exits of the characters , and certain incidents in the handling of the story , were the easiest thing imaginable when all that was required was the jerking of a string ; but there is no place for them on the ordinary stage . At the point , for instance , when Faust was to sign the compact with Mephistopheles , Busoni makes a raven fly in with a pen in its beak . This is typical of the kind of action that was simplicity itself on a puppet stage , but that raises a smile in the spectator of a modern Faust drama . The puppet stage , again , could deal with complete ease with the various episodes ? the raising of Herod and Salome , Samson  | and Delilah , Helen of Troy , Lucretia , Judith and Holofernes , and so on ? that are designed to demonstrate Faust 's magic powers . But in the first place this kind of thing is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second place , as these episodes have to be made acceptable to us , have to be psychologically inwrought with the substance of the drama , the stage playwright has either to spend an excessive amount of time in setting forth to us the inner meaning of them or to present them in mere sequence , the connection of which is not , and can not be , made clear to us . Busoni failed to solve this central problem . His drama opens with a symphonic prelude , followed by a chorus , behind the scenes , singing an Easter hymn . Then the curtain rises and we see the poet , who recites ten stanzas in which Busoni expounds his views upon Opera and gives us his reasons for having finally settled on the Faust subject after having rejected those of Merlin and Don Juan . The first scene proper of the play takes place in Faust 's study in Wittenberg . Three mysterious students from Cracow enter and present Faust with the magic book ? Claris Astartis Magica ? a key , and some title deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the joys of love , universal fame , in return for the surrender of his soul in due time . Busoni seems to me to have been not quite clear as to his own Faust at this stage . He presents him , at one moment , as a mere arrogant , revengeful thirster after magical power , almost a second Alberich ; moreover a man of dubious life who needs Mephistopheles ' assistance to help him outrun the constable ; he has offended the priests , his cheated creditors are at his heels , his life is being sought by the soldier brothers of the girl he has seduced . Yet when Faust is thinking of accepting the aid of the devil he becomes a pure idealist , whose one desire is to embrace the world in his thought , to have genius and know the sufferings of genius , and so on . liusoni seems , in fact , to be oscillating between the cruder Faust of the puppet plays and the highly intellectualised , philosophical Faust of Goethe . The next scene , a powerfully imaginative piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven 's help in the slaying of his sister 's betrayer . Mephistopheles , disguised as a  | monk , plays cruelly with the wretched man , who is ultimately killed by an armed patrol . The earliest scenes arc styled by Busoni the Prelude , and the scene in the minster is described as an Intermezzo . His drama proper , we are given to understand , commences with the next scene . Following closely the puppet plays , Busoni now takes Faust to Parma . It is the wedding day of the Duke and Duchess . Faust exhibits his magic art , calling in turn Solomon and the Queen of Sheba , Samson and Delilah , and John the Baptist and Salome . In the last of these traditional tableaux the executioner has the lineaments of the Duke . As he raises his sword over the Baptist 's head a cry breaks from the Duchess . Faust already has her in his ban . After the stage has been cleared of everyone the Duchess reappears alone wildly confessing her love for Faust , with whom she flies from Parma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fresh marriage for political purposes . After a symphonic intermezzo ? the Sarabande that occasionally appears in our concert programmes ? we are plunged into a lively scene in a tavern in Wittenberg . There are some amusing disputes between the none too sober students . A Platonist smashes a plate by way of proving the Platonic doctrine of ' ideas ' : the plate , he says , is destroyed but does not the idea of a plate remain ? There is much argumentative thrust and counter-thrust between him , a student of theology , a jurist , a physicist , a group of Protestants and one of Catholics . Faust , who until now has been silent , proposes the toast of Martin Luther , the inspired author of the couplet in praise of wine , woman and song . This leads to new disputes , which end with the Protestants goose-stepping out of the room . Asked by the students to tell them about some of the women he must have met with in his travels , Faust begins to muse upon the episode , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is interrupted by the entry of Mephistopheles , dressed as a dust-covered courier , who tells him that the Duchess is dead , throws the dead body of her new-born child at his feet , and tells the students the whole story in a ballad that seems to be dragged in by the hair of its head for purely operatic reasons . At the end of it he shows that the body is only a puppet of  | straw , which he consumes with fire . He promises Faust a still better adventure ? with Helen of Troy , who , as in the puppet plays , now appears , only to vanish from Faust 's sight when he tries to clasp the ideal in his arms . It is now that Faust begins really to philosophise , in the true Goethean fashion , about life , its ends , its illusions , and if his sudden philosophising seems , dramatically speaking , to be insufficiently motivated , that impression increases in the final scene . It is a winter night in a street in Wittenberg by the minster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall stands a life-size crucifix . The night-watchman , as in the Puppenspiele ( and , we may add , in the Meistersinger ' ) , passes by at intervals , singing his familiar exhortation to the burghers . We see and hear the students once more , this time congratulating Faust 's former famulus , Wagner , on his inaugural address as Rector . When the stage is at last empty Faust enters . He sees a beggar cowering against one of the houses , a child in her arms . It is the Duchess of Parma : she hands the child to Faust bidding him , before midnight , complete the work ' ? though we are given no clear idea of what the work is to be . She disappears . Faust , after a vain attempt to enter the church , sinks , with the child in his arms , before the crucifix . By the light of the lantern of the returning night-watchman he sees the crucified one metamorphosed into Helen . He becomes more and more mystical , expressing himself in phrases that might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as untranslatable as those . He reaches out into the future , declaring himself an eternal will ' . He dies . The night-watchman , who is now seen to be Mephistopheles , appears once more , throws his light on to the face of Faust , and ejaculates , This man seems to have come to grief ! ' Meanwhile , from the place where the dead child lay arises a naked body , who , with upraised hand holding a bough in blossom , goes slowly into the town and the night . With due respect to Busoni , all this is the most egregious philosophical muddle that could be conceived . He never succeeds in making his mysticising clear to us , in large part because of the very nature of the construction of his drama he has to crowd it all into far too small a space in the end . Nor  | are matters much improved by the poet once more appearing on the stage and addressing the spectators , inviting them to fill out the symbolism of the story for themselves . Dramatically Doktor Faust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | 22nd April 1934 APART from its intrinsic merits , Hoist 's Choral Symphony ' is of particular interest because of the questions it raises as to possible combinations of words and music in the opera of the future , or in some new form that may branch out of opera . This is perhaps the most fertile field for musical development now . It may be taken as an axiom that the more homogeneous , and therefore closed ' , an art form is , the sooner it will exhaust its latent possibilities , because of the relatively small number of permutations and combinations of which its few factors are capable ; while in the nature of the case the composite forms are capable of more readjustments with regard ' to each other . For the time being it certainly looks as if purely instrumental music had come near the end of its formal resources : whereas opera keeps perpetually renewing itself , because there the co-operating factors of instrumental music , story , action , mise en scene , the sung word , the spoken word , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken , still make possible the creation of a large number of new forms . Let us glance at some of the future changes this principle may imply with regard to the relations between music and words . There is a type of musical constitution , of course , to which questions of this kind are of no interest . This type of musician has a mind that is essentially melodic , and melodic in a rather narrow sense ; being completely insensitive himself to the interest and the charm of the perfect blending of fine music and fine poetry or prose , he listens to Wolf , for example , with the expectation that the vocal line will be melodic ' in the Handelian or Schubertian sense ; not finding what he expects , he misses the very essence of the song , and , being himself not built by nature for the perception of this particular order of musical values , innocently assumes that the people who are sensitive to it are people of inferior musical taste to his own . That the deficiency may be in himself never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like this kind of music are as sensitive  | as he is to the other kind ? the more formally schematised melodic kind ? ought at least , one would think , make him ask himself whether what he regards as a superfine palate in himself is not merely a deficiency in aesthetic digestion . But there it is ; and we others can only extend to him the same large-handed consolation that Mr. George Robey , in a song of long ago , used to extend to those blessed souls who never miss the things they 've never had . Leaving these musical unfortunates to God , let those of us who owe to the combination of poetry and music some of the richest moments of our aesthetic life look at one or two of the problems that Mr. Hoist has posed for himself and for us . Paradoxical as it may sound , the ordinary song-melody is not a vocal melody at all , but an instrumental one ; ignoring the inner nerve of the words ? if they have one ? the refinements of accent or rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself according to laws of its own ; whence it comes about that a song or an aria like Handel 's Ombra mai fu ' or Schubert 's Am Meer ' , or Mozart 's Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd shhon ' goes just as well on a solo instrument as with a voice . ( How strong the pull of the old instrumental type of melody can be upon a modern composer is shown by Brahms 's treatment of the Bible texts in his Vier ernste Gesange ' ; the infinitely plastic prose is forced into the rectangular mould of abstract melody . ) But at an advanced stage in the development of vocal music both the composer and his listeners demand a type of vocal line which , while satisfying the musical ear , at the same time gives what I have called the inner nerve of the words its due . So the problem arises of finding a way of treating poetry ( or imaginative prose ) in music that will enable the composer and ourselves to draw upon the vast resources of our poetic sensibility while still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be solved in the future in a different way in each work according to the nature of the poem , the special kind of co-operation allotted to the music , and the general purpose of the whole . And it is already clear that a host of hitherto unsuspected difficulties will soon arise . Mr. Hoist begins his Choral Symphony ' with a long quasi-  | recitation by the chorus , on a single note , of the lines of Keats 's Invocation to Pan ' , the orchestra weaving a continuous tissue of its own above and under and around this level unison line . No other course was logically open to him . The moods and the images of the poem being an organic part of his musical emotion , he is justified in setting them before us . Yet a poem of this kind can not possibly be set in the old complacent melodic way , for there are poems , and this is one of them , that defy that kind of treatment . Mr. Hoist himself unconsciously proves this by his later handling of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the line for instance , Heard melodies are sweet ' . Why , we ask ourselves in astonishment , make the voices rise a fifth on the mel ' , and again on the ' sweet ' ? No one would dream of speaking the words with an intonation even remotely resembling this , while as a melody pure and simple the vocal line does not bear within itself its own justification . The truth is that Mr. Hoist has already settled upon that leap of a fifth as the cardinal feature in the orchestral figure upon which he has decided to construct this section of his movement . The orchestral idea is admirable in itself , and admirably worked out : but we part company both with poetic and with musical common sense when the vocal line is arbitrarily shaped in accordance with it . Here , it seems to me , Mr. Holst falls back into the very slough from which , in so many other parts of his fine work , he is trying to rescue poetry . His procedure is more convincing when , as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet 's words , thus defining for us the imaginative world of the poem and leaving it to the orchestra to intensify the poetic suggestion in its own way . I can conceive expressive use being made of this device in a new genre of opera , in which fine music could be linked with the finest poetry . But at once a practical difficulty arises . Mr. Hoist , who evidently has an exceptionally sensitive ear for the delicacies and subtleties of poetic rhythm ? which , as our Shakespearean actors and actresses demonstrate , not one person in ten thousand has ? writes out the one note of the chorus in crotchets , quavers , and semiquavers that approximately reproduce , in their totality ,  | the way in which Keats 's lines would be spoken by a reader with an exquisite sense of poetic accent and rhythm . I say approximately ' because , of course , these musical timevalues , being based on set multiples of a metrical unit , can not possibly indicate the refinements of time-values in rhythmic speech . If we were to chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem we should indeed get , in broad outline , the time-values noted by Mr. Hoist ; but at every point they would be subtly modified in a way that is difficult , if not impossible , in music . The difficulty is increased when , as in the present instance , the delivery of the lines is entrusted not to a soloist but to a choir ; for a choir can only keep in with itself and with the steady musical flow of the orchestral commentary by a certain amount of insistence on beats and bars , and this insistence , even if as slight as in the admirable delivery of the lines by the B.B.C. Chorus the other evening , jars somewhat upon the ear of a listener who is sensitive to the more esoteric subtleties of verbal rhythm . I dwell upon this point not in order to disparage the fine effort Mr. Holst has made , in the Choral Symphony ' , to effect a new union of poetry and music , but merely to point out the extraordinary difficulties that are bound to arise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome ? And for whom , indeed , will they be overcome ? A work in which these problems of the subtlest interfusion of poetry and music were solved would be a work for merely a handful of listeners who were themselves at once musicians and poets . La donna e mobile ' and Celeste Aida ' will always , I am afraid , be the shortest cut of the greatest number to the greatest musical happiness .  | 17th March 1929 THE assiduous reader of this column ? apparently there are still a few of them left , in spite of everything ! ? may have noticed sundry references of late to Krszmaly , whose works I have persistently pressed upon the attention of British music lovers . I find that the name of this composer is quite unknown here , and I have received letters from various parts of the country asking me for further information about him ; I have even been approached by the musical adviser of one of our biggest and most enterprising concert organisations , which is anxious to include some of Krszmaly 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to say about Krszmaly until I could treat him and his music at proper length in a book ; but in view of the widespread interest that my brief references to him have evoked I have pleasure in giving a few particulars about him here . Let me say , in passing , that I have been deeply wounded by a suggestion , on the part of a friend who , as the now silent Mr. Kurt Atterberg would say , has a sharp nose ' , that there is no such person ? that I invented him , in fact . As if I would do such a thing ! Not that there would be anything really unprofessional about such conduct ; for most writers upon music have , in their time , discovered a composer who , since no one else has ever been aware of his existence , can be regarded only as the critic 's own invention . Mr. Turner , for instance , frequently writes about a composer named Wagner who , I suspect , never existed outside Mr. Turner 's imagination : at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Wagner I know . Then there is Sir Henry Hadow 's Berlioz , again ? a figment , surely , of that gifted humorist 's fancy . And of course there is Mr. Kurt Atterberg , a quite original composer , if Mr. Atterberg 's word is to be trusted , but whom I suspect to be the creation of Mr. Atterberg , the music critic . There would be nothing , then , inconsistent with the loftiest principles of the craft were I also to invent a composer of my  | own . But what need is there for me to set my imagination to work when the Fates have provided me with Krszmaly ready to my hand ? I must admit that I was on the look-out for a composer whom I could be the first to introduce to the British public , for only in that way can a critic hope to achieve fame . It is so difficult nowadays to say anything notable about a classical composer ; besides , that could hardly be done without an exhaustive study of him off one 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing takes time . It is much easier to find a composer of whom no one else has heard and be his John the Baptist . I was looking round , then , for a new composer on whose shoulders I could climb to fame , or at any rate notoriety , when chance brought Krszmaly my way . At once I saw my opportunity . For here is a composer who is not only , in my humble opinion , the greatest figure in the music of our own time but destined to have an enormous influence on the future . As a distinguished critic said some ten years ago , when announcing one of his own discoveries ' ? a young man of thirty-six whom I do not know , whom I have never seen , and whom I regard as one of the most remarkable composers of his generation , a young man from whom may be expected not merely interesting works but works of the first order ' , etc. , etc. ? I do not think there is any greater joy than that of discovering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely how I feel about it . Everything else I have written will soon be forgotten ; but one of these days I shall perhaps be asked to supply some biographical information about myself to a dictionary of music , and then I shall be able to point , with pride , to the fact that I was the first man in England to write on Krszmaly . ( The name , I hope , will not be an obstacle to his fame in this country . Franz Bohme , in his Geschichte des Tanzes in Deutschland , tells us of the sad fate of a Prague composer of about 182o to whom the historians of music have never done elementary justice simply because no one could pronounce his name , which was Anton Krch . There ought to be no such difficulty with Krszmaly . The name is pronounced exactly as it is spelt ? the Krsz ' like krsz in krsz , and the a ' broad with a slightly guttural inflection. )  | Krszmaly , whom I regard as the greatest composer that Hungary has yet produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Albanian of the hills , was the commander of one of the largest submarines in the Swiss navy ; his mother was a Dirne of the purest blood . Great men , as Schopenhauer pointed out , derive their genius from their mothers ; and it was undoubtedly from his mother that Krszmaly drew not only his genius but that rich store of Latvian folk melody that , ripened and transformed in obedience to the necessities of the new time , was one day to make him the very incarnation of the Dalmatian national spirit in music . He was educated at the Leipzig Conservatoire ; but even as a boy he rebelled against the sterile academicism of his teachers . He had to make his own technique if he was ever to express himself ; and this he did by turning to new and unexpected uses the hitherto unsuspected harmonic wealth of the popular music of his native Illyria . In no living composer , indeed , is the folk-element so strong as in Krszmaly : I need point , in proof of this statement , only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the most Boeotian-minded of present-day Boeotians can not listen without feeling that the composer is the very soul , poetic as well as musical , of Bceotia . His already large output includes four string quartets , two operas ? Prc Zstvo Vestcs ' and Mrzovitl , Mrzovatl , Mrzovotl ' ? and no fewer than seven symphonies , of which the last , the Sinfonia Moronesque ' , has been accepted by all the inhabitants of Moronia as the truest expression yet achieved of the Moron mentality . It was after the first performance of this masterpiece that the King of the Morons made Krszmaly his Court Composer . Outside Moronia , however , where his name is now a household word , this symphony drew upon Krszmaly 's head the bitterest objurgation of the more reactionary critics of each country . Yet it was this very work , so daring , so original , so future-piercing , that made me his passionate admirer : it appealed irresistibly to the Sister Anne in me . A letter in which I poured forth my admiration won for me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I was allowed to be the sole hearer , besides the composer , of his revolutionary Concentus Silens ' . In this astounding work Krszmaly has  | written nothing but rests . He was the first composer , indeed , to perceive and exploit the possibilities of the rest ; and the mere sight of this score , with its many time-signatures , its syncopated rests , its cross-rhythm rests , its bewildering polyphony ( if the term may be permitted me ) of rests , should be enough to convince the most sceptical of the profound originality of Krszmaly 's genius . The work was performed by a select choir of Trappist monks on 1st April 1927 . In his Chant du Fou ' he has carried Schonberg 's atonalism a stage further . Any one note of the twelve-tone scale ' , says Schonberg , is as good as another . ' Krszmaly has clinched this with And better ! ' Here he has made music , for the first time , four-dimensional ; no note means just what it purports to mean , but something quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the notes have to be seen in their correct focus ? which of course means an adjustment of the lens ( if the term may be permitted me ) of the ear of which few people are as yet capable . ( The full score is not yet published ; a simplified focal score has been issued , however , for the use of the layman . ) It was this revolutionary work that led to the disgraceful exhibition of hooliganism at the last Festival ( in Zagreb ) of the International Society for Contemptible Music . Krszmaly , on that memorable occasion , learned what it means to a pioneer to be in advance of his time . Courageous as he is , sure of himself and his immortality as he is , the hostile reception of this masterpiece broke his heart . He flung himself sobbing on my shoulder : Prszbsl ! Prszbsl ! ' ( ' Oh my God ! ' ) he wailed in his soft native Icelandic . It is this great work , however , by which Krszmaly is , I learn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be broadcast at an early date : my suggestion for its performance was so strongly backed by the manufacturers of wireless receiving sets that the B.B.C. , though with sore misgivings , had to yield to the clamour . I have no fear for Krszmaly in this country , for here we know how to honour great musicians . Has not the gifted composer of Sleep , baby , sleep ' , recently received a knighthood , while even the producer of relative trifles like Sea Drift ' , Paris ' , and The Mass of Life ' has been awarded the lesser distinction of a Companionship of Honour ? Footnote  | Footnote  | DEATH OF A GENIUS 6th February 1949 ONE or two readers with long memories may recall that many years ago I contributed to the Sunday Times a brief biography and critical study of a great but quite unknown composer named Krszmaly . I pleaded his claim to recognition so eloquently , especially in connection with a string quartet of his , that I received from one of the more advanced thinkers at Broadcasting House an enquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained . I now grieve to have to announce the death of this great composer . The sad news reached me by secret channels some three weeks ago , when I was absorbed as usual in my morning devotions at the centre shrine of the Monte Carlo Casino ; and the shock was so great that I had no heart to attend evensong there that day . Since my return to England I have been searching for that old article of mine , in order to give my readers a few authentic details of Krszmaly 's career . But I ca n't find it and I hesitate to write his biography afresh now for fear that if it should differ to any great extent from that of twenty years or so ago , as it conceivably might , a few uncharitable persons might accuse me of drawing upon my imagination for my facts . All that I can be sure of now is that Krszmaly , as his music so abundantly shows , had the good fortune to be free of any definitely national taint . His father , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander of a submarine in the Swiss navy , while his mother came from one of the most ancient of Viennese families , the Von and Zu Dirnen . Further back there were international complications in his heredity into which I can not enter in detail now . His pedigree is a matter to which I attach great importance , as I have always held that the best results in music can come only from the crossing of breeds : Grieg , for instance , was half-Scottish , Beethoven was  | half-Flemish , Johann Strauss was half-Spanish , and Bruckner was half-witted . In the years following the First World War , when musical geniuses who made Bach and Beethoven and Wagner look like ten cents were being discovered every month , there was a competition among our musical journalists for the honour of having been the first in this country to write about So-and-So ' . No one , I think , will dispute my claim to have been not only the first but the only critic to discover Krszmaly . To me alone he showed , with me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even claim , without any lapse from modesty , to have been partly instrumental in setting him on his path , till then untrodden , that was to bring him at last to his greatest achievement , the Silent Symphony ' . It came about in this way . In the 19205 there used to be much talk among composers and critics about the need for a new music that would be free of the elephantiasis , as it was called , of those German masters whom the world , in its besotted ignorance , had till then mistakenly regarded as great . Too many notes ! ' was the cry , too spread-out forms ! too much padding ! ' Krszmaly had long been working in solitude and secrecy along the new lines of compression and restraint , when one day he lighted on an article of mine on Mossolov 's Music of Machines ' and Honneger 's Pacific 231 ' . The purpose of these works , I pointed out , was to rescue music from the tyranny of ideas and bring it back to its first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two gifted composers I have mentioned had gone some distance in that direction , but not far enough . They had imitated to perfection the noises of the machines in a factory , a railway engine getting up steam , the grinding of brakes and so on . But they had made one fatal mistake ? they had timorously approached the great modern problem of noise via music , of which there was still too much in their scores . The logical conclusion of it all , I argued , would be a sound-complex in which the noises would be left in and the music left out . It was left to Krszmaly 's inexorably logical mind to draw the right conclusion of which even I had not dreamed . If the fewer notes a work has the better , he argues , then obviously the perfect  | work will be one with no notes at all . He was influenced to some extent in this opinion by some lines he had come across in the great Turkish poet Ushabei Bhebe : I will not quote them in the original , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodies are sweet , but those unheard are sweeter ' . In a flash Krszmaly saw to the end of his problem : If ' , I remember him asking me one day in his quaint English , the fire of the born mystic blazing in his beautiful eyes ? one pupil , by the way , was noticeably larger than the other ? ' if nobody hear the dam things , why for I go to trouble of write them ? ' So he devoted the final years of his life to the working out of his magnum opus , the manuscript of which lies open before me as I write ? the Silent Symphony ' , some notion of which I will try to convey to the reader in my next article . I earnestly commend it to the notice of the B.B.C. ; it would make an ideal opening for the next development , now a little overdue at Broadcasting House ? the Fourth Programme . 13th February I949 I PROMISED last Sunday to tell my readers something about the crowning achievement of Krszmaly 's last years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the influences that contributed to the making of that masterpiece . Underlying them all was the principle insisted on by all the best composers and critics of the nineteen-twenties , that there were too many notes in the classics ; Bach , for example , positively spawned semiquavers . But it took a genius like Krszmaly to draw the logical conclusion from it all ? that if , ex hypothesi , a wineglassful of notes is better than a bucketful , then the wincglassful must yield the palm to the thimbleful , and so , carrying the process of compression to its logical end , the ideal number of notes in a piece of modern music must be no notes at all . It was the metaphysician and the mystic in Krszmaly that drove him on inexorably to this dazzling conclusion . Always he was in quest of the noumenon behind phenomena . I first  | became aware of this metaphysical-mystical strain in him when he began to collect holes , claiming that these were the true ultimate realities of space . What , he asked me one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hole ? The mind emancipated from the illusions of the empirical , he contended , ought to be able to conceive the size and shape and quality of a hole without the help of the customary material surround to it . What threw him into a mystical ecstasy was the concept of the hole per se , the Loch an sich , as Kant would have expressed it . In his later years Krszmaly collected holes as simpler-minded people collect stamps or netsuke , and he was never happier than when showing his collection to distinguished visitors ; he was particularly proud of a hole , acquired at great expense , that was once in a sock of Mr. Gladstone 's . I could not always follow him in these daring metaphysicalmystical flights ; but I am proud to think I contributed something to his theory of the quintessential abstract in art by bringing to his notice striking instances of the kind that cropped up in my own experience . I remember showing him one day a newspaper cutting that was entirely blank except for two small half-circles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture in this country , I assured him , who would not recognise this at once as a quintessential portrait of Mr. George Robey . The eyebrows , I said , were the Robey noumenon , Robey an sick : a bare suggestion of these was enough , our imagination doing the rest . Krszmaly was greatly impressed by this triumph of abstraction in one of the visual arts . But his superb logical faculty at once carried the problem a stage further ? why should not the art of abstraction go beyond even this , conjuring up Mr. Robey for us without even the trifling lapse into the representational implied in the semicircles ? I had to confess that I could not at the moment see how anything of this sort could be done in music . But Krszmaly 's powerful brain never ceased to work at that problem , and one day , quite accidentally , I put him on the right path . I had been telling him of a famous English cat that by slow stages rid itself of materiality until nothing remained of it but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin to his collection of famous holes . ) At last he saw the light ; he would  | create a new species of music that would be to all previous music what the immaterial grin was to the material cat , a music which would scrap entirely the crude apparatus of sound and consist wholly of rests . So , bit by painful bit , the Silent Symphony ' came into being . ( After all , he remarked jocularly to me one day , are not the rests the best part of a modern work ? ) But it cost him fifteen years of hard thinking to perfect the new genre . His problem was a triple one . First of all he had to create a new type of melody composed entirely of rests crystallising into exquisite designs . ( Keats , I am sure , would have agreed with me that these silent melodies of Krszmaly 's are the sweetest ever unheard . ) Next he had to elaborate a harmony of rests based on the subtle natural differences between the consonances and dissonances of silence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of it : he was even working at a theory and practice of atonal rests when he died . Last of all , and this was his greatest triumph , came an amazing counterpoint of rests . Only the photographic reproduction of a full page of the Silent Symphony ' , for which my editor churlishly refuses me a whole page of today 's issue of the Sunday Times , could give the reader an idea of the ingenuity of this counterpoint , which makes the art of the old Netherlanders look like nursery stuff . Imagine the technical difficulties of imitation , inversion , augmentation , diminution , stretto , fugue , mirror fugue , canon , crab canon , lobster canon ( this last ingenious device is Krszmaly 's own invention ) and so on , when transferred from the too easy sphere of material sound to the immaterial world of silence ! And now , I ask again , what are the B.B.C. going to do about it ? Failing them , I look to the gramophone companies , and failing them the Arts Council . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor who can get to the heart of the Silent Symphony ' and an orchestra that can be trusted to count accurately through the soundless mazes of it .  | 28th February 1932 MR . VAN DIEREN 'S recent articles in the Daily Telegraph on Meyerbeer raise some very interesting points . Whether it would be possible to get Meyerbeer into the ordinary English repertory , or , having got him there , to keep him there , may be open to doubt . But an occasional performance of one or two of his operas would surely be an attraction , if only the performances were adequate . A production such as the one we had of the Huguenots ' at Covent Garden a few years ago is not merely useless , but harmful ; the poor composer is damned for the allround incompetence of his performers and producers . But a properly sung , properly played , properly staged performance of one of the operas would presumably be as successful in London as in any Continental or American town . It would certainly give the public something to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Dinorah ' and L'Africaine ' in New York some years ago , and was strangely impressed by them . I found myself repelled by the man 's mind , yet paradoxically unable to get away from it and the psychological problems it called up ; the music seemed to me like those strange scents that create a faint nausea in us , but for some reason or other make it difficult for us to escape their unpleasantness by the simple process of keeping away from them . This view of Meyerbeer , of course , may be a purely personal one , though when I talked it over with one of my New York colleagues I found that he agreed with me . But I wonder whether Meyerbeer may not have affected his contemporary audiences to some extent in somewhat the same way ? whether some people did not find the odour of the man 's mind just a little unpleasant , but were still unable to shake themselves free of its curious fascination . We shall never , of course , be able to hear Meyerbeer as his contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we with them . But a little study of contemporary Meyerbeer  | criticism helps us to see the matter as the audiences of the eighteen-thirties and forties saw it , and so to understand how it was that Meyerbeer achieved so colossal a reputation in his own day . In one respect , indeed , his music is as remarkable now as it was then ? in the strange beauty , the curiously searching quality , of some of his orchestral combinations . If these things surprise and fascinate us today , after a century of marvellous orchestral developments , we can imagine the effect they must have had on audiences to whom they were entirely new . But in the main , Meyerbeer 's hold upon his own generation depended upon something that can not possibly ever be reproduced for our generation or any succeeding one . He was the man of the moment , the incarnation of the spirit of the time . The world of the thirties and forties saw itself reflected in him more completely than in any other composer of the epoch . And precisely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the very soul of his generation , he has lost the bulk of his old significance , for we of today can not bring to this music what the men of Meyerbeer 's day brought to it . A little research into the criticism of that period makes it quite clear that what mostly attracted people to Meyerbeer was the consciousness that he was the mirror of themselves and of the epoch . Heine , who was not specifically a musician , but was a shrewd observer of men and manners and social changes , has explained it all in a way that is as convincing now as it was a century ago . Heine , writing from Paris about 1837 , says that Rossini 's vogue was then declining somewhat . The predominant factor in Rossini 's music , he says , is melody , which is the expression of man as individual ; whereas the predominating factor in Meyerbeer 's music is harmony , which expresses man in his communal aspects . For this reason , he goes on to say , Rossini 's music was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agitated and self-conscious humanity of the immediate post-Napoleon epoch , a humanity intent on its personal joys and sorrows , loves and hates , longings and despairs . But after the July Revolution ( 183o ) a new consciousness had developed in Europe , a consciousness of the need for reconstruction in politics , in business , in social life , a consciousness of man as part of the  | community ; and it was this new mentality that saw itself reflected in the Meyerbeer operas . Rossini , says Heine , would never have obtained his huge popularity during the Revolution of 1789 or the Empire ' ; he was emphatically the man of the Restoration epoch . The man of the new epoch that began about 183o was Meyerbeer , in whose operas people saw the characters and the problems of their own world . Heine shows how it was that Robert the Devil ' was such a stupendous success : in Robert the public saw themselves ? ' the hero who does not know precisely what it is he wants , who is in perpetual conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral uncertainties of the epoch , that vacillated so restlessly and so painfully between virtue and vice , fretted itself in endeavours and galled itself against obstacles , and , like Robert , sometimes lacked the strength to withstand the assaults of the devil . ' And again only when the great choruses of " Robert the Devil " and the " Huguenots " roared harmonically , rejoiced harmonically , sobbed harmonically , did men 's hearts hearken and sob and rejoice and roar in inspired accord . ' This , says Heine , is why Meyerbeer is the man of his epoch ; and the epoch , which always knows its own man , has tumultuously raised him on its shield , proclaimed his overlordship , and celebrates in him its own joyous entry into possession . ' Other contemporary critics say much the same thing in other words . Meyerbeer was felt to be the man of the time because his operas were peopled with figures whose psychology was then new to opera . We have seen what psychological subtleties Heine read into Robert . Chorley points out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been treated in opera . John of Leyden ( in Le Prophete ' ) , again , lover , son , fanatic , penitent ' , as Chorley describes him , was something new in a genre that had hitherto dealt mostly with stock figures or abstractions . The three Anabaptists in the Prophete ' were a novel study in religious fanaticism . " Le Prophete " , again ' , says Chorley , is peculiar as being the first serious opera relying for its principal female interest on the character of the mother . ' And so on and so on : in each of his operas Meyerbeer gave his audiences the delighted feeling that they were being brought into touch with real life , that the characters they saw on the boards were men  | and women such as they might meet any day themselves , men and women caught up in such problems of morality or politics or social life as they themselves were interested in . But in the long run , very little matters in an opera but the music . If that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most primitive character drawing : if it is poor , the best plot and the most penetrating psychology of character will not keep the work alive . Meyerbeer 's operas have perished , or live now only a half-life , because his musical gifts were not the equal of his general intelligence and culture . And in this simple fact we may perhaps read the impending doom of more than one opera of our own day that wins an immediate success by its truth to life , its contemporaneity of action and of psychology , rather than by reason of its musical excellence . He was , and is , the man of this his time , ' said A. B. Marx of Meyerbeer in 1855 . Marx then finds fault with Wagner for not being the man of his time , in that for his subjects and characters he went not to contemporary life but to saga and legend : this drama the drama of the future ? the Middle Ages a picture of our future , the already lived and outlived the child of our hopes ? Impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Holy Grail , with all their crash of honest heroes ' weapons and their conflicts of justice among the gods , strike us now as merely an echo of long-dead states of mind that are alien to our own time . ' Marx would be vastly astonished were he to return to earth today and find that the Wagnerian gods and heroes and myths and sagas are the staple fare of our opera audiences , while Robert and Raoul and Marcel and Vasco de Gama and John of Leyden and Auber 's Masaniello and most of the other operatic characters that were at one time the last word in reality ' have practically disappeared from the stage . In our own day we have seen what looked like our own day 's last word in reality , Johnny spielt auf ' , disappear from human ken in the course of a few short years . It will not be long before other mirrors of contemporary life ' , constructed by other men of the moment ' , follow that work into the limbo that awaits all operas that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND TWO SYMPHONIES : CHANGING POINTS OF VIEW 9th September 1934 IN Love Among the Chickens that profound student of human nature , Mr. P. G. Wodehouse , who is as great a philosopher as Emanuel Kant but twice as funny , poses for us one of the eternal problems of aesthetic criticism . It would be interesting to know , ' he says , to what extent the work of authors is influenced by their private affairs . If life is flowing smoothly , are the novels they write in that period of content coloured with optimism ? And if things are running crosswise , do they work off the resultant gloom on their faithful public ? If , for instance , ' continues Mr. Wodehouse , with a plunge into gloomy foreboding that is happily rare with him , if , for instance , Mr. W. W. Jacobs had toothache , would he write like Hugh Walpole ? ' I am reminded of these luminous words of the greatest living Englishman by the fact that Mozart 's E flat symphony was given at the Promenades a few days ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Thursday . As the reader may remember , Mozart 's three greatest symphonies , the E flat , the G minor , and the C major ( the Jupiter ) were all written in a few weeks between the June and the August of 1 788 . It was a time when the poor little man 's affairs were at their worst ; he was in ill-health , he was falling deeper and deeper into debt , and the future was as black as any man 's could well be ; and his letters of the period reveal the misery and despair that were eating their way into his soul . It has accordingly been one of the stock comments of the biographers that it is surprising that at a time like this he should have been able to write so gay ' a work as the symphony in E flat . The current view of the matter is expressed in a programme note a propos of last week 's performance , in which we were informed that there is no reflection in the E flat symphony of his mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything could be , and if it reflected anything at all , it was the youthful and optimistic side of the composer 's nature . '  | In that remark we meet with yet another proof of how sadly and , apparently , permanently Otto Jahn has misled the modern world as to the nature of the mind of Mozart . It is of no avail that during the last twenty years one German and French scholar after another has given us plentiful cause for believing that Jahn 's reading of Mozart was a superficial one , or that in the new edition of his classical ' work by Hermann Abert his errors have been so drastically corrected that , apart from the biographical portions , comparatively little of the original remains . Only the old Jahn has so far been translated into other languages , and so , in programme notes and elsewhere , we are still regaled with opinions about Mozart that no instructed student holds today . Jahn , Jahn , uberall Jahn ! We know rather more now about the psychology of artists than we used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive belief that if a composer has quarrelled with his wife his next symphony will be a Pathetique , or that if his liver happens to be functioning normally he will produce a Hymn to Joy at the next Three Choirs ' Festival . We know now that the creative imagination of a great artist functions too deep down within him to be greatly affected by anything that may happen on the surface of his life or his being . The subconscious is of much more importance in the artist than the conscious , and the subconscious proceeds by its own mysterious inner chemistry and obeys its own mysterious inner laws ; the result being that if his daemon feels light the man will write light music even though the bailiffs be in the room below , while if his daemon is wrestling with the problem of the informing soul of the cosmos he will write a philosophical , and perhaps a pessimistic , work even though the glad news be brought him that his wife has left him . We need not be in the least astonished , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been able to give his genius the free wing it has taken in the E flat symphony and the Jupiter : there is no need to assume that in June , when he was writing the E flat , life looked fairly bright to him , that it suddenly became so much darker that in July he simply had to write the G minor , while in August the clouds had cleared away again and , feeling less worried about Constanze and his creditors , the Jupiter followed as a natural consequence . Mozart  | the man was uniformly wretched throughout the whole of this period : the changes in the moods of the three works were due simply to changes in his aesthetic chemistry with which the experiences of his conscious mind had the minimum of connection . But the nineteenth century , with its naive psychology and its passion for sorting out the products of an artist 's mind into neat parcels , each with a different label , made a further mistake over these works . It quite overlooked the fact that while the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adagio prelude is a tragic piece of work . Jahn is so occupied with telling us that the symphony is an expression of happiness ' that he has neither eyes nor ears for this adagio : it did not fit conveniently into his neat verbal scIaematism for the three symphonies , so he blandly ignored it . Abert , on the other hand , rightly insists on the pathos ' of the adagio , its gloom ' , its uncanny ' quality , the profound pessimism ' of it as a whole . It is possible , after all , that Jahn , and others of his way of thinking , really saw nothing of all this in the adagio , that they misconceived Mozart as grossly here as they have done in so many other places ? a misunderstanding that has latterly reached its climax in the truly comic theory that Don Giovanni ' is an opera buffo . This and similar misunderstandings come mainly from the fact that early in the nineteenth century , owing to the great development of the technical resources of music under the romantics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century was lost . It has been the laborious business of the twentieth century , by stilkritische methods ( I must apologise for not being able to find a convenient English equivalent of the term ) , to bring about a better understanding of the eighteenth ? though this understanding , unfortunately , has not yet penetrated to most of our interpreters of Mozart . The reader will be able to get an idea of the principle at stake if he will consider the various ways in which the G minor symphony has been looked at during the last century and a half . For listeners of its own day it contained something that made them shudder . Gradually the feeling for the tragic intensity of it , as for that of Don Giovanni ' , was lost ; Schumann , for  | instance , took the almost incredible view of the symphony that in its light motion ' it resembled a Greek Grace ' . Even today there are conductors who regard it as a light and graceful work , and play it in exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rococo mood . Among scholars , however , it is now recognised for what it is and always was , for what its contemporaries saw it to be ? a daemonic ' work , the expression of an unrest , a bitterness , a pessimism , that has few parallels in all music . The mere fact that a conductor feels ' it to be a work of the other type is of no account whatever . Conductors as a rule are not scholars , but merely more or less sensitive musical instruments . They feel ' an ancient work in a particular way because that is the way of their own temperament , and they play it accordingly . They do not pause to ask themselves whether that way may not be a complete error , due to the unconscious substitution , in our own epoch , of quite another set of aesthetic concepts for those of a bygone age . It is the scholar , and the scholar alone , who can help us to see that old music as its composer and his contemporaries saw it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , by an examination of the theoretical speculations and the musical criticism of the epoch he can discover what the aesthetic of that epoch really was , in what a very different way from ours they looked at music , what it was they held it to be the function of music to express , the means by which they thought this expression could be achieved , and so on . In the second place , he can restore for us , to some degree , the perception the modern world has lost of language-values and idiom-values in certain old music : he can show us , for example , that , owing to the enormous development of the harmonic vocabulary during the last hundred years , certain harmonies , or certain successions of notes , no longer have for us the startling or lacerating quality they had when they were brand new . In the third place , by stilkritische methods he can show that certain typical procedures on the part of an ancient composer were invariably the outcome of certain moods in him . Armed with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G minor symphony or Don Giovanni ' , the scholar can show that the fund of feeling in the work is very much deeper and  | richer than is imagined by the average modern performer , who approaches it with no solid backing of historical musical culture , and so can do nothing more with this or any other old work than play it as he feels ' it , blissfully unsuspicious that his feeling ' , owing to the changes in the vocabulary of music between the composer 's day and now , may be the most unreliable guide imaginable to what the work meant to the composer and to those who heard it in its first freshness . It is quite possible that , even after all the Mozart research of the last twenty years or so , conductors will continue to play the G minor as if it were a Greek Grace ' , in which case there are sure to be listeners who will enjoy it in that form and innocently imagine they are listening to genuine Mozart . And if the mere scholars who happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , scholars are always bound to be in the minority where public music is concerned , and they can be conveniently written off as cranks.  | 12th June 1927 WE are given to regretting the early deaths of composers like Mozart , Schubert , Purcell and Pergolesi ; but the seemingly paradoxical proposition could be maintained that the composers who died too young were Wagner , at the age of seventy , Beethoven , at fifty-seven , Brahms , at sixty-four , and Verdi , at eighty-eight . It might be argued that there is no particular reason to suppose that any of the composers whose early deaths we lament would have gone on developing after their middle youth . There may be something in flawed physical stocks like Mozart and Pergolesi that implies , as a matter of course , early fruition and if , not early mental decay , an early mental standstill ; and I have already suggested in this column , as an interesting subject for speculation , the probable position of Mozart about 1830 had he survived Beethoven , as he could quite easily have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have stood as regards his own work in the years that saw the Eroica , the No. 5 , the No. 9 , the Mass in D , and the last piano sonatas and quartets of Beethoven ? Would he have been able to hold his own against these , to grow as Beethoven grew , to transform himself from the purest type of the eighteenth century composer to the type that alone could express the needs of the early nineteenth ; or would he have lived on to find himself superseded ? But while there is a reasonable doubt whether the minds of some of these early-deceased men would have grown greatly with length of years , there is no doubt at all as to the tremendous growth of minds like those of Wagner and Verdi : between Rienzi ' and Parsifal ' , between Nabucco ' or Ernani ' and Falstaff ' , the distance is so great that no spectator of the earliest work of these two men could have had the slightest inkling of how far they would travel before the end . And by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died too soon ; for who , after the evidence of Gianni Schicchi ' and  | Turandot ' , can doubt that his brain had the same capacity for steady growth as Verdi 's ? Most of what we heard in the crush-room during the intervals of Turandot ' last Tuesday was precisely what we should have expected to hear on an occasion of this kind . Skilled practitioners in the obvious were reminded of the Mikado ' and Chu Chin Chow ' , and quite naturally ; for is not the setting of each of these three plays in an alleged China of some sort or another , and does not the milieu , for some people , reduce everything that may be shown in it to the same common denominator ? Others shook a wise head and told us that Turandot ' was of mixed quality : specially daring and original stylists even said something about a curate 's egg . That there is something of the old Puccini along with the new is not to be wondered at ; the surprising thing would be were it otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best self even here . People who are shocked to find that now and then , after exhibiting a style to which there is no parallel in his earlier works , the Puccini of Turandot ' reminds us of the Puccini of La Boheme ' and Madame Butterfly ' , would do well to spend an hour or two in an intensive examination of the early and late work of certain other long-lived composers ? Verdi , for example . They would then discover that not only are there obvious traces of the earlier Verdian idiom in the latest works , but that Verdi all through his career kept harking back to certain formulae ; so strong is the pull of early habits upon the musical as upon the moral man , so prone is the most original mind , the mind most capable of growth , to take unconsciously the line of least resistance . The phrase to which Manrico , in Trovatore ' , sings Prima the d'altri vivere ' is virtually that to which , thirty-five years later , Otello will sing his moving Spento e quel sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of Manrico 's A chi desia , a chi desia morir ' , in the Miserere scene , is that of Aida 's O patria mia , non ti vedro mai In the Oberto ' of 1839 ( Verdi 's first opera ) will be found the essentials of Gilda 's Infelice core , cor tradito , per angoscia non scoppiare ' in the Rigoletto ' quartet of 1851 . Violetta 's cry of Amami , Alfredo , amami quant ' io t'amo ' in the Traviata ' of 1853 is plainly a reminiscence of Lida 's Ma Dio mi voile ' in  | La Battaglia di Legnano ' ( 1849 ) ; while Arrigo 's Ah no , ah no , trafitto esangue ' in the last-named opera is practically the same phrase as Manrico 's famous Ah the la morte ognora ' . An accompaniment figure in La Battaglia di Legnano ' is met with again , slightly altered , in Aida ' , as accompaniment to Amonasro 's Quest assisa ch'io vesto via dica ' . A love-motive in Un Ballo in Maschera ' ( 1859 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Other analogies could be cited by the dozen . The point in connection with them is that they are not deliberate employments , for economy 's sake , by Verdi of phrases that have already served him well , but subconscious reversions to type . It is the shallowest of criticism , then , to try to disparage Turandot ' by saying that the old Puccini is still visible here and there in the score ; as a matter of fact he has succeeded very much better in getting away from his old self here than Verdi did in getting away from his old self in Otello ' , the marvellous development of which from the Verdi of Trovatore ' is never questioned . And , like the later Verdi , when the later Puccini harks back unconsciously for a moment to his earlier idiom it is with a great spiritual difference . It may be only Violetta 's cry to Alfredo that we hear once more in Desdemona 's moving Ah , Emilia , Emilia , addio ! ' but more than thirty years of refinement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Puccini of Turandot ' reminds us of the Puccini of the earlier works it is with the same sense of change . One way of realising how vastly he had grown is by comparing his own writing in Turandot ' with Alfano 's finish to the opera . I do not know to what extent Alfano has here worked upon sketches left by Puccini , but even if some of the actual material is the latter 's how profound is the difference between the general tissue , the soul more than the body , of this last scene and Puccini 's first and second acts ! The opera suffers sadly from not having been finished by its creator : only he could have given it the spiritualised ending we feel is now lacking to it . Alfano 's contribution to the score is a clever and a conscientious piece of work ; but it has all the honest , earnest , eager crudity , not of youth ( for Alfano was fifty when he completed Turandot ' ) but of a mind that has not undergone the subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding in Puccini during his last years . Even in Gianni Schicchi ' it was evident that Puccini had purged himself of his cruder Italianism ? more thoroughly , I venture to say , than the seventy-four year old Verdi had been able to do in Otello ' . There are several melodies in this that seem to be drawn in the traditional Italian fashion with the thick of the thumb in Gianni Schicchi ' the bulk of the music is sketched with the tip of the finger , while even when Puccini seems to lapse into the conventional idiom for a time it is more probable that he is deliberately , smilingly , sporting with his own past . With what a charming grace , for instance , he hands to us Lauretta 's O mio babbino caro ' , or the Addio , speranza bella ' ! It is as if he were saying to us , This that you and I used to take so seriously was after all only a game we put the whole of ourselves into when we were young and a little foolish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , to play it again , what about this for a move ? ' and he pushes a pawn across the board with such an air that it counts as a bishop at the least . And in Turandot ' , whenever he uses the former apparatus it is to other ends than of old and with another grace and power . That he is still dogged by his past , as every artist is , goes without saying ; and in addition he has certain peculiarly difficult problems of expression to solve . He had already had to struggle with them in Madame Butterfly ' . In the greater part of that work he maintains quite easily the exotic atmosphere ; but when he comes to write the love duet at the end of the first act , his little Japanese lady becomes the ordinary amoureuse of Italian opera ; and in Turandot ' also we feel that when he has to express one of the stronger primary emotions he has to revert to the traditional idiom of his own country and period . But even here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison with the old Puccini , while the great bulk of the score is a marvel of new ideas and new technique . It is useless to try to get any real idea of the opera from the piano arrangement , so organically is the harmonic tissue interwrought with the orchestral colour : things that are meaningless or repellent on the piano are found to be perfectly right when we hear them in the theatre .  | I should say that the first and second acts of Turandot ' are the very finest Puccini ? even more his Falstaff ' than his Otello ' . Over the first act there broods a peculiar fatefulness : we shall have to hear it a good many times to get to the technical secret of this miracle of homogeneity . In certain passages , such as the writing in general for Ping , Pang and Pong , the three Court functionaries , the technical advance upon the earlier Puccini must be obvious to the most casual listener ; but there are numberless things below the surface here that intrigue the sensitive musician .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a few days ago , is practically unknown in this country , apart from the Musical Box ' that forms one of the movements of his pianoforte suite En Vacances ' and his Baigneuses au Soleil ' , which has a certain technical attraction for pianists . My own acquaintance with de Severac 's music began some years ago as a result of reading one or two French articles on him in which he was hailed as one of the most significant representatives of what is more or less vaguely known as the French spirit . I myself could see little in him that was representative of anything but the type of amateur composer that is as plentiful as berries in every country , but I was prepared to believe that this view of him came from some defect in myself and that the true light would dawn on me later . In the ensuing years I read other articles on him , in which he was again treated as a French composer of distinction ; and as some of the French writers who saw talent in him saw nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became still more puzzled . Since his death I have read again through all the music of his that I possess . I can again see nothing more in him than the honest amateur . I do not know all his work , and it may be that I have not met with the best of it . I see from the catalogues and the obituary notices that he wrote two operas and various symphonic works ; but whether these are accessible or not I can not say . Anyhow , in all the articles on him that I have seen he has always been treated as a minor master in virtue of his piano works . I know , I think , all of these that have been published , including the Sous les lauriers roses ' that was issued only last year , and I know also most of his songs . His was seemingly a small output for a man of forty-eight . That of itself is significant .  | You can tell the big man , as Tennyson used to say , not only by the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion I can come to , when I read the French eulogies upon de Severac , is that it is easier to be a composer in France at present than in any other country in the world . No matter how small your work , in size , in scope , or in importance , you will be welcomed and feted by some circle or other . French music has become very conscious of itself during the last generation , largely as a process of reaction against the domination of German music . The natural corollary to the proposition that no good French composer would write like a German was that any Frenchman who did not write like a German was a good composer . On the strength of this , a number of composers who have really no claim whatever to distinction have been treated by some critics with excessive consideration . Some French musical criticism has a curious way of ceasing to be critical when the products of its own nation are concerned . I can recall articles in which de Severac was discussed at great length , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Languedoc . One of the most amusing features of the theory of a national ' spirit in music is that it always splits up , in practice , into the doctrine of a number of regional spirits . In one breath we are told that certain Russian composers are nationalistic ' ; in the next , that there is as much difference between the Little Russian and the Great Russian as between the Cockney and the Tyke . Albeniz and Granados are both national ' Spanish composers ; and then we learn that they represent two different physiological and psychological and cultural Spanish types . We have not got as far as this in England yet . We do not ask of a composer that he shall express in his songs the soul of the Five Towns in which he was brought up , nor of another that the authentic voice of the Glasgow shipyards shall be heard in his chamber music . But in France the distinctions between the various regions of the country , and the way in which these distinctions are expressed in the art of this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of these regions , are insisted upon with much gravity by some critics . Languedoc obviously had to have a composer of its own ; and as de Severac was born  | there , his music must obviously be full of a spirit to be found in Languedoc and nowhere else . Add to this fact the further fact that one or two French critics have the enviable faculty of being immensely pleased with very little , and you have all the ingredients for making a significant composer out of an insignificant one . These critics ? we have one or two of the same sort among our own countrymen , by the way ? find what is to most of us a daily trudge a delightful pilgrimage among masterpieces . A new talent flowers on every bush ; every shilling they pick up has , for them , the gilding of the sovereign ; and they see one of the supreme masters of Gothic in the designer of the parish pump . So it comes about that a mere amateur like de Severac becomes , for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amateur ? Not necessarily one who has had no technical training . De Severac went through the mill , I believe , as thoroughly as any other young man . But there are people who are born amateurs , and no amount of training can make anything else of them . Glinka was of this type . De Severac was another ; and he is representative of thousands of people of today who insist on composing . They mistake an aspiration towards composition for a gift for it and a call to it . A musical technique is not something that can be acquired in schools or out of a book ? a sort of costume for the better display of an idea . It must be inherent in the ideas themselves , or it is nothing at all . A really vital idea makes its own technique . The free working of the technique in turn stimulates and liberates ideas . We might as well try to make an Italian poet of a non-poetically minded man by teaching him Italian as to make a musical technician of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by teaching him harmony and counterpoint and form and all the rest of it . We can always tell the born amateur , no matter how much academic tuition he has had . His ideas , in the first place , lack vitality . Ideas ' in themselves are next to nothing . Any man of ordinary artistic feeling , in the course of an hour 's walk , may get ideas ' enough for half-a-dozen sonnets or symphonies or novels or pictures or articles . What really matters is the indefinable thing we call treatment ' , handling ' , style ' .  | I do not mean that there are not degrees of excellence even among ideas . Obviously , the idea of the first phrase of Schubert 's Serenade ' is better than the idea of the first phrase of Ethelbert Nevin 's The Rosary ' . But many amateurs are visited by ideas that are excellent in themselves , but that come to nothing , like a rare bird 's egg laid in a dustbin ; while an idea that may seem at first sight to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eroica ' symphony , may become the foundation stone of an edifice that is one of the world 's wonders . Vitality ' , in regard to musical ideas , is a very complex concept . 24th April 192I I SAID in my previous articles that there are some composers who are born amateurs , and amateurs they will remain to the end of their days , no matter how much practice they may get in their art . They may write a fair amount of quite good music ; but the distinction between them and the real composers will always be unmistakable . It is the eternal distinction between even the very best of amateurs and the less than very best of professionals . The amateur champions among the billiard players and boxers , for instance , are not quite in the class of the second string of the professional practitioners of those sports . Amongst the amateurs in music I should class Glinka , de Severac , Meyerbeer , and Leoncavallo . There are degrees , of course , among amateurs ; and now and then the best work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the amateurishness keeps betraying itself . In which way ? the reader may ask . In various ways . One sign of the born amateur is that he can not sustain his thinking at its best for very long . He can write a fine page ; but he can not write a fine work ? at least , not one of any length . Nor can he write many really fine works in the smallest forms . I would instance , as a typical amateur , one Fritz Koegel , an unknown German whose songs came into my hands a few years ago when I was making a systematic study of the German song . Three or four of Koegel 's songs are both beautiful in idea and admirably worked out ; but in the majority of them the often excellent  | ideas come to much less than they ought to have done , simply because the technique is inadequate . By technique , needless to say , I do not mean the formulae of composition taught in the schools and the text-books , but that way of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility of expression that not only allows him to say all he wants to say , but is itself a perpetual stimulus to the imagination . It is in this constant action and interaction of imagination and technique that the amateur composer fails ; the result is invariably an impression of helplessness somewhere or other . Everyone knows Meyerbeer 's difficulty in ending a phrase as finely as he began it ; one illustration of this has become classic ? the baritone aria in Dinorah ' , with its excellent first and third lines and its lamentable second and quite abject fourth . Leoncavallo had something of the same difficulty in finishing well ; plenty of instances could be quoted from I Pagliacci ' . De Severac exhibits all the marks of the amateur . He invariably does his best work ( it is never of much account , I think ) in the small forms in which all he has to do is to fill a conventional mould with a standardised paste , to which he gives just a touch of colouring of his own . To this order belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says nothing that has not been said a hundred thousand times before , but the voice has its own timbre . To a certain extent , again , he can exploit the standardised formulae of realistic imitation ( horses galloping , etc. ) or of subjective expression ( religious feeling , and so on ) ; but invariably the amateur is betrayed before he has got past the first page or two . A correspondent who , while not ranking de Severac 's music as a whole very high , thinks more of it than I do , and demurs to my general characterisation of him , tells me he regards the Coin de cimitiere au printemps ' and Sur 1'etang , le soir ' ( from the suite En Languedoc ' ) as two of the most poetic works of modern piano music ' . I am sorry I can not agree . They are poetic enough in intention , but the intentions are mostly not realised . As I pointed out before , good ideas are as common as blackberries : any of us can turn them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The test comes when the ideas have to be developed . Again let me explain that by development ' I do not mean the  | formal procedure taught in the books and the conservatoires under that rubric ; I mean the process by which the idea opens out and moves along , impelled by an inner , inexplicable , irresistible logic of its own . It is here that the amateur fails . He will often hit upon something that might not have occurred to a much greater composer ; perhaps the first example of the use of the whole-tone scale is that curious passage in Glinka 's Russian and Ludmilla ' . But the amateur 's imagination lacks the driving logic essential to the expansion of the idea . We may call it a failure of technique if we like ; but the root of the trouble is in the quality and vitality of the imagination . I myself would cite Coin de cimitiere , au printemps ' , as a typical example of de Severac 's amateurishness . He does , at the beginning , just what any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase that suggests a mood or an atmosphere . But he can get no further with it ; for all practical purposes , he has said all he has to say in the first twelve bars . In the remainder I can see nothing but the helplessness of the amateur . He has no device , in fact , for lengthening a work except repetition . There is no evolution of an idea ? merely repetitions of it with new piano figuration , generally of the most infantine kind . If I were teaching composition I should hold up page after page of de Severac to the student as a warning . He rarely gets beyond the exercise stage . If some of these works were shown me as extracts from the exercise book of a conservatoire student , I should regard them as fairly promising studies in the rudiments of composition technique . But , if , several years later , a new set of books were shown me , containing nothing but the same conventional formulae , handled in the same inelastic way , I should be compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I say that of de Severac after studying piano works of his extending over some twenty years . His technique was as rudimentary at the end as at the beginning . He never even added to his original slender stock of devices . Of anything like a sense of design he was utterly innocent . He can build up a long work only by piecing together and repeating a number of fragments having no more connection with each other than the patches in  | a crazy quilt have . One of his latest works , Sous les lauriers roses ' ( 1920 ) , that runs to twenty-seven pages , is perfectly childish in its scrappiness . He would hardly be worth considering in and by himself , but some of the French eulogies upon him do at least help us to take our bearings in modern music and modern criticism . When we see mighty architects and builders like Brahms and Beethoven being gibed at , and then see the sort of music that satisfies their detractors ? well , we begin to put two and two together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a quart into a pint pot . What is the use of our talking about St. Paul 's or Chartres to the little fellow over there with the tiny spade and bucket who is admiring the sand castle he has just managed to construct ? We must wait till he grows up before we begin to discuss architecture with him .  | 25th November 1923 THANKS to the admirable Federation of Music Clubs , London music lovers have had , during the week , three opportunities of hearing Schonberg 's Pierrot Lunaire ' ? so long a bone of contention on the Continent ? on Monday evening at Kensington , on Tuesday afternoon at Westminster , and on Wednesday at Chelsea . I do not know whether any one took all three chances ? or shall I say risks ? Some of my colleagues were content with one performance . A few of the Dreadnoughts among us braved two ; but when we asked each other whether we were going to the third , we all with one accord began to make excuse , saying , I am engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be too unwell to listen to any music , especially Schonberg 's . ' This latter was no idle fear , it seems , for one colleague whom I saw on Wednesday assured me that after attending Monday 's performance he had suffered all Tuesday from a distressing , though fortunately not dangerous , internal complaint that confined him to the house . He could not attribute this positively to Pierrot Lunaire ' , but he thought the sequence of events not without significance . The reader who does not know the work may like to know that it is a setting of twenty-one short poems ( translated from the French of Albert Giraud ) for a solo voice and a small chamber orchestra consisting of piano , flute ( interchanging with piccolo ) , clarinet ( interchanging with bass clarinet ) , violin ( interchanging with viola ) , and ' cello . The players at these performances ( Jean Wiener , Louis Fleury , H. Delacroix , H. Denayer , and Paul Mas ) were said to have rehearsed the work r 10 times , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in quite good health . Darius Milhaud conducted , with a touching blend of solemnity and anxiety . The poems were spoken ( in French , much to the annoyance of those of us who had learned them in the German , so as to have every ounce of our cerebral energy free to follow the music ) , by Madame Marya Freund .  | Schonberg writes definite notes for the voice in his score , but he specifies for the vocalist a method of delivery half-way between song and speech . I found this method not merely an annoyance but a strain . It is bad enough , we all know , to have to take in instrumental music and pure speech simultaneously ; but that is a simple proposition compared with the one Schonberg sets for our ear and our brain . I thought Madame Freund often got , in spite of herself , much nearer to pure singing than Schonberg would have approved of : but I can not dogmatise on that point . What is certain is that of all the forms of torture devised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cruellest ; to myself , at any rate , it was a perpetual misery to be unable to fix the voice as either a pure singing or a pure speaking instrument . The method , too , becomes unbearably monotonous after a while . The performance was a triumph for Madame Freund , who sang from memory . I shudder at the work it must have cost her to attain such accuracy of pitch and time . At the first performance I followed with the score . The singer and the players were not invariably on the same beat at the same moment , but the divergences were few ; the marvel was that the timing should have been so generally accurate , considering the zig-zag nature of the writing . I can not imagine anyone who has heard the work two or three times ever wanting to hear it again ; I certainly do not . Nothing more needlessly ugly and at the same time so pointless has ever been heard in London ; and I doubt whether , on this occasion , we shall be solemnly warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , of the danger of hastily despising a work that may be acclaimed as a masterpiece by the next generation . We are all quite willing to run that risk . In the first place , there has never yet , in the whole history of music , been a composer of any value who was not recognised as such by his own generation ; and it is hardly likely that Nature has gone out of her way to make an exception in the case of the later Schonberg . ( The earlier Schonberg really could write music . ) In the second place , this is not a case of our being bowled over by a startlingly new style . Schonberg 's scores have been published long enough for us to get to know them as well as we know Franck 's or  | Strauss 's . I myself have read through the Pierrot Lunaire ' many times ; indeed , to be able to submit it to the great test of music ? running it through one 's mind on one 's walks ? I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all this trouble the music seems to me as ugly and empty as it did at first . However the Schonbergian pur sang may try to account for our poor opinion of the Pierrot Lunaire ' , he can not do so by charging us with lack of familiarity with it . The Schonbergians , indeed , are hard put to it to justify their own mild enthusiasm for the work . Singularly few of them will commit themselves to a point-blank declaration that they think it good music ; and the one or two who do can not tell us precisely why they think so . What they have to say in praise of it is mostly irrelevant ; they tell us not what the music does , but what it sets out to do ? which is quite a different matter . We are told that it is meant to be a satire on the romantic spirit . If so , the satire is a very poor one . If you want to kill a thing by laughing at it , your laugh must show a quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it merely by taking your own super-dullness with preposterous seriousness . Not only is the derision of Giraud and Schonberg a trifle dullwitted ? especially Schonberg 's ? but it is hopelessly stale and conventional . For the true antique commend me to your upto-date young man : there is not a slogan in his repertory that has not been staled by centuries of use by his innocent like . In one of these Giraud poems Pierrot shows his fine contempt for the romantic by turning a skull into a pipe-bowl and smoking through it . A very dashing little fellow , evidently ; but how unoriginal ! To go no further back than a century ago , the young Romantics ( see , especially , the letters of Berlioz and a picture by Delacroix in the Louvre ) were showing their contempt for bourgeois notions of life by treating the human skull with a familiarity bordering on disrespect . And it is the dabblers in these weary old cliches who ask us to take them as the last word in cynical satire ! Nor is it any use telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing is easier than to do something new in music ; the difficulty is to be at once new and interesting . Write , if you like ? as in the seventh of these songs  | for a voice accompanied by a flute alone ; but at least write a better line for the flute than Schonberg does . Do not imagine , again , that if only you use harmonies that have never been used before you are absolved from the old necessity of making your harmonies talk sense . You may say , of course , that your harmonic thinking is so far in advance of ours that our poor intelligences can not follow you . The proper recipients for that story are the marines : there has never yet been a composer whose harmonic sense was so far in advance of his time that only two or three people in Europe in his own day could see what he was driving at ; and , as I have hinted , it is hardly likely that Nature has conferred that unprecedented distinction on you . Let me risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one after that , by saying outright that Pierrot Lunaire ' is the music not of a genius but of a brain that has lost every vestige of the musical faculty it once had except the power to put notes together without the smallest concern for whether they mean anything or not .  | SCHUBERT : A POINT IN THE UNFINISHED ' 2nd February 1941 1 SEE a number of performances of Schubert 's Unfinished ' announced in various parts of the country ; and I have no doubt that wherever the work is given enthusiasts are still discussing the old question of the switch-over from the first-subject matter to the second in the opening movement . The reader who has not a score handy may like to be reminded that Schubert 's exposition of his first theme , or congeries of themes , is in B minor , and occupies thirty-eight bars . By the forty-second bar he is right into his second subject , the cantabile melody in the ' cellos in G major . That is to say , he takes us out of one world into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three consist of a single long-held note , so that the actual change-over is effected in one bar of modulation from the old key to the new : There is a school of thought that regards this as an evasion of the symphonist 's crucial problem of how to move convincingly from one main section of his structure to another . These changes , it is contended , ought to be more gradual , not a mere matter , as is alleged to be the case in this instance , of two sharply contrasted themes being hitched up together by hook or by crook . I have never been able to agree with this point of view regarding the join in the Unfinished . It has its origin , I think , in a tenet of the nineteenth century to which Wagner gave expression in a letter a propos of the second act of Tristan ' , in which he says that the art of composition is really the art of imperceptible transition . The eighteenth century bothered little about this ; broadly speaking , when Mozart has handed us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns round and reaches out to the sideboard for the plate containing  | the second theme , keeping our attention occupied , during the few seconds the substitution of the one for the other takes him , with a conventional chord or two that have no other purpose than to inform the diners that the first course is over and the second will follow immediately . Beethoven took his transitions more seriously . So did Brahms , though his joins are often no more than skilled padding without any true organic life in it . Is there any reason , we may surely ask , why a mind that does not work at all like Beethoven 's should try to reproduce the Beethovenian manner of transition ? Schubert 's genius was far more naive than reflective . He seems to have racked his brains hardly at all over problems of structure , trusting to his inexhaustible invention to see him through anything . Now and then , as in the slap-dash first movements of some of his feebler piano sonatas , he lands himself in real difficulties through this habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all thought out the connection of the parts to the very end . In his chamber music , as a rule , he makes no attempt at all to link up one thematic group with another by means of ' development ' : he just goes straight on , achieving , however , in his own peculiar way an inner logic that is perfectly convincing . It is when he is in a more or less dramatic mood that he feels the necessity for building some sort of bridge that will at once mark off from each other and connect two contrasting emotional worlds . He does this in the most obviously purposeful and pointed fashion in the transition from the first to the second subject of the Rosamund ' overture . But always on occasions of this kind his procedure is essentially the same ? not to fumble about in the Brahmsian manner but to go straight to the point , poising the music for a while on a note or chord that is related to both the old key and the new , and then making a swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the reader will compare the musical example already quoted with the join of the two main subjects in the Rosamund ' , or again with the corresponding transitional passage in the great C major symphony : deciese.  | he will see at a glance that the procedure is basically the same in all three cases ; and I , for my part , can conceive no possible criticism of the transition in the Unfinished that would not apply in precisely the same degree to that in the C major . This , in fact , was Schubert 's way of going about things , and it was the way most organically related to the nature of the characteristically Schubertian ideas . In the first movement of the Unfinished the determining factor at the critical point we are considering is not the melody of the first subject per se , but the sombre mood generated by a succession of dissonances of this type : It is these that create that feeling of increasing tension in the exposition of the first subject , and the desire for relief from this tension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a mere compositorial device but an irresistible necessity . It is this inevitableness in the spiritual sequences of the movement that make it the great thing it is ; and I personally could wish for no better transition to the lovely second theme than the temporary poise , followed by the simple modulation , shown in No. z . Both emotionally and structurally Schubert 's join does all that is required of it , and does it in the minimum of time and without a trace of bookishness or self-consciousness .  | TWO SYMPHONIES 28th March 1920 AT a rehearsal of Sibelius 's Fourth Symphony some years ago I was approached by a man who asked if he might look over my score . Of course I was delighted . After a few minutes of the music , the man turned to me and remarked tentatively : Queer stoof , eh ? ' I replied that perhaps it was not easy to take in music of this sort at a first hearing ? that it came from a different civilisation from ours , and that without a little imaginative insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation it was hardly possible to understand all that a typical representative of that nation was driving at in his art . As my visitor still seemed a little puzzled I added : You see , this music comes from Finland . ' His face brightened at once ; he had the key to the enigma . Ah ! ' he said , that 's it ; aw coom from Halifax . ' I remarked that Halifax was a very long way from Finland , and we left it at that . I was reminded of this experience the other afternoon at the Queen 's Hall . Sir Henry Wood and I seemed to be a minority of two in the voting upon the Fourth Symphony . It appears to have bored everyone else with whom I have discussed it . I console myself with the reflection that they all probably come from Halifax , either by train or by ancestry . Whether I like the work in the sense that I like the Boutique Fantasque ' , or the Siegfried Idyll ' , or tobacco , I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no arguing about taste , so I will not try to convince people to whom the characteristic gloom of Sibelius is temperamentally abhorrent . I can only say that this particular brand of gloom appeals to me . Sibelius 's spectacles are not mine , any more than Tchaikovsky 's are ; but I have no objection to looking through them now and then for half-an-hour . The pessimist has as much right to exist and express himself as the cheerful idiot has . The only thing we in our turn have a right to ask of him is that he shall talk so persuasively that for the moment he  | really convinces us that the world is going to the demnition bowwows ; and Sibelius , for me at any rate , does this . I greatly prefer his black-browed snubbing of Ormuzd to Tchaikovsky 's hysterical appeal to Ahriman not to hurt him so much . But if other people are merely bored by the gloom of dense sunless forests I can not say them nay . I would ask them , however , to take a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We often say of a work of art that we admire that it does not contain a superfluous note , or word , or line , as the case may be . This symphony of Sibelius 's is one of the few works on a large scale of which that is literally true . He has left out more notes than most other composers would have put in ; the symphony has always reminded me of one of those drawings in which every line , or every portion of a line , that was not absolutely essential to the suggestion of a form has been rubbed out . The eye easily accommodates itself to this economy in the plastic arts , for there is the memory of the thing seen to help out the artist 's curt suggestion of it . A non-representative art like music , however , adopts this method of compression at its peril . Yet a moment 's reflection will show that music , like drawing and like literature , can , in the hands of a composer who knows what he is about , with impunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . Harmony , let us remember , has progressed by composers telescoping chordal progressions , as it were ? that is to say , by anticipating part of the coming chord in the present one , thus making new harmonies . One reason of the obscurity of the later Schonberg is that he telescopes too swiftly , too drastically for us : he may see the logical connection between two adjacent chords , but we can not ; he has cut out too many of the transitions that make things easy for us . People who are used to travelling comfortably , even if a little roundabout , by the high roads are apt to get lost when they have to make their way straight across country . Nevertheless , the original harmonists are always taking us by shorter and shorter paths ; and there are minds here and there that are similarly bent on telescoping the forms of music . Sibelius is oRe of them ; and the new method has never been  | so successfully followed as in this Fourth Symphony . He disdains transition for transition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders of some prehistoric walls or buildings may have laid stone upon stone , without mortar between them . But we have grown so used to mortar in music that without it the structure makes too many demands upon the speed of accommodation of the average ear . Music like this seems to have no softening atmosphere about it , no aerial perspective ; every theme springs abruptly out of the earth and challenges the ear to take it in at once and adjust it to its fellows ; and everything seems to be in the foreground , all in the one plane . For my part I like the stark strength and prehistoric roughness of the style ; but it will evidently take some time for the general music-lover to feel at home in it . The other extreme of style may be seen in the great Second Symphony of Elgar , of which Mr. Adrian Boult gave so fine a performance on Tuesday ; in all Elgar 's later music on the big scale , indeed ? the two symphonies , the quartet , and the quintet . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , to cover every kind of work for several instruments that lasts for halfan-hour or so that we are apt to forget the many differences of species there may be and are within the same genus . The textbooks still go on with their innocent prattle about sonata form ' , and the guileless student imagines that it is in this ancient form that all symphonies are written . Elgar 's symphonies , however , have about as much to do with sonata form in the Conservatoire sense of the term as the nervous system of a highly organised human being has with the skeleton of the chimpanzee . But this point can not be adequately elaborated here . I must reserve it for another article .  | MOST PERSONAL OF GREAT COMPOSERS 1st October 1933 WE need not be surprised that Sibelius , at the age of sixty-eight , and with considerably more than a hundred opus numbers to his credit , is still comparatively little known . In matters of this kind we must learn to think not in years but in generations , our public musical life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man know , for instance , of the work of Berlioz , who died sixtyfour years ago ? I happened the other day to come across a complaint by a German writer that singers seemed to know next to nothing of Hugo Wolf 's songs but Verborgenheit ' and Gesang Weylas ' . That was in 1909 ; and in 1933 things are not very much better in this respect . If people would only learn to read music for themselves , whether they can play an instrument or not , there would be a different story to tell . As it is , they are dependent for their knowledge of music upon performers ; and the average performer is considerably less of an artist than of a business man who wants to make the maximum of money with the minimum of trouble . Only the other day I heard of a star violinist who positively refused to learn either the Sibelius or the Elgar violin concerto ; why , indeed , from his point of view , should he trouble to do so , when he knows he can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pockets of the gullible public by means of the Mendelssohn , Brahms , Bruch , and Tchaikovsky concertos , plus a score or so of favourite trifles ? And even when conductors , fiddlers , pianists , singers , and so on do take courage and now and then bring forward an unfamiliar work , the result , as often as not , is to make those who already know the work wish they had kept their hands off it , a subject upon which I shall have something to say in another article . Even supposing that all performances of Sibelius were ideal , so that our audiences really heard what they thought they were  | hearing , and liked the works and encouraged concert promoters to give them again , it would still , at our past and present rate of progress , take something like three hundred years for the public to become acquainted with the whole Sibelius . Few people realise how many different aspects his work presents . The Finnish ' Sibelius , the exploiter of an idiom that is vaguely supposed to be national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total Sibelius , as anyone will discover if he takes up a few representative works in certain of the other genres cultivated by the composer ? the songs , the chamber music , the concerted music , the choral music , the incidental music to plays , and so on . The string quartet , for instance , or the violin concerto that was given at the Promenades this week , presents us with a Sibelius very different from the Sibelius of the popular conception , derived mainly as this is from Finlandia ' , the Valse Triste ' , En Saga ' , The Swan of Tuonela ' , the Karelia Suite ' , and works of that kind . Little that is written upon composers by their contemporaries turns out to be of any ultimate value ? a sobering reflection for us critics , but one from which a study of the musical criticism of the past leaves us no escape , for even the contemporary critics who were best-disposed towards a Wagner or a Berlioz or a Brahms , for example , have really contributed very little towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much too close to Sibelius , and have had too little time to let the bulk of his music settle deep within us and throw out its own basic lines of contact with our conception of the main stream of musical history , for us to be able to attempt anything like a picture of him as the generation of Ig6o or that of 2000 will see him . His many-sidedness is of itself a little puzzling to us ; we find it far from easy to bring into the one focus works so disparate as the national ' pieces , the earlier symphonic poems , the string quartet , and the violin concerto on the one hand , and the later symphonies and Tapiola ' on the other . The violin concerto , for instance , contains a great deal that , if the work stood alone , would prompt us to rank the composer of it among the cpigones of German romanticism . The lovely slow movement in particular carries a step further the kind of expression we get in  | the greater Schumann ? the Schumann of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manfred ' , and the ' Faust ' ; while one of the themes in the finale , oddly enough , is not only almost note for note identical with the main theme of Wagner 's Faust Overture ' , but suggests a good deal of the type of mid-nineteenth century romanticism of which this overture and the Faust Symphony ' of Liszt are the finest expressions . Many another work of Sibelius besides the concerto gives us the feeling that with the slightest of turns of fortune 's wheel he might have pursued quite another development than the one we have come to associate with him . For it must be remembered that the concerto and the string quartet are not early works , representing a mental phase , derived from the music of his predecessors , that Sibelius was soon to abandon for the role of a national ' composer , but works of his middle period , that follow upon works in what we would now call the more definitely Sibelian style . The concerto ( 1903 ) , for instance , is later than the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1892 ) , Karelia ' ( 1893 ) , and Finlandia ' ( 1899 ) , while the quartet ( 1909 ) follows upon these works , Pohjola 's Daughter ' , and the third symphony ( 19o8 ) . Many of the songs of this middle period , too , are in a vein that it is quite impossible to associate with the Finnish ' Sibelius . But there seems to have been an instinct in him that drove him imperiously before it into a field that is wholly his own , bringing him to a music that is neither romantic , nor national ' , nor anything else to which one of the conventional labels can be attached , but purely and simply Sibelius . From the first , even when he was working in an idiom that others had cultivated before him , he had a note decidedly his own ; and in the great works of his maturity he reveals himself as the most personal , the least derivative , of all the great composers . The only one he can be compared to in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be without ancestors and without posterity . But we are discovering now that Berlioz owed more to some of his predecessors than was at one time thought : the line of connection has been obscured because , while Beethoven , Brahms , Wagner , Strauss and others derived from composers whose works are familiar to everyone , the composers to whom  | Berlioz was in some degree indebted are now completely unknown except to a few students of the byways of musical history . Sibelius , in his latest and greatest works , reminds us of nobody . Gradually , out of the mixture of influences to which he was subject in his earlier and middle years , there emerged a musical personality that is completely and solely itself both as a whole and in detail . An urgent instinct to economy in him first of all drove him to dispense with the formal beginnings and endings upon which most composers have had to rely . A study of his songs is very instructive in this respect ; they plunge into their subject without preamble , and having said what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional fringe behind them as they leave the stage . The dividing line in his career ? a line none the less definite because of an occasional dip to this side or that of it ? is the remarkable fourth symphony , a work of a laconicism that is at first disconcerting . No other music that has ever been written is so spare of build as this : it is an athlete 's body , without an ounce of superfluous flesh upon it , with most of the weight in the bones and with the muscles all tension and power . From that point onwards his best musical thinking has tended more and more towards drastic concision : the culmination of it all has been Tapiola ' , in which a work lasting some fifteen minutes has been constructed virtually from first to last out of a single germ-idea , and the seventh symphony , in which the music follows a logical development of its own without the smallest reliance on the standardised structural devices of the ordinary symphony : we do not know why this or that thematic fragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know at the finish is that it could not have been otherwise , that the work is not only extraordinarily expressive but formally one and indivisible . And the peculiar thematic weaving is matched with a style of orchestration that complies with the definition of the highest style in any field of literature or art ? it is not something applied from the outside , but something pertaining only to those particular ideas , so that it is impossible to say which is the idea and which its clothing . I remember Sibelius astonishing me , some thirty years ago , by saying that a certain composer who is rightly regarded as ,  | in the current phrase , a master of instrumentation ' , was really only a thinker in terms of the piano . I found it difficult to agree with him then ; but after Tapiola ' and the seventh symphony I see better what he meant . He himself is the pure type of the composer who does not simply orchestrate ' but thinks in terms of the orchestra as a natural language of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of his would be a pure absurdity .  | THE FALLACY OF PURE ' MUSIC 3oth December 1934 IN an interesting article in the Daily Telegraph the other day , Mr. Walter Legge gave us the substance of some recent conversations he has had with Sibelius . According to the latter , since Beethoven 's time all the so-called symphonies , except Brahms 's , have been symphonic poems . In many cases the composers have told us , or at least indicated , the programmes they had in mind ; in others it is plain that there has been some story or landscape or set of images that the composer has set himself to illustrate . That is not my idea of a symphony . My symphonies are music conceived and worked out in terms of music and with no literary basis . I am not a literary musician ; for me music begins where words cease .... A symphony should be first and last music . Of course it has happened that , quite unbidden , some mental image has established itself in my mind in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fertilisation of my symphonies have been solely musical . When I set out to write symphonic poems it is a different matter . " Tapiola " , " Pohjola 's Daughter " , " Lemminkalnen " , " The Swan of Tuonela " , are suggested to me by our national poetry , but I do not pretend that they are symphonies . ' All this , admirable as it is in some ways , seems to me to be based on an aesthetic misconception that is so common that it is worth while examining it for a moment . Amateurs in musical aesthetic are fond of talking about what they call pure ' music , by which they mean , if they mean anything at all , music that simply weaves notes into patterns for the notes ' sake and the pattern 's sake . The other kind of music is motived by , or in some way associated with , ideas and emotions derived from the outer world ? from poetry , scenery , stories , characters , and so on . Now since the antithesis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impure music : and that being so , we reach the saddening conclusion that all the  | greatest composers the world has ever known have been monsters of artistic impurity . For without exception they have not only dipped their hands in these unclean waters but bathed , nay wallowed , in them : Monteverdi when he sets the story of Orpheus to music , Mozart when he lets the shape , the colour , the expression of his music be determined by the literary image he had formed of a Don Giovanni or an Osmin , Beethoven when he takes as his musical starting-point a Florestan , a Pizarro , or the verbal images suggested by the words of the Mass , Brahms when he sets out to find a musical equivalent for the words of his German Requiem , are as guilty of the same supposed descent into the unclean as Liszt when he writes an Orpheus ' , Strauss when he writes a Till Eulenspiegel ' , Elgar when he writes a Falstaff ' ' , Debussy when he sets the sea at different times of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us the planets . To be strictly logical , we ought to write off nineteentwentieths of the best music in the world as impure , for it is literary or pictorial music . The amount of pure ' music in the world is extremely small . Music of this kind is typified by the first of Bach 's Twelve Little Preludes ' , or , on a larger scale , by one of the rapid movements of a Brandenburg Concerto . Our delight here is purely and simply in the way the notes go and the symmetrical patterns they weave . Music of this kind resembles a kitten chasing its own tail ? a charming spectacle , but not the conceivably highest of intellectual functions . If we are going to frown upon the symphonic poem and the programme symphony , we must also frown upon the opera , the oratorio , the cantata , and the song , for the difference between these and the other two are superficial , not basic . Ein Heldenleben ' and Don Juan ' are operas without words : the Ring ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelleas and Melisande ' becomes an opera in the hands of Debussy and a symphonic poem in the hands of Schonberg : and so ad infinitum . It will be said , however , that in the case of a symphony pure and simple the composer , as Sibelius implies , lets his musical faculty function in a different way from what it does in the symphonic poem . To some extent that is true ; but even that proposition is not quite so simple as it looks .  | On the one hand , only a bad composer makes his symphonic poem ( or his song ) a mere point-to-point illustration of episodes or verbal ideas . When Sibelius says that his symphonies are music conceived and worked out in terms of music , he forgets , if I may say so , that even in a symphonic poem or a song of the best kind the composer 's mind functions in much the same way . A genuine musician 's nature is too musical for him to think organically in any other terms but those of music , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be turned . Very often the subject is something added later , some external irritant , as it were , that merely crystallises an emotion that is already at work inside the composer . Strauss has told us , a propos of his own songs , that one evening he will be turning the leaves of a volume of poetry : a poem will strike his eye , he reads it through , and at once the appropriate music is instinctively fitted to it . He is in a musical frame of mind , and all he wants is the right poetic vessel into which to pour his ideas . If good luck throws this in his way , a satisfactory song results . But often the poem that presents itself is not the right one ; then he has to bend his musical mood to fit it the best way it can ; he works laboriously and without the right kind of enthusiasm at it . The song , in fact , is made , not born . ' In other words , a good song is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music that exists in virtue of its own nature , the poet 's idea being caught up into the very being of music and reconstituted as music . Wagner , who was the clearest thinker among all the great composers on the subject of musical aesthetic , has expressly laid it down that a composer must not rush to set his ideas down on paper the moment he has been stirred by some experience , whether from books or from actual life . He must wait until the germ thus sown has had time to develop within him according to the unconscious laws of music ; and then , when he sits down to compose his work , though it may bear a literary title such as Faust ' or Hamlet ' , it will be music shaping itself and evolving not as literature or a picture but as music . The man who imagines that Wagner first of all wrote texts and then set himself to find equivalents in sound for them merely exhibits the grossest ignorance of his subject : Wagner himself tells us , more  | than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously within him ; in the very act of conceiving the words of an opera he was also conceiving , in essence , the music , and a subconscious musical plan was all the time dictating to him the substance and the form of his poem . We thus arrive at the very position Sibelius takes up in defence of his own symphonies . It will be objected , no doubt , that I am not doing justice to his distinction between his symphonic poems , in which , as he admits , his imagination works simultaneously along the poetic and the musical line , and his symphonies , in which , he contends , he is first and last ' writing just music ' . But the fallacy here is that unless a composer is writing out-and-out pure ' music , music of the simple pattern-for-its-own-sake order , music that just delights , like the kitten , in the game it is playing with its own tail , he must be making his music express , in all its phases , some strong emotion that has taken possession of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his imagination will take a course subconsciously dictated to him by that emotion . Now the musical faculty does not exist in a watertight compartment , shut off from the rest of the mind and the nature and the experience of the man . As George Henry Lewes put it , the whole man thinks ' ? not this or that convolution of his brain , functioning in a sealed recess of its own . And so , even though the composer is not specifically working to a programme , none the less , if he is expressing himself and his experience of life in the music he has in hand , he is letting the substance and the pattern of his music take on the nature and the contour of something that is not , in the strict sense of the term , pure ' music . Sibelius himself gives up his own case when he admits that of course it has happened that , quite unbidden , some mental image has established itself in my mind in connection with a symphonic movement that I have written , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , having been solely musical ' . Precisely : his seventh symphony , though purely musical ' in the sense that it has no programme that could be put into words , is all the same controlled by mental images ' that are , in essence , poetic or pictorial or experiential . That is to say , the notes go  | this way or that , a theme is silent for a long time and then suddenly recurs , not because Sibelius is working , in the style of abstract ' music , to a preconceived decorative pattern , but because the vicissitudes of his emotions , of his mental images ' , control the nature and the course of the music . Why , for instance , should that impressive trombone call occur twice just when and where it does , if not for the reason that it had to come then and there and nowhere else and at no other times , because it answers to some controlling mental image ' that has its organic part to play in the evolution of the total musical idea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , unlike Tapiola ' , it has no extra-musical basis that could be put into words , but it is none the less poetic ' music as well as being just music ' . It is a symphony , not a symphonic poem ; but the distinction is one less of kind than of degree . It is not generally recognised that externally-derived mental images ' often play a considerable part in the tissue of a musical work that is held to be ' just music ' . Composers are rightly reticent about these matters , for they do not want absurd ' programmes ' to be read into their music , which would be sure to happen if they gave their listeners the clue to this or that image ' . Nevertheless , these mental images ' come and go in their imagination in the act of composition to an extent that would surprise us did the composers take us into their confidence . It is only through a chance remark of Brahms that we discover that the horn call in the preamble to the finale of his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pastoral scene . There is a passage in Gerontius ' that was always associated in Elgar 's mind with the impressions he used to receive , as a tiny boy , of the swaying of the tops of the noble trees in a private park which I also know well . The reader can amuse himself , if he likes , by trying to locate the passage in the score ; but I can assure him in advance that he has not the ghost of a chance of finding it , for there is nothing whatever either in the words or in the shape of the music to give him the clue ; the mental image ' , visual in origin , has been transmuted into music pure and simple . A composer 's imagination functions not as a self-contained faculty on a sort of a desert island of its own , but as a whole  | the whole man thinks . It is inevitable , therefore , that his music , whether he knows it or not ( and often he is unaware of it himself ) , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have sunk deep within him and become part of the tissue of his brain and being . If , then , we are going to call his music pure ' music because it has no formal programme or is not a setting of words , it is evident that we must give a special meaning to the word pure ' ; the music is certainly not pure ' in the sense that the first movement of a Brandenburg Concerto is . When we thus get to the back of the beyond of the composer 's mentality we find that many a procedure on his part that seems , on the face of it , to be dictated by words , or episodes , or some other external prompting , is in reality merely the spontaneous musical expression of a mood that pre-existed in him already ; that is to say , it is not determined by the words or the situation , but merely seizes upon these in order to realise itself .  | AN OBITUARY NOTICE 2nd September 1957 SIBELIUS had become almost a legendary musical figure even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced his last major works . His Seventh Symphony seems almost as remote in time from us as the Fourth of Brahms or the Sixth of Tchaikovsky or the Ninth of Mahler . Whether he actually completed an eighth or not we do not as yet know for certain , or if he did , what his reasons were for withholding it from publication or performance . In no country , with the exception of his own , will the news of his death have been received with such regret as in ours . His first vogue in England was primarily due to the insight and the zeal of Henry Wood and Granville Bantock in the Concert hall , and Mrs. Rosa Newmarch in the Press . Those beginnings were so long ago that comparatively few of Sibelius 's English admirers of today can have taken part in them : my own acquaintance with him , personal and artistic , dates from over half a century ago . Until he came upon the scene , Finland had not been musically on the map ' , and none of us knew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owed next to nothing to Germany or France , nor , when one really got down to thinking about it , to the geographically adjacent Scandinavia or Russia , each of which had already by that time staked out a claim to a musical idiom and a musical field of thought of its own . The talk current at that time about performances of the nationalistic Finlandia ' being frowned upon by the Russian authorities seemed to suggest that this young Northerner 's affiliations were not precisely Muscovite , though I still have the clearest recollection of his being placed somehow or other ,  | on the strength of his First Symphony , in the Tchaikovsky succession . It was not long , however , before he came into full clear definition as just Jean Sibelius , the most individual composer , perhaps , the most purely self-forming and self-maintaining , the world has ever seen . He seems to have inhabited a mental world entirely his own . To what extent that world can be regarded basically as a Finnish world only a Finn can say . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sibelius through Finnish eyes but of seeing Finland through the eyes of Sibelius . By individual ' I mean simply that he talks , in his minor as well as his major works , in an idiom melodically , harmonically , rhythmically and orchestrally his own . The tracts of thought he opened out to us are purely his own : no one could ever imagine any other signature , personal or racial , upon any page of his music than that of Jean Sibelius . * * * The intriguing thing about it all is that he achieved this individualism without resort to any factitious doctrinaire nonsense about re-creating himself ' , or making a new language for himself ' . In one work after another , the musical language he speaks is the ordinary one , but he manages to say entirely different things in each work according to the mood or the vision of the moment . It may turn out that this curious independence of mind and of speech will operate in Sibelius 's favour as one generation succeeds another . It not infrequently happens that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while , because of his association in the public mind with some ism ' or other ? romanticism , neo-classicism , realism , impressionism , etc. ? that happens to have got out of fashion ; but it is impossible to pin any ism ' label at all on Sibelius 's music . Acceptance of it depends on nothing but itself , what it says and how it says it .  | DE SENECTUTE 18th April 1948 A SENSITIVE performance of Strauss 's Metamorphosen ' by Dr. Boyd Neel and his orchestra the other evening set me thinking afresh not only about the work itself but about the perpetually fascinating question of old men 's music . There have not been very many opportunities of hearing the Metamorphosen ' , but latterly we have been able to study it intensively , the full score having been published by Boosey and Hawkes a little while ago . Strauss describes his work as a Study for twenty-three solo strings . It appears to have been written in 1945 , when he was eighty-one . The title is intriguing . A study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of what , and why ? He introduces at the ninth bar a fragment from the Funeral March of the Eroica ; he makes liberal use of it in the course of the work , and towards the end the main theme of the March appears in rather fuller form with a footnote , In memoriam ! ' This Beethoven reference can hardly escape any listener ; but there are others , less immediately obvious , to the theme of King Marke 's lament in the second act of Tristan ' and to certain passages in the Rosenkavalier ' . It does not matter whether all these references are willed or unconscious on Strauss 's part ; they are unmistakably there , and they play as important a part in the building up of the overriding mood of the work as the Eroica theme does . The publication of the score has enabled us to get a much better idea of the Metamorphosen ' than was possible a couple of years or so ago . On those occasions it was inevitable that what should engage our attention most was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concentrate on Strauss 's contribution to the matter . The result is that now , for myself at any rate , the Metamorphosen ' reveals itself as one of his major orchestral works . It shows a remarkable command of a way of working new to him . The distant beginning of that way  | is found in the sonatas and quartets of Beethoven 's last period . The old attempts to expound these in terms of sonata form , variation form and all the rest of the old classroom terminology have visibly ended in futility . The error of the analysts has been the one bequeathed to us by the nineteenth century pedagogues ? to approach music through the medium of forms ' instead of through the mental complex of which a form is merely the envelope . Beethoven 's mind had undergone a profound transformation in his final phase , and the last works are the outcome of that change , not of an impulse to extend ' , to modify ' , certain forms ' . Sonata form ' and all the rest of it had by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned , because the conditions that had brought that form into being had served their historic turn and passed away . Beethoven now constructs in a new way because he is thinking in a new way ; he no longer creates by means of parallel and converging lines ? ' subjects ' ? but from a centre outwards ; everything that happens in the music of a movement is the proliferation of a single cell . Nineteenth-century instrumental composers , Brahms included , did not , because they could not , follow Beethoven in his last period ; their model was the Beethoven of the second . But with the final liquidation of sonata form ? which , as I have said , accomplished its historic mission long ago ? the concentric way of thinking and building has become more and more attractive to the greater composers ; and I find it fascinatingly employed in the Metamorphosen ' . My object today , however , is not to discuss third-period Beethoven but to touch on Strauss 's work as a sample of old men 's music . The great composers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystic heights with Pater Seraphicus . So did Wagner , in a different fashion and by a different route . Bach put the whole weight of his great brain into the task ? even though he did not consciously see that as his task ? of demonstrating by means of a fugue subject certain cosmic laws of growth and form . The gloomy Verdi became a prism of pure light in Falstaff ' . Strauss , in the Metamorphosen ' and the lovely oboe concerto , turns with a smile from the ugly and stupid and vulgar world that is now ours and finds a way of his own to a Xanadu of his own .  | One question I often ask myself is what the music of certain geniuses would have been like had they attained to old age ; and that question confronts us in its most intriguing form in Schubert . His dates make us think of him as a little later than Mozart and a contemporary of Beethoven ; it is not generally realised that had the ordinary span of years been allotted to him he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of his youth than has been the case with any other composer . He could have heard every one of Berlioz 's works and seen Berlioz himself into his grave , and still have been only seventy-two . He could have heard Aida ' at seventy-four and still been nearly ten years younger than Strauss is now . At sixty-three he could have studied the published score of Tristan ' ; he could have heard that work in the theatre at sixty-eight and the Meistersinger ' at seventy-one ? five years younger than the still-growing Vaughan Williams is now . What , we ask ourselves , would have been the effect on his unique genius of the impact of all these and other experiences ?  | 18th September 1949 B &Low; said of Mendelssohn that he began as a genius and ended as a talent . Would he say the same if he were living today , of the Richard Strauss whose early promise he was one of the first to perceive ? ( Billow died in 1894 , after having lived to hear the Aus Italien ' and Macbeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Tod and Verklarung ' of 1889 . ) Perhaps not , having regard to the Oboe Concerto and the Metamorphoses ' of the composer 's last years ; but he would still have maintained regretfully , I think , that the worst enemy of the genius in Strauss was the talent that dogged its footsteps from first to last . The trouble with Strauss was not , as with Mendelssohn , that the talent succeeded the genius in time and dissipated the rich heritage , but that the two walked and worked hand in hand throughout the greater part of his career . It is a significant fact in this connection that the majority of the works of Strauss that will endure were written between the twenty-third and forty-eighth of his eighty-five years ? between , that is , the Macbeth ' of 1887 and the first Ariadne auf Naxos ' of 1912 . The notable works fall also into two ten-year periods , each of intensive exploration and creation in a particular sphere . Between 1888 and 1898 he produced the remarkable series of orchestral works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , Tod and Verklarung ' , Till Eulenspiegel ' , Also sprach Zarathustra ' , Don Quixote ' , and Ein Heldenleben ' . Half-way through this brilliant decade he made his first excursion in opera with Guntram ' ( 1894 ) . The great operatic period began tentatively in 1901 with Feuersnot ' , a work of mixed quality ; then , after an interval of four years , during which the only big orchestral work that came from his pen was the inflated and mostly abortive Symphonia Domestica ' ( 1903 ) ? which gave many of us at that time the uncomfortable feeling  | that he had written himself out at thirty-nine ? came , like a bolt from the blue , the challenging Salome ' of 1905 , which , defective as it was in parts , was manifestly the sign of a growth in both imaginative range and technical mastery to which the only parallel in the history of opera is Wagner 's development from Tannhauser ' and Lohengrin ' to The Rhincgold ' . Three years later came the still more astonishing Elektra ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , which played with equal ease and certainty of touch over the most varied psychological fields . . After that came , in 1912 , the first version of Ariadne auf Naxos ' , in which , side by side with miniature masterpieces such as the quintet of the comedians ( ' Es gilt , ob Tanzen , ob Singen , tauge ' ) , there were indications that the great sea of his inspiration was setting to an ebb-tide . After that he made only one big attempt at purely orchestral writing in the Alpine Symphony ' of 1915 , a work which , for all its occasional flashes of pictorial ingenuity , was and remains a failure . He now devoted himself for many years almost entirely to works for the stage ? two ballets : The Legend of Joseph ' ( 1914 ) and Schlagobers ' ( 1924 ) , and the operas Die Frau ohe Schatten ' ( 1919 ) , Intermezzo ' ( 1925 ) , Die aegyptische Helena ' ( 1928 ) , Arabella ' ( 1933 ) , Die schweigsame Frau ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Der Friedenstag ' ( 1938 ) , Daphne ' ( 1938 ) and Die Liebe der Danae ' ( 1944 ) . There is some first-rate Strauss in most of these ; but it is significant that none of them has won a footing in the world repertory . ( The only one of them that has been given in England is Arabella ' . ) In all of them the talent bulks larger than the genius . A fascinating subject for the study of Strauss as man and artist is the youthful opera Guntram ' . It attacts us in the first place by a peculiar spiritual highmindedness ; Guntram is a sort of latter-day Parsifal . The spiritual , the ethical , seems however to have faded out of Strauss 's make-up in later life . The opera , for all its unevenness of texture , is a work that still commands the respect of the Strauss student of today . It contains in embryo practically all the later operatic Strauss except , of course , the humorist , for whom there was no place in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us as we look back upon it in the light of the entire Strauss are the first , unmistakable hints here and there of the weakness so characteristic of him in the after years , the talent in him masquerading for long stretches as genius , speaking with the same voice , wearing the same clothes , adopting the same postures , making the same gestures as its counterpart , and saying what appear on the surface to be the same vital things but are only the simulacra of them . Long ago I tried to characterise this aspect of him in the simile of a great windmill beating the air majestically with its arms but grinding out no corn . I will have more to say on this subject in a following article before embarking on a discussion of Strauss 's real qualities as an artist . 25th September 1949 STRAUSS , of course , was not the only composer to call occasionally upon almost-as-good talent to carry on glibly with the job of music-making while his genius took a day off . Eighteenthcentury music provides us with examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is particularly given to it . There is no outward difference between one of the very best and one of the least best of the opening movements , let us say , of his concerti grossi . The difference is internal ; one movement is the real thing , the other , going about the same business in precisely the same way , is only good-quality make-believe . We have no complaint against procedures of this kind in music , such as a great deal of that of the eighteenth century , that makes no bones about complacently working in certain accepted patterns ; we cheerfully admit that in the nature of the case there must be times when the pattern is less vitalised from within than at others . But we are not tolerant of it in modern music , where the first thing we demand of a composer is that the form and the substance of a work , or of a long stretch of a work , shall be the natural and specific outward manifestation of the ideas ,  | not a mould into which ideas can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that when at less than his best he drops lazily into formulae , moulds , patterns of his own . Mechanics of that sort , on any but the smallest scale , are unacceptable today because , the composer 's train of thought being largely psychological , we expect both the matter and the manner of the expression to be organically germane to the psychology or the situation of the moment , not simply a reachme-down garment thrown hastily about it . Strauss 's worst incursions into the hocus-pocus occur in moments when a big gathering up of all the threads is called for . His method at times like this is to play off concurrent or imitative orchestral strands against each other in great surging and receding waves of tone . We see the real thing in the orchestral postlude to the great trio in the Rosenkavalier ' . Of the make-believe thing I could cite examples by the hundred from his less distinguished operas and the Symphonia Domestica ' had I the space to do so . But this distressing bluff of posing in the full majestic panoply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly most weak and tired is seldom resorted to in the two ten-year periods in which his genius burned most brightly . In these he did enough to ensure him a permanent high place in musical history . He left music a different thing in many ways from what he found it . He diverted the great main stream of German music into several new channels , each time with conspicuous success . He enlarged enormously the scope of psychological and characteristic expression , not only in his best operas but in his concert music ; his Don Juan , Don Quixote , Till Eulenspiegel , Macbeth , Baron Ochs , Octavian , Marschallin , Sophie , Salome , Elektra , Orestes and Clytemnestra are as alive as any characters in music . Certain types evaded him , of course . He himself gave comic expression to his lack of imaginative sympathy with the Joseph of his ballet : the simplemindedness of Chrysothemis baffled him . ( See how , on the other hand , Wagner has limned his simple Gutrune in a couple of immortal bars that go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrait gallery  | of Strauss is extensive enough and varied enough and vital enough to make an occasional failure pardonable . He laid the foundations , in the great sweeping melodies of his youthful Don Juan ' - which were something without a parallel at that time in German or any other music ? for a new melodic style , that of musical prose , which at its best can be as wonderful as the finest musical metric , surpassing this , indeed , in sweep of line , variety of phrase-articulation , and the shifting of the accentual footfall . ( In this respect he was the heir not of Wagner but of Berlioz , whose achievements in this field have not yet received the consideration they deserve . ) In Salome ' and Elektra ' in particular he proved that tonal harmony is still capable of new subtilisations : Why do you trouble to write atonally , ' he remarked ironically to a leading young member of the atonal school , when you have talent ? ' Finally , in each of his best orchestral works he cast his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , for example , his choice of the variation form for Don Quixote ' , the rondo form for Till Eulenspiegel ' , and the vast reconstruction and rehabilitation of the classical sonata form in Ein Heldenleben ' . His virtuosity was at times amazing ; there is nothing in all instrumental music like the section in the latter work ( ' The Hero 's Works of Peace ' ) in which he quoted theme after theme from his own earlier works . The mere fusion of them all into an organic musical whole would of itself have been a technical feat of the first order ; but more astonishing even than that is the imaginative power that somehow made a psychological unity of it all , a poignant expression of resignation and nostalgia . Yes , he was of the royal line , even if some queer kink of indolence and cynicism in him made him too often content to play the part of the Old Pretender.  | 4th June 1933 WE hear a great deal in these days about Verdi overhauling Wagner in the matter of popularity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to which the Verdi operas of the late middle period have to be subjected to make working modern propositions of them , we find it difficult to repress a smile . Wagner may sometimes have to be cut , but that is purely and simply to suit the exigencies of normal theatre hours . We have not yet arrived at the stage when a whole scene of Tristan ' , let us say , can be sacrificed without the audience feeling that the work has not been at all damaged , but , if anything , improved : still less the stage at which this page or that can be taken bodily out of , say , the G ? tterdammerung ' and a page or two out of the Meistersinger ' or Parsifal ' advantageously substituted for it . And the fact that this kind of thing can , roughly speaking , be done with certain works of Verdi , and occasionally , indeed , has to be done , is hardly calculated to make us believe that in Verdi we have a musical dramatist of the thoroughbred kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Don Carlo ' put on the stage in a form that represents the co-operation of more than one hand besides Verdi 's , a fact which of itself makes us approach both Don Carlo ' in particular and Verdi in general with mixed feelings . I am not , be it understood , quarrelling with this drastic adaptation : on the contrary , I thoroughly approve of it , for it is only on some such terms as these that Don Carlo ' becomes possible at all in these days . It is generally urged , as an excuse for so much in the work that is feeble and clumsy , that it was written for the Paris Opera , an alien institution in which Verdi never felt altogether at home . But that really will not do . When Don Carlo ' was first produced , in 1867 , Verdi was a man of fifty-four , with the experience behind him of more than twenty operas . He was not bound to accept a badly constructed drama from anyone , still less to write so much bad music for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew neither how bad the libretto was nor how  | bad most of his music to it was . Later reflection brought him a certain amount of wisdom on these points ; hence the later revisions of the opera . But the mere fact that a writer of his age and experience could turn out such a work as the original Don Carlo ' justifies a doubt not merely as to his being fundamentally a front-rank musician ? which few thinking people would claim for him today  --  but as to whether he was the consummate dramatist he is popularly supposed to have been . A real dramatist would have seen at a glance that the first libretto of Don Carlo ' was third-rate stuff , and , holding the position of power that Verdi then did in the European operatic world , would have refused point-blank to have anything to do with it . Verdi seems to me to have had comparatively little of the genuine dramatist in him . He was something superficially similar but not quite the same : he was a good man of the theatre ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first rank of that category , otherwise he would not so often have accepted a poor libretto and so often have been content to repeat the same wretched formula in one work after another . We might define the difference between the real dramatist and the skilled man of the theatre as being very much the difference between the statesman and the politician : the latter knows all the tricks of the trade , but he has neither the brains , the cultural background , nor the vision of the former . Verdi has created very few real characters in music ; all he has done , for the most part , is to ring the changes on a certain number of formulae that do indeed take on a slightly different aspect in this opera or that , but remain basically the same . And it was because at bottom he had so little of the genuine dramatist , the genuine psychologist in him that his music remains , underneath all its surface changes , so astonishingly the same through all his periods ; he was by nature incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a new turn and a new tissue and complexion not only to each of Wagner 's dramas but to the music of each of them . It is a far cry from Rienzi ' or even the Flying Dutchman ' to ' Parsifal ' ; but in Aida ' and Otello ' we remain in very much the same house as that of Rigoletto ' , I1 Trovatore ' , La Traviata ' , and Ernani ' , even though the structure of the old house be strengthened later at this point or  | that , the walls hung with a better paper , the furniture better carved and more tastefully upholstered . It is astonishing , when one comes to study Verdi 's music critically , how little he really changed from first to last ; time after time , in his latest works , we discover that a really fine piece of expression is actually nothing more than an old formula with a better face on it . Unfortunately the reverse is also true ; as likely as not , a later work will show us not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventive powers as a musician were singularly restricted . His works are a series of palimpsests ; scratch away the upper writing from this or that scene or number in a later work , and you will generally discover , underneath it , an inferior version of the same thing that has figured in some earlier work . But frequently , as I have said , the later version of the stereotyped formula is not better , but worse . Scratch out , for instance , the wretched mandoline chorus in Otello ' and you find beneath it on the parchment two of the choruses from Don Carlo ' . And the trouble is that , paltry as these two Don Carlo ' choruses are , that in Otello ' is paltrier still in itself , and , in addition , so foolish in respect to that opera as a whole that it is really difficult to give the title of a great dramatist to the man who could deface such a work as Otello ' with so stupid an excrescence . There are ensembles in Don Carlo ' in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he makes use in the celebrated quartet in Rigoletto ' ; but unfortunately what is genius in the specimen of it in the earlier work degenerates into mere talent in the later . Each of the operas of his later period keeps alternately harking backward and looking forward : in one case he will do rather better , in another case rather worse , what he has already done more than once before . Don Carlo ' , for instance , is often interesting because it reads like a sketch for something that Verdi was to do better in Aida ' or Otello ' . He developed , of course , as he went on , but in a way of his own that was consistent with the stubborn nature of his whole being , both as man and as artist . He could hardly enlarge his first range very much ; but he could give a new intensity or a new beauty or a new distinction to something he had already  | hammered away at a hundred times . The final truth seems to be that Verdi was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxically enough , this man of over eighty was one of the composers who can be said to have died too young . I find the first really great upward swing not in the Aida ' of 1871 ( when Verdi was fifty-eight ) , but in the Requiem of 1874 . There are inspirations of a rare order in Aida ' , but there are also lapses into the old Verdian vulgarity and inanity of a kind and of a frequency that would astonish us in the case of any other composer . His progress in Aida ' and the great Otello ' has three aspects . He generally subtilises and refines his old formulae to such an extent that to the ordinary listener the affiliation of the new music with the old is not apparent . He develops an extraordinary beauty of orchestral tone-combination , and a new art of getting dramatic atmosphere by this means ? witness the Nile scene and the temple scene in Aida ' . And , to the limited extent that was possible to any Italian composer of that epoch , he unconsciously obeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symphonic as he gets older . This development was very striking in Wagner , though criticism has not yet dealt with it adequately . Verdi , in his smaller way , and lacking , of course , the great symphonic tradition that was at the back of the big German writers , also reaches out , latterly , into the symphonic , that is to say , into the working-out of a figure for its own intrinsic musical possibilities , at the same time that he makes this purely orchestral evolution of it serve the dramatic intention . From the first he had been given to deciding upon a certain accompaniment figure and repeating it throughout a number . But in his earlier works not only is the figure itself often banal or downright ludicrous , but his handling of it is amateurish . Compare with any of these earlier efforts his fine treatment of the iterative ascending figure in one of Amonasro 's phrases in the Nile scene , or the magnificent evolution of the writhing orchestral figure that accompanies Otello 's Dio , mi potevi scagliar ' ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which , in his later years , Verdi was developing as a musician pure and simple . Yet , still obeying that curious law in him that made his  | evolution not the consistent thing it has been in the case of certain other composers who have lived long , but a series of leaps forward and slippings back , he was capable of the strangest lapses almost to the end . His string quartet of 1873 ( i.e. , two years after Aida ' ) is a dilettantish piece of work . Make what allowances we will for the fact that this was his first effort ( or at all events his first public effort ) in symphonic form , still one expects something better than this from a man who had been writing music for more than half a century . It has been said , somewhat unthinkingly , that his greatness , as compared with Wagner , is shown by his ending his days with a comedy rather than with a work of brooding seriousness . But it was really much easier for him to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , from Otello ' , to a work that should be to the whole of his previous life's-work what Parsifal ' was to Wagner 's . For in Falstaff ' he had a comparatively easy task . A composer of declining powers can somewhat easily achieve a masterpiece , or something near a masterpiece , in a genre that gives him the support of a great tradition , as Strauss has proved with the Rosenkavalier ' . At that stage of his career Strauss had virtually written himself out as an original and significant thinker in music ; yet out of the formulae transmitted to him by Johann Strauss and others he could still weave new shapes of the greatest beauty . In Falstaff ' , Verdi had the great tradition of Italian comic opera to fall back upon ; he had not much more to do than follow in the steps of masterpieces like ' Il Barbiere ' and I1 Matrimonio Segreto ' and Don Pasquale ' , and , with his now refined sensibility and his skilled old hand , give a fresh turn of his own to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superbly ; but who can deny that his task was relatively easy , in the way that Strauss 's was in the Rosenkavalier ' , and that he would have found it as much harder to write a new serious drama that would go as far beyond Otello ' and Aida ' as these are beyond Il Trovatore ' and Rigoletto ' and Don Carlo ' , as it evidently was for Strauss to do , in The Egyptian Helen ' , anything better than , or even as good as , the orchestral works of his prime ? One of the very worst things in Don Carlo ' is the marziale ' episode in the last act ; even the most fanatical Verdians have  | nothing but an amused contempt for it . We could have understood , and might have forgiven , this appalling lapse had it been in the original version of 1867 . But when we discover that this passage is one of those added to the work when Verdi revised it in 1884 ? only three years before Otello ' !  --  we are faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously zigzag line , the downward curves of which were liable to dip so low as occasionally to drag him practically back to the point from which he had started .  | GENERAL ARTICLES FIRST AID FOR CRITICS 14th November 1920 I SEE from the November Bulletin of the British Music Society that among the subjects suggested for the morning debates ' at the Society 's next Congress is , What is wrong with musical criticism in England ? ' They 've evidently noticed it ! Well , what is wrong with musical criticism in England ? Some people , of course , will answer , The musical critics ' ; but that is only a fragment of the correct answer . Something will have to be said on the economic side of the matter ; something , also , on the strange conditions under which the critics mostly have to work . There will be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that musical criticism as a whole , in this country , does not play its part in musical culture as it might do . The trouble is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and the performers on the other , to see that a change is desirable ; and a still further trouble is to decide what form that change should take . We want to get the best brains possible into the business , and to give them the scope that the best brains get in every other department of art or science or literature where it is recognised that the only people who have a right to talk on a specialised subject are the specialists . We must first of all get rid of the idea that it is the business of the musical critic to be always right about everything . An American musical journal used to amuse us by printing in parallel columns all the passages in which the New York critics had contradicted each other over this or that work of the week , or this or that person 's singing or playing . But whoever expects everyone to think alike , on music or any other subject ? If they did , one newspaper would suffice for a whole country . We expect a given score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of music or a performance as they would of the motives of a politician or the evidence in a trial .  | All we ask , in either case , is that a man shall not express an opinion , especially in public , till he has the knowledge of the subject and the cultivated reasoning faculty that alone would entitle him to do so ; or , failing that , that he shall at least be a personality and a stylist , so that even his wrong-headedness ( if he be wrong ) may have some sort of interest for us . Which of us , in the old days , would not have preferred to read John F. Runciman when he was hopelessly wrong than Joseph Bennett when he was hopelessly right ? The great thing is that the public shall be taught to think for itself ; and the dull writer or the conventional thinker will never make it do that . But getting the best brains in England into the business will not be much use unless they are employed on the newspapers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , indispensable ; they can print articles that would either be too long for a daily newspaper or would be out of place there . But human nature being what it is , and the Press being as dependent as it is upon advertisements of hair-restorers and safety razors and ladies ' lingerie , no specialist journal can hope to have anything like the circulation of a big newspaper . It is strange that the Potterite press has not already seen that a large new public that is keenly interested in music has sprung up in recent years , and that it would not be uneconomic idealism but sound business to cater intelligently for it . The criticism in the specialised journals is sound enough . It is in the daily Press that the weakness lies partly because , even when the paper has an able man for its musical critic , it often will not allow him to show his best ; and until the daily newspaper realises that its musical readers expect the same level of intelligence in those who write for it as the business man expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political columns , we shall never get any further . The suggestion was made to me a year or so ago by a correspondent that , instead of writing about the music of the past week , the critic would be more generally interesting if he were to write on the music of the coming week , separating the good from the bad , and telling the intending concert-goer why he ought to go to hear this work rather than that , and what he ought to listen specially for in it . That plan bristles with diffi-  | culties ; but part of it may be practicable some day . A better plan for the immediate present , I think , would be to administer first-aid not only to the audiences but to the critics . It is becoming increasingly difficult to take in new works at a mere first hearing . I do not mean the tiny new works of the type of those of the French and Russian schools that we have been hearing lately ; they present no more difficulty than a child 's box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the making of which some hard thinking has gone , and that shows some complexity of design . The best musician living can not grasp it all as it passes swiftly by him in performance . Sometimes a programme note will help him , especially if the leading themes are quoted . But often there is no programme note , particularly in the case of new Chamber music . Would it not be to everyone 's advantage if someone ? preferably the composer ? would give us ten minutes ' preliminary talk about it at the piano , playing us the chief themes two or three times , so as to fix them in our memory , sketching the sort of development they receive , drawing our attention to points that we particularly ought to observe , and so on ? It would be better for the audience , because under the present system the ordinary non-practising music-lover must often lose himself in the course of a complicated work . It would be better for the critics , because , once familiar with the thematic skeleton of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trying to pick this out and memorise it , but could give all their attention to the imaginative use the composer was making of his material . It would be better for the composer , because the next day 's criticisms of his music would be at any rate a stage further from evasive guesswork than they usually are at present . And if it were better for all these people , it would necessarily be better for the reader of the criticism . Something of this sort , I feel , will have to be done some day in the case of new works of any scope .  | 23rd September 1923 A COUPLE of weeks ago Mr. Kalisch told us a story which , he seemed to think , settled finally those of us who , on the average of cases , prefer our music at home to going to the concert room or the opera house for it . Weingartner , it appears , has told how Wagner once stopped a rehearsal of one of his own operas and said Cut out the trombones ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I have lost the cutting , and can quote only from memory . ) Mr. Kalisch 's argument , if I remember it rightly , was this how can any of us pretend to get from the reading of a score the picture the composer had in his mind when he wrote it , seeing that the composer himself , no matter how skilled in orchestration he may be , sometimes miscalculates an effect ? Do we profess to know more about orchestration than a Wagner or an Elgar , to have a finer ear than he has ? That would be a crushing argument if it were relevant : the only objection to it is that it is quite irrelevant . In the first place , perhaps I may be permitted to remind Mr. Kalisch that complicated orchestral music constitutes a very small proportion of the music that a musician is interested in . I cheerfully concede that it is often difficult sometimes even impossible ? to imagine precisely what the effect will be of a certain combination of instruments . But though none of us can work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freaks who now and then astonish the scientific world , we can all of us do ordinary little sums quite rapidly , and , with a little figuring , sums of a more advanced nature . If the man I am sitting next to at Queen 's Hall tells me he can realise a page of Sch ? nberg 's Pelleas and Melisande ' after one reading of the full score , I shall regard him as either a unique genius or a good fellow with a prodigious gift for fiction ; but I shall look upon him as a very poor musician if he tells me that he can not read with perfect understanding the score of any song , any piano piece , any violin piece , any quartet , any  | madrigal or part-song , or the vocal score of any opera . Further he needs only to be a passable musician to be able to read any full score , a few of the more complicated modern scores excepted . Any one who contends that only the physical ear is to be trusted as the judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criticism of music are impossible : for the historian and the critic have to rely wholly and solely upon their reading in the case of nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand works about which they write . Not one of us has heard a hundredth part of one per cent of the polyphonic music of the fifteenth and sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that we discuss so freely : our knowledge of it is derived entirely from the printed page . No opera is now regularly performed of earlier date than Gluck 's Orfeo ' ( 1762 ) ; yet historians pass judgement confidently on a hundred operas earlier than that . No writer upon Bach or Mozart or Haydn has heard more than a very small proportion of the works of these men : he bases his judgement on the other works upon his reading of the scores . Even in the case of modern works it is upon the score rather than a performance that a careful critic relies : a page of Le Sacre du Printemps ' may puzzle him in performance , but it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The mere reading of music is , then , a necessity to the student of musical history . But it is more than a necessity : it is a keen pleasure , and , for me , a keener pleasure , in nine cases out of ten , than that of concert-going . I have never committed myself to what would be the nonsensical statement that the eye can do the work of the ear so well that there is no need ever to hear music . All I have claimed is that ? for me , at least ? a reading of a piece of music gives me so much more pleasure than the average performance that I would not go to more than ten or twenty concerts in the year of my own free choice . The performances that give me the greatest pleasure do not throw the slightest new light on the work for me : it is the performer who thrills me . I see no more in a Schubert song after Elena Gerhardt has sung it than I did before : what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice and the perfection of her style . Perfection in performance is indeed  | worth leaving one 's fireside for on a winter 's night : but in how many cases are we fortunate enough to get it ? Further , there are some modern orchestral works that it would be an impertinence to judge finally from a reading alone , though the reading ? or , rather , many readings ? may be as necessary as the performance . I make no extreme claims for the pleasure of score-reading : I contend only that more reading and less hearing of music would be better for every music lover . It would spare him a good deal of physical exhaustion : it would prevent many a masterpiece becoming staled by excessive repetition ; it would ensure a great widening of his musical culture . He would get to know his favourite works better , and so enjoy them more when a perfect performance of one of them was given . There are many other benefits that he will discover for himself when he has practised score-reading for a year or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to be dependent on other people for his music as it would be for him to be dependent upon public readers for his knowledge of poetry or fiction . He would be ashamed of himself if he could not read Swinburne or Hardy for himself : he apparently feels no shame in the illiteracy that renders him unable to read Sibelius or Mahler for himself . Let us return to Mr. Kalisch , Weingartner , and Wagner . If I had wanted to invent a story that would have been all to the advantage of score-reading I could not have hit upon a more serviceable one than this . Let us suppose that Wagner had in this case miscalculated . I am not wholly convinced , let me say in parentheses , that he had . The acoustics of theatres vary greatly : what may sound too strident in one may be mellow enough in another . And needless to say , there are trombone players and trombone players . If a composer began cutting out effects that did not come off ' at this or that rehearsal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score left . Let me match Weingartner 's story with another . In 1881 , Lilli Lehmann was entrusted by Wagner with the selection and training of the Parsifal ' Flower Maidens . In her reminiscences she quotes a letter of his in which he insists that each of the sopranos shall be able to take the high B flat easily and pleasingly ' ; a single shrill organ ' , he adds , would spoil  | everything for me ' . At Bayreuth in 1882 , presumably , he got what he wanted ; but had he been at some rehearsals or performances of Parsifal ' that I have heard he would probably have said to the conductor , Cut out the B flat : the effect is too painful . ' He would , of course , have been wrong to have done so : whether this soprano or that can sing the high B flat purely and easily or not , the B flat is the right thing . I do not know the trombone passage to which Weingartner refers , so I can not say whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now have it . But this much is certain ? that Wagner wanted the trombone colour there . He would not have put it in unless it had been vital to his conception of the emotion of the scene . He imagined , that is to say , an ideal trombone tone and an ideal trombone player . Why then should the passage be cut out merely because some trombone tone and some trombone players are anything but ideal ? If we were reading this page of the score , we would do exactly what Wagner did when he wrote it ? mix up with the other timbres just as much trombone tone as was required for a perfect blend , and no more . Let us grant that the trombone tone is too much in the theatre , and has to be cut out . Then what happens is simply this ? that we are hearing something different from what Wagner desired , and that only some defect in the instrument or the player prevents him from conveying to the physical ear of the listener . So far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that is a convincing argument for it . I am pretty sure that even after that rehearsal , whenever Wagner let that page run through his mind , it was with the trombone colour , not without it ; and if the trombone part is in our present scores , I am sure he would be glad to think that we , as we read the page , hear it mentally as he conceived it . In fact , the story sets me dreaming of the possibility of a new kind of music , meant entirely for the inner ear , through the eye , and quite impossible of performance . II 3oth September 1923 I THREATENED in last week 's article to outline a new kind of  | music , addressed in the main , to the eye rather than the ear , or , perhaps I ought to say , to the inward ear through the eye ? in a word , composers ' music rather than performers ' music . It may astonish the reader to learn that he rarely gets what I call composers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get is generally a rough compromise between composers ' music and performers ' music , between what the composer imagined and what the instrument , whether vocal or instrumental , can do . Dramatists would feel it very awkward if actors were incapable , under certain circumstances , of pronouncing certain letters or combinations of letters . Suppose , for instance that 1 and v could be sounded together pleasingly only at a pitch very much above the ordinary pitch of the speaking voice . The result of this would be that the hero could only say to the heroine I love you ' by raising his voice to an unholy screech on the vital word of the sentence ; and the result of that would be that the word love ' would be barred from the stage . What , under these circumstances , would the dramatist do ? Being unable to refrain from the use of such words as these merely because actors found it difficult or impossible to pronounce them without becoming raucous or ridiculous , he would write two kinds of plays , one to be spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what my prophetic eye tells me will be done in music some day . The instruments through which the composer has to express himself are lamentably imperfect . It is not merely that the performers sometimes fail to reach the ideal : a much more serious trouble is that the instruments , purely qua instruments , are full of limitations and imperfections . They are limited in range ; they are often dumb when we would like them to speak , or ( which is worse ) speak when we would prefer them to be dumb ; they get tired , and refuse to go on with their phrase just when it is becoming most interesting ; they are touchy , and , if you do not understand them or humour them , will indeed play the phrase for you since you insist on it , but will make it sound hideous , and then tell you it does n't suit them ? that you have put in an A flat , let us say , and they have a constitutional objection to A flat . The wood-wind , in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their bad ; they change their  | colour and their substances as they traverse their scales ; they petulantly refuse to play this note or that , alleging that it is n't on the instrument ' , and insist on the composer handing it over to one of their colleagues ; they warn him not to write for them in this key or that fashion , because the fingering is difficult ; he must not write shakes or tremolos for them on certain notes ; and so on . I often wonder why composers stand it . One of these days , I am sure , they will rebel and write not for the clumsy instruments of the orchestra but for the ideal instruments , that can do anything , go anywhere , give forth any height or depth or quality of tone that he may desire . No longer will he have to spend anxious hours peering over treatises on orchestration . I was once with a composer when he was correcting the proofs of an overture . To his amusement he found that in a moment of abstractedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the lowest note on the instrument . Of course he had to modify the passage . But he would not have written that low A for the violins unless he had wanted the A in just that colour and no other . Think what a boon it would be to all orchestral composers to be set free from these irritating restrictions , to be able , at last , to put down on paper precisely what they wanted , not what the instruments will allow them to put down , and be sure that the reader will hear the tone-complex internally just as he , the composer , heard it ! No longer would he have to submit to the clarionet throwing up the sponge when it reaches the lowest note of its compass and handing over the continuation of the theme downwards to the bassoon . No longer would he have to take the theme out of the hands of one instrument at a certain point and give it to another , merely because at that point the first instrument , though it may have the notes , enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer would he have to endure the ignominy of being told by the experts that one of his favourite passages has been partly spoiled by his doggedly insisting on a certain instrument having it ? the lovely clarionet tune in the Oberon ' overture , for instance , which has the misfortune to circulate round the three or four notes that are weakest on the clarionet.  | When I am told that we must wait until we have not only read but can hear a composer 's work before we judge it I can not repress a sad smile . For not in one case in a thousand , perhaps , do we hear the music as the composer dreamed it . There is no means by which he can convey his dream to us in all its purity . He has to tell it to us through instruments of all kinds , the imperfections of which make his music , in its practical form , a series of fakes and compromises . Sometimes he has to choose between a method of performance that deliberately makes nonsense of his conception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception , ends in a catastrophe for the instruments . Which of us has ever heard the last fifteen bars of Also sprach Zarathustra ' made to sound as Strauss intended them to sound ? If the flutes and piccolos play softly , their tone is thin , tremulous , ragged , uncertain : if they play loudly , Strauss 's idea is blown to the winds . If we really want to hear this passage as Strauss conceived it we must rely on the score and our imagination . In Lohengrin ' , Wagner writes a low B natural that is not on this modern flute . If I can imagine the effect of this , why should we not be allowed to imagine the effect of many another note that is not on a given instrument , or is ineffective ' on it ? Why should not composers be allowed to suggest to me , on paper , ideal combinations that are impossible or dangerous in performance ? The overtones of the double basses make it risky to combine these instruments with the lower notes of the flute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad to be deprived of them merely because the basses are apt to muddle them up . I can imagine all sorts of ideal blends of these two instruments ; why should the composer be barred from at any rate giving me these blends on paper ? In his Requiem ' ( the last few bars of the Hostias ' ) , Berlioz narrows his orchestra down to a few notes from the three flutes over some deep notes in eight tenor trombones . It probably sounds very nasty ' , says Mr. Cecil Forsyth , who quotes the passage in his admirable book on orchestration . Perhaps it does to the physical ear , and on flutes and trombones as they are now . But it certainly did not sound nasty to the mental ear of Berlioz , nor does it to mine ; I can perhaps imagine the ideal  | effect that Berlioz desired from the strange mixture of these two contrasted colours at that distance , with the ebbs and flows of the diminuendi and crescendi . I have never yet heard a performance of Sea Drift ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , sometimes much more ) , because of the difficulty the soloist has in singing Delius 's chromatic music dead in tune with the orchestra ; but that is not a reproach against Delius . Thank Heaven we have eyes as well as ears , and a spiritual as well as a fleshly ear . And I fervently hope that one of these days some composer will give me a work intended solely for my spiritual ear . While I am in this generous mood perhaps I may give composers the benefit of another suggestion . While I was listening to Miss Rosina Buckman singing an aria from Fidelio ' the other evening I was reminded of an article I wrote a dozen years or so ago , suggesting a new art-form ? concertos for singers . All other soloists have concertos specially written for their instruments , if a pianist wants to play with the orchestra , he does not have to cut a fragment out of a symphony and present its bleeding flesh and severed nerves to the audience . But the singer who wants to sing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of some opera , bad for the singer , and bad for us , for it is as difficult for her as it is for us to plunge into the psychology of the part at a moment 's notice . One fine day ' is effective enough in the second act of Madame Butterfly ' after all the emotional tension that finds its natural easing in the aria ; but neither the singer nor we can be expected to summon up two hours ' dramatic emotions in a twinkling of an eye . Why then does not some composer write a vocal concerto on the lines of the instrumental concerto ? a work that shall give the singer all possible opportunities , traverse a wide field of expression , and yet be an organic whole ? We have a hint of such a work in Beethoven 's Ah perfido ' ? a little concert-room drama in itself . Singers , I am sure , would welcome a development of this kind . Audiences certainly would . And it would give immense scope to the many composers who have the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1922 WATCHING the Carpentier-Cook fight the other evening , I could not help reflecting , as I had often done before , how much nicer it is to be an artist of some sort or other and improve as you get older , than to be an athlete or a sportsman or a gameplayer or something of that kind , and become a back number in your youth . Nature has really been very generous to the artist , when we come to think of it . Carpentier is still a miracle : the difference between his boxing and that of the ordinary heavy-weight is the difference between Chopin as played by Pachmann and the Meistersinger ' overture thumped out on the piano-player by the man next door . But in my humble nonprofessional way I venture to think that though Carpentier can still beat any ordinary heavy-weight , he is not quite the old Carpentier . Some of his blows in the first two rounds were misjudged in a way that would have been impossible to him a couple of years ago . Something of the old perfect adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail , I imagine ? at the age of twenty-seven . It is the same story in almost every sport ; the younger players make players very little older than themselves look like men of a past generation , and in a short time will themselves be edged out of the limelight by some fresh infant . Now see what happens to the artist of corresponding genius the composer , let us say , since this is a musical column . We speak condescendingly of these people 's early works ' ? works written at an age when the boxer or the billiard player would be winning championships : many of the art-works that really matter have hardly begun to be thought of until an age at which the boxer has either discreetly given up the game or is attempting the pathetic process known as coming back ' . I need hardly recall the standard instances of the vitality of the middle-aged or old musician ? Gluck commencing the reform of the opera at forty-eight ; Rameau beginning his long series of operas at fifty ; Beethoven writing his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meistersinger ' at fifty-four or so , the G ? tterdammerung ' at fifty-eight , and Parsifal ' at sixtyfive ; Verdi beginning a new period with Aida ' at fifty-eight , then producing Otello ' at seventy-five and Falstaff ' at eighty ; and so on . My point is that it is upon people like these , not upon the Carpentiers and Dempseys , that Nature has poured out her vitality with both hands . We think it wonderful that a boxer should be so strong . But given a good physique to begin with , what is there so wonderful in a man being strong when the whole of his daily life is devoted to the task of conserving his natural strength ? For a bit of a fight that at the most can run only to an hour or so , a boxer has to prepare intensively for weeks , on top of his ordinary regimen of care and commonsense . He grabs arld hoards every possible particle of strength , and wastes himself in no way . He denies himself most of the ordinary pleasures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainment of one end . And with all this , he is out of the running long before he is forty . Look now at the life of a Wagner ? using himself up in every imaginable way for something like fifty years , always doing three men 's work , writing great works at a cerebral white heat that lasts for months at a time , simultaneously interesting himself in almost everything else under the sun , thinking about it , talking about it , writing about it , carrying on an enormous correspondence by hand , travelling , conducting , undergoing all sorts of strains of body and spirit , pulling wires in a score of towns for the realisation of his one great desire for a theatre of his own ? and with it all , in spite of what he imagined to be constant ill-health , always lively in body and vigorous in mind , larking about among friends like a schoolboy , and running up trees for the pure boyish fun of the thing at sixty . Read the volume of Bayreuth Letters ? those dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first festival ? and you will be astounded at the energy and the competence of the man who , in addition to all the purely musical duties he had to attend to at the time , calmly works out , with the cold persistence and thoroughness of a general or the manager of a multiple store , every detail , down to food  | and lodging , of the problem of the influx of some hundreds of strangers into the little backwater of a town . Who can doubt that , all in all , Nature has put into a seemingly frail little body like this fifty times the vitality that she has put into the frame of any boxer ? The material must be wonderful to bear so much for so many years . And the question arises , if men like this do so much being what they are , what could they accomplish if they never wasted themselves ? Suppose a Wagner or a Beethoven ( whose natural strength was enormous ) had been taken in hand very young , and trained , as the boxer is trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality , keeping always in view the one end of getting the best out of himself that Nature had made possible for him , to what age might he not have lived and what work might he not have done ? It is impossible to doubt that Wagner 's constant satisfying of an insatiable appetite for all the good things of this world drained him of a good deal of vitality . Without his malady Beethoven would probably never have become deaf , and certainly would never have developed that group of ignoble internal troubles that ultimately wore down even his iron frame at fifty-seven . Hugo Wolf , after some days and nights of incredibly intense cerebration , would disappear for days at a time , and then emerge from the lower haunts of Vienna as broken and bedraggled as a cat after a week 's absence from home : there would follow a few days ' rest ? or rather complete exhaustion ? and then another spell of white hot creation . ( It was on one of these absences that he contracted the dire disease that first made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) No athlete who ever lived could go through what these and other artists went through and do anything like the same fine work in his own line that the artists did in theirs . Is not the conclusion irresistible that the artist 's brain and body are the greatest storehouses of energy that Nature has ever hit upon ? There is another side to the question , of course . Without his indulgence ? even his vices ? would the artist do as good work ? Would Montaigne ever have written the beautiful essay on Prayer had he not been the very human Montaigne revealed in some of the other essays ? Would Wagner ever have written  | Parsifal ' had he lived the life of a saint ? How much of an artist 's vision into the world beyond this one comes as the result of a reaction from the over-enjoyment of this ? These are questions which I leave the psychologist to thrash out with the moralist.  | zest June 1925 WHAT are we ? ' said Mr. Pecksniff , but coaches ? Some of us are slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charity . Some of us , I say ' , resumed her parent with increased emphasis , are slow coaches ; some of us are fast coaches . Our passions are the horses ; and rampant animals , too ! Really , Pa ! ' cried both daughters at once . How very unpleasant . ' And rampant animals , too ! ' repeated Mr. Pecksnijf , with so much determination that he may be said to have exhibited , at the moment , a sort of moral rampancy himself ; and Virtue is the drag . We start from The Mother 's Arms and we run to The Dust Shovel . ' When he had said this , Mr. Pecksniff , being exhausted , took some further refreshment . When he had done that , he corked the bottle tight , with the air of a man who had effectually corked the subject also ; and went to sleep for three stages . In all ages there has been an inability on the part of the Aristotelian and the Platonian , the cat and the dog , the Brahmsian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see things from the other 's point of view . Recently we have seen the two eternal opposites at warfare over the virtuoso ' conductor . The virtuoso has once more been cold-shouldered by the virtuous . There is a certain type of mind that looks with suspicion on brilliance , even on speed . This type found its most characteristic expression in the Victorian epoch , but representatives of it still survive . It regards art as a branch of morals , frowns on anything in art that does not seem to tend to virtue , and , of course , is as sure of its own virtue as it is doubtful of that of the people in the other camp . Mercy and Charity Pecksniff thought it shocking that any portion of mankind should be like a fast coach , drawn by those rampant animals , the passions ; but if such people there were in this wicked world , Virtue , in the  | person of the slow coach , felt called upon to supply the drag . In the circles of the virtuous , speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , at any rate highly suspicious . When the Victorian female wanted to express reprobation of another female , she described the latter as fast ' ; while a man who was not of the company of the virtuous would be described as going the pace ' . That was condemnation enough ; celerity was something in itself reprehensible in the eyes of the slow . A good deal of the Victorian young person has survived in our musical criticism . When one of the virtuous wants to be especially severe on a conductor , he tells us that he took liberties with the tempo ' . Took liberties with ! ' The dear old Victorian phrase ! The implication of it is that music is a sort of unprotected female who is never safe when a fast ' man is about ? particularly at night , which , as we all know , is when the virtuoso conductor is given to prowling about , seeking music that he may deflower . And in spite of myself I can not help feeling shocked when I read that a conductor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same horror as when I read , in the police-court evidence , that the body of the murdered girl was found with its clothing disarranged . I am not surprised that the virtuous cry out against the fast ' conductors who take liberties ' with music . And in public , too ! With the virtuous looking at them ! To the outsider , this eternal conflict between the virtuous and the virtuosi is very diverting . The latter have a predilection for regarding art as a personal expression ; the former look upon it as a religion , of which they are the only true high priests . The slow coach holds up his hands in pious horror at the fast coach ; the fast coach has an amused contempt for the slow coach . The musical history of the Wagner-Brahms epoch might almost be written as a conflict of opinion between the virtuous and the virtuoso . That dear old prig in petticoats , Clara Schumann , may almost stand as the supreme type of the musical virtuous . She and her associates honestly thought that they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the immoral virtuosi ; Codlin felt called upon to warn the public against the demoralisation that would be certain to follow in  | the wake of Short . When Brahms and Joachim made their famous Declaration ' against the Wagner-Liszt party in 186o , they were anxious to make it clear that musical virtue was with their party alone : they can only bewail or condemn , as against the inmost and essential nature of music , the production of the leaders and pupils of the so-called " New German " school . ' Clara Schumann lamented in her diary ( 1872 ) that this enthusiasm for Wagner seems to me a kind of disease which sweeps across a country and carries away the very best people . ' Tristan , ' she thought the most repulsive thing I ever saw or heard in my life . . . . Every feeling of decency was outraged . ... It is not emotion , it is a disease , and they tear their hearts out of their bodies , while the music expresses it all in the most repulsive manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducting the Poem of Ecstasy ' ! Joachim , for Clara , was a brilliant example of how all that is beautiful and noble in music should be expressed ' ? so different from those immoral fellows at Bayreuth , who merely exercised an intoxicating influence ' . Still , Providence ? whom the virtuous are always magnanimous enough to regard as one of themselves ? deserved credit for having sent so strong and healthy a genius as Brahms into the world in the midst of the Wagner mania . ' Liszt , of course , being a virtuoso , could not be , artistically speaking , virtuous . Clara could not deny him merit as a pianist , but it is a pity that one can get so little calm enjoyment out of it ; it is always a demoniac force that sweeps one along . ' There we have the eternal complaint of the slow coach against the fast , of the penny plain against the twopenny coloured . For Clara , demoniac ' was a self-evident term of reproach , just as brilliant ' is for some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant and sound , swift and yet steady on his feet . So much for the slow coach 's point of view . What was the point of view of the fast coaches ? Walter Bache , irritated by the claim of the virtuous to be the only authorised custodians of the classics ' , described somebody or other as a refined classical player ? Angelice , a wooden-headed brute ' . Schumann did not like Wagner 's performance of the Ninth Symphony : he almost invariably takes the tempi wrong and very often mistakes the feeling . ' But Wagner and Liszt thought as little of the virtuous  | as the virtuous thought of them . If you want to hear Schumann 's works played as they should not be played , ' said Liszt , listen to Clara . ' The virtuous regarded Beethoven ? as indeed they still do ? as their own special preserve ; what right has a virtuoso like Wagner or Liszt or Koussevitzky to intrude into the temple ? But read Wagner on the subject : I ask all who have heard , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Liszt in a private circle , what they previously knew of these creations and what they then discovered in them ' ; and he follows this up with a veiled sneer at the pretensions of Brahms and his school . In his essay On Conducting ' he resents as an impertinence the Brahmsians ' patronage of Liszt as a mere technician , and says how much he was distressed ' by the woodenness and primness of Brahms 's playing ' ; and he concludes with words that the virtuous perhaps might bear in mind when next they feel their classic purity assailed by the virtuoso : We ought to defend ourselves against having our great living Beethoven clothed for us in the garment of this Sanctity . . . as though , where they could make no difference between Beethoven and Schumann there really were no difference to make . ' Apparently the final word is not with the refined classical players ' . Those rampant animals the passions object to the drag of Virtue .  | 29th January 1922 T1E problem before all of us musicians just now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a certain amount of dissatisfaction not only with the music of the past but with the music of the present that confesses the past to be its parent . Some of our younger men feel , more or less dimly , that music can express many things that have hitherto not found expression in it , and are working out , more or less successfully , the new forms and the new technique for this expression . The critics on either side keep up a pretty tumult and shouting : the public feels vaguely that while the old kings have departed the new captains are not quite equal to their job . It hears the great composers ? or what it takes to be the great composers ? of the past and the present scolded and sneered at by this critic or that as dullards or mummies . It is true that the spectacle , to the normal music lover 's eye , is very much like that of an office boy at the War Office calling Earl Haig over the coals : but the rating is done so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is not always intelligible , is assuredly copious , that the listener can hardly help saying to himself now and then , What , after all , if there 's something in all this ? What if Haig really is wrong and the office boy right ? ' None of us can be quite sure of anything in art . In a world the very law of which is change , it can not be pronounced an utter impossibility that the B minor Mass will some day be thought very small beer in comparison with that of The NothingDoing Bar ' of Milhaud : even Chout ' may be to the next century what Tristan ' is to this . But most of us can not wait that long . If only we could find some sure touchstone that would help us to distinguish between the false metal and the true in the music of today ! We all want , so to speak , to be always backing winners : we should like to turn to these our articles twenty years hence and see that Time has proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , we can only gamble on it , giving our fancy such backing  | of stable information , such knowledge of weights and courses and jockeys , as we can . But it will certainly help us a little to delve into the past occasionally and see what has happened in circumstances that , in essentials , resembled our own . By a curious chance , I came this week , in less than five minutes , upon a couple of pieces of writing that between them present us with a problem worth pondering upon . The first is Mr. E. J. Dent 's account in the Nation of the local criticisms of the concert of English music at Prague . Quoting , apparently , from one of these notices ( or perhaps summarising several of them ) , he writes : The three English composers represented three tendencies which were little different from those of Central Europe ? Butterworth ( " The Shropshire Lad " ) making a conscious return to the simplicity of folk-song , Bliss ( the " Melee Fantasque " , I think ) the modernist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elgar ( one of the symphonies ) the Pope of music , the man of ripe experience , the conservative who has gone through the school of Liszt 's technique , and there fixes , more or less , the boundaries of music . ' This last sentence is a gem , but we must not linger too long over it : this tracing of Elgar to Liszt is as rich in its way as M. Diaghileff 's filiation of him to Brahms . They can not , of course , both be right ; but both can be , and are , ludicrously wrong . The main point of the passage is clear : Elgar represents the ripe conservative in music , Arthur Bliss the modernist ' . Which is a perfectly sound discrimination . What we have to guard against is the hasty assumption that it is the modernist ' , not the conservative , to whom people will be listening a couple of generations hence . Let us turn now to the article on A Forgotten Master ' in M. Romain Rolland 's book A Musical Tour through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued in an English translation . The very title is both ominous and paradoxical . A master ? but forgotten ! Does the world forget its masters so easily ? even its little masters ? And what shall it avail a man if his own contemporaries and a future historian or two acclaim him as a master if his work does not survive for the public ? This forgotten master , according to M. Rolland 's sub-title , was Telemann , the successful rival of J. S. Bach ' . Again our
