HUMAN SOCIETY IN ETHICS AND POLITICS ( 227 pp. ) - Bertrand Russell-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> In a seminar on leading contemporary philosophers at New York University , Professor Sidney Hook once asked his class : " What is Bertrand Russell 's philosophy ? " " Russell is a materialist , " said one student . " An idealist , " said another . " A realist , " " a rationalist , " said still others . The students quickly got the professor 's point-that there was an element of truth in each of their answers . " The next time anyone asks you , ' What is Bertrand Russell 's philosophy ? ' " Professor Hook said , " the correct answer is ' What year , please ? ' " In his 83rd year , Bertrand Arthur William , Earl Russell is busier taking up old stances than throwing fresh philosophical punches . For one brief moment in the preface of his latest book Human Society in Ethics and Politics , the old philosopher gets set to floor all previous Russells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous epigram of David Hume : " Reason is , and ought only to be , the slave of the passions . " Though he claims to believe this , Russell , like Philosopher Hume , is not entirely happy about it , and proves it by launching into his favorite fable-how sweet Grandmother Reason is gobbled up by the big bad wolf called Passion . <P> Leviticus Says No . He tells the story , wittily and well , by putting the problem of ethics on a kind of analyst 's couch and dredging up its troubled case history . The childhood of ethics , in the Russell view , is taboo . Taboo morality is a strict black-and-white affair filled with dread and sanctions , the ethics of primitive man . <P> Taboo lingers on , Russell feels , in the popular objections to euthanasia and birth control . Russell asks : " Suppose atomic bombs had reduced the population of the world to one brother and sister ; should they let the human race die out ? I do not know the answer , but I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that incest is wicked . " The problem of ethics grows as it is touched by religion . Biblical authority , says Russell , is sometimes contradictory : " Should a childless widow marry her deceased husband 's brother ? Leviticus says no , Deuteronomy says yes ( Leviticus 20 : 21 ; Deuteronomy 25:5 ) . " Knowledge Is Virtue . An unswerving atheist , Russell is convinced that all faiths do harm . " He defines faith as a firm belief in something for which there is no evidence . " The code of ethics with which Russell would like to supplant the traditional code ironically demands a good deal of faith . The concepts of good and " bad " says Russell , should replace those of " right " and " wrong . " A good act would be one in which the " intrinsic value to the individual is most compatible with the general good of mankind . <P> Essentially , Russell 's Utopia is a strongly determinist Garden of Eden where knowledge is virtue and no one has enough free will to choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of danger in the world , but he offers to charm them with never-never tunes that have become more conventional than convincing : 1 ) world government ; 2 ) world prosperity 3 ) worldwide birth control ; 4 ) more individual initiative and decentralization of economic and political power .
