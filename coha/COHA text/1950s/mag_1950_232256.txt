In some ways , Dean Harry J , Carman of Columbia College , * Columbia University was a very odd sort of dean . He was a baggily dressed man with a Yankee twang and white hair that always seemed ruffled . He called distinguished visitors " you dear folks , " said " peoples " when he meant " people " ; and his eminent colleague , Historian Jacques Barzun , he insisted on calling Jake . <P> In summer he would vanish to his farm in upstate New York to mend roofs , trudge through the mud and bargain at cattle auctions . In spring he played on a campus softball team known as Carman 's Indians . He himself often wondered whether he was the type for " deaning . " " Here , " he once said of himself , " is a good dirt farmer gone wrong . " <P> But Columbia College found nothing wrong about him . A onetime Rhinebeck , N.Y . high-school principal , he first went to Columbia in 1917 , quickly rose to professor of history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lumbering slowly back &; forth across his platform , arms folded across his chest , he had a way of making history come alive without resorting to flashy dramatics . Students flocked to hear him and seven times voted him their most popular prof essor . In 1943 , when Columbia College needed a new dean , President Nicholas Murray Butler picked Carman . <P> Over the years , gentle Harry Carman , peering genially through his steel-rimmed glasses , helped revolutionize Columbia education . He was one of a small group of scholars who , after World War I , first sounded the alarm against the U.S. college curriculum . It was too much of a jumble , they said , a hodgepodge of overlapping courses , free electives and overspecialization . Its products were so one-sided that they could not even talk to each other . <P> Gradually , Columbia hit upon a solution : it divided its curriculum into three basic fields-the humanities and the social and natural sciences-and required freshmen and sophomores to explore all three . " A false ' specialization ' that chooses to neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is like a three-legged stool with only two legs . " <P> In time , other colleges began to agree . By last week , as 65-year-old Harry Carman reached the retirement age for " deaning , " Columbia 's three-legged stool had been copied on campuses throughout the U.S. " Let 's not forget Montaigne 's admonition , " Carman once advised : " ' The object of education is to make , not a scholar , but a man . ' " If U.S. colleges had begun to make less lopsided men , it was partly because of Dean Carman . <P> <P> - Undergraduate men 's college of Columbia University .
