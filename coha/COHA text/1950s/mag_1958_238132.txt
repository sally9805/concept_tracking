In his orange Cadillac with leopard-skin upholstery , Dogpatch ( Okla . ) Dance Hall Owner James Clifton Hawkins picked up Lola Fay Moudy , 17 , a waitress in a Dogpatch tavern , one night in November 1955 . He drove her to nearby Mena , Ark. to have a headlight fixed , then took her to Tulsa , Okla. and set her up in the world 's oldest profession . Hawkins soon found that he had made one big mistake : by transporting Lola Fay across a state line for immoral purposes , he had violated the federal Mann Act ; he was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison . But last week the U.S. Supreme Court found that the prosecution had made an even bigger mistake : it had summoned Hawkins ' estranged wife , a prostitute who had taken Lola Fay in hand , to testify against him . <P> The question before the Supreme Court : May a wife , even voluntarily , testify against her husband in a case where no injury to herself is involved ? The point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law once barred a defendant from testifying either for or against himself ; because spouses were considered legally indivisible , common law prohibited one from testifying for or against the other . In the Supreme Court 's words , " reason and experience " have mostly wiped out the historic basis for the rule . Defendants , although constitutionally privileged not to testify against themselves in criminal cases , can certainly take the stand on their own behalf . Spouses are no longer considered a legal unit . Indeed , by act of Congress , one spouse is now allowed to testify against the other in cases of bigamy , polygamy , unlawful cohabitation , etc . <P> Such changes left a need for reclarifying the rule about spouses testifying against each other-and the Supreme Court undertook that reclarification in a unanimous opinion by Justice Hugo Black ( with the court 's newest member , Justice Potter Stewart , 43 , concurring , even while calling the rule anachronistic ) . <P> " The basic reason the law has refused to pit wife against husband or husband against wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wrote Black , " was a belief that such a policy is necessary to foster family peace , not only for the benefit of husband , wife and children , but for the benefit of the public as well . " So saying , the court in effect freed James Clifton Hawkins , ironically building a monument to home and hearth out of the relationship of two whores and a pimp.
