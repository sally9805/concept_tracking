The first of three stories by LEO ROSTEN Drawings by Karla Kuskin H*Y*M - *A* N K*A. * L*A* N , EVER EUMOIROUS I T HAD all begun so innocently . Only when the fume and foam of conflict had settled , many hours later , far , far from the fierce battleground of the beginners ' grade of the American Night Preparatory School for Adults , was Mr. Parkhill able to retrace the steps through which he had unwittingly opened that strange Pandora 's Box . Yet how could he have known ? What could he have done ? How had it begun ? It had begun , he supposed , when Stanislaus Wilkomirski , a steadfast but unpredictable student , delivered himself of a composition entitled " Why Horses Die All Over . " The very first sentence of that surprising essay read : Horses are slower as autmobiles , and whose use makes horses die . Mr. Parkhill 's practiced eye seized upon that " and . " It was a perfect example of the superfluous conjunction , that grammatical misdemeanor which Professor Otto J. Horkheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aptly called " thwarted subordination . " Mr. Parkhill tapped the errant " and " with his pointer and explained how , in implying equality between the two clauses , " and " actually vitiated the subordination Mr. Wilkomirski had obviously intended . " If we simply remove the ' and ' , " said Mr. Parkhill , suiting action to thought with a deft swipe of the eraser , " the relationship be-tween the two ideas is corrected . " He paused . " Automobiles do not cause horses to  --  er  --  die , Mr. Wilkomirski . Did you not mean to say that the automobile replaces the horse ? " Mr. Wilkomirski had no qualms about concurring that the automobile replaces , rather than murders , the horse . " Does anyone see a misspelled word in that sentence ? " Mr. Parkhill asked , rather more pointedly than was his wont . Miss Mitnick  --  earnest , shy , reliable Rose Mitnick  --  raised her hand . " ' Automobile . ' That 's spelled wrong . Should be an ' o ' between ' t ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled Mr. Parkhill , and inserted an " o " between the " t " and the " m . " And that , it turned out , was the fatal moment . Yes , that innocuous " o " was the spark that triggered a chain reaction such as even the beginners ' grade in its stormiest hour had never known . For " automobile , " with its Greek and Latin origins , offered Mr. Parkhill a perfect opportunity to give his students a glimpse of etymology , to show them , as Professor Horkheimer had so often stressed , how to make use of languages other than English , languages which , as adults , they already knew and from which they could draw priceless roots and parallels . " Can anyone tell me why there should be an ' o ' after the T ? " asked Mr. Parkhill. 36 HYMAN KAPLAN , EVER EUMOIROUS Up went the hand of Hyman Kaplan . " Y-yes ? " said Mr. Parkhill cautiously . " Becawss dat 's de vay it 's spallcd ! " beamed Hyman Kaplan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That , Mr. Kaplan , " he said crossly , " does not help a bit . " " Becawss ye nidd a vowel to squeeze in de sand ' o ' ? " Mr. Kaplan tried again . Mr. Parkhill gripped the chalk firmly . " Nano . " He made a stroke to separate " auto " from " mobile . " " Notice , class : ' Automobile ' consists of two parts , ' auto ' and ' mobile ' . The first happens to come from Creek , the second from Latin . Now each of these has a specific meaning . ' Mobile ' means moving . ' Auto ' is Greek for ? " " Yos ! Yos ! " Recognition leaped from the throat of Gus Matsoukas , overjoyed by the appearance , so far from Ithaca , of a childhood friend . ' " Auto ' ? dot means myself ! " " Exactly , " said Mr. Parkhill , quite pleased . " ' Automobile ' means ' self-moving , ' moving under its own power , from the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Moskowitz in horror . To Mrs. Moskowitz , English was mystery and torment enough ; the one thing it did not need was foreign aid-in-confusion from yet another tongue . " Did the Griks invant automobills ? " asked Oscar Trabish incredulously . " I thought the foist mechines came diract froM Ditroit , by Hanry Fort ? " " Not ! " Mr. Matsoukas thundered , " ' Automobile ' is Grik ! ' Airplane ' is Grik ! ' Telephone ' is Grik ! All , all , all Grik ! ! " Nationalism , which never lay more than a few inches beneath the smoldering surface of the beginners ' grade , now raced through the room like brush fire . " Matsoukas , leave a few screps for other nations ! " shouted Mr. Pinsky . " Talephones came from Alexander Grayhond Bell ! " averred Cookie Kipnis . ( Miss Kipnis ' first name was Clara , but it pleased her no end to be called " Cookie . " ) " Airplanes are from U. S. , " chirped tiny Mrs. Tomasic , touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Parkhill . " Mr. Matsoukas did not mean that the Greeks actually invented all these wonderful devices . He meant that the words used to  --  er  --  name them are Greek in origin , " " Aahh . " drifted through the room like an elegy . " Oooh ... " murmured many in the flush of comprehension . " Ahar cried Hyman Kaplan , who scorned half-measures . Respectful faces turned to Mr. Matsoukas , tendering him , as plenipotentiary , the admiration his forebears so richly deserved . As for the man from Greece , transformed from scapegoat to savant in the twinkling of an eye , he relapsed into his habitual mutterings and assumed an expression that left no doubt in anyone 's mind that the proud people who had given mankind Aristotle and Plato , physics and philosophy , could just as easily have invented the telephone , the airplane , and heaven knows what else had they but thought it worth applying their minds to such childish ends . This was too much for Miss Caravello , whose tribal amour-propre was easily offended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she demanded with passion . " Da Music ? Da Church ? Leonardo ? " Miss Caravello might have gone on for quite a while cataloguing the grandeurs of Rome had not even this brief sampling stung Olga Tar-nova 's heritage to the quick . " Rossia , Rossia ! " Miss Tarnova moaned in heartfelt accents . " Tolstoy . Lermontov . Chakhov . Pushk ? " " Michelangelo ! Rossini ! Dante ! " " Ladies , ladies , " said Mr. Parkhill , tapping his pointer on the desk , " we can dispense with such heated dialogue .. . . " " Also Grikl " cried Gus Matsoukas . " Mr. Paikhill ? " Mr. Scymzak could not believe his ears . " ' Dialogue ' is Grik , not teacher , " snorted Mr. Ma tsoukas . " Ha come you know so much Grik and so little English ? " asked Mr. Pinsky in amazement . " Because he is a man of high culture ! " snapped Reuben Plonsky , who never missed an opportunity to deflate Mr. Kaplan 's first grenadier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jost happens Matsoukas got born in Grik ? " " ' Greece , ' Mr. Kaplan , not Grik ' . " " ? so for dat he desoives spacial cradit ? T'ink , Plonsky . Use your bren ! Averyhody got to loin sum lengvidgc . Grik is Matsoukas ' molder 's tong . Dat kine culture , anyvun got ! " He turned to Mr. Pinsky . " Pinsky , show . Spik a few voids Rumanian . " Stout Pinsky uttered a few words in Rumanian . " Studniczka ! " Mr. Kaplan summoned a second underling . " Give a sample . " Peter Studniczka uttered cryptic syllables from some indecipherable , but no doubt ancient , tongue . " Gidvitz , say a few voids ? " B U T Mr. Parkhill was drumming his pencil on his desk most resolutely . That will do , Mr. Kaplan . Quiet , please . . . Everyone . . . Suppose we return to ' automobile. : I was merely trying to point out that English is  --  er  --  a living language . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding new words , new shadings ? ' " Oy , " moaned Mrs. Moskowitz . Poor Mrs. Moskowitz . To her , words were like glaciers , or the oceans ; they had always been there . To suggest that new words were being spawned right and left around her  --  that , to Mrs. Moskowitz , was opening the gates to bedlam itself . " Let 's take another word , " said Mr. Parkhill quickly . He turned to the hoard , where he printed : AUTOGRAPH " Now , class , we saw that ' auto ' refers to self . Does anyone know what ' graph ' means ? " " Matsoukas , tell , " Mr. Kaplan sighed . " You de only Grik in de cless . " " ' Greek , ' Mr. Kaplan. not Grik ' . " Mr. Matsoukas knit his brows . " ' Graph ' . . Yost ' Grapho . ' Write . " " Good ! " said Mr. Parkhill. - Therefore , ' autograph ' means one 's own writing , one 's signature . Now do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were staggered . " Oooh . " crooned Miss Tarnova . " Hadaya like that ? " " Claver ! " " Please , give more examples ! " " There are many , many more examples , " said Mr. Parkhill cheerfully , heartened by the response of his charges . He thought for a moment . " Here is a word which may strike you as  --  erhard ; yet I 'm sure all of you have seen it , dozens of times . " On the board , he printed : HOMOGENIZED Uncertain murmurs , accompanied by baffled expressions , ascended from the ranks of the seated . " Here is a hint  --  to the ladies , " said Mr , Parkhill . " Whenever you go into a market , I am sure you see ? " He touched " homogenized . " " Thai ? " cried Mrs. Yanoff . " Never . " A STORY " Who shops in a zoo ? " asked Cookie Kipnis . " How we can buy something we ca n't pronounce ? " Miss Goldberg reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dismayed . " Think hard , class . I assure you that you have all seen this very word . Many times . Does anyone have a clue ? " The lone hand of Rose Mitnick rose once more . " Does n't this mean , " she blushed , " a certain kind milk ? " " It certainly does ! " said Mr. Parkhill heartily . " Homogen ? " " Milk ! " cried Miss Gidwitz . " Ufcawss ! " " Soitinlyt " " Goodness sek ! " mused Miss Ziev , making a note that would enliven many a dinner table . " I knew you would recognize it , " beamed Mr. Parkhill . " Now , ' homogenized ' will take on a much richer meaning once we understand what its separate parts mean . " He raised his chalk and bisected " homogenized . " " ' Homo ' means ' like , ' ' the same . " Genos ' refers to ' type ' or ' kind . ' Homogenized milk , therefore , is milk which is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You mean I am drinking Grik milk ? " exclaimed Mrs. Moskowitz scandalized . " Grik milk is from goats ! " growled Mr. Matsoukas . " I am not a goat ! " " You not a cow eider , " said Mr. Kaplan sternly , " still you drink Amarican milk ! " T ' 1 ' HIS point , Carmen Caravello , who was becoming increasingly antipathetic to the Helene , broke in to ask Mr. Parkhill whether Greek was the only language which had enriched the Anglo-Saxon ; had not a certain other noble tongue endowed its linguistic treasures to English ? Through both her question and her intonation , which suggested an overheated diplomat delivering an icy demarche , Miss Caravello practically accused Mr. Parkhill of playing favorites among the nations . " Latin , " Mr. Parkhill agreed at once , " has 38 HYMAN KAPLAN , EVER EU probably contributed even more words to English than Greek has . " " Bravo , " said Miss Caravello simply . " Still anodder lengvidge ? " moaned Mrs. Moskowitz . " My nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doctor . " " Suppose we try a few words with Latin roots . " On the board , Mr. Parkhill printed : POSTPONE " Now , ' post ' means ' after , ' and ' pone ' comes from ' pono ' ? ' place . ' So ' post-pone ' means ? " " Tea ! " came an eager voice . Mr. Parkhill stopped short . " I beg your pardon ? " " Tea ! " It was Reuben Plonsky , glaring through his hi-locals . " A Chinese woid . " " Oh , I see what you mean . Why , yes . ' Tea ' is , I believe , from the Chinese ? " " Zwieback ! " Mr. Parkhill coughed . " I beg ? " " Zwieback ! " Mr. Guttman insisted . " From Chermany ! " " Yes ? " " Menalife , " mused Mr. Kaplan , posed like Rodin 's Thinker . " Are n't any voids in English Fromm England ? " " England ? Pah ! " throbbed Olga Tarnova , all scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honkers . Rossia ! Rossia gives beautifulest words . " That was all that was needed to rouse those who carried the Mediterranean in their blood . " Per canto ! " " Rossian . . " sneered Mrs. Rodriguez . " Give example ! " challenged Mr. Matsoukas . " Blintzes ! " retorted Olga Tarnova . " Caliviari Vodka ! " " Dose are names , not voids ! " protested Mr. Kaplan . " Tchaikowsky ! Blini ! Borscht ! " " Miss Tarnova ? " " All , all Rossian ! " " But dey stay Rossian ! " stormed Mr. Kaplan . " Ve vant voids which Less from vun lengvidge into : madder . Kipp your borscht an ' blintzes ! Can you homoornize somting in Rossian ? " ( Mr. MOIR() US Matsoukas gave the Athenian equivalent of " Hear , hear . " ) " Did Rossian name a telephone , a hot drink , iven a cold sneck ? " " Class ? " " You are prajudiced against Rossia ! " railed Miss Tarnova . " He'sa jalous Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broad-mind , " Miss Mitnick put in plaintively . " Mr. Kaplan , you are not inter-national ? " " Ha ! " cried Mr. Kaplan with the zest of yore , then struck home : " I 'm not a Chinaman eider , but I did n't objact to Plonsky 's ' tea ' ! " Mr. Parkhill was frowning so severely , and rapping his pointer so sternly , that he stilled the inflamed factions by sheer will . " We really most not let ourselves be carried away by our emotions , class . Nothing is to be gained by theseer  --  exchanges . We are here to study , not argue . " Stigmata of shame appeared on the features of his followers . " Since some of us seem to feel so intensely about this , " he remarked dryly , " I suggest that those of you who wish to may bring to our next session a brief list of words you recognize as being of  --  er  --  foreign derivation . " A N D that was how it had begun . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parting words would open the dikes to a flood ? For that was precisely the way Mr. Parkhill felt now  --  flooded , inundated by wave upon wave of words , names , roots , prefixes , suffixes , rolling across the classroom from distant and exotic shores . No sooner had he finished calling the roll than Mrs. Rodriguez , who must have con-suited half the Spanish-speaking population of New York , started rattling off words of Hispanic vintage tike a machine gun , beginning with " arena , " ending with " tobacco , " and including at least five extrapolations of " cigar . " Mrs. Rodriguez had scarcely run out of breath before Mr. 11/Tatsoukas , who seemed to have plundered Homer and Euripides , began flinging gems from the Aegean before the barbarians . No sooner had the dust settled in Mr. Matsoukas ' path than Carmen Caravello was pouring out melodious syllables culled from the Tyrol to Calabria . And before her last , ringing echoes had died in the fervent air , Olga Tarnova , bosom heaving , bracelets jangling , eyes smoldering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been murdered in 1917 , as far as Miss Tarnova was concerned ) , began to intone her Slavic litany . Never had Mr. Parkhill seen anything like it . Mr. Guttman followed Miss Tarnova with proud extracts from the tongue of Goethe , ranging from " edelweiss " to " pumpernickel . " Mrs. Tomasic donated several reverent vocables from some Balkan clime , which , since no one could understand them , joined the ranks of English without challenge . Mr. Trabish offered two words which bore Israel 's proud imprimatur , " kibitzer " and " mish-mash , " to which Cookie Kipnis , a more fastidious spirit , added " babel , " " bagel , " and " lox . " Mr. Wilkomirski nobly rose above the call of Poland to present words from three languages in which he had not the slightest vested interest : " carnival , " " whiskey , ' ' " omelette . " The room was beginning to resemble the Olympic Games . Now Hyman Kaplan , who had remained surprisingly mute throughout the etymological parade , managed to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of " Psst Psst " s , supported by an obbligato of humming , and a beseeching mooniness of visage which implied that he might die on the spot unless recognized . It proved unnecessary for Mr. Parkhill to do so , because Mr. Kaplan , divining the intent , anticipated the act : He leaped to his feet with a triumphant " Han Kay ! " , smiled his most radiant smile , announced " Have I got beauriful voids ! " , bestowed a pitying glance upon those whom , through shrewd silence , he had seduced into preceding him ( Mr. Kaplan had the instincts of a Belasco where timing was concerned ) , and strode front and center . All the other students had recited from their seats , Mr. Parkhill observed ; but to ask Mr. Kaplan to renounce the spotlight , or forfeit the advantages which accrue to an erect speaker addressing a semi-recumbent audience , was like asking Jupiter to abandon Olympus . " Francis , fallow-students , all-Amaricansl " Mr. Kaplan beamed . ( Mr. Pinsky promptly returned it with compound interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Becawss we are all-Amaricans . Vhy Ye are ill-Amaricans ? Ha ! Bccawss only in a school in vunderful Amarica could Ye see soch pride e in accomplishments fromm odder nations ! In dis megnificent etmosphere ? " " Mr. Kaplan , " Mr. Parkhill broke in , " this is not an exercise in Recitation and Speech . " Mr. Kaplan blinked his eyes . " Who denies ? " " Then may 1 suggest you simply present your foreign words ? " " I should n't give beckgrond remocks ? " Mr. Kaplan looked like Apollo being asked to discard his lyre . " No , " said Mr. Parkhill , quite frostily . " There is no need whatever for background , not grond , ' remarks , not ' remocks ' . Just write your words on the blackboard . " Mr. Kaplan might just as well have been cashiered out of the regiment . He glanced upward , regarding the heavens , appealing to the goddess with the blindfold , picked up a piece of chalk , released a sigh which wedded injury to innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbearance , and , with a brave lift of the eyebrows , printed nine letters on the board : FUMOIROUS Mr. Parkhill felt as if he were in an elevator whose cable has snapped . Mr. Kaplan surveyed his lessers blandly , the epitome of nonchalance , as they gaped at " eumoirous " in astonishment . " Vh.at ? " That was outraged Blattberg . " Is that a word or a disease ? ! " That was angry Scyrnzak . " Some people got a noive like gall-stones ! " That was seething Yanoff . " Mr. Kaplan , " began Mr. Parkhill , then paused to clear his throat . " I  --  er ? " Mr. Kaplan did not shift his feet , his gaze , or his savoir-faire by so much as a centimeter . " Fake ! A fake void ! " That was righteous Plonsky . " Watch out for his treeks ! " That was callous Tarnova . " ' Eumoi ? ' oyl " That was Mrs. Moskowitz . " Class . . . " Mr. Parkhill felt miserable . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no student had ever brought into the classroom , from the world beyond , a word he could not explain : Mr. Kaplan had bagged a specimen Mr. Parkhill could not even recognize . His eyes bored into the nine letters before him . What an ungainly word , an outlandish word , a Grecian freak . Mr. Parkhill doubted that the Greeks themselves had ever used it . " Eumoirous . . eumoirous . . " It raced through Mr. Parkhill 's head , faster and faster , like a player in musical chairs frantically hunting for a seat . What could it mean ? The prefix , of course , meant " good " ; and " moir " ? perhaps from " moira " ? had something to do with destiny . 40 HYMAN KAPLAN , EVER EUMOIROUS " Euphorious " popped into his mind . Could Mr. Kaplan possibly have meant " euphorious " instead of " elm oirous " ? There was , after all , a good deal about Mr. Kaplan that was emphatically euphorious . " Where you got such crazy word ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Kaplan raised a regal arm and with the most careless of smiles pointed to the stand on which Webster 's Unabridged Dictionary reposed . " Dere . " Mr. Pinsky gave an admiring cry . " Son Keplen , ha ? " he chortled to one and all . Mr. Plonsky put his head between his hands and moaned . " Mr. Kaplan , " said Mr. Parkhill carefully , " suppose you tell us what that word  --  cr  --  means . " " It 's Grik , " said Mr. Kaplan . This laconicism only increased the ire of his foes , who were not to be hamstrung tonight . " Noo ? " " Answer ! " " Do n't dock the quastionl " " Mr. Kaplan , " frowned Mr. Parkhill , " we do not doubt that your word is Greek . But that is not what I asked you . I want to know what the word means . " " Do n't you know ? " asked Mr. Kaplan in astonishment . " No , " said Mr. Parkhill firmly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a teacher , were heinous sins . And yet , die moment he uttered the fatal negative , Mr. Parkhill re gretted it . He regretted it for two reasons : ( I ) he had walked right into an ambush , in which Mr. Kaplan had cunningly transferred the burden of elucidation from his own shoulders to Mr. Parkhill 's , and ( 2 ) the whole class was stating at him  --  their Solomon , their Solon  --  as if the very foundations upon which education rested were crumbling before their eyes . " Teacher do n't know a word ? " asked Stanislaus Wilkomirski , dazed . " A foreigner can stomp an American-born ? " asked Miss Ziev , aghast . ( She kept fingering her engagement ring , as if to remind herself that not all was lost . ) " Mr. Parkhill . . . " Wan Miss Mitnick , bewildered , could say no more . They were like believers whose shaman has lost his powers of divination ; passengers on a storm-tossed ship whose captain has just confessed a total ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted his spec --  acles , fighting for time . " Let us not make mountains out of molehills . No one knows or uses all the words in English . There are , after all , half a million words in the language ? " ( A " Gewalt ! " came from Mrs. Moskowitz , whose nerves collapsed at half-a-hundred. ) " ? and no one can possibly keep all of them in his head . That , in fact , is one of the reasons we have dictionaries ! " He saw relief creep into Mr. Pinsky 's features , life return to Miss Mitnick 's cheeks . The tide was turning in his favor . His sheep were regaining their shepherd . " Now , Mr. Kaplan , " he said sternly , " will you please proceed ? Define eumoirous ' . " S TRANGELY enough , Mr. Kaplan did not look ecstatic , as might be expected in one who had achieved the unprecedented feat of stumping Mr. Parkhill . Mr. Kaplan did not even look content . He looked wretched . Ile looked like Boswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Kaplan consulted a slip of paper , from which he dolorously read : " ' Eumoirous . Adjectiva ' .. . It minus : ' Heppy or fortunate fromm de goodness of vun 's inclinations and actions ' . " He lowered the paper . A censorious hiss slithered forth from Olga Tarnova . " Shame , shame on such a word ! " " I would n't make Mr. Parkhill troubles ! " averred Miss Pomeranz . " Give yourself already a diploma and graduate from the school ! " called Mr. Plonsky caustically , from between his hands . Not a retort or demurrer or riposte came from Hyman Kaplan 's lips . He stood in stoic silence . " Well , class , " Mr. Parkhill began , " Mr. Kaplan has brought us a  --  er  --  most rare word . " Mr. Plonsky turned to Mr. Pinsky tauntingly . " What 's a matter , corporal , why you look pale ? You are maybe ashamed of General Keplen ? " " Criticize Keplen , not Pinsky ! " flared Mr. Kaplan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woid ? " " Keplen is prod , not ashamed ! " retorted Hyman Kaplan . " How ye vill loin if ye do n't try de onusual ? ! " " Your woid is not ( ) mistral : it is onbelievable ! " bellowed Mr. Blattberg . " So blame Grik , not Keplen ! " shrugged his scourge . " Gentlemen ? " " You not fair , Mr. Kaplan , " wailed Miss Mitnick . " Mr. Parkhill. wanted words would help , not confuse ? " " Som pipple , " said Mr. Kaplan , narrowing his eyes , " can dron in a gless of vater ! " " But all others in class gave useful words ? " " Aducation does n't have to be useful ! " " Mr. Kap . . " " But in a hundred years we would n't use a word like ' eumoirous ' ! " complained Miss Mitnick tearfully . " Could heppen an occasion vill arise to som student who might use ' eumoirous ' any minute ! " " The day you use this cuckoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly and alephants sing ! " " Kcplcn , " said Mr. Kaplan loftily , " is not risponsible for de eninial kinkdom . " Mr. Plonsky began talking to himself . " Mr. Kaplan ! " Mr. Parkhill did not even try to soften his tone . " I must say I entirely agree with Miss Mitnick and Mr. Plonsky . Your word is most obscure . It is , I might say , close to being ? er  --  archaic . After all , good English is simple English . The purpose of words is to communicate , not to impress . " As Mr. Parkhill went on , warming to his task , Mr. Kaplan 's features began to sag , like wax under heat . He had expected Mr. Parkhill to praise him for discovering so rare a creature as " eumoirous , " perhaps even cite him for audacity in bringing it to bay . Instead . Launcelot , sorely besieged , discovered King Arthur leading the Saracens . ? " Now let us turn to an exercise on dangling participles , " Mr. Parkhill picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaplan . . . " That crushed spirit had remained rooted to the scene of his disaster , " You  --  er  --  may resume your seat . " For the rest of the evening , Mr. Kaplan sat silent , stunned , wrapped in desolation . Great Achilles had retired to the tent of pride , and within it  --  who knew his thoughts ? Only as the hour of departure drew nigh did Mr. Kaplan bestir himself  --  and then it was only to bend head over notebook , and , without sound or sign , write steadily . The terminal bell tolled , " Good night , Mr. Parkhill . " " Good evening . " " Goot-by . " The warriors filed out of the room , weary but enlightened , trailing the familiar pleasantries of farewell . Mr. Parkhill collected his books and papers . He noticed that Mr. Kaplan was still seated , writ* . Mr. Parkhill made a little more noise than necessary in closing his desk drawer . Mr. Kaplan rose . " Coot night . " He said it with great dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The portal closed . Mr. Parkhill leaned back in his chair and massaged his temples . It had been a trying evening , a most trying night . He felt vexed . Greek and Roman roots had promised so much .... He remembered that Professor Horkheimer had written an entire and excellent chapter on " Words to Aid Us from Foreign Lands " ? but Professor Horkheimer had obviously never been obliged to confront a certain kind of problem , or contend with a certain kind of student . Mr. Parkhill noticed a paper on his desk . It was an ordinary sheet of foolscap , folded once . He unfolded it . Something was written on it , upside down . He turned it right side up , and read : Dear Mr. Parkhill Tonight I disagreet with you . Still , you are the best teacher . If I do n't learn from you , I wo n't learn from anyone . ( singed ) Hyman Kaplan p.s . Tonight you should feel eumoirous . That was just like Mr. Kaplan ! To find a way , however strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the last and incontestable word . " Eumoirous . . . Happy from the goodness of one 's inclinations and actions . " Well , Mr. Parkhill did not feel at all eumoirous . He put on his coat and hat before some echo of meaning , some delayed awareness of incongruity , made him pause . " Singed , Hyman Kaplan . " Why , for the first time in all the hundreds of times he had written his proud signature in the beginners ' grade of the American Night Preparatory School for Adults , Mr. Kaplan had spelled his name without stars ! Without colors . Without red letters outlined in blue and garnished with stars of green ! Mr. Parkhill frowned . He picked up the foolscap page again . On the underside of the fold , which he had not seen before , was printed : T MIL P-44 ) 4-C344.4*-4 , As he snapped the lights out , Mr. Parkhill wondered whether in all the years he hoped lay before him , he would ever again be so honored . He felt eumoirous.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
