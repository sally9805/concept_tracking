txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** Senate today unanimously passed a new anti-Communist resolution . Then it plunged into bitter debate during which Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was ' twice ordered to take his seat for impugning the sincerity of other Senators . The Wisconsin Republican ( touched off the hour-long wrangle when he declared that some Democratic Senators who voted for the resolution were insincere in their support . He then broadened his attack to include the entire Democratic patty . The party , he said , was still controlled by " the same group of men responsible for twenty dreary years of the Harry Dexter White type of ? treason . " ' Some of the Senators who voted for the resolution were " only interested in getting the stench from their skirts and the mud from their hands , " he declared . The Senator 's comments became such that Senator Russell B. Long , Democrat of Louisiana , who was presiding in the absence of Vice President Richard M. Nixon , twice declared he had violated Senate rules , which forbid impugning the motives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender the floor . Supported by Welker The first time , ? Senator McCarthy did so , but was permitted to continue on the motion of one of his most faithful supporters , Senator Herman Welker , Republican of Idaho . The second time , he had already stopped talking and , was seated when the gavel fell . Shortly before Se.iator McCarthy began his attack , he and , eighty-three colleagues had joined in voting their approval of a resolution introduced by Senator Price Daniel , Democrat of Texas , and fifty-three co-sponsors . It served notice that Senate committees would " diligently and vigorously " continue the drive to root out Communist subversion . Senator McCarthy 's attack was his first since the Senate voted 67 to 22 last December to condemn his previous actions . In addition to the late Harry Dexter White , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury identified by the Justice Department and tile .6'ederal Bureau of ' Investigation as a Communist , the Wisconsin Senator singled out as targets former President Truman and Dean Acheson , former Secretary of State . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel and Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virgina . ' But , he said , the " TrumanAcheson branch of the party certainly has coddled , co'ered up and nutured treason . " Senator ** declared he was " not too hopeful " that the Democrats would continue the anti-Communist campaign he started as chairman of the Permanent Senate Subcommittee on Investigations in the EightyThird Congress . Hesaid it would be " an about-face , back-tracking " if they cid . " I hope the Democratic party is ready to make an about-face , " he declared . " It would be a great thing for the country . But I ca n't // help thinkingiabout the man who made speeches against liquor , and then got drunk every night . " Senator McCarthy said he thought the case of Rejresentative Martin Dies , Democrat of Texas , supported his misgivings . Mr. Dies , first chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives , retired from public life for several years and then returned to Congress as Representative at Large . He applied this year for membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative Edwin tE . Willis , Democrat of Louisiana , who had seniority . " The leadership of the Democratic party said ' We do n't put you on that committee , ' because they knew Martin Dies would n't trifle with Communists , " Senator McCarthy declared . " It was part of the continued attempt to break Martin Dies . " Senator Daniel , taking the floor in defense of his party , said he was more hopeful than Senator McCarthy that vigorous investigations would continue . He objected to the Wisconsin Senator 's blanket indictment of the party . Resolution a ' Gesture ' Senator McCarthy rejoined that he was not criticizing Senator Daniel . He said , however , that Senator Daniel and others like him did not " control " the Democratic party , and he termed the resolution a " polite gesture , " a " pious resolution . " " Some who voted for it were trying to get the dirt off their hands , " he declared . It was at this point that Senator Long ruled ' him out of order the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brought Senator Welker roaring to his feet to move that Senator McCarthy be permitted to " continue in order , " as the Senate rules provide . When the motion was put , Senator Welker and Senator Wil'Ham E. Jenner , Republican of ( Indiana , bellowed , " Aye ! " No other audible comment was heard ( from the handful of Republicans land Democrats in attendance at ( the time . Enough ' Silliness ' Senator McCarthy then remarked bitterly that Senator Long had not objected last fall during the censure debate " when I was accused of everything except murdering my own grandmother . " Senator Welker chimed in that Senator Long had not been so concerned about the rules " during the terrible tragedy we had here in the Senate a couple of months ago . " " We 've had enough silliness in this body , " Senator Welker declared . . Senator Thomas C. Kuchel , Republican of California , who voted last December against the resolution to condemn Senator McCarthy , rose to say that " as a Republican and one who respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulate Senator Long for ordering Senator McCarthy to take his seat . Senator McCarthy retorted that he appreciated " this outburst of righteous indignation . " Senator Kuchel demanded that he be ordered to take his seat again , Assoc. , . Press Senator Russell B. Long but after a moment thought better of it and permitted Senator McCarthy to continue . He said , however , that he thought the time had come " when we ought not to indulge in personal animadversions on the Senate floor no matter what the subject is . " No Halos , He Says Senator McCarthy retorted that " no halos surround these thrones . " " I am fully and completely convinced , " he cried , " that . there are those who signed that resolution who are not interested in digging out Communists . They are only interested in getting the stench from their skirts and the mud from their hands . " It was then that Senator Long ordered him to be seated ' again , but he already sat down . Later Senator Long explained that his orders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat that he was " getting more and more disturbed by the theory that a halo surrounds these thrones . " The debate ended with one last jibe by Senator McCarthy at " the Democratic party -- or perhaps I I should say ' the Truman party . ' "
