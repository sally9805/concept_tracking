Seventh-Day Adventists , meeting in fall council in Washington , listened with pride to reports of fresh church growth and activity . Adventists now have some 900,000 baptized members throughout the world , who contributed $56 million in offerings last year , helped support 2,000 foreign missionaries .

The Cape Town Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church officially viewed with alarm a report that Roman Catholics had dedicated " South Africa and its people " to the " Blessed Virgin Mary Assumed into Heaven . " Also alarmed at Catholic growth in South Africa ( e.g. , 170,000 Catholics of white or mixed race , 660,000 Negroes , 60 hospitals which recognize no color bar ) , the synod instructed church members to " withhold all support of Roman Catholic hospitals and other institutions for the sake of maintaining the Protestant faith in South Africa . " <P> The Arizona Synod of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. ( Northern ) faced up to a ticklish question after Governor J. Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban on the sale of liquor to Indians , as a step in establishing full civil rights for them ? " I do n't see how any Christian can say anything to the liquor traffic but ' No ! ' " cried the Rev. E. P. Smith , missionary from the Navaho reservation . But after short , sharp debate ( and a score of abstentions ) , the synod recommended lifting the ban . Vote : 27 to 21.
