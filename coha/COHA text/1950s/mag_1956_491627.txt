By JAMES CAGNEY , as told to Pete Martin Born on New York 's East Side  --  the son of an Irish bartender Jimmy Cagney slugged and snarled his way to Hollywood 's highest honors . Here , in his own words , is the private life of a make-believe public enemy . PART ONE My philosophy has always been to do anything that comes my way seeking to 1w done . This willingness astonishes producers . When they ask tentatively , " How about doing so-and-so ? " and / say , " Why nut ? " they look at me funny . " What do you prefer to do ? " they ask . " I do n't prefer to do anything . " I tell them . " If a good musical comes along , I 'll do a musical . If a good comedy conies along , I 'll do comedy . If a good heavy drama comes my way , I 'll do heavy drama . Back where I came from , if there was a buck to he made , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " To me , the juice of this philosophy lies in the story of an English Shakespearean troupe which had played the provinces for years . At last the troupe 's " juvenile " died of old age and the manager sent to London for a replacement . A new hill was opening un a Monday night and the curtain was to go up at eight-thirty . At eight-twenty-five a tall , cadaverous character walked in wearing a top hat , a long overcoat with a fur collar , spats , cane , bushy eyebrows and Wary black hair . He went down to the cellar where the company was dressing , rubbed one hand on a whitewashed wall , and used the calcimine for make-tip . He wet his fingers , reached under his boot , took some dirt from it and darkened his eyebrows . Then he turned to the manager and asked , " Where is your stage and what arc we playing ibis evening ? " The way I sec it , that tall , cadaverous party was a pro . Finding myself in print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never ducked a part just because I 've never tried it before , and I 'm not going to start now . Anyhow , telling my story instead of writing it ought to make it easier . However , there is one thing I 'm going to have to watch ; I talk too fast , so maybe I 'd better try to follow the advice of the writer , John Steinbeck . Steinbeck once said something to a movie producer that I know . Words jumbled out of this producer so fast that he gave everybody ahard time understanding him . One night he was whizzing along so fast that his sentences went by in a kind of blur , and he did n't pause for ten minutes . ' When he did , Steinbeck looked at him and said , " O.K. ; now break it down into words . " People who know about such things also tell me that I 've got to pick out an " angle " to hang my story on . A lot of them take it for granted that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " II they think that , they 're wrong . What comeback ? I have n't been away . I 've averaged a picture a year for years . I 've been doing as much work as I wanted to do . When you 've been around as long as I have , it 's wise to give some thought to wearing out your welcome . Then , in 1954 , I made four pictures ; they were all released within a short period in 1955 , and they all happened to be exceptional pictures , so what happened to me was more of a coincidence than a comeback . Those four were a western , Run for Cover ; Mister Roberts ; Love Me or Leave Mc , and The Seven Little Foys As a result , the rumor is out that rin as hot as a Dixieland cornet . These things just happen . You ca n't explain or control them . Show business is as unpredictable as a bicycle in heavy traffic . A young kid comes along ; he does a few radio shows , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a small part in a stage show . Suddenly he 's given a part with which he can do something , and away he goes . The word is , " He 's a discovery . " And he 's asked , " Where have you been ? " His answer is : " I 've been here in your casting office all the time , right under your nose , trying to make a lousy buck . Where have rim been ? " Spence Tracy was no better or worse an actor in Bad Day at Black Rock in 1955 than he was in Captains Courageous in 1997 , yet he won an Academy Award for that earlier picture . It 's what an actor is given to work with that makes all the difference . He 's like a football coach But you never know when you 're going to get good material . While I was working in Run for Cover , in 1954 . Paramount asked me out of a blue sky , " Would you like to play the George M. Cohan bit for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture Bob Hope 's making ? " I had n't read that sequence , but I said " Sure . " I knew that any Cohan part , even a short one , would be interesting . Paramount and 1 never discussed money . I did n't even think about it . I did it out of friendship for Paramount and for Hope . Besides . 1 knew I 'd get something valuable our of it . I wanted to take off some extra lard I 'd picked up , and the easiest way for me to do that is to hoof sew:rid hours a day . I was n't kidding myself . I took off fil-teen pounds . When all the shooting was over , both Hope and Paramount gave me a new double horse trailer , lined with red leather , so I could move my horses back and forth . It was so de luxe I could have lived in it myself . In addition , they gave me a scroll " Thanks for the trailer you did for us , " it read . " Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mostly hoofing , it required rehearsing for three endless , aching weeks . Not many people know how much blood and sweat a dancer 's job takes out of him or her . I 've seen them come into a theater for a rehearsal , and before they 're done every tendon and sinew in their bodies is screaming . And the next A.M. the screaming is louder ! When I 'm taking otT lard for a hoofing picture and the piano is humping , I usually wear a sweat shirt . Over that sweat shirt I pull on a kind of rubberized silk thing , and over my head 1 wear a contrivance of my own . It 's made of a beret teamed up with the sleeves of a sweat shirt wrapped around my net k , then tied behind I can work up quite a drip dressed like that , and when I sit down the sweat  --  and the blubber  --  pours from me . I 'm not beefing about the ordeal that a dancer undergoes in getting ready . I simply state it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city editor of the Los Angeles Examiner , has a saying : " Work consists of work . " It seems ICI me that Jun lima his finger squarely on it . If you want to survive , there 's labor to be done . People who do n't chink that " work consists of work " wind up looking fur handouts . The only way to survive in any business  --  particularly in show business  --  is never to cheat by hunting otu a short cut or an easier way . Onto I was doing a picture with a young Mall who had to go into a bout with a stunt man . " I 've an idea For you which I think will be very colorful , " I said . " Kind of a judo trick . When that stunt man comes at you , you do so-and-so ; and you can throw him . " " My double is going 10 du that , " hr said . " Why do n't you do it yourself ? " I asked . " You 're young . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the Camera off you . They 'll keep it right on you and the audience will see you do it . " " Not me , " he said . " That 's my double 's job. ? I regarded this young roan and f thought , Miskr , sou are an your way our I was right . He never amounted to anything . He thought too much of his precious skin to risk it . I try to learn to do the things needed in a film myself . I 11 Blood on the Sun , I played a newspaperman in japan . There was to be a judo scene in the picture , and I got hold Of a judo expert and worked with him . I did n't know it then , but there are grades of judo . My first teacher , Jack Halloran , was ct third-degree black-belt judoist ; he 's now fourth degree . My last teacher was a fifth-degree black-belt named Kenneth Kuniyuki . Both are really great teachers . I grew so fond of judo I used to keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else put me UT1 ter side lines . Sc . it could be that the phrase " Work consists of work " is the peg I 'm looking for to hang my slurry on . We Cagney children were brought up on work We were for Do it Yourself before Do it Yourself was invented . My brother . Bill , says that when he 's got something to figure out , he gathers all of his shoes and polishes them , and it helps . I know what he means . I 'm never really happy unless I 'm working at something . My wife . Willie , will tell you , " ' When Jim has a pitiblem , he tills the soil or shovels manure . " She 's right  --  to this extent : I 'm always doing something like that , but it is n't always because rim working on a problem . It 's a habit . I 've done it su long I would n't be happy if I did n't , Ti ; me , hard manual labor is a preventive for neuroses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mow plates where they send people who 've had nervous breakdowns . They give Owm something to do with their hands . Harold Ross , who , prior to his death , WAS the editor of the New ) ( raker , once had a severe nervous crack-up . Shortly after lie got out of the hospital , I went to see him . I admired a table I Saw . It was a fine , strong table . 1 could we that it was homemade . " That , " I said , " is a real nice table . " " You like it ? " he asked . " It 's great , " I said . " Made it when I was crazy , " he said . I first learned the value of hard work from my inslter , Carolyn Nelson Cagney , a woman with a strong round and a great purpose . From the time %se four Gagney sons knew what the words meant , mom was saying , " Get an education  --  get an education . " Her determination rubbed olE first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve , he 'd made up his mind to be a doctor , and he stuck with it until he became one . Morn stuck with it too . She made sacrifices to help him along . Mom was always sick . We kids spent a lot of time at hospitals visiting her in free wards , and I think Harry got it into his head that if he became a doctor he could help her . Most of her sickness had to do with her gall bladder . They took 177 stone ; from her in one operation . Finally they took her gall bladder away altogether . It had been infected for years . Mom was led-haired , half Norwegian , half Irish . Her eyes were slants , . She was only five feet one , but by the time she was thirty she had grown very heavy , She got up to 175 pounds ; then i so ; finally to The extra weight shot her blood pressure up , and in the end it killed her . But in spite of mom 's bad health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house . We laughed about anything . Nhan would sing a song , and if it was a beautiful song she 'd cry over it There 's a saying , " The Irish can even cry at card tricks , " and some songs affect me that way too . But we 'd watch her nose gel red and we 'd begin to laugh ; then we four sons would go over to her and mg her and sing a livelier song . That dried her tears and took her out of her mood . I was born in New York City  --  on the lower East Side , around Nth Street and Avenue D. When I was a year old , my family moved to Yorkville . So the first neighborhood that I really recall is East 79th Street . When I WWI a Bole tot I climbed up into the space under mom 's sewing machine  --  the place where the treadle was  --  and hid there from anything and anybody who might bother me . Once a friend of mom 's came to call and drink a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her small daughter along . After a while they missed me and the daughter , and they found us snuggled together under that old sewing machine . Awriter friend of mine , Harlan Ware , swears that it 's the memory of the hour% that 1 spent safe in that space under that sewing machine that makes me feel really comfortable only in small , compact houses . My wife , Willie , claims that for the mine reason I like I to ims that are out too sprawly in a house , that I feel I can wrap around me . Maybe Willie and Harlan have mane-thing there , for both my home in Chilmark , on the island of Martha 's Vineyard . and my house in Millbrrxuk , New York , arc small enough to fit into the average living room on a movie set , And when I visit New York I head straight for the Players Club and check into a thumbnail-size bedroom there under the eaves , instead of going for a suite in a flossy hotel . Fur NOW reason I feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as an overgrown sleeping bag . Harlan Vi'are calls it my " sewing-machine room . " AVIien my ' mother was raised on New York 's East Side , street fighting was an everyday occurs erne , and it was : Still an ? veryday tA:CGirellt  --  when her suns grew up . We Gagneys were often in brawls  --  more often than nut , in fart . You did n't have to know another kid to light him after school . Siane T // body said , " I know a guy whir ran la I. : you . " Land you said , " Is that so ? " and after school you net that guy and battled hirn . Either you licked him or he licked y You knew you 'd won when the Other guy quit . Such a fight might hot two or three days . You 'd go 10 it for half an hour , then call it a day and reline back the next day to Finish U. %I-upping it up might even need a third day . Not bag ago I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v it and I showed her the apartnient house where the Cagney family once lived . Then , just for the heck of it , we walked into the vestibule and looked at the narnrs on the mailhows set into die wall , to see if anyone I had known in the old days was still on hand . I could barely believe it , but one old lady was still on deck who had lived in that house while we were Mere . We went up to see her , but she was vague in her mind about me until something clicked , and Shr said , " Oh , yes . You 're the one who was always fighting . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said . " I guess I 'm the one . " The environment where I lived produced fighters . Irish Patsy Klein and Eddie Fitzsimmons and Jimmy Blut  --  just a club fightes , but a good one  --  came from my Street or the streets nearby . As I saw it at that age , being a fighter was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sixteen or seventeen , I decided I 'd pick up some ready change that way . People who Imes told me that I was a goad boxer , and I began to get ready . Just when I was all set to get a fight , mom found out what was going on . What with staying up at night working as a waiter in a restaurant , going to high school and getting up early in the morning to do road work to strengthen my legs , began to look run-down . Mom asked , " What are you doing to yourself ? " I told her that a friend of mine was going to put me on in the prelims at the new Polo A.A. or Fairmont A.C. , and that I was going to pick up ten bucks for a four-round bout . " DO you think you can lick me ? " morn asked . " Why ? " I asked . " Because you 'll have to lick me first , " she said . That was the end of my quick-money ring career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . called Winner Take All , and 1 did my own boxing in it . A pal of mine , Pete ) . Leyden , with whom I 'd boxed many a time back un : 9th Street . wrote to me , " You 've still got a useful kit hand . " That meant more to me than any of the words the critics bestowed upon toe . When I was young , I had a pal named Artie Klein whose dad would give him a great big penny every Sunday as his weekly allowance . but allowances were n't usual in our neighborhood . If some of the kids wanted movie money , they 'd go down the cellars under the apartment houses , sued the doorbell batteries , knock the carbon out and sell the zinc to a junk dealer . Ours was the kind of neighborhood where kids about twelve or fourteen thought loathing of loosening a few bricks of a chimney on a roof , and if a cop they did n't like happened to be passing by , they 'd toss one his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their sisters were ladies to us . We would n't say hell or damn in front of them A kid can tell the difference between a lady and a nordads very early in life . Many languages were spoken on New York 's East Side , and a smattering of them stuck to me . One 44 " our neighlana oat. a young Italian ss ornao who could n't read or write . She brought Hie the ' letters she gut from Naples and : eked me to read them to her . I did n't know any Italian except Ow dirty words I 'd learned around the neighborhood , but I read Mose letters to her anyhow in my New York-Irish mangling of Italian pronunciation . and she sat there and tried to squeeze sonic meaning out of what I said . I also speak pretty fair Yiddish. in our neighborhood we had quite a few Jewish people , and I learned Yiddish at Stuyvesant High . Not that they taught it there ; they naught German , and I was a pretty good German student , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I studied German , I learned the Yiddish equivalent of the Gennan words . My Jewish pals tell me that I talk Yiddish with a iGau.sh accent , but some years ago 1 spoke it well enough to help a friend of mine , Bob Sill , who was the New York correspondent for the Boston Globe . The Globe ' wired Sill that a Jewish show which was playing New York was coming to BOSl  --  ll , and they wanted him to review it before it reached Boston , so they 'd have his review ready to print . Sill was Jewish , but he did n't know any Yiddish , so he took inc with him to translate the dialogue . I roust have done all right , for his editor said it was a good review . There 's a Hollywood story about me that goes like this : " Cagney once faced two studio bosses wills a demand for a salary kick . After they 'd batted it around for a while , the two big shots launched Mu , Yiddish , thinking that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I listened in on their conversation long enough to understand what they were hatching up for me ; then started to speak Yiddish too . The way it really happened was n't like that . One of Muse two basses knew that I understood Yiddish , and when his pal started to use that language , the first one said in Yiddish , " Take it easy ; the Gentile understands. - That was all there was to it . I hate to step on an anecdote that 's been told so many times , but I want it told straight here . We Cagneys did a lot of roughhousing in our railroad fiat , but mom had her own way of quieting us . I 've already said that she weighed a lot ; so much that she could n't chase us . But if she could grab one of us , she 'd put the one she nabbed against the wall and lean on him and let him have it , When morn leaned on you , you could n't Move . We children learned a lesson from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have to put everything you 've gum into it . She was right . To prove it . I offer Bing Crosby as in caw in point . Bing is widely known as the most casual entertainer in show business . The adjective " easygoing " is reserved for him . In 19-1-2 Bing and I were traveling with the Hollywood Victory Caravan for Army-Navy Relief , for which a fair country group of talent had been gathered together acv a touring troupe . There were Bob Hope , Cary Grant , Charlie Buyer , Olivia Dc Hay-Wand , Groucho Marx , Jerry Colonna , Frances Langford . Joan Blondell , Joan Bennett , Pat O'Brien , Frank McHugh , Bert Lahr , Arleen Whelan and many others . Bing joined us in Chicago , and we played the Chicago Stadium , before:AOC ? people . Bob Hope introduced Bing , and when lie came out On the stage he looked very small in all that vastness , He had on a blue coat with brass buttons , rust-colored trousers , brown-and-white shoes and a green necktie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out and he was given such a tremendous ovation that when it died down the stillness was oppressive . You could feel those eo , 000 people waiting . Then the magic in Bing moose out  --  and " magic " is the word  --  and he said to that audience , " What du you want to hear ? " aVhen he asked them that , the noise almost bent the walla s of the stadium outward , The crowd quieted again , and he asked , " Do you want to leave it to me ? " and the noise beat down on him again . He said to the orchestra leader , " Hit me , Al . " Al Newman waved his baton and the band struck up the first two bars of My Mammy Done Told Me . Once more pandemonium broke loose . When the yelling and clapping and whistling stopped , he began to sing . W'hen he was through , there was little left for anyone else to do . I was standing in the wings when Bing came off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual and so easygoing , the veins in his forehead were standing out an eighth of an inch . That 's how casual lie was , This is not debunking on my part . Nobody gets mom of is sock out of Bing than I do . But to me , that 's the way the great ones do it . They tear it nut of their insides  --  and they make it look easy while they 're doing is Of course , Bing was working . " Work consists of work . " When you 're on , you 're on . As Bing came off , my music started . I turned to Pat O'Brien , who was standing behind me , and I said , " Following Bing is like being in hell with your back broken . " I had six girls behind me with American flags . They wore the briefest of red-whiteand-blue costumes , and they were beauties and they had everything Hying . I needed every bit of it to follow Bing , including the flags . My pop did n't have the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was James Francis Cagney . He was all Irish . In his early days he 'd been a bookkeeper , than he 'd got a job in a saloon , tending bar . After that , for a year he had his own place between sloth and tost on First Avenue . He had a series of things he did every morning before leaving to go to work . He 'd kiss mom good-by ; then he 'd blow a kiss to us kids , put on his hat over his shock of heavy black hair , bless himself , run Ins hands over his Ionisers to make sure that all his buttons were buttoned , and be off . Al far as I know , he did that every morning of his married life , Pop was no businessman , and at the end of a year of owning his own place he was again working for somebody else . He liked the race tracks and a but of his money went down that drain . In addition , he had a weakness for drink . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booze . But he was kind ; he had a host of friends and he was good-natured  --  too good-natured . As soon as he got his mitts on anything , he spent it . If anybody bought him a drink , he 'd buy two back . He was called the Two-for-One Bartender , and there 's no future in that . Because my father ran a saloon , my whole family had a fix against booze . Booze was the heavy in our house  --  the evil that lived with us . To this day , my brothers Harry and Eddie , and my sister , Jeanne , have never taken a drink , and I disliked saloons so much that I was never in a night club until I was twenty-nine . In 1947 I did the first national broadcast ever put on by Alcoholics Anonymous . Near the end of his life , alcohol made pap so sick they 'd wheel an ambulance up to the door and take him away to a hospital . It was rough to see that , if you loved bins as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kids took Over as bread earners , From the time I was fourteen . living money at the Cagneys ' was sketchy . But there was mom looking at us with blazing eyes and telling us , " Stay in schoall Do n't give up school ! Do n't you dare give up school ! " So we found jobs after school , worked like dogs , brought home enough money to get through . Wintertimes I worked at night at anything I could find . When summer came , I 'd get a full-time daytime job . It was nothing fur me to be holding down three jobs at once  --  one in the daytime , one at night and one Sundays . At fourteen I was an office boy for the New York Sun . At seventeen I was a bellhop at the Friars Club , and there were many other jobs in between . One Sunday job was selling excursion tickets on a Hudson River boat line . One summer I worked full time at Wan-=Ace 's , wrapping bundles in the basement . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six ; then I rushed home , washed up , had dinner and ducked into the subway over to I tatit Street and Amsterdam Avenues to wait table at a restaurant there from eight until twelve , It was while 1 was at Stuyvesant High and my brother , Eddie , was in Townsend Harris High and my brothel , Harry , was at Columbia University that we four Cagney brushers all worked in that eating place at 114th Street at the same time . Bill , the youngest , was supposed to be too young to be working , but Ile was big enough to wear long pants and he got away with it . We Cagneys looked so much alike that the customers rarely knew which one of us was taking care of their table . They 'd look at one of us and ask , " You my waiter ? " Our honest answer usually was , " No ; my Le to her . " Certainly we would n't deliberately neglect those who ate there . Our need for Lips from those people was too great to'negiect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between surviving and not surviving . The usual way to handle a plate with change on it was to put it in front of a customer , say , " Thank you very much , " then walk away . By the time you came back , generosity was supposed to have set in . But none of us Cagneys ever walked assay ; we stood there and glared at the C11510Inell and tried to influence than mentally . Most of the time our silent glar-ing paid id off to the tune of an extra nickel or dime . Later I took a job working nights SJ a corn bination ( Cm ! lllll 4-41 frwn l ' .. 5r hot doorman and 114.11.1111 rt .11 the Lenox East Side StadeMCIII UMW ' 4111 East faith Street .

The most important-sounding job I had was custodian of books in the New York Public Library . For that I got twelve and a half cents an hour from the city Of New York , or around t$17.50 a month . When people look books off the slicks-es and put them on the tables to read , it was my job ro sec that they got back on the shelves in alphabetical and numerical order . The worst day of all was Saturday . There was no school then and the kids came in and they scrambled the books just for the hell of it .

There were bucks that needed to be earned at night , and we four Cagneys were working again at the restaurant-tea room , Back in my Columbia days I talked to fast that half the time nobody could understand what I said . A nd as I say . some people still think that 1 talk fast . Every time I make a picture I get letters from fans in Great Britain who beg me , " Ca n't you slow your Speer h a bit , because , what with your American accent , we have a difficult time getting what you 're talking about .

" Yes , " I said , and I Silt down . For some reason I Bunked that course . But I did n't flunk German , which was taught by Professor Nlankiewicz , the father of the Academy-Award-winning movie director , Joseph Marikiewic2 . I spoke good German , but I went so fast that the other kids never knew what I was saying . The only one who knew was Professor Marlkiewicz , and he died laughing .

At one point I bought her a place in Maivarliuseus . Morn was really a big-city girl at heart  --  her roots were set in concrete pavements  --  but 1 thought that anybody who had a chance would love the country . I spotted a place on the sea a man had built for his wife , When it wasfintshed , he 'd shown it to her ; she 'd taken one look at it , had said , " 1 would n't live in it live minutes , " and had walked away . The husband had locked the dour and had never come back . I thought this house would be ideal for my brothers and their kids and for mom . The idea was for mom to have her family around her . But she was only there for about two weeks when she said , " Jim , you love it here , but my idea of fun is sitting in a window on the corner of 1-and Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not for me , " Then , in 1919 , she packed up and went to California . There was a nice house for rent on Palm Drive , in Beverly Hills , but she wanted to he in a ( low:mown apartment where she could go to the avenue and shop at the grocery and drop in at the live-and-dimes and ix . handy to the movies . She thought that was living , su that 's tile kind of deal we gave At the end , a thing happened I wish had enough eloquence to describe . Mom had had a stroke and was dying . After that she suffered little creeping multiple strokes . Harry , Eddie , Bill and I were in Los Angeles . We sent for sister Jeanne and she flew out . When she got there , there was no speech left in mom ; only the ability to make moaning sounds and to move the fingers of one hand . When Jeanne came in , morn signaled us till close in her . When we were gathered , she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and indicated her second finger . She looked at Eddie and indicated her ring finger . Then she looked at Bill and indicated her pinkie . Last of all she looked atkanne , folded her thumb into the pogo of her hand and pulled all the four fingers over it . She was telling us , " Take care of Jeanne . " Jeanne was twenty-six when mom died , and already she had proved that she could take care of herself better than most girls . In Ma she 'd worked at the Pasadena Playhouse in Brother Rat . In t999 she 'd appeared in a radio version of CeilingZero for Cecil B. De Mille , and on the Kraft Music Hall program . in I910 she had worked in four movies for RICO and Paramount : All Women Have Secrets , Queen of the Mob , Golden Gloves and Rhythm on the River . In I9-S2 site had a role in Yankee Doodle Dandy for Warner Brothers . So she was not exactly helpless . But to mom , Jeanne was still her baby . And it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rallying around if Jeanne ever needed us.
