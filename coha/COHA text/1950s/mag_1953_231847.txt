An Amish farm is likely to have a horse-drawn buggy in the yard and no electric lights in the house . The men of the sect ( an offshoot of the Mennonites ) wear wide-brimmed black hats , plain black suits , and beards ; the women , plain bonnets and voluminous clothes . For some 35,000 thrifty , hard-working Amish folk , living mostly in Ohio , Indiana and Pennsylvania , the Devil is a sleepless foe , whom they dodge by foregoing automobiles , plumbing , cosmetics , store-bought underwear , high-school education and all manner of frivolity . Amish folk seldom break through the black homespun that seems to divide them from their neighbors , but when they do , outsiders get a glimpse of the strange life behind the curtain . Last week Hazleton , Iowa ( pop . 550 ) was still agitated by such an escape : two Amish girls had gone out into the Devil 's world . <P> One night last December , Emma Miller , 18 , stole out of her parents ' house , wearing a sinful pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into town and eventually found a job as a houseworker . One Sunday afternoon last month , her friend Anna Yoder , 18 , turned up at Emma 's apartment in an Amish bonnet and with a yen to cut loose , too . " I cut her hair and washed . . . and set it , " said Emma . " I put makeup on her and dressed her in my clothes . " <P> But that evening Anna 's father and six other Amish men were outside in a car they had borrowed for the emergency . They talked earnestly with errant Anna on the front porch . " All of a sudden they got around Anna and carried her off , " said Emma . " You could see from Anna 's face looking back that she was scared to death . But they did n't hurt her . They all went away in the car . " <P> Pink-cheeked , brown-eyed Emma had also received visits from her parents , but they did not coerce her to return . " My mother told me that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " said Emma . " She told me my soul is in hell . It is not . I have read the Bible . I know that it is n't just the Hooks* that go to heaven , like they told us . All kinds can get there if you live right . " <P> Emma Miller is now thoroughly in the world : she goes to the Presbyterian Church and is planning to work in a beauty parlor . <P> <P> *Slang for the Amish , derived from the hooks and eyes they wear on their coats and vests instead of buttons .
