The most famous " oldest American " is Folsom man , known by his peculiar , fluted spearheads . These " points " have turned up in many parts of the U.S. , and since they have been found with the bones of extinct animals , they are supposed to be about 10,000 years old . But Folsom man himself is an anthropological ghost ; his own bones have not been found . <P> About a year ago , Keith Glasscock , a pipeline welder and amateur archaeologist , spent a Sunday afternoon poking around the Scharbauer Ranch near Midland , Texas . In a " blowout " ( a hollow scooped by wind ) , he found some Folsom points . When he returned a few days later , the wind had dug the hollow deeper . On the surface of the blowing sand were fragments that looked like broken human bones . Glasscock picked them up , but was wise enough not to dig without expert advice . <P> Extinct Animals . On vacation a few days later , he went to Santa Fe and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bones and points . Dr. Wendorf was so enthusiastic that Glasscock gave him the whole collection . Soon Wendorf and a group of learned colleagues were digging a trench at the Midland site . They found a few more bone fragments , and six months later , in a full-dress expedition , found a selection of ice-age animals , most of which were probably extinct before the period of Folsom man . It looked as if both human and animal bones had come from a stratum of grey sand that lay considerably below the reddish sand containing the Folsom points . <P> The diggers made no announcement . Like most anthropologists , they had been intimidated by the recent British proof that the remains of Piltdown man , reputedly 950,000 years old , were a deliberate fake . They did not want to say anything until the bones , which had been sent to Anthropologist T. Dale Stewart of the U.S. National Museum at Washington , had been scientifically authenticated . <P> Fluorine Proof . Last week they got the news . Dr. Stewart had fitted about 60 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that it is extremely old for a relic of New World man . Dr. F. J. McClure of the National Institute of Health analyzed both animal and human bones for their fluorine content , which increases with age . He decided that their age is about the same . Since the animals lived in the Pleistocene ( glacial ) era , " Midland man " must be Pleistocene too . He may have lived anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 years before Folsom man , who therefore remains a ghost , but is no longer the oldest American . <P> Midland man , according to Dr. Stewart , had a long , narrow skull and probably looked like a modern Indian . The bones found were probably those of a male who had serious trouble with his teeth . At the time of his death , when the glaciers still covered much of the U.S. , one of his teeth was growing up toward his nose . <P> While the Midland diggers were proceeding with commendable caution , the relics found at Piltdown ( and accepted for years without sufficient tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ish scientists . Not only the human remains but the animal ones , too , were proved to be fakes . The flint implements found with " Piltdown man " had been stained , and the bone implement had been shaped with a steel knife . The perpetrator of the erudite hoax is still unknown .
