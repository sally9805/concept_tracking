txt Consumers , whether they be Mr. and Mrs. John Q. , the federal government which is the biggest consumer of all-time , or a subdivision of government , ' are calling the economy 's tune in last foxtrot time . This trio has been supreme in the United States since 1946 . There is no evidence anywhere in any serious report about , the'reconomy that the consumers intend to change the tune to a slow waltz . These three great spenders are on the biggest spree in history . They like it , They propose to continue it . The United States is thus so committed to extensive public and private , that any great shift in national prosprity in the near future seems precluded , regardless of the outcome of the national elections Nov. 6 . ( Federal Reserve Holds Back But this points up a sober fact : namely , that the Federal Reserve ' System  --  and the Federal Reserve System alone ? is the only agency seriously trying to do anything to slow down inflation . No one else seems to care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government . This biggest of all the consumers said , " I 'm going to spend more than ever before.in the history of any peacetime United States Govvernment . The Federal Reserve may worry about inflation , but I 'm going to put more money into the spending stream than has ever been put into the spending stream except during war . And what can the Federal Reserve do about it ? " Both Democrats and Republicans joined in this cue . The business and economic newsletter of the First National City Bank of New York  --  one of the most careful economic commentaries availTrend of the Economy able  --  notes that " no other Congress ? in peacetime or cold war  --  ever appropriated as much money as did the 84th Congress in the session just ended , and none in the past 10 years granted in total so much of what the President requested . " Students of government and economics , both within official circles and without , are concerned that the federal government itself took this biggest step in peacetime history at the very time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned that efforts to control federal expenditures apparently came unhinged this year ; " and that long-range spending " programs have been started without an examination for their inflationary iinnaet Arms Spending Adds Pressure Earlier this month , Secretary of the Treasury George M. Humphrey spoke about the problem befcre , thc Economic CM ) . of Detroit . He noted that " consumers do n't buy tanks or bombers , " and commented that by spending " in the neighborhood of 40 billion dollars for military goods and services , " the federal government " in its own fiscal policy is putting a great pressure on the market for goods by putting that much money into this spending stream and not putting added goods out for the people to buy . " This defense spending now accounts for 59 per cent of the money the federal government collects in taxes . The First National City Bank notes that nondefense expenditures increased 9 per cent to a record high of 28.3 billion dollars , and that state and local governments are expected to take 30 billion dollars in revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal income of nearly 339 billion dollars is 29 per cent . " The striking fact in the United States today , " comments the bank , " is the shortage of capital in relation to demands . To grow , , the country needs larger savings flow . " " ? . : ' Pent.Up Demand in Nation But taxes drain off savings . If savings could be stepped up , the Federal Reserve would not need to carry the full burden of inflation restraint , as it is now doing . The past 10 years have not been especially conducive to saving . A great pent-up demand for goods and services , houses and business properties existed after . World War II . Even so , the people of the United States made a good savings record . In 1948 they saved 5.3 per cent of their disposable income . In 1952 , the last year of the Democratic administration ; they saved 8 per cent of their disposable income . In 1954 they saved 7 per cent ; In 1955 they dropped to 6.1 per cent . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second quarter savings rose by 2.2 billion dollars . 1956 may hit 7 per cent . But consumer credit has also risen . It is 14 per cent ahead of a year ago . Personal income is up ' five per cent over a year ago . Higher interest rates  --  especially if translated into the rates paid on savings accounts  --  may induce more savings . Insurance is a means of saving . Paying off mortgages is another savings procedure . Pension accumulation is another . This is a key point to inflation control : The rate of saving . Will the American consumer join in the effort ? Business forecasts indicate spending is on the rise . A Dun &; Bradstreet " Survey of Business Men 's ExpectatiOns " forecast a higher trend for 1957 in net sales , net profits , higher selling prices , and higher employment . Every major source , but one , forecasts a biggerthan-ever year ahead for business . Too Much All at Once ' The rate of business spending for capital need : are at an all-time high . A rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry over well into and probably through 1957 . The government has set the pace and no evidence of restraint on spending has yet appeared The one major source expressing Some doubt about the 1957 car year , for instance , is Arthur ' Wiesenberger &; Company , 61 Broadway , New York . The firm 's latest letter speaking of ' bright hopes for a good car year , " comments as follows " Whether , these hopes can be fulfilled in the face of the most restrictive credit conditions in many years and the possibility that growing automobile competition may force some absorption of increased ? raW Material prices remains to be seen . Investors convinced of the prospects for a good car year may have their confidence shaken before long . " All other reports are expansive . Secretary Humphrey rather aptly described the problem of the United States today as " the problem of too much all at once . " The tune is a fast one and there are hardly any wallflowers .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
