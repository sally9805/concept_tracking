" We used to have three institutions at the Academy , " said a Navy commander . " Billy goat , Tecumseh and ' Spike ' Webb . Now we have only two . " Unfortunately , the Navy can do little about its loss . Tecumseh 's bronze hide is still proof against the weather and the pranks of midshipmen . Replacing a billy goat is not too difficult , even at Annapolis . But time is beginning to catch up with Spike , the bald and bandy-legged little boxing coach who taught generations of officers and gentlemen to box . He has turned 65 , and the rules of the Naval Academy have forced him to retire . <P> <P> No one who knew him thought that Spike was ready to retire from boxing . Last week some of his old friends were enthusiastically arguing that Spike is a highly trained technical expert and ought to be shipped to Israel as Point Four aid . Spike and Israel heartily agree . Young Israeli gentlemen , they say , would do well to learn their fighting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master , learned his boxing the hard way-on the streets of turn-of-the-century Baltimore . An only boy surrounded by five sisters , young Hamilton Murrell Webb did all the fighting for the family . He grew up with a bloody nose . By the time he was 14 , he was tough enough to fight and win a four-round bout at the old Erica Athletic Club . He earned eight shiny half dollars , and from that night on he was a professional . <P> <P> By 1916 cocky young Spike Webb was a comer , good enough to tangle in a nontitle Donnybrook with Johnny Kilbane , the featherweight champion . But before he had a chance to tackle Kilbane again , Spike was mixed up in a much bigger brawl . As coach of the 29th Division boxing team , he caught the eye of General John J. Pershing . At war 's end he trained the A.E.F. boxing team for the Inter-Allied Army games in Paris . Spike has no trouble recalling the most stylish fighter on his squad : a young marine light heavyweight named Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hired by the Naval Academy to run its puny and unpopular boxing program . The Academy was never the same again . Spike organized a boxing team that was undefeated for eleven years . He did not rest until boxing was made an important part of the regular physical training program and one of the biggest crowd attractions at Annapolis . Once , to cut the cheering section to manageable size , the Academy made formal dress the uniform for attending fights . MacDonough Hall gymnasium was still filled to capacity . <P> Quaint Habit . Spike made Navy boxing his life . He taught all his midshipmen the same jabbing , skipaway style that saved Gene Tunney after Jack Dempsey flattened him for the famed long count in 1927 . And he was a bug on conditioning . All Webb teams did road work before reveille ; all Webb boxers developed washboard bellies . They needed them . Coach Webb had a quaint habit of slamming his fist into any abdomen within range , by way of greeting .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
