A Story by DON MOSER Drawings by Julian Levi it ; * " ? ? . - -c . " ; ; G , ? eckati - , EVENING FLIGHT I T WAS almost time for the evening flight , and Jeff walked along the Lake Erie beach near the water 's edge where the sand was hard , and the late sun threw a long shadow in front of him . A boy of eleven , he walked slowly , hands in his blue jeans ' pockets , his new tennis shoes leaving waffle-prints in the wet sand behind him . After a while he looked up and stopped . He saw Black Jack shuffle ota of the sand dunes farther up the beach . Black Jack dropped his burlap sack of empty pop bottles on the sand and peered around . He saw Jeff and put his hand over his eyes to shade them from the low sun . The boy and the old beachcomber stood on the sand looking at each other . Jeff took his hands from his pockets and rubbed them on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with him he would not be afraid , but there was no one at all on the beach , nothing but the gulls curling over the water . Jeff did n't believe the stories he had heard about Black Jack putting children in the burlap sack and carrying them off to his shack down in the marsh . Jeff did n't believe that story or the others Ken 's father had told him , but he was still afraid of the old man . Black Jack kept peering at him from under his hand . Jeff thought : " I wo n't leave . I want to go to the bridge and see the birds . I 'll just stand here and flip stones and maybe he won'trecognize me . If he comes down the beach I can run and I can beat him back to the park , and if he goes up the beach I can wait a while and go on to the bridge . " Jeff picked up a small flat stone from the sand , and flipped it out on the water , using only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and sailed and bounced again and again . The low sun turned the waves bright and silvery and Jeff could n't see the stone fly in the glare until it hit and made a splash of spray . He pretended to look for another stone then , watching the beachcomber out of the corner of his eye . He saw Black Jack pick up his sack of bottles again and sling it over his shoulder and go shuffling up the beach . " He did n't recognize me , " Jeff thought . " That 's good . I can still go to the bridge now and see the Hight . " Jeff stayed by the water 's edge until Black Jack had gone farther up the beach , then followed slowly so that he would n't catch up . Black Jack moved along taking his time , looking on the sand for empty soda-pop bottles and things bathers had left during the day . Jeff saw him lean over to pick something from the sand and put it in the burlap sack . " I wish he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if I do n't get to the bridge soon . " After a while the old man passed the point where the path to the bridge came out of the dunes onto the beach , and when the boy reached it he ran in among the dunes , not afraid now that Black Jack could n't see him . He ran along the faint sandy path , dodging twisted driftwood logs until he reached the grass meadow that skirted the marsh . He followed the meadow to the line of willow trees and went down among them , stooping low under the heavy-hanging branches . He parted the branches and came out onto the old wooden footbridge that crossed a neck of the marsh . Jeff walked onto the bridge and climbed up on the wide handrail and sat on it , swinging his legs over the dark water . " I 'm in time , " he thought . " They have n't started yet . " He looked out across the low dunes to the lake lying like hammered silver in the sun . " The flight wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he thought . He pushed his brown hair back from his eyes and watched the swallows spinning over the marsh , and thought about how he had first found the bridge and watched the evening flight . T W 0 weeks before , Jeff had moved from the city to the little shore village on the lake . A few evenings ago his new friends , Ken and Jimmy , asked him to go to the beach with them . Jeff 's mother did n't want him to go because of the things she had heard about the old man who lived in the marsh and prowled the beach in the evening . " He 's filthy , " she said . " I saw him down at Morrow 's grocery  --  he 'd brought in a sack of bottles to get the deposit refunds . He 's the filthiest thing I 've even seen and I do n't want you to go near that man . " But Jeff 's father said that he could go if he was careful . So he and Ken and Jimmy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased him . After they ran away from him they walked along the water 's edge looking for stones and shells . Moving ahead , Ken picked up something from the sand , then called for them to come look at it . He held a small piece of driftwood , smoothed and shaped by the waves so that it looked like a knife  --  like a pirate 's dagger . Jeff wanted the dagger , but Ken said that he was going to sand it and paint it silver like a real dagger . And when they walked back down the beach Ken wore it stuck in his belt , - draping his hand carelessly over the hilt . The next night Jeff went back to the beach to see if he could find another . Ken and Jimmy had gone to the movies , so he went alone . He walked up the beach for a long way , much farther than they had gone the night before , andhe watched the sand closely for a piece of driftwood shaped like a dagger , but he found nothing . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dunes , and wondering where it led , he followed it to the bridge . He had sat on the rail , just as now , and then the flight began , with all the world yellow in the sunset and the small dark birds flying in thousands up the marsh . He watched it until dusk and he had never seen anything like it before . It was better than African movies , better than circuses , better than anything . S OMETHING dimpled the water of the marsh and a ring swelled out across the dark smooth surface and rippled against cattail stems . Jeff wondered what had done it . Then a rustling sound came from the willows . Jeff looked at the green hand of trees and stiffened . Black Jack shuffled out of the willows onto the bridge . The burlap sack of battles clinked as he set it on the footboards . Black Jack peered down the bridge and saw Jeff . " Hello , boy , " he said . His voice was hard . Jeff sat frozen still on the rail and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man 's face was red , with wrinkles black-lined with dirt . His long gray hair was matted over his ears and hung down from beneath his smashed hat . Red eyes looked out from under thick gray eyebrows . He wore baggy trousers and a dark and greasy suit coat ripped at the shoulder . He had old and horny hands . Black Jack leaned against the rail and looked down the marsh . Jeff sat unmoving on the rail . " I wonder if I ought to run ? " he thought . But if he ran down to the other end of the bridge lie would come out into the marshes and he was afraid he would get lost or fall into the quicksand Ken said was there . And he could n't get to the beach end of the bridge without passing Black Jack . He was afraid of the old man but he did n't want to leave and miss the flight . " Maybe he wo n't know me . " Jeff thought . " I hope he does n't remember me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand looking for bottles . They ran up the beach before him and found some bottles by a burned out campfire . They waited until the old man got almost to them , then they threw the bottles far out into the waves . Jeff wanted to stop them , but Ken ran near the old man and screamed at him , " You 're a tramp ! You 're a dirty tramp ! " Then Ken pulled out his slingshot and picked up a pebble EVENING from the sand and snapped it away . It hit Black Jack in the shoulder and he dropped the sack of bottles and started to chase Ken , half running , half shuffling in the soft sand . They all ran then , down the long beach near the water 's edge until the old man was just a small black shape behind them . Suddenly Black Jack stepped away from the bridge rail and  --  pointed out toward the lake . " Look there , " he said . Jeff looked up . Two specks cracked down over the marsh and flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marsh the ducks banked and turned and came back low over the bridge , wings straining against the air , heads out straight on long necks . They slid out across the bright water of the lake into the sun . The boy and the old man shaded their eyes with their hands and watched them until they were gone . " Them 's mallards , " Black Jack said . " I know it , " Jeff lied . " Anybody knows mal-lards . " Black Jack took off his hat and ran his hand through his matted gray hair . Then he looked at Jeff , who was staring at him with wide eyes . " You ever been here before , boy ? " " Sure , I 've been here lots of times . I 've been all through these marshes . " It was only the third time he had been there . There was the first night and then last night when he had asked his father to go with him to the bridge . He tried to tell his father about the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was too tired to walk all that way down the beach . " Why do n't you take Kenneth ? " his father said . " And you be careful about that old tramp who lives down there in the marsh . I do n't want you going near him . " Jeff did n't want to take Ken somehow . He did n't think Ken would like the place he had found , but he did take him , finally . " Hey , boy , " Black Jack said . " Ai n't you one of them kids who was pestering me the other night ? " Jeff sat stiffly on the rail and looked at the old man 's horny hands and the big burlap sack curled on the footboards . " Ai n't you one of them kids ? " " No . I never bothered you . I 've never seen you before . " Black Jack shuffled a few steps closer and peered at the boy with his small red eyes . Jeff gripped the rail and bit down on his lip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name is . IP " No . No , I do n't know him . " " Well , that kid 's no good . I better not ever get my hands on him . He 'll he sorry if I do . " Black Jack rubbed his hands on his dirty trousers and leaned against the rail again . Jeff relaxed his grip on the rail and sucked in a deep breath . When he had brought Ken to the marsh the night before to show him the flight , Ken stamped on the bridge and shook it and tried to break off a section of the rail , and Jeff began to wish that he had come alone . Later , after the flight began , Jeff looked over at Ken standing spread-legged. with his slingshot pulled hack the length of his ann . " Hey ! " Jeff cried , but the sling snapped and one of the birds dropped from the flock and fell softly onto the water . The small brown bird floated slowly down beneath them with its still wings stretched out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one veiled eye gazing up at them . " Here , " Ken said , holding out the sling , " You want to get one ? " " No . " Jeff watched the dead bird swing in slow circles on the water . " Do n't shoot any more , all right ? " And Ken did n't shoot any more , but the evening was spoiled for Jeff , so this night he had come to the bridge alone . Black Jack was fumbling in the deep pockets of his old coat . He brought out something wrapped in brown paper . He sloughed the paper off and took out a thick meat sandwich . He broke it in two and held one of the halves toward Jeff . You want a piece of samwich , boy ? " " No , thank you , " Jeff said . " I 'm not hungry . " The old man shrugged . He ate one of the halves of the sandwich , stuffing it into his mouth and licking his fingers afterward . Then he took a chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water below the bridge . The water swirled and splashed and the meat was gone . Jeff stared at the rippling water . Black Jack looked at him and grinned . " What was it ? " Jeff whispered . " Bass , " Black Jack said . " There 's big uns in here . Watch now . " He broke another piece from the sandwich and dropped it into the water . The swirl and splash again , and the meat was gone . " If you stand right here above ' em , " he said , " you can see ' em in the water . " Jeff hesitated , then climbed down from the rail and walked slowly down the bridge . A few feet from the old man he stopped and looked over the rail . His mouth opened in surprise . Two heavy dark shapes coasted in slow circles in the brown water below him . Black Jack dropped another piece of meat . Jeff saw one of the shapes circle near the floating meat , saw the muscle-handed tail snap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack dropped another piece and this time the other fish struck . Jeff stood on the bottom rail and leaned out to watch the two long shadows cruising in the dark . water . " Hey ! " Black Jack said . " You be careful you do n't fall in there , boy . " He held out the rest of the sandwich toward Jeff . " Here , boy . You want to feed ' em some ? " " No . " Jeff stepped down from the rail . " They are n't anything . They 're just old fish . " He moved back down the bridge a few feet and leaned against the rail and looked out across the dunes to the lake . The sun almost touched the waves . The flight would begin soon , Jeff thought . He wished that Black Jack would leave . If he stayed he would spoil it . " If you find something really nice , " the boy thought , " you want to tell somebody . You want somebody to see it with you and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do tell somebody they either do n't come like my father or they spoil it like Ken , so it 's better not to tell anybody and just watch it by yourself . " Black Jack scratched himself . " Birds 'll start coming up the marsh pretty soon now , " he said . " The sun is almost on the water , so they 'll start pretty soon , and you never seen so many birds . " " There 's not so many , " Jeff said . " I 've been here lots of times . This place is n't much . " " Well , maybe it 's not , " the old man said . " I always thought this was a pretty nice place , but I guess there 's plenty of places I ai n't ever been . " " Why ca n't he leave and not spoil it ? " Jeff thought . He remembered some of the things that his father and Ken 's father had said about Black Jack . Ken 's father said that he was a worthless old tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers did n't Iike to let their children go down to the beach alone with him always prowling around . B LACK Jack took a dark old pipe from the pocket of his coat and dipped it full from a cracked leather tobacco pouch . He struck a big wooden match on the rail and lit the pipe . He puffed out smoke , then suddenly pointed down the marsh with his pipestem . " Here they come , boy . Here come the first of t hem . " Jeff looked down the marsh and saw a group of specks grow into flying birds and whir in across the water . They passed low on straining wings over the man and the boy on the bridge . Another flock spun out of the cattails and then another and another . The low sun cut across the marsh and the world of the marsh turned butter-yellow in the evening light . The north wind came in from the lake and moved in the sweeping branches of the willows and rustled them , and the tall poplars standing down the marsh spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small brown birds came up out of the cattails and up out of the marshland and they filled the air with the rush of their soft wings and the high , thin sound of their voices . The flocks became larger and joined together and joined again and passed in streaming hundreds above the bridge . The old man moved down the bridge and leaned against the rail at Jeff 's side . The boy EVENING looked at him , then looked back to the flight . " What are they ? " " Red-wings. " the old man said . " I call ' em that , but it do n't matter much what the name is . " " But they are brown , " the boy said . " The wings are n't red at all . " " Them is just the mother birds . The mothers and the young ' uns . The fathers got red on the wings , but they left already . Gone South for the winter . These 'll go too , pretty soon now . " He pointed into the streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Watch them , how they race the sun . " Jeff looked up again . There were flocks no longer , just a great river of flying birds thrumming up out of the marsh and whirring over the bridge on soft dark wings . Jeff sat on the rail with his legs over the brown water and smelled the strong , rich smell of the old man 's pipe , and he saw the swallows cutting and skimming over the smooth water and whisking through the cattail clumps . He watched a pair of teal drop from high against a tower of clouds on fire in sunset and rifle in across the lake and over evening-yellow dunes and all the yellow burlap land of cattails and marsh grasses . And above the lake gulls turned on long , bent wings against the sun and dropped to the glittering waves . The sun was almost gone behind the edge of the water and the marsh turned from yellow into gray and only the tall poplars glittered yellow and silver down the last seconds of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flocks grew smaller and smaller as they strained up out of the dusk . The gray line of night moved up the yellow and silver of the poplars and then it reached the top and the yellow and silver were gone and out across the lake the sun was gone and in the air the birds were gone , and the air was empty and quiet . The boy and the old man on the bridge were silent . The old man drew on his pipe and blew the smoke out into the air ; the boy swung his legs and looked down at the water below them . " I wonder where they all go ? " he said . " To find some place to sleep , some place to spend the night , " the old man said . " I do n't know where they go , exactly , but I like to watch them here at evening when they fly the marsh . Look there , boy . There 's the first bat . You see him ? " Jeff saw the bat spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's fast , " Jeff said . " I did n't know they were so fast . I 've never seen one before . " They stayed on the bridge for a while , watching the bat , then the old man knocked out his pipe against the rail . " Be dark pretty soon , boy . You want to walk back down the beach with me ? " Jeff looked at the old man and hesitated for a moment . Then , " No , " he said . do n't go home along the beach . I go across the bridge and through the marshes . I do n't care about the dark anyway . " " All right , boy . If you can find your way . Good night now . " The old man shuffled back down the bridge and picked up his clinking sack of bottles , then went down into the willows and was gone . Jeff sat on the rail with his chin in his hands and looked down at the water . He sat there for a while and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willows . He crossed the meadow and went in among the dunes . He walked slowly along the path , his hands jammed down in his pockets . When he reached the beach he saw something dark and shiny half buried in the sand . He stopped and kicked at it with his tennis shoe , then reached down and picked it up . He held it in his hand and stood there looking at it for a long time , and then he looked up , and he ran , ran down the long beach in the dusk after the small dark figure far ahead of him , holding the bottle to his chest .  - -   - -   - ) .  - -  i. ; , ? ?
