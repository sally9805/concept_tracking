txt To THE EDITOR OF ; THE New YORK Timm Your editorial on . Feb. 3 " It Ca n't Be Said Too Often " fails to appreciate Senator 's speech on Feb. 1 in the Senate on the hydrogen bomb . This speech , magnificent in scope , penetrating-in analysis and boldly courageous , is surely one of the most significant speeches - 'to collie- from the Senate in a long time . Indeed , it is one of the most important pronouncements to be made on the control of atomic energy since the bomh was dropped on Hiroshima . Senator proposes a realistic ' five-year plan for peace . He , suggests that two-thirds of the $15 billion now being spent for " sterile armaments " be used annually to foster peace throughout the world . Your counter-proposal that President Truman make a fireside chat is inadequate . It would be helpful in persuading qur friends in Europe of our good intentions ; it would do nothing to mollify our foes . We need to wage " atomic peace , " as Senator proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he justly observes , the Voice of America is only a whisper . We show ourselves unable to cope with the psychological and political strategies of . the Soviet Union . We steadily retreat in Asia and we have lost the cold war in Eastern Europe . In the face of these defeats , the . State Department too busily exhausts itself justifying these losses rather than straining to define a clear and dynamic global policy . A fireside chat will hardly answer Soviet revolutionary propaganda . Your editorial raises the question : " Are we , then , to lend money to Russia in order that she may strengthen her form of society to the ultimate ruin of our form of society ? To raise the question in that shape is to . answer it  --  and the answer would be no . " Too easily you pass by the Senator 's economic and political proposals  --  too easily you close the door on any possible approach to better relations with Russia . . Let us take a sensible view of the situation . Any world economic program must include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations must also include Russia . Such financial aid as the United States might provide might offer a means of reviving trade between Eastern and Western Europe and so strengthen the foundations of peace . More important than his economic scheme is the Senator 's political program . He proposes to work through the United Nations , the only possible body which can give representation to all peoples . His global Marshall Plan , making use of atomic energy to build rather than to destroy , bears a strong humanitarian ' impulse , which has long motivated democracy . For the first time a democratic statesman has made a specific proposal that is able to challenge the promises made by the Communists . And more important , our economic greatness will enable us to deliver ' the goods .. To increase and maintain our own economic strength , and to enlarge our faith in democracy , require such a dynamic leadership.as Senator has laid before the Senate . R. G. COWHERD , Assistant Professor of History and Government , Lehigh University . Bethlehem , Pa. , Feb. 8 , 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW YORK TIMES : After studying Army Secretary Gray 's revision of the 1946 " Utilization of Negro Manpower " circular , I have come- to the conclusion that THE TIMES editorial which hailed this new ' policy immediately after its promulgation was over-enthusiastic and precipitate . Will .. readily admit that in some , respects the new ' ' order appears to be a step - in the right ' direction . However , it " seems logical to ' analyze it in terms of what it does net ' o . Obviously , the Army does not intend to , abolish its racist quota system or its segregation , It makes this - plain when Mr. Gray tells us that a relative handful of " ROTC students * * * will remain together and be trained together without regard to race or color . " Under the order the only other Negroes to be integrated into white units are " scarce specialists . " Moreover , the . order , itself is vague . We have become suspicious of language which is susceptible to loose application . , We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality remains . that Jim Crow in the Army is- still with us and going strong .  - -  What we need , - if our democratic way of life is to attain frill  --  maturity , is an order clearly spelled . out , . effectively ' and specifically administered and rigidly ' enforced . Negroes in America , especially=those armed forces , can no longer be fooled With a semi=sop , even when released from the Pentagon with considerable = rhetoric . The armed services of America , dedicated to the defense of democracy , should lead the way in thii3 fight for decency and individual dignity . The Army certainly is not living up to its full responsibility in this respect when it issues an order which at best pays ineffectual lip service to the problem of racism in America . , A. PHILIP RANDOLPH , Co-Chairman , ' Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service and Training . New York , Feb. 7 , 1950 . Up : to New Yorkers To THE EDITOR OF THE Maw YORK TIES ; In the days of William ? Allen White ; editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MCKirtley ' campaign in 1896 there appeared an editorial ' written by White entitled " What Is , the . Matter . With Kansas had wide impiications . Thomas B. Reed , Speaker of the House , wrote White : " I have n't seen as much common Renee in one column in a dozen years . " It became a slogan and stirred up the Kansans to a general clearing up of their affairs . Now I , who- am thinking , night and day of the water situation in New York City , . ask " What , is the matter with New Yorkers ? " Undoubtedly trio . intelligent citizenry of New York City realize that it will take many months of most strenuous economy , to pull us ' through this water crisis and are conscientiously , going without . For two years the reservoirs have been dangerously low . Be it said in shame of those having the Matter in charge that nothing was done about it . It is to be hoped that thb city fathers will soon make provision for a larger supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep strict guard over faucets . We do n't want to be selfish or , inadequate in this emergency and have people ask , " What is the matter with New Yorkers " ? do we ? Or are we not civic-minded ? MARY MCKELVEY . NOW York , Feb. 9 , 1950 . Afghanistan and Pakistan Government Spokesman of the Former Replies to Recent Statements To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMES : The statement by Reyaz-ul-Hasan , Information Officer , Press Department , Government of Pakistan , following Robert Trumbull 's dispatch from Karachi to New York published in your issue of Feb. 8 was really amusing . The tone of the letter reminds one , in a way , of Shakespeare 's Nym and Pistol . Everybody knows what the humor of it is . However , one wonders whom one can trust if even a correspondent of a free press of an impartial and equally friendly ' country like the United States and an observer on the spot is accused of misstatement . It is clever propaganda , if one can afford it , to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self into a sense of false security by putting one 's head in the sand . The so-called " internationally recognized boundary of Pakistan " mentioned in Mr. Reyaz-ul-Hasan 's letter is the boundary of that country which has never been recognized ' by its neighbor across the border. , The so-called Durand Line , which was intended by the British to delimit the boundary between Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier  --  the territory between the Durand Line and the British administrative line ? was never annexed to British India and had a status of a British protectorate . In July , 1949 , the Afghan Parliament declared that " it does not recognize the imaginary Durand or any similar line . " The free Pushtunistan movement and the establishment of their own Government by the Pushtuns at , Tirah is so obvious that I would like to leave ' it to ? the judgment of impartial- correspondents and eyewitnesses , if only the Government of Pakistan would give the international press the right and the facilities for reporting on- what the situation is in that part of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , it could take against Afghanistan , some of which have been reported by your own correspondents . It is not true that the Afghan radio and press have launched any propaganda except that they have answered the Pakistan radio and press in the same manner as I answer Mr. Reyazul-Hasan 's statement , and as I have done twice before in my correspondence with you . We do not wish to create any trouble nor to be called a " naughty boy " by those who force , our hand , neither do we expect those who are too young to advise to warn us of the consequences of acts for which ' they are themselves , responsible .

Refuse Collectors Blamed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Although I am in complete agreement with the city 's present drive to clean up its streets , I feel a certain sense of unfairness in the fining of many ordinary citizens when some of our most expert street-litterers are city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department at that ! In my neighborhood , Riverside Drive and 100th Street , much of the litter on the streets is caused by the poor aim of the refuse collectors . They carelessly , but consistently , manage to miss their collection trucks with a . goodly portion of the daily collection . Possibly target Practice:for refuse collectors should be made ae Dart of- the present cleanliness campaign . ARTHUR V. SMITH . NOW York , Feb. 10 , 1950 . Aid in Securing Jobs After 45 To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK . Tuns : A bill is now before the- New . York State Legislature , introduced by Senator Desmond and Assemblyman Stuart , to set up machinery to aid men and women 45 years of age or over to obtain jobs to support themselves . The suicide rate among this age group is high . Primitive people bury this group alive , but here it is " agin " the law , " so it costs too much to live and you ca n't afford to die .
