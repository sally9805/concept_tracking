In the face of spiraling costs , many a U.S. daily has died in the last ten years , and few new ones have been born . Three months ago , in Tallahassee , Fla. ( pop . 38,002 ) , Leo William Bowmall , vice president of Manhattan 's Bulkley Dunton Pulp Co. , decided to try to buck the trend . He and other backers put up more than $250,000 to launch the Tallahassee Capital Post , to compete with the 50-year old Tallahassee Democrat ( circ. 14,014 ) . Last week , after barely 68 days of life , the new paper died . Even though the Post was small , with a circulation of a little more than 4,000 , losses ran as high as $1,000 a day . When Backer Bowmall suspended last week , $30,000 in operating capital had already gone into the tiny paper . Said he : " The cost of production was much higher than we expected .
