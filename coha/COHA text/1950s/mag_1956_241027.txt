Dear TIME-Reader : <P> IN THE six years since TIME began publishing full-color reproductions each week in the Art section , the editors have been struck time and again by the strength and vitality of native U.S. art . Along with the foreign painting , sculpture and architecture , from the ancient Egyptians and Etruscans to the latest sculpture from Paris , TIME has recorded the history and day-to-day ferment of American paintings , from the untutored journeyman portraitists of colonial days to the explosive abstract expressionists . Among the almost 700 full-color reproductions printed since 1951 , some 200 were of American paintings , the most extensive color survey of U.S. art now available . <P> The two editors most concerned with the subject are Associate Editors Alexander Eliot and Cranston Jones . Eliot , a onetime painter himself , who had his first show when he was 17 and directed a <P> Boston gallery at 20 , began to write Art for TIME in 1945 . Jones came to the section two years ago , after assignments as a TIME correspondent in San Francisco , London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , as one TIME reader puts it , has been to establish " a museum of the mind , where feet never grow tired and the light is always just right . " <P> Says Editor Eliot : " American art has been shaped by American forces . Its viewpoints and subject matter are its own , and they open a thousand windows on our heritage . By reproducing these works , TIME has added an American wing to our ' museum of the mind . ' " <P> Next week , in the Christmas issue , TIME will open another gallery in that American wing with a special eight-page color portfolio of works by American artists , from John Singleton Copley and the painting Peale family ( see cut ) to Edward Hopper . <P> Cordially yours ,
