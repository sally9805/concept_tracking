Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Senator Brien 's proposal that the persons responsible for the attack on Southern Korea be tried as war criminals under the Nuremberg precedent did not suggest any details of procedure other than that the names of the individuals " directly responsible for precipitating this conflict be sent to the United Nations . " A proper procedural application by the United Nations of the principles of international law may yet strengthen the sanctions now being invoked and perhaps furnish a legal and moral deterrent for aggravating this unlawful invasion and aggression . The crime for initiating the aggres-sion has already been committed and the persons responsible for participating in its planning and preparation are readily identifiable . The more important problem , it seems to me , is to announce the standards of international law which are designed to limit and contain an aggression already launched . The Nuremberg precedent provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illegal invasions is a separate and distinct crime . Thus persons who did not participate in the planning and preparation to initiate wars of aggression may be held criminally responsible if , knowing that the war was aggressive , they substantially participate in its waging . The Nuremberg Tribunal in the Ministries case stated : " We are not to be understood as holding that one who knows that a war of aggression has been initiated is to be relieved of criminal responsibility if he thereafter wages it . * * * " Limited Application Following World War II , the application of the concept ' of the " waging " of aggressive war , as a- separate and distinct crime , was difficult , because of the requirement that there be proof of knowledge on the part of the participant that the war was aggressive . Consequently its application was necessarily limited to those who substantially participated in the planning and preparation for the aggressive war . Today the situation is different . A competent international authority has already determined " that the armed attack upon the Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace . " We now have an official declaration by the United Nations that the attack on South Korea was aggressive and criminal . Any person who hereafter substantially participates in the waging of the war and invasion of Southern Korea must be charged with knowledge of the fact that he is participating in the waging of an aggressive war and illegal invasion , regardless of whether he participated in the preparations for its initiation or not . It would be most appropriate for the United Nations to adopt at this time a resolution to the effect that under existing law all persons holding high position who participate in the waging of aggressive war or unlawful invasions are criminally responsible therefor ; that the attack on South Korea constitutes an unlawful invasion and an act of aggression ; that all persons holding high position who continue to participate in the unlawful invasion and aggression against South Korea will be held responsible before an international tribunal . Supplementary Sanctions Such a declaration by the United Nations may perhaps plant a seed of hesitancy in the minds of the North Korean officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage war in the face of the United Nations declaration . It would certainly supple-e ment the military sanctions with the legal and moral sanctions of international law . The impact of such a declaration would not be entirely lost on the Soviet legal mind . The published minutes of the International Conference on Military Tribunals disclose that the Soviet delegate attached great importance to the Allied declarations at Crimea and Moscow providing for the trial and punishment of Axis war criminals . In fact , we thought they overstressed the legal effect of those declarations . MORRIS AMC HAN " . Former Deputy Chief Counsel for War Crimes , Nuremberg . Arlington , Va. , June 30 , 1950 . Senator Graham 's Defeat TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRx TIMES : Lawrence Rogin of the Textile Workers Union takes issue with your II editorial on the North Carolina Sena ' torial election , stating that " it missed the basic importance . " Then he labors the F. E. P. C. question as the reason for Senator Graham 's defeat . I suggest that it is Mr. Rogin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the union political leaders would dictate that they look in the mirror for the reasons elections go as they do . The truth is that every time Rogin and his crowd get out in front in an election , the voters knock them down . Reports from Florida and Carolina indicate that the " carpetbaggers " brought out more Smathers and Smith votes than any other issue . If the F. E. P. C. issue was important , they helped dramatize it and give it a bad symbol . The only national election the Re , publican party has won since 1928 was in 1946 , when Sidney Hillman 's P. A. C. was a spectacular issue squarely faced . It was obvious from the returns in industrial districts that the G. 0 . P. could not have won Congress if union members had taken orders from the self-anointed political dictators . TaftHartley is dead as an issue despite union leader tom-toms . Unquestionably the arrogance of labor leaders In Ohio has turned the scales for Senator Taft and driven Democratic Governor Lausche to take an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremens dous membership in Detroit , takes regular lickings at the polls . The moral is that union members . like other Americans , resent efforts &I; give orders in the voting booths . There is an object-lesson for the unions in employers who , years ago , tried to vote their employes . JAMES P. SELVAGE . New York . June 30. 1950 . To Aid Undeveloped Areas Role of Private Agencies in Point Four Program Considered To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIBIESl Recently you published President Truman 's address to the American Newspaper Guild Convention . It included as an example of what Point Four can mean , some of the work of the Near East Foundation . As I read the address , I was impressed with the fact that there are two distinct fields of work involved in the Point Four Program , One is what the Government can do and the other is what voluntary agencies can do . In the long run it may be that what is done voluntarily by our people will have the best effect . In these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to do big things in a big way . ' If I could write in the sky over America , I would . write these words ? " The Government can not do everything . " There are certain things which only individuals acting together through a voluntary agency can accomplish . The recipients of this help feel the spirit of democracy and good-will and they understand more easily what we in America are trying to accomplish . A Government agency with all good intentions , nevertheless , starts out with one strike against it for the very fact that most people of undeveloped areas are suspicious of any kind of government activity . Americans must never forget that voluntary groups must be supported by voluntary and generous gifts of money or service . The good work mentioned in the President 's address can only go on with adequate voluntary financial support . The Near East Foundation has no great capital investments . It has spent every dollar it could gather each year for immediate , constructive , and pressing programs in the Near East ever since World War I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We can greatly enlarge the scope of these activities . " I agree . We can , but part of it we must accomplish through generosity and part through taxation . LINCOLN D. KELSEY , Professor in Extension Service , New York State College of Agriculture . Ithaca , N. Y. , July 5 , 1950 . Judging Korean War Guilt Nuremberg , Precedent for Defining Criminal Responsibility Quoted Religious Authority in Israel To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The statement by Dr. Jacob R. Marcus of Cincinnati , president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis , to the effect that certain rabbis " are denied complete religious equality in Israel , " which was reported in TILE NVANT YOR.Ii . TIMMS recently , gives an incorrect impression of the status of religious authority in the State of Israel . Having personally discussed this matter with the office of the Ministry of Religions during my recent visit to Israel , I was informed that all rabbis who meet the qualifications required of members of the Rabbinate in Israel and possess the degree of " Smicha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of study of Biblical and Rabbinic law , are granted full rights and privileges by the Ministry of Religions . It is , therefore , not a question of " discrimination " but that of meeting the standards which have prevailed in the Holy Land since time immemorial . The laws in Israel on this question are similar to the laws governing medical and legal standards set by the various states in the United States before licenses for practice are granted . DR . ISRAEL TABAR , Honorary President , Rabbinical Council , of America . New York , June 22 , 1950 . Use of Firecrackers Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Whatever became of the ordinance against the use of firecrackers in New York City ? Or do n't we have one any more ? Judging from the " bombing " to which the city was subjected the night of the Fourth I would guess not .. , M. BERNICE WHEELER . New York , July 4 , 1950.                @ @ @ @ @
