" If this is getting ready for peace , " said one wounded , worn-out U.S. rifleman last week , " I 'd just as soon go back to the old war . " To the U.S. 3rd Division on the central front , and to ROK 5th and 8th Division troops farther east , the approach of peace had brought the bitterest , bloodiest battles in months . <P> <P> Outpost Harry , where the week 's heavy fighting started , juts deep into enemy territory and towers over U.N . positions on the Chorwon Valley floor . Should the Chinese capture Harry , the U.N . would have to move its main line of resistance back as much as two miles . The day after the Chinese struck at the hill , the order came down from Eighth Army Commander Maxwell Taylor : " Hold Harry at all cost . " <P> Night on Old Harry . The cost was high . King Company , 15th ( " Can Do " ) Regiment , lay in 30 bunkers atop the ugly , sausage-shaped ridge the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion of Chinese scrambled up the dusty , littered slopes of Harry . Battling hand to hand in their crumbling trenches , the outnumbered G.I.s drove the Reds off . The shelling continued . One by one , the bunkers collapsed , covering American and Chinese bodies with sand and dust . King was reinforced ; the Reds attacked again &; again . During the night , 20,000 artillery and mortar shells had exploded in an area smaller than Times Square . But the hill remained in U.S. hands . <P> On the second and third nights , the Chinese swept down on Harry in regimental strength . Each time they were thrown back . Red casualties as estimated : 3,400 . U.S. casualties on Harry : " extremely heavy . " <P> Death on Capitol Hill . While Harry held , South Koreans to the east were in serious trouble . One night a Chinese regiment drove through to the ROK 5th Division main line north of the Hwachon Reservoir , breached it in four places . Two days later , the Reds struck again , captured Capitol Hill from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main assault . Thousands of Red troops ( some estimates were as high as 25,000 ) , supported by tanks and artillery , poured over the ROKs in the Capitol Hill and Outpost Texas sectors . At one point , the ROKs fell back two miles . It was the biggest retreat the U.N . has made in Korea in two years . One difficulty was that commanders of new ROK divisions , for fear of losing face , had failed to report how serious a jam they were in until it was too late to help . <P> To ROK prestige and Syngman Rhee 's boasts of marching to the Yalu , the east front setback was a severe blow . Just how seriously it affects U.N . defenses for an armistice is another matter , obscured in military censorship . <P> As the cease-fire approached , 3rd Division helicopters skittered through the green valleys , carrying the wounded to the crowded surgical hospital a few miles from Outpost Harry . There , a weary Army nurse waved her arm at a row of cots filled with bloody , groaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace to you ? "
