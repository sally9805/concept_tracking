The Eighth Army last week was fighting about as hard as it was possible to fight without launching an all-out offensive - which the U.N . generals had no intention of doing just yet . The Eighth was engaged in a series of local " limited offensives " which had three aims : 1 ) to push the Reds off strategic high ground ; 2 ) to kill as many of them as possible ; 3 ) to knock their big buildup off balance . <P> The Communists were obviously hurt . Their propaganda complained that Van Fleet 's attacks were " openly inviting war " - a pointless accusation , in view of the fact that it was agreed when the truce talks started that the war would continue until a cease-fire was signed &; sealed . <P> On the east-central front , around an embattled hollow nicknamed the Punchbowl , U.S. Marines made the deepest U.N . penetrations into North Korea since last December . Wielding flamethrowers and bayonets , aided by planes , Army artillery and tanks , the leathernecks clawed their way up towering crags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back doggedly , but the flamethrowers finally made the Reds break and run . <P> In the center and east , Communist counterattacks were fierce and frequent , forced temporary U.N . pullbacks . But U.N . artillery did not let the Reds get very far . " Bloody Ridge , " occupied last fortnight after heavy fighting , was still in U.S. hands . At new bloody ridges , Red assaults were met by the heaviest U.N . barrage in six weeks . <P> Pugnacious General James Van Fleet " was eager for the Communists to jump off with their offensive - if they were ever going to . Said he grimly : " A Communist offensive would give us the chance to slaughter them . That way we could get them in wholesale lots , and not have to kick them piecemeal out of the hills the way we are doing now . "
