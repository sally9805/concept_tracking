Theobald , 53 , has no degree in education and never taught in a public school , but as the energetic president of municipal Queens College and more recently as New York 's deputy mayor , he has come to know as much about his city and its huge ( 1,000,000 pupils ) school system as any man .

He became professor of engineering , then dean of administration at City College , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago he left Queens on leave to become deputy mayor to his old friend Bob Wagner , the son of his father 's classmate at City College . <P> A tough-minded but genial realist who coached track while president of Queens , likes to do carpentry and fiddle on the violin , Theobald combines a certain sympathy for modern educational theories with a no-nonsense attitude towards such practices as promoting all students automatically .
