txt Federal Judge Robert P. Anderson today granted a permanent injunction barring the State of Massachusetts from interfering with the shutdown of passenger service on the Old Colony line of the New Haven Railroad . The Injunction , he announced in open court , will be filed July 8 . Meantime , a temporary injunction will remain in force . In addition , the judge dissolved a temporary injunction against the New Haven Railroad , that forced it to continue passenger service . Judge Anderson said he was satisfied that the losses of the New Haven on the 10,000-commuter Old Colony line had been far in excess of one million dollars a year over a long period . Moreover , he said , he noted that losses for 1957 were approximately two million dollars . He said he saw no reason to believe such losses would not continue . Therefore , he added , he would dissolve the injunction against the railroad and make permanent the one against Massachusetts .                   @ @
