txt Here 's the word for harassed businessmen and others who are finding it tough to borrow from banks : Things wo n't be getting much worse . The Federal Reserve System is highly pleased with the current bareness of the banks ' money cupboards . which has resulted in higher borrowing costs for everyone from filling-station operators to major oil companies . But it sees no need to let the screws tighten still more . This cheerful word comes from New York bankers who are confident that they know the Federal Reserve System 's views . It 's of major importance to every businessman . Interest rates , of course , could creep higher . That 's a matter for determination by banks and other lenders . But , if the scarcity of funds is not allowed to get worse , the chances for additional rate increases certainly are lessened . Federal Reserve credit policy early last year was still one of neutrality  --  the System was doing nothing to feed funds into the banks and nothing to pull them out As the demands of borrowers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of ope of mild restraint . As credit demands have continued to bulk large this year , the policy has had the effect of severe restraint . The Federal Reserve System 's primary purpose has been to make the banks reluctant to lend . This they have accomplished , and in doing so , obviously , they have made it tough  --  and increasingly expensive  --  for businessmen to borrow . Changed Policy " Inevitable " If the current money market tightness continues , the bankers say , Federal Reserve action is inevitable within the next three months . Two factors will be chiefly responsible : The Federal Government during the last half of this year may have to borrow as much as $7 billion from the commercial banks . If the banks are to buy these securities , the Reserve System will have to supply them with funds . In addition . the usual seasonal expansion of business loan demand will begin in July or early . August , as farm crops begin to move to market . One of the principal purposes for watch the Federal Reserve System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . Here 's how the Reserve System regulates the banks ' funds : By law , member banks of the Federal Reserve System are required to keep in a Reserve Bank cash equal in amount to a fixed percentage of the deposits they owe their customers . If the latter deposits increase , the required amount of cash they keep in the Reserve Bank must be increased ; if such deposits decrease , the reserve can be reduced . Since reserves thus limit deposits , they also limit loans , because of the manner in which the banks make loans . If you borrow money ? from a bank , it usually does n't give you the cash , but sets up for you a deposit against which you Gan draw checks . This increases the bank 's deposits . The Reserve System can hand out additional reserves to the banks in three principal ways : By purchasing Government securities in the open market , by lending the banks cash , or by reducing their reserve requirements . Buying Government Securities Purchases of Government securities give the banks reserves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dealer with a check . The dealer deposits the check in his bank , which sends it to a Federal Reserve Bank . The Reserve Bank &hen; credits the reserve account of the dealer 's bank with the amount of the check . New York bankers believe the System will rely mainly on Government securities purchases to prevent further tightening of the money market later this year . They also assume the banks will gain additional reserves by increasing their borrowing from the System . Changes in reserve requirements , they believe , would be only a last resort . The System has the authority to change the percentages of these requirements , within specific limits . The System , according to these bankers , regards changes in reserve requirements as too much of a " blunt instrument . " In other words , such changes would aid all banks , not just those most in need of aid . Purchases of Government securities , on the other hand , would chiefly help banks in New York and Chicago , where the money shortage is the greatest . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business loan demand this fall is sure , the bankers insist Last autumn , while the Federal Reserve was in the process of building up the present tight situation , it still was putting some funds into the banks for that purpose . In the last MX months of last year , the System increased its holdings of Government securities by over $2 billion . At the same time , loans extended to member banks rose by over $1 billion . Interest Rates NEW HAVEN , Conn. ? The present level of interest rates does not result in excessive earnings for banks and other creditors , an American Bankers Association official declared . Dr. E. Sherman Adams , deputy manager in charge of the A.B.A. 's department on monetary policy , told the trust conference of the Connecticut Bankers Association here that " for about two decades , borrowers have never had it so good . " " Last year . despite the improvement that had taken place in interest rates , leading life insurance companies reported an average return of only 3.28% on their Invested assets , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning-to commercial banks . he said there has been an " unprecedented expansion " in the volume of bank loans at rising interest rates during recent years . " but most of the increase in bank earnings has gone to pay for greatly increased costs of banking operations . Net profits of all member banks ( of the Federal Reserve System ) amounted to 8.3% of capital accounts in 1950 , 7.6% in 1951 , and about 8% in 1952. "
