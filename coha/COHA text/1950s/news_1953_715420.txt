txt . On April 8 , last , the Treasury announced its plans for marketing a thirty-year issue of 3% per cent bonds . Five days later , it may be recalled , a group of nine United States Senators , most of them long identified with the cause of perpetually easy money , issued a joint statement protesting this plan for restoring the free market in the field of Government finance . They urged Secretary Humphrey to withdraw the offering , " pending full study and debate . " The Administration , these legislators charged , was adopting a " new , highinterest , dear-money policy , which would be deflationary , which would cost the Government $225 millions in unnecessary interest charges , and would make credit more costly and less available to farmers , home buyers , businesses , municipalities and borrowers generally . " The principal beneficiaries of " this unnecessary and gratuitous 30 per cent increase in long-term Government interest offerings , " they added , would be " banks and insurance companies . " Senator Morse of Oregon , amplifying this statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " phony " the argument that the higher interest rate would be anti-inflationary . It would not have " nearly the effect , " he said , " that the recognition on the part of the people of their patriotic duty to set aside and take out of the stream of inflationary spending a certain amount of national wealth in terms of loose cash would have . " As we noted here at the time , it was a little appalling to find that at this late date even this small minority of United States Senators could have missed so completely the entire significance of the Federal Reserve-Treasury controversy or could have been so unaware of the tidal wave of public opinion that had forced the Treasury to capitulate . By way of a footnote to this comment we now add one or two excerpts from a particularly comprehensive discussion of the subject appearing in the May issue of the " Monthly Letter " of the National City Bank of New York . Dealing specifically with what might be . called - the - " unnecessary and- gratuitous " dictum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe : ? Since 1935 Savings bonds have been continuously available to attract the citizen 's " loose cash . " In recent years it has been difficult to sell enough to cover redemptions . It is well and good to speak of " patriotic duty " but Government also has a duty to pay off in good coin . Inflationary financing policies have been a tax , taking from the saver the rate of return promised him . It is a sobering fact that no Savings bond held to maturity has yet given to a buyer the amount of purchasing power he gave up when he made the purchase . As to- the notion that the 3Y4. per , cent interest rate was calculated to benefit the " favored pew , " - this study . shows in considerable detail why the exact contrary is the case  --  how such benefits " span out to the rank ? and file of citizens . " " Indeed , " it concludes , " so far as these benefits are the product of policies to defend the dollar I-they give a breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of inflation  --  the man struggling to live on a fixed income or on the income from a fixed fund of savings .
