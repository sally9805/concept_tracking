THE CONGRESS New Tracks For years , California politicos have assumed that Governor Earl Warren was grooming State Comptroller Thomas Henry Kuchel ( pronounced Kee-kul ) to succeed him as governor . Kuchel , a slight , friendly man , is one of the governor 's closest political and personal friends , received his present post six years ago through Warren 's largess , and has not only gone down the line politically for his benefactor , but has done an outstanding job as bursar of California 's billion-dollar budget . Last week , however , the governor switched his protege to a new track , appointed him to the U.S. Senate to succeed Vice President-elect Richard Nixon . <P> The new Senator , now 42 , was born in Anaheim ( pop . 15,000 ) , Calif. , son of the pioneer publisher of the Anaheim Gazette , a daily newspaper still operated as a family enterprise . He worked as a printer 's devil when he was a boy , went to the University of Southern California , where he ran as a sprinter on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1936 , served two terms as a state legislator , two as a state senator . At 30 , he was chairman of the California Republican Central Committee-the youngest in state history . <P> His appointment last week was made amid a general atmosphere of financial sacrifice . Nixon dated his resignation Jan . <P> i to give Kuchel seniority over other freshmen Senators , who will take office on Jan. 3 . In so doing , Nixon is cutting his term of congressional service just short of six years , and abandoning chances of drawing a congressional pension . Kuchel is accepting a salary cut-from $16,000 a year to $12,500-to take his new post in the Senate . Without diluting his loyalty to Governor Warren , Kuchel is also accepting new political fealty . " I am now , " he said last week , " a middle-of-the-road Eisenhower Republican . "
