The Russians had departed , and the world was busy examining Britain to see what damage had been done . <P> " Ten days that failed to shake the world , " the London Economist called it . The visitors had not made off with the heart of the British common man-something Khrushchev had badly wanted to take home as another trophy from his diplomatic safaris . Through most of the visit , B. &; K. remained remote and formidable figures in big black cars behind a 21-motorcycle escort ( a sight hitherto unknown in Britain ) , but they soon sensed in the public 's cool reserve that they were not being officiously sealed off from the kind of hysterical triumph they had scored in India . <P> At this point Khrushchev lost his aplomb , and in revealing flashes of anger exposed the harsh Communist behind the beaming clown . His denunciation of Social Democrats played hob with the Communists ' seductive pleas for a Popular Front ( see box ) ; his truculent assertion of Russian nuclear capacity spoiled his peace-loving professions , and stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The British consensus is that Georgy Malenkov is an able fellow and Bulganin an amiable second-rater , but that Khrushchev is a crude , crafty and headlong ruler who must be watched and can not be trusted . <P> Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden came out of the whole thing looking better . The original invitation might have been a mistake , but the good sense of the British public and the steadfastness of the British government in its devotion to the Western alliance rendered baseless most of the earlier fears . <P> Though frustrated of popular success , B. &; K. had managed to leave behind an impressive demonstration of the strength and technical achievement of Russia itself . They had failed miserably at conveying the impression of likable old fellows who meant no harm and who had never killed anybody in their lives . In the testing place of a free society , the Kremlin 's dictators had been subjected to a cold , revealing light of exposure .                    @
