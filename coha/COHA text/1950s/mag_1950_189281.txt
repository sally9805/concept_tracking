( See Cover ) <P> " And here 's that man himself , " cried the announcer- " Arthur , **29;6916;TOOLONG , Godfrey ! " Wearing his earphones , a swept-up shock of copper hair and a winning , country-boy grin that belied his 46 years , the big-shouldered man at the desk shifted a candy wafer in his mouth and asked plaintively : " Now what am I gon na do with the last half of this Life Saver ? " <P> Before Godfrey , such words on a commercial program ( sponsored by Toni , Inc. , in this case ) might have cost a radio performer his job . No one on the network air ever had the unbuttoned nerve to talk with his mouth full , use sloppy diction , give free plugs to non-sponsoring products or blithely ad-lib whatever popped into mind . <P> Beyond such calculated flaunting of the rules of radio and TV , the thing that makes Arthur Godfrey remarkable as a hit entertainer is his relative lack of definable talent . He can neither sing , dance , act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet today he is the top moneymaker and the outstanding personality on the air . From radio and TV , records , business investments , stocks &; bonds , and other odds &; ends , he gets close to $1,000,000 a year . He earns $1,500 for every minute he broadcasts . He is seen &; heard-and apparently loved-by 40 million people . His homey , cracker-barrel commercials for tea , cigarettes , furniture polish , floor wax , window cleanser , crackers , shampoos , soup , home permanents , hand lotion and hair tonic set cash registers jingling profitably across the nation . He is the greatest salesman who ever stood before a microphone . <P> Lifted Eyebrow . Not even Godfrey himself can quite explain how he does it . Some students of what the public likes profess to see the answer in the " shine of naturalness " reflected by his use of such words as " doggone , " " ai n't " and " got ta " - the sort of determinedly rustic phrasing which led Fred Allen to call Godfrey " the man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice has been variously described as " warty , " " briery , " " wood-raspy , " and even " like a shoebox full of bullfrogs . " <P> A few more cynical observers think that Godfrey 's greatest audience bait is the faintly smutty double meaning . " Godfrey can do more with the lift of an eyebrow than De Maupassant could with a volume , " says one adman . " Whenever he ad-libs he talks himself right into the bathroom . " Such scatological shockers as the miniature outhouse he used as a TV prop invariably explode titillated giggles in his studio and television audiences . <P> Godfrey himself can find but one explanation for his success : " It 's because people believe in me . How the hell else can you explain it ? " To CBS Board Chairman William Paley , Godfrey " is the kind of guy the average man would like to behe 's a wistful projection of the average guy . " An NBC vice president says enviously : " Berle 's a comedian , but he 's only good once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and you 'd never get tired looking at him . "
