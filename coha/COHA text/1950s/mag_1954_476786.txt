A LITERARY critic can discuss detective stories without being called before the hoard of governors , but the even snore popular form of packaged fiction called the Western appears to be off limits . I have found only one serious discussion of Westerns and that one is not by an articled critic but by Mr. W. H. Hutchinson , the bibliographer of Eugene Manlove Rhodes. * Mr. Hutchinson has laid a foundation for criticism to build on whenever inquiry into the subject becomes proper . In somewhat enlarging his thesis here I confine myself , as he did , to the principal form of Westerns , the novel about cowboys and the Cattle Kingdom . The horse opera . Back in 1938 I pointed out that only Gene Rhodes had succeeded in making first-rate fiction out of the cattle business . The statement still stands but the argument would be tighter if Mr. Walter Van Tilburg Clark had not meanwhile published an excellent novel called The Oxbow Incident . Some of its characters are cowboys and it has rustlers and a sheriff . But Mr. Clark 's subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So his scene might be almost anywhere and though he uses a few stage properties from horse opera , he uses none of its sentiments or traditions . We may ask why . Set down the names of some other contemporary novelists who have written good fiction about the West , say Edwin Corle , H. L. Davis , Harvey Fergusson , and A. B. Guthrie . Why have not such men , if only in a mood of curiosity and experiment , applied their talents to the cliche- " Virgins , Villains and Varmints " in the Hunting-tun Library Quarterly , August 1953. ridden form to see if they could give it some life ? Well , Mr. Guthrie did in his first novel , or at least that novel is horse opera . He will not thank me for recalling it but since it has been reprinted as a pocket book it is in the open view . It is wrought out of the conventions of the genre , it has none of the qualities of The Big Sky or The Way West , and it does not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be necessary for a first novel , we must assume that so fine a talent as Mr. Guthrie 's would be evident somewhere in the book if something were riot concealing it . Except for his admirable economy of prose , the book might have been written by any of three dozen fabricators of Westerns . Mr. Fergusson 's novels pretty well cover the history of the West from the fur trade on . So he sometimes has a cowboy or a herd of steers or the open range , but only as part of the stream of time . They are simply there , just as cottonwoods grow along the creeks . Mr. Fergusson does nothing with them ; he is interested in people and experiences far removed from them . in Mr. Davis 's novels there are some working cowboys and some elders whose reminiscences include the stock business , but they are on the periphery and do not embody a single sentiment of horse opera . I can not remember any cowpokes in Mr. Corle 's novels . If these five men are the best contemporary novelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it is significant that they have not tried to work with the material from which our annual production of horse opera ? which ran to 141 original novels in 1953 ? is fabricated . They must have considered working with that material . So they may have concluded that by now it is not possible to write first-rate novels about the Cattle Kingdom , the traditions that stem from it . or the values horse opera attributes to it . They may have decided that the sentiments and conventions have piled up so high that the subject can not be brought to life in fiction . I do not say that it can not be , but only that it has n't been . Mr. Conrad Richter 's The Sea of Grass is the most interesting exhibit . Literary paleontologists of a later time will be able to restore the sentiments and values of the genre from the first chapter of this novel or even from the first sentence , which reads , " That lusty pioneer blood is tamed now , broken and gelded like the wild horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clich ? s of action but his situation and his characters are from stock and the sentiments he holds about them are the falsely heroic ones that compose the romantic legend of the Old West . The book is exquisitely written and it is the most professional job ever done in horse opera , but its illusion fails and a reader can not take it to heart . Mr. Richter is an artist , a lover of primitive America , and a man convinced that the promise of American life flickered out when that lusty pioneer blood was tamed . So it must be significant that he abandoned the open range and the Old West and turned to other frontiers to write the novels for which he will be remembered . Equally significant are a half-dozen skillful writers who in the last few years have been trying to make the material of horse opera produce fiction that is not horse opera . All it has produced for them is more pretentious horse opera . Why ? 1 no not need to observe that all the emotions of men are present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon or Gopher Prairie . The Cattle Kingdom provides plenty of spectacle and all the basic experiences out of which good fiction about other frontiers has been made . But no one has brought it or its cowboys to life , and the novels in which they appear do not impose themselves on a reader 's belieL It is a stylized form of romantic fiction . It is conventionalized , formularized , and even ritualized . It is peopled by figures who do not become characters because they feel nothing that can rouse a responsive feeling in the reader . At its best it is expert narrative . But at its best it remains lifeless , implausible , and in fact essentially absurd . Emotionally and intellectually it is as na ? ve as fiction can be . What we get instead of proper novels is an oxidized species of sun-god legend . It is usually set in the past , from the beginning of the Long Trail to the big freeze that finished off the Cattle Kingdom . When it is set in a later decade and when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliches in more recent costumes . Its commonest situation is the range war . The big rancher is trying to get the range away from the little ranchers , or the stockmen are trying to keep the range from the sod-busters , the homesteaders . ( History has a third kind of range war but we do n't get it here , for the cowboy is a caballero and clubbing sheep to death by the thousand simply is not heroic . ) The sun god may be lined up on either side . He may be a strong man of lusty pioneer blood , an aristocrat , and a lover of the free way of life who is trying to preserve our golden age ; or he may be a champion of the underdog and of progress and the future . If he is a sodbuster , however , he was once a caballero and is now trying to bring law to the frontier in place of gunsmoke . A switch can be worked by putting both female leads , instead of one , on the other side . Or he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though again he must formerly have been a cowpoke ? and there is a switch here too , for he can be on either side or in transition from one to the other . Whatever he is , he is a sun god , The Hero . A PART from the range war , the commonest themes are vengeance and the heart of the gunman . Honor requires The Hero to avenge some injury or humiliation , or the murder of a relative or apardner , or the piracy of his ranch , or the false testimony that got him jailed . Or he is a range detective and as such can be worked into any of the variations I have listed . ( Torn Horn has fathered a regiment of sun gods , though in Mr. MacKinlay Kantor 's surprising excursion into horse opera he remains simply and repulsively Tom Horn . ) Or he is a gun for hire . In this plot he is not seen forthrightly as the badman of the movies ; he is a veteran of the Lincoln County War or the Johnson County War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowed " rider down tragic trails . He is imported by the big-shots to kill off the small opposition but he changes sides . Or he has abandoned his profession in order to live peacefully but resumes it so that he can champion one or the other side on behalf of justice , honor , sound family life , or true as opposed to fleshly love . Whatever the theme and situation , The Hero progresses through a series of ritualistic fist fights ( Hollywood 's sole contribution to the form ) and ritualistic betrayals to a ritualistic finale composed of serial murder or general massacre . He also progresses to true love , though occasionally one of the variations may require him to renounce it . Mr. Hutchinson says that the second period of horse opera opened with Zane Grey 's Riders of the Purple Sage , which ends with a recognition that the sun god and the girl are going to live together but will never meet a 14 parson . He dates the present period from an innovation by Ernest Hay-cox that has become standard . Two loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can be awakened , and the loyal , generous , obviously passionate girl whose appeal to The Hero 's hormones must lose out because her past is shadowed . Prose as well as action is ritualized . hi the average horse opera the stereotypes are merely those of dull and clumsy writing . The handful of expert writers I am interested in here are pedantic in their insistence on a vocabulary supposed to be that of the Cattle Kingdom and they tend to run off into mighty tony elegance . A character does not squat ; he hunkers or hunkers down . A cigarette is best called a quirly ; it is seldom rolled or made , it is fashioned , shaped , spun , or built ; it is not lit , fire is put to it . A cook may be a coosie ; biarikets are soogans or sougans ; a saddle is a kak . One does not mount a horse or get into the saddle , he steps up to leather . Instead of spurring his horse , he touches or feeds steel to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse opera and came closer than anyone else to making good novels of it , left his mark ? I should say his brand ? on the style as well as the content . He learned his trade in the Saturday Evening Post at a time when some excellent writers contributed to it regularly , and he studied them with care . From Joseph Hergeshcimer , Thomas Beer , and certain others he picked up useful narrative devices , tricks of rendering light and scenery , and cursive symbols of characters . He bequeathed these to his heirs , together with a couple of Hergesheimer 's less fortunate mannerisms . Like Hergesheimer , one does not say that a man felt sad but that " he knew sadness " or that a woman was charming but that " she owned charm . " The form has always run to stylistic formulas . One of the longest-lived was invented by Bret Harte twenty-five years before the first horse opera . The plain language of Truthful James , which swept the English-speaking world in 1870 , begins , " Which I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first stanza ends , " Which the same I would rise to explain , " and another one begins , " Which we had a small game . " In the late 1890s Alfred Henry Lewis adopted the locution . " Which I 'm sashayin ' was sashayin ' down the road , " his Old Cattleman says , or , " Which you-all shorely gets a hand , " or , " Which I yereafter backs will back this infant 's play myse'f . " He fastened that " which , " together with the present-tense narrative , on a large part of cowboy fiction for nearly fifty years . N OTE too that Lewis 's Wolfville stories were humorous . The cowboy story was established as a romantic saga of The Hero at the very beginning , with The Virginian . But Wister abundantly sprinkled his work with humor and for a long time the form was regarded as primarily humorous ; it was turned into the path that has led to its present solemnity by its one novelist , Rhodes , and by the fabulists Harold Bell Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still good reading , Henry Wallace Phillips ' Red Saunders stories , for instance . In the hands of 0 . Henry humor became travesty and burlesque which were sometimes pretty good , and this strain gets its best expression in Harry Leon Wilson 's Ma Pettingill stories . Wilson is hugely amusing and an excellent writer ; his cowboy stories have some of the sharply satirical edge he gave his other novels but he did not try to get rid of the cliches . ( George Horace Lorimer once informed me that he was a much more important writer than Mark Twain , and advised one to drop Mark and write a hook about Wilson . ) But nowadays horse opera is much too serious to tolerate humor , which has retreated to the pulps , where it is fearfully bad . Ernest Haycox played an important part in this solemnification . It was he who added the Hamlet strain to the sun god that is now standard . The Hero is always a shadowed man and a regretful fatalist . He is born to ride dim and lonely trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything breaks , everything vanishes , and ah ! how stale , fiat , and unprofitable is this sterile promontory . The heart of man is lonely too and sadness as well as the sound of gunfire ride the wind at dawn , and woman 's love is not for The Hero , nor a cook stove in the kitchen of his own shanty . It turns out , of course , that the end he rides toward is a multiple murder , from which he takes three steps into the arms of the rounded girl whose sleeping fire his six-gun has awakened , all the more so if he himself has been wounded in the shoulder or the upper chest . At first , I think , Haycox wanted only to write horse opera as expertly as he could learn how to . But he was a talented man and he developed an ambition to present the Western past as it truly was . But the sentiments of horse opera and the fantasy of the Old West , which in part they came from and in part created , proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range-riders to life . He turned to other parts of Western history , the emigrant trains , the mining camps , the Columbia River steamboats , the Indian wars . He did much better with them and two or three times he came close to breaking through mythology and writing fiction . Bugles in the Afternoon , which incidentally to its purpose is a sound history of the Little Bighorn campaign , is almost a good novel , and a number of his short stories are the real thing . But the fantasy and sentiments of the Old - West. won out ; he could not get free of them ; always he ended where he had begun , inside horse opera . A couple of essays he wrote late in life have a bitterness that may be an oblique self-criticism , and I can understand his last novel , The Earthbreakers , only as an angry comment on The Way West . It seems to have been intended to show Mr. Guthrie what an unworthy thing he had done ? unworthy of the myth of the Old West . D ETAIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambitious writers I have mentioned , who have been trying to make good fiction out of horse opera . They are all trying to be Haycox and to go beyond him , though no one as good at the job as he has yet appeared . They all repeat his experience and fall short of their goal in the same ways and for the same reasons . Theywrite the most skillful and most readable horse operas . They are scrupulous antiquarians ; you do not find in their books either the anachronisms or the greenhorn blunders about cattle ranching that are common farther down the scale . They are better with the mines or the Indians or the U. S. Army in the West than they are on the range , but wherever they are , they remain inclosed in conventions , fantasy , sentiments , and myths that frustrate their intent and falsify their books . The Old West refuses to live for them . Not only do their books fail to make a reader believe and feel ; they remain essentially preposterous . How could it be otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West they deal with has existed only in myth and realistic fiction can not be made out of it . The most talked-about of recent Westerns , though in my opinion not the best one , is Mr. Jack Schaefer 's Shane . Its central character is The Hero 200-proof ; he establishes all over again that even a bush-league sun god is non-human . The gods do not feel the emotions of mankind , and the glory , grandeur , and nobility of the Old West myth can not be translated into acceptable human motives . HE novelist can have the Old I West myth or the historical West but I judge he ca n't have both of them at the same time . The actual prototype of the gun for hire was a repulsive psychopath like anyone who carried a submachine gun for Al Capone . Like Gyp the Blood or Pretty Boy Floyd . The mass murder that clears the range or cleans up the town at the end of the story is just the St. Valentine 's Day massacre in batwing chaps . The odd effort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gunfire momentarily acceptable as fast action , which the less ambitious Western does . It is to persuade us that we have witnessed some high human drama of aspiration and regeneration and atonement , and that the most admirable of human motives went into it , plus enough pure love to heal the wounds . It ca n't be done . Horse opera is kidding itself , and while it continues to nobody will take it seriously .
