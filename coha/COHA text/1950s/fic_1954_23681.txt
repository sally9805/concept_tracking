The Operator A Story by Elizabeth Enright Drawings by Arthur Marokvia T - 1E strange things you want in this life ! . . . When I was nine or ten years old I wanted a middy blouse more than anything on earth . I wanted it so badly that I dreamed about it ; whined through my nose for it . But my mother shook all her blond curls in a sort of vivacious horror : " No , honey ! Never ! Heavens , shades of Radcliffe girls with chafing dishes and bulging calves all leaping at a basketball together and having a corking time . Corking ! That 's the sort of word that goes with middy blouses . No , Baby . Over my dead body . . . " And since my mother was the one sun in my sky ( my father had been killed in Belleau Wood ) I resigned myself to the quaint little smocked dresses that she chose for me . I did not realize at the time that the way I was dressed bore a relationship to two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face , but I tolerated them with the enforced philosophy of childhood , sensing that the day would surely come when I could change all three . Only now , in looking at old photographs can I see that there was justice in the nickname at least : that I was called " Granny " not only because my own true name was Grania . The face that I examine as I might a stranger 's seems to predict a weight of age on its small features , and nothing was done to lessen the effect by the way I wore my hair , earnestly strained back from my forehead with a round comb . I think that my mother unconsciously emphasized the precocious elderly quality of my looks because she was Adair Lovett , the actress , and so young , so young to Look at for so long , that the contrast between us must have had a certain humorous originality and she , naturally , was conditioned to audiences . At the time I speak of , 1920 or thereabouts , Mary Pickford wilderness-curls were still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair in this fashion . I used to love to watch her brushing it , and then dipping her comb into the teacup of warm water and curling the tip-ends around her finger till they strutted on her shoulders like little pantalctte legs . I was spellbound by all her formidable technique of enhancement , and asked nothing better than to he allowed to watch in the theater dressing-room as she put on her makeup : a long , grave ritual starting with her flawless naked face and ending up with the mask of a candy doll . " Oh , Mama , you look so pretty ! " " Do I , Baby ? Well I have to look pretty , after all . It 's what pays the darn bills , is n't it ? And buys your roller skates and Tootsie Rolls . Now run on home , honey ; get to bed . Take her , Mademoiselle . " Her cheek would touch mine , smelling strong of make-up and delicious , like a whole barber shop , and she was gone . Hissing and resisting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would stand at the door of the dressing-room , listening to the last bars of the overture ; then a great heartbeat interval of silence . . . and all at once a sound as though a door had opened onto the world ! It was applause , but at this distance it seemed like a wind from the desert or the sea , huge and thrilling . Then silence again and a tiny voice began to speak , my mother 's voice . All the winds and waves were still , and I was proud and jealous and exalted . " Now , Granny , you come ! " Mademoiselle would bang my blue beaver hat , also quaint , onto my head , and there was nothing for it but to return to the unreal , unlovable world of reality . So it came as a bolt from the blue when one day Mademoiselle told my mother that she was leaving immediately to get married . Mademoiselle , that bundle of Gallic twigs ! No one had ever considered such a possibility . " Now what on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother crossly . " Who 's going to stay with you at night ? " " Mama , I do n't need anybody any more . " " Granny baby , do n't be so silly . You know I can never get home before eleven-thirty . " " Well , Lutie 's here till seven ; no , now , Mama , wait ! Listen . If I get lonesome or anything I can talk to the switchboard lady . She 's a very nice lady and she 's right down-stairs . " " And she does n't go home till twelve , " mused my mother . " Oh , no , honey , I do n't think so . . . . " But I saw that I would soon win my point . A 1 THAT time we were living in a second- floor apartment in West 10th Street . The lobby was an asset to the tenants : large , faintly grand , a polished place that smelled strongly of Liquid Veneer and dimly of cats . It was illuminated by paired bracket-lamps , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their Tiffany glass shades reminded me of half-sucked candy . Two staircases  --  one for the tenants on the east side of the building and one for the tenants on the west  --  opened out and upward with expansive , old-fashioned gestures ; and in each French window stood a twirled iron tripod holding a pot of those plants which somehow cling to life through all : spitting radiators , north light , neglect of janitors . For me the lobby had a soothing elegance ; it brought to mind the baronial halls in illustrations by Reginald Birch . I did not see the cracks or feel the drafts . There must have been drafts , for the switchboard stood sheltered in a grotto of burlap screens , and whatever operator worked there wore a sweater on her shoulders . There , night after night , she sat , in a puddle of Rembrandt light , ministering to the irascible instrument in her charge , and there beside her , perhaps to her secret desperation , I sat , too . A T FIRST there was Miss Delevant , a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bangles and Venetian beads , and rattled when she moved even slightly , like a horse in its harness . Indignation was her preferred climate . " Well , I 'm very sorry , but I distinctly understood you to say Stuyvesant , " she would tell the mouthpiece . " He did , too , Stuyvesant ! " she would hiss at me , - her face deeply impressed with outrage . When a caller came to see one of the tenants she would look at him narrowly . " Are you expected ? " And somewhere , remotely , there was an implication that she did not believe this possible . " Name , please , " was the next question if he was hot expected , and then the name was appraised silently and repeated as if a little soiled , into the mouthpiece . " A Mr. Crouch to see you , " she would announce daintily , while Mr. Crouch stood listening to his name recede , flapping his derby nervously against his thigh , until told he might go up . " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his footsteps rang out lonely on the stair-treads she would look at me and wink , for I , it seemed , was her one ally . " Crouch , " she would repeat , and we would laugh maliciously . Undoubtedly the poor man could hear us on his way up , and this , I understood tacitly , was part of the plan . The janitress in those days was a Scandinavian woman named Helga who flapped up and down the basement stairs in dun-colored garments and gray Comfy slippers . Her pale green hair was stuck to her head with big steel pins like croquet wickets that were always falling out onto the floor with a clang . She loved to laugh , and laughed often . Her little eyes would close up , watering , and her wide-open mouth turned down at the corners in a pain of mirth . She and Miss Delevant hated each other . " Aw , she do n't got no red blut , that old mait , she only got winegar in her weins , " Helga said ; and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a person to keep themselves clean and dainty . I just do n't understand disorder . " Helga , perhaps , was instrumental in getting Miss Delevant dismissed ; for one night when I came downstairs I found that there was a new operator , a fat young man named Nigel Eliscue , who talked as though his mouth were full of cake . He was a ballet enthusiast , and we spent many happy evenings discussing Pavlova , of whom I owned thirty-seven pl graphs , and who I planned to be when I grew up . It was Nigel who , for my benefit , attempted entrechat.s that made the lampshades tingle and brought Helga up from her cozy realm of cats and coffee . " Cut it out , fella , the plaster 's busting down . " Nigel lasted two weeks , and after him came old Mrs. Pohd who handled the switchboard as if it were a loom to weave veils on . And then , after Mrs. Pohd , came Gerald . T CAN NOT remember his last name though 1 havem the tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He it : from was young , but younger , and in a different way , than Nigel Eliscue . I do not think that he was more than twenty-two ; a handsome boy with dark crisp hair and clear-cut feat ures . To each of the switchboard operators my mother had given certain directions , disguised as gentle requests , and now she them to Gerald , possibly with some giving . " Would you mind if my little girl sits with you a while after the maid goes home ? Oh , that 's awfully sweet of you , it keeps her from being lonesome . But promise me , wo n't you , not to let her be a bother , and promise Me , please , that you 'll send her up at nine o'clock ! " " 1 certainly will , Miss Lovett , you can count on me , " said Gerald , standing up and staring radiantly at my mother . ( He wantedto be an actor , he told me later ; was theater mad . " But meantime I have to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned this stuff . . . just filling in , honey , just filling in . " ) All the other operators had kept these promises faithfully ; I never could wheedle more than fifteen extra minutes out of any of them , but Gerald was another story ; sometimes he let . me stay in the lobby till after eleven . Then he would glance at the prissy little clock in its case on top of the switchboard . " You better vamoose , Cinderella . do n't leave any glass footgear on the either , or I 'll be in Dutch . " " All right , I wo n't . Good night , Gerald ! " Upstairs in my bed I would fall into sleep as a stone falls into a well , and often I dreamed of my new friend . Each evening when Lutie , the maid , was gone I came down the broad east staircase . Halfway down I would pause and lean on the balustrade , staring down at Gerald in his grotto . If he was not busy he would look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's that ? " I asked suspiciously , the first evening . " A girl with long hair like yours that looked down from a balcony . " " I thought that was what's-her-name ; you know . Juliette . " " She did , too . Girls are always leaning over balconies and switching their hair around , but I never cared for Juliet . " " I did n't either . Too fat . " " She was ? " " In the opera of her that I " Fat , huh ? Maybe that 's appealed to me . Well , come into my parlor. " 1 GIGGLED , went down , and took my place in the little rocker where I had already spent so many evenings . The switchboard lights were very becoming to him ; so were the earphones on his head . He looked like Satan as a youth , before his evil had become serious . His hands moved dextrously among the tubes and plugs ; I noticed that his fingers were extremely long and supple , with tips that turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . He spoke to the switchboard as if it were alive : " Quiet now , kid , take it easy , do n't get hysterical , " or : " Try it in high C , Amelita . " Nearly every night he told me a chapter of his life 's history : not his true life history  --  of that I seldom heard a word  --  but an imaginary one . " Did I ever tell you about the time I was practicing veterinary surgery in Bessarabia ? No ? Honest ? Well , it 's kind of interesting . The Great Ampere 's favorite horse was sick , see . It had horse hives . You 've never heard of horse hives ? They 're fierce . They come up all over in ranges like the Appalachians and the horse is in agony ; you ca n't really scratch with a hoof . So ... " - Naturally he had cured the horse  --  by giving it injections of turpitude , I think  --  and had been rewarded handsomely . " You know what he did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and ninety-six wives . But to tell you the truth I was n't too pleased : the youngest one was forty , and all their teeth had been filled with emeralds ; when they smiled it was like a lot of Lenox Avenue locals were coming at you . But nobody can refuse a present from the Great Ampere , of course . So I brought them all back with me and turned them over to Cartier 's . Got a very nice price for them , too . " " Oh , Gerald , you 're so crazy , " I protested admiringly . It never mattered to me that his stories were told as if someone else , someone more important , were listening . . My mother , at times , gave me the same feeling . Another of his lives had been spent as organist of the great cathedral of Our Lady of Chevrolet . " See , this is how it goes , " he said , demonstrating on the switchboard . " Say you 're playing the Fugue by Jules Bache , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( judge Howley 's line ) ? and this one here 's the Vox Angelica ( Mrs. Dunphy 's . Can you beat it ! ) ? and this one is the Vox Populi . . . . Now , see you pull this stop out ( they 're called stops ) ? and push this one in ( Oh , sorry Mrs. Dunphy , my mistake ) ? all the time working the pedals , and pretty soon the music begins to build up and get strength , and the organ pipes are standing up there like the Ku Klux Klan , all gold and all roaring , and after a while the whole doggone church starts to rattle ... and you feel as if you 're making so much racket that you 're drowning out the noise of everything that could ever scare you or hurt you in the world . As if you were murdering those things ! " . A quality in the way he spoke made me feel that at that moment we were in shoal water , somewhere just above the truth . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Gerald ? " I said . " Honestly , now , cross your heart , have n't you ? " " So it 's facts we 're after now , is it ? Everyone 's always nosing after facts , and they are n't anything . Sure , I have . But it was a one-horse organ in a one-horse church in a one-horse town ; and it was the old kind that has to have the air pumped into it by hand ; a thing like a pair of bellows . A fat kid used to do it for me , and every now and then he 'd get lazy or forget and then the organ would kind of die out loud , w-a-a-a-h , like a mule . . So one day , though , who should come to town but Geraldine Farrar . . you know who she is. do n't you ? " " I know her . Once I sat on her lap . " I had to tell him all about it before he would go on . This was the currency with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounters with the great . " And what 's more , Mama has her signed picture right on her bedroom wall ! " " Some day I 'm going to sneak some time away from this Medusa and come up and see all these pictures . " " Yes , but now go on , Gerald . " " Well , it seems Geraldine is in desperate need of an accompanist ( the old one died ) ? and not only an accompanist , but an instrument to sing to . The Steinway at Weaver Brothers Auditorium has had an acute attack of mice in its felts . . , . By this turn of events I could see that he had safely steered his craft away from the reef and I was contented that this should be so . Gerald was my first experience of that person who seduces by withholding , whose whole personality , while trimmed with lures of wit and physical beauty , is always kept at a distance . Because of my age I not only accepted but enjoyed this , wishing nothing more ; had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who would inevitably break their ties with him by their need to draw close ; who by loving the spell would break the spell . It did not trouble me that I knew almost nothing about his true life ; that he never mentioned his family or any friend . He had told me that he eked out his income by ushering at a concert hall in the afternoons , but that was all I knew about his life . It was enough for me that lie was there , made me laugh , and kept me company ; and that he never called me Granny , but wonderful names like Esmeralda , and Melisande . The other tenants liked him too , and often stopped to chat on the way in or out . Even Judge Howley , an old throat-clearing , slowly petrifying magistrate , would pause and makestatuesque utterances , and Miss Geary from the third floor would shift her bundles , or set them down , and give way to conversation as swimmers give way to a strong current . In Miss Geary 's case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to our apartment , and take down the telephone receiver . " Get me Syracuse , " I would then direct , trying not to laugh . " Syracuse ? Yes sir , right away . " Gerald 's voice sounded very businesslike , and in another moment I could hear Miss Geary creaking her big soft self up the stairs to the floor above , and soon , drunk with conspiracy , I would tiptoe down again . Helga adored Gerald and often brought him snacks , coffee and damp fungoid crullers , which he shared with me , and her soiled , scarred cats crept up the stairs to fawn and gargle against his legs . My mother who had at first taken a wary view of our relationship now reassured herself as she reassured her friends , on the telephone : " Oh , Granny adores him ; he 's such a lovable boy . And responsible . Is n't he , baby ? " she would ask , turning to me , and warmly I added my share to her confidence . Y MARKS at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time my report card came home with nothing but A 's on it my mother took me to Schrafft 's for a chocolate Luxuro Sundae . She did not know and I did not tell her that Gerald had been " helping " me with my homework . " Why strain yourself ? " he said magnanimously . " I 've been through all this stuff in my time , someone might as well profit by it . You have to help some , though , or they 'll smell a rat . Come on , now , define a participle . " He exacted a certain amount of co-operation from me , and saw to it that I copied , in my own handwriting , the themes he wrote for me . My English teacher began to single inc out for praise . Gerald always brought a book with him ; for a long time it was Jean Cristophe , I remember , and as I scratched away with my chewed cedar pencil he would read on , doggedly . From time to time our studies were interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switchboard ; by the plate-glass shudder of the vestibule door as the tenants came home , bringing with them a whiff of cold street air . Between these minor events our silence was peaceful : the little clock hurried along its narrow path , the cooling radiator knocked with a metal knuckle . often went out in the with an opera hat and a brocaded coat . " Good evening , Gerald ; good evening , dear . " Mrs. Decatur 's silver slippers blinked across the parquet , and Mr. Decatur stalked at her side with the gait of a Caspian crane . For a few minutes after they had left the whole lobby smelled of Quelques Fleurs . One night in May they gave a party . " Killing all their birds with one stone , " Gerald surmised , and we gaped with pleasure , as first the caterers and musicians , and then the guests , arrived . Often there were parties in the building , but this was in a different class . " They got the rugs rout up , " Helga said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From nine o'clock on , the bell kept ringing and I opened the front door to admit the guests . I soared on a wave of narcissistic pleasure the whole evening . All the men and the fragrant ladies smiled at me , and my greedy ego feasted on praise overheard . " What a charming child ! " " So quaint . . . . " It was a warm night . The Decaturs ' door was left ajar releasing sounds of gabble and music and popping corks . At half-past-ten Mrs. Decatur came into the lobby wearing a dress of rose-colored tulle arid walking rather carefully . In one hand she carried a lily-stemmed glass and in the other a plate of petit fours . " Here , children , here 's a little party for you , too . Such good quiet little mice . . . . The champagne 's for you , Gerald . Do n't you go arid report its to the mean old blue-noses ! " " Silent unto death ! " vowed Gerald , standing up and bowing . Mrs. Decatur blew us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like cider , " Gerald said , and drank his wine at a gulp , as if he were thirsty . I concentrated on the little cakes , and when Helga came up , sloppy and agog , we gave her some , too . " It 's a real Affair , " she said admiringly . " The cars they got , some of them people ; and shofers ! And listen to that band ! " The orchestra was playing the waltz from Sari , and suddenly Gerald leaped to his feet and grabbed Helga around the waist . " Come on , Leonora Hughes , let 's show them ! " He swept her into his arms and loped gracefully about the lobby carting her with him like a bundle of wash , as her Comfy slippers skidded and the hairpins rang . I jumped up and down in an ecstasy of mirth , stuffing my hair into my mouth , as though laughter must always be kept confined . The switchboard , luxuriously abandoned , buzzed and glared and all the lamp shades jingled . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate it was that the landlord , Mr. Brainard , should have been invited to the party ; that he should have let himself in at the front door just as Gerald had lifted Helga up in his arms and was doing a series of dervish turns to the accompaniment of her maniac shrieks . How unfortunate it was that at the instant of his entrance one of her gray ghastly slippers , the color and texture of lint under a bed , should have flown from her foot in a graceless arc to strike his starched white shirt front . " Gerald ! ! " " Oh , my God , " said Helga . Gerald set her down , and still unsteady from the turns , they faced him . " Finish your week out and that 's the end , " Mr. Brainard said in a still , furious voice . " Now get the hell over to that switchboard . " " Aw , he yust a kid , " protested Helga . " He yust play , like . . . " " You , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . You and your cats . I relied on you . " Helga gave him a slow northern look , and lifted one shoulder in a shrug . " Ishkabibble . Let somebody else grow mushrooms in your damn cellar , " she said ; then she retrieved her slipper , took her time about adjusting it to her candid bunioned foot , and left the lobby at a comfortable pace . Mr. Brainard turned his attention to me : " And you , Grania  --  that 's your name , is n't it ? What 're you doing down here ? What 's the matter with your mother , letting you stay up all night like this ? With a grown-up man , like this ? " I felt cold , suddenly , and dirty . I wanted to defend my mother , but at the same time I was conscious of a puzzling , treasonous anger toward her , too . I said nothing , and stared at Mr. Brainard 's evening shoes which after a moment walked away and in at the Decaturs ' door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's horrid and I hate him ! " " Me , too , the dirty bastard , but never you mind . Look , you better go up . I 'll come with you , shall T ? it 'll he my last chance to see those photographs . " " All right . " The north wall of my mother 's room was covered with pictures of her theater friends , all signed with names and endearments in bold handwriting planned for the public eye . " Sa-a-y , she 's really got the whole stable , has n't she ? Mrs. Fiske ! . . . Gee , and Elsie Janis . Who 's this  --  Oh , William Faversham . . But where 's the photo of her best beau ? " " What beau ? She 's got millions of them but she has n't any best one . " " Sure she has . I mean the one that brings her home every night . A big man ; good-looking- . With a mustache . I see them.out in the vestibule talking and talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , well , it 's probably nobody . . . Look at John Drew . He 's got a profile like a codfish . " But soon Gerald 's attention seemed to flag . He wandered aimlessly around the room . " I lost my ushering job last week , too , " he said . " Oh , no ! " " Yep . It ended in a mess , too . It always ends in a mess . Now this one has . And I tried . This time I honest to God tried , and still it ends in a mess . The hell with trying . " " Gerald , I ca n't stand it that you wo n't be here any more . " " Where will I be , I wonder ? I have n't got a bean . " As I myself had not a bean there was nothing 1 could do to help him . But his mood changed suddenly and he smiled . " Forget it kid . I just blew off some steam . . . . Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on him ? " I turned to look . " Oh , that 's my father . " " Nice . That 's a good portrait job , too . Who  --  did it ? " I leaned toward the picture . " Somebody spelled S-T-E-I-C-H-F-N . I do n't know how you say it . " My father had been a handsome man I could see , now that time had removed him from me . He wore his lieutenant 's cap at an angle . His mouth smiled . But suddenly my eye was diverted from the face in the photograph to that which was moving on its surface ; I could see Gerald behind me , clearly reflected in the glass , and what was he doing so quietly and quickly ? lie had half turned away , and with those supple fingers of his was scooping something into his pocket from the dressing table . My memory related to inc the fact that there under the light I had just seen my mother 's emerald ring and her pearl necklace . Frozen , I stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not turn , . and the whole incident took no more than a second . ERALD came and stood beside me . He put his hand on my shoulder , turning me toward him gently , but my shoulder knew how to slide out from under . Then he picked up a lock of my long hair and twirled it idly in his fingers . I stood patiently tethered , waiting to be released . Above his collar I could see a little pulse , a little pump in the blood , ticking steadily . " I guess I wo n't see you again , Mel isande . " I said nothing , waiting . " Miss me ? " " Gerald , listen to the switchboard ! You better go ! " " Oh , let it choke itself to death . " " But Mr. Brainard 's down there . " " Well , all he can do is fire me and he 's fired me . If he thinks I 'm going to finish out the week . he 's crazy . " Remembering his voice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and rather nasal . Was it perhaps a touch effeminate ? How strange that memory can store impressions until , years later , one is ready to appraise them . And then , of course , there is the'possibilitv that the impressions ' are not valid ; that the emotions have discolored them , for vengeance .. . " Maybe I had better get out of here , " Gerald said . " Can I give you a kiss good-by ? " " I guess so . " Cool lips touched my cheek . " So long , Melisande . " " So long . " He hesitated , with a flicker of concern . " You 're tired . Go to bed now , wo n't you , like a good kid ? " " All right . " When he had left I stood where 1 was , and soon I began to shiver . If I lifted the receiver of the telephone whose voice would answer me but his ? After a while I got into my nightgown but I did not go to bed . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . From the Decaturs ' apartment just below came shreds of music and a sprawled sound of laughing . At last , with terrible relief , I heard the quake of glass in the front door 's closing , and in a moment not one , but two pairs of footsteps on the stairs ; two pairs on the bare hall floor outside . Then my mother 's voice . " But he 's never left the switchboard before twelve ? " " Oh , sweetheart , it 's all right . You 'll see . " This voice , a man 's , I had not heard before . " Leaving her all alone with a boy like that , I never did feel ? " The key that had been rattling in the lock performed its task ; the door swung open . Beside my mother , holding her against him with his arm , was a tall man with a dark mustache . " Granny ! What ! What 's wrong , why are you still up ? " Terrified , my mother ran to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noise , " I said . " Where , honey ? Where ? " " I think ... on the fire escape . " " Ken , go see ! Off the bedroom  --  back there .

Mr. Kenneth Purdue ; he 's an awfully nice man , Granny , you 're going to just love him . . . Are you sure you 're all right , honey ? " " Yes . " The man came back again . He smiled at me . " Nothing there now , anyway . Maybe it was a cat , Granny . Maybe it was a dream , h-m ? . . . I 'm glad to meet you , little girl . We 're going to be great pals , did you know that ? " " All right , " I said . When I went to bed the sheets were cold ; the shivering came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear two voices but no words , and from far away the Decaturs ' sickening music . All men were thieves . 1 ATER , when they asked me questions , I lied and said that Gerald had never I been in our apartment . I repeated my story about a noise on the fire escape ; and the guilt of my knowledge lodged under my ribs in an undigested lump . But in the end the summer - came , the show closed , and we went to the seashore . In the fall when my mother married again , I was sent to a school in the country , and after a while I was happy enough to be able to ten them the truth ; and they were happy enough to be able to leave it alone . The apartment house still stands in 10th Street . Now and then I pass it and glance into the lobby I once knew so well . Unlike most childhood scenes viewed in maturity it has hardly shrunk at all . But there are changes . The switchboard vanished years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bronze breasts and navel to the drafts . The Tiffany glass lampshades have been replaced with plastic ones , and the plants are gone ; yet the place retains its luster and decrepit style . Probably it still smells of polish ; perhaps of cats . But I am never tempted to investigate .
