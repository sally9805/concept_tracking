While the public wondered how long it would be before it actually gets color TV , the industry went on with its brisk little backstage civil war . Last week the uproar over the Federal Communications Commission decision approving CBS 's field sequential system of color television ( TIME , Oct. 23 ) grew louder . Items : <P> Big RCA and little Pilot Radio Corp . filed suits asking that the FCC order be set aside as " contrary to the public interest . " Pilot soon dropped its complaint , to make way for a clear-cut battle between RCA-NBC and the FCC . <P> The FCC warned that it would " vigorously oppose . . . any injunctive relief to . . . RCA-NBC , " canceled NBC 's authorization to continue experimental compatible color telecasts during regular broadcasting hours . <P> Defending FCC , Chairman Edwin C. Johnson of the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee charged that RCA and its friendly setmakers were on a " sit down strike . " Said he : The FCC 's order " makes it possible for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so wrong about that ? " <P> The Radio-Television Manufacturers Association held a closed-door meeting at Manhattan 's Hotel Roosevelt , decided on a nationwide publicity campaign against CBS color . R.T.M.A. President Robert C. Sprague led off by advising the public that " if they are interested in good reception of the better television programs , they can buy black &; white sets now , with confidence that they will continue to receive these programs for many years to come . " <P> Four more manufacturers ( Belmont , Webster , Muntz and the Television Equipment Corp. ) broke ranks , joined Emerson , Celomat and Tele-tone in promising to make CBS color equipment . Tele-tone , with sets already in the works , said it would have quantity production by Jan. 1 . Crowed CBS President Frank Stanton in full-page newspaper ads : " CBS welcomes Tele-tone-the first set manufacturer to bring you color television . "
