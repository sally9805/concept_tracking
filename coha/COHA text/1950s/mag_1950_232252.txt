Looking like a morose but determined bantam rooster , small ( 5 ft. 2 in . ) Chess Grand Master Sam Reshevsky walked to the center of the crowded game room at Washington 's Jewish Community Center . He acknowledged the applause with a faint smile , then turned to face the 42 opponents who were waiting for him . It was exactly 8 p.m . By midnight he had beaten 32 of his brooding opponents , fought the rest to a clucking draw . <P> Such mass chess fights were an old story to taciturn , 38-year-old , Polish-born Sammy Reshevsky . When he was nine , and a newcomer to the U.S. , he had taken on the 20 best chessers at West Point simultaneously and beaten them all . He has competed for the U.S. championship six times since then , and won it each time . <P> Last week Sammy was taking on all comers . In the next six weeks , as Sammy made a coast-to-coast tour of 30-odd U.S. and Canadian cities , anyone with $2 and sufficient brass could have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy estimates that he trots 15 to 20 miles to make an average of 20 to 60 moves on each board . He likes to knock off 40 at a time , although recently at Germantown , Pa. he faced 75 in one evening . <P> If he makes enough on his tour , Sammy hopes to give up his job as a Manhattan accountant and become one of the first full-time U.S. chess pros . And he might decide to enter the U.S. biennial championship tournament this year , might even go to Russia , to challenge World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinnik . <P> Sammy has two children , 7 and 2 . They do n't play chess ; they like dolls and teddy bears .
