txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THENEW YORK TIMES : When the Cyprus question comes before the United Nations the people of Cyprus still hope that the United States Government will support them ; For their case is as just and right as the American case was in the eighteenth century , The aim of the Americans in their struggle against colonialism was to be allowed to express their wishes and decide their own future . The Cypriote cause is based upon the same principles . The British Government is laugh ? ing at the Cypriotes , saying that they are not really struggling for self-determination , and call them " terrorists , " a standard word in the vocabulary of colonialism . They said the same things about the Americans too . The General Evening Post of Nov. 29 , 1776 , in a leading article said : " We can scarce forbear to laugh at the public cry that the Americans are fighting for their liberty . " Hangings in Cyprus have been described by the British Government as essential . The execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middlesex Journal of Jan. 27 , 1774 , reports : " During the debate on the American Question , a noble Lord being asked what were the best measures to be adopted with Americans , laconically replied : Hang , draw- and . quarter fifty of them . " The British Government says today that the retention of Cyprus under Br dish rule is absolutely essential . ' sere is what they said in the case of America : " The subjugation of America is now an affair of necessity * * * . " ( The London Chronicle , July 13 , 1776 . ) They today accuse the Church a Cyprus of associating itself with the so-called " terrorists . " But what about the American Church : " We were lately favored with a copy of the pastoral letter sent front the Synod of New York to that of Virginia . * * * " We now see the old game played again , * * " ( Political Pamphlet , London .1777 . ) The Cypriote case is based upon the ideals of freedom and democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as necessary to remind the people and Government of the United States of the above . SPYROS A. KYPRIANOS , Representative of the Ethnarchy of Cyprus . New York , Nov. 9 , 1956 . Revision of Zoning Law To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read your editorial of Nov. relating to the City Planning Commission zoning amendment to Sec. 21-C with great interest , having followed this matter closely from its inception . The urgency for this amendment has not been made apparent any. , where . Large-scale developments have been built in this city without the benefit of such an amendment , and I am sure the ** Square development and the Chase Bank project are being designed in accordance with the present zoning regulations . The City of New York recently retained a firm of zoning specialists to revise the zoning law . It would seem to me that in view of the controversy raised by the proposed amendment the entire matter be tabled and referred to the experts for consideration . Such a procedure would give all interested parties an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission which initiated the proposal in the first instance . MAX SIEGEL . New York , Nov. 9 , 1956 . To Aid " Uneducable " Youth To TILE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Sol Markof , executive secretary , National Child Labor Committee , in his letter published Nov. 5 ignores completely the High School Teachers ' Association 's recommendation that " uneducables " be placed in surroundings where their problems could be handled efficiently . The H. S. T. A. does not recommend that the schools reject " uneducables . " On the contrary , it is urging labor to stop rejecting potential workers who might be of more service to society in business or industry than they are in school . High school teachers and principals are merely asking for cooperation from organized labor . That cooperation can take several forms : Give 15-year-old , " uneducables ' ' ' . a chance to prove that . they can contribute to industry and commerce by giving them special Attack on Hungary Failure of West to Take a Stand for Liberation Questioned The writer of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other books , " Theory and Practice in International Relations . " To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW YORK TIMES : If the Soviet Union can threaten the West with volunteers for Egypt why can not the West threaten the Soviet Union with Volunteers for Hungary ? If the Soviet Union can set up a puppet government in Hungary why can not the United Nations recognize the patriots as belligerents and their leaders as the Government of Hungary ? Why does the Secretary General of the United Nations consent to stand at the frontier pending permission to enter from a so-called Government with no claims to that name either in law or in fact ? Why does n't the U. N. send an ultimatum to the Soviet Union demanding evacuation of Hungarian territory within a week and an immediate cease-fire ? Why does n't the U. N. send a police force to Hungary ? Is it because the United States and Britain delivered Hungary to the Soviet Union at Yalta ? If so , has not the Soviet Union forfeited her claims under that ill-fated arrangement ? Or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If so , why should the Soviet Union be less afraid than we ? The Soviet Government can not trust its own infantry . Hence the surfeit of tanks and the lack of infantry in Hungary . Can the West survive the revelation that the only non-Hungarians to fight for Hungary 's freedom have been so far the Russian deserters ? Is the faith of the West in freedom so low that they do not see the hope of liberating the whole of eastern Europe and even Russia from communism if they make a stand now and prevent the murder of Hungary ?

ROY , Teachers Interest Committee , Chairman of High School Teachers ' Association . New York , Nov. 9 , 1956 . Cyprus ' Case Outlined Position . " Today Compared With That of American Colonies Consequences of Intervention To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It seems to me that at this stage there is one point which must be strongly underscored by us ? namely , the inevitable consequence of the intervention of the Soviet Army in Hungary . Indeed , whatever the regimes in the U. N. member countries , whether they are Communist-totalitarianas in the U. S. S. R. and our captive countries  --  or Fascist-totalitarian as , for instance , in Spain , dictatorial , as in the Dominican Republic , or Royalist-absolutist , as in Saudi Arabia , intervention by the army of a member state to unseat the government of another member state is an obvious act of aggression of one member of the U. N. against another . Unlike the action in the Middle Eastern crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . Furthermore , it is the first act of open and outright aggression since the Korean war . I submit , therefore , that the intervention of the Soviet Army in Hungary can not be condoned , and that if a new government is not set up now corresponding in the judgment of the United Nations General Assembly to the present conditions in Hungary and the will of the Hungarian people , this will mean the condoning of aggression by the United Nations . I believe that shrinking from this duty would bring about the end of the United Nations , as the aggression against Ethiopia spelled the end of the League of Nations and resulted afterward in the second World War . I am deeply convinced that ' the same causes of weakness would produce the same effects now . CHARLES A. DAVILA , Former Rumanian Minister to the United States . New York , Nov. 14 , 1956 . Appeal From Hungarian Writers To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The following appeal has been sent out from the Hungarian P. E. N. " Hungarian writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , We ask them to take the time and trouble so as to find the most effective means for giving help to the cause of liberty . Our fate is not only a political problem , it is a matter of life and death . " The American center of , the P. E. N. is in heartfelt sympathy with the brave people of Hungary , and we turn to you to ask for help in making the appeal of their writ ! ers heard . MARCHETTE CHUTE , President , The P.
