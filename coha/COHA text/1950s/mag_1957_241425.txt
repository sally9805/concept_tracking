For three weeks , French Biologists Jacques Benoit and Pierre Leroy have been brooding over a set of 26 ducklings with the impatience of a mother duck . For the ducklings contained the answer to a big question : Had the Benoit-Leroy team succeeded in producing a new breed of duck by chemical injection ? <P> The story began 13 months ago when Benoit and Leroy took twelve purebred Pekin ducklings and injected them with desoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) extracted from the genitals of Khaki-Campbell ducks . The amazing result was that , when the ducklings approached full growth , they had the Khaki-Campbells ' greenish-black bills and a set of snowy-white feathers quite unlike the Pekin 's normally coarse , creamy-colored plumage ( TIME , June 10 ) . The biologists named the new ducks Blanche-neige . <P> Was the change permanent ? The second generation might tell , and for that , Benoit and Leroy had to wait until new ducklings hatched from the eggs laid by their strange parents , and developed enough to display characteristic markings . Last week Benoit and Leroy reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eight had the cream-colored feathers and bright orange bills of ordinary Pekin ducks . But the other 18 were typical Blanche-neige . Apparently , the chemical injection had basically altered the parents ' genetic characteristics . <P> Benoit and Leroy made a reserved report to the French Academy of Sciences : " The percentage of change observed in 26 ducklings is sufficiently high to consider the differences recorded as significant . " Other scientists were not so calm . Said Robert Courrier , director of the Laboratory of Endocrinology of the Collge de France : " The work of Jacques Benoit and his collaborators is probably going to have extraordinary sequels . " Famed Biologist Jean Rostand declared himself " stupefied and overwhelmed . " Said he : " We are in the presence of a disturbing discovery ; Professor Benoit has succeeded in acting on the very mainsprings of life . . . transforming one race into another . It is a very great thing , which will open entirely new paths in a host of domains such as genetics and medicine . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
