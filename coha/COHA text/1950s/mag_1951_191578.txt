On his tenth visit to the Korean front , Douglas MacArthur summed up the military situation : " Our field strategy . . . a war of maneuver with the object of inflicting as heavy a punishment upon the enemy as possible ... has worked well . But we must not fall into the error of evaluating such . . . successes as decisively leading to the enemy 's defeat . " MacArthur added that the mountainous terrain , outnumbered U.N . forces , and political decisions over which he had no control made " purely academic " any talk of crossing the 38th parallel now . <P> Nevertheless , it was clear that Lieut . General Matthew Ridgway and his Eighth Army had the situation , such as it was , well in hand . Bolstered by an aggressive defense in depth , they had broken the powerful offensive of three Chinese Communist armies down the mountainous spine of central Korea . <P> The repulse , as MacArthur had warned , was not necessarily decisive . The well-trained Chinese Third Army , reported in the Wonsan area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Koreans . But by any reckoning , a big round had gone to the Eighth Army . A few miles of real estate had been traded for a great many Communist lives . <P> A British journalist just returned from Peking reported : " The war in Korea . . . is already somewhat of a surprise to the Chinese . " Hospitals in Manchuria , he added , could not take care of the great number of casualties . Mao Tse-tung and other Red Chinese strategists , who like to read the maxims of Sun-tzu , the ancient ( 500 B.C. ) Chinese Clausewitz , now found themselves up against a field strategy similar to the one that had helped bring down Europe 's great 19th Century aggressor . <P> The U.N . campaign in the Korean peninsula bore striking resemblance to the Duke of Wellington 's " Peninsular Campaign " against Napoleon 's armies in Spain . The Iron Duke , like Matthew Ridgway , was pitted against enemy armies of overwhelming numerical superiority , capable of getting steady overland reinforcements . Wellington 's troops , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington , describing his " war of maneuver " : " If they advance against me , I shall retire before them , accepting battle if they give me a favorable opportunity , for the missile action of my lines is superior to the shock action of their columns . . . " <P> The Peninsular Campaign was not decisive , but it destroyed several French armies , drained France of much of its trained manpower , softened Napoleon for ultimate defeat in mass land battles ( Leipzig and Waterloo ) nearer home . It was also no quick war . It took the Duke five years .
