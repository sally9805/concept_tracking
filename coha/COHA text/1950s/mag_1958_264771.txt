In three words President Eisenhower stretched the point about his Administration that had made it one of the cleanest in U.S. political history . He permitted an exception to his principle that any member of the White House staff involved in improper conduct in office , however minor , should be kicked out . He decided instead to stand behind a man-his able chief of staff Sherman Adams-on the arguable but shifting ground that the man at the heart of the White House staff system was not only a valued friend and loyal associate but was indispensable . The President 's three words : " I need him . " <P> The President thus took up a position that would not be easy to retreat from . The President himself , as congressional and press critics pointed out , would henceforth be involved in the building criticism of Sherman Adams ' imprudence . The President might even be involved , if only at third hand , in the still unfathomed life and times of Boston Operator Bernard Goldfine , the man that Sherman Adams vouches for . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched the point of principle to stand behind a man who had misstepped , but who was nonetheless deemed indispensable to the nation . He stood behind Lieut . General George Patton in 1943 after Patton slapped a serviceman in hospital in Sicily , a different situation as to public conduct-and as to war-but similar in that critics insisted that Patton must go . Eisenhower stood by Patton ; Patton rode on to glory ; Eisenhower 's wartime decision was justified . Now the measure of the size of Eisenhower 's decision to stand by Sherman Adams was that Sherman Adams , in order to extricate his chief from his bitter dilemma , would have to 1 ) turn in a Patton-size performance from here on out , 2 ) find a way to settle the enormous political liabilities , or 3 ) take the action that the President did not take and fire himself .
