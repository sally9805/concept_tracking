. The Best 30,000 He Ever Spent By HERBERT DALMAS 8 ULIUS V. MADSEN may be a unique phenomenon ? a highly successful corporation president who is broke . He got this way evolving the native-born residents of an impoverished little town  --  Springdale , Utah ? into a prosperous enterprise called Zion Craft Village . A couple of years ago Springdale 's dispirited farmers had average incomes of less than $200 a year , then Madsen got busy , and in 1951 , the first full season of the craft project , the Village showed a highly encouraging profit . What is more , the future seems to assure a climbing income graph that within five years or so will pass the half-million mark . Julius Madsen , a slight , young-looking man of fifty-two , does n't plan to go on being broke indefinitely . Just now he is that way by choice , sincehe specifically set up the craft corporation so that no one but actual producers would make any money from it  --  he being merely the manager . Actually , he derives rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old saying that money is n't everything , for surely a happier corporation president does n't exist anywhere . But even though Madsen is a religious man with a well-developed sense of value , learning the relative value of money was n't any easier for him than it is for most people . A few years ago , in the process of working his way toward a modest fortune in the cosmetics business in Los Angeles , he developed a stomach ailment and found himself spending much of his time and money trying to relieve it . As the doctors were pessimistic about effecting a cure , Madsen found that making money rather lost its attraction  --  except to provide for the family 's future  --  and he figured he could do that in a more tranquil setting than a big city . So he and Mrs. Madsen talked things over , and decided to go to Springdale with their three children and endeavor to prove the gloomy doctors wrong . They chose Springdale because they had honeymooned there , vacationed there each year , and had always loved it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested to them as attractive a way to invest it as they could think of . Each year 300,000 tourists motor down Springdale 's single street on their way to scenic Zion National Park , a mile away and Madsen believed that a profitable number of them could be persuaded to pause for the night . So he bought some land , built a home , and then put up twelve comfortably , equipped tourist cabins . The cabins thrived at once . But within a year Madsen , who is a Mormon , was called by his church to serve as its local clergyman , it being the Mormon custom to settle such duties , without remuneration , upon outstanding laymen . And one of Madsen 's specific duties , as with all Mormon clergymen , was to see to it that the people under his charge were financially self-sufficient . When , presently , he thought up Zion Craft Village to relieve the destitution of Springdale 's farmers , he had to use some of his tourist cabins for workshops , and presently all of them were needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , his remaining money had gone into it , including a mortgage on his house . Madsen 's concept of economic self- sufficiency decidedly does not include relief payments or pointless jobs as an excuse for the dole . Thus those farmers really were a perplexing problem , since they had sunk into apathetic poverty . Madsen did n't consider it their fault , though . Springdale , when settled by Mormon colonists in the 1860 's , was in a fertile stretch of country that would have supported a few families well if scientific farming and conservation had been better understood then . But they let the slopes be overgrazed . Rains became floods that washed out crops year after year , and as the soil became depleted , the colonists had to work harder to produce less . Some of them moved away ; the most faithful struggled on . The second generation stayed , too , but the third left as soon as they were old enough to break family ties . Madsen got state agricult  --  iral experts to examine the Springdale soil , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , rehabilitation was promptly started . Next , Madsen went to a 4-H meeting at Utah State Agricultural College to get some ideas about a course in modern farming that might somehow be channeled down to Springdale . One night he happened to drop in on a lecture by Prof. Floyd V. Cornaby , head of the art department , who illustrated his remarks with some articles he and his students had made by hand . " Some of the stuff , " Madsen recalls , " looked like things I had seen when I was a kid in Springdale houses  --  ladderback chairs , for instance . We had been overlooking possibly the richest of Springdale 's natural resources , the talents of the people . We had been thinking in the usual terms of progress , of catching up with the times , but now we suddenly realized that maybe the quickest way to move forward would be to go back a hundred years . " Madsen tried to engage Cornaby to give a course in handicrafts at Springdale , but the professor had little faith in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One month later Cornaby was at Springdale , not having counted on the formidable persistence which lurks behind Madsen 's easygoing manner . Fifty people attended the first class , ranging in age from sixteen to nearly a hundred , and their attitude toward Madsen 's crafts plan was neither yes nor no , just lackluster neutral . Cornaby started off with metalwork , as the easiest craft to teach , and the first meeting was a howling failure . The second started out just as bad . One of the students was Sarah Winder , a widow in her early fifties . Her husband had been a huge man , and she was tiny ; she had always lived in his shadow psychologically as well as physically , a dominated and submissive helpmate  --  so that when he died , she was lost . The frustrated Cornaby secretly ranked her at the bottom of his discouraging class . As Mrs. Winder was listlessly going through the motions of her work , suddenly she hurled down her tools , leaped to her feet and screamed , " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a sense of panic ran through the whole class . Anyway , this was at last a sign of life , and Cornaby , reacting to it , was at the woman 's side right away . He is a tall , good-looking man with a gentle manner and a reassuring voice . He told her that of course she could do it . Pushing her gently back into the chair , he put the tools back into her hands and guided them with his own hands , assuring her that she could do it very well . Mrs. Winder finished the little metal coaster which had almost been too much for her . Then she started a tooled-leather bag , and her obvious struggle to defeat her sense of inadequacy was watched by the other pupils . They seemed to feel that if she could stick it out , they could too . By the end of six weeks , the class had completed 179 pieces of work . But long before this , Cornaby knew that Madsen 's confidence in these people was sound . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality and talent  --  he even ventures the word " genius " occasionally  --  than he does among students at the university . Madsen 's natural impulse  --  he had been a stage director in Los Angeles before he went into business there  --  was to dramatize the work triumphs of Mrs. Winder and of the whole class . He thought this would be good for both local people and outsiders . So he put on an exhibition of craftsmanship and invited people from neighboring towns . Madsen also had in mind an economic question . It was answered by a wealthy lady from Cedar City , some sixty miles away , who asked if any of the exhibits were for sale  --  she wanted that bag Mrs. Winder had made . There being no precedent for establishing a price , this had to be a matter of discussion , and the Cedar City lady finally left with the exalted feeling of having practically stolen a work of art for fifteen dollars . To Sarah Winder , this was a miracle , the first time she had ever really accomplished something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug hooking under Mrs. Madsen , and presently her work was in state exhibitions . She is n't a " tiny " woman any more  --  make it " petite . " Her hairdo is no longer American primitive but modern urban , and Madsen would n't be surprised to see her marry again . There is a precedent for such late marriages , established during the project 's next phase . Once Madsen was confident that the project would be a success , he was eager to start the furniture program which was the heart of his plan . He procured , as he puts it , " a little aid " to finance the beginning . The implication is that it was some sort of grant , and maybe it was , but at least it is known that up until recently any money that the project has needed has come from Madsen 's pocket . Needing a woodworking instructor , he approached a man named William Morris , of nearby St. George , who had been a teacher of music and of industrial arts . Morris had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was no longer good for anything , had become a recluse . He considered Madsen 's plan rickety , but the offer of work smoked him out . After teaching a class three months for pay , he stayed right on for nothing , because he was discovering in himself talents he had n't suspected . He is now in charge of all woodworking at the Village and is currently making a series of exquisite miniatures of early-American furniture and housekeeping tools  --  collectors ' items in themselves  --  to be used later as models for full-scale production . In one of his early classes , Morris observed , particularly , a lady five years younger than himself , and presently she observed him , and they were married . Mrs. Morris gave up woodworking and went in for artificial flowers devised of crepe paper . A story about those flowers is almost incredibly too pat , but anyway it 's true , and it shows the level of work they are doing at Springdale . Marina Morris got the idea of entering some of her woman-made flowers in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presiding board decided that this did n't make sense and outlawed the plan . As Mrs. Morris was leaving the show building , muttering wrathfully , a state trooper asked her what ailed her , and she told him . " You go get some of your flowers , " said the trooper , " and I 'll sneak them in there myself . " That seemed just fine to Mrs. Morris , and soon she returned with a single pink crepe-paper rose in a bud vase . The story ought to end with her entry winning the grand prize . Actually , it landed only second place , because she had n't realized that pink and red roses have different kinds of leaves , and she had duplicated those of the red variety . The judges figured the wrong leaves were an imperfection in breeding . They failed to note that her rose was n't giving forth scent , but that was n't surprising , as the air was saturated with fragrance . When the deception was revealed , one of the judges not only did n't get mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for the paper rose . Mrs. Morris sold it to her for the regular price of thirty-five cents . A perplexing aspect of Madsen 's project was that in its early phases it brought in no money while consuming a lot of time . The farmers were getting even less farming done than before . This difficulty has been relieved by a THE SATURDAY men 's committee which meets every morning to see who needs help in getting his farm work done , after which everybody who is needed goes over and helps , the way farmers did in the old days . A similar committee of women keeps such domestic programs as canning in high gear . Now more and better work is done in less time than before , and there is more time to devote to the workshop . The first year of the project produced some exquisite handicrafts , but the tourists who stopped seemed to consider the items too expensive . Madsen could have imported cheap tourist-catching knickknacks , but that would have been pointless . George Washington Carver once wrote something Madsen had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have , and work from there . " Springdale had talent and tourists , apparently an inexhaustible supply of both . So , analyzing his problem , Madsen saw the need of finding close-at-hand material for his people to create with , preferably material that d id n't cost money . Always a believer that there is no such thing as waste material , he began to look around . The desert slopes near Springdale are plentifully supplied with a plant called manzanita , which has the rigid consistency of wrought iron . To cattlemen , manzanita is worse than waste material  --  it is menace . A steer which steps into a tangle of it might about as well have walked into a wolf trap . He has little chance of getting out until help comes , and he is almost certain to break a leg trying . Madsen got three or four boys to help him drag a few manzanita plants down to his house . He could n't have chosen a more dramatic way to prove his material theory ? if he could prove it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what to do with the stuff . One of the lads in the group was Hillman Gifford , an eighteen-year-old who was not too happy about life in Springdale . He held a dim opinion of manzanita , and said so . It was Mrs. Madsen who saved this very important situation . Professing to see a basic beauty in the dusty tangle before her , she persuaded young Gifford to saw the ends off one of the clumps and see how it looked then . He did , and it looked awful . Mrs. Madsen got him to saw some more . Still no beauty . But he kept on sawing  --  whether to prove his point that the whole idea was silly or because some hitherto unsuspected urge was stirring in him , no one knows . It does n't matter . What does matter is that he began to see in those gnarled branches the likeness of a duck in flight  --  and no one else could see it . By the time he had finished , he had a wonderfully fantastic " sculpture " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zign Craft Village shop . Last summer Madsen was offered eighty dollars for it and , with Gifford 's consent , refused . It will probably never be sold ; being the first of its kind , it has become a sort of mascot for the whole enterprise . Hillman Gifford went on working with manzanita . He has experimented with polishing it and has discovered a startling beauty in the material . He has modeled from it all sorts of animals , as well as dragons and Indian idols , and has converted it into charming lamp bases and tables . At present Hillman is in Korea . Another young man who has become important to Springdale is Dixon EVENING POST Terry , who is twenty-three When he got out of the Army three years . ago , he came back to his nearby home for what he intended to be a brief visit . He regarded the handicrafts activity with caustic amusement , and the only reason he stayed around at all was that he became interested in a girl . The girl was Connie Madsen  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that either Dixon or their daughter was mature enough for marriage , but they knew better than try to talk two determined young people out of it . Madsen did succeed in getting Dixon to look in on Professor Cornaby 's leatherwork class . The independent-minded ex-soldier , refusing to have any truck with Cornaby 's designs , worked out one of his own , which proved to be easily the most attractive one up to that time . Naturally , he tried out some more designs  --  using native flowers and Indian symbols as motifs  --  and since he soon had more than he himself could carry through to the finished product , he was given a leatherwork class to instruct . Recently , a buyer from a Chicago department store , who came to Springdale to negotiate for ale Village 's entire leather-bag output , said that Dixon 's designs had more originality and more commercial value than any others he had ever seen . Dixon and Connie are now married . This yeas they are going to Berkeley , where the young man will study design at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all production planning at Zion Craft Village , has shown a consistently profitable sympathy with Madsen 's theory that there is no waste material . One day last winter Madsen was putting a log in his fireplace and was struck with the beauty of the bark on the wood he was about to burn . He called Dixon in and said it was a shame something could n't be done about it . Dixon thought it over , designed a lamp with the bark as its surface material , and these lamps now sell for fourteen dollars apiece wholesale . Another Craft Village product is composed of flat stones out of the nearby river bed , branches cut from willows , which the farmers regard as valueless trees , rawhide scraps cast off February 16 , 195= from the project 's chair seats , and turkey feathers from local farms . Children gather these materials after school and make tomahawks out of them under the supervision of a Paiute Indian . Last summer a jobber ordered 50,000 tomahawks at thirty-three and a third cents apiece , and said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park is lined for several miles with signs telling about Zion Craft Village . Such signs are necessary , but they could have been prohibitively expensive to make , and they could have been eyesores . They turned out to be decorative and inexpensive . Madsen got the material from a lumber mill  --  cast-off scraps . The larger pieces served as sign faces , and school children sawed the smaller ones into letters , which they painted with a mixture of asphalt emulsion thrown away after state-road-repair jobs , and water . One thing had to be bought  --  tacks to fasten on the letters . Two motel companies asked Madsen to make similar signs for them , but he would n't because they are n't really a Craft Village product and he likes the idea of there not being any like them . All furniture at the Village is made from native wood  --  dead trees the farmers would ordinarily fell and burn . One variety never used in furniture making before is black locust , up to now considered good for nothing . It has proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village cuts its own lumber and seasons it naturally , but that method soon will lag behind production , and a dry kiln will have to be built . As the Zion Craft Village project is confined to the native families of the town , naturally this brilliantly success-ful restricted enterprise stirs up an occasional reaction from the business people who have moved in from else-where . There are a couple of motels and several stores at the center and east end of Springdale that were set up some years ago by outsiders . The Craft Village is at the western edge , and most of the tourist traffic is from that direction . When Madsen erected two large , eye-catching water wheels flank-ing the Craft shop , the storekeepers farther along would n't have been hu- // man if they had n't been a bit upset . Those wheels would stop a lot of people , and it would never occur to a tourist to stop more than once in a place the size of Springdale . One day a state official came to see Madsen . He was sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to come down . According to an old state law , they were too near the highway . Madsen replied mildly that he would certainly comply with the law without protest . Of course , he suggested , all the other signs in town would have to be examined in the light of the same statute . They were . And the upshot was that the man who had made the complaint hastily circulated a petition to have the law changed  --  otherwise , there would n't have been a sign left in town . Madsen signed the petition without comment and the law was changed . Actually , the water wheels have been good for the whole town  --  and for the tourists too . People still make only one stop , but they stay longer and look around more . Many scenery fanciers feel that Zion and Bryce canyons are even more beautiful than the Grand Canyon . Madsen goes farther , maintaining that the two peaks which form a natural gateway to Zion , with Springdale nestling between them , are more impressive than the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a hurry to get to the park that they scarcely noticed the peaks . Strangers who stop at the Craft Village now are likely to spend an hour or so wandering up and down the street , drinking in Springdale 's own scenic grandeur . Once Zion Craft Village really got started , it became the object of close study by the state of Utah . A project modeled on it is about to start at Escalante , another town in the southern part of the state , and others are being planned . Madsen feels that talents like those revived at Springdale exist in rural communities in every state of the Union . Here , he believes , is a store of wealth , tangible and intangible , which the nation could very profitably tap  --  a natural resource which nobody would have to worry about ever being exhausted . As a business organization , the Craft Village is perhaps unique in its elasticity and the faith everbody has in everybody else . Nobody puts anything into it except time and ability , and no two people draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation the items he makes ; each item is a separate transaction , and some people , of course , make more than others . During the two-month 1951 season , incomes ranged from $20 for the maker of a single metal tray to $1200 for " Aunt Marge " Langston , a tall , handsome lady known to tourists from all forty-eight states as the baker of fabulous bread , cakes and pies . Each transaction between a worker and the corporation must be completed before the article is priced for sale to tourists . Therefore , the enterprise 's success in its early days depended heavily on Madsen 's ability to guess accurately what tourists would pay . Then he and the producer had to agree on a fair price to the latter , with enough spread between the two figures to cover expenses . This system never produced any quarrels , and experience has made it easier to handle . But the demand for Zion Craft Village products has already gone far beyond any possibility of supply by such methods . Selling at wholesale was unforeseen and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development February 16 , 1952 produce , baked products and preserves appear in his kitchen regularly without explanation . If he never gets back all of the $30,000 that , directly or indirectly , went into the project , he wo n't call it a loss . Last June the doctors did an exhaustive checkup on him and could find no trace of the ailment that virtually had amounted to a death sentence four years ago . Today he finds it hard to think of something he wants that he has n't got . His family 's future is secure in the sense that each member is working hard and happily  --  and at something he or she wants to do . Mrs. Madsen manages the Village shop , and her classes in rug hooking are an important part of the Village 's training program . Connie makes dolls on which she realizes a small income , and she is happily married to a man who wants to make the Village his lifework . The Madsens ' older son is coming into the project when he gets out of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pretty much concentrated on high-school football . Most important of all , Madsen has 250 friends whom he has helped to make independent of him and of everybody else . The Villagers are proud of their work ; they know it is authentic and good . One sure way to precipitate an icy silence in any part of the Village is to use the word " quaint . " This pride is something that three years ago they had forgotten the existence of , but now they have the right to it and they know the part Madsen has played in giving them this right . He is , they think , one of the greatest men in the world . And he says he ca n't conceive of anything else he could buy with $30,000 that would be worth a fraction of all that .
