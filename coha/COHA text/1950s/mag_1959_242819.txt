Out of the secrecy that surrounds Washington 's policy planning on the Khrushchev visit , news sifted that hinted at a major U.S. policy shift . President Eisenhower , though he has said that he does not intend to " negotiate " with Khrushchev , intends to suggest to Khrushchev that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. ought to work out ways of cooperating in economic aid to underdeveloped nations . <P> The President 's decision represents a compromise of sharp differences of opinion inside the Administration on how the U.S. foreign-aid program ought to be modified . Nearly everybody is agreed that the U.S. has to get out from under its lonely foreign-aid load ( estimated 1959 spending : $5.5 billion ) in one way or another . The President backs Treasury Secretary Robert Anderson 's concept that the U.S. ought to join with prospering Western allies to create a pool of foreign-aid capital clearly identified with free nations . He has approved Anderson 's plan for a new International Development Association ( IDA ) , capitalized with a joint $1 billion , which will get its first public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank meet in Washington . <P> But Ike , much to Treasury 's surprise , has also heeded the arguments of Ambassador to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge , who supports IDA , but also wants the U.S. to handle some foreign aid through the U.N . Last year Lodge won the President 's approval for a U.S.-sponsored " U.N . Special Fund , " which provides modest sums for pre-investment surveys in underdeveloped countries , also for technical training . Since then , the U.S. has contributed $5,000,000 to the U.N . Special Fund . Lodge now believes that this U.N . Special Fund is the logical mechanism for U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in foreign aid , if Khrushchev is interested in Eisenhower 's new initiative . Says one U.S. hand at the U.N. : " It would be a good thing if both the U.S. and the Soviets decided to get into the Special Fund in a bigger way . " <P> Most U.S. planners are doubtful that Khrushchev will be any more cooperative on joint economic development than he has been in the past ; moreover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency convertibility-are large . But the President , buoyed up by the success of his personal diplomacy to date , intends to press hard for his new approach with Khrushchev this week . As he said in his TV talk with Prime Minister Macmillan in London , " There are millions of people today who are living without sufficient food , shelter , clothing and health facilities . They are not going to remain quiescent . There is just going to be an explosion if we do n't help . "
