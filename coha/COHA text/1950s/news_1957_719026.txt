O'CALLAGHAN , CHARLES ... pg . 25 The writer of . the following letter , a consultant to the State Department , 1949-51 , is director - of the Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy at the University of Chicago . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have been both elated and depressed by Mr. Dulles ' definition of an Ambassador 's qualifications made at his press conference . of Aug. 6 . I am elated because if anybody who has " integrity of character * ' A a sharp and quick intelligence " H and is " genuinely devoted to the public service " is qualified to be an Ambassador of the United States , there must : be tens of millions of American citizens who so qualify . Napoleon said that every one of his soldiers carried a marshal 's baton in his knapsack . If one . takes . Mr. Dulles seriously , one can now say that almost every American keeps an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Post I am also depressed because for a quarter of a century I have tried to impress upon my students how exacting the qualifications of an Ambassador are . I have told them how much knowledge he must have of history , of current events , of foreign countries , of men ; how profound a judgment he must have of . men and situations , and how he must be able to cope with , and transform ; situations on behalf of the policies of his Government . I have quoted the statesmen and diplomatists of the past , who stood in awe of what an Ambassador must be , know and do . Men like Richelieu , Calli  --  res , Mably , John Quincy Adams , Cambon , Jusserand , Harold Nicolson , and many others . I have been particularly fond of quoting the reference of Mr. Dulles ' own grandfather , John W. Foster , to " the baneful influence of political favoritism " on diplomatic appointments and his , approving quotation from a Senate committee report of 1868 to the effect that " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades of diplomatic and consular service and comprehend clearly the nature and scope of his duties . " ( John W. Foster , " The Practice of Diplomacy " pp. 10-11 ) . If I take Mr. Dulles seriously , the only thing I need to tell my students now is : " Boys , be of good character , intelligent and devoted to public duty . Class dismissed . " Harm to Morale Seen It is obvious - that Mr. Dulles can not be taken seriously . In order to defend an indefensible appointment Mr. Dulles has laid down a principle which is absurdly at variance with what Mr. Dulles and all men versed in diplomacy know . Yet by doing so , Mr. Dulles has done great harm to the morale of the Foreign Service and to the public understanding of foreign policy . For he has given authoritative support to those still lingering *popular prejudices which have proved to be such a formidable handicap to the rational conduct of American foreign policy , his own included . Citizens who have integrity of character , are intelligent and devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , if such it is , is not too highly paid for by the lasting damage done to the interests of the United States . HANs J. MoRGENTHAu . . Chicago , Aug. 7 , 1957 . For Fair Prices for Milk To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Is the milk strike inevitable ? All my group wants is 12 cents a quart minimum the year round on the farm , at the 200-mile zone from Columbus Circle . That is for 3.5 per cent butterfat milk . We also want 90 per cent of 1948 ? parity for all milk used . for manufacturing . The State . of . New York operated many . fine herds in connection with state institutions . In many of these institutions they have free labor and all . the land is tax free . Yet the State of New York in its fine state herds charges itself 13 ' , cents a quart . . The average dairy farmer works eighty hours a week at 45 cents an hour . The hours are too long and the pay too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . on farms are between the ages of 10 and 14 . Child labor in industry was banned decades ago . Today dairy ' farmers risk the lives of their children to pay their bills . I have been a dairy farmer for twenty-three years . I am a director of the Dairy Farmers of America , Inc . ? We believe dairy farmers are entitled to the same standard of living as labor and industry . We insist that these inequities be removed . CHANLER A. UHAPP.IAN . Barrytown , , N. Y. , Aug. 8 , 1957. 30th Street Crossing Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a native of the East Side and a resident of East Twenty-eighth Street for ' many years I want strongly to protest against the proposed elevated expressway ' across Thirtieth Street . Many of us remember the bid elevated structure between Third Avenue . and the ferry on Thirty-fourth Street . We know , only too well , how this structure destroyed the appearance of the neighborhood and caused the . depreciation of property . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrosity . disappeared and the sunlight was able to strike Thirtyfourth Street between Third Avenue and the river . The people- dwelling in this area were able to live as human ? beings once more , enjoying God 's sunlight in their apartments , free of the noise and dust of the El . With these memories in mind it is hard for residents of the area to understand why a new elevated structure is proposed after the deinolition of the Second Avenue El , the Third Avenue El , and the El that crossed Thirty-fourth Street to the ferry . The experience of the years has ? shown what these things did to this neighborhood . Therefore , I sincerely hope that when it is necessary a crosstown tunnel will be the solution instead of an elevated eyesore to blight a neighborhood that has suffered from such things for so many years .

Paying for German Assets . ? - Proposed Compensation Declared Burden for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES : The recent White House announcement , on the eve of the German elections , that the Administration will support legislation . next year in the Congress calling . for payment of over $300,000,000 as compensation for vested German assets is most distressing news for the United States taxpayer . This move , long fought for by a myriad of wealthy lobbyists in Washinglon , had up to this time been resisted . by the Justice Deg partment and the Bureau of ' the Budget supported by our allies that had signed the Paris reparations . treaty of 1916 . The principal beneficiaries of this transfer will be large German cor- , porations , some of whom were mainstays of the Hitler regime . In a remarkable about-face the Administration has abandoned its . own bill , H. R. 6888 , under which all individuals who were not war criminals would receive payments up to 810,000 , which would have taken care , of 92 per cent of the claimants . As late as April 3 the Administration in a letter to the ' Speaker of the House stated : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , based upon a full and careful study . " For the Germans the chief issue is one of taxation . If the United States Treasury pays them the ap7. preciated value of their assets , a 25 per cent capital gains tax will be levied . If the German Government pays them , as it was obliged to do by the Bonn Convention of 1952 , a heavy " equalization of bur- . dens " tax will be levied . The attitude of the United States taxpayer , such as myself , is entirely free of any trace of animosity - toward the German people , who have made such magnificent strides on the road to democracy . The issue for Americans is simply whether we should bear this burden ( in addition to foreign aid ) rather than the now very prosperous German taxpayer , largely for the benefit of prosperous German corporations . It is to be hoped that the Con- ; gress give these problems its most careful scrutiny , and reject all considerations based on foreign politics or improper lobbying activities . CHARLES R. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revised Rights Bill Approved To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES The screaming , bouncing , incontrovertible Northern liberal politicians , with pathological meddlesomeness ' and malice toward the South , are bobbing and screaming . more rapidly . and loudly than ever before over the defeat of their Rep.-. construction Bill No. 2 , drafted to ? draw and quarter the South again . They represented their fraudulent draft as a moderate , voting bill . Now , after its exposure and due process , it has been rendered a moderate , voting bill , . and the clamor of their frustration rends the American heavens . Their fraud and deception are bared . Their lies ring louder now than when mouthed . The intent that they harbored is alarming , for it carried like a congenital infection the incipient destruction of America from within . RUDY SIMPSON .
