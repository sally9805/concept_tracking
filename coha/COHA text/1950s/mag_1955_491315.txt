The Things They Say About the Governor ! By HAROLD H. MARTIN W T September , at a huge Democratic clam- bake in Indianapolis , His Excellency , Frank Goad Clement , the governor of Tennessee , turned to the Honorable Big Jim Folsom , the governor of Alabama , a man of equal excellence , and sought his counsel . " Governor , " said Mr. Clement to Mr. Folsom , " what sort of speech do you think I ought to make to these good people ? " " Rough , governor , " said Mr. Folsom . " Rough as a cob . Go out there guttin ' , cuttin ' and struttin ' . " Thereupon Mr. Clement , a handsome , dreamy-eyed , full-lipped young man with the mobile , fine-boned face of a Shakespearean actor , strode to the rostrum and , in a voice which alternately boomed like a siege gun , sang like a mountain fiddle and died away , in moments of emotion , to a dramatic whisper , tore passion to tatters as he heaped scorn , contumely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve minutes , which was perhaps the shortest public address of his career , but he was interrupted twenty times by applause . When he had finished , Mr. Adlai Stevenson , the titular head of the Democratic Party , rose to pump his hand fervently ; Mr. Stephen A. Mitchell , the chairman of the Democratic National Committee , clapped him joyously on the back ; and Rep. Sam Rayburn , of Texas , the temporarily deposed Speaker of the House , spoke to him in a voice fraught with emotion . To the throng , which stood , cheering , as Mr. Clement took his seat , it was clear that no such eloquence as his had been heard from the hustings since William Jennings Bryan , the Boy Orator of the Platte , had come out of the West thundering his defiance of those who sought to crucify mankind upon a Cross of Gold . It was also clear that a new star was rising in the political firmament and that Mr. Clement , unless his larynx failed him , would be a power in Democratic politics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , not only as white-toothed and winsome as the Republicans ' Mr. Richard Nixon ; he was even younger and more handsome , and his oratory made the best forensic efforts of Mr. Nixon sound like an embarrassed schoolboy trying to recite The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck . It was only natural , therefore , that as Mr. Clement , at the request of the Democratic high command , made a great swing through Ohio , Indiana and Illinois , bedazzling audiences wherever he went , a great buzz of talk , unofficial but insistent , should arise . There were those who felt that Mr. Clement was the man to set the hosts of Democracy aflame as the keynote speaker at the National Convention in 1956 . There were others who urged that he not only should perform this chore , he also should be chosen as the running mate to Mr. Stevenson in the presidential race . His barefoot-boy sincerity and his tremendous oratory , which had the power to stir the voter 's deepest emotions , they felt would be in perfect complement to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was largely cerebral . All this talk fell sweetly upon the ears of Mr. Clement , who did not deny that he would accept the keynoter 's assignment with alacrity if it were offered him next year . " Where two or three are gathered together , " he said amiably , " I am always willing to make a speech . Where two or three thousand are assembled , I am even more delighted to have the privilege of saying a few words . " He demurred , modestly , when the suggestion reached his ears that he should run in 1956 as Mr. Stevenson 's vice-presidential candidate , but he did confess that be was willing , even eager , to challenge Mr. Nixon in debate , anywhere , any time , on any subject , particularly on the Republicans ' attitude toward TVA and the Dixon-Yates power issue . To the folks back home in Tennessee it came as no surprise that their neighbors of the Midwest should have fallen under the magnetic spell of their thirty ; four-year-old chief executive . In 1952 , as a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thundering from the stump with an evangelist 's fervor his fiery doctrine that " honesty , decency and morality " must be restored to government in Tennessee . They swept him into office by 57,000 votes over his opponent , Mr. Gordon Weaver Browning , who had inadvertently allowed some of his cronies to lease to the state , for use as an office building , a $620,000 hotel for a total rental of $1,769,000 ? a transaction which Mr. Clement held to he dishonest , indecent and immoral . By 1954 , when he ran again , he was well established in the public mind as an evangelist of the hustings , a Christian chevalier sans pear and sans reprache . His speaking formula was infallible . He would begin quietly , with a fifteen-minute homily on his wife and children , a recital of the little , humorous , frustrating things which beset a family man . Once be had his hearers well warmed with laughter , his eyes would begin to flame and his %oice would boom like a pipe organ , and he would take out after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his audience was in a frame of mind to seek out Mr. Browning and ride him upon a rail . He would close with a fifteen-minute peroration that was purely religious in tone . - Once , in this world , " he would say , " a lonely Figure climbed a ( continued on Page 48 ) 23 lit THE SATt tlt DAV EVENING POST THE THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR !

" As the enraptured throng burst into cheers , his sound truck , parked nearby , would pour forth the strains of a hymn much beloved in Tennessee ? Precious Lord , Take My Hand and Lead Me On . He would then depart , at seventy-five miles an hour , for another speaking engagement , relaxing by listening to quartets singing gospel songs on the radio . In sixty days of campaigning he traveled 52,000 miles by plane and automobile , delivered as many as six hourlong speeches in a day , and shook hands so frequently that a large callus sprouted lietween his forefinger and his thumb . His labors were richly rewarded . Out of 706,000 votes cast , Mr. Clement received 481,000 , and some of Mr. Browning 's cohorts were heard to remark , sourly , that if the campaign had lasted two more weeks their candidate would have voted against . himself . Between campaigns , despite illness , the pressure of official business and the heartbreak of a great schism which occurred in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some length later ? he never lost touch with the people who elected him . In the space of eighteen months , 72,00 ( 1 people , mostly ladies , passed through the portals of the governor 's mansion to pass the time of day with the governor and his lady , Mrs. Lucille Christianson Clement . " Come in , " he would boom to all and sundry . " Call me Frank . And this is ' Cite . I want you to know Once you know her , you will like me better . " On the door of his office at the Capitol he hung a sign reading : WELCOME . COME IN . THIS OFFICE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE . In proof of this , on Monday afternoons he would hold open house for all who sought his ear . seeing them without an appointment , on a first-come-first-served basis , until far into the night . On Sundays he filled the pulpit of country churches , telling his congregation that just because a man went into politics , there was no reason for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me when I took office : ' Son , do n't you slight your God just . because you happen to he the governor of Tennessee . ' And I never have . If a man finds his religion and his politics in conflict , then it is time to change his politics . " Cynical men have been heard to say that the governor 's interest in the things of the spirit did not develop until he discovered that a mixture of piety and politics was a sure-fire formula for election to public office in Tennessee . This seems to he an error . Neighbors in his native town of Dickson , forty miles west of Nashville , remember that even as a small boy he was an earnest worker in the Methodist . Church ; he attended Sunday school without duress , and took an active part in young people 's church organiza lions . There was a lime , in fact , when he showed a strong inclination toward becoming an evangelist , following in the footsteps of such noted crusaders as Billy Sunday , Gipsy Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham . The lure of the bus-tinge , however , proved stronger than the appeal of the pulpit. , and it was obvious , from his earliest days , that he was destined for a political career . At the age of fourteen he placed himself under the tutelage of his aunt , Mrs. Dockie Shipp Weems , whose Shipp School of Expression , at Dickson , was noted training ground for embryonic orators . Under Mrs. Weems he learned many of the platform tricks which stand him in good stead today ? the " proper and natural uses of the hands and feet . and the postures of the body , " the dramatic pauses , the breath control , the massing of rolling periods into a thunderous crescendo . Above all , though , he possessed one great quality which can not he taught . but which all great actors possess ? the power to project his personality , to establish an immediate rapport with his audience , to reach out and twang their heartstrings whether he faced them in person or reached them through the cold mechanics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one friend in appraisal , " has been called a rabble rouser . And t hat , in a way , is so . But he uses his power to arouse in the breasts of the rabble emotions they seldom feel : gentleness , loyalty , patriotism , honesty , loving-kindness and religion . Is that bad ? " While training himself for a career on the stump , he did not neglect to polish assiduously the basic attributes of the politician . At . the age of sixteen , when he and his sweetheart , Lucille , were strolling the tree-lined streets of Dickson on Sunday afternoons , trying to find courage to run away and get married , he would interrupt their meditations by trotting up to every front porch they passed to shake hands with the old folk sitting in their rocking chairs . He would grasp the hand of all he met upon the street , saying loudly and clearly , " Howdy , Mr. So-and-So . I 'm Frank Clement , " and even as a youth he Wile given to complimenting mothers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . After two years at . Cumberland University , where he made a good , but not particularly notable , record , he entered law school at Vanderbilt . In the same year he married his childhood sweetheart , Lucille Christianson , the pair of them , in a borrowed car , running away to Kentucky to he wed at a quiet ceremony which they kept secret from their parents for some weeks thereafter . Once the nuptials had been revealed , Mrs. Clement moved to Nashville to join her nineteen-year-old husband , taking a job at a radio station at thirty cents an hour , with which she managed to feed and clothe her spouse and keep him in school . Feeling a great compulsion to earn some money , Clement took the bar exams a year before his graduation , made the highest . mark in the tests , and began to practice law in a small way while still a student . He graduated in 1942 , at the beginning of the war , and immediately joined the FBI , as a special agent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , accepted him at twenty-two . He served for a year , in Chicago , where he handled matters in the office while the more experienced agents were out tracking down Terrible Touhy , and Lucille continued to augment the family income by working as a stenographer at Marshall Field . He resigned in 1943 to join the Army as a private , went , to Officer Candidate School , was commissioned , and rounded out his military career , as a first lieutenant commanding a military-police company , serving at various bases in this country . Mustered out of the Army in 1946 , he plunged immediately into public affairs , taking a big part in veterans ' organizations , and becoming , largely on the strength of his personality and his vibrant oratory , state commander of ( ( : ontinued nn Page 50 ) // ttttt t t he American Legion . lie also became state elmirman of the Young Democrats Club of Tenneasee , which gave him an ? prior ( unity to address audiences , eit her of veterans or of Young Democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigned , with great effectiveness , for Gov . Jim McCord , who , in his gratitude , appointed Clement general counsel for the stale Railroad and Public Utilities Commission . In this capacity he showed such genius for confounding lawyers represenfing the public utilities that the slat e of Georgia employed him , at $100 a day for twenty-six days , to prepare a rate case ' loins ! : the telephone company , and gave him an additional $5000 to argue the case for three days in the courts . He won handily , and the state of Alabama soon employed his services in the same capacity . Early in the postwar period Clement had come to the attention of two young men , both veterans , who recognized in him n political prodigy who , if properly handled , could go as far in public affairs as any man Tennessee had ever produced , including Andrew Jackson , who reached the White Home . One of them , Leslie . Hart , political writer for the Nashville Banner , who kept Clement 's name before the pullic constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . The other , G. Edward Friar , chubby , hrilliant . Knoxville lawyer who wrote his speeches  --  including the noble invocations with which be concluded them  --  and guided his footsteps unerringly to the governorship in his first campaign , is now his Secretary of State and his bitterest enemy . " I had great ambitions of my own , " said Friar recently , " but when I met Frank Clement f knew that here was a man I was hound to serve in every way I could , all my life . I was willing to forget my own ambitions completely in order to help him fulfill what I knew to be his destiny . What ideals I had , I would give to him . The speeches I could write  --  good speeches that rang with truth  --  I would give to him . All my knowledge of politics I gave to him . For I knew if he became governor , I 'd be there with him . Senator , I 'd be there . President , I 'd be there , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their association , Friar and Clement , half in earnestness , half in jest , had worked out the timetable for his rise to fame . He would run for governor in 1952 ? and win . He would run for a second term in 1954 . He would skyrocket to national renown in 1956 , as keynote speaker at the Democratic Convention . In 1958 , unless some rich plum , such as the Vice-Presidency or a Cabinet post , had dropped into his lap , he would run for the United States Senate . And in 1960 he would he an open , avowed and running candidate for the presidency . To further this high ambition , Friar advised Clement to stay out of politics on the local level , to make no race for the legislature , though he was sure of winning , for in the legislature he would inevitably become aligned with factions , which might hurt him when the time came to make his hid for the governorship . Hart and Friar also advised him to resign as counsel for the Railroad and Public Utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in his spectacular and successful rate fights . It was unwise , they felt , for him to continue to harass the utilities , whose friendship he might need someday . So Clement resigned , passing on his job to Mr. Friar , and set up his own law firm in Nashville in partnership with his father , Robert , a canny small-town barrister from Dickson . This move , however , posed a problem . Neither Clement , sire or son , had much cash on hand . They therefore needed an angel who would pick up the tab for office rent and secretarial hire while they built up a practice . This time Lee Hart came to the rescue . In the legislative session just ended , the Browning administration had defeated a truck-weight bill , to the hitter disappointment of a Nashville businessman named Robert Crichton , partner in a multimillion-dollar enterprise which included coal mines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and a huge highway-transport system operating between New York and Chattanooga , with headquarters in Nashville . Early in 1950 , Mr. Hart persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide financial support for the fledgling law firm while the younger Clement girded himself to unseat Mr Browning in the 1952 election . Mr. Crichton , after conferring with other trucking interests , who seemed disinclined to place a winter bet on a dark horse who so far had nevereven entered a race , finally decided to bear the full cost himself . He arranged for four companies in which he was interested to pay a total of $800 a month to the firm of Clement &; Clement . Before the younger Clement had time to perform any substantial legal services for Mr. Crichton , however , the Korean war was on and Clement was called back into the Army . Leaving his father to run the IIFN .... ivricauni to . EN INC ; 1'i til firm , he loft for Cnilip Gordon , Georgia , announcing boldly that when he WIIK mustered out , it was his plan to run for governor . At home in Tennessee , his friends exerted themselves mightily in his behalf . Eddie Friar arranged for speaking engagements which would bring Clement back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart reported his activities copiously in the preset . Crichton , who on meeting Clement had immediately become a convert to his cause , not only was still contributing his $800 a month to the Clement law firm , he was financing Eddie Friar to the extent of a $6000-a-year salary plus an $8000 expense account , so that Friar could quietly set up , in every county seat , the local organizations which would fight the good fight for Clement when the time came . As a result , when Clement came out of the service , early in 1952 , little remained to be done but to unveil him as a candidate and set him upon the stump . His campaign caught fire from the start . Crichton , accustomed to thinking in terms of big money , was a master fund raiser , cajoling some $300,000 out of the pockets of highway contractors , truckers and others who expected to do business with the state . He also is said to have tossed some $140,000 of his own money into the Clement kitty . Hart extolled Clement 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here were some who believed that Sir Galahad had returned to earth , while Eddie Friar stayed in the Hermitage Hotel for three weeks at a stretch , grinding out statements , press releases and ringing speeches whose texts Clement to a great degree ignored as he got into his famous " weaving way " upon the hustings . The men and women around Clement were a strange mixture of practical politicians , such as Buford Ellington , his campaign manager , and starry-eyed idealists , like Mrs. Jeanne Stevenson Bodfish , teacher of political science , whom Clement had plucked from the Vanderbilt campus to head his women 's division . But old pros and amateurs alike fought for their hero with dedicated zeal . Everybody helped . Pretty Lucille Clement , I hough expecting , clad in a maternity dress , tacked up posters , and Clement 's two small sons ? " This is Bobby ; he s nine , and in the third grade . This is Frank , Jr . He 's three , and into everything " ? appeared on the platform wearing T-shirts emblazoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clement , the candidate 's father , an amiable gentleman , moved about , beaming on visitors , shaking their hand and plying them with literature . Mr. Browning , a veteran campaigner who had served his state as governor three times already , soon found himself reeling under the onslaught of the young White Knight . Since Clement had no political record to attack , Browning attacked his FBI record . Clement as an FBI man , Browning thundered , did n't have the perspicacity to track an elephant in six feet of snow . Maybe he was ineffective as a tracker of elephants , Mr. Clement replied ! But , he said  --  referring to the transaction by which Mr. Browning 's friends leased to the state a venerable hotel at a fabulous profit ? he was sleuth enough to track a shady deal from a downtown hotel room straight into Mr. Browning 's office at the Capitol , No such clandestine transactions would be permitted when he was governor , he swore . When he took his seat in the governor 's chair , the affairs of Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huzzas , Clement was swept into office , at the age of thirty-two , and on the morning of his inauguration a long , sleek Cadillac limousine was parked , waiting for him , in front of his campaign headquarters . Immediately , the waters of the goldfish bowl in which Mr. Clement had sworn his administration would operate began to grow a little murky . By ancient custom in Tennessee , a new governor 's friends present him with a limousine . When the press , however , asked Mr. Clement to identify the well-wishers who had given him so nice a present , he drew himself up sternly and announced that he was beholden to no one for the car . He had bought it with his own money , as a present for his wife . This statement startled Mr. Robert Crichton , who distinctly remembered that , on the governor 's orders , he had withdrawn from the campaign strongbox $4900 in $50 and $100 bills , and had turned the money over to the governor for the specific purpose of paying one Mr. Chandler Beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cadillac . What made the memory particularly poignant to Mr. Crichton was the fact that he did not wish to use left-over campaign funds for this purpose . When , sometime before t he election , the governor-to-be had expressed a strong desire for a Cadillac , Mr. Crichton and Mr. Friar had assured him that he should have one . It was their plan to obtain it , as was the custom , by put ting the bite on the gentlemen who were to be named colonels on the governor 's staff . This plan was knocked in the head , though , when , before the colonels were oppoinled , Mr. Clement announced that the car was ready for delivery , and where was the money to pay Mr. Beard ? Mr. Crichton- was particularly loath to dip into the strongbox , for he sorely needed the cash for other purposes . Four days before the election , the county bigwigs had come into headquarters , asking for funds to oil the ( Continued on rage 51 ) ? ? a I SATILI ElliENI MINI ; OST f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Wheel/4 an that all would run smoothly on Election Day . The till was nearly empty at t he I inw , so Mr. Crichton and Mr. Friar had gorse down to the Commerce Union Bank to borrow $30,000 , Mr. Friar signing the note and Mr. Crichton endorsing it . The $4900 Mr. Crichton gave the governor to pay for the car was money Mr. Crichton was squirreling away to meet the monthly payments on the $30,000 note . Thus the tirat rift appeared between Mr. Clement and his good friend and land raiser , Mr. Crichton . It soon widened . Mr. Crichton had been specifically designated by Mr. Clement as the only man authorized to receive gifts and contributions for his cause . Soon after the inauguration , however , Mr. Crichton learned from Robert Clement that a large highway-construction firm , which had received a substantial contract from the state , had contributed $6600 to help the governor defray his post-campaign expenses . The money had been paid over to Mr. Carl Nicks , of Dickson , the governor 's uncle , and had been passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the money to Mr. Crichton , though , it had shrunk to $4000 . When Mr. Crichton made inquiry about the shortage , Mr. Clement said that he thought too large a bite had been put on the contractor  --  the sum represented about $1000 per mile of paving . Mr. Crichton protested that the gift had been voluntary , and he thought that the war chest should receive the full amount . Mr. Clement demurred . Afterward , Crichton learned from Buford Ellington that . the $2600 had gone into a " little special kitty " which the governor and his father were keeping in preparation for the 1954 campaign . This was the first time Mr. Crichton , who was still struggling to pay off the debts left over from the 1952 campaign , had heard of such a special kitty , and the news disturbed him . He kept his peace , however , for some months , when he brought the matter up again , and the elder Clement , somewhat indignantly , came in and tossed the remaining $2600 on his desk . While Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had existed between Mr. Friar and the Clements also began to cool . The speakers of the House and Senate , and the floor leaders of the House and Senate came to Mr. Friar and told him that ( he governor 's father had been appearing on the floor of the legislature , quietly approaching legislators , offering to help pass certain hills or kill others . What kind of a goldfish operation was this ? they inquired . At about the same time , two gentlemen who had been very helpful to Mr. Clement in his campaign and who had been rewarded by Mr. Friar with some state insurance business called on Mr. Friar . After they had been awarded the business , with , as they thought , no strings attached , they said that Mr. Robert Clement had called upon them and suggested , pleasantly , that they should make a little contribution to the cause  --  say about one-third of the insurance fee . They were n't complaining , they wanted Mr. Friar to understand ; they just wanted to know if this was kosher . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crichton , from one of his own enterprises , also an insurance agency . The manager of the agency reported that Papa Clement had called on him and suggested that state insurance worth $100,000 in premium ) ; lie channeled through the firm . The business could then be distributed to ten smaller companies , which would not violate the new governor 's ruling I hal no one insurance agency should get more than $10,000 in premiums from the stale . The Crichton agency would not appear on the state 's books , and the elder Clement 's fee for making the arrangements would be a nominal $8300 . After pondering this proposition for some time , Mr. Crichton decided , it would be a chance to set a trap for Papa Clement . He ordered his manager to go ahead with this transaction , and Mr. Clement was paid $5000 by check and the remainder in cash . While Papa Clement 's actions were troubling Mr. Crichton and Mr. Friar , Mr. Crichton and Mr. Friar , it seems , were engaged upon certain activities of their own which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered politics in the first place in order to get his truck hill passed , pushed through the House of Representatives a bill raising the weight limit on trucks from 42,000 pounds to 56,900 pounds . The governor signed the hill without protest , hut , when a great hue and cry arose in the press , denouncing the bill , Mr. Clement was irked with Mr. Crichton . He had brought discredit upon the administration , Mr. Clement felt , by the high-handed manner with which he had rammed the measure through . Mr. Friar , the new Secretary of State , was causing the governor even more distress . Elected by the legislature on the governor 's recommendation , his real job was to handle patronage , keeping happy the hosts of job seekers who had thronged the Capitol since inauguration day . Istead of doing this , however , the governor complained , Mr. Friar had spent $3500 fitting out his offices in a luxurious manner , hiring a decorator to do the job without the formality of asking for bids . Instead of seeing the eager job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lolling in a little inner hideaway , listening to soft music on a record player . What was worse , the governor learned , Mr. Friar , an ebullient man , had been seen holding hands on the steps of the Capitol with a lady who was not his wife , and he had even placed this young lady on the state payroll as an employee in his office . This matter of placing people on the payroll was a delicate one . Early in his administration Mr. Clement had called in all his associates and warned them about nepotism . He did n't want them hiring any of his kinfolks , he said sternly , nor did he want them hiring any of their own . Not too long thereafter , the Nashville Tennessean , which had supported Mr. Browning . dim-covered Governor Clement 's Uncle Newt on the prison-farm payroll , where he was listed as a cattle supervisor . When confronted with this fact , Mr. Clement made a dignified statement that his Uncle Newt was doing a perfectly splendid job uuperviaing cattle , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Friar about his young-lady receptionist , however , and when she did not immediately disappear from the Secretary of Slate 's office , he called in his Comptroller , Mrs. Jeanne Bodfish , and told her to wield the ax . The deed was soon accomplished , in a tearful private session between t he two ladies at a local ice-cream parlor called The Whip . In the let-down period after the Great Crusade , all the inner circle who had fought the good fight were developing psychosomatic illnesses . Buford Ellington , the campaign manager , a calm , deliberate man , began having trouble with his stomach . Mrs. Botifigh was having trouble with her stomach , too , and the governor was developing inner ear trouble and a strange aversion to crowds . Latent jealousies and animosities which had been submerged in the " all-for-Frank " spirit of the campaign , began to crop up . Coolness grew between Friar and Ellington , based , their friends say , on the fact that each wanted to be governor , once Clement had moved on to greater glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though pleading for a revival of the old team spirit , managed to contribute to the general unrest . He would call in his people , one by one , and question each about the others , taking down their answers on a recording machine which he had concealed beneath his desk . Now and then , all hands would make a desperate effort to patch up their differences , and there were several tearful sessions at which they pledged that they would stop their fussing and rededicate themselves to the Clement cause . These love feasts always broke up , though , over the issue of whether or not Frank should be told about the activities of his father . Friar strongly objected . The governor , he argued , would be completely overwhelmed by such a revelation . Finally , though , the decision was made to tell the governor all . To their great surprise , he took the news calmly . As Mrs. Bodfish remembers it , he said he saw no reason why THE SATURDAY EvcrqiNG POST anyone should object if his father , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little something for the sock . " " It was like dying , " said Mrs. Bodfish feelingly , " It was like finding out there was no such thing as heaven , that there was no honesty and integrity left in the world , " Thus ended the trust and friendship which had existed between the governor and three of those who had been closest to him . He was angry with Friar , Crichton and Mrs. Both-lab for their accusations against his father . They were bitterly disillusioned with him . From then on , two hostile camps dwelt sullenly aide by side beneath the to er of the Capitol . No word of this unhappy situation leaked out , however , until time came for Clement to run again last summer , this time for a term that had been extended to four years . Whe n James Stahl-man , publisher of the Nashville Banner . heard rumors of the rift , he called Friar , Mrs. 130dfish and Crichton to his apartment one Sunday afternoon . There they laid on the line their accusations against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done had been with the governor 's knowledge and consent . They left with the feeling that they had convinced Mr. Stahlman that Mr. Clement was not a man that an honest newspaper could support . They even remember Mr. Stahlman 's saying , somewhat irrelevantly , that he had always suspected as much , ever since he had noticed Mr. Clement wearing light-tan shoes with a dark-blue suit . An hour after t hey had left , Clement , Les Hart and Buford Ellington arrived . Clement heard the charges against him , and , in an hour of persuasive eloquence , refuted them one by one . The next day the Banner announced its support of Mr. Clement 's candidacy . The Banner probably had no other choice . The Tennessean was supporting Browning . And the Banner and the Tennessean , though bound by business ties into one financial operation , hate each other editorially with a venomous hate and belabor each other savagely in politics . In fact , it is said in Nashville that , if a man and a gorilla were running for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other one would have to hack the gorilla and extol him as a statesman . With a new money man , Mr. Russell Brothers , an ice-cream manufacturer , keeping the war chest filled , and a trio of new writers grinding out the sonorous speeches which Mr. Clement used or disregarded , as his unerring sense of crowd reactions dictated , he swung into the tight for a second term . It was one of the most acrimonious political battles in Tennessee history . Mr. Browning 's verbal onslaughts on Mr. Clement , the Banner thundered angrily , were " vehement , violent , vicious , venomous and vituperative , " designed to arouse savage passions and to drown out the voice of reason . There was no doubt that Mr. Browning was swinging his verbal battle axes with prodigious zest . While his bands played a satirical parody on Oh , My Papa , he assailed the elder Clement for his meddling in the affairs of government . The shadow of Papa Clement , he thundered , " hovered like a harpy over the Capitol . " In answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commandment ? " Honor thy father and thy mother . " From cradle days , he said , he had sought the advice and counsel of his male parent in all matters and he would continue to do so , so long as the Heavenly Father spared him . And who among his hearers would advise him to do otherwise ? He revealed a genius for goading Mr. Browning into intemperate statements . When he berated Mr. Browning for twice pardoning a convicted rapist , Mr. Browning in an angry outhurst roared in reply I hat , " If it were not for the pardoning power of a merciful God , Frank Clement would have been in hell long ago ! " Clement got a transcription of this startling statement and played it hack to horrified audi ences , his only answer being a quotation from the Book of Micah : " What , Both I he Lord require of thee , hut .

Beneath the clangor from the hustings ran a hitter whispering campaign . Mr. Clement , I he murmurs ran , was the type of man who kept a bottle in his closet at which he nipped in secret . Mr. Clement was also a man of ( Continued on Page 58 ) ttttt st ( nee reies 35 ) unruly passions who made passes at pretty girls . In this , as in all their of her efforts to discredit him , Mr. Clement said Inter , his opponents went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling it around I had I had thirty-four girl friends scattered around over Tennessee , " he Said . " If they had said I had one , or two , maybe somebody would have believed I hem . " Even his bitterest enemies agreed that the whispering campaign about Mr. TI S 11 ' Clement 's private life got out of timid and defeated its own ends . Mr. Clement. , though profoundly disd ' irked by Ilw whispered attacks on his character , made no effort to answer I hem publicly . Convinced that his foes would stoop to any ends in smear him , though , he took certain precautions . He never went on a campaign trip without his wife or one of his children with him . He never entered a hotel room or stepped out into a hotel corridor alone , without first peering about warily to see if I he coast was clear .

" As I he campaign roared on into July , with Mr. Clement confounding his enemies at every turn , his erstwhile stanch supporters , Messrs . Crichton and Friar and Mrs. Bodfish , maintained a stony silence " We did nothing to hurt him , " said Mr. Friar . " But we could not find it in our hearty to try to help him . " Then Mr. Browning brought up again the old issue of who had paid for Mr. Clement 's Cadillac . Reporters got Mr. Crichton on the phone in New York , and from him wormed the statement that he " could not deny " that he had handed t he money la the governor to pay for t he car . This brought the schism into the open . Mr. Clement denounced Mr. Crichton . Mr. Friar came to t he support of Mr. Crichton with the statement that he , ton , had been present and had seen the money passed , in a brown envelope which the governor had thrust into the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press and announced that it had become his painful duty to reveal to the world what sort , of political vipers he had been nourishing in his bosom . He produced copies of letters which , he said , he had written to Messrs . Friar and Crichton six months before , on . January twenty-eighth. in which he had cast them both into outer darkness . In the letter to Mr. Crichton , he said he had been " shocked and hurt " by the manlier in which Mr. Crichton had rammed the truck bill through . He accused Mr. Crichton of seeking to channel all the state 's tire business through his own tire firm , and he charged that Mr. Crichton had sought to control the State Purchasing Department , the Department of Highways and the Safety Patrol , in order to gain favors for his friends . In conclusion , he wrote : " With every good wish for your continued good heal ! h for you and your family , I can only leave with this parting thought , Bob . You have several million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or anyone else to roll them of this wealth . I have only my good name to leave to my children , and it is worth far more than your millions , and neither you nor anyone else , in or out of politics , will lie permit ted to take away from my family the only thing I have to leave . " His letter to Mr. Friar was similar in tone . He spoke of the deep love he once had felt for Mr. Friar . He then rebuked Mr. Friar for decorating his office lavishly . and made glancing reference to the young-lady receptionist . He accused Mr. Friar of trying to influence highway contracts , and he charged him with conspiring with " profiteers who sought to make unconscionable amounts of money out of the state . " " After prayerful thought , " he said , he had decided that " ii is impossible for me to continue a political friendship with h you and at the same time furnish honest , decent and moral government , to the people of Tennessee . " Publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Crichton . Neither , they swore , had ever received such letters , in January or any other time . Mr. Friar then called a press conference at which he produced documents to prove that , long after these letters were allegedly written , he still was working earnestly for Mr. Clement , suggesting to him the names of men who might he nominated 5 fora judgeship , writing public utterances for him and trying to sell his services as a lecturer to an agency called the Alkalies ' . Celebrity Bureau . He then hired an expert on questioned documents , who , he hoped , could prove , by examining the original copies of the letters , that they had not been written six months before , but had been written only a few days after Mr. Crichton and Mr. Friar had publicly denied Mr. Clement 's story that he had paid for the Cadillac with his life savings . When the expert. , a Mr. J. H.

In a TV appearance on the eve of the election , with the flowing rhetoric he once had employed in writing Mr. Clement 's major speeches , he lambasted his onetime friend . The only issue before the people , he said , was simply this : " Is Frank Clement what he says he is ? I , the Jonathan who knew our David best , and loved him most , will answer that question . " His answer , in elect , was - No . " " There are two Frank Clements , " Mr. Friar roared ? " the one he wants you to think he is , and the one he really is the one we all believed in in 1952 is imaginary and nonexistent ! The real one is coldly ambitious , calculatingly deceptive and selfishly dedicated to his own cause , and no other ! " Mr. Clement , " Mr. Friar thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known the most deadly weapon known to man , which is the power to persuade ! Thus , with this weapon he is able to mislead and deceive , to pretend that lie is one individual when in truth he is another , or several others ! ... The truth is that the present governor shows to you , the people , a glittering , marble , shining facade , bejeweled with ornaments of zircon , while behind the marble archways of fraud and falsification reeks the refuse of distrust , dishonesty , dishonor and disrepute ! Never in the history of our state has such a colossal fraud been perpetrated on the people ! .. . " Mr. Friar might as well have yodeled this message from an Alp . The people surged to the polls and gave Mr. Clement 481,000 votes , a plurality of 286,000 over his opponent , Mr. Browning . The Clement express was still on the rails , traveling on the exact timetable laid out for it years before ? by Mr. Friar .
