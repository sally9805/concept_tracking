" I propose , " said Dwight Eisenhower in his State of the Union message last month , " to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia including the Federal Government . . . " Last week the Administration began making good on the pledge : in a brief filed with the Supreme Court , Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . made the Administration 's case against segregation in Washington restaurants . <P> Said Brownell : " Several hundred thousand federal employees , representing every segment of our population , work and live in the District of Columbia area . It is the established policy of the United States that its employees shall be hired , and shall work together , without regard to any differences of race or color . " As amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) , Brownell sided with the District corporation council in appealing for reversal of a lower court decision invalidating an old District of Columbia anti-segregation ordinance.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
