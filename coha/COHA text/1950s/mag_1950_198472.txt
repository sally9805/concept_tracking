To catch its share of the swarms of postwar tourists , the proud city of Antwerp ( pop . 266,636 ) has been delving into its rich old attic and displaying its heirlooms-the work of generations of Flemish craftsmen and painters . This summer Antwerp is trying something new . <P> Its burgomaster and aldermen got the idea last year when they went to see a modern sculpture show in The Netherlands ' Arnhem ( pop . 103,666 ) and came away determined to beat the Dutch . They vowed that it would be " necessary to the renown of Antwerp to do better than is done elsewhere . " <P> The aldermen thereupon got busy assembling one of the most comprehensive shows of 20th Century sculpture ever seen in Europe . Last week it was on exhibit in spacious Middelheim Park . Already a first-rate tourist-catcher , the show would run through September . <P> Its 166 sculptures ran the range from the realism of Auguste Rodin and Aristide Maillol to the tortured what-is-its of contemporary abstractionists . Among the standouts : Rodin 's cape-shrouded , beetle-browed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , and Ossip Zadkine 's roughhewn Statue for a Garden . Such statues were easy to look at . Old-fashioned visitors to Middelheim were not so sure about some of the others . <P> In the center of one broad lawn , standing like a nightmare clothes rack with triangular metal planes hung out to dry , was a quivering Mobile by U.S. Abstractionist Alexander Calder . Sprouting from the grass like a strange new species of mushroom were a pair of coldly obscure stone lumps by Englishman Henry Moore , who had laconically dubbed them Carving and Sculpture . Near by perched two glistening , seal-sleek shapes entitled Crown of Buds and Bad Fruit , by ex-Dadaist Jean Arp . " The most obscene works in the show , " commented one visitor , " but nobody realizes it . " <P> Antwerp took no official position , one way or another , on the sculpture in its big show . But the city fathers could read the press reviews with pride and pleasure . Acknowledged Brussels ' Le Peuple : " Antwerp . . . never does things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
