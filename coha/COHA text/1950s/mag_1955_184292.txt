If you , . . utter speech that is not <P> intelligible , how will anyone know what is <P> said ? For you will be speaking into the air . <P> I Corinthians 14:9 <P> On this text the Rev. Liston Pope , dean of Yale Divinity School , last week addressed the Broadcasting and Films Commission of the National Council of Churches . The increase and popularity of religious programs is often cited as a happy sign of a wide religious revival in the U.S. , but Dr. Pope found little on the U.S. air to be happy about . No irate sponsor has ever given TV and radiomen a sharper tongue-lashing. * <P> Terrible Brotherhood . " Religious " radio and television falls into two categories , said Pope . One is the airing of sermons , services and music , and it is occasionally effective , as in the case of Queen Elizabeth 's coronation . " But music designated as religious ranges from the syncopated nonsense of Jane Russell and her confederates to the noblest arias of the human spirit . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us not designate it all as religious , or even as music . " <P> The second category of religious programming he found even worse : " First of all , there are the popular skits about wholesome families , presumably model Christian families ; some of them are the best argument for celibacy advanced since the Middle Ages . I would never have believed that anything could be stickier than some of the soap operas , but religion has outdone even Lever Brothers . The difficult art of Christian family life is reduced to little moralisms and pleasantries , and to the cheerful conclusion that it pays in the end . . . Religion is introduced as a fragment of ritual , or a moralistic cliche , or an offstage voice quoting Scripture in a mellifluous voice . " <P> Then there are the programs that offer solutions to personal or social problems under the guise of religion . If there is Christian truth in them at all , it is generally a crumb fumbled off the whole , meaningless or misleading by itself : " For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Fatherhood , which is seldom mentioned . . . and mere brotherhood is offered in the name of Christianity as a nostrum to keep America strong . In the name of God , this kind of thing represents a prostitution of the Christian faith and a crucifixion anew of the Christ who put human brotherhood in the most terrible and demanding of all relationships , that of common sonship under God . Let us have brotherhood , but not by all means . " <P> A Song or a Shot . Dean Pope also gave the back of his hand to the " peace-of-mind cult . " He objects to identifying Christianity with it , no matter how popular it is or how many people claim to have been helped . " The mambo is popular , and innumerable people have been helped by patent medicines , hospitals and social-work programs , but not every popular or helpful thing is to be described as Christian or presented under Christian auspices .
