txt *Congress is insisting upon giving the President all-out standby wage and price-control authority for which he has not asked , and quibbling over details of the lesser powers he has requested . Meanwhile , Mr. Truman told his press conference that he is not contemplating the revival of the World War II Office of Price Administration . Both houses are at work on the control legislation , in direct floor debate minus the usual time-taking committee hearings . The House came out of last week 's stalemate over the issue to vote overwhelmingly for broad , drastic controls over wages , prices , and rationing , on a standby basis , and then bicker over the lesser curbs over inflation for which the President wants immediate authority . Legislators Balk The legislators balked at giving the President unlimited control over credit , voting that he be given power only over the regulation of consumer and real estate credit . There is also objection to giving him the authority which he has requested to curb speculation on the commodity exchanges . Such speculation generally feeds on government buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The House , in voting to put wage-price-rationing authority in the President 's hands , to be used if necessary , rejected a proposal to freeze wages and prices at their present level . It also voted that if price controls are applied , wage controls must be employed at the same time . A one-year limit was put on the legislation . Senate Debates The Senate , considering a companion measure , was just beginning debate on it , as the House prepared to wind up its work . Aside from the stand-by pricewage-rationing authority which was Congress ' own idea , the President asked for a moderate program ( 1 ) to establish priorities and allocate scarce materials , ( 2 ) establish controls on installment and mortgage credit , and ( 3 ) extend government loans to help industry expand defense production . This , the President has contended , is all that he needs at this time to step up the home front to the tempo of the defense effort . Since the outbreak in Korea seven weeks ago , mobilization has been going forward with increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the armed forces for expansion . The army has called for 100,000 draftees during September and October , ordered up 43,000 national guardsmen , and 62,000 unorganized reservists . The marine cos just announced mobilization of all of its 80,000 volunteer reservists , beginning with 50,000 to be called up between Aug. 15 and Oct. 31 . This was the second call , with marine reserve ground twits and several air squadrons already placed on active duty . The navy has called up reserve specialists and air squadrons . The air force has been calling up reserve units and individual specialists . Congress has removed the statutory ceiling of 2,005,000 on military manpower , and " frozen " 295,000 men in service by extending their enlistments for an additional year . Spending Soars Defense spending has been stepped up to bigger figures which Congress now is considering in budget form , with $11,100,000,000 marked for the armed forces and $600,000,000 for increased stockpiling . Aircraft manufacturers are gearing their plants to fulfill $4,400,000,000 in new orders . Synthetic rubber production will be increased by 100,000 tons yearly , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal income and corporation taxes , is another important piece in the jigsaw puzzle which rapidly is falling into shape , as home-front strategy is brought in line with the necessities of the military front .
