A young Vietnamese came running across the paddyfields to Thaibinh one day last week from the nearby village of Thanthuong . This was his story : <P> " This morning about 9 o'clock , young men and women carrying rice , vegetables and baskets came into the market at Thanthuong . They mingled with the local crowd . We thought they were peasants from a nearby village having something to sell . As we knew later , all were Communist guerrillas wearing peasants ' clothes . The ' women ' were young Communist soldiers carrying hand grenades under their coats instead of breasts . A few of these visitors started a dispute with a woman about the price of a chicken . It was a trick to divert our attention while others were encircling the village . We heard a whistle . Knives , grenades , submachine guns came out of the baskets carried by the Communists . With submachine guns firing , they made their way through the screaming crowds . One group entered the church . I heard a blast of machine-gun fire and screams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the noise was about . I saw the Communists shooting with rifles on the children . I do n't know how many were killed because I escaped at this moment . " <P> Two days later , a French Union column reached Thanthuong . Of its 2,000 people , only 600 remained ; 25 were known dead , the rest had disappeared . A French colonel continued the story : " The shops that were the pride of Thanthuong were completely looted . We found the body of a six-year-old child , strafed with bullets . Inside the church , all statues of saints were broken , their heads and hands chopped off . The big statue of Christ was broken . The Catholic sisters ' cloister , an orphanage and a school ... all that was left standing were a few bits of walls . " <P> The sole reason for the Communist onslaught appeared to be the prestige of Thanthuong 's Dominican priest , Father Barthelemy An . He had made Thanthuong a peaceful refuge . Father An once gave his flock 300 borrowed French rifles to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead .
