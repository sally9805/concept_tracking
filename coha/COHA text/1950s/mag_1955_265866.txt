In a message to the Union of Italian Catholic Jurists , Pope Pius XII reminded the lawyers that however hard it may be even for theologians to believe it , eternal punishment is a dogmatic fact . " Revelation and the teaching authority of the Church clearly establish that after the end of this earthly life , those who are burdened with grave guilt will receive from the Most High God a judgment and an execution of penalty from which there is no liberation or condonation . God could , in the next life , also remit such a punishment ; everything depends on His free will ; but He has never granted it and will never do so ... Such a divine disposition is in no way contrary to any of God 's attributes ; neither to His justice nor His wisdom , neither to His mercy nor His goodness .

Last fall 's enrollment : 28,760 . <P> The Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Louis University , declared in a newspaper interview that income-tax evasion is morally as well as legally wrong .

It is therefore " hard to conceive what more could be required of a legislature for a law binding in conscience . "
