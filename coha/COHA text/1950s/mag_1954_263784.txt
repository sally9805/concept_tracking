The scene : India 's Upper House of Parliament . The issue : U.S. airlift of French reinforcements across Asia to Indo-China . The question from the floor : Would the U.S. Globemasters " transgress " Indian territory ? Prime Minister Nehru 's reply : " It has been the policy of the government for the past six years not to allow foreign troops to pass through or fly over India . " There was indeed such an Indian policy , but Nehru chose to restate it in a desperate hour when his remarks would give sharp offense to the U.S. ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Parliament got the point ; M.P.s cheered him wildly , and newspapers headlined NEHRU 'S AIR BAN round the world . <P> Two days later Nehru defined the war in Indo-China to his own satisfaction : " The conflict is in its origin and essential character a movement of resistance to colonialism . " Nehru rounded off his oration by saying the U.S. threatened the peace of Southeast Asia . He had nothing to say about Red China .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
