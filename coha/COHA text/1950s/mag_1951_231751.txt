There are not many chapels like the brand-new one which visitors streamed through all last week in Winston-Salem , N.C. It is tiny-only 9 ft. by 15 ft. - and is built into the mezzanine of a 20-story office building . But its originality lies chiefly in the congregation it is designed to serve : the employees of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . ( Camels , Prince Albert ) . <P> Reynolds took the first step in 1949 , and it was a bold one : engaging the Rev. Clifford H. Peace , a 40-year-old Methodist minister , as " pastor-counselor " of the company , Reynolds President John C. Whitaker posted the company 's reasons on bulletin boards at the office building and at each of the company 's eight factory buildings in Winston-Salem : <P> " All people at some time in their lives become discouraged or confused . Perhaps they are worried . . . hurt . . . ashamed ... or have trouble making up their minds ... When people have these problems , they often need someone to talk to-a person they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes they would rather not talk about these things to members of their families or to their friends . That is what Mr. Peace will be here for-to listen and help if he can . " <P> " People as Individuals . " Reynolds officials had mulled over the project for a long time . They had observed that good industrial relations need something more than shorter hours , higher wages , free medical care and pension plans . Many employees found their personal problems so overwhelming that their working ability was affected . What was needed , Reynolds decided , was not simply psychiatry , but " the faith that gives purpose to life , belief in the ultimate victory of good over evil , and dependence on a wisdom greater than human reasons or resources . " <P> Meanwhile , Clifford Peace had been considering what kind of minister he wanted to be . As chaplain at a replacement depot in England during World War II , he talked to thousands of men . " I saw statistics turn into people , " he says . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not just shoot into the covey . " <P> Almost the first thing Pastor-Counselor Peace did at Reynolds was to ask for the chapel , get its design and construction approved and into the works . Then he settled down to learning the job and writing the rules as he went along . Six hours a day for eight months he walked through offices , factories and warehouses , personally meeting 12,000-odd employees . For two hours more each day , he let it be known , he would be in his office for counseling . Only a few came at first , but gradually counseling work increased . Before the end of his first year , he had 475 visits from employees in search of help . Management officials , employees and Pastor Peace himself feel that the experiment is already a clear success .
