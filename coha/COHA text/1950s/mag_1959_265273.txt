Fireman or Arsonist ? <P> Sir : <P> Why do you suggest that Paul Tillich 's vacuities are in any sense " A Theology for Protestants ? " TIME , March 16 . Theologians have often noted that Tillich 's philosophical system has affinities with the ancient Docetic heresy , which was roundly condemned by the church . <P> Theologian J. Marcellus Kik recently wrote a parody on Tillich and Bultmann entitled " The King 's Existential Garments " - with apologies to Hans Christian Andersen . <P> <P> ( THE REV . ) JAMES G. MANZ First Saint Paul 's Evangelical Lutheran Church Chicago <P> Sir : <P> Sometimes we wonder if these existentialists are firemen or arsonists ! <P> Apparently , Christianity is lost if it must use Theologian Tillich 's philosophy to support it . <P> WILLIAM F. BURKE JR . Founder and President National Psychiatric Reform Institute Altamont , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> Tillich may be a great thinker , but human thought does not manufacture God . God is ! Theology-totin ' Tillich has got the cart before the horse . Prodigal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to grab hold of his straying child . That 's why his son came out of heaven , chasing after man . <P> <P> ( THE REV . ) BERTWIN L. FREY Messiah Lutheran Church Fairview Park , Ohio <P> Sir : <P> I , too , am a Jesuit professor of theology of many years ' standing , as is Father Gustave Weigel . May I politely dissociate myself and St. Mary 's College from the " sustained brilliance " which Father Weigel sees in the confusion confounded that is Paul Tillich ? AUGUSTINE KLAAS , SJ . <P> Saint Mary 's College Saint Marys , Kans . <P> Sir : <P> Your excellent resume of the giddy theology of Paul Tillich suggests the possibility of his having ridden on the same train with the little girl who , on leaving Virginia , shouted : " Goodbye , God , we 're moving to Arkansas .

Its motto to this day is Di Henos Panta ! ( Greek : All things through One , Christ ! ) . Its foremost tenet has been the principle of chastity , followed by the principles of temperance and non-dueling . To say the least , many of us are perturbed by the " achristian " theological meanderings of our fraternity brother and fellow Lutheran , Tillich . <P> <P> ( THE REV . ) T. R. BAUDLER <P> First Charg , Wingolf University of Erlangen ( 1935-36 ) Zion American Lutheran Church Eureka , S. Dak . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Dr. Tillich has been for some of us the cathartic of Protestant traditionalism , providing a much needed theological and ecclesiastical enema . His thought is like the ocean - you can enjoy it from shore , you can cool off your feet , you can wade in and swim , you can jump in the middle and swim , but unfortunately , as the Herr Professor would be the first to agree , if you swallow too much too fast you can drown . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian Church Madison , Wis . <P> <P> Sir :
