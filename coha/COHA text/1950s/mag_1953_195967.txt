Defense Secretary Charles Wilson won his battle in Congress to cut $5 billion out of the Air Force budget for 1954 , but in so doing he freely promised that the cut would not damage the combat effectiveness of the Air Force . Last week , attempting dutifully to tailor its cuts to fit the budget , the Air Force gave a fateful answer to Charlie Wilson 's promise . <P> The first cut came , quite naturally , in personnel . Current strength of the Air Force is 980,000 , and it was building to a planned strength of 1,061,000 next year . Wilson 's budget imposed a ceiling of 960,000 . To get under the ceiling , the Air Force is dropping 15,000 reserve officers from active duty during the coming year . Among those to go will be nearly 2,200 pilots , some of whom have checked out in the U.S.A.F. 's backbone jet bomber , the B-47 . Firing experienced personnel will have a direct effect on Air Force combat-readiness , but the cuts must be made to make room for this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the Wilson budget the Air Force also plans to : <P> Scrap plans for a buildup to 133 combat wings by next July and substitute a goal of only no wings . Though Air Force brass would like to see most of this cut come out of the 28 tactical wings which the U.S. has promised to NATO , Air Secretary Harold Talbott passed the word that the U.S. NATO commitment must stand unchanged . The alternative : a major reduction in the planned size of the Strategic Air Command and U.S. air-defense forces . <P> Eliminate some 64 supporting air units , e.g. , transport , and 89 ground logistical units from the buildup program . <P> Cut training of new pilots from 12,500 a year to 7,200 . <P> Cut authorized flying time 20% , a grievous blow to the precision training of combat crews . <P> Abandon construction of 22 combat air bases and 32 supporting installations ( radar , supply , training , etc. ) which would have been completed at the end of the fiscal year , leaving a total of 199 combat bases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T36 trainers and 72 assault transports . <P> One of the most critical elements in the buildup of U.S. air power still hangs in the balance . Holding that there is no need to reorder production-model aircraft more than 21 months in advance , Wilson will wait until the next fiscal year ( beginning July 1954 ) to decide whether the Air Force will go through with plans to buy 1,500 more combat planes , most of them supersonic fighters . But the decision already seems clear : to pay for these planes , the Air Force will need $1.5 billion more than it got in this year 's budget ; already Budget Director Joseph Dodge has decreed that overall defense appropriations must be cut another $5 billion in fiscal 1953-@@818789 Inching upward for a fifth straight month , the Government 's fever chart on living costs touched a record 114.7 in mid-July ( base : 100 for average prices in years 1947-49 ) . Reason : increased rents , some higher food prices ( pork , poultry , eggs , fresh milk ) , higher costs of medical care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft and automobile workers , whose pay is tied to the cost-of-living index . <P> Treasury Secretary Humphrey took the report without flinching . Said he , noting that the increase is only a fraction of a point over the mark of twelve months ago : " That is a most eloquent demonstration of a stabilized economy .
