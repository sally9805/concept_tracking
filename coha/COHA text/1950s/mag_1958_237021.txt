On the eve of the crucial U.S. nuclear-weapons tests at Eniwetok Proving Grounds-tests of such basic defenses as the first nuclear-tipped ground-to-air antiaircraft missile , the first deep-water anti-submarine nuclear depth charge and the low-radioactivity " clean " bomb-the uproar over the tests and their fallout got both more shrill in its public aspects and more sensible in its scientific debate . <P> In Honolulu , the pacifists who had threatened to sail their ketch Golden Rule into the Eniwetok blast area were jailed for defying a court ordering them back . From French Equatorial Africa , Dr. Albert Schweitzer renewed his stop-the-tests plea , with trimmings of benign neutralist disengagement . <P> In Washington , New Mexico 's Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson , prestigious vice chairman of Congress ' Joint Committee on Atomic Energy , accused the Administration on Meet the Press of talking about clean bombs while stockpiling dirty bombs-even " inserted something that makes them dirtier . " The Defense Department denied it . Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss resented it . President Eisenhower said at his news conference : " We have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more local and advantageous use of the nuclear weapon rather than just a shotgun method . " <P> Carbon 14 . As that uproar quieted , Nobel Prizewinning Chemist Linus Pauling , 57 , head of the chemical labs at the California Institute of Technology , made headlines with his newest point : the most dangerous element of nuclear-test fallout over a period of five to 10,000 years is not strontium 90 but carbon 14 , a low-radioactivity but long-lived ( half-life : 5,568 years ) isotope that from tests already held will , said Pauling , cause 5,000,000 defective children in the next 300 generations . Atomic Energy Commissioner Willard Libby , one of the world 's top authorities on carbon 14 , replied that bomb tests had not produced enough carbon 14 to cause more than " very minute " danger . He added : " Why should we continue nuclear-weapons tests ? The answer in its simplest form is , in my opinion , that they are necessary for defense . " <P> Three senior scientists at Columbia 's Lament Geological Observatory wrote that most of carbon 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the increase of carbon 14 in the atmosphere was 50 times too high . Pauling 's figure : 10% ; the Columbia figure : .2% . And the remaining radiation " would be considerably less than that received from the luminous-dial wristwatch worn for about two hours a year . " Added they : " Exaggerated statements by respected scientists only add to the public 's confusion . " <P> Political Reasons . Indiana University 's famed Nobel Prizewinning Geneticist Dr. Hermann Muller , who had signed Pauling 's stop-the-tests petition of 9,235 scientists ( 2,749 from Communist Rumania ) , staked out his view that while the scientific perils of fallout have been exaggerated , tests ought to be stopped for political reasons- " desirable for the easing of tensions .
