Can We Foresee The Future ? by JOHN RADER PLATT IT TAKES 20 years to raise a child . It would help a lot to know what kind of world we are raising him for , not merely in its toys and excitements , but in the habits and customary comforts that will support his sanity . It is true that the future is uncertain , but not so uncertain as some may think . To prove this , it is only necessary to look for a moment at some of the old scien ? tific prophecies of a generation ago to see how accurately they have turned out ? and where they went wrong . Take Edward Bellamy 's book of 70 years ago , Looking Backward , 2000-1887 . This is a Socialist tract cast in the form of a Utopian novel , which had a great influ ? ence on the social thought of the last generation . It is hung on a dream formula and baited with a quaint love affair ( " sugar crystal , " Heywood Broun called it ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social and technological changes that could occur in a city such as Boston by the year 2000 . What does it prophesy ? Sociologically , that Boston could be a communal society , with money entirely re ? placed by ration cards . This does not look quite like Utopia to me but from time to time , depending on what state of emergency we are in , it does look like a dull possibility . In Boston of 2000 , messages would be shot from place to place by pneumatic tube , and lighting will have become artificial . But all this was up-to-date when Bellamy wrote ! The telephone , the pneumatic tube , the electric light , all belonged to the previous 20 years or so . On the technical side , Bellamy 's most daring prediction is a kind of home radio or loudspeaker connected with a central station by telephone lines , with a choice of four programs . His heroine " merely touched one or two screws , and at once the room was filled with the music of a grand organ anthem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens ( the women have a " faultless lux ? uriance of figure " ) , did not come to be so through the marvels of medicine . In 1887 , Pasteurization and anti ? sepsis were still being argued . X-Rays were eight years A HUNDRED YEARS AGO Thoreau was writing of the rapid changes brought by the railroad and of the telegraph that would connect from Maine to Texas . He adds , of course , that " Maine and Texas , it may be , have nothing important to communicate . " In Life on the Mississippi , Mark Twain comments re ? peatedly with some little pride on the rapid technical and social changes taking place at the time . But during the last 50 years , things have been happening so fast that one school of social scientists identifies " social lag " as one of the major problems of our own society . No LONGER DO WE build houses or offices , or plan parks , to last for a century . Anything we construct is likely to be obliterated well before that time by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made obsolete by new ways of living . Al ? ready the first steel skyscrapers of the early 1900 's are being torn down to make room for much larger ones , or for parking lots . These days a man can scarcely plan ahead even as far as his own retirement . Those beaches you may have planned to park beside may be drowned or oil-slicked or radioactive before you reach them . In 30 years , the forests of the Arctic or the craters of the moon may be dictated by pres ? sure and fashion and transportation as the ideal re ? tiring places . Is it idle to plan for the future ? Can we confidently predict the shape of things to come ? in the future . Medicine was still in the hands of doctors and had no marvels . Thus , the physical superiority of people in the 21st Century would be achieved , Bellamy said , mostly by " the effect of untrammeled sexual selec ? tion . " Up-to-date again . Darwin 's theory of sexual selec ? tion had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores of the year 2000 were to be like Roman temples , the clothes flowing robes , the attitudes between the sexes genteel . It is all charming and in many ways forgivable . But a Utopian who limits himself to the technology and romance of his time , to the almost-believable , limits himself as a prophet . The most revo ? lutionary party of Utopian reformers , complete with un ? dercover agents and mass meetings , may not remake society as fast as a single new invention . If a man does not know what is technically possible and probable , what new devices may stabilize or unstabilize the commerce between men , he is severely handicapped when he tries to foresee what is possible in politics or in the distribution of wealth . The desire for automobiles may bring eco ? nomic and political equality faster than the desire for equality . In America , the year 1940 outdid Bellamy 's 2000 , perhaps in social reform as well as in automobiles . Yet if we turn to prophets who were better informed technically , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in 1902 . Wells , as we all know , was a marvelously successful forecaster . He imagined , decades before they appeared , nuclear weapons and robot battles , and space missiles reaching for the moon and Mars . And Anticipation is not fiction but a serious at ? tempt to estimate what can happen in the remaining 98 years of the 20th Century . What does it predict ? First , and most successfully , the social effects of the horseless carriage . Wells sees it multiplying into millions of private cars . He sees trucks and busses . Repair shops . Great roadways . Displace ? ment of the railroad . Enlarged cities , with suburbs and commuters . And for war , " ironclad road fighting ma ? chines . " But his transportation predictions for the whole cen ? tury were fulfilled ' in 25 years ! Airplanes ? He ventures to say , " Very probably before 1950 , a successful aero ? plane will have soared and come home safe and sound . " And then hastens to add , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever come into play as a serious modification of transport and communication . " This was written one year before Kitty Hawk . Wells estimated very well the future shape of war . He foresaw trench warfare with its stalemates ? the con ? sequences of the machine gun ? and how they would give way in turn to aerial blitzkrieg . He foresaw the domi ? nation of war by science , and he states magnificently the central fact of the modern world : " The nation that produces in the near future the larg ? est proportional development of educated and intelligent engineers and agriculturists , of doctors , schoolmasters , professional soldiers and intellectually active people of all sorts . . . will certainly be the nation that will be the most powerful in warfare as in peace , will certainly be the ascendant or dominant nation before the year 2000. - Later , in The World Set Free ( 1914 ) , Wells even foresaw nuclear weapons and the possibility that they might make war impossible . He predicted that they would be achieved about 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good understanding of the gestation time for research and development . He was writing just a short time after the physicist Soddy had first conceived that the atomic energy in a cup of water could drive a ship across the Atlantic . ( " That dreamer ! " the other physicists called him . They were still calling him that in 1939 . ) Yet we realize suddenly that Wells is not anticipating really new intentions at all , but only the consequences of things already done in his time . The airplane had already been foreshadowed by glider experiments and by Langley 's model . Wells foresaw helicopters , but in all his predictions before World War I , there is nothing like radar or jet propulsion or long-range rockets , all of which came within 30 years . There are no steel skyscrapers , no plastics , although they were almost upon him . In biology , Wells imagines growth hormones , ( The Food of the Gods , 1904 ) , but nothing like vitamins or plasma ; no new drugs or poisons like salvarsan and penicillin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electron microscope . Wells , the eager and speculative and successful , was too tame for history . After World War I , the prophets realized that they had to be bolder . But the story is much the same . Listen to Wells again , older and wiser , in The Shape of Things to Come ( 1932 ) ; and Aldous Huxley in Brave New World ( 1928 ) ; and J. B. S. Haldane in The End of the World ( 1923 ) . In the next few hundred years ( Hal ? dane says the next few million ) , it seems we are ' to have helicopters and wrist-watch telephones or television . Clothes will be zippered , plastic and disposable . Hal ? dane has rocket space-ships for colonizing other planets , and tidal and solar energy for moving mountain ranges and controlling climate . In biology , life is to be prolonged and old age abol ? ished . The unfit will be sterilized . People will be like full-page color ads , larger than life , aseptic , healthy , committing suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new senses . New plants and animals created by artificial mutations . A Bureau of Hatchery and Conditioning producing children to order , with their minds carefully shaped for their destined social roles . Promiscuity . " Everyone belongs to everyone else , now . " A planned society , kept stable by incessant amusements . Alas , these fantastic futures have a familiar look , one not so different from the current headlines in The New York Times . They are here now , the wrist-watch phones , helicopters , moon rockets , wonder drugs , synthetic plants and animals . Solar energy has its millions for research ; islands are destroyed and mountains moved by atomic bombs ; manipulating the weather has become a big busi ? ness . Mindshaping and Miltown , artificial conception , promiscuity and the pressure of amusements ? they are old familiars to us . And atomic energy is not even in these particular forecasts , so that they were already sur ? passed by the first atomic pile in 1942 . Today we trans ? mute the immutable elements almost as routinely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors in these forecasts are not to be cured by making prophecies wilder . That is the path down which science fiction has been increasingly driven : Prophecy becomes indistinguishable from fantasy and all connection with real live descendants disappears . I think that for good forecasts , whether for a single industry or for all society , what we need is more realism , not less . And we need a careful examination of the elements that make up a good prediction . For the best political programs and legislation become dubious in the shadow of our ignorance about the technological future . An interesting corollary is that if technology drives society , society vulgarizes technology . This is Aldous Huxley 's repeated point . The grand organ anthem on Bellamy 's Utopian radio becomes a singing advertisement for liver pills . The degree of vulgarization of a device will be one of the hardest things to predict . It may depend on trivia , and on variables such as the methods of distribution . For example , in America , broadcast net ? work radio has been more vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to reach a mass market to collect its fee . When good local FM stations took away the more selective part of the audience , radio be ? came more vulgar still ; when television took away the less selective part , it improved . Evidently anyone who tries to prophesy the full social impact of an invention will have to understand the detailed nature of the individual feedbacks in a competitive situation , questions intimately connected with secondary technological tricks , economies and legalisms . But this is getting ahead of the primary question , which is the forecasting of technological developments themselves . This can be done successfully , I think , if three steps are clearly separated : the anticipation of in ? ventions , the calculation of their development time and extent , and the estimation of their social consequences . Most persons will probably agree that the second and third of these steps can be accomplished if the first can be . Development times and markets , for example , are the natural province of vice presidents and research directors ; and a lively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social consequences . Start ? ing from embryonic inventions , the prophets whom we have just looked at did these two steps very well , and none of them had had any experience with industrial research . But by contrast , a number of American atomic scientists testified after World War II that Russia would develop her own atomic bomb in four to ten years ? when generals were estimating 30 years , or never ? and four years turned out to be correct . In 1948 , I heard two well-known physicists making bets on whether man would reach the moon by 1960 ; today , a year after the first Sputnik , this still looks like a good target date . For unbiased men , accuracy in such matters is a question of experience . They take into account the fact that every device and idea has its limits . Trains and automobiles reached their final cruising speeds within about 40 years after they were invented . The mechanical theory of matter goes only so far. * Science and technology do not grow like a balloon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeast , each bud reaching its limit and then new buds forming . By the time an idea has its Nobel prize , it is becoming exhausted . Only the new guesses and speculations that spring from it have any capacity for growth . But what of the first step ? anticipation of inventions ? It is not necessary to be the inventor in order to see the general shape of things to come . In the first place , in ? ventions as well as discoveries are not single but multiple , made simultaneously in many different places when the time is ripe . " There are now so many physicists that their behavior is becoming statistical , " one of them has said . A technical development generally rests on , and is planned from , an older substratum of ideas and related work , just as the voyages of Columbus and Magellan were implicit in Eratosthenes . A group working in one field goes ahead in the general direction set by work al ? ready done . Many of the discoveries they make , and most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence to a large extent fore ? seeable . S OME research organizations now operate on such a large scale that the work of invention and even dis ? covery can be programmed and can be partially turned over to an engineering development group . This shows us at the same time the second aspect of invention that makes it predictable : It is a social process , satisfying social wants . Whenever a highly concentrated research program gets under way , the technological improvements become limited not so much by what is possible or by what an Edison can think up as by what men desire . If a result is impossible one way , it is often possible an ? other , and the only problem is to run through all the conceivable methods until the right one is found . In this real sense our conveniences and gadgets are simply wish ? ed into being , when we wish hard enough . Men wished to fly , and they got balloons ? fire bal ? loons , gas balloons and Zeppelins . They wished to fly without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propeller plane , the helicopter , the jet plane and the rocket plane , involving three differ ? ent motors . Such overlapping inventions might be even more nearly simultaneous if the appearance of the first success did not drain research energy for some time away from the other possibilities . To separate U-235 , four dif ? ferent schemes were devised . All worked . Today we have not just one , but many different kinds of nuclear reactors and bombs and power plants . As soon as a problem can be stated clearly , we are within a generation of solving it . Of course , the prophet must be careful . The new toy is not likely to be exactly what was expected and it may not be as useful as antici ? pated . Automatic dishwashers , unforeseen , can come and change our lives while we afe still waiting for the moving sidewalks that many of the early oracles predicted . Going to the moon is not a matter of physics , but of economics ; the engineering advances that steadily make it easier are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? mental restriction is encountered , we get around it by twisting our wants or rephrasing the question . We take an airplane instead of a flying carpet . The motion picture gives us many of the pleasures of the time machine and far less dangerously . Nevertheless , the fact that we are usually able to will into existence some approximation to our desires reduces the burden on the prophet of technology . The most im ? portant thing for him to do is to look realistically at what human beings want and need and will pay for ; at what the research laboratories will move to after they have done what they are doing now ; and at what the details are of cost , convenience and advantage , that determine the military , commercial or private acceptability of new devices . Obviously he needs to know science inside and out , but within certain broad fundamental limits his central question is not so much " What are the scientists going to find ? " which is hard , but " What can we think of ? " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How soon can it be ready ? " which are the easier . THE laboratories are the focus of successful prophecy , technological or political . Perhaps 10 men in 10 fields ? the hot hundred ? are the ones who deter ? mine in detail the shape of tomorrow . Oddly enough , even these , with their noses to the blackboard , do not always want to face the truth of how fast their latest pure theories will be transformed into daily necessities , or how fast inconceivable invention will be created . One does not have to be a prophet to see that generally , barring catastrophe ( whose form is also predictable and has a certain probability ) , the shape of the year 2000 must represent what the great laboratories are working on most intensely today . To serve the doubled population of that time , with its doubled cities and doubled traffic and desperate expansion of birth control and conservation measures , atomic power will dominate the scene . There will be solar power . Probably fusion power . Planes and rockets everywhere , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ion propulsion . Fabulous metals and ceramics . New practical devices from fundamental nu ? clear physics . Remarkable understanding of molecules and of solids and liquids . A hundred-fold better knowl ? edge of the new experimental fields of astrophysics and of deep oceanography . Cheap , versatile communications , television everywhere . Fantastic slave devices : automatic control systems , computing machines for every kind of problem and policy , thinking-machines , pattern-recog ? nizing and learning machines . Accurate prediction and control of weather . In biology , the abolition of disease , the manipulation of species , and an understanding and control of heredity and growth such as we hardly dream of . Solutions to many of our great riddles ? photosyn ? thesis , vision , genetics , enzymes , antibodies , cancer . A hundred-fold better understanding of the brain . And I see the laboratories turning to many problems almost untouched today . New batteries and portable fuels for vehicles . A fundamental rethinking of clothing and shelter . Farming the oceans . Ina recent book , Professor R. L. Meier has listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population explosion which are not being worked on today . It would be interesting for an organized forecasting group to work out the details of these predictions of the world for 42 years ahead . The believable we do in this generation ; the conceivable in the next . The third generation we do not understand . To estimate such far-off invention , I can only conclude that within very broad limits , the best guide is not going to be a technical guide at all , but simply the knowledge of what men deeply want . Today the limitations on the development of science and invention in the foreseeable future seem to be set only loosely by nature , more tightly by the abilities of exceptional minds , but most tightly of all by the human desire and its balance of values . Among our many desires , the most powerful are the simple ones . To be warm and full and free , these are our first needs , the needs that can erupt in violent revolution , but they are not all . What dissolves and remolds societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sweet smells , music , pictures , entertainment , bright lights and powerful servants . We want to make magic , to run like the wind and fly into the birds and talk across the miles and be as beautiful as gods and know how everything works . In the Western world , I think these longings are part of a deeper dream . Prometheus , Daedalus , Franken ? stein , Faust ? there is psychological and racial truth for our questioning Greek minds in the dark power myths of human technical mastery stolen from heaven . This scientific age is the very time of their surging up and ful ? fillment and they burst daily into reality among us . It is the edge of creation we skirt , recombining the genes and the viruses . Our monsters twitch , almost alive , as the antennae , the sense-organs and reflexes , the electronic brains and computers of planes and ships and guided missiles become ever more animate . Some people today seem to pull back in horror as they once shrank fascinated from black magic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dream big enough . Was ever the imagined transmutation of lead into gold ? that pretty relic of savage trade ! ? even a fraction so overwhelming as that of uranium to plutonium , which never was on land or sea , and then plutonium into everything ? Even the names give the nightmare dream away : Uranus , the god of heaven : and Pluto , death . And today we fly up to the very spheres on which they move . To be accurate over the long run , the prophets of society will have to speak the language of technology , but they will have to dream as deep as myth . In the past , the serious ones have shrunk from such simplicity . They have spoken of what men can do , not of what they will to do : So their predictions have suffered always from a lack of realistic imagination . The mad dreamers were evidently not mad enough.r It is time for some madder realists to learn to prophesy .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
