Everest had been scaled , man had run the four-minute mile , and last week the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series . <P> After half a century of futility , and seven failures ( 1916 to 1953 ) in World Series tries , Brooklyn 's first world baseball championship came the hard way . The Dodgers were up against baseball 's greatest money team , the New York Yankees , unbeaten in seven series since 1942 . The Dodgers lost the first two games ; no team ever had come on to win a seven-game series after such a poor start . Even when they erased the deficit by winning the next three games , the Dodgers ' hopes were still dim . Those three victories came in their own cozy Ebbets Field , where the fences are in easy range for hitters . But the seventh series game , the payoff , was to be played in spacious Yankee Stadium , the vast Bronx lot out of which no hitter , not even Babe Ruth , ever drove a baseball. + <P> Scarce Hits . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Manager Walter Alston sent 23-year-old Johnny Podres , a slender ( 6 ft. 170 Ibs. ) lefthander who had spent most of the season on the Dodger bench . Alston 's logical starter , 2O-game winner Don Newcombe , was down with a sore arm . Podres , who " won only nine games in the regular season , had not lasted a full nine innings in league play since June 14 . In late summer , the Dodger front office thought of shunting him to the disabled list and bringing up a minor leaguer who might be more help . But Alston gambled on starting him in the third series game , and Podres beat the Yankees . The manager and Podres himself were confident that the youngster could do it again . " I 'll shut them out , " said cocky , gum-chewing Johnny Podres . " I can beat those guys seven days a week . " <P> During one of the tensest World Series ' finishes ever played , Johnny Podres made his prediction stand up . Brooklyn 's Catcher Roy Campanella , First Baseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits to score single runs in the fourth and sixth innings . The Yankees came clawing back every time , getting men on the bases and bringing the potential tying or winning run to the plate . Once the Dodgers were saved by a brilliant running catch by Left Fielder Sandy Amoros . But their best defense was Podres ' zipping fast ball , carefully assorted with well-disciplined slow curves that kept the Yankees swinging off balance throughout the afternoon 's siege . Finally , a gentle grounder rolled to Dodger Captain Pee Wee Reese for the last putout . <P> Free Beer . The borough of Brooklyn ( pop . 2,848,000 ) erupted with joy over their beloved Dodgers ' first triumph . A blizzard of paper and ticker tape fluttered from office buildings . Barkeepers served beer on the house , and lunchroom operators handed out free hot dogs . Snake-dancing and parades went on all night . Life was so complete for one Brooklyn rooter that he tried to end it with a suicide leap off Brooklyn Bridge .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
