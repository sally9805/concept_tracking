SIR HENRY ( 187 pp. ) - Robert Nathan - Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> The dragon was a scaly monster with a forked tongue and hooked claws . He politely requested the knight 's identity . " I am Henry of Brentwood , knight , " the knight replied . " My father was Sir Tiffany of The Glen , and my mother was an enchantress . " <P> " Nonsense , " said the dragon . " Your mother was a kitchen wench . . . " <P> " She enchanted my father , " said Sir Henry simply , " and the enchantment was strong enough to bring me into the world . " <P> With that , Sir Henry tried to charge , but his nervous horse backed away . Soon the dragon was spitting clouds of smoke and fire . As the monster opened his mouth wide , horse and rider were so scared that the knight dropped his spear-right into the dragon 's mouth . It killed the beast stone-cold dead before you could as much as say Saint George . <P> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By slaying the dragon , he , of course , won the damsel . Lady Alisane , the dragon 's ward , had been idly waiting around to be rescued , and as soon as the battle ended , she stepped forward and offered her knight some tea . <P> Second Maid . The world of Sir Henry was made by Novelist Robert ( Portrait of Jennie ) Nathan . It is located at the intersection where whimsy and satire collide . It is a slap-happy world , in a well-bred way , where the fish are philosophical . " There are creatures beyond us ; for I have seen their shadows , " says a trout to a nonbelieving chum , who thinks all there is beyond is an absence of water . " Do they lay eggs ? " asks the chum . " They are altogether spiritual . " says the trout . As for the dogs , they are even better than the fish . They are romantic . " If you had wings , " a he dog murmurs to a she dog , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan is really aiming at , of course , is man ; in the shape of Sir Henry , he makes a fine target . No longer young , prudent Sir Henry is just a run-of-the-mill knight who wears old-fashioned armor , travels with a hot-water bottle and suffers from nosebleed after battle . Head up , though run down after his encounter with the dragon , he is lucky enough to beat the daylights out of another knight and win a second fair maid . This doubles his troubles . With two women to choose between , Sir Henry becomes the eternal , quintessential male - totally incapable of making up his mind as he holds on to both of them . <P> Suburban Bliss . Sir Henry is sufficiently tired to realize that his quest is not for glory and the Grail , but for the cozy security of a small castle with a hot-and-cold-running moat . But once he finds his medieval version of suburban bliss and the itinerant mnage trois settles down , he feels he is committed to being a hero . So off he rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest foe a man can have : himself . It is a battle that Satirist Nathan does not allow his Every man to win . <P> Novelist Nathan is that literary oddity , a lineal descendant of James Branch Cabell . Their type of gently spoofing , satirical fantasy is not much in vogue these days , but Author Nathan is an expert practitioner of the genre . His touch is light , his fish are intelligent , and his dogs and dragons are shaggy.
