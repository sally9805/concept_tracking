Cockney Quxote <P> OLD SOLDIERS NEVER DIE ( 224 pp. ) - Wolf Mankowih- Atlantic-Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . <P> We are Kitchener 's Army The Army of the Free We can not shoot , we can not fight What bloody use are we ? <P> Thus with proud self-derision the Old Contemptibles* of 1914 sang as they marched to battle . British Author Wolf Mankowitz has written a superb novel about an Old Contemptible who has lived beyond his era , beyond World War II ( when everything was " more efficient " ) , and on into the Welfare State . The old fellow recalls the recruiting poster of World War I , " Kitchener Wants You , " and adds his sardonic comment : " He 's about the only bastard what does . " <P> The old soldier 's only surviving name is " Old Cock , " and his last surviving grip on Britain 's economy is a job as curator of a rubbish dump in London 's bombed-out East End . Slightly addled but still marvelously eloquent after his life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as " Arp " ( from the initials on his Air Raid Precautions uniform jacket ) . A bomb had deprived Arp of everything - house , family , name , memory and speech . But Old Cock talks enough for two-his language flows like pig 's ear in a boozer on Saturday night and is rich as hot gammon . In a country of free teeth he has only five blackened stumps ( " tombstones " ) and possesses nothing much but a cherished tapeworm , which he " gasses " with liberal quantities of raw onion . But his friendship with Arp glows like the lavatory float of " valuable copper " in a desert of uncommercial junk . <P> Bowlers &; Rozzers . Novelist Manko-witz evidently sets up these two old human ruins as symbols of man 's condition on earth , with well-meaning officials as their natural enemies . The officials are the book 's runts and spivs and riffraff-the ones who have fared best under the Welfare State . Old Cock pegs them down ( to quote the most printable of his memorable vocabulary ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man is quite a social thinker . After one brush with authority-represented by an arrogant doorman-he reflects : " If we have to take to wearing bowlers before we can get a bit of simple cooperation from our fellowman , who shall not be spat on from a mighty height ? " <P> The novel 's plot concerns Old Cock 's attempts to hold on to his job and to keep Arp secure in his Nissen hut , located on the edge of the garbage dump . Among his adversaries are not only the city authorities and the garbage men ( who have no respect for a well-conducted dump ) , but a film company run by a madly implausible American operator named Claygate Corst . Though Corst does n't have " enough do-re-mi in his pocket to acquire a second-hand mouse-trap , " he takes over the decayed movie studios next to the dump . At this point the whimsicality that infects British writers when they deal with cockneys unfortunately takes over the novel . Old Cock arrays himself in a junkpile suit of armor and routs the rozzers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come , you lousy whoresons ! " <P> " You 'll pay for it , " they shout back .
