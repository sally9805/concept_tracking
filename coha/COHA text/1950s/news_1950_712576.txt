txt Letters Letters SCIENTIFIC AGE TO THE EDITOR : Henry Steele Commager 's " Five Great Problems of the New Half-Century " suggests that more democracy can meet these awesome challenges but neglects to even mention the power of the spiritual force of men . The intellectuals often neglect to mention this eternal power of God in man , reflected as a mirror , because they think religion is finished in a scientific . age . FRANCIS J. BAssETT , State Teachers College . Oswego , N. Y. Dr. Commager wrote , of " the major problems " that confront the world : " Their solution depends not on machinery and techniques but on the control of machinery and techniques to beneficent ends . It is fallacious to suppose that because we live in a scientific age , science will solve our problems . " ? Editor . WHY TICKET BROKERS ? To THE EDITOR : After reading Marguerite Cullman 's " Two on the Aisle , " an excellent expression of the playgoer 's eternal gripe , one question still remains unanswered : Why , precisely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since I plan soon to be in New York and am , in spirit at least , already one of " the theatre 's devotees , " the answer is of considerable interest to me . The only virtue in ticket brokerage is avoidance of the long trek from one theatre to another in search of a show not sold out . However , the central ticket agency suggested by Miss Cullman would do a better job and could be controlled to maintain only the legitimate mark-up . ROSANNE KLASS . Madison , Wis . CITY REPERTORY To THE EDITOR : As a rabid playgoer who usually attends at least one Broadway show a week from Jose Ferrer , pioneer . October to May , I read with great interest Maurice Evans ' ideas for an " Old Vic " in New York ( " An ' Old Vic ' for New York , " by Thomas Whiteside ) . Where such previous ventures as the American Repertory Theatre failed , perhaps the City Center Drama Company , subsidized by New York City , can succeed . Mr. Evans is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline of theatre patronage on high admissions . One way to reduce the price of tickets is to abolish the amusement tax . It is time that Mayor O'Dwyer did something in Washington about it . To get back to the City Centel Drama Company , Mr. Whiteside did not mention the spadework done by Jose Ferrer and Richard Whorf . Mr. Ferrer in particular deserves mention for his tremendous efforts in organizing the project two seasons ago . ALBERT LEE . New York . CHURCHES To THE EDITOR : On the cover of THE TIMES Magazine for Dec. 25 there is a picture of a beautiful New The church on the cover . England church . Unfortunately , its location is not given . Will it be possible for me to receive this information , also the location of the church shown in the lower left-hand corner of Page 12 ? LUELLA OTIS BEAMAN . New York . In response to this and other queries from readers : The church on the cover is the First Congregational Church , New Canaan , Conn . Originally founded in 1733 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates from that time . The church is one of two , the other being St. Mark 's Episcopal Church , which stand close together facing a triangular green which , for that reason , has come to be known in New Canaan as God 's Acre . The church portrayed in the lower left-hand corner of Page 12 , also Congregational , is in Middlebury . Conn. ? Editor . NEW MUSIC To THE EDITOR : Aaron Copland in " A Modernist Defends Modern Music " asks why the musical public is so reticent about accepting contemporary music . There may be two explanations . First , people too quickly jolted from Mozart , Beethoven and ? Brahms into the unfamiliar Schoenberg , Vaughan Williams and Hindemith are forced into indifference by so // // sudden a change . Only a small minority of people will force themselves to allow something alien to " grow on " them until it is familiar , acceptable , not unpleasant . * * In my own case , however ( and this is the second possible explanation ) , I have repeatedly tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary music ? in vain . I believe the reason is that I have found a complete lack of any universal aspect in twentieth century music . While such music bears a definite trace of the times in which it is written , it seems it does not have that which transcends all time , which gives art an appeal to all ages . ESTELLE M. SHANES . Salisbury , Vt . NEW AND OLD TO THE EDITOR : I was delighted with Aaron Copland 's " A Modernist Defends Modern Music . " It is stimulating , informative and amusing . If Mr. Copland hoped to create controversy among his readers I am sure he has succeeded . My own test when listening to new music ( and I do listen ) is whether or not I can bear it to the end . If I can , then I know I like it , even without understanding it , or I find it interesting and exciting , sometimes satisfying and rewarding . I may go so far as to admit that I would like to hear it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to hear new works often enough . I also agree with him that " most people use music as a couch ; they want to be pillowed on it . " * * But does Mr. Copland imply that the music of the " romantics " puts you to sleep , does not stir you up ? If so , I hope he heard " Elektra " at Carnegie Hall recently , and the glorious Brahms Fourth . Let us have the new music , lots of it , along with the " putyou-to-sleep " kind , so that we may increase the " absorbent capacity " of our all-too-sensitive ears . ANN BUSSERT Noawoon . Old Lyme , Conn . MODERN MODERNS To THE EDITOR : As an amateur of the arts , I am content to bump along twenty , thirty , eveh a hundred , years behind the times . So I felt surprised when I read Aaron Copland 's " A Modernist Defends Modern Music " and realized that of the twentyeight or twenty-nine composers mentioned I was familiar with the works of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had copies of some of the works of all but three or four on my shelves . Perhaps I , too , was modern . But when I realized that only one ( Britten ) was appreciably " Unknown " Edgar Varese. younger than either Mr. Copland or myself , I wondered if , alternatively , Mr. Copland was afflicted with a Joshua complex  --  that the sun had been standing still for a long time . I suppose you ca n't publish the story of the genuinely modern composers . They 're probably so busy making a living by performing , teaching , or reviewing other people 's music , that they literally earl hear themselves think . PRESTON ROBINSON . Williamstown . Mass . DISCORDS TO THE EDITOR : Re Aaron Copland 's " A Modernist Defends Modern Music " * the uninitiated music-lover does n't know that there is a law which governs the composition of music . Whenever a composer writes a discord he is violating the laws of harmony , make no mistake about that . And if he does n't quickly repent in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild time of it . ' " * * Mr. Copland , as most moderns , argues that dissonance after all is relative . What may be a dissonance to me may be a clash of harmonious beauty to him . Maybe so . But , thank God , my tastes are n't so perverted as not to know the difference between black and white . If we stick to the law , we ca n't go far wrong . I wish some contemporary composer would find a genuinely new idiom  --  rich , solid and affirmative . Let us be done with negation . What a challenge for a composer with a great spirit ! CURTISS GROVE . New York : ICE CREAM RECORD TO THE EDITOR : Julius Duscha , in " A Change in the Menu , " writes that ice cream was " almost unheard of at the turn of the century . " He derived his information from a study by the United States De- - partment of Agriculture . What nonsense these so-called " official " statistics make ! There were hundreds of small confectionery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ice cream , and likewise throughout the country . Ice cream vendors roamed the tenement districts selling " hokey-pokey a penny a lump . " Countless families produced their own home-made ice cream . I venture to . say the kids of that day consumed more ice cream than Mr. Duscha 's modern ex- ' ample who revels in an inferior article at ten times the price . S. ROSE . New York . VICTORIAN To THE EDITOR : Congratulations to you and Prof. Henry Steele Commager for his fine , searching , comprehensive comparison of the nineteenth with the first half of the twentieth century ( " 1950 : From Victorian to Atomic Age " ) . Only those of us who basked in the refulgence and relative calm of a part of the nineteenth can fully appreciate the vast difference in the atmospheres of then and now . As youths , we faced the future asking only for the opportu nity to achieve our own success , and assured of that . We meant to get security through our own efforts and not as a gift from others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unscrupulous . No labor leader , excepting in a few industries , could demand tribute for permitting us to work . No powermad Government could tax us // // to near-poverty to strengthen its own power . We had fewer material things but more happiness ? more anticipation of same ? than the youth of today . May the new year show them a better road than the one they 're facing . W. H. CONNrRS . Philadelphia . ram TO THE STARS To THE EDITOR : When reading Sir Charles Sherringtan 's " Mystery of Mysteries : The Human Brain , " and more especially the quotation from John Milton : " Not prone and brute as other creatures , but endued with sanctity of reason ( who ) might erect his stature , and upright with front serene govern the rest , " I was reminded of Ovid , who , long before Milton , wrote in his " Metamorphoses " : " And , whereas other animals bend their looks downward upon the earth , to Man he gave a countenance to look on . high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stars . " MARGARET W. BROEXHIMEN . Branford , Conn . COLLECTIVISM TO THE EDITOR : In " Are We Headed Toward ' Collectivism ' ? " Senator Harry F. Byrd , if not Senator Paul H. Douglas , makes a vigorous assault on " collectivism . " Then , turn a couple of pages and read Gertrude Samuel 's article , " Report From Dafne in Galilee , " whose subheading states , " One of Israel 's collective settlements shows how deserts and swamps are made to bloom , " and which is illustrated with beautiful pictures of what " collectives " are doing . These contradictory articles confuse us fellows out in the short-grass country on the rim of the dust bowl . W. L. CUNNINGHAM . Arkansas City , Kan . There should n't really be too much confusion . Senator Byrd and Senator Douglas were talking about collectivism on a national scale ; Miss Samuel was describing a small , voluntary cooperative enterprise. ? Editor . AMENDS To THE EDITOR : In my article " A Fifth Viola 's View of the Orchestra " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a member of the Philharmonic-Symphony for more than thirty years , I am well aware that the regular membership of the orchestra is 104 players , not 112 , as written , although occasional large works do require as many musicians as the latter figure . The second concerns a characterization of Caruso . Apparently in the editing , I was caused to indicate that he " slopped over " with sentimentality . The memory of his wonderful voice and impeccable taste are far too ' vivid in my mind to allow me to imply that he stood for anything less than the greatest in the art of music . GIOVANNI DIPARATo . New York . In editing Mr. Imparato 's text , his reference to the great tenor was unfortunately dietorted. ? Mditor . RELATED To THE EDITOR : In your picture layout " People of the Week " in the issue of Jan. 1 appeared a picture of Mr. Streit and Miss Streit. a U. N. interpreter , Jeannette Streit . Is she related to " Union Now " Clarence Streit ? F. J. MURRAY . Forestville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor . V. N. MAJORITIES To THE EDITOR : Robert Gordon Menzies ' " Is the United Nations the Answer ? " seems to have ignored the main issue in his sympathetic criticism of the United Nations . That issue is best illustrated by the voting on the internationalization of Jerusalem . Here a coalition of Communist , Catholic and Arab countries outvoted such progressive nations as the United States , Britain , Uruguay , Norway and Sweden , completely disregarded the feelings of those most directly affected ? the Transjordanian and Israeli inhabitants of Jerusalem . The U. N. 's quest for peace Will fail if majorities in that body bypass the vital factors of minority rights and selfdetermination . JOSEPH A. RUEF . New York . ST . NICK ICI THE EDITOR : In June Bingham 's " Santa and the Debates Over Him Go On and On " the history of Santa Claus was omitted . St. Nicholas was Bishop of Myra in Asia Minor in the fourth century and was extremely generous , especially to children . He was so well known and loved among the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back every year on his feast day , which was instituted on Dec. 6 and still is celebrated on that date . I mention this because we so often forget that we live from the tradition of early Christianity without even knowing about it . HELENE E. FROELICHFIL Ridgewood , N. J.
