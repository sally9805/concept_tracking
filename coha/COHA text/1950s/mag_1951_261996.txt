When bustling Bill Veeck ( rhymes with deck ) barged into Cleveland in 1946 he smilingly confessed : " I 'm a publicity hound . " He lured the crowds to Municipal Stadium with boogie-woogie bands , fireworks , clowns , orchids for the ladies and baby sitters for the children . Before he sold out at a reputed profit of $600,000 in 1949 , his Cleveland Indians had broken attendance records and won their second pennant in 48 years . Last week Veeck popped back into the major-league picture again : he took over the doddering , anemic St. Louis Browns . <P> The day before he started work , ex-Marine Veeck hustled through the stands , shaking hands , signing autographs , listening to suggestions . Next night Veeck gave the crowd fireworks ( " because I like to watch them " ) and a round of free beers or Cokes , so that the fans could drink to the new management 's success . <P> But Bill Veeck knows that free beer is no substitute for good baseball . He plans to shake up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of building up his pitching staff ( he has only one first-string pitcher , Ned Garver ) by dusting off famed old ( fiftyish ) Relief Pitcher Satchel Paige ( " Satch plays better now that he 's had all his teeth pulled " ) and buying a Japanese pitcher now playing in Honolulu ( " If a ballplayer can help this club I 'll take him if he 's blue with pink spots " ) . He will sift the minor leagues for power hitters ( " This club could n't punch its way out of a paper bag with a crowbar " ) . And last week he went after Rogers Hornsby ( now managing at Seattle ) as manager . <P> Branch Rickey , a man who knows mon about baseball than Veeck does , once occupied Veeck 's present office . He left a sign on the wall : " Get the ballplayers and the rest will take care of itself . " Though the motto worked well for Rickey , Veeck does not agree with it . Says he : " You 've always got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circus . Baseball fans are like anyone else . If you buy breakfast food and it tastes like sawdust , you do n't buy any more . That 's what 's been going on here . "
