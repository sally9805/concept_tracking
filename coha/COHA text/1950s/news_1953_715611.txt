txt Strong defense of Edward Dana as general manager of the Metropolitan Transit Authority was voiced today by Frank W. Rourke , chairman of the MTA board of trustees , at a continued hearing on the trustees ' petition for fare increases which would boost the maximum fare to 20 cents . The Rourke defense came as Senator William J. Keenan ( D ) of Boston asked whether Mr. Dana should be continued in of-fice in view of the fact that deficits have mounted during his general managership of the MTA and the old Boston Ele-voted Railway . Senator Keenan asked Mr. Rourke whether in his opinion Mr. Dana is doing a good job , in the face of mount-ing deficits . Mr. Rourke replied : " He has done a good job since March . " The new board of trustees of ? which Mr. Rourke is chairman togk office in March . Shuns Inefficiency Mr. Rourke told the State = Public Utilities Commission , which is conducting the fareincrease hearing , that , " I wo n't keep anybody on the job on the MTA who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I find no evi deuce of any disloyalty up to , yet . " - Later he was asked whether he would unload any any personnel found not doing an efficient job . Mr. Rcurke said , " If I find an employee is disloyal and inefficient in any way that I can not correct , I will unload him . I will not unload a man because of rumors about him . I know whom you are gunning for , " he told Senator Keenan . " I do n't throw a man out just because I am new . " ' Earlier in answer to a direct question from Senator Mario Umana ( D ) of Boston as to whether he would resign if the fare increase is not granted , Mr. Rourke emphatically asserted , " I would not .

The MTA official answered : " We did not think so , sir . We were faced with an ever-increasing deficit . As we understand the law , we are supposed to and required to take whatever action we deem best adapted to meeting the cost of service . " Diminishing Returns Later , John M. Whouley , another member of the PUC , asked Mr. Rourke whether his board had ever considered a fare sufficient to meet the entire cost of service . Mr. Rourke replied , " No . We did not do so because we are required to set a fare which in our best judgment is adapted to meet the deficit . There is a point beyond which the law of diminishing returns will go to work . In presenting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best adapted to meet the cost of service and not reach a point where the MTA will cease to be a carrier of passengers . " David M. Brackman , chairman of the Public Utilities Commission , asked whether there was not an element of chance that the proposed increased fares will result in a loss of passengers above that estimated by the trustees and that it would be very difficult to get such passengers back on the MTA . Mr. Rourke replied , " Yes . We have got our fingers crossed . " MTA studies possibility of zone fare : Page 6.
