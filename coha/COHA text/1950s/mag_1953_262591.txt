THE MONGOL EMPIRE ( 581 pp. ) - Michael Prawdin - Macmillan ( $8 ) . <P> With Christendom embroiled in the Fifth Crusade , A.D. 1221 , heartening dis patches reached Pope Honorius III : " A new and mighty protector of Christianity has arisen . King David of India . . . has taken the field against the unbelievers . " But the Vatican 's information proved faulty ; " King David " turned out to be Genghis Khan , and his Mongol empire was to spread terror on the flank of Eu rope for the next two centuries . <P> The Mongol Empire , which tells the story of Genghis Khan and the world he made , is a splendid slice of history . First published in German in 1938 , it is the work of a Russian scholar with a flair for narrative . As it courses back &; forth across Eurasia , following the fierce Mon gol horsemen , the book reads less like a scholar 's chronicle than a majestic folk epic . <P> Hot Blood . Historian Prawdin starts his story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bound the wandering nomads of Mongolia into a military state . As Genghis Khan , chieftain of chieftains , he eventually controlled an empire that stretched from the Mediterranean to the Pacific , from the Arctic to the Himalayas . <P> Genghis Khan succeeded because he understood that an army of primitive horsemen could defeat civilized nations only if it kept complete discipline , constant mobility and immense hardihood . In his march through western Asia , after his conquest of China , he drove his troops over mountains 20,000 ft. high . The horses were accustomed to forage beneath the snow ; the men , in extremities , would open the veins of their horses , drink someof the hot blood and then close the wounds . <P> Before Genghis , the Mongols had fought helter-skelter ; he taught them the art of maneuver , of charging and wheeling in units . Like Napoleon , he promoted officers to top rank on their merits , regardless of family lineage . Instead of enslaving captives , as was Asiatic custom , he absorbed them into his fighting ranks . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city he had been told to spare , Genghis broke him to private . <P> As Historian Prawdin describes him , Genghis Khan was a ruthless but not sadistic man-a tough old nomad who did not hesitate to destroy his enemies , yet who had no interest in pointless cruelties . Conquest was in his blood ; he was never happy except on the march . " The greatest joy a man can know , " he said , " is to conquer his enemies and drive them before him . ' ' <P> After his death , no leader of equal stature arose to rule the immense , unwieldy empire . For a time , his grandson , Kublai Khan ruled in self-indulgent splendor over China , a conqueror who had been softened by the pleasures of the conquered . Legend does not exaggerate his luxury . Each of his four wives had a palace with 500 virgins as serving maids and retinues of up to 10,000 . Kublai also maintained 10,000 spotlessly white mares for the production of his favorite tipple , fermented mare 's milk ( kumiss ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet Kublai Khan was a wise ruler who brought un paralleled prosperity to China .
