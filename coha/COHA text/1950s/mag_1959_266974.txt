Her name is Maria Gabriella Giuseppa Aldegonda Adelaide Margherita Ludovica Felicita Gennara di Savoia . The founder of her house was Humbert the White-handed , who ruled Savoy in the 11th century . Among her ancestors are saints , Holy Roman and Byzantine emperors , antipopes , French and Belgian princesses , Italian and Balkan nobility and kings of lands as widely separated as Spain and Cyprus and England . Italy , last week , was in a ferment over Princess Maria Gabriella . The report was that she might marry a king twice her age whose father had been an army private . <P> Adjectival Search . In 1946 Princess Maria Gabriella , then aged six , left Italy with her father , Umberto II , who was known as " the King of May " because he had ruled only for that month , been ousted when the Italian people narrowly voted out the monarchy and voted in a republic . She was raised in exile in a seaside villa at Cascais in Portugal , and , when she was 17 , she took leave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , Queen Marie Jos , in Switzerland and attend Geneva University . <P> Called Ella by her intimates , the princess made occasional short visits to Italy , where her former subjects searched for adjectives to describe the tall ( 5 ft. 11 in. ) doe-eyed beauty who speaks five languages , rides , sings , plays the guitar , walks regally erect and smiles like a queen . " A charming princess , " raved the weekly Sttimo Giorno . " One of the loveliest girls of royal blood , " mooned Rome 's Il Messaggero . " Last summer at the pool at Gstaad , everyone agreed she had the most beautiful royal legs in Europe . " Gushed a reporter : " With those eyes and that long chestnut hair , when you call ' Ella ' the echo comes back ' bella . ' " <P> Her name was linked with Don Juan Carlos , son of the Pretender to the Spanish throne ( " He was made for her , " sighed the weekly Epoca . " Six feet tall with wavy blond hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's sportive Duke of Kent . The princess said nothing about either of the young men , went quietly back to her studies in Switzerland . <P> Pensive Thought . Another melancholy man turned up last year as a possible suitor : the hawk-nosed , greying Shah of Iran , 39 , able and conscientious , divorced from his Queen Soraya and badly needing a son for his heirless kingdom . Attracted by published pictures of Princess Ella , he went to Geneva ostensibly for dental care , was a dinner guest at the sprawling Merlinge villa where Ella lives with ex-Queen Marie Jos . After the Shah departed , the Italian press clamored so loudly that lovely Ella again visited her native land . At a press conference , after some pensive thought , she told reporters that " I do not have the harem of men attributed to me ; neither the Duke of Kent , Don Juan , nor the Shah of Iran . I have only seen the Shah once , for ten minutes . I deny reports of our engagement . " To friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough to be my father , and looks like my grandfather . " Yet -a strong point in his favor - he is one of the few kings who have a throne .
