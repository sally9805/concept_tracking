Manilal Gandhi , 58 , son of the late Mohandas Gandhi , stepped into South Africa 's tense racial controversy last week . He announced that he would fast for 14 days and would then notify Prime Minister Malan when &; where he proposed to break certain of the government 's racial laws . Said Manilal : " The Malan government 's Apartheid racial segregation policy is creeping like a fiend into every walk of life . " <P> Manilal will take only water , salt and a little bicarbonate of soda during his fast . His promised breaking of the law will probably take the form of publicly entering a " European " area and refusing to leave , thus inviting arrest . <P> His father began his political career in 1894 , when he became lawyer for a group of Indians protesting against unfair treatment by the South African government . The elder Gandhi , however , did not develop the fast ( or hunger strike ) as a publicity and political tenchnique until 1918 , after he had returned to India . No prominent Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast in 1948.
