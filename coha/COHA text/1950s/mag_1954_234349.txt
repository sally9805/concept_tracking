Casanova 's Big Night ( Paramount ) . " I 'll scream for help , " the lady protests , and no wonder . The Technicolored thing that has just waddled into her boudoir looks something like Louis XIV converted into a floor lamp . It turns out to be Bob Hope , cast as a sort of tailor 's dummy who wishes he were man enough to fill Casanova 's britches . And to the lady Hope replies ( in a long , low-slung , sports-model voice that slides up to the listener 's mental curb and honks suggestively ) : " I do n't need any help . " <P> The plain truth is that Hope ( even with Joan Fontaine ) does need help-a good bit more than he has been getting in recent pictures from his writers and directors . Despite the occasional funny moment when he can really become a floor lamp . Hope is essentially a radio comedian , a performer who is better heard than seen . <P> The humor of Hope as a balcony acrobat , for instance , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what he says than in what he does . Give him a good line and he can throw it away with the electric unconcern of a stripper discarding the semifinal spangle , but it is not much fun when there is nothing in the line worth noticing . Typical Casanova gag line : ' ' Women are like oranges . When you 've squeezed one . you 've squeezed them all . ' ' <P> Knock on Wood ( Paramount ) , like Casanova , fails to fit a famous odd peg into the rectangular hole of the screen , but it is a much more entertaining try . The trouble with Danny Kaye as a movie comedian is that his humor is almost too graphic to photograph . Give him the wide-open spaces of a theater stage and like the prairie flower , he keeps growing wilder every hour . But confine him to the camera 's cold , Technicolored eye and take away the living audience that gives him his reason for spreeing. and Kaye is not much better than his material - which is generally pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give himself more room to whirl around in . Melvin Frank and Norman Panama wrote their script - and Kaye 's talented wife Sylvia Fine contributed the specialty numbers - somewhat in the style of an aria with a few optional passages scattered along the way , at which points Danny could go into a comic Kayedenza if the inspiration came . And inspiration does come . One of the funniest parts of the picture is the scene in which Kaye . on the spur of the moment , becomes an automobile salesman sputtering trade talk ( " overhead underslung oscillating compression decravinator " ) as if his teeth were a string of firecrackers . <P> The hero this time is a ventriloquist whose twin dummies have gone berserk . Whenever one of the little monsters sees the girl his master is about to marry , he insults her . Desperate , Danny consults a psychoanalyst and promptly pratfalls in love with the psychoanalyst 's colleague ( Mai Zetterling ) . Meanwhile , he has stumbled into more serious trouble . An international spy ring has stashed the stolen plans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when two spies are killed in Danny 's hotel room , the alarm goes out for the " redheaded ripper .
