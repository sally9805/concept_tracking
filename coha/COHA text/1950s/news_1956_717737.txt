Not Be Panicked ' by Moscow 's Strategy in Wooing Needy Lands The text of Dulles address is printed Qn Page 6 . By WILLIAM G. WEART Special to The New York Times . PHILADELPHIA , Feb. 26 ? Secretary of State Dulles declared today there was no need - to be " panicked " by the new Soviet economic strategy to " subvert and communize the nations that are its targets . " But , he emphasized , the United States Government should have authority to commit $100,000,000 a year for several years for longrange projects to develop the economic well-being of the lessdeveloped countries of the free world . " Without that limited , longrange authority , " he insisted , " we take a risk which is quite unjustified , having regard to the small cost of avoiding In the past , Congressional leaders have opposed committing the country to such long-range foreign aid projects , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke at the eighth Sunday session of the tenth annual Philadelphia Bulletin Forum in historic Congress Hall at Independence Square .

Senate , Democrats contend the Soviet world position has advanced and that of the United States has deteriorated . Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last Friday , Mr. Dulles testified that the Russians had had to revise and replace a bankrupt strategy and that the United States position was better than a year ago . " This year , " Mr. Dulles said , " we are asking Congress to appropriate for next year 's economic program $100,000,000 more than is available for this year .

" The Russians have shifted their policy , he said , because open Communist aggression ? has been checked " by the cohesion , resolution , vigilance and strength of the free nations . " " Let us never forget that this is what deflected the Soviet rulers from primary reliance upon - violence to which they were dedicated by creed and which they are skilled to prac ? tice , " Mr. Dulles emphasized . " They came up against the granite-of a declared and strong // resolve . If that granite should turn to putty , then violence and threat of war could again ? becoMe the order ' of the day , " he asserted . " Meanwhile , we have new problems , " he continued . " These will require new efforts , without relaxation of the old cohesion , resolution , vigilance and strength .

He said the industrial nations of the West can and must provide such an alternative . Therefore , he said , this country will move forward with sound policies to aid the economic progress of less-developed nations , Normally , Mr. Dulles observed , this could be accomplished by private capital , but the risks , in much of the world , are such that a substantial part must be provided on a public basis in order to spread the risk . This is one of the purposes of the United States mutual security program , now in its eighth year , he said in pointing out that the economic part of that pro- : gram amounts to about $1,700 , - 000,000 for the year ending June 30 . About $600,000,000 of the total , he said , will assist by loan or grant in capital developments in other lands . Someday , he said , there may be a different Russia .

" Yet , he said , the United States does not assume " fatalistically " that there can be no evolution within the Soviet Union or that its rulers will always be predatory . The basic policy of this country , he said , is to advance the day when the Soviet Union will be governed by men who put the welfare of their people ahead of world conquest .
