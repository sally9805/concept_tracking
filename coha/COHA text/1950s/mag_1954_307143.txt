Now that EDC is dead , the only living nucleus of a supranational Europe is the six-nation European Coal and Steel Community , which has its own High Authority , its own supreme court , even its own Common Assembly . Last week the 78 delegates to the Assembly unanimously elected a new Assembly president : economist Giuseppe Pella , former Christian Democratic Premier of Italy ( for 4 months in 1953 ) . He is the third ex-Premier to be chosen for the post ( predecessors : Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak and Italy 's late Alcide de Gasperi ) . <P> Still to be chosen : a successor to Jean Monnet as operational head of the Coal and Steel Authority . One favorite for the job : Robert Schuman , whose " Schuman Plan " started it all . Though politically the European dream stirs no great enthusiasm these days , the economic side of it is surprisingly perky . Largely as a result of the Schuman Plan , and its creation of a common tariff-free market , Jean Monnet reported last week that : <P> Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 75% since 1952 . <P> Steel prices , which skyrocketed in some cases from $50 to $150 per ton during the Korean war , have stabilized at some $75 per ton . <P> European steel manufacturers have orders on hand to keep them busy until the end of 1955.
