To no one 's surprise , the first name mentioned at President Eisenhower 's press conference last week was " Senator Taft . " As soon as Eisenhower had finished a few preliminary remarks , United Press 's Merriman Smith popped everybody 's question : " Do you share Senator Taft 's view that we should forget the United Nations so far as the Korean war is concerned ? " <P> The President shot back an emphatic " No ! " He paused to take breath while the single word sank home . Then , with apologies for being " just a bit verbose , " he launched into an even-tempered , carefully considered answer . <P> Compromises for Free Men . " If you are going to go it alone one place , " said he , " You of course have to go it alone everywhere . If you are going to try to develop a coalition of understanding based upon decency , on ideas of justice , common concepts of governments , established by the will of free men , then you have got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between the conflicting partisan considerations that will serve the best good of all . <P> " Now , that is what we are up against today , because our whole policy is based on this theory : no single free nation can live alone in the world . We have to have friends . Those friends have got to be tied to you in some form or another . We have to have that unity in basic purposes that comes from a recognition of common interests . That is what we are up against . " <P> Barb for Hecklers . Then , in words which seemed to combine a tolerance for Taft with a special barb for U.S. hecklers in Britain , the President continued : " Now , not being a particularly patient man , I share the irritations and the sense of frustration that comes to everybody who is working for what he believes to be a decent purpose and finds himself balked by what he thinks is the ignorance , or the errors , of someone who is otherwise his friend . " He could well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times when we knew we were trying to do right and we got slapped in the face . <P> " I understand those things , but I will tell you , only patience , only determination , only optimism and only a very deep faith can carry America forward . " <P> For his answer to Taft the President relaxed press conference rules to permit direct quotation . For the rest of the conference , he reverted to the time-honored paraphrase . Other questions and answers , in essence , made these points : <P> Q. Should the U.S. oppose Communist China 's admission to the U.N. ? <P> A. Red China should not be admitted under the conditions and circumstances that now exist , believing , as we do , that Red China is subservient to Moscow . <P> Q. What about the Senate Appropriations Committee vote to cancel U.S. funds for the U.N . if Red China is admitted ? <P> A. They propose a very , very drastic sort of cure for something the President would consider a very grave error . He needed time to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below what the Joint Chiefs individually believe necessary for the security of the U.S. ?
