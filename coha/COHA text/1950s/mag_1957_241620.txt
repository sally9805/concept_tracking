TKE COURT AND THE CASTLE ( 319 pp. ) - Rebecca West-Yale University ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> In Yugoslavia . Rebecca West once invited a professor who lived in a smaller town to come to Belgrade . He declined , saying : " Thank you very much , but I am like Hamlet . I want very much to go to Belgrade , but I can not make up my mind . " Most Shakespearean producers , critics and audiences have agreed with this point of view , complains Author West . Hamlet , they say , is the most fascinating of plays-and Hamlet the most irresolute of princes . But , Author West suggests , how about taking another look at Shakespeare 's text ? Instead of seeming an ambivalent neurotic with a pure heart , does the sweet prince not really emerge as a tough , virile " Renaissance man " who stops at nothing ? <P> Hamlet kills three men ( Claudius , Polonius and Laertes ) with his own hand . After stabbing Polonius in his mother 's presence , Hamlet says briskly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , " and cracks a joke about the corpse starting to stink in a month or so . Far from feeling queasy in matters of life and death , Hamlet shows repeatedly that he is coldly vindictive and diabolically foresighted . He not only sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to England with a sealed letter containing their own death warrants , but urges England 's king to bump them off without warning-so that they can not be shriven by a priest and will surely go to hell . <P> Unpleasant Revelation . Why , asks Author West , has the world so falsified the character of Hamlet ? " If a work of art should make a revelation which discredits what most human beings wish to believe , " she writes , " they pretend that the author wrote something quite other than what he did . " The world , she theorizes , would rather not swallow the " revelation " contained in Hamlet . <P> The nature of that revelation is the theme of The Court and the Castle , 16 literary essays based on Rebecca West 's Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Turgenev , who said : " There is not one of us but recognizes in the prince . . . our own characteristics . " But the characteristics that men really recognize are neither noble aspirations nor irresoluteness : men see , in fact , their own traits of taint and corruption . Hamlet is stamped with Original Sin . Hamlet can not be " pure " - nor can mankind . This is the message that people have managed to ignore for three centuries , because they have found it too unpleasant . <P> The king and court of Shakespeare 's Elsinore , argues Author West , represent all governments , all men . Nobody has clean hands . Ophelia is usually presented on the stage as a convent-type sweetie who has a nervous breakdown ; in fact she is just " a disreputable young woman , " a docile pawn in her father 's plot to match her with Eligible Bachelor Hamlet . " No line in the play suggests that she felt either passion or affection for him . " Even the ghost of Hamlet 's father is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the past , of tradition-and man 's past is no cleaner than his present . Thus Hamlet , like every man , is in a hopeless plight : stab and kill as he may , he will never be able to right man 's original wrong . <P>
