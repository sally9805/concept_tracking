txt William N. Oatis , former Associated Press correspondent in Prague , said on his return here yesterday that he " certainly " had violated the espionage laws of Czechoslovakia . However , Mr. Oatis , who was pardoned last Friday after having served twentytwo months of a ten-year sentence on charges of espionage , declared that any correspondent operating under United States standards of journalism inevitably would have risked the same violations and the same penalty , ' The law In question dealt with the " receiving " of certain economic , political and military information , and its breach was considered the more serious , Mr. Oatis explained , if the information had been " received " for the purpose of transmission to a foreign government . He said that at the beginning of his assignment to Prague ; in June , 1950 , he had not in " most cases " realized he was breaking the law , but that when the law was read to him in the course of the first week of his interrogation , following his arrest on April 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At New York International Airport , where he was reunited with his wife , Laurabelle , Mr. Oatis , his voice weak but his stand remarkably firm in the face of a barrage of difficult questions , consistently declined to discuss his relations with the United States Embassy in Prague prior to his arrest . Unanswered Questions He would not say whether he had transmitted any information to the embassy , nor would he answer directly a question as to whether he ever had worked , with or without pay , for the State Department or any other agency of the United States Government . " That 's the kind of thing I 'm not going to say anything about , " he declared . When it was suggested that some of his answers might appear puzzling and perhaps embarrassing , he said quietly , " I realize I 'm , in an embarrassing position and I 'll continue to be . " A little later , Frank J. Starzel , general manager of The Associated Press , interrupted the press conference to say : " Before , during and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete confidence in his integrity as a news man . I want to ask that his reluctance to discuss certain questions not be unfairly used as implying anything . " The general impression seemed to be that Mr. Oatis was trying painfully , stubbornly , to convey his honesty , but that there were certain phases of his situation that he did not yet feel himself free to talk about . At no time during the hour-long interview did he lose his patience , his poise or his sense of humor .. Only his constantly dropping voice betrayed his deep fatigue . Mr. Starzel went on to declare : " I wish you to bear in mind ' that for more than two years Bill has been cut off from all normal contacts , serving a prison sentence ! in a foreign jaiL He has had no I opportunity , as you gentlemen lhave , to background himself about the case . Only seventy-two hours ago he learned of his release.i ! Since then he has traveled halflway around the world and has ! faced a barrage of questions like ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Iman would have the gravest difficulty in collecting his thoughts ! and answering intelligently . I would hesitate to speak of details myself without consulting the record , although I have been closely concerned with this case for two years . " At this , Mr. Oatis turned to his I c/lief with obvious gratitude . " Mr. Starzel , I consider that you made a very fair statement , " he , Said , " and I want to thank you for it . " The frail-looking 39-year-old native of Marion , Ind. , was wearing the blue suit in which he had stood trial when , with his wife , he emerged from the airplane door at 1:35 P. M. The plane had landed at 1 o'clock and Mrs. Oatis , with Mr. Starzel , had gone aboard at 1:20 . Thomas J. Cory , a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations , was the only State Department man present , but he did not enter the ' plane , nor did he remain - for the interviews . He said he had been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to the effect that since Mr. Dulles had met Mrs. Oatis in Washington , he had taken a personal:interest in the case , and that he rejoiced with her in her husband 's release . Mr. Cory delivered the message while Mrs. Oatis was waiting for the plane to discharge its other passengers . Through a. crush of Bronx school children , and of Americans of Czechoslovak origin , some in native dress , the couple was directed to a cluster of about fifteen microphones . The brim . of Mr. Oatis ' brown hat had been pushed up ; a razor scratch showed under his left ear . A newsreel man asked if he considered that having done his job constituted espionage ? and the questioner seemed taken aback by the reply . ' Certainly Violations ' " Under the law certain things I did were certainly violations of the law , " he said , going on to explain that journalism , as practiced in the West , was " certainly espionage " in Czechoslovakia . " But from the American point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that you had committed a crime ? " " That question would not arise , " Mr. Oatis replied firmly , " because ' I was not in America . I was in Czechoslovakia and I wish people would appreciate that . " After a session with the still photographers , Mr. Oatis , flanked by his wife , Mr. Starzel and Alan J. Gould , executive editor of The Associated Press , who had flown'with him from Germany , was ready for the press conference . It began on the matter of whether he ever had worked for the United ' States Government . When he said he could not discuss this , the query was put even more pointedly : Had he , officially or otherwise , served the State Department or any other Government agency while in Prague ? " 1 ca n't answer it in that form , " Mr. Oatis persisted . " That 's a big ! negotiation " ? . His voice dropped , and after a few words with Mr. Starzel , he took a fresh start : " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? * The situation is very complicated and it has to be put at considerable length . * * For one thing , it is n't organized yet in my own mind . " He was asked if he had been doing anything beyond the- ordinary duties of any foreign correspondent . " Better take a look at the record of the trial , " he replied . " I 'm letting the record speak for itself . " Another questioner asked if that meant that the record was to be accepted as it stood . " Until I can see what the record is , I want to let it stand , " he said . Whenever the phrase " by American standards " was used , Mr. Oatis reiterated : " It 's not a question of American standards . I was in Czechoslovakia . " Did he plan to repudiate his " confession " ? " I 'm studying all this business , " he said wearily . He spoke about the espionage law as he recalled it . He pointed out that the " higher level " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign government , and that on this level the penalty ranged up to death . Did You Receive " Did you receive such economic , political and military information ? " he was asked . Oatis ' words came quickly . " You 're a reporter , " he said . " Do you gather political , Military and economic information ? I did too ! " Another man , trying to be gentle , asked : " But did you receive such information on that socalled higher level , that is for transmission to the United States Government ? " " I 'm not going to go into that , " said Mr. Oatis , calmly . " Were you given any drugs ? " " Yes ? I got TB and they gave me forty pills a day until I got well . " He said he also had received about ten injections of what he was told were sugar solution and whether the Information he might have gathered would have differed ) from what , the United States Embessy might have had access to I on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position I to talk about what the American Embassy can do , " he said . Later , I ' harassed by a similar question , he snapped , " Do you realize what's1 happening to the American embassies in some of these countries ? " He was smiling again , however , when asked II he had - brought back any- souvenirs . He said The Associated Press bureau in Amsterdam had given him a box of candy en route . Then someone wanted to know if any ' foreign correspondent could work in Prague according to United States journalistic standards without getting in trouble with the law . " It 's a matter of accident , " he said . " They might go ahead and let him work forever . It all depends on how far he went . If he 'd confine himself to official sources , he 'd probably not be arrested . " Criticism Resented by Czechs ** said that while.he had not briefed himself thoroughly on the espionage law , he sensed early that the Communists were resentful of incoming news they felt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to " knock down " such material . For example , he once asked an offical about a Western report that the Russians had taken control of the Czech uranium mines at Jachymov , in the north . " If I were to ask a question like , that in Washington , I 'd be in jail the next day , " he said the Czech told him . But did he feel ' he had been arrested for what would be a crime here ? " I hope it would n't be a crime here , " Mr. Oatis laughed . " I have n't read the law lately . " No other Western correspondent has been stationed in Prague since May , 1950 , when THE NEW YORK TIMES correspondent fled the country on learning that he was to be arrested on " espionage " charges , and he was followed out within a few days by the correspondents of The United Press and Reuters . - Mr. Oatis said he had no idea of his plans . He was more tired than ever when he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 39  --  and many of his older colleagues wondered if , as a reporter , he himself ever had shared in so relentless a. questioning of a news source . When a Czech-American asked if he had a " statement " to " aim " at the people of Czechoslovakia , he said lightly : " I 'm not aiming statements at anyone . This is off the cuff . " And it obviously was .
