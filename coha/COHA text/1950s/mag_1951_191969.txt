Given the proposition that there is no standout horse in next week 's Kentucky Derby , 44,230 people went looking for a likely bet in the Wood Memorial at Jamaica last week . They came away shaking their heads after UNCLE MILTIE , the favorite , finished eighth. * <P> Battlefield , last year 's money-winning-est two-year-old , had already been declared out of the Derby . ROUGH ' N TUMBLE , the California champion , was on the shelf with splints . Greentree 's well-liked BIG STRETCH had been publicly embarrassed in a Keeneland prep when an upstart named RUHE gave him a three-length beating . Out in Nevada , some legalized handbook players were still contemplating the 30-to-1 odds offered against the chances of BILL BAILEY , a horse that died last month in Hot Springs , Arkansas . <P> The air was no clearer in New York , where 13 three-year-olds showed up for the 27th running of the mile-and-a-six-teenth Wood , the East 's final Derby test . Despite the fact that he practically trains himself , had apparently reached his peak a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same field the previous week , UNCLE MIL TIE , was backed into even-money favoritism . Neglected at 13-to-2 was REPETOIRE , a game chestnut colt with a misspelled name who was not bred to run very far , but has managed to win all four of his 1951 starts . <P> Jockey Pete McLean broke REPETOIRE forwardly , but elected to move up gradually while racing out of harm 's way on the outside . Turning into the stretch , he made his run at the front horse , INTENT , a 9-to-1 shot . REPETOIRE was forced wide as the leader bore out , recovered and had enough left to beat late-rushing BATTLE MORN ( 10-to-1 ) by a head in a modest 1:44 ? Third was INTENT , running only the third race of his career and possibly a comer . <P> Would REPETOIRE go on to win at Churchill Downs ? Views varied in the Jamaica paddock . Said Jockey McLean : " Four races , four wins-why not ? " Said one veteran horseman : " BATTLE MORN lost a lot of ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them dogs can run a lick . To me they looked like the field for the Charlestown Derby . " <P> <P> *This week UNCLE MILTIE 'S owner began to suspect that a rest might do the colt more good than a trip to Kentucky .
