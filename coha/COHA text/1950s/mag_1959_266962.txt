As the Republican National Committee plowed into Des Moines through six-inch snows and below-zero temperatures for an election post-mortem last week , the weather matched the mood of National Chairman Meade Alcorn . Ever since Democrats clobbered the Republicans at the polls , Alcorn has been picking apart November 's returns for a clue to what happened to the G.O.P. His report : " Our party has suffered a humiliating defeat . We took a bad beating . There are no alibis - but there are reasons . " <P> One reason : strong opposition . " We are being outvoted , outtalked , outspent and outworked by an alert , disciplined , politically astute opposition . " Another reason , which rang jarringly in conservative ears : " We must get rid of the right-to-work tag pinned on our coattails . " Still another : the Democrat-labor alliance . " Organized labor was able to put in one state Maine in behalf of opposition candidates more field men than the Republican Party had available nationally . " <P> Losing the Anchor . Alcorn called on a research analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of charts to point up still other causes . For one , the party is losing the flourishing white-collar voters who should be its anchor ; 52% voted Republican in 1954 , 38% in 1958 . And it is losing its appeal to youth and becoming the party of the older voter . In November Republicans got 49% of the age-50-and-over vote , 37% of the age-49-and-under . <P> The 101 committeemen and women present welcomed Alcorn 's carefully drawn nine-point reorganizing program - two million more precinct workers , year-long fund-raising campaigns , more emphasis on college-age voters and teenagers , etc . But when it came to the philosophy that the remodeled machine should push , conservatives were less than enthusiastic . And they had the meeting 's stronger voices . <P> Paging the President . One of the loudest was Pennsylvania 's tariff-championing Congressman Richard M. Simpson , whose key advice to candidates as congressional campaign chairman last fall had been to ignore the White House . Pressed to get back to his work in Congress , Simpson arranged to get on the program right after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike : POLITICAL ACTIVITY MUST BE A MATTER OF UNREMITTING EFFORT . IT MUST GO ON 365 <P> DAYS A YEAR . Boomed Simpson , when he took the floor : " I 'm encouraged . The President used the words ' make unremitting effort ' of a political nature . We 've been doing that for a long time . I call upon the White House to give us some of that unremitting political planned effort . " He got heavier applause than the President . <P> Next day the meeting heard from the new Senate campaign chairman , Arizona 's right-wing Barry Goldwater . Goldwater had flown out from Washington , been weathered in at Chicago , wired an urgent message . Alcorn 's strategies , he said , are <P> MECHANICALLY O.K. , BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IS MISSING . WHERE DOES THE PARTY STAND ; WHAT ARE ITS PRINCIPLES ? Goldwater knew what the principles ought to be : LET THE PARTY DECLARE AGAINST CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT . . . LET THE PARTY QUIT COPYING THE NEW DEAL , SEEKING ONLY FOR VOTES .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
