THE NATION indorses Adlai E. Stevenson for Presi- dent of the United States . We do so without concealing or minimizing our differences with him and the Democratic Party on several important issues : We do so because , after weighing soberly the policies and practices of both parties and candidates , we believe the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower - would be a disaster for the country and perhaps for the world . The facts on which we have based our decision are given in detail in a special section of this issue ? What You Lose if Eisenhower Wins . That any liberal who reads those facts will fail to arrive at the same conclusion we can not believe . Our chief difference with Governor Stevenson is on his handling of the issue of communism . As we pointed out last week , he seems to us to be exaggerating both the danger of communism in America and the measures required to deal with it . In his Detroit speech on October 7 , he defended the Smith act , approved putting Communist leaders " behind bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pointed with satisfaction to the 1,500 federal employees ousted for " doubtful loyalty . " In our Opinion this wholesale indorsement of the government 's internal-security program was an unfortunate concession to current hysteria , and we believe it will only strengthen the hand of the McCarthy fanatics . The Nation is opposed to communism . We have no doubt that there are spies working for the Soviet government in this country . We believe they should be ferreted out and punished by legal methods . But we are in complete disagreement with the idea that communism as a doctrine-or Communists as such constitute a serious threat to our form of government and our way of life . Those who hold this idea  --  among them the Republican candidate and his backers  --  betray a basic lack of confidence in the democratic system . In our view communism is an anachronism in America . It offers no threat to a highly industrialized , h'ghly productive economy like our own so long as that economy functions effectively to provide a decent standard of living , and so long as individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in countries whose people are struggling under the burden of poverty , ignorance , and oppression that communism exercises an understandable appeal . We are disappointed , as we have said , that Governor Stevenson failed to deal with - the Communist issue in these terms . In spite- of this we have confidence in his essential democracy and liberalism , his passionate love for America , his concern for human freedom . We are deeply impressed by his personal integrity , his willingness to take positions contrary to those held by important groups of potential supporters . We share his belief that government can and must serve the people , and we trust his assurance that the best features of the New and Fair eals will be continued and improved . GENERAL EISENHOWER is today the willing spokesman of big business and the most reactionary elements in the Republican Party . We have been astonished , as well as horrified , by his readiness to accept these groups , abandoning the more liberal leaders who fought and won the battle for his nomination at Chicago . We have been shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenne ; and by his cool repudiation of national policies which he helped to shape during and after the war . Today Eisenhower has behind him the concentrated economic , financial , and industrial power of the country . His candidacy has unified American reaction , North and South , East and West . His following embraces the " angry right " of the Republican Party , which he was supposed to have routed at the Chicago convention , the Dixiecrats , and beyond these the semi-fascist rabble to whom McCarthy and MacArthur are heroes . We no longer have any doubt that an Eisenhower victory would endanger the social gains of the last twenty-five years and slam the door on further reform ; that it would intensify the drive against civil liberties , greatly strengthen the military  --  big business influence in govern , ment , and increase the power of the Dixiecrats . In other countries his victory would be taken as an indication that the United States had ruled out the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the cold war . Indeed , Eisenhower 's pronouncements on foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " Asians against Asians " ? have already been interpreted abroad in this sense . A recent editorial comment in the London Tribune on the liberation proposal was echoed with greater or less vehemence in many journals : The policy in fact is one of a general crusade against communism to be waged without end until thi doctrine of government is confined - to the borders of Russia itself . Why the crusade should stop at this point is not so clear . The case for destroying communism in Russia should surely be no less strong than the case for destroying it in China . However , the lapse of logic is merely an illustration of the criminal insanity which underlies the whole program . The plain fact is that General Eisenhower is outlining a policy to which he 355 knows no Russian government could possibly give its acceptance . He thus rules out any faint possibility of negotiation and invites us to a conquest , as the Russians would see it , more forinidable by far than anything which ever filled the mind of man before . GOVERNOR STEVENSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Russians should be based on strength , has firmly advocated making every effort to achieve peaceful coexistence : Coexistence is not a form of passive acceptance of things as they are . It is waging a contest between freedom and tyranny by peaceful means . It will involve negotiation and adjustment  --  compromise but not appeasement  --  and I will never shrink from these if they would advance the world toward a secure peace . He has denounced the suggestion that we shoUld instigate civil war in satellite countries , characterizing this idea as " dangerous , red less , foolish . . . and likely to lead to the sacrifice of the lives of the very people whom we hope to liberate . " He has said : " We must never dose our minds or rrAP7P nur positions . We must strive constantly to break the deadlock in our atomic discussions . " ? Governor Stevenson offers the country a constructive domestic policy geared to the concept of improving the standard of living of all groups in our community . He offers the world a foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy can be secured only by rescuing from ignorance and misery the masses of humanity now involved in a great revolutionary ferment . These positions are more , we believe , than mere campaign promises . The token of their good faith is SteVenson 's own record and the achievements of the Democratic Party under Roosevelt and Truman . The Republican record is one of opposition to every progressive policy at home and abroad . The leaders chiefly responsible for that record are the men who control the mind and policies of Eisenhower . This year , According to recent polls , independent voters form at leash half of the electorate ; more than in any previous election they will determine the outcome . Be " cause of this the independent voter carries an immense and unprecedented responsibility . The Nation 's readers are almost without exception both liberal and independent . They vote not according to party labels but according to their best judgment as to candidates and issues . - To all-of them we say : failure to recognize that there is a clear choice between Eisenhower and Stevenson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elect Stevenson is the only possible choice for the independent voter . WHAT YOU LOSE IF EISENHOWER WINS The Republican Record Exposed Who Wins with Ike ? Is this a temporary retreat , typical of all political campaigns , that can be reversed once the election is over and Ike has won ? No . If Ike wins , the Old Guard in the Republican Party will hold the positions of power . Unschooled in civilian affairs , Ike , more than most Presidents , will be dependent upon Congress . In a Republican Congress the dominant figure will be Senator Taft  --  head of the Republican Party 's Policy Committee , arch-isolationist , the man who voted against the Marshall Plan , the Mutual Security Program , Point Four , wage-an.deprice controls ; joint author of the Taft-Hartley act ; a Senator who puts economy above security and has opposed virtually every measure to improve the living standard of the American people . It is the - Taft ? Old Guard program that Eisenhower is offering as his formula for victory . Is it likely that he can or will discard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind Ike That Ike should have capitulated to Taft and McCarthy , that he should have embraced Cain and Jenner and all the Republican " dinosaurs , " is not surprising if one examines his sponsors . Not a single important section of industrial power is behind Stevenson . Behind Eisenhower stand the chief banking , oil , steel , rubber , coal , and chemical interests , the private utilities , the armament industry , the automobile , electric-products , and food industries . The plan to make Eisenhower President was formulated in 1945 by four of the most powerful dynasties in this country  --  the Rockefellers , Mellons , Morgans , and du Pouts . These four families have direct assets of over five billion dollars . They have immediate access to assets of over fifty billion . The real " brain trust " behind Dwight D. Eisenhower , representing these interests , consists of three men ? Winthrop Aldrich , chairman of the Chase National Bank ; Thomas J. Parkinson , president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society ; and Thomas J. Watson , chairman of International Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arranged that the presidency of that institution be offered to Eisenhower as his Introduction into civilian life and as the first step in grooming him for the Presidency of the United States . In July , 1952 , the du Pont interests , which had strongly favored Robert A. Taft for President , were won over to Eisenhower 's candidacy by the appoint-ment of Aithur E. Summerfield as chairman of the Republican National Committee . Mr. Summerfield is one of the largest automobile dealers in the country and through ' his Chevrolet agency is linked closely to General Motors , controlled by the du Pouts . ARE YOU an Industrial worker , a white-collar worker , a farmer , a small business man , a professional , a member of a minority group ? Whoever you are , this is what you have to lose if Eisenhower wins : A fair chance for peace , an economy geared to the needs of the ordinary citizen , relief from inflation , equitable distribution of taxes , public development of natural resources in the public interest , the return to-an America free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record and judge for yourself . Are You an Industrial Worker ? If you are , - you know that since 1932 , under the New Deal and Fair Deal , labor 's average wage has risen 90 per cent , while the average number of hours worked has decreased . Time and a half for overtime is accepted practice ; paid holidays and vacations are provided by many employers . These gains were obtained by the workers themselves acting through their unions . But their right to organize freely and to bargain collectively was given great impetus in 1933 , when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office , and again in 1935 when the Wagner act was passed . Progress continued under successive Democratic administrations ' which recognized that greater well-being for workers meant greater well-being for the country . In 1947 a major blow at the rights of labor was struck by the Taft-Hartley law , sponsored by Senator Taft and Representative Fred Hartley , both Republicans . President Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley bill , but the Republican majority overrode his veto . The nature of the law is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the National Association of Manufacturers spent $3,600,000 trying to sell it to the American public . Taft-Hartley is an attempt to hobble free labor unions . It gives the employer the power to prevent mass picketing , the power to enforce the open shop , the power to destroy union treasuries by damage claims . It imposes upon union leaders the infamous loyalty oath which no enemy of America would refuse to take and no loyal American needs to take . It has prevented hundreds of thousands of workers from improving their lot through unionization . In the five years before the Taft-Hartley act was passed , the labor force was increased by 900,000 persons and union Membership by 5,000,000 . Since 2947 the labor force has increased by 4,500,000 persons , but unions have gained only 800,000 new members . Under the law , fines and damage suits have cost the United Mine Workers $5,470,000 , the A. F. of L. Building Trades Department $2,000,000 , the International Typographical Union of the A. F. of L. $11,000,000 . Thirty damage Suits totaling $30,000,000 have been brought against the Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunctions and-two thousand contempt charges have been piled on members of the union . The United Packinghouse Workers face a $2,756,000 damage suit brought by Armour and Company . The International Longshoremen and Warehousemen 's Union was fined $750,000 for picketing the Juneau Spruce Company of Alaska in a dispute with the International Woodworkers in 1950 . The National Association of Marine Cooks and Stewards has paid $65,000 worth of penalties in employers ' suits since the Taft-Hartley law was passed . The United Automobile Workers in Indiana is being sued for $190,000 in damages , the New York Teamsters for $3,000,000 . The obvious intent of these actions is to deplete union treasuries , weaken organization , and reduce benefits to union members . The 1952 Republican platform favors the retention ' of the Taft-Hartley act , though Eisenhower has said he wants some amendments to it . Contrast this with the Democratic platform 's opposition to the law and the outspoken demand for its repeal by Governor Stevenson . If Ike and his crew win , Robert A. Taft , principal author of the Taft-Hartley act , would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all labor legislation . October 18 , 1952 Civil Liberties , inane Professional , and the ; ' ' ublik If you are a lawyer , teacher , writer , minister , librarian , actor , artist , doctor , then your whole future depends upon the outcome of this election . For you must have freedom of thought , association , speech , and action in order to function . Upon your freedom depends the society of the future . Goebbels taught the world the value of the big lie . He also taught the world how to destroy opposition by shackling the freedom of the leadership groups . These techniques have already appeared on the American scene . The requirement of loyalty oaths is spreading thrOugh the professions . Book purges are frequent . The pressure of economic boycott has virtually regimented the entertainment industry and has invaded the teaching and scientific worlds . Fear of economic and social ostracism is creating a society of informers . Black and gray lists and private Gestapos are a commonplace . Trial by slander and insinuation is replacing due process under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first attacked ; but the intention is to strike at every sector of the community . Carried to its logical conclusion , this campaign would make the America of tomorrow just another totalitarian country in which one must think and act as the ruling clique orders . Who is responsible for the attempt to impose regimentation on America ? John E. Rankin , the Democratic reactionary from Mississippi , gave it its real start in 1945 ; when he succeeded in winning permanent life for the House Un-American Activities Committee . The measure was passed by the votes of 137 Republicans and 70 Democrats , 63 of whom were from the South . The " success " of the House Un-American Activities Committee in destroying reputations , undermining , constitutional safeguards , and wrecking careers encouraged the greatest attempt yet made to destroy the very foundatiOns of American democracy . The present leader of this undertaking is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy . Since 1949 he has based his career on making repeated , unproved , and slanderous charges that our government , and particularly the Department of State , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unjust acts under the federal loyalty program , the most serious attack on civil liberties has been the work of the RepublicanDixiecrat congressional coalition . The go-ahead signal for McCarthy came from Senator Taft , chairman , of the Republican Policy Committee . It was Taft who provided McCarthy as a keynoter for the Republican convention . It was Taft and his associates who brought about Eisenhower 's indorse : meat of McCarthy  --  of the man who called Secretary of Defense Marshall " a man steeped in falsehood . " Eisenhower owed his selection as Supreme Commander to General Marshall . Speaking in Appleton , . Wisconsin , where he was introduced by McCarthy , Eisenhower urged McCarthy 's reelection on the ground that the Wisconsin Senator and he saw eye to eye on the need " of ridding this government of the incompetents , the dishonest , and , above all , the subversive and disloyal , " and that they differed only as to " methods. ? Would Eisenhower repudiate McCarthy once both had won ? It is hardly likely . If the Republicans gain control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Government Expenditure  --  with the power to investigate every government department . If Eisenhower wins , McCarthyism will be not only respectable but the measuring rod of American practice . And perhaps the last opportunity to win the fight for constitutional freedoms will have vanished . ? Are You a Farmer ? The struggle of the American farmer against poverty is an epic one . In the twenty years since 1932 the farmer has made marked progress toward achieving a fair living standard , thanks to price supports and marketing clearances . The government has also been of incalculable aid in showing farmers how to conserve the soil , achieve farm ownership , , benefit from research , get credit at reasonable rates , instal electricity and telephones . Farm output has risen 75 per cent since 1932 . Ten billion dollars has been added to the farmers ' gross income  --  an increase of nearly one-third . In 1951 the average farmer 's net income was $2,800 , not large but almost ten times what he earned in 1932 . Three-fourths of the farmers own their own farms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration ? The Republican Party platform makes a series of promises to the farmer . Now do promise and performance compare ? The record of the Republican Party is a clear contradiction of the pledges of its principal candidate and of its own equivocal platform . The Republican Eightieth Congiess ( 1947-48 ) proved Its true intentions by cutting the number of commodities to be supported , reducing price Boors and commodity loans , and limiting the ability of the Commodity Credit Corporation to acquire new storage facilities . Since 1948 the Democratic leadership has succeeded in putting price supports back at 90 per cent of parity through 1954 , and has increased the borrowing capacity of the C. C. C. by two billion dollars . This in the face of Republican opposition . In 1950 all the Senate Republicans tad 56 per cent of the House Republicans voted against raising the borrowing power of the C. C. C. by that amount to insure an adequate loan program . In 1952 , 53 per cent of the House Republicans voted against straight 90 per cent of parity price supports . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil-conservation funds froth $280,000,000 to $150 , - 000,000 , thus maintaining their - consistent opposition to the Soil Erosion Act , which was passed in 1935 over Republican opposition . In 1947 , 82 per cent of the - Republican Senators voted against conservation payments to farmers . In 1948 , 93 per cent opposed appropriations for soil-conservation payments . In 1951 , 80 per cent voted against the soil-conservation program in its entirety . Although the Republican Party now urges the development of rural electrification and communication , it has consistently opposed this ever since 1943 . In 1943 , 73 per cent- of the House Republicans voted against adequate funds for rural electrification , funds intended to expand transmission lines and to service additional areas . Three years later 40 per cent of the Senate Republicans voted against funds for constructkg public electric-generating plants . In 1947 the Republicans tried to cripple the Rural Electrification Administration by slashing appropriations . In 1951 , 86 per cent of the House Republicans voted for an amendment which , had it passed , would have turned over the control of publicly developed power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. A. , but to the power interests . The era of agricultural surpluses is gone . To meet the growing food needs of a growing population ( 5,840 more tons of food per day were required in 1952 than In 1951 ) , the fertility of the soil and the productivity of the farmer must be raised to the highest possible level . Yet as recently as July , 1951 , three-fourths of the Senate Republicans voted to slash funds for getting news of research progress to farmers , even though this knowledge meant millions of dollars of savings to the farmer and to the consumer . The Choice for the Small Business Man There are four million independent business men in the United States today . Like the farmers , they have improved their lot , thanks in part to the policies of a friendly Administration . The Republican platform promises to aid small business in every practical way . " But the Republican record shows that its primary interest is the protection of big business . In 1947 , for example , 91 per cent of the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-monopoly enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission . Again , in 1947 , 93 per cent of the Senate Republicans voted to exempt railroads from the anti-trust laws and overrode President Truman 's veto of this exemption . The small business man has been helped since 1947 by some $576,000,000 worth of loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , 99 per cent of which were repaid . In the last session of Congress , Republican leaders tried to abolish the R. F. C. If the Republicans come to power , the bankers will probably win their fight to raise interest rates , and as a result small business can be pushed to the wall . This despite the fact that in the five-year period of 1943-50 bank profits after taxes rose more than 60 per cent . Winthrop Aldrich , chairman of the board of the Chase National Bank and one of the chief backers of Eisenhower . Is of the opinion that " corrective recessions " are not to be feared . But in any recession , however limited , it is the small business man who is knocked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credit , can usually " ride out " the slump and even profit from lower labor and other costs . The small business man has a. choice . He can back the Republican candidate and look-forward to an end of all the measures in his-behalf provided by the New and Fair Deal administrations . Or he can return the Democrats and expect relative stability and prosperity . Are You a Member of a , Minority Group ? If you are , and have suffered discrimination because of race , color , or creed  --  in education , housing , employment , the armed forces , or at the polls  --  you have little reason to hope for a change for the better if the Republicans win . Since 1948 a legislative program has been pending in Congress to insure civil rights in all these fields . It has been held up by the filibustering tactics of the Dixiecrats in combination with the Republicans . If- Eisenhower wins , the chances of enacting that program in 1953 are practically non-existent . The Democratic platform seeks au end to the filibuster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal opportunity in employment , the end of segregation in the armed forces , and equal participation in the nation 's political life . The Republican platform Is silent on the filibuster and on the issue of equal treatment in the armed forces . While it voices opposition to discrimination in employment , it would leave enforcement to the states , enacting federal legislation only as a supplement if necessary . How real is the opposition of the Republican standard-bearers to federal action against discrimination may be gauged by two significant facts : ( 1 ) Nixon and Taft , as members of the Senate Labor Committee , in 1952 filed a minority report opposing the establishment of a Fair Employment Practices The NATION Commission . ( 2 ) Democratic Governors Shivers of Texas , Byrnes of South Carolina , and Kennon of Louisiana , chief protagonists of the white-suprerriracy theory , have repudiated Stevenson , announced their support of Eisenhower , and called upon their followers to do likewise  --  as an expression of their opposition to the civil-rights plank of the Democratic Patty and the civil-rights views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern reactionaries ? Quite the contrary . He has welcomed it and in large measure indorsed their views . Are You a Naturalize-d American ? Or are you a newcomer to this country ? Have you relatives in Eastern or Southern Europe or in Asia whom you would like to bring to the United States ? Then you have something to fear from an Eisenhower victory . Because it will mean that the McCarran-Walter Omnibus Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 , described by Senator Herbert H.- Lehman as " a bill specifically designed to create a second-class group of citizens by holding the fear of denaturalization over the heads of hundreds of thousands of naturalized citizens , " will not be repealed . Condemned as " un-Christian " and " un-American " as recently as October 2 , 1952nby the Most Reverend Richard j . Cushing , Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston , this law ( 1 ) gives consuls and immigration officers unlimited authority to exclude aliens and deportnaturalized citizens ; ( 2 ) makes possible the exclusion of aliens on the basis of a guess as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalizes the denaturalization of any naturalized citizen who joins an organization on the Attorney General 's list or refuses to testify before a Congressional committee investigating subversive activities ; ( 4 ) threatens the foreign-born among us with possible deportation , with or without hearings , for acts - committed decades back which may have been lawful when they occurred ; ( 5 ) ; puts naturalized citizens abroad in jeopardy of loss of citizenship and exclusion from the United States without notice or hearings ; ( 6 ) cuts quotas in half for Latvia , Estonia , Greece , Hungary , Lithuania , Poland , and Rumania ; ( 7 ) lays October 18 , 1952 down a statutory discrimination against colonial peoples as well as all others whose family tree includes 50 per cent of " Asia-Pacific ancestors " ; ( 8 ) surrenders American sovereignty by delegating to foreign governments the power to decide which of their citizens or former citizens the United States may admit ; ( 9 ) provides for the deportation of political and religious refugees for a wide Variety of reasons . To be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was passed by the combined votes of Republicans and Dixiecrats . The fight against the McCarran bill was led by Democrats , together with one Republican , Senator Wayne Morse , who has withdrawn his support from Eisenhower . President Truman vetoed the bill , but his veto was overridden by fifty-seven to twenty-six in the Senate . Of the fifty-seven , thirty-two were Republicans and twenty-five Southern Democrats . Senators Taft , Nixon , and McCarthy voted for the McCarran act , against amendments to it , and to override the President 's veto . The Public Interest anil - Natural Resources A key test of the Republican pledge to improve the lot of the American people is the party 's position on the natural resources of the country . Eisenhower 's statements indicate that if he wins , the public interest will be sacrificed to that of the private power lobbies . The offshore-oil resources in two areas alone , Texas and California , are worth forty billion dollars . The Supreme Court has ruled that the interest in these resources is vested in all the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated turning these enormous assets back to the states . On a second basic question , how the country 's power resources shall be developed , Eisenhower has chosen the side of the private utilities even though-government development means cheap power , lower prices , more jobs , flood control , and much-needed conservation . " Anyone who thinks I am not sincerely interested in flood control and reclamation . . . is just simply talking through his hat , " said the General on October 4 . Maybe he was interested on that particular day . But on August 20 he was at tacking the Federal Conservation and Development Program , and on October 6 and 7 he wanted the private interests drawn into these undertakings . Power for the People In 1951 federal hydroelectric power Installations generated 45 billion kilowatt hours , 14 per cent of all the electric power sold in the country , an increase of 44Y2 billion since 1933 . Federal power flowing through an 18,500-mile network of government transmission lines has powered atomic development , new industries , homes , and farms ; assured flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Federal dams since 1933 have brought almost 2,500,000 new acres of land under irrigation , as compared to 706,000 new acres between 1920 and 1932 . Under the federal program a million families are the beneficiaries of conservation plans , with 18,000,000 acres of land restored through terracing , 2,000 , - 000 acres safeguarded from erosion , 5,000,000 acres leveled for irrigation , and 900,000 acres made ready for tree planting . Fifty-two million acres of pasture and range have been restored since 1936 ; timberlands are being preserved ; our mineral resources are being explored with a view to their conservation . The Bureau of Mines has discovered a method of making gasoline from coal on a commercial basis cheaply enough to compete with the natural product . The Power Interests Seek Control A constant battle , either against the expansion of these projects or for their control , is being waged by the power lobbies with the help of the Republicans in Congress . The private utilities are trying to prevent the construction of new dams unless the power is sold to them and to destroy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts . Electric power costs more in the Northeast than in any other section of the country . In New York the electricity consumer pays three times as much as his counterpart In the West . senator George D. Aiken of Vermont , a liberal Republican , stated in the Senate on February 9 , 1948 , that opponents of pending plans for federal construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway were seeking to hold up that development - until the utilities could get control of Niagara power . " If they succeed in doing so , " he said , " it will be the biggest steal of national resources ever put over on the people of this country . " In June , 1952 , Senator Aiken , referring to this prophecy , said : " It has come true to an alarming degree , for that is what they the private utilities ) are doing today . " The strength of Republican opposition to public power was demonstrated on June 18 , 1952 , when the Senate . voted , by a majority of three , to recommit the Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Lawrence development project . A majority of the Republicans voted for recommittal . If the Republicans win , Senator Harry P , Cain , Republican , of Washington , becomes chairman of the Public Works Committee ; . Senator Cain has the dubious distinction of being the power-lobby champion , h first Senator from his state in tivoity years to vote against low-cost public-power projects . Economy  --  at Whose Expenie ? Eisenhower says that a major goal of a Republican Administration would be to reduce government spending and effect savings of twenty-one billion dollars within four years . An alluring prospect ! But at whose expense ? Today 89 cents of every federal dollar budgeted by the federal government for the current year is spent for past , present , and potential wars  --  for direct military purposes , foreign military aid , interest on debt , veterans ' appropriations , atomic energy , merchant marine , and other activities related to defense . Only 3 per cent of federal funds is used for general administration ; 3 per cent for aid to business ; 2 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as price supports ; and 3 per cent for welfare . Since Eisenhower and the Republican Party believe in economizing on all forms of federal assistance , the chances are that any cuts made would be in these appropriations . Such cuts would affect the welfare of a majority of Americans . One-third of American families have an annual income of less than $2,000 . One-half have an annual income of less than $3,000 . These families need public housing , public education , public ' health services , cheap public power , soil conservation , and farm assistance . They need lower prices and lower taxes . What are they likely to get ? No Housing Relief In 1949 the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency estimated conservatively that a minimum of 1,250,000 sound and acceptable housing units would be needed each year for at least ten years to meet existing shortages and raise housing standards . In the 1920 's , 41 per cent of the new residential units built were for rental purposes . From 1946 to 1950 this was true- of only 17 per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this interval has built more than one million units . The cost per unit averaged $12,000 , $17,500 , and $25,4100 . But more than half of the families of America can not afford to pay more than $7,500 for a house . They need public housing . In 1948 , 76 per cent of the Republican members of the Senate , led by Senator McCarthy , killed a measure for slum clearance for public housing . Simi-lady , a Republican-Dixiecrat coalition killed a Senate bill to give housing assistance to middle-income families . In 1949 Congress passed a law authorizing the building of 135,000 public-housing units , as against a need for 1,250,000 . In 1951 the Senate forced the House to agree to 50,000 units to be Inuit 1952 . Senator Nixon was part of the coalition which tried to cut the number from 50,000 to 5,000 . Public-Education Squeeze Today 29,800,000 children attend public elementary and high schools . By 1960 their number is expected to increase to 37,000,000 . For them 200,000 new classrooms are needed now , and 375,000 in the near future . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to the construction of new buildings immediately . According to an April , 1952 , report of the United States Office of Education , two out of five buildings in twenty-five states , containing 21. per cent of the pupils , are totally unfit for use . One-third of our school population attends classes in fire traps . Local admin istrations are unable to raise more than half of the funds called for . To handle this situation the Administration proposed a $300,000,000 federal appropriation for educational necessities , to be dispensed by the states themselves . The bill was passed in the Senate over the opposition of the Republicans , led by McCarthy and including Taft . It was killed in the House by the G. 0 . P. In 1951 the Senate Republican-Dixiecrat coalition succeeded in cutting $50 , - 000,000 from a proposed $100,000,000 appropriation for defense-area schools . The 1952 Republican platform states that school needs should be left entirely to local and state authorities . Public-Health Neglect Forty million Americans live in communities without adequate public-health facilities . The so-called volunteer health insurance covers only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 26 per cent of hospital bills , and 12 per cent of total medical expenses . Yet when the Administration in 1951 sought a grant of $27,500,000 to create more local public-health units , 71 per cent of the Republicans in the Senate opposed the measure . The bill was passed in the Senate but was killed by the Republicans in the House . The Administration 's efforts to enact federal health insurance , which began in 1946 with the -Wagner-MurrayDingell bill , have been frustrated by the Republicans , headed by Senator Taft and spurred on by the American Medical Association . The lack of doctors and trained nurses throughout the country is alarming . By 1954 the doctor shortage is expected to reach between 20,000 and 25,000 . The current shortage of nurses is between 50,000 and 65,000 . An expenditure of $370,000,000 more a year is required to enable existing medical schools to perform their present functions . Ever since 1949 the Administration has tried to put through a five-year emergency program of assistance to medical , dental , and nursing schools . The A. M. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indorsed by Senator Taft , was killed in the Senate with the concurrence of Taft and by a vote of 91 per cent of the Republican members ; Nixon and McCarthy voted with the Republican majority . The Cost of Living The high cost of living is the most urgent and difficult problem for most Americans . During the war years and until 1946 , under OPA controls , living costs rose only 6.6 per cent . From June , 1946 , to May , 1952 , the cost of living has gone up 41.6 per cent . Why ? Living costs rose largely as a result of the attack on price controls by the Republican-Dixiecrat coalition led by Senator Taft . In June and July , 1946 , the OPA controls were killed by this coalition . By December , 1947 , prices had jumped 34 points . On February 18 , 1947 , the Republican-Dixiecrat coalition in the House ended OPA , over Democratic opposition , by cutting off funds . Has your rent gone up ? Thank the Republicans . In May , 1947 , 95 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " voluntary " rent increase . A special session of the Eightieth Congress , called by the President for the specific purpose of reinstituting price controls , was prevented by the Republicans from taking action , although living costs had risen 22 per cent and food prices 40 per cent . In 1948 and 1949 the Republicans were able to block action on the Administration 's request for stand-by rationing , price , wage , and commodity-speculation controls . The National Association of Manufacturers led the ' fight to abolish controls , promising the public in full-page advertisements that the end of controls would increase production and lead to early " adjustment of prices . " When the Korean war broke out , the Defense Production Act was passed , giving the Administration limited powers of price control . But by 1952 the Republican-Dixiecrat coalition had forced through crippling amendments which : virtually killed effective controls . Even before the war-time controls were officially ended in 1947 , the effectiveness of the CPA was destroyed by a Taft amendment permitting manufacturers to pass on to the consumer all increased costs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1951 similar amendments to the Defense Production Aot were passed , sponsored by Senator Capehart , .0CtOber 18 , 1952 Republican , of Indiana , and Representative Herlong , Republican , of Florida . Ceiling prices on meat were increased by one billion dollars as the result of the Butler ( R. , Nebraska ) amendment prohibiting slaughtering quotas . Taft , Nixon , and McCarthy voted against meat-price control . In 1952 the Republicans completed their contribution to the high cost of living by decontrolling fruit , vegetables , milk , and speculation in raw materials . The final ax was put to all federal rent controls . Senator Capehart , should the Republicans win this election , is scheduled to become chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , which controls price legislation . Who Will Benefit from Tax Cuts ? Eisenhower says a major goal of the Republican Party is lower taxes , possibly even 55 per cent lower . But who will benefit ? The Republican Eightieth Congress , despite three Presidential vetoes , passed a law lowering certain taxes . Under this law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married and with two children , benefited to the extent of 58.4 per cent ; a man who earned $50,000 a year , 29.1 per cent . But a man whose income was less than $5,000 a year , saved only 5.5 per cent . In 1950 and 1951 the RepublicanDixiecrat coalition succeeded in so raising individual income taxes that , according to the Wall Street Journal of November 28 , 1951 , " low-income individuals get the stiffest percentage in their federal income taxes . " A single person with a net income of $800 in 1952 will pay 25 per cent more than he paid in 1950. tut a person with an income of a million dollars a year will pay less than he paid two years ago . It is estimated that families making less than $1,000 per year today pay out in taxes , hidden and direct , approximately 23.6 per cent of their incomes . Corporations Protected by , G. 0 . P. The loopholes in the present tax laws favor oil companies , insurance companies , fictitious family partnerships and corporations , and high-bracket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators voted nine to one to delay a tax imcrease from January 1 , 1951 , to April 1 , 1951 . In the oil industry , for example , 271/2 per , cent of the value of oil produced is exempt from federal taxes on the theory that production depletes the owner 's assets . With tax loopholes plugged and adequate excess-profits taxes , ten billion dollars could be collected , G. 0 . P. Tax Program Serves the Rich The wage-earner and the low-income family will not benefit from the Republican tax prograM . For years the National Association of Manufacturers , a principal spokesman for the Republican Party , has been urging a federal sales tax . This would affect most seriously the middle- and lower-income families . Another Republican scheme is to place a constitutional limitation of 25 per cent on income taxes , whether personal or corporation taxes . Families making less than $20,000 a year would get no benefit under this plan . But the excess-profits tax on corporations would be wiped out and taxes on the very rich would go down as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plug the tax loopholes . The Republican platform makes no reference to this . Nixon , Taft , and McCarthy led the fight against price and wage controls and against efforts to plug the tax loopholes . In the light of the record , what is Eisenhower 's tax promise worth ? What Outlook for Peace with Ike ? Is peacepossible ? Who offers the best hope for peace ? Eisenhower or Stevenson ? Which party  --  the Republican or the Democratic ? These are the questions every American is asking . On the great issues of foreign policy what is Eisenhower offering his anxious countrymen ? On August 25 , In the text of his address before the American Legion , he said : " Our government once and for all , with cold finality , must tell the Kremlin that we shall never recognize the slightest permanence in Russia 's position in Eastern Europe and Asia . Never shall we rest content until the tidal mud of aggressive communism has receded within its own borders . " Is this a declaration of peace ? Hardly . And Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has put it plainly : " If there must be a war , let it be Asians against Asians , with our support on the side of-freedom . . . . We do not want Asia to feel that the white man of the West is its enemy . " As an immediate project his slogan is : Let 's bring our boys home from Korea . While this is a popular , human , and understandable wish , as a policy it increases the risk of extending the war in Asia . For Europe his proposal is " liberation , " which , if actually attempted , would mean total war . On the issue of war and peace Americans had the right to expect Eisenhower 's own ideas , not those of Taft , McCarthy , Knowland , Dewey , Dulles , and the China lobby . But every pronouncement Ike has made on - foreign policy is a rehash of the views of the reactionary Old Guard . The assumption ' must be that he shares them . Could the General , as President , de-. pendent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican Congress , provide a policy which would prevent war ? On the basis of his campaign and of the Republican record in Congress we do not believe he could . The Korean War Let 's take a look at the Korean war . Whether or not that war could have been avoided , there is something basically dishonest in Eisenhower 's repudiation of responsibility for the events which led up to it . Can he have forgotten that John Foster Dulles , his Republican platform writer , urged in the United Nations the original withdrawal of American troops from South Korea ? Or that the Joint Chiefs of Staff , of which he was a member , decided that American troops should be pulled out ? Or that General MacArthur gave the final 0 . K. for their withdrawal ? Has he forgotten that 60 per cent of the Republicans in Congress voted against a bill authorizing military assistance to Korea in 1949 ? Or that when the war broke out in Korea , Dulles sent a cable to the State- Department from Tokyo saying , " To sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a disastrous chain of events leading most probably to world evae ? Or that Senator Taft told the Senate on June 28 , 1950 : " If a joint resolution were introduced asking for approval of the use of our armed forces already sent to Korea and full support of them in their present venture , I would vote in favor of it " ? Has he forgotten that " his boy , " Dick Nixon , was among the 86 per cent of House Republicans who in 1950 voted against economic aid to Korea , thereby killing it ? G. 0 . P. and China Lobby Prevented Truce And is Eisenhower really ignorant of the reasons why our troops are still in Korea ? Two opportunities for honorable withdrawal from Korea followed the outbreak of the war . The first arose when we succeeded in pushing the North Koreans back across the Thirty-eighth Parallel . The United States and the U .. N. had achieved their objective , the Chinese Communists were not involved in the war , and there was every chance to make an honorable peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of Ike 's backers , says the reason was the insistence of MacArthur , who strongly opposed it and was supported by the Republicans in Congress . The Administration took MacArthur 's advice . The second opportunity arose after the intervention of the Chinese Communists . In the winter of 1951 India was able to win acceptance by the Chinese Communists of the basic principle of the resolution adopted by the United Nations on January 13 , 1951 , which would have establishedha ceasefire and arranged for subsequent negotiation of all outstanding questions . This response was rejected by the U. N. under United States prodding . Instead , Communist China was lonnally branded an aggressor : The initiative for peace , then lost by the U. N. , was never regained . Six months later the U. N. eagerly accepted similar terms in an atmosphere much less favorable , with the result that truce negotiations were launched which have now been dragging on for more than a year . Why did all this happen ? It happened because the Administration became the prisoner of the China lobby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and MacArthur . These men wanted no action which would give even de facto recognition to the Chinese Communists around a conference table . To prevent this , the Republican leadership then and now has been ready to risk extension of the war in Asia . From the very first General MacArthur , Senator Taft 's keynoter at the Republican convention , has favored the use of Chiang Kai-shek 's troops in Korea and an attack on Manchuria , even though this might mean converting the struggle into a war with Russia . With a few honorable exceptions , the Republicans in Congress have supported MacArthur and the powerful China lobby . Operations : ; the China Lobby On November 23 , 1950 , Senator Knowland urged that the neutralization of Formosa be ended and aid given to Chiang to fight the Chinese Communists on the mainland . On April 5 , 1951 , the Republican leader of the House of Representatives , Joseph W. Martin , made public a letter from MacArthur indorsing the use of Chiang's- troops to open a second front on the Chinese mainland . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On February 12 , - 1952 , Senator Taft expressed himself as favoring Chiang 's invasion of the Chinese mainland , saying that he saw a 600,000-man army begging to be sent to do the job . As recently as June , 1952 , Taft was saying that we could have won the war in Korea if we had followed the advice of ? our greatest soldier , General MacArthur . Not only has Senator Nixon accepted the Taft ? China lobby attitude , but a public-relations representative of the China lobby helped Nixon in his senatorial campaign . Plan Chiang War with U. S. Backing When Eisenhower calls for the withdrawal of our troops from Korea and a war by Asians against Asians , what does he mean ? Would he actually leave the South Koreans to fight alone against the Chinese and the North Koreans ? Would he expect them to win such a war ? Is not the implication rather , given the **38;1295;TOOLONG position , that we should be ready to finance Chiang to make war on Red China at an appropriate momerit ? And If this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the result ? Could Chiang reconquer China ? And could such a war fail to involve other parts of Asia  --  and Russia ? Let 's look at the record of Chiang Kai-shek . The United States has never withdrawn its support of Chiang . Between 1945 and 1949 , $1,600,000,000 was given to the Chinese Nationalists by the United States . Chiang lost the war against the Chinese Communists not because he lacked military support . He lost it because of the corruption and inefficiency of his rule and his refusal to introduce necessary reforms . What reason is there to believe that the same Chiang , even if armed to the teeth with American weapons , could win the vast millions of hungry Chinese to his side , as Eisenhower and Taft apparently assume ? As for the concept that such a war could be limited , who except the most cynical would take that risk in the context of present world events ? How , then , is the **26;1335;TOOLONG policy a formula for peace ? Do you buy it ? We do notl The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eisenhower has another formula called " liberation , " taken over from John Foster Dulles , scheduled to be Secretary of State if Ike wins . In his speech before the American Legion in New York , Eisenhower announced that the slave states of Eastern Europe must be liberated . On September 23 he said : " We shall help each captive nation to maintain an outward strain against its Moscow bond . " How Dulles and Eisenhower propose to liberate the peoples of the " slave states " of Eastern Europe by peaceful means ' neither has said . Dulles proposes to give these peoples " moral " backing in . their resistance to Soviet domination . But when even so innocuous an instrument of moral encouragement as the Voice of America came up for support in Congress , 70 per cent of House Republicans in August , 1951 , voted to reduce its appropriation by $15,000,000 . And ' as recently as October 8 Ike himself was sneering at the Voice of America . But such an " innocuous " operation is not what other Republicans have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully spon , October 18 , 1952 sored in the last Congress an amendment to the Mutual Security Act providing a $100,000,000 fund to help finance resistance in the satellite countries . And in a statement issued from General Eisenhower 's headquarters , Kersten denounced the policy of containment and declared that " it would be immoral and Jul-Christian " to negotiate a state of " peaceful coexistence " with Russia . Dulles , after first talking about air drops of machine-guns and other supplies , then about passive resistance and industrial sabotage in Eastern Europe , on September 3 came to the conclusion that " aggressive despots must be slowed down and stopped from within or we shall have to check them from without in the bead-on collision of atomic war . " What does this mean except ultimate war ? Has Eisenhower repudiated Kersten and Dulles ? He has not . Republicans Oppose Defense Perimeter Though the foreign policy of the present Administration is subject to criticism at many points , It has none the less produced for the United States both allies and a " defense perimeter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built by the Marshall Plan , the . North Atlantic Treaty ; the organization and support of the United Nations , and assistance to underdeveloped areas . Much more could have been done , must be done , particularly in the way of Point Four aid . But at least among the Democratic leadership there is a growing realization that the best weapon against communism is the knowledge of what constitutes its appeal , that there is need for alliances with peoples and not just with military machines . The majority of Republican members of Congress have opposed all these undertakings . Senator Taft opposed American participation in the United Nations , which still remains the one international instrument for achieving world peace . Senator jenner offered an amendment to the ' Japanese peace . treaty which stated that " in consenting to ratification of the - treaty the Senate does not give political sanction or prestige to the principles of the U. N. Charter or the eclaration of Human Rights . " In October , 1951 , 72 per cent of the Republicans in the House voted to put an arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now costs the American taxpayer about 77 cents a year . Senator Taft opposed the Marshall Plan . Senators Taft , Nixon , and McCarthy voted against American troops for NATO . All three Eisenhower stalwarts voted to cut the appropriations for the Mutual Security Act . All three opposed the assistance to underdevel. oped areas which was part of the campaign of the United States to destroy the poverty which breeds communism . In 1950 , 85 per cent of the Senate Republicans tried to stall Point Four by appointing a study commission ; 80 per cent of the House Republicans voted to kill it by a rnetion to recommit . In the same year 76 per cent of the Senate Republicans voted against the bill . The North Atlantic Treaty is not even mentioned in the Republican platform although the Republican candidate was its director . Taft voted against the treaty . In May , 1952 , 73 per cent of Senate Republicans in the last Congress , over Eisenhower 's protest , voted to cut a. billion dollars from the appropriation for the revival of the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike 's Governor Adlai Stevenson . offers a policy of joining with other nations " in building ' military , economic , and por litical strength , which can gradually but surely lessen the relative power - of the Soviet Union on world events . " He urges strengthening the United Nations , increasing Point Four aid , renewing and extending reciprocal trade agreements . He has stated his credo on war and peace in these words : " Not in the ashes of another world war but only in the atmosphere of a peaceful world can the reffirmation of the ' right of self-determi. nation have any meaning . I will never , fear to negotiate in good faith with the Soviet Union , for to close the door to the conference room is to open the door to war . " Contrast this with Eisenhower 's proposed policy of paying foreign armies to fight wars for " freedom " and with the isolationist , jingoist record of the Republicans in Congress  --  the " team " Ike wants elected with him . This is the Republican leadership on whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ?
