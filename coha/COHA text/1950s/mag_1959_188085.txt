Mitzie Epstein was just 19 when she quit fashion-design school in 1924 , gave up her chance for a career and married Samuel Irving Newhouse , the hustling , 28-year-old publisher of the Staten Island ( N.Y. ) daily Advance . Last month , when Sam Newhouse went looking for the proper gift for their 35th wedding anniversary , he had a good basis to go on-Mitzie , a delicate wisp of a woman ( 5 ft. , 76 Ibs. ) who likes to wear originals by Dior and Givenchy , still has a high interest in high fashion . Last week Sam came home with just the right present : Conde Nast Publications Inc. , publishers of the haute couture Vogue ( circ. 415,258 ) , House &; Garden ( circ. 576,196 ) , and their svelte siblings Glamour ( circ. 668,062 ) and Bride 's Magazine ( circ. 169,902 ) . Grins Newhouse : " I thought Mitzie would get a thrill out of it . " <P> Same Fashion , Same Formula . To land Mitzie her prize present , Sam ( " Mr. S.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has used for four decades to collect an unusual group of 14 newspapers and five TV and radio stations . Just a fortnight ago , Newhouse heard that Cond Nast President and Publisher Iva Sergei ( " Pat " ) Voidato-Patcvitch , 58 , was willing to sell his option to buy controlling interest in the company , which he got last fall from Britain 's Amalgamated Press . Hard hit by recession cutbacks in ads , Cond Nast Publications lost $534,528 last year-although Vogue finished in basic black . But Newhouse was so convinced of Cond Nast 's potential that he did not even bother to take a hard look at the books , talked only briefly to Patcvitch before agreeing to plunk down some $5,000,000 for 51% control . <P> Publisher Newhouse will use the same principle with Cond Nast that underlies his newspaper empire : a high degree of local autonomy . Mitzie Newhouse may have an occasional casual chat with an editor , and Mr. S.I . will keep his sharp eye on the ledger , but Cond Nast will continue to be run on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " A Brash Kid . " The eldest son of a Russian immigrant factory worker , Sam Newhouse got his first chance at turning a profit from publishing as a 16-year-old clerk for a New York judge . When the judge got control of the floundering Bayonne ( N.J. ) Times , he gave Newhouse a try at running the show . Within a year Newhouse had whipped the Times into the black ( " I guess I was a pretty brash kid " ) . In 1922 he drummed up $98,000 and bought the Staten Island Advance . <P> Ever since , shrewd Businessman Newhouse has been completely fascinated by newspapers ( " I like the glamour " ) , has memorized such a store of data about the nation 's press that he can often calculate within minutes whether or not to buy : in 1955 he decided to pay $5,500,000 for the Portland Oregonian after a single phone call . Only two of his 14 papers were solidly in the black at purchase ( the Oregonian and the Birmingham News ) ; now all are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
