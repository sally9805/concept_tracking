The Suez Canal company , comprised of capital and personnel of several countries , including the United States , was to have handed over its concession to Egypt Nov. 17 , 1968 , under the terms of an agreement with the Egyptians . The canal company 's board of directors has its headquarters in Paris . Action Already Law President Nasser read a presidential decree announcing Egypt 's takeover of the canal . He said the action already had been published in today 's Official Gazette and therefore was law . What action the company , or the countries involved , could or would take to counteract the action could not be determined . " Britain and the United States were offering us $70,000,000 to help build the dam , tied up with economic ' domination as a prelude to political domination , " President Nasser ' declared .

The World Bank had said it was willing to lend Egypt $200,000,000 for the second stage . These offers fell through when the United States announced last week that developments during the last seven months had led to the decision that Egypt was incapable of carrying out the project . The Soviet Union stepped into the picture last December when Ambassador Solod D. S. made a vaguely general offer to help Egypt build the dam . However , when Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitri T. Shepilov came to Cairo a month ago he apparently told the Egyptians that Moscow considered some short-range development projects more important .
