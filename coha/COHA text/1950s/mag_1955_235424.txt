In his two years as president of the National Broadcasting Co. , eupeptic Sylvester L. ( " Pat " ) Weaver made the newspapers almost as often as NBC 's program timetables . He pushed the so-called " magazine concept " of selling TV ad time to several sponsors per show , popularized the hour-and-a-half " spectacular " program , thought up NBC 's Wide , Wide World and long-winded Monitor . But all this was not entirely to the liking of David Sarnoff , 64 , board chairman of NBC 's parent company , Radio Corp . of America . Madison Avenue gossiped that Pat Weaver was getting too much personal publicity-and at a bad time : NBC 's share of the TV business and ratings were dropping . In November , for the first time in TV history , NBC failed to place a single TV show in the top ten Trendex ratings ( TIME , Nov. 28 ) , Last week David Sarnoff announced that Weaver would move up to board chairman , with a new ten-year contract and a salary raise , to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business " while " Bob will be carrying on the day-to-day operations , and planning ahead . " " Bob " is Sarnoff 's son , Robert W. , 37 . <P> The change apparently made Bob NBC 's chief executive officer , the position that Weaver had once had . A native of Manhattan and a Harvard graduate ( ' 39 ) , Bob Sarnoff started to learn broadcasting as a Navy communications officer , later worked for the Des Moines Register and Look magazine , before he joined NBC as a time salesman in 1948 . He proved a good salesman and capable administrator , was moved up to NBC vice president in 1951 and executive vice president in 1953 . <P> Said the elder Sarnoff last week : " I am confident that , under the continued leadership of Pat and Bob , NBC will achieve even greater heights of success .
