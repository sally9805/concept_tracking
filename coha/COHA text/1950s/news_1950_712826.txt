txt Harry R. Bridges was sentencec today by Federal Judge George B. Harris to serve five years ix orison for swearing falsely at his 1945 naturalization hearing that he never had been a member of the Communist party . The Australian-born longshore leader also received a two-year sentence for conspiracy to obstruct and defeat the naturalization laws , but the sentences are to run concurrently . A move by the prosecution to have the court sign an order revoking Bridges ' citizenship was delayed until tomorrow . The defense promised to fight the proposal , which Government counsel has declared is mandatory under the law . Revocation of citizenship would be a step in a new move to deport the militant labor leader if the verdict were upheld by the Supreme Court . Bridges ' co-defendants , Henry Schmidt and James R. Robertson , drew two-year prison terms on each of two counts . Their sentences likewise are to run concurrently , so that two years is the maximum either will serve . They had been found guilty of conspiring with Bridges to defeat the naturalization laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his false swearing . Judge Harris might have imposed fines totaling $15,000 on each of the defendants but , speaking directly to Bridges , president of the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , he said : " A fine might result in an assessment on the rank and file members of the union , and I see no reason to add a burden on them in the present situation . " Bridges ' bail , unde which he has been free since the grand jury returned the indictments last May , was raised from $5,000 to $25,000 after Robert B. , assistant Federal Attorney , had mentioned a figure of $100,000 and the defense had termed it " preposterous . " The $5,000 bail in which Schmidt and Robertson also had been held was raised to $10,000 for each of them . Judge Harris imposed the sentences after hearing a full day of argument by Vincent Hallinan and James M. on motions for . a new trial and arrest of judgment . The court denied both motions and the attorneys filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a trial of four and one-half months followed by four days of deliberation by the jurors . A hitch developed late in the day on the question of posting bail , and Judge Harris recessed court until 10 A. - M. tomorrow , leaving Edward A. Mitchell , the court clerk , to deal with the matter . The recess , rather than an adjournment , was taken so that it would be unnecessary for the defendants to spend the night in jail . Accused time after time by the defense attorneys of showing bias and unfairness toward the defendants ' case , of exhibiting bitterness and hatred toward the lawyers themselves , Judge Harris denied the charges for the record . When the case was finally submitted at 3:55 P. M. ( 6:55 P. M. New York time ) , the court declared that Bridges ' guilt had been " established to a moral certainty and beyond reasonable doubt by devastating and overwhelming testimony " and that the same was true of the co-defendants . No Hysteria , Says Court Judge Harris said the charge that the verdict was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Court , " that it represented " an oblique attack on militant trade unionism " or " pressures by the United States Government or some parts of it " constituted " distortions of fact , misconceptions and untruths . " " By lying , cheating and defrauding the United States Government , " the Court continued , " Mr. Harry Bridges was granted a certificate of naturalization , aided and abetted by his two co-defendants . Thus , Harry Bridges had bestowed upon him the most priceless heritage known to man , the citizenship of the United States . His conduct can not invoke sympathy or consideration on my part . The jury has spoke n , the mandate of the law is clear , the dictates of justice demand that the verdict be carried out . " Bridges and his counsel , Mr. Hallinan , were called to the bar at the end of the Court 's address . The attorney moved for probation , then for referral of the defendant to the probation officer . Judge Harris denied both motions and then imposed the sentences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . Hallinan Calls Court Unfair In his argument for a new trial , Mr. Hallinan charged that the prosecution of Bridges was actually " a political campaign employing the courts to get rid of a man because his economic and political convictions were different from those of the man who represents the . Government . " " You anticipated the entire case , " he told the Court . " When the evidence came in you did n't change your attitude . " Mr. Hallinan told Judge Harris that he had " thought I could rely on your native fairness because 1 had known you for . many years . " Then the attorney , who had received two six-month sentences for contempt , to run concurrently , observed that surely the judge could not think the dignity of the court could be upheld by " a subservient and truckling bar . " Mr. Maclnnis , who is under a three-month contempt sentence , asserted in his own argument : " If there is a prize for perjury , if there is a bounty for lies , if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong . " He said he could not accept Judge Harris ' disclaimer of bitterness and hatred toward the attorneys , and added : " You will have to line the rest of your life with your conscience , with what you have done . " Mr. , for the Government , told the court that Mr. Hallinan 's remarks constituted " just another of those paroxysms of scurrility " representing " the effervescence of his spleen toward Your Honor .
