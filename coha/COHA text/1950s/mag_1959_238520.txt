Giant , sprawling Calcutta , where a hundred thousand homeless refugees sleep on the streets every night , is the most explosive city in India . Murderous riots can be touched off by anything from a trifling rise in streetcar fares to the throat-cutting religious strife that killed thousands in 1946 . Calcutta rioters have even perfected their own secret weapon : electric-light bulbs filled with nitric acid . <P> Last week India 's Communists chose inflammable Calcutta to show their defiance of Nehru 's government for its act in ousting the Reds from power in the state of Kerala ( TIME , Aug. 10 ) . They had plenty of tinder at hand : the soaring food costs and the rice shortage , which are spreading misery in Calcutta and all West Bengal . Starving mobs have halted freight trains and looted the cars of food . Confidently using the tactics employed against them in Kerala , the Reds fired off a 53-page " charge sheet " against the West Bengal administration of Chief Minister Dr. B. C. Roy , the 77-year-old leader of the local Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nepotism and graft - much of it true . A " Famine Resistance Committee " drew up plans for mass defiance of the law and set August 20 as the trysting day . <P> Dr. Roy asked angrily how defiance of law " could increase the supply of food grains to the state ? " More to the point , he reinforced West Bengal 's 35,000 police with troops from the National Volunteer <P> Forces . Two nights before the scheduled demonstration , police squads fanned out through the sleeping city and hauled from their rope beds some 100 Communist and left-wing leaders . <P> Hamstrung by the arrest of their chiefs and also by the defection of the Praja-Socialists , who used to join them but have been wary since Tibet , the Reds were unable to fill the streets with raging thousands , could muster on successive days only a few hundred , who were carted off to jail still waving red flags and shouting slogans . Communist agitators pleaded with the onlooking crowds to lie in the streets in passive resistance , but won no volunteers . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists had this time saved West Bengal 's flabby administration . Undeterred , the Reds set August 31 as the new date when " fire will rage through Calcutta . "
