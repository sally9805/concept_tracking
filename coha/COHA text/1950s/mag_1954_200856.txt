MANHATTAN 'S staid Frick Collection last week put on display the elaborately splendid painting opposite . Begun by Jan van Eyck , and finished after his death by his disciple Petrus Christus , it has the grace and precision , the atmosphere of Tightness and relaxation , common to Early Flemish masterpieces . The picture shows the Virgin and Child flanked by Saints Barbara and Elizabeth of Hungary . Kneeling in adoration is the Carthusian prior who commissioned the painting for his church in 1441 . Acquired a century ago by Paris ' Baron de Rothschild , the picture has now passed to the Frick-for a rumored $1,000,000 . <P> In museums , the great religious art of the past ceases to be an aid to worship and becomes something less : the delight of art lovers . Visiting the U.S. last winter , French Critic Andre Malraux went so far as to declare that the nation 's museums have become its real churches . <P> Missing Spark .

Shortly before his own death this year , Father Couturier wrote that " Christian art is dead . " <P> Couturier went on to explain that today 's sacred art is " constantly repeating the old styles of past centuries , slavishly rebuilding romanesque , gothic or renaissance churches , never utilizing modern forms until they are already outmoded-or else employing them artificially , in ... borrowings that lack any spontaneous spark of life . For more than a century , imagination-the true innovator of all new forms-has remained completely outside of , and alien to , the Church . . . The only great Christian artist alive , Rouault , had to wait until he reached the age of eighty before seeing one of his works admitted to a church . " <P> But Couturier was a bit harsh . The very fact that Rouault was admitted ( to the little church at Assy-TIME , June 20 , 1949 ) shows that the situation has begun , just barely , to improve . <P> Couturier himself supervised the adorning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lger , Chagall and Bonnard , and he inspired Matisse to design , singlehanded , a chapel at Vence . Frank Lloyd Wright , among others , has produced radically new churches in the U.S. , and Andr Girard 's stained glass for a chapel at Palo Alto , Calif . ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) is rich in ideas . The Vatican has been called , with good reason , a citadel of conservatism in art , yet it has commissioned a rugged individualist named Giacomo Manzu to design a new door for St. Peter's.
