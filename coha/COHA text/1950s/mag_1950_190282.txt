In Chicago , United Paramount Theaters , Inc. signed an agreement to pipe Western Conference football games into three Chicago theaters and one in Detroit . Since no Big Ten games will be telecast to the public this fall , the four theaters will have exclusive rights to the games as they are played . NBC Vice President " Chic " Showerman happily ticked off the advantages : " On large-screen theater TV you can smell the players , they 're that close . You can go to a game , you wo n't have to wear the old raccoon coat , and you do n't have to get drunk . "
