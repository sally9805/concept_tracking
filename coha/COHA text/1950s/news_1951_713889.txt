READ , Letters to The Times Fighting Civil Corruption Creation of Unit to Prosecute Corrupt City Employes Is Asked To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As department after department of the city government comes under the scrutiny of the grand juries and of the prosecutors , a condition of corruption is being exposed which sickens the public . Obviously there has been a price tag on too many things in the city 's bargain basement . The current investigations and the public reaction which they have aroused will put a stop for the time being to most of these rackets . But as time passes and the public forgets , there are bound to be further recurrences unless , while we are awake , we set up machinery designed to eliminate this type of corruption in the future . We do not need more laws and more safeguards to protect us against those many public servants whose careers are living testimonials to the maxim that public office is a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those to whom principle means nothing who create our problem . As to those , the only solution is one which will literally prove crime does not pay . The money nerve is a powerful one , and has been proved to have a deterrent effect upon those who are never moved by principles or by oaths of office . This has been emphasized for us by the Kefauver committee , which , in its report on organized crime in interstate commerce , concluded that one of the most effective sanctions against organized gambling was to tax away the earnings of the gamblers . British Decision The British courts just a few months ago gave us the method to keep our public servants honest by holding that any bribes which they accepted belonged to their employer , the Crown , A British Army sergeant , stationed in Cairo , on several occasions while in uniform boarded a private truck loaded with whisky and brandy and escorted it to Cairo , thus enabling it to pass through the city without being inspected by the police . The investigation which brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile , large and unexplained bank accounts and unusual amounts of currency . Some twenty thousand pounds were found to have been paid to the sergeant by the proprietors of the trucks , and the British Government promptly laid claim to them , On March 16 the British House of Lords ( the highest court in England ) without benefit of statute but solely on the basis of the common law , which is common to both England and the United States , ruled that bribes received by a public employe belonged to the Crown . The judges pointed out that the uniform of the Crown and the position of the sergeant as a servant of the Crown were the only reasons why he was able to get this money , and that that is sufficient to make him hand it over to the Crown . They ruled that " if a servant takes advantage of his service and violates his duty of honesty and good faith to make a profit for himself in the sense that the assets of which he has control , the facilities which he enjoys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position which he occupies , are the real cause of his obtaining the money as distinct from merely affording the opportunity for getting it  --  that is to say , they play the predominant part in his obtaining it  --  then he is accountable for it to the master . It matters not that the master has not lost any profit nor suffered any damage , nor does it matter that the master could not have done the act himself . If the servant has unjustly enriched himself by virtue of his service without his master 's sanction , the law says that he ought not to be allowed to keep the money , but it shall be taken from him and given to his master , because he got it solely by reason of the position which he etoupied as a servant of his master . " Eliminating Motive This is a good doctrine and one which we should utilize . If the Corporation Counsel were to establish a unit in his office charged with the duty of obtaining civil judgments against all municipal employes found to have accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unit were established on a permanent basis , the financial motive that has brought about the present situation would be eliminated . When crime , like other businesses , becomes unprofitable and does not pay it can be controlled . The British , in the case of Reading vs. the Attorney General , have given us a good precedent and pattern . Let us hope that the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel will reinforce the present disclosures and prosecutions by depriving the faithless servants of the fruit of their crimes and thus setting up the necessary pressure to kill the annetite of the money nerve . RICHARD H. WELL New York , June 6 , 1951 . Industry 's Preference for Beginners To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : You report in THE TIMES of June 4 that graduating engineers ? who are without practical experience ? are receiving starting salaries of $300 to $500 a month , $3,600 to $6,000 a year . If an engineer has had ten , fifteen or twenty years of successful experience he should be worth two to five times the beginner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . Are the companies that are hiring beginners at such salaries paying their experienced engineers in proportion ? Would these companies hire an experienced available engineer and pay him $15,000 or $20,000 a year ? Not in the East , from what we are able to learn . Not only beginners in engineering are receiving high salaries ; in other fields as well the practice prevails . I know of one senior , majoring in advertising , who starts work in an advertising job paying $95 a week . In contrast , I know of another advertising man with twenty years of experience packed with many successful accomplishments who is having difficulty in securing a job which will pay $125 a week or more . And it is not age that is against him . He has a wonderful record . Industry complains that there is an insufficient number of experienced and qualified management executives available . If industry would announce that it would pay $25,000 a year to a qualified man , the number of available men would be surprising . C. B. HOWARD , Chairman , Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . West Hartford , Conn , , June 4 , 1951 . Issues in Huleh Dispute Effect on Arab Community of Project to Reclaim Basin Reviewed To THE EDITOR OF the NEW YORK TIMES : Fairness and impartiality have , as always , characterized your treatment of the dispute between Israel and Syria over the Huleh Basin in Palestine , but the fundamental issues involved are worth sharper emphasis . Title to the area in question ; At the conclusion of the armistice in 1949 the Basin was occupied by Syrian troops and contained a large Arab population . Instead of being ceded to Syria , however , as other parts of Arab Palestine were ceded to Jordan , the Basin was held in trusteeship because of its significance for the strategy and the water supply of the region , with its final disposition to be settled later . It . is , then , premature to refer to it as " Israeli demilitarized territory . " Strategic importance : Drainage of the swamps and of tile lake itself will create valuable agricultural land and improve health conditions , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies . This . should be a matter of negotiation between Syria and Israel . Water rights : Draining of swamps and lakes and canalization of small streams decreases evaporation but increases flow . This reduces waste but exaggerates seasonal differences in water supply , and may or may not be desirable . It affects the whole Jordan valley , however , since the most of its water comes from the Buleli Basin . If the flow is to be affected , those states which possess riparian rights , Israel , Syria and Jordan , should agree to what is to be done . Actually , the project to drain Ilia lake and swamps has a long history . A concession for it was granted to Beirut merchants in 1914 by the Ottoman Empire , and this was revived by the Jewish Palestine Land Development Company in 1934 . Irrigation projects supposed to benefit from the scheme lie not only in the Basin itself but also in Galilee and tile coastal plain , since water can be brought by gravity over the water-shed of the Jalud River at Afulah to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , a substantial withdrawal of Huleh water from the Jordan valley altogether would seriously affect the Arab communities of Jordan , of which Jericho , with its famed oranges , is best known . The Lowdermilk plan of 1943 rather callously contemplated replacing such losses with salt water siphoned over from the Mediterranean , while the report of the Clapp Commission of the United Nations in 1949 concluded that the whole plan was impractical , in view of the difficulty of securing Jordanian agreement , to a plan which would render much of its territory infertile . So far as I know , there has been no clear statement of Israeli objectives in the Huleh , beyond the evident ones of draining and appropriation . The Arab states and the United Nations would be reassured if it were certain that an evident benefit to Israel did not carry with it an intolerable injury and injustice to one or more of its Arab neighbors .

Shooting of Crazed Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The front page news item " Policeman 's Shot Kills Crazed Man , " appearing in THE TIMES of June 5 , should lead us to hang our heads in shame . When the throwing of a vase or a threatening with a pen becomes adequate cause for gunplay on the part of professionally trained law-enforcement officers , then justice is not being enforced but assaulted . To take a man 's life , however perverted that life may be , is always a very serious thing . But how terrible it is when irresponsibility is camouflaged by a veil of justice . L. M.
