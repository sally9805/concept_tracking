When President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke an unwritten White House rule and gave New York Timesman Arthur Krock an exclusive interview in 1937 , the Washington press corps sizzled with rage at such " favoritism . " F.D.R. promptly apologized ( his head was " on the block , " he said ) , and most of the newsmen forgave him . Last week Timesman Krock , who won a Pulitzer Prize for his first White House beat , *set White House regulars sizzling again with another exclusive presidential interview ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . But Harry Truman had no apologies . At his weekly press conference the next day , correspondents in the first row , close enough to bang on the President 's desk , looked mad enough to do it . Harry Truman glowered right back . <P> Like It or Lump It . The U.P . ' s Merriman Smith fired the first question . Had the President been correctly quoted about the possibility of still sending Chief Justice Vinson on a mission to Moscow ? Truman asked sharply whether Smith had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to read it again . <P> Then the President tilted his head back in a characteristic little mannerism , which both announces that he is ready for a fresh question and helps his astigmatic eyes spot the next questioner through his glasses . He spotted a fellow Missourian , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 's able Raymond Brandt . Brandt asked whether the Krock interview had been authorized in that form . It had been , said the President . <P> <P> He turned again . The New York Herald Tribune 's Carl Levin asked whether the interview represented " a softening of your attitude . " No , the President said . Then he paused , squared his shoulders , and told the assembled reporters that they could like it or lump it . The President was his own free agent , he said . He would see whom he pleased , when he pleased , and say what he pleased to anybody he pleased , and he was not to be censored by them or anybody else . He did n't like their attitude this morning and they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody said a word . Then radio 's elderly ( 68 ) Earl Godwin , who seldom raises his voice to dispute the President , replied : " Sir . . . these gentlemen feel that the Krock interview is a reflection on every bureau chief and reporter in Washington . " Retorted Truman : It was nothing of the kind . Another reporter wondered whether the President had intended to omit the " damn " in " say what he pleases . " Said the President : Yes , but he would put it in if they wanted him to . When the President tried to change the subject again , Doris Fleeson , whose syndicated column appears in the Fair Dealing New York Post , stuck to the old one . Said she acidly : " Some of us think our business is very important . " Snapped the President : Sometimes he was not so sure .
