To lure away the vultures that are ever present in Kano , even on the tree-shaded grounds of Kano 's Central Hotel , carrion had been dumped outside the city , and by the time the royal visitors flew in last week scarcely a bird could be seen . The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester , representing their niece , Queen Elizabeth , were on their way to Kaduna to attend the biggest durbar ( homage to princes ) in northern Nigeria 's history . <P> For three hours at Kaduna. 3,000 turbaned horsemen , 7,000 warriors in medieval chain mail , archers , lancers , musketeers , musicians , dancers , tumblers and snake charmers paraded by . The durbar celebrated self-government for northern Nigeria , the last step before Nigeria as a whole-now a federation of three regions , each with its own Premier-would become independent within the Commonwealth in 1960 . " The future may not be easy for you , " warned the Queen of England through her uncle . " You have a heavy task before you . " <P> Just what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regal host of last week 's durbar , the aristocratic Premier of the Northern Region , Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello , the Sardauna of Sokoto . Since Nigeria is the most populous ( 35 million ) of Britain 's African territories , whoever becomes its first federal Prime Minister after independence is potentially the most important politician in Africa . And no one will have more to say about who that man will be than the Sardauna of Sokoto . <P> Reluctant Progress . To the outside world , he is not nearly as well known as his two fellow Premiers . In spite of a spate of political scandals , U.S.-educated Nnamdi ( " Zik " ) Azikiwe remains the undisputed leader of the Eastern Region , is almost solely responsible for raising the Ibos from tribal backwardness to their present positions in government in the Eastern Region and in education . A British-educated barrister . Chief Obafemi Awolowo , Premier of the Western Region , runs the most efficient government of all . But the crucial fact remains that the Sardauna in the north rules a land of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the size of the other two regions put together and in the next federal Parliament will hold 174 out of 320 seats . <P> Now 49 , the Sardauna is a direct descendant of the fabled Fulani Imam who in 1802 launched the holy war that eventually brought northern Nigeria to its knees . In 1900 the British proclaimed the region a protectorate . They ended the beheadings , the chopping off of hands and the slave trade , but they deliberately did not destroy the power of the emirs and the chiefs-under a characteristically empirical British policy known as " indirect rule . " So it was not until 1956 that the Northern Region held its first direct elections to its Assembly , not until this year that its rulers finally got around to accepting self-government . Even today the emirs can appoint kadis ( Moslem judges ) with complete authority to fine , jail and tax .
