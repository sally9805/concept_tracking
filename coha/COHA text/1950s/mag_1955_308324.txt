Slow-moving Premier Scelba won an important victory last week in the Italian Senate , pushing through the Paris accords and thus making Italy the first nation on the Continent to complete ratification of West German rearmament . But it looked as if it might be the last piece of major business that he would carry off as Premier . The long knives were out for Scelba . <P> The Senate debate on European Union was an unseemly brawl in which Communists and Neo-Fascists called each other cowards , ruffians , traitors , deserters , fools , imbeciles , murderers and idiots . Scelba 's Christian Democrats did not need the Fascist support , but they had it anyway . In the balloting , only the Communists and their allies , the Nenni Socialists ( plus one lone independent ) , voted against the accords . The tally : 139 to 82 . <P> Clarification ? While this was going on , a quieter but more deadly fight was going on inside Scelba 's own four-party coalition . With only a twelve-vote majority in the lower chamber , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coalition . Scelba has proposed new laws to relieve-slightly-the maze of government controls and regulations , dating from the Fascist era , on landowners in their relations with tenant farmers . On this point both Republicans and Liberals threatened to walk out on the coalition-the Republicans because they thought the Scelba changes would give the landowners too much advantage , the free-enterprising Liberals because they thought the nation 's millions of landowners were not getting enough of a break . <P> It was an opportune moment for Amintore Fanfani , the influential , ambitious and impulsive secretary-general of the Christian Democrats . Carefully taking no side in the dispute , he caused consternation in the Scelba ranks by demanding a " clarification " ( i.e. , showdown ) right away . Scelba pleaded for time until certain hurdles were safely past : his own impending good will visit to the U.S. ( later this month ) , the election of a new President in May , the Sicilian regional elections in June . <P> Bold New Course . For a few days , Fanfani seemed to concur ; then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarification would give " Amico Scelba " more stature and standing on his U.S. tour . Said Fanfani : " If there is unrest among other parties of the coalition , there is also doubt in the ranks of Christian Democrats about whether we can continue with the present arrangement . " <P> Besides , added Fanfani , Christian Democracy in Italy needs a strong new course-more efficient government administration , passage of new petroleum laws , completion of agrarian reforms , tax laws with teeth , a new public works program for roads and housing , restoring order from chaos in the government-run I.R.I. ( Italian equivalent of the Reconstruction Finance Corp . ) . His implication was clear : Amintore Fanfani , not " Amico Scelba , " is the man to lead such a program . <P> " Once these clarifications start , " said a disconsolate Christian Democrat , " it 's pretty certain that Scelba will be clarified right out of office .
