Henry Bellamann , musician and teacher , hoped to write a three-volume novel about the lives and loves of his home , own , Fulton , Mo . ( pop . 10,040 ) . The first volume , Kings Row , published in 1940 , leaded bestseller lists , sold more than a million copies , was made into a movie ' starring Robert Cummings and Ann sheridan ) that kept much of the novel 's sadism , incest and violence . After Bella-nann 's death in 1945 , his wife Katherine completed and published his Parris Mitchell of Kings Row . The third volume has never been written . <P> Last week Katherine Bellamann , sixtyish , promised to " continue the story " on 1 new radio show called Kings Row ( weekdays , 3:15 p.m . E.S.T. , CBS ) . Scripted by the Bellamanns ' good friend Welbourn Kelley , the radio version of Kings Row has most of the old characters , the same Midwestern scene , but takes place in 1951 instead of the 1890s . The show seemed good enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-year absence . What listeners heard had a familiar sob-and-sacrifice ring : noble young Dr. Parris Mitchell outwitted villainous Fulmer Green , gently disengaged himself from beauteous Randy McHugh ( " Please . . . you 're making it hard for both of us " ) , was sweetly patient with his incurably ill wife Elise , and , to the accompaniment of vibrant organ " strains , " calmed a gun-toting hysteric . Supervisor Max Wylie , who has had an expert hand in such sudsy classics as Portia Faces Life , asked listeners to be patient , promised that soon " we 're going to do adult soap opera for the first time and get away with it .
