" The undersigned painters reject the monster national exhibition to be held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art next December . . . The choice of jurors . . . does not warrant any hope that a just proportion of advanced art will be included . We draw to the attention of these gentlemen the historical fact that , for roughly a hundred years , only advanced art has made any consequential contribution to civilization . . . " <P> This message , addressed to Metropolitan President Roland L. Redmond , appeared in Manhattan newspapers last week . Because many of the 28 painters and sculptors who signed it are abstract artists of advanced reputation , it was bound to raise a storm of controversy over Topic A in the art world today : How abstract can you get ? <P> For the moment , the Met maintained a dignified silence . It had some reason for compressing its lips ; the museum had only recently reversed its standoffish policy toward contemporary U.S. art and hoped to make 1950 an " American year " to be capped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December . <P> Not Knowing . What riled the abstractionists was that the seven juries chosen for the contemporary show were on the side of representational , i.e. , conservative , art . The juries were composed mostly of painters , and though some of those picked used moderately abstract techniques in their own work , there was only one out &; out abstractionist on the list . <P> Dean of the protesting group is 70-year-old Hans Hofmann , a compelling teacher for whom painting means " forming with color ... At the time of making a picture . I want not to know what I 'm doing ; a picture should be made with feeling , not with knowing ... A shape can be sad or gay , a line , delirious . " William Baziotes , who recently sold a painting called Dragon ( see cut ) to the <P> Met , also signed the letter . Less abstract than many in the group , he too works entirely from " feeling . " <P> Not Soaring . Among the most vocal of the signers was Ad Reinhardt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sit down to paint grass today , " says Reinhardt , " is just an illustrator . What we see is n't real ; everybody knows that . " Reinhardt 's pictures have nothing to do with anything except " the aesthetic experience , the painting experience . " <P> Though some critics and museums take such notions seriously , the Met is not likely to . Its witty director , Francis Henry Taylor , has never concealed his dislike of the moderns . " Instead of soaring like an eagle through the heavens as did his ancestors and looking down triumphantly upon the world beneath , " Taylor once wrote , " the contemporary artist has been reduced to the status of a flat-chested pelican , strutting upon the intellectual wastelands and beaches , content to take whatever nourishment he can from his own too meager breast .
