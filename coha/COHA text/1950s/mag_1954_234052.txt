In Detroit last week , one 12-year-old boy was fatally stabbed by another 12-year-old in an argument after a basketball game . A 17-year-old , stabbed a few days earlier in similar circumstances , is still recuperating . Police laid out exhibits of lethal weapons , many of them homemade , carried by adolescents , and the cry was promptly raised : " Let 's get tough with juvenile delinquents . " <P> From Ann Arbor , where University of Michigan officials are planning a separate center for the psychiatric treatment of adolescents , came both a defense of the nation 's youth and some pointed advice to parents . " Sensationalism notwithstanding , " said Psychiatrist James C. Flanagan , " it is simply not true that our adolescents are going to the dogs . " The way to keep more of them from getting into trouble , he believes , is not simply to snap at them , " Grow up ! " , but to give them constructive help in doing so . <P> Instead of blaming the adolescents themselves , or their parents* ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ) , or even the communities in which they live , Dr. Flanagan blames a breakdown in communication . " Too often , " he said , " Mom does n't talk to Pop , or Pop does n't talk to Mom , and neither talks to Junior . " What should they talk about ? For one thing , tension is a common ingredient in modern life , said Dr. Flanagan , so both parents and adolescents should talk about whatever is eating them . More specifically , youths in the limbo between childhood and adulthood want to know about these things , which he suggested as topics for family councils : <P> How to earn more money and thus feel more independent . <P> How to mix with adults without getting laughed at or kicked out . <P> Not only what the rules of conduct are , but the underlying reasons for them . <P> What it means to grow up sexually . In general , said Dr. Flanagan , adolescents tend to behave the way they think they are expected to . Thus , the more trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to justify them . <P> <P> * Last week in Rosenberg , Texas ( pop . 6,210 ) , Fernando Rodriguez , 35 , went to jail for six months because his eight-year-old son , a repeat offender but too young for prosecution , broke into a barbershop despite a previous judicial warning to the father ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) .
