Kiss Me Kate ( MGM ) might be subtitled " The Taming of the Show . " Based on the Broadway musical based on Shakespeare 's Taming of the Shrew , which was based on an Ariosto comedy based on an old folk tale , the picture is pretty far off any kind of base . <P> The Broadway show came excitingly to life because the audience felt itself transported through time to Shakespeare 's Padua . The film merely tries to carry the audience back to old Broadway , but somehow , at the final curtain , it is still esthetically blundering around somewhere on the far side of the George Washington Bridge . <P> The plot , a musical within a musical , with its noisily surreptitious shifts from onstage to off , appears just too heavy and elaborate a vehicle for the camera to prod along . Even so . if other performers had spread the wings of song as grandly as Howard Keel ( Petruchio ) , the picture might have been better . <P> Handsome Singer Keel , who appears to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood 's leading graduate of the Broadway school of musi-comedy , has not only a fine chesty baritone but the chest to go with it . As a blonde actress who plays a petulant Kate in a reddish wig . Kathryn Grayson pouts prettily but looks as though she is never quite sure who she is . <P> Ann Miller has a lovely pair of legs and tries hard to live up to them . Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore , as the collection agents for a prominent gambler , should bring down the house as two of the daintiest thugs who ever did a sentimental buck and wing at the annual picnic of Murder , Inc . The rest of the dances , however , seem overrehearsed-as though the dancers had long since stopped enjoying them . Only the music , some of the very best that Cole Porter ever wrote , is unimpaired ; the picture is almost worth seeing just to hear it again . <P> The Living Desert ( Walt Disney ) looks like the start of a grand-scale attempt to seduce Mother Nature with a motion-picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short sorties into the animal kingdom ( Beaver Valley , Seal Island , Water Birds , Olympic Elk , Bear Country ) , Walt Disney has apparently decided to invite the whole creation to go commercial . <P> In The Living Desert , his first full-length nature film , he modestly takes a mere quarter-million square miles for his province-the harsh and lovely world of the great American desert . Despite all the petty efforts to Disneyfy what the ages have dignified , The Living Desert remains a triumphantly beautiful film . <P> The beauty was caught by the sharp eyes of two fine cameramen , N. Paul Kenworthy Jr . and Robert H. Crandall , who roamed for over two years from New Mexico to Oregon , prospecting for pictorial gold . ( Sequences were also contributed by Stuart V. Jewell , Jack C. Couffer , Don Arlen and Tad Nichols . ) They brought back a pokeful of high-grade nuggets . <P> As the film starts , the audience looks into a mirage as into a giant 's dream ; next the camera traces the uncanny passage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody is looking . A little further on , the camera comes in close to watch two common tortoises , crowding the screen like prehistoric Panzers , churn into battle for possession of a female . Soon the audience is gliding along beside a rattler as he tracks a pocket mouse by tasting its footsteps with cold relish .
