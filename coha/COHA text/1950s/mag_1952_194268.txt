The Thief ( Harry Popkin ; United Artists ) takes its inspiration from the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words : it is a sound film in which no one ever speaks . The movie manages to get along quite well without dialogue because it is an uncomplicated chase thriller told with the camera on a simple physical and psychological level . The thief is a nuclear physicist ( Ray Milland ) employed by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission , where he is microfilming top secret documents for a foreign spy ring . When the FBI gets on his trail , he flees to New York , kills a Government agent in a chase to the top of the Empire State Building , and is about to escape overseas on a freighter when his conscience rather abruptly gets the better of him , and he voluntarily gives himself up to the FBI . <P> The spies , more or less naturally , operate behind a wall of silence : they communicate with each other by telephonic signals and by notes written on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth is when he breaks down and sobs during the strain of the chase . But though . And it has all sorts of literal sound effects : the click of a microfilm camera , the rustle of papers , the jangle of telephones , the blare of radios , opening &; closing doors . Unfortunately , Director Russell Rouse ( who also co-authored the screenplay with Producer Clarence Greene ) has not used his sound track , or his camera , in a particularly imaginative way . The Thief is an interesting stunt and a fairly exciting thriller . But in telling its story visually , it merely proves what has been obvious ever since sound came to the screen : most movies talk far too much . <P> The Fourposter ( Stanley Kramer ; Columbia ) is unique for being a movie with only two characters and one set . The picture traces the milestones of a marriage from the vantage point of a bedchamber in a Manhattan brownstone : the turn-of-the-century wedding night ; the arrival of the first baby ; the crisis over the other woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter 's wedding in the jazz-mad ' 20s ; the husband ( Rex Harrison ) reliving the high spots of the marriage with the vision of his departed wife ( Lilli Palmer ) just before he , too , dies . <P> Jan de Hartog 's 1951 comedy-drama , * on which the picture is based , was a theatrical tour de force that capitalized on the physical limitations of the stage . But on the expansive screen , it becomes a motion picture with a minimum of motion and a maximum of sugary sentiment . The result is a fourposter that often creaks and sags . England 's suave Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer , his real-life wife , play their parts smoothly , though they sometimes seem over-sophisticated for the homey couple they are supposed to be . The picture owes nothing to the stage original for its outstanding feature : a gaily animated cartoon that bridges sequences , depicting the changing world outside the bedroom .
