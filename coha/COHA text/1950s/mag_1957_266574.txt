In the old days when Europe 's elite took the cure at Baden-Baden , the spa 's fashionable hotels were equipped to handle all comers , no matter how whimsical or wellborn . But in these days , when Baden-Baden 's hotelkeepers concentrate on the methodical ranks of Germany 's industrial aristocracy , who make their bookings well in advance , no one was quite prepared for the telephone call that came from the West German protocol office . <P> It was an urgent request for bookings . A " high-ranking personality from the Middle East , " name top secret , said a voice on the other end of the line , was planning to drop in at Baden-Baden with a few friends and relatives . " He wants , " the voice went on , " a large hotel for himself , plus accommodations in other hotels-a total of about 90 beds-by next Tuesday . " <P> <P> Profitable Inconvenience . Willy Brennecke , general manager of the dignified old ( 90 years ) Schloss-Hotel Hahnhof , agreed to evict his regular guests to make room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saud . It would be inconvenient , but inconveniences could be tolerated in Baden-Baden for a party prepared to pay $10,000 a day . While Willy mobilized , other Baden-Baden innkeepers embarked on the difficult task of persuading their own guests to double up in bathless bedrooms in order to take care of the princely overflow . <P> When the 32 Saudi royal visitors ( all male ) , their aides , and seven tons of their luggage at last arrived in a motorcade of 50 cars and trucks escorted by screaming German police cars , Baden-Baden was ready . A Saudi Arabian flag had even been found tucked away in the spa director 's attic and streamed triumphantly in the breeze beside a palm tree hurriedly erected in the hotel park . King Saud , a bit testy from the rheumatic pains which had brought him to the spa , was shown his own bed and told that it had once been slept in by the Queen of Persia . " Too soft , " he snapped . That night he rushed through a splendiferous eight-course dinner in just 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table when he did , finished or not . <P> Ten Cents a Point . In the days that followed , while the King took the waters , he was asked his every wish . Music ? He liked Carmen and Ada . The local symphony changed its program and saved a row of seats . But on the appointed night , the King decided to stay home instead , so fascinated was he by the Japanese magician who had been brought in to amuse his youngest sons while he was at the concert . <P> The older princes , afraid to partake of the joys of the casino while King Saud was around , spent their time in their hotel rooms playing gin rummy and canasta at 10 a point . As they played , a shapely maid dropped around to deliver a cake . In less than a minute , she was back down in the hotel lobby , aflame with blushes . " The big one with the beard , " she stammered , " he told me to take off my sweater . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel managers , " why there are no women in the party . I hope there wo n't be any trouble . "
