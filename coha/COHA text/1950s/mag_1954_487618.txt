Frank O'Connor writes not of Irish poor or Irish pixies but Irish people , and very human people too . Nor does he . depend on the tinkle of brogue , although some of his Gaelicisms are delightful . Possessed of the One essential ability for any short-story craftsman  --  the ability to change mood and manner to suit the immediate literary target ? O'Connor evokes a many-faceted culture Here are the city and village , the eccentric and the orthodox , the middle-class sitting-room and the pub , all woven together in dynamic patterns . O'Connor with his short stories achieves , as few but the most experimental novels can do , a panoramic recreation of life within but transcending a particular society , and this from different points of reference . He will focus one tale on an aging Don Juan , another on a tragi-comic adolescent , and another on the violence of revolution . Each balances against the others , and all have pungency and life The net effect is that of a mosaic  --  bright and dark bits of fiction which join together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - O'Connor is never dull ; he is honest enough to acknowledge that " everyday " life has its charm and tragedy , and artist enough to recreate both beautifully There can be no doubt that he is one of the ablest praCtitioners of the short story now working . opiniOn has not substantially altered , I am inclined to speak of the play in much more indulgent teams . The reason for this change is that in London I saw it as a play disassociated from any specific theater environment , - whereas in New York I regard it , for all its intrinsic faults , as superior to most of the stage entertainment offered this season . " The Living Room " is in large measure an expression of faith by an adult and literate man . Most of our plays at present are hardly an expression of anything they are contrivances for kids . Though it resembles realistic drama , " The Living Room " is essentially a morality play Its morality may dismay many Americans and be incomprehensible to others , but we should not forget that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of mind of many intelligent people all over the Western world . The house of which the living room is the center is at once a strange London home in which a disabled priest and his elderly maiden sisters live and an oblique symbol for the Catholic church . It was a great house once , but the two sisters , one good-hearted , credulous , and extremely simple-minded , the other narrow and bigoted with a terrible dread of death , have gradually turned it into a house of fear . The sisters have locked all the rooms where anyone has died until now but one living room remains , so cramped that it adjoins the only lavatory on the premises . Young life appears in the person of a niece who has come from a convent school and who , on the death of her mother , has become the ward of the aunts and uncle who dwell in the old house . The girl has fallen in love with a married man whose wife refuses him a divorce One aunt is not allowed to understand what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the affair , the priest tries to intercede humanely . The girl is tortured by the pain of hurting her lover 's wife . Unable to be convinced by the priest 's plea that she ren  --  unce her love and wait for God 's he-ling  --  for the godly in this household are people who have turned their eyes from reality  --  she commits suicide . The purport of this story is to tell us first that we can not not suffer in life , that we must trust in some metaphysical justification for our suffering or we can not live , and that neither a dry rationalism nor an empty piety can sustain us in our common dilemma The answer must lie in a faith beyond logic and a church open to all the contradictions that reality presents . Whether one considers the play 's rnesDecember 4 , 1954 sage too pessimistic or too special in its orientation ? Americans live in a predominantly activist and secular-minded atmosphere  --  the fact remains that Greene here touches many sensitive spots in the consciousness of any mature person 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is creative spontaneity , a sense of direct experience the eloquence of original emotion . The play is constricted by a kind of shrewd though earnest literary diplomacy , calculated to satisfy the demands of the author 's various interests ? to present an effective show , a disturbing demonstration and a reasonable statement of his beliefs . The production suffers here as it did in London by being directed with too sharp an efficiency , which makes it more melodramatically compelling than moving . Still , the local company , headed by Barbara Bel Geddes and Walter Fitzgerald , is a very good one , and the total performance entirely creditable . " WEDDING BREAKFAST " by Theodore Reeves ( Forty-eighth Street Theater ) is a New York idyl . Lost in the great , noisy , machine-made maze of our city , good little people are still worried by the simplest and most basic things , such as the problem of getting married . Some find it difficult to get married because they are poor and would like to 6e-married in furnishings of their own choosing , some run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt and even more subtly because they are looking for a mate above the commonplace . Out of this " baby " material Reeves has written a serio-comic play which is tender and sweet , charmingly humorous , and with a greater amount of truthful observation than one might at first suspect There are obstacles in the author 's way . Sometimes his writing is too archly mannered in the vein of the Arthur Kober dialect , which is an invented rather than a true speech Then , too , the older - sister , who is the pivot of the play 's story , is not a wholly realized character . This girl , being " college-'educated " in a milieu where that estate is held in peculiar esteem , feels impelled to shape her prospective husband to a standardized version of the " socially acceptable " professional man who can recognize a Picasso when he sees one and knows what chamber music is . Such a girl is not an uncommon type and has her pathos , but our audience , which has its , own brand of snobbishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwritten law of the American theater that a play 's leading character must be sympathetic  --  or entirely horrible I The author therefore feels obliged to water the girl clOwn so that her blemish seems a minor and temporary quirk rather than a fatal defect . The result is something indecisive but troublesome in a story that at the outset seems to have been created for nothing but amusement. , This difficulty might possibly have been resolved if the play had been staged more poetically  --  the heavy literalness of the set is a grave directorial error  --  with the four lonely figures of the play seen as bright but pathetic midges of humanity lost in the dark night of the vast urban world which A T A RECENT concert the Concert Society of New York had Virgil Thomson conduct a small orchestra and vocal soloists in the first New York performance of Satie 's " Socrate , " which Thomson has frequently spoken of out of deep devotion . It is curious that not even the League of Composers should have presented this famous work here before ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to hear it . Hearing it at last I found it quite unimpressive in its operation as a work of art , but interesting as the model for Thomson 's operation in his own vocal pieces earlier in the concert , which I found more impressive than Satie 's . That is , in Thomson 's Stabat Mater ( 1932 ) for soprano and string quartet and his Four Songs to Poems of Thomas Campion ( 1951 ) for mezzo-soprano and a trio of harp , viola , and clarinet I heard a voice part that could be described by the terms he uses for Satie 's ? " fluid , conversational , ultra-sensitive , dominates them but in which their innermost souls stand somewhat apart . The play would then be less conventionally funny but ultimately more poignant . Lacking such an approach the play may strike some as too light for its seriousness , too complex for its comedy . The acting is exemplary . Lee Grant in the most difficult part , Virginia Vincent , Harvey Lembeck , Anthony Franciosa are all fine . Herman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he tends to force his actors into a meticulousness which has the virtue of clarity but the vice of hypertension . Despite these reservations " Wedding Breakfast " has a kind of delicacy , a thin but telling stroke in character delineation , and a not unV ? Tholesome sentimentality in regard to the ordinary people around us  --  whom , with our taste for the unusual and our blindness to the normal , we almost invariably overlook . ments to be more freshly and imaginatively inventive , more attractive , and more expressively effective than Satie 's . The pieces were excellently performed ? the Stabat Mater by Phyllis Curtin and the Guilet Quartet , the Campion , songs by Alice Howland and a trio comprising Edward Vito ; . Emanuel Vardi , and Robert McGinnis , and " Socrate " by the two singers and the orchestra . Thomson also conducted Bach 's Suite No. 2 , with Julius Baker as ' flute soloist , and Mozart 's Symphony K.319 ; and my guess is that he supplied the excellent tempos , general style , and phrasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former NBC Symphony  --  provided the beautiful tone , . precision , and finish . In recent years Thomson has combined journalism with an increasing amount of concert activity ; and one learned to anticipate , in the SUnday article about a university chorus and orchestra in some remote place , the inevitable " In a performance of this writer 's cantata . . . . " His Concert Society appearance signalized his complete substitution of concert*activity for journalism for the purposes of earning a liv . ing and furthering his career as a composer . And since an enlightened public is as important in music as in politics , Thomson 's departure from the New York Herald Tribune is a disaster . He could be irresponsible , he could be nonsensical , in recent years he was increasingly bored and wrote more than ever about what he imagined rather than what he heard ; but he had the equipment of critical perception that is the one essential in criticism , and when it was allowed to operate on what was before him it produced the only newspaper criticism of Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equipment ; and now there is no one .
