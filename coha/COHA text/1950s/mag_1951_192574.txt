Seltzer on Right &; Wrong <P> Sir : If ever the American public were given a heaping dish of nourishing food for thought , it was served up in your Aug. 27 reprint of Louis B. Seltzer 's editorial in the Cleveland - Press . <P> For this down-to-earth piece of writing and timely document of good common sense , which should be digested by every adult in these United States , I nominate Seltzer as TIME 'S 1951 " Man of the Year . " BEN F. HOLZMAN Beverly Hills , Calif . <P> Sir : . . . Our country needs more men like Seltzer . MABEL I. MORRISON Chicago <P> Sir : . . . In a sentence : Babbittry triumphs over Christianity . . . We are not likely to be any different , as long as students only want to know , and schools teach , the shortest way to a buck . Idealism has replaced sex as the forbidden topic of conversation . J. H. SUMMERELL Detroit <P> Sir : . . . This country is suffering from malnutrition of the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality are not going to get it back on the road to recovery . Our too many religious cooks have added so many man-made seasonings and garnishes to the original all-nourishing Christianity that we are in the stew instead of its being in us . . . MRS . CHARLES R. ALLERS JR . Pittsburgh <P> Sir : . . . It is perhaps not proper for me to air any criticism after having been in this country for only nine months but what strikes me most are the manners &; morals of young people ( 5 to 25 ) here . . . <P> An alarming portion of young people in Cleveland ( where I live ) seem rude , insolent and very vague about what is right or wrong . This includes seemingly trivial things : shouting at people walking by , rude jokes about girls , exaggerated " sex-interest , " exaggerated " money-consciousness , " and disinterest in anything worthier than crime novels , gangster films and certain magazines . . . ADOLF A. PERLES Cleveland <P> Sir : . . . Many of our citizens do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness , and seek to assuage their discontent and to escape their confusion in movies , radio , TV , books and so forth . The modern housewife is content to buy an electric mixer to mix her box cake and to open some cans , in preference to creating an appetizing meal . Her husband argues with his boss for shorter working hours and more pay , and expects the Government or anyone other than himself to make his life secure and comfortable . . . MARY ANNE HAYES Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> Sir : " Ca n't we tell right from wrong ? " Asks a question . . . but it does not furnish the answer . . . <P> The answer was given more than 19 centuries ago , when Jesus Christ declared the supreme importance of spiritual things , and the relative unimportance of what is called material success . . . RAY BROWN Ottawa , Canada <P> Advice from Abroad <P> Sir : I , for one , am tired of hearing and reading about the nation 's declining morals . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earnestness with which we have been arguing about the lives and jobs of others .
