All diseases may be by sure means prevented or cured not excepting even that of age , and our lives lengthened at pleasure beyond the antediluvian standard . - Benjamin Franklin , 1780 <P> One doctor who believes that Franklin 's dictum can come true is Manhattan 's famed Psychosomaticist Flanders Dunbar . But how ? It occurred to her that one way to find out was to study men and women who have defied the aging process by living a hundred years or more , see what had made them tick so long . By questionnaire and personal interviews , Dr. Dunbar and her collaborators quizzed some 300 oldsters , 20% of all the living white centenarians born in the U.S. ( excluding others because of the difficulty of confirming birth records ) . Last week , before the Third Congress of the International Association of Gerontology in London , petite Dr. Dunbar reported what she had learned . Among her findings : <P> &gt; " The highest percentage of centenarians is in parts of the country where the stress and strain of living are supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston to Charleston and along the Mississippi , and not in such havens for the aging as California or Florida . <P> <P> &gt; " They are slightly above the average income level . . . Few are very rich or very poor . " <P> &gt; " Ninety-eight percent have been married , and about 30% have been married more than once , usually as the result of widowhood rather than divorce . . . Their record for children is startlingly above the usual average of 1.6 . . . It is 4.0 . " <P> " A Different Kind . " Nearly all the centenarians had always slept well and enjoyed good health . Asked " about how many days of your life have you spent in bed ? Give reasons , " one old lady crossed out the " about " and wrote : " Exactly 45 days . Reason , nine children . " Adds Dr. Dunbar : " Centenarians , as contrasted with sufferers from ' diseases of old age , ' appear to be a different kind of human being . " Most have reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many have a number of their own teeth . <P> <P> As to their emotional makeup , Dr. Dunbar reported : " Centenarians show little tendency toward elation or depression , but they are optimists according to the definition , ' one who believes the future to be still uncertain ' . . . They show little need to dominate . They are willing to live and let live . They have many friends and a good sense of humor , and they spend little time prating about ' the good old days . ' They are receptive to change . . . and often talk as though they expect to be around for many years . " <P> Underlying this relaxed and healthy emotional attitude , Dr. Dunbar saw one factor as most important : " Centenarians have contrived to avoid or navigate the dangerous age range from 50 to 70 " - which she compared to adolescence because of the severity of the changes in the individual 's body and in his relationship to the outside world . " The individual beginning his second half-century of living is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Centenarians , having " navigated " this period successfully , keep not only an interest in sex but also their potency .
