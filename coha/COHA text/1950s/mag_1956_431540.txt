 | THE NEXT POPE A leading Italian journalist with close Vatican connections examines the prospects of the present major candidates .. . and explains why an American Cardinal is not likely to be elected . T H E advanced age and fragile health of Pope Pius XII are now confronting the cardinals of the Roman Catholic church with an inescapable duty . They must soon choose one of their own number as his successor . This responsibility is more complex than most people ? including devout Catholics ? can easily realize . It will affect not only the Church , but millions outside of its ministry , and to some degree the course of history in our time . Yet the decision is hedged by many restraints of precedent and policy , so that it is already clear that the choice will be limited to a handful of men , whose qualifications and characteristics can be listed with considerable precision . To understand what kind of man will be selected as the next Holy Father , and the process by which he will be chosen , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do . His job is , naturally , unique ; and for no two Popes is it ever quite the same . In these times of rapid change millions of people ? non-Catholics as well as Catholics ? take comfort in thinking that the Holy Roman Church never changes . In reality , it is continually changing , but with a motion so subtle that you can see it only when you compare today 's Church with yesterday 's . Even with respect to fundamental dogmas and rites , there is a slow shift of emphasis , priority , and interest . Few Catholics nowadays would die for matters which were once considered burning issues ? such as the bestowing of indulgences or the authenticity of bones of saints ? but many Churchmen and ordinary Christians in our time have faced jail , torture , and death in defense of principles which might have seemed irrelevant to our forefathers . The evolution of ecclesiastical style is an obvious example . In some places the Church has abandoned the traditional art of the past in order to appeal in contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are modified and ancient costumes revived . European priests , for instance , began to wear the soutane outside the performance of their offices only in 1848 , and Cardinals shortened their red silk trains quite recently . Forgotten music , liturgies , and habits may be exhumed ; long and elaborate ceremonies may be shortened . Some rites , such as the exorcism of devils , no longer are in great demand . Pius XII himself has established Sunday afternoon Hass , revolutionized the schedule for Easter ceremonies , and suggested more modern garb for certain orders of nuns . Thus , anchored to her immutable principles ,  | the Church maintains an agility and capacity for adaptation surprising in so old an organization . ( The Vatican adopted microphones and amplifiers before the House of Commons , the typewriter before the Foreign Office , and abolished carriages and horses before the House of Savoy . ) The Church manages to be , therefore , modern and ancient at the same time . In reality most of these changes can be compared to an oarsman rowing against the stream : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same place . Above all , the Vatican keeps a vigilant eye on political trends , so as to preserve the Church 's power and liberty of action at all costs . Only superficial observers believe that the Holy See fights , iii turn , for the " divine right of Kings , " for " private initiative and property , " or for " liberty and democracy . " In reality the Church fights only for itself and for the rights of its faithful . All these changes ? the petty and superficial as well as the vital and decisive ? depend almost exclusively on the decisions of one man , His Holiness the Pope . He is not a ceremonial figurehead , akin to a constitutional sovereign . He does not , as a general or the president of an international company may do , merely consecrate with his signature his staff 's decisions . He has a real and absolute power which he must exercise to keep the Church functioning . All matters come to a head at his desk . He writes most of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and debates all issues . And as Popes are ? by the very nature of things ? very old men , the thoughts which inspire their actions inevitably are old men 's thoughts , formed and crystallized a generation earlier . They feel most strongly on matters which seemed vital to them thirty or forty years before . Their Pontificates are rarely marked by sudden and unforeseen changes . Real and far-reaching revolutions happen only at their deaths ( and then only sometimes ) . When a new Pope and a new staff take over , their ideas are thirty or forty years younger than their predecessors ' ? although always thirty or forty years older than those of the bolder Catholic thinkers of the day . To these arrangements the Church owes her continuous and cautious progress . It is usually quicker ( although always firmly tied to precedents and tradition ) at the beginning of a new Pontificate , and gradually slows down as the Holy Father 's age advances . For all these reasons , in these troubled times , when the Pope is past eighty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers of power are transforming society , observers in the Vatican naturally are speculating on whit is Cardinal has the best chance to be the next Pope . On his ideas , mental habits , character . energy , authority , and past experiences depends the stand the Church will take on the problemof the world . And the Pope 's stand has greater significance today than in past ages for at least two obvious reasons : the importance of the Catholics in the United States is expanding ; and the Catholics ' secret resistance in the satellite countries of Eastern Europe is becoming firmer . CAESAR 'S OWN F R O y f the eighteenth century till today . the power of the Church has been growing . more often through the force of events than through the will of the Popes and the scheming of Vatican Monsignori . The gulf between the State and religion , between secular and religious life , has deepened . In the old days , the two worlds were confused in reality , but even more in the minds and faith of sovereigns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within moral limits defined by the Church : a crime was at the same time an offense against the King and God . jurisdictions overlapped . Sometimes the State enforced religious norms with its secular authority and sometimes the clergy undertook tasks which today are considered strictly Caesar 's own ? such as keeping birth and death registers , the education of the young , or the construction of hospitals . This intimacy was not always advantageous to the Church of Rome . Until the beginning of the nineteenth century , local churches maintained a strong pride in their autonomy on many matters . autonomy due in part to the local church 's loyalty to its national sovereign . With the American and French revolutions and the growth of liberal ideas , the division hetween Church and State widened , and paradoxically , each power gained in the split . The State became stronger and more centralized . The King , the " amatissimus /dins , " or " most loved son " of the Holy Father , anointed with hole oil . yielded power to his constitutional government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose interests were merely spiritual and moral , with practically no influence in the field of politics . The local churches were abandoned by liberal governments to the exclusive command of the Pope . Almost all interference of secular authorities in the affairs and decisions of the Church ceased .  | At the Council of 1870 , for instance , for the first time , Catholic kings and princes were not officially represented and not one of them tried to prevent the proclamation of the dogma of the Pope 's infallibility , to which many were opposed . The last attempt at using a century-old privilege was made by the Emperer of Austria , Franz Joseph . At the 1903 Conclave , which elected Pius X , he ordered the Archbishop of Prague to veto the candidacy of Cardinal Rampolla , then Secretary of State . The Vatican was angry about that for a long time . Even now , Cardinals must swear , as they enter the Conclave , not to accept vetoes or orders from outside . After the separation of Church and State , the next great boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the loss of its temporal power . Of ourse , Pope Pius IX protested strongly when the Italian army invaded his States and , when they entered Rome through a breach in the walls , he locked himself up in the Vatican as a " prisoner " and excommunicated the " Usurper , " Victor Emmanuel II . On the other hand , he was relieved of weighty responsibilities which had little to do with the interests of the Church : the liberal patriots ' hatred of the Papal police ; the criticisms of his government 's misrule and the backward conditions in which his people lived . He was also infinitely less vulnerable . He was no longer a sovereign like others , whose decisions could be forced by defeating his armies in the field , by sinking his ships , or by capturing and sacking his cities . He could no longer be arrested and carried away to faraway capitals , to sign treaties under duress . The Holy Father how is unreachable , surrounded by Italian territory and unseizable , a purely spiritual power . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weight in international affairs , he would at best wield an influence inferior to Belgium 's or the Netherlands ' . Unarmed , he can take on any enemy and , if given enough time , he may even defeat him . As " Their Catholic Majesties , " the kings of the great Catholic nations , gradually lost their authority , the Holy See began cultivating more and more intimate relations with the new sovereigns , the new sources of power ? the voting sses . In all of Europe , at the end of the last ntury , Catholic parties sprang up and slowly quired experience , following , and influence , until now , more than a half-century later , they e in power in Germany and in Italy , and exercise the balance of power in France , the Netherlands , and elsewhere . It must be noted that all this is not the result of scheming by a Vatican brain trust . Often this power has arisen from the slow pressure of circumstances on the Catholic masses , with inevitable repercussions on the hierarchy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression in Vatican policy . It is always difficult to point to the source of any one decision . Ideas are in the air much before they become policy . Gradually , in a hundred years or so , the Church , which condemned democratic principles when they seemed to threaten its security , has become the champion of Western liberties . For now universal suffrage can be considered one of the main sources of its strength , the new " Protector of the Faith . " The contemporary shift of emphasis in the Church from the purely theological to more spiritual , social , and moral issues , has also contributed to drawing the Holy Father away from the dreary controversies of the past . The " whore of Babylon " horrifies Protestants less and less . The Anglican minister preaching in Rome to his British flock simply and correctly calls Pius XI1 , " the Bishop of this city . " Many people still smilingly deplore some Catholic habits ? the veneration of some Saints and uncertain relics , the excessive cult of Mary , the Byzantine pomp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential . What seems important , today , is the spiritual leadership which the Church has gradually offered to all people . Thanks to its experience , its knowledge of history and the human soul , and especially to its detachment from earthly matters , the Catholic faith has been kept intact , primitive , deep , and irrational . At every turning point of Western history , from 1914 till today , a large body of believers and non-believers alike have hoped that the Pope 's words would point to the right path , identifying the Good which must be defended and the Evil which must be fought . This new moral status of the Vatican among nonCatholics has come about often through the efforts of its enemies , and sometimes in spite of its own . Here is one more proof , according to the faithful , that an invisible hand is really piloting Peter 's Boat on a course which mortal men can not fathom . THE POLITICAL POPES W H 0 , then , will be the next Pope , what will be his " revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tomor-row ? A A recent Vatican rule-of-thumb roughly classifies the latest Popes as either " religious " or   " political " and claims that the two alternate on the throne . In the early years of this century , " political " Pius X was so " religious " that he is now a saint , and Benedict XV is mainly remembered for his diplomatic efforts to end the first world war . But since their time , was Pius XI only " religious " when he bravely faced the rise of totalitarian regimes in Italy and Germany ? It must be noted that the " political " Pope often works hard at organizational problems , to revive the lagging faith of his flock , since his force also depends on the Catholics ' cohesion and loyalty , while the " religious " Pope 's political decisions often are more intransigent and firm , dictated as they are not by the arts of diplomacy but by the fervent consciousness of a divine mission . Pius XI I , who was elected in 1939 , is without doubt a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , never ruled over a diocese or archdiocese , knows only by hearsay the trying difficulties of caring for one 's own flock , or the administrative problems of a Bishop . He followed a brilliant diplomatic career to the top . His intimate knowledge of international affairs , foreign countries and languages , Church political precedents and traditions , together with his faith , armed him for the tragic times of his Pontificate and allowed him to fill a role of moral arbiter among nations . On paper , therefore , the next Pope will have to be " religious , " not because the lost Eminent Cardinals who sit in Conclave will be obliged to confirm the rule-of-thumb tradition , but because , objectively , the Church , after so many years of international convulsions , can do with some housekeeping . The organization needs to be looked after ; technical problems must be solved ; seminaries , schools , universities , need to be taken care of . The heavy tasks of Pius XII 's Pontificate , his advancing age , his uncertain health have of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered secondary in times of war and international danger ? all the attention they deserve . Sometimes bishops who arrive in Rome for their ad liming visits , once every five years at least , can not be received by His Holiness . This does not mean , of course , that the next Pope , if " religious , " will not have to face urgent political problems , but that he will have to cope with them not only by means of pronouncements and letters and encyclicals , but also by strengthening organization and discipline . Will he be a foreign Pope ? Theoretically nothing would stand in the way of the election of a non-Italian . Pius XII is said to consider it a desirable possibility . On Christmas Day , 1916 , MAGAZINE during the ceremony for the creation of new Cardinals , he said : " The Church is Mother , Sancta Mater Ecclesia , a true Mother , the Mother of all nations and of all peoples as well as the Mother of each individual man , and precisely because she is Mother , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor can she belong to one people more than to another , but she must belong to all equally . . . . Delicate contemporary conditions require a particular care and protection of the supranational and indivisible quality of the Church . " Pius XII increased the ratio of non-Italians to Italians in the College of Cardinals from halfand-half to two-thirds foreigners and one-third Italians , for the first time in history . He recognizes the natural desire of foreign Churches to see their own men reach the highest rank , so that the new Pope can bring to the government of the institution a specific knowledge of his part of the world . Foreign Catholics may realize that an Italian monopoly was justified in other ages , when news circulated slowly ; when few foreign Cardinals managed to know each other or the bureaucracy of the Vatican well , while the Italian Cardinals had continuous contacts among themselves , in Rome or within a few clays ' travel by chaise . But inevitably , comparisons are made today between the Catholic Church and other international bodies , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sonictimes by rotation , sometimes even by obligatory alphabetical rotation . A FOREIGN POPE ? T H E problems of the Church , foreign Catholics point out , are no longer , as in the past . exclusively European and Italian , but worldwide ; the administration no longer disposes modest revenues , but rather of vast sums of money in all currencies : the faithful are now spread ou : through the two hemispheres and are no long ( r concentrated in Western Europe . The Chun ii of the United States , which was run like a missionary church in the colonies until 1908. is today one of the most numerous , flourishing wealthy , aggressive , and influential . How then can the Italians be regarded as having exclusively the experience and knowledge of nations and languages necessary to pilot Peter 's Boat through the difficulties and increased responsibilities of the next few years and decades ? Most arguments in favor of a foreign Pope rightly rest on the analogy between the Church  | and other international organizations . But e analogy is somewhat misleading , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Italians never had a right to the papal throne and never claimed to ave . From all Conclaves ? since the death of Adrian VI , of Utrecht , who reigned one year in 1522 and was the last of his kind to be elected a loreign Cardinal might have emerged as supreme Pontiff . If this has not happened , is not because of nationalistic prejudices . The ry idea of nationalism is relatively recent , born the end of the eighteenth century and the inning of the nineteenth , with the French evolution and the Napoleonic Wars , when salty to one 's Prince was slowly replaced by salty to one 's country . Then , of course , until 80 there was no Italian state , which came into tug mainly in opposition to the Church . Tian nationalism always had a strong anticlerical character and the Church was fundamentally anti-nationalist in Italy . For centuries country was divided into many small principalities , kingdoms , and dukedoms , each jealous d distrustful of the others . It was sometimes me likely that a Tuscan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piedmontese or Venetian . Why , then , has the Pope always been Italian ? There is an old Vatican saying : It takes the Italians to select the candidate , takes the foreigners to make him Pope . " Rarely do the Italians ever agree at first on c particular name ; and among the first two three that emerge it is often the foreign vote at is decisive . The strength of the foreigners been increased by the new ratio in the Colof Cardinals and the new voting rules established by Pius XII Now a vote of twothirds of the total plus two is necessary to t a Pope , and no longer two-thirds plus The candidate is usually Italian , mainly cause the Italians know each other and n rum the central machinery of the Church 's organization . I believe that if , some clay , the tuber of foreign Cardinals were increased and Pope should necessarily have to be one of Ili , he would still be chosen from the " Roman " or " Italian " Cardinals ? that is , from ' se whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of the Church 's government , its habits , tendencies , traditions , problems , and men . There are other reasons . When Europe was by the rivalries of the great powers ? Germany , Austria , France , and England ? the Pope clearly never could have belonged to one of these , just as today the Secretary General of the United Nations has never been a citizen of one of the great powers . For centuries Italy has been a no man 's land , the theater for other people 's battles , weak , undefended , but rich with men of talent , the ideal birthplace for a Pope . Often he was also born in the Papal States . With the creation of the Kingdom of Italy , the situation did not change . No Italian Cardinal from 1870 to the Concordat of 1929 , as I said above , could be suspected of favoring the government that had fought and defeated the Papacy , or the King who sat in the Pope 's old palace on the Ouirinale Hill . With the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place among second-rate powers , with no special ambitions , unable and unwilling to follow a vigorous and energetic foreign policy of her own making . Because of great power conflicts , then , a Pope can not be American , Soviet Russian , French , German , British , or Chinese . He could , nevertheless , be Portuguese , Austrian , Dutch , Belgian , South or Central American , Armenian , Greek of the Catholic rite , Chaldean , or Maronite . The advantages of his being Italian are , however , many . The machinery of the Church has been constructed by the genius of his race : its very defects and dualities are the national ones . The administration of Vatican City and other possessions is in Italian hands , the Church Bureaucracy is Italian , and it is an advantage to have a Pope who speaks the language and understands the local mental habits . Italians are furthermore among the few ecclesiastics educated entirely to divest themselves of their national qualities and consider all questions from a supranational point of view . Foreign prelates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities , have not always shown the necessary prudence , objectivity , patience , and elasticity . Among Italians , it takes them time to learn new ways and forget the old , and even then they never entirely transform themselves . As Bernard Wall says , in his book Report on the Vatican : The installation of a foreign Pope today would put a strain on the Vatican machinery even were he as Italian-trained and Italianspeaking as the . Armenian Cardinal Agagianian . . . . The world has become accustomed to Italian Popes , a change would arouse as much ill Feeling as it could possibly solve , and , above all , it would have the , to the Vatican , disadvantage of being a change .  | The battle the Church is waging today has been erroneously called " the battle against Communism . " In reality the Church fights materialism , hedonism , relativism , atheism , and rationalism in the modern world , tendencies which are at least two or three centuries old and which , according to Catholic thinking , have begotten Communism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous threat to the Church since the barbarian invasions . It is , at the same time , a healthy challenge . The Western world sees the Catholic Church as a great depository of its ultimate beliefs . It carries , like a river , not only its own dogmas and principles but , at the same time , the remains of all the civilizations which went to make our own , Paul and Plato , Augustine and Aristotle , Thomas and Thales . The force the Church uses in this battle is flexible and rigid , ancient and modern , dispersed and centralized . It is based on faith , on infinite patience , on the numbers of the believers , their discipline , their organizations , and their relative political weight in the respective countries where they live . Today the Church fights first of all in Italy itself , seat of the Papacy . A Communist Italy would provoke a revolution in the Vatican practically without precedent . The central Church government could undoubtedly function elsewhere but could it function as efficiently far from the humus which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously become the foremost , for geographical and moral reasons , of all the Church 's political problems . How can the Church defeat its enemies in distant countries if it can not be sure of the results of municipal elections in Rome itself ? The Church is at present doing very well in Italy . Since the banishment of the last King of the House of Savoy , and the foundation of the Republic in 1945 , the Pope has become the last representative of the Italian sovereigns of 1859 on a throne . The President of the Republic , Giovanni Gronchi , is a Christian Democrat . The country is governed by Catholics , whose party is the largest . Catholics are gradually occupying some of the economic key positions ( about half of the industries , banks , and public utilities in Italy are state-owned ) . They are more and more important in cultural life , education , publishing , and the cinema , tactfully controlling the radio , television , some popular magazines , newspapers , and other mass-communication media . Their conquest has been greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only institution and the on : . organization that could save the country from a Marxist totalitarian regime . CANDIDATES AND DARK HORSES TH E Italian experiment is , of course , difficult and delicate . It is the test of seventy years of theoretical speculations and debates . to find Catholic answers to contemporary problems and to insert Catholic tradition in the mass democracies of today . A mistake could endanger it . It is also the test of the efficiency of the Church 's new political relations with the soxereign People . The instruments of this alliance are not secret and subtle negotiations with crowned heads , letters in Latin , or the bestowing of Vatican Orders , as in the old days , but the skillful use of modern means of mass propaganda . Can that religious faith which permeated the secular life of the past through the moral scruples of Princes and their ministers , manage to permeate the secular life of today ? The possibilities of such an experiment are far-reaching In the Vatican nobody ignores them , but the pace is unhurried ; events proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , a foreign Pope follow Italian political life intimately enough and intervene at the right time with the necessary light touch , whenever the interests of the Church are at stake : If the next Pope were to be a foreigner , most experts agree that he would be the Armenian , Gregory Peter XV Cardinal Agagianian , Pattiarch of Cilicia , who is sixty-one years old . Born at Akhaltzikhe in the Caucasus , not from Tiflis , Stalin 's birthplace , he was sent t Rome as a child of ten , so young that teacher at the College of Propaganda Fide wanted c , send him back . He was presented among other pupils of the College to Pius X , who , when told . the boy was to be returned home , said : " No . Do n't send him away . He will render great services to the Church . " The words . could be prophetic ; Pius X is a Saint . Agagianian has traveled all over the world to visit Armenian communities ; he lived in France , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East , where most of his floc k live . He speaks Russian , French , English , Greek . Armenian , and Italian with a slight Roma : : accent . His mother and brothers are in th ; Soviet Union and , until a few years ago , sell : him news through the Soviet consulate in Beiru : He-has had no letters now for a long time . The  | Soviet press and radio attack him occasionally . e is a professor at the Athenaeum of the Cole of Propaganda Fide , with many friends the Roman Curia and no known enemy . He could be a " political " Pope , useful for his knowledge of the Middle East , especially adapted an eventual resumption of relations between e Vatican and Russia and with the Orthodox church , if an opportunity arose . In his favor also his fatherly and majestic appearance , enaced by a well-combed beard . Against him is e fact that his name has been mentioned in is connection too many times . It is a wellknown saying in the Vatican that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cardinal , " at is , popular favorites never win . ( Cardinals nd their friends , sometimes , will go to any length to prevent journalists from mentioning their names as possible future Popes , for the fear of spoiling any chance they have . ) If circumstances should necessitate the choice of an American as Pope , Francis Cardinal Spellman would certainly be considered ? as the most famous of the American Archbishops , as a close friend of Pius XII , and as an energetic , much traveled , Italian-speaking , and capable prelate . But his very assets are , in the mysterious realm of Papal affairs , a liability . He is too famous , too powerful ; sedate and thoughtful Cardinals are wary of his incessant activity , his material achievements . Actually , Cardinal Stritch of Chicago or Cardinal Mooney of Detroit would seem to have a better chance . WHICH ITALIAN ? IF THE next Pope were to be Italian the choice would be theoretically vast . All Cardinals , except the very old , have a chance . In : eality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are considered unlikely by the well-informed , who mention two or three names at most as " papabili " or Papal timber . The names most frevently mentioned are those of two Cardinals born in Genoa . Both could properly claim the motto which , according to the legend , Saint Malachias has attributed to the next Pontiff , Pastor e Nauta , " " Shepherd and helmsman . " One is the Archbishop of Genoa , Giuseppe Cardinal Siri ; the other is the Archbishop of Bologna , Giacomo Cardinal Lercaro . Both , however , are too well known as possible candidates not to have their chances suffer . Cardinal Siri is fifty years old , the son of a concierge . He was professor of theology at the Gregorian University in Rome at twenty-four years of age , an Archbishop at forty , and a Cardinal at forty-six . He is tall , thin , with a big nose , awe-inspiring , severe . His manner is austere and authoritarian . His culture is vast . He is the author of important and scholarly books on theological subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling for command and is impatient with laggards and the slow-witted . His ecclesiastical career is rare in that it has taken place in one city , his own Genoa after he left Rome ? from simple priest to Archbishop ? and it has given him a slightly prejudiced and provincial point of view . He has often been heard to say , " We in Genoa , do things this way , " as if Genoa were the model for all others . His stand against the Fascists and the Nazis during the last war was independent , uncompromising , and brave . At personal risk , he sheltered Jews and the persecuted . After the war and the bombardments , he organized the construction of shelters for the homeless , fed the hungry , and persuaded the industrialists to do what they could for the unemployed . In spite of his great preoccupation for the humble and the poor , he is not classified as a " Leftist " Cardinal . His principal defect is his age . A young Pope means a long pontificate and perhaps the stiffening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some who also object to his character , too uncompromising and firm , for the efficient conduct of the Church 's vast and varied business . Giacomo Cardinal Lercaro , the Archbishop of Bologna , was born in 1891 , the son of a gardener . His climb has been recent ? fast and brilliant . In five years , from 1948 , he climbed the rungs from parish priest to Bishop of Ravenna , to Archbishop of Bologna , and finally was made a Cardinal in 1953 . His see is the Communist capital of Italy , where a Communist mayor , officials , deputati are regularly elected with overwhelming majorities . Cardinal Lercaro tackled the problem with his own methods . He organized , among other things , groups of " fiat ' . volantt " or " flying monks , " young and energetic , who travel all over the countryside with old and rusty automobiles , stop in village squares , attract a crowd , and challenge Communists to a public debate . Their very presence is heartening for the antiCommunists . The Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that show the Church is not deaf to the pressing material and spiritual needs of today . His living quarters are crowded with orphans whom he takes care of as if they were  | his own nephews . ( It is an old habit , with him . He started it when he was a humble parish priest . ) Visitors are impressed to see the Cardinal , his one-hundred-year-old mother , and all the little children around the dinner table . In the last few years , while the Communist threat has gradually waned , Left-wing policies and hopes for revolutionary social reforms , such as fame attributes to the Archbishop of Bologna , are slowly going out of fashion . Many people are going back to more stable and fundamental concepts . Cardinal Lercaro , who was looked upon as an interpreter of the Church 's new bold social theories , is now regarded a little too much on the Left for comfort . Out of his generous and saintly desire to free his flock from the Communist clutches , he lately has committed a few candid political mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chances to reach the Pontifical Throne are slighter today than a few years ago . Both Siri and Lercaro should be regarded as timber for " political " Popes . The rule-of-thumb would then seem to eliminate them from immediately succeeding Pius XII . A third man , a brilliant , learned , devout man , a born leader , whom the majority of the well-informed consider the most likely to become Pope one day , is not only also " political , " like the Archbishops of Genoa and Bologna , but has not even yet been made a Cardinal , and therefore can not be officially included among the probable candidates . This is Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini , Archbishop of Milan , who was Substitute Secretary of State until 1954 . He was born in Brescia in 1897 , the son of a well-known Catholic political leader . ( His brother is now a Democratic Christian deputato in Parliament . ) Monsignor Montini is known to have been the closest colleague Pius XII has ever had , the one whose ideas more nearly matched the Holy Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest in Christendom , one of the most difficult in Italy . His flock contains a large number of industrial workers , most of then organized by the Communists . Montini is hard-working , clear-headed , energetic ; and he undoubtedly charms all who meet him . This does not make him a political hothead . He is merely more keenly attuned than others to the problems of today . His reading is vast , his culture solid ; his manner is open , sometimes even blunt . In Milan , where he often preaches in factories , he avoids ecclesiastical cliches , follows all problems , remembers everything . With health that is perhaps not quite as strong as his activities require , he never rests . Why is he not , then , a Cardinal , when the scarlet biretta traditionally has always gone with his post ? Why is he the first to have had charge of the Secretariat of State and of the Archdiocese of Milan without becoming a Prince of the Church ? It is known that in 1953 he refused the honor and that Pius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the secret consistory on January 12 , 1953 , announcing to all Cardinals gathered together the unusual fact of the renunciation . When will he wave aside his objections , whatever they were ? Will he be made a Cardinal before the present Pope 's death ? Will he sit in the next Conclave among the papalili ? And will he be elected in spite of his eminently political character ? A number of factors must be reckoned with when considering such matters , many of them known but to a few of the highest ecclesiastics in the Vatican , others unknown to all but the Pope . The choice of Pius XII 's successor depends on events which have not yet taken place . Will there be another consistory ? Will other Cardinals be named ? What will the future course of history be in Italy and the world ? What will appear to be the most important needs of the Church at the moment of the next Conclave ? Who will then be alive and who will be dead ? If we follow the Vatican rule-of-thumb and oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the best-known candidates , this is the way things will probably turn out : the next Pope will , in all probability , still be an Italian , a saintly old Cardinal , with a rich experience in the administration of parishes , dioceses , archdioceses , the Vatican itself , and of the many organizations depending from theta : a man in touch with the common people but never connected with definite and intransigent political views , either of the Right or of the Left . His old age will not be an insurmountable obstacle , as his task will not have to be a long one . The description , of course , fits any number of Cardinals nobody ever mentions among the pa pa h i l i . After him , when the Pope will have to be " political " once again , it may be that one of the men named in this article , Agagianian . Siri , or Lercaro will be elected . Some of the best-informed are of the firm opinion that it will then have to be Giovanni Battista Montini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid being considered a present candidate , - but who , by then , will probably have accepted it .
