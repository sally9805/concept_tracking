In a column about horse races , the New York Herald Tribune 's Red Smith last week wrote : " Mr. Joe E. Lewis , who says comical things in nightclubs and bets on them at race tracks , is the author of a profound observation made after years of first-hand study . ' I have been rich and I have been poor , ' Mr. Lewis says , ' and believe me , rich is better . ' There are various ways of getting rich without help from the Federal Housing Administration . " <P> By now , obviously , the FHA scandals have become part of nightclub repertories , Red Smith 's column and American folk lore generally . ( The tabloids had fun with the story of Ian Woodner , a Washington builder who charged to FHA projects $87,000 for detectives-partly to check up on his ex-wife . ) Until last week , however , nobody knew much about the central character : Clyde L. ( for Lilbon ) Powell , 58 , who joined FHA under the Democrats in 1934 and was forced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner , he authorized projects that netted some $500 million in unwarranted windfall profits . <P> Powell , who looks like Santa Claus with a shave , twice refused to testify before Senator Homer Capehart 's Banking Committee . Last week , called up again , he refused again-to avoid incriminating himself . But other witnesses were more obliging . <P> Easy Come . An officer of the Riggs National Bank , where Powell kept an account and a safe-deposit box , testified that from 1945 through 1953 Powell deposited $218,630-nearly three times as much as his total federal salary , which he listed as his only income on his tax returns . <P> Nathan Manilow , developer of Chicago 's $30 million Park Forest project , indicated where Powell 's extra money came from . One source , it turned out , was Manilow himself . In March 1948 Manilow lent Powell $7,500 . Soon afterwards Powell authorized Park Forest to collect two months ' advance rent from tenants . <P> Outright bribery was reported by Albert Cassel , an architect who had asked Powell for a $709,000 added mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the amount of work he had done on the thing , " said Cassel , " how he helped the project to survive from the very beginning , and before this thing would be finally approved by him we would have to give him $10,000 . " <P> Did he pay up ? Yes , said Cassel ; he gave Powell $10,000 in three installments , and right away the $709,000 increase was approved . <P> Easy Go . Powell 's pressing need for money was explained , in part , by a Damon Runyonesque witness : Wardwell Dexter , onetime bookie commission man , whose yellow , shortsleeved shirt brightened the somber Senate caucus room . Dexter related that Powell made racing bets by phone almost every day , averaging $100 or more daily for a time . Sometimes he did not pay the losses . One day he bet $1,500 , and lost . " What was your relationship with Clyde Powell ? " he was asked . " Unfortunate , " replied Dexter , summing it all up .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
