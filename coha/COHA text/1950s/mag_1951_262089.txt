With each passing week , as the screws are slowly turned down , Juan Pern 's Argentina looks more like a fascist-type dictatorship . Last week Pern &; Co. twisted the screws tighter in three fields . <P> LABOR . In Buenos Aires ' suburbs one morning , a series of explosions boomed out ; rails were ripped up and a bridge damaged . Commuter trains were stranded ; thousands were late getting to work . The demonstration was staged by members of La Fraternidad , the brotherhood of engineers and firemen . Bulldozed against their will into the Pernista General Confederation of Labor ( C.G.T. ) , they were striking for the freedom of their union . To Pern , who regards Argentine labor as his permanent prop and personal property , the uproar was acutely embarrassing : first he tried to ignore it by blaming the disturbances on " alien " ( i.e. , U.S. ) influences . Then he had to face facts and invoke emergency powers making strikers subject to military law . That worked , but labor had had one more good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province ( pop . 4,500,000 ) got the details of a new plan of operation for all public schools " to ensure the perpetuation of the Pern revolution by means of a new education . " Among the principles to be taught : " the conviction that Pernistas must carry out Argentina 's historic mission . " History , geography , economics are all to be brought into line . This move to shore up the regime by forced indoctrination of youth-a classic dictatorial technique-did not pass without protest . Cried Senator Ricardo Gonzlez : " This government . . . now wants to contaminate the very wellsprings of the Argentine spirit . " <P> JOURNALISM . Since the murder of La Prensa ( TIME , March 12 , et seq . ) , Buenos Aires ' last surviving independent daily is La Natin-proud , conservative , accurate . Argentines who hunger for honest news instead of government pap now queue up at the paper 's office at 6 a.m. to buy the few extra copies available ( Pern controls the newsprint and holds the circulation down to 180,000 daily ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When La Natin reported last week 's rail strike factually instead of parroting the government line , the Pernista press and radio launched a vicious attack on the paper . Recalling that La Prensa had been similarly attacked for objective reporting of last January 's rail strike , observers wondered whether this might be a prelude to a final assault on La Natin.
