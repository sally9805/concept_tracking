Up to a few weeks ago , the dispute over the Sudan was a textbook example of unprofitable diplomacy . All parties had crawled far out on separate limbs . The British had 1 ) all but pushed the Egyptians out of the million square miles of Sudan , despite the continuing fiction of a condominium and 2 ) firmly promised the 8,000,000 Sudanese the right of self-determination . The Egyptians had 1 ) named King Farouk Sovereign of the Sudan and 2 ) let it be known that they considered the pro-Independence party in Sudan ( the Umma ) a collection of dogs and British lickspittles . For the Sudanese , Umma Leader Sayed Abdul Rahman el Mahdi , * the richest man in the Sudan , had threatened a holy war if the Egyptians tried to get back in .

The Sudan issue was the main obstacle to cordial British-Egyptian relations , and the sooner it was settled the sooner peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its training , the British Foreign Office pulled the saving maneuver : while London would not renege on its promise of self-determination for the Sudanese , it was O.K. with London if the Sudanese themselves , of their own free will , wanted to negotiate with Egypt . <P> Soon , a distinguished six-man Umma delegation headed for Cairo . In four formal meetings and nine if tars ( sundown breakfasts during the fast month of Ramadan ) , the two sides narrowed down the issues . Said Egypt 's Premier , Hilaly Pasha : if the Sudanese want self-government , they can have it .

Said the Umma leaders : if the Sudanese want to recognize Farouk 's sovereignty , well &; good , but first let the Sudanese decide that by a plebiscite . Neither side went out on any limbs . The meetings were good-natured , enlivened by Hilaly 's complicated puns in Arabic . <P> They ended last week with the understanding that old Umma Party Chief Sayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks . All sides were still far from agreeing , but-as one Sudanese minister explained it- " Our viewpoints were as far apart as Cairo and Khartoum 1,100 miles ; the distance now is only that from Cairo to Aswan 460 miles . " Cairo and London agreed that the chances for a settlement were the best in months . <P> <P> * Posthumous son of the great Mahdi ( messiah ) whose desert dervishes laid siege to the undermanned British garrison of Khartoum in 1884 , hacked to death its famed commander , General Charles ( " Chinese " ) Gordon . Thirteen years later Kitchener avenged Gordon 's death by smashing the dervishes at Omdurman . The Mahdi was already dead , but Kitchener ordered his tomb razed , his bones thrown into the Nile .
