For Americans in Europe , the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune , with its gossipy items about tourists and its store of U.S. news , has always been as comforting as a letter from home . Since its first issue in October 1887 , the Herald has also been a comforting and legendary outpost for a legion of freewheeling roistering U.S. newsmen who worked there while they saw Paris-and later filled a dozen books with their nostalgic , wine-ripened memories . But the Herald Tribune has never found it easy to keep its 62-year-old outpost victualed and supplied . Its circulation , once up to 35,000 , was down to 10,000 in 1939 . After the Germans took Paris , the Herald suspended . <P> When it reopened in 1944 , it had a new editor-36-year-old Geoffrey Parsons Jr. , wartime chief of the Trib 's London bureau and son of the New York Trib 's chief editorial writer . Parsons , a solid newsman and no roisterer , tried to put a new polish on the old formula by adding such features as David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1947 , circulation had climbed to above the prewar peak ( the Herald appears on 6,500 European newsstands ) , but the paper had stayed for the most part in the red . Later it was hard hit by currency devaluations , which raised its costs and cut its advertising revenues . <P> Nevertheless , last year Editor Parsons was assured by General Manager William Wise that the Paris Herald was finally climbing into the black . But a preliminary audit towards year 's end indicated a moderate loss . By the time all the returns were in-and the complexities of devaluation taken into account-the loss had soared to more than $100,000 . <P> Publisher Helen Reid of the Herald Tribune , as appalled as Parsons , sent Buel Weare , the New York Trib 's syndicate manager , hustling to Paris to take over from Wise , who had resigned . Weare started to trim the small ( 19 men ) editorial staff , and cut the Herald 's eight-page editions to six and sometimes four pages . Month ago , Editor Parsons got a cable from Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that Weare had made another recommendation : lop off the editor 's job-and Parsons ' $19,500 salary-and combine the editor 's functions with the general manager 's . Last week Editor Parsons resigned , pocketed a $10,000 consolation prize and began to look around for another job . Walter Kerr , Herald Tribune foreign editor , was named European Editor for both papers , with headquarters in Paris . The new president and top dog of the Paris Herald : Buel Weare.
