On cold football dope , the big game figured to be a struggle between California 's sturdy line and Ohio State 's speedy backfield . But as Rose Bowl time drew near at Pasadena , it seemed as if such matters as drinking water , the weather and human nature might weigh as heavily in the outcome as downright football ability . <P> California , thanks to the adroit needling of Coach Lynn ( " Pappy " ) Waldorf , had worked up enough steam to press all the pants in Southern California . The Golden Bears were bent on proving that the Far West was working its way back to the top of the U.S. football pile , after ten years of anemia and three consecutive Rose Bowl drubbings . All last week the pipings from Ohio State 's camp in Pasadena were music to Waldorf 's ears . <P> Ohio State 's popular Coach Wes Fesler , who back in Columbus had kept alumni relatively satisfied for three years , was kept busy in California denying a report that he was quitting after this season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called in newsmen to deny rumors of dissension on the squad . For reasons best known to Trainer Ernest Biggs , the Buckeyes had not bothered to bring their own bottled drinking water ( a precaution always taken on long trips by such teams as Army ) . On top of that , Ohio State was beginning to feel lazy in the sunny 70 weather . But when Ohio State trotted on the field before more than 100,000 partisan fans , it did not play like an underdog . <P> <P> For 58 minutes , the Buckeyes gave as good as they got . Then , with the score tied at 14-all , Place-kicker Jim Hague dropped back to try an 18-yd. field goal . His educated toe put the ball squarely between the posts . Final score , Ohio State 17 , California 14 . <P> In other bowls : <P> Sugar . Powerful Oklahoma rolled over L.S.U. , 35-0 , after discovering that a spy had tried to film some secret Okie plays during a pre-game practice . Cotton . Rice bottled up North Carolina 's highly advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27-13 . Orange . Underdog Santa Clara , whose specialty is playing the role of giant-killer , cut down Kentucky , 21-13.
