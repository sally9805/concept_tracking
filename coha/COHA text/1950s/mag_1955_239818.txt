One of the deepest polarizations of the human intellect caught up with Frederick H. Zurmuhlen , New York City Commissioner of Public Works . As a result , a half-ton statue of the Prophet Mohammed last week was lying flat on its back in a Newark storehouse . <P> The statue was carved 50 years ago by a Mexican sculptor as one of ten giant figures of lawmakers to adorn the new home of the first Appellate Department of the New York court system , overlooking Manhattan 's Madison Square . The other nine were Moses , Hindustan 's Manu , Persia 's Zoroaster , Sparta 's Lycurgus , Athens ' Solon , China 's Confucius , Byzantium 's Justinian , Wessex ' Alfred and France 's Louis IX . An odd list , but it is easy to see what those who drew it up had in mind . They wanted to express the universality of the idea of law . Lycurgus and Confucius , Zoroaster and Alfred stand for very disparate systems of conduct-and the Appellate Division was not necessarily buying any of them . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems partake of the notion that man 's nature calls for rules of behavior . <P> The universality that the courthouse designers reached for in the statues is expressed in an abhorrence of statues by other peoples . Among these are the Mohammedans , whose earliest success in Arabia came by overthrowing local idols and thereby calling attention to the universal God . Eastern Christianity was ripped by two great waves of iconoclasm scarcely less thorough than Mohammed 's , and resting on the belief that images of God or of holy persons begot idolatry by distracting attention from the essence of the Godhead to the superficialities of concrete appearance . Today , the issue is only a minor one among Christians , but the vast majority of Moslems still take very seriously the Mosaic rule against graven images ; they are especially incensed by statues of religious leaders , and , among these , a statue of Mohammed would be especially offensive . <P> All this got back to Commissioner Zurmuhlen when his engineers reported a few years ago that time was eating away at the statues atop the Appellate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawgivers would be lifted from their pedestals on the building 's roof and repaired . When Mohammed 's name appeared among the rest , the ambassadors of Indonesia , Egypt and Pakistan told the U.S. State Department , on behalf of their Moslem peoples , that the Prophet 's image should not go up again . <P> The State Department sent two emissaries to explain the matter to Commissioner Zurmuhlen . The question was laid before the justices of the Appellate Division . All agreed that Mohammed would not go up again-even though the danger that any large number of New Yorkers would take to worshiping the statue was , admittedly , minimal . As a result of diplomatic iconoclasm , the Newark stonecutter who repaired the statues was asked to take Mohammed quietly away . The other statues were closed up to conceal the gap , and now Zoroaster has Mohammed 's old place on the southwest corner , facing toward Staten Island .
