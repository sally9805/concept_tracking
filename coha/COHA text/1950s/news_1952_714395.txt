txt One of the largest judgments in history against an individual was handed down yesterday by Federal Judge Edward Weinfeld . His target was Harrison Williams , 78-year-old utilities executive whose empire rivaled that of the late Samuel Insult in the Twenties . Mr. Williams , whose wife has frequently won the title of " best dressed woman in America , " was held by the judge to owe trustees in one of his corporations 312,000 , - 000 , plus interest dating back to 1927 that would more than double the sum . Mr. Williams had put his own best interests ahead of those of the companies he controlled , the judge held . As an offset , the judge ordered the . return to Mr. Williams of 68 , - 423 , shares of another of his own correlations , the North . . American Company . ' The stock is now selling at ' slightly Under $20 a share . However , with rights- accumulating back to : it may-be worth betwain ' ; 13,000,090 ' and $8,090,000 : Mr. Williams is the dominant factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution . Thus , the adverse effect on Mr. Williams , once rated as a billionaire , would be at a minimum . of $17,000,000 . However , Judge Weinfeld cleared him of eight out of , twelve civil charges that centered on the " looting " of the Central States Electric Corporation , once a key company in- the Williams empire . The value of that company dropped from 8400,000,000 in 1929 to $1,300,000 in 1942 . The big verdict against Mr. Williams was in favor of Carl J. Austrian and Robert G. Butcher , court-appointed trustees for Central States . At the same time , the decision cleared of liability , either on grounds of lack of damage to Central States or lack of intent to damage Central States , a host of Wall Street celebrities who figured in the intricate interlocking utility holding corporations set up between 1921 and the stock market crash of October , 1929 . These included Clarence Dillon of Dillon Read , John Foster Dulles , who was counsel to Central States and to Goldman , Sachs , which became involved with the Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Stone and a host of others who were at one time or another directors of companies Mr. Williams dominated or dealt with . Familiar Companies Involved The case , which goes back to 1942 , was virtually a backdrop to the 1929 financial stage . Figuring in the transactions were such companies as North American Securities Company , Shenandoah , Goldman-Sachs Trading Corporation , Blue Ridge , all familiar to investors of that era , plus Central States , the key company . Judge Weinfeld held first that Mr. Williams ' influence in his companies , even though he held no office and attended no meetings , was so dominant that all rules of liability had to apply in cases where he benefited from dealings with them and the dominated companies suffered losses . He held also that this domination lasted until 1942 , when Central States first went into reorganization . Mr. Austrian and Mr. Butcher brought suit in 1915 , in ample time under Federal laws , the judge noted , to avoid the statute of limitations against Mr. Williams , even though the acts complained of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute can not begin to run if domination is so complete that fraud or other acts adverse to the companies can not be discovered , the court held . The case is scheduled to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court on the question of the statute of limitations . While the normal rule is that state laws would govern in suits brought in Federal court between citizens of different states , Judge Weinfeld held that Congress had made an exception in Federal reorganization suits . The judge also held in favor of Mr. Williams in a situation where it was brought out that Mr. Williams had donated more than $38 , - 000.000 in securities to his various companies after the 1929 crash . The trustees argued that the " donation " had actually adversely affected Central States by $9,375,000 , but Judge Weinfeld ruled to the contrary . However , he turned down Mr. Williams ' plea that this " donation " be used to offset any verdict against him on any of the other twelve counts in the suit . " It is clear , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not intended to secure exoneration from liability nor do the facts warrant offsetting them against any other claim on which he has been found liable . " 22-Year-Old Deal " Rescinded " The verdict against Mr. Williams was due almost entirely to one count , which the judge upheld , involving $11,460,000 , with interest since Sent 23. 1929 , and the 68,423 shares of North American stock . Judge Weinfeld " rescinded " the transaction , more than twentytwo years after it occurred . It involved Mr. Williams " selling " the 68,423 shares of North American stock , out of his own I holdings , when Central States was under contractual obligation to sell the stock to the same purchaser , another Williams - dominated corporation . " The court concludes , to state it bluntly , " Judge Weinfeld wrote , " that this was simply a case where , after Central States sold and made delivery of the stock , and received the proceeds of the sale , Williams , whatever his reasons , which we need not probe , decided to avail himself of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the fact that North American stock was fluctuating violently on the market at the time , and then he added : " The funds which belonged to Central States landed in Williams ' companies treasuries on Sept. 23 . Thus , Central States ' absolute right under its contract with Blue Ridge to receive and retain the $11,460,000 was invaded . " Williams violated his fiduciary obligations to the corporation and imposed upon it a transaction that lacks any acceptable elements of fairness to Central States . " The other verdicts against Mr. Williams rest on cases where companies he dominated bought stock at less than the market price from other companies he ran , or sold it at higher than the market price for his benefit . Several other directors were held liable on these counts , but since their connections with the companies died years ago , only one , Louis E. Kilmarx , was held liable in yesterday 's decision , along with Mr. Williams . The court indicated clearly , however , that it expected the recovery to be against Mr. Williams , not Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dulles was cleared specifically of three charges and Mr. Dillon of one . In a case in which Mr. Dulles and his law firm , Sullivan &; Cromwell , were counsel for Goldman Sachs in a deal with Central States , the court held that Central States had not really suffered . In the " donation " deal , the judge held that Central States had benefited . In a third case , in which Mr. Dulles was accused of " covering up " Mr. Williams ' interest in certain transactions , Judge Weinfeld held that the record did not justify the charge . Mr. Dillon and Mr. . Williams were held to have been " hard bargainers " in another transaction , but Judge Weinfeld ruled that the circumstances were such that the men were independent operators and free to bargain as hard as they wanted . The case has already been to the United States Supreme Court on jurisdictional grounds . When Mr. Austrian and Mr. Butcher filed suit in 1945 the defense contended they should have sued in West Virginia , not New York . The Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was begun before Judge Weinfeld early last year . The trial itself lasted thirteen weeks and Judge Weinfeld has spent days , evenings , week-ends and holidays since September studying the record and writing the 110-page opinion he handed down yesterday .
