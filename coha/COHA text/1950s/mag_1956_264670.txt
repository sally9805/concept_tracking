While eager prospectors searched for oil all around the world , beneath the sea and in the mountains , high-living Houston last week took a look under its garbage and found black gold . An independent driller , Trice Production Co. , brought in a rich ( 140 bbls. daily ) well from 8,000 ft. below the city dump , and gave it an appropriate label : " Houston City Dump No. 1 . " <P> Dump No. 1 is the latest strike in the old Pierce Junction salt dome , where wells are pushing ever closer to Houston 's city limits . For more than three decades prospectors in Pierce Junction made occasional strikes at conservative depths of 2,000 ft. to 5,000 ft . Then , in 1949 , Wildcatter Glenn McCarthy dared to go deeper , brought in a well from between 7,000 ft. and 8,000 ft . But McCarthy did not follow through . Not until lesser-known Wildcatter E. C. Scurlock brought home a deep payload late in 1954 did the Pierce Junction boom begin . <P> In the past year it has become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sunk 171 producing wells deep into the treeless flat , now get around 24,000 bbls. daily from the field . Said one Houston newsman : " The whole town is on the verge of being overrun by derricks . " Oil rigs are creeping within 100 yds. of the residences and businesses off Houston 's primary north-south thoroughfare , South Main Street . One derrick stands 75 yds. from the roller coaster at Playland Park : another is within No. 7-iron distance ( 125 yds. ) of the South Main Golf Center driving range . Two more wells have been drilled in the path of a proposed $20 million freeway , which probably will be rerouted . Worried Harris County officials have urged the Texas Railroad Commission to deny future oil permits on freeway land . <P> Musing about the fact that traces of oil have been found downtown when water wells were drilled , some Texans crack about tearing down Houston ( and rebuilding it a few miles away ) to get at the oil . Since the downtown real estate is worth more than the oil potential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the oil is worth a lot to the city of Houston . The city holds a one-fourth interest in " City Dump No. 1 , " should reap $40,000 yearly from it . Trice already has begun drilling " City Dump No. 2 ' ' on the same profits deal with Houston . Geologists figure that the 300-acre dump is good for at least 15 producing wells . Such a sea under her garbage could enrich the city government by $600,000 a year .
