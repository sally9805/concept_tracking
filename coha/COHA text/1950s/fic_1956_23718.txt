F 4 V E R Y O N E had agreed that it was a mistake for Mr. Minturn to live so close to Chelton after his retirement . The neat red-brick house which the board of trustees had remodeled for him was almost within the shadow of the Gothic spire of the school chapel and actually within sight of the headmaster 's rambling mansion that he had occupied for forty years . How could Arthur Knox , people asked , ever feel that it was his school if he had to administer it under the penetrating eyes of the small , brisk , silver-haired , round-bodied man who had become to every graduate and boy a living symbol of the school itself ? And worse yet , Arthur Knox was a Chelton man ; he , too , had been exposed when young to the strange compulsion of that diminutive figure in the pulpit , the arms rising and falling as the full , rich , cadenced voice , in measured tones , held up before three hundred boys the sanitary virtues , clean living , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiteness of a sheet . He had known , too , the tireless pedestrian of the school grounds , inspecting , unrelaxing , with the poking ebony walking stick , the benevolent figure in the headmaster 's study , chuckling as he read aloud the Fezziwig chapters of the " Christmas Carol , " and , never . to be forgotten , the stiff , disciplining magistrate , shaking with the gusts of a terrifying anger . For Mr. Minturn , who breathed the pale , thin air of an early New England , with a straight code of what was wholesome and what was not , what was funny and what merely sophisticated , or , as he put it , " blazzy , " could be terrifying . It was why so many of his graduates , in their atrophied religious consciences , later in life , thought of him when they thought of God . But Mr. Minturn did not think of himself as terrifying , or of anyone else , much less Arthur Knox , as being afraid of him . He saw no reason whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and his daughters , large , bony , middle-aged women of undoubted filial devotion but limited sympathy , had both married Chelton men , one now a trustee of the school , and had prospered undemonstratively in Boston , only an hour away , They wanted him , sincerely enough , to come f o them , but he had more interest in them than in their lives . His life was the school . A few , a very few of the older graduates had ventured to hint that his continued residence on the campus might prove an embarrassment to the new head , but he could not see it . He was quite sure that they did not realize the tact of which he was capable . He had known Arthur Knox since the latter 's boyhood : he had followed his early career in the ministry and his more recent years as head of a smaller boys ' school : he believed him thoroughly grounded in the ideals of Chelton and most capable of their efficient promotion . Now it would be Arthur 's school ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asked ? Why , did n't he have his correspondence with the graduates and his sermons to preach ? What more did he need but his daily walk around the school and the playing grounds , past the long , rambling Elizabethan dormitories with their coats of ivy , the war memorial fountain , so white and placid , the chapel with its Gothic tower thrust up sharply against the lowering sun ; ending up , stick in hand and puffing at a pipe , to watch the football practice on the first squad field ? It was impossible , of course , for him not to notice things . It was impossible , for example , not to observe that the number of boys playing tennis on October afternoons was double what it had been in his day . And there was something silly , in Mr. Minturn 's opinion , about a fifteenyear-old batting a little white ball across a net on a crisp autumnal day within actual earshot of the staccato " Signals ! Signals ! " from the foot-ball field below . However , he supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse was the appearance of a white refrigerator truck with soft drinks driving right through the Eliot Gate and parking by the first squad field . Mr. Minturn had hardly thought he was interfering when he had ordered the driver summarily from the grounds , scattering the boys around the vehicle with a word . What had been his surprise to be told by the driver , and not politely , either , that authority had come from the headmaster himself ! He had brooded about this and thereafter avoided the first squad field where the hateful truck squatted brazenly , silhouetted against the chapel itself . But this was not all . Ile had even to admit it was minor compared to what was still to come . Returning home late one evening when he had walked as far as the river , he passed the great windows of the dining-hall as the boys were filing in for supper . Filing , however , was no longer the appropriate term . They piled in each way , every way , no longer standing at their places before the long tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sitting down immediate ) , and grabbing for the bread and butter . And he noticed distinctly , approaching a side window in the cold , darkening air , seeing but unseen , that they had not changed to stiff collars . Well , it was disturbing . It really was . One could argue that boys had been brought up as Christians without stiff collars in the evening or that the sale of pop on the campus was not necessarily fatal to their development , but how many stones could be pulled out of the foundation before a crack appeared in the facade itself ? And it was just such a crack that he thought he perceived one Sunday afternoon while walking past the fields behind the gymnasium . A group of younger boys was engaged in a game of touch football , and as he paused , leaning on his stick to watch them , his ears were cut by a cry . " ' Jesus Christ , butterfingers , ca n't you ever hang on to that ball ! " He stared , incredulous at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The others , however , seemed to treat it as entirely normal . " Boy ! " he shouted in his old tone , and now they stopped , and turned to him in astonishment . " You , boy ! " he continued , pointing at the offender , " come over here ! " " But I 'm playing in the game , sir . " " Come here this minute ! " Mr. Minturn thundered , and the boy came quickly over . " What 's your name ? " " Sloane , sir . " " Do you know what day it is , Sloane ? " " Yes , sir . It 's Sunday , sir . " " And do n't you know Whose day Sunday is ? " " I beg your pardon , sir ? " " Is n't Sunday the Lord 's Day ? " " Oh . Yes , sir . I expect it is . " " He whose name you were taking in vain ? " The boy 's face cleared now . He even smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearing , was n't 1 ? Sorry , sir . It was the game , you know . " But Mr. Minturn 's face became even graver . " The game ! " he exclaimed . " Do you think a game excuses you ? We 'll have to teach you , Sloane . Yes , indeed , I 'm afraid we will . You will go immediately and report to the headmaster at his house . If he is n't in , you will wait in the front hall until he comes . You will tell him what I heard you say . I do n't wish to repeat it . " He saw the consternation in the troubled face before him and sensed it in the hovering figures of the other boys . Did he have to be obeyed , they were wondering , this testy old man from another world , this legend known to them more through the portrait in the dining-hall and the talcs of their fathers than from their own vision of the shuffling little figure who sat in the back of the chapel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloane , did you hear me ? " The boy turned and walked sulkily off in the direction of Mr. Knox 's house . Mr. Minturn nodded to the others . " Continue your game , boys , " he said gruffly and proceeded on his tour . His mind , however , was in too much of a turmoil for pleasant walking and after some minutes ' debate he turned down Knox 's driveway toward the rambling Victorian mansion that he had occupied so long . The maid showed him into the study just as young Sloane , avoiding his eye , slipped by him in the corridor . " Well , Mr. M ! " the headmaster cried heartily , rising as he entered and stretching out his hand . " It 's been too long . Much too long ! You must know that Sally and I want you to feel this house is yours . " " You 're very kind , Arthur . " He sat down and glanced about the huge bare study whose walls had once been covered to the ceiling with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of countless rows of earnest strong young faces . Over the mantel now was a colored print of a Ronaith Christ . Mr. Knox , bare and energetic as his study , long , strong , balding , big-nosed , leaned forward on his elbows . " This is a sort of a busman 's holiday for you , is n't it , Mr. M ? " he asked smiling . " Helping the new administration with its disciplinary problems ? " He threw his hands in the air . " Not that we do n't need it We do , we do ! No doubt of it ! I 'm grateful for your trouble , sir . " " You mean Sloane , " Mr. Minturn answered in a more serious tone . " I was sure you would n't regard that as interfering . I thought you 'd want to know . " " That 's right . You 're quite right . " Mr. Knox nodded his head several times in brisk succession . " We do n't want language like that to become current on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein on his tongue when he 's spent Saturday afternoon washing my new Buick . " Mr. Minturn paused for a moment as he took this in . " Am I to understand that that will be his punishment ? " he asked . " To wash your car ? " " Well , of course , he 'll have to miss the game , too . They hate that , you know . " " Do we care what they hate- and what they do n't ? " Mr. Minturn demanded , raising his voice in spite of himself . " Is n't it a question of the offense ? Washing a master 's car is the penalty for skipping assembly or having an untidy cubicle . You know that , Arthur . Not for blasphemy ! What do you think you 'd have got when you were a boy here ? " " Well , if you 'd heard me , Mr. NI , " Mr. Knox answered , grinning broadly , " I 'd have been lucky if I had n't been suspended ! " " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at his successor . " Do you imply , Arthur , that there were different levels of justice in lily day ? " " No , no , nothing like that , sir , " Mr. Knox replied hastily , raising his hands to deprecate the suggestion . " It 's only that today  --  well , sir , it 's hard for some of these boys . They hear their fathers , even their mothers , I 'm afraid , saying the kind of thing that you heard young Sloane say . Some parents are actually proud of it . It makes them feel their children arc intimate with them . " Ile shook his head . " Even in some of our best families , sir . " " And why , then , do these ' best families , ' as you call them , send their sons here ? " Mr. Minturn demanded with a snort . " Is n't it because they want the school to do the job they lack the fortitude to do themselves ? " But he could get nowhere with Knox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceding every point he made , admitting cheerfully that the situation was complicated , that he , Knox , was undoubtedly making a mistake , probably lots of them , but that , after all , somebody had to make the decision , And all the while Mr. Minturn had the uncomfortable feeling that he was congratulating himself for his amiable toleration of a reactionary and meddlesome old man . T H E next morning after chapel he fell in with Mr. Collins behind the long file of boys who walked two by two to the schoolhouse . Collins , the head of the classics department , was a tubby , rather mincing bachelor of fifty-odd who craved gossip and whose company Mr. Minturn ordinarily took some pains to avoid . This morning , however , he was seeking information . " ' ' ell me , Collins , " he began , " is it true that Latin is to be made optional ? " Mr. Collins paused and nodded . " The mother of languages , Mr. M , " he answered in mournful tones , " must veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in its place ? " " Cooking , I daresay , or Icelandic sagas ! " Collins exclaimed . " Who knows , with him ? " Mr. Minturn did not like the suggestion of disloyalty in this use of the pronoun . " Come now , things ca n't be that bad , " " Ca n't they ? Ca n't they indeed , Mr. M ? " Collins paused , almost smacking his lips . " You have n't heard , then , about our pickaninny ? " " Your what , man ? " " You have n't heard that he 's embraced the cause of racial toleration ? That he 's opening the school to a Negro boy ? " " You do n't mean it ! " " But I do , " Collins continued , delighted with his reaction . " You can read about it in the papers tomorrow . Our white knight , needless to say , has not forgotten the reporters . Oh , he 'll be cock of the walk now ! " " A colored boy ? One colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , for a start . I wonder if it wo n't be something of a shock to the little girls who come up to the Washington 's Birthday dance . Or to their mothers , anyway . But 1 suppose you and I are antediluvian , Mr. M. A good century behind the times . " " I 'll speak to him , " Mr. Minturn muttered , half to himself . " I 'll speak to him this very morning . " He went straight to the classrooms building and to the headmaster 's office . From the waiting room he could hear Mr. Knox talking on the telephone , but the secretary , who was new , seemed not to think it in the least.unreasonable that Mr. Minturnshould be asked to wait , that two other people , in fact , parents of a prospective student , should be ushered in ahead of him . When his turn finally came and he brushed indignantly by her into the office , he had n't planned to say what he did . " You 've kept me waiting ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The headmaster ' was on his feet immediately as Mr. Minturn entered . " You 're not sorry ! Speak the truth , man ! You did it to put me in my place . To let me know you were tired of interference ! " " My dear Mr. M , I beg you to believe me ? " But Mr. Minturn cut him short by raising his hand . lie stared down at the carpet , his other hand at his mouth as he repeatedly cleared his throat , desperately fighting down the black , erupting tide of anger . He sat down , still coughing.MAGAZINE " Let that be , " he said finally . " It does n't signify . I 'm sorry . It 's about the colored boy that I came to see you . Is it true ? " " That we 're taking one in ? It is . Next fall . " Mr. Knox folded his hands as he sat down again in his chair . " I trust you 're not going to side with the unenlightened . You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take one unhappy child like that and put him in a white boys ' school ! " Mr. Minturn exploded in a high , tense tone . " To show what a liberal , forward-looking headmaster you are ! Is that fair to the boy , Knox ? " " But do n't we have to make a start ? Some-where ? " " Then take ten ! Twenty ! " Mr. Knox simply smiled . " I 'm afraid it 's a bit more complicated than that , Mr. Minturn , " he said patiently . " Quite a bit more complicated . I know you ran a great school , sir . One of the greatest . There 's no question of that . But it was a school of its time , like others . And it was a highly class-conscious , race-conscious time . That 's nobody 's fault . It 's simply a fact . But what I have to do is what anyone in my place would have to do , and that is to form a bridge , as it were , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a day , of course . But we can start by making a few changes . 1 know , of course , that it was your policy to give preference to sons of graduates ? " " But that had nothing to do with class-consciousness or race-consciousness ! " Mr. Minturn interrupted . " Oh ? " " 11. did n't , I tell you ! I wanted the school to be a family . And it was , too ! I wanted the boys to have the sense of something handed down , of loving the school their fathers loved , perhaps even sometimes their grandfathers . Not in all cases , of course . I wanted new boys , too . But I cared about preserving a tradition . Of course , you ca n't do that alone by making football a required sport or saying grace before meals , but those things help . " He broke off , realizing that as on the previous day , he was getting no more than a polite and disbelieving attention . It was too much . It was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " he went on explosively . " More democratic than you 'll ever be , with one homesick Negro boy as a feather in your liberal cap ! " Mr , Knox actually had the nerve to burst into a laugh , an overgenial , good-natured laugh . " Oh , Mr. M , you 're priceless ! You really are ! THE TRIAL Wait till I tell my wife that one ! " Mr. Knox said . Mr. M , however , was not to be placated . Without another word or so much as a nod he turned and left the office , once again possessed of a fighting purpose in life . Going to the schedule board , he checked to see if Mr. Collins had a class that hour and then climbed the stairway to the second floor . As he paused outside the Latin teacher 's room he heard the sound of laughter . " Collins ? " he called . Collins , his back to the half-opened door , jumped up . " Why , Mr. Minturnl " he gasped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Prince , sir , of the English department ? " " Of course , I know him . " Had n't he hired him ? He nodded brusquely to the sandy-haired , long-nosed shambling English teacher who had somehow got to his feet and was bowing . " I 'll come back later , Collins . When you 're not busy . " " Oh , but I 'm not , sir ! Mr. " ' time and I were just discussing what you and I talked about this morning . Did you see him ? " " I saw the headmaster . " Mr. Minturn looked suspiciously at Mr. Prince . He had never been entirely sure about Prince , a moody , preoccupied creature with a cerebral , high-church faith that he loved to discuss at the most unsuitable times and places . " You 'll let me know , Mr. Collins , when you 're free ? " " Oh , but we can talk in front of Bobbie , " Collins assured him , hurrying to close the door . " In front of Mr. Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Minturn turned his slow , even gaze from one to the other . " What do you mean , Collins , " he asked , with an ominous mildness , " by ' one of us ' ? " " Perhaps I can answer that , sir , " Prince volunteered with the unexpected boldness that Mr. Minturn remembered from his off-the-cuff theological discourses . " By ' one of us ' Mr. Collins means one of a small group of masters wholeheartedly devoted to the Minturn concept of Chelton . " He paused and drew himself up . " A group that happens to be totally convinced that the new headmaster is doing everything in his power to wreck the school ! " Collins clasped and unclasped his hands . " It 's true , sir ! " he cried nervously , encouraged by the example of his younger friend . " I do n't know why we should be ashamed of caring about the things you taught us ! " Mr. Minturn looked down at the floor for several silent moments . Was this the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ever really experienced temptation , if this grim moment in Collins ' classroom , here on the very boards where the Latin teacher paced daily up and down , clad in imagined purple , before maps of Augustus ' empire , was not the moment that he had so often preached about . Once to every man and nation . He looked back up at the two worried faces before him , like anxious puppy clogs waiting to be taken for a walk . Surely , whatever their angularities , and one learned to tolerate such things in schoolmasters , they were round and whole in their love of Chelton . Yet the Devil could use love ; had he not preached that himself ? " Gentlemen , I only want one thing , as you do , " he said finally , in a sadder tone , " and that is the good of the school . What else matters ? " He sighed and rested both hands on his cane . " Let us not make our judgments hastily . Let us gather our facts . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet together from time to time and tell each other what we 've seen ? Not as critics , mind you . Not as people who have to do anything about what we find . But simply as good old friends of Chelton ? " I T WAS this suggestion that led to their Wednesday night meetings , in Collins ' study , a schedule which they maintained for the rest of the term . Here they debated , with a seriousness only briefly interrupted by Collins ' flights of fancy and Prince 's somber humor , the innovations that continued to erupt on the placid Chelton scene : the abolition of blue suits on Sunday , the weekly movie in the assembly . hall , the permitted weekends to New York and Boston . It sometimes seemed to Mr. Minturn that Collins and Prince actually outdid him in their conservatism . Not , indeed , that he approved of the innovations . Far from it . It was impossible for him even to conceive of the school as otherwise than he had made it , a haven where boys could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner strength which was to be their permanent immunity . But it did occur to him that some of the changes to which his colleagues took such violent exception were a shade trivial , that there was almost an air of juvenile conspiracy to their deliberations , like two schoolboys playing Brutus and Cassius . He even began to wonder if the deference which they accorded him might not be the deference paid an elder statesman lured from his retirement to lend respectability to an act of naked revolt . Once , encountering Mr. Knox in the hall below Collins ' study , it struck him that the latter , embarrassed , hurrying on about his duties , had given him just the Hash of a smile of timid amiability , one that had seemed to hint : " Oh , yes , I know where you 've been , of course . and I 'll pretend to know nothing about it , but , oh , Mr. M , do you ? " The idea that he might be a dupe , that Collins and Prince might be laughing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of familiarity . The evening that he came in to discover Prince sipping a glass of sherry , he remained standing in the doorway , eying the decanter with a frosty stare . " Drinking was not allowed in the masters ' studies , Prince , " he said gruffly . " Not in my day , anyway . Perhaps that is another of the rules that Mr. Knox has seen fit to change . Is it so , Collins ? " He turned to Collins as the senior and hence the one responsible . The latter became quite ashy with embarrassment . " No , sir , I do n't think so , I guess not , " he replied nervously . " Except Bobbie and 1 , who are practically teetotalers , ca n't somehow really regard a sip of sherry as drinking . " His smile was one of desperate appeal . - Can you , sir ? Really ? " " I can , " Mr. Minturn retorted . " What else is it ? Put it away , Prince . Put it away . I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules while I 'm criticizing the administration of his school . " It satisfied him to watch how quickly they scurried to remove the last traces of the incipient sherry party , even to the inoffensive plate of biscuits beside the decanter . " Of course , you 're quite right , sir , " Collins said a bit breathlessly as he resumed his seat . " Quite right . But to tell the truth , sir , I only got out that decanter to drink a little toast . " Mr. Minturn rose above the inconsistency of his excuses . " A toast ? A toast to what ? " Collins looked at Mr. Minturn for a long moment , his eyes beaming a bright admiration , undimmed , apparently , by his recent reproof . " We wanted to drink a toast to the next headmaster of Chelton . " He held up an imaginary glass . " To Mr. MI " Mr. Minturn stared from one to the other of their smiling , nervous faces . " Gentlemen , " he said , after clearing his throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about ? " " It 's about Founder 's Day , Mr. M , " Prince explained in his dry tone . " When the trustees and so many of the graduates are here . That 's the time to catch them , Mr. MI That 's the time to tell ! " Mr. Minturn stared at the long , oval , gray face before him , so prematurely old , so intensely earnest . " Tell them ? " he echoed . " Tell them to replace Knox ? With mire ? " " Oh , good heavens , Mr. M , do n't take us that literally , " Collins intervened hastily . " That would never be necessary . All you will want to do is to tell them in private your thoughts on the subject of Mr. Knox . They 'll do the rest , do n't worry . They never wanted you to retire , anyway . They begged you not to . Every boy in the school knows that . " " But I did retire , manl " Mr. Minturn protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? - demanded Prince . " Fs there a law against it ? It would n't have to be permanent , of course . Not if you did n't want it . You could be the interim head until you 'd picked a new successor . " I T WAS this last that came nearest to convincing him , the idea that he could be given the opportunity to undo the one wrong that he had ever done the school , to take back the reins for a final drive , to restore the damage and hand them over to a worthy successor . Oh , then , what bliss retirement would be , what ecstasy , unlike the first time , to slip back into the shadows and rest with the sense of danger averted ! And why nut ? Was it too great a boon to be given the chance to rectify an error ? Were not the trustees with him ? And as for the graduates , had he not had letters protesting his retirement , hundreds of them ? literally hundreds ? He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would only agree to think the matter over , and think it over he did , painfully and conscientiously throughout the long winter , until the preparations observed around him in his daily walks gave notice of the advent of the great day itself . The winter boardwalks were being taken up , the handball courts repainted , the memorial fountain was receiving a thorough cleaning , and through the windows of the assembly hall he could see the great ' blue curtains for the school pageant being laboriously hung . For this was to he no ordinary Founder 's Day ; it marked the hundredth anniversary of the school , and masses of graduates were expected to overrun the campus and fill the chapel to over-THE TRIAL flowing on the Sunday service of thanksgiving . And before he had really made up his mind what to do , before he had truly conceived of a plan of action , while he still , on the Wednesday before that weekend , was thinking that he had another two days for reflection , he returned from his walk to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great day was already upon hint . It was not at all as he had visualized . He had taken it for granted that it would be Mr. Knox 's day , that he would be able to stand quietly in the periphery and have chats with the older trustees . Instead , he found that the torrent of nostalgia unloosed by the anniversary raged around himself ; he felt like a piece of cork tossed and pitched about , grasping as many of the proffered hands as he could , searching valiantly for small boys ' names to attach to hard , smiling faces , obliged to remember whole packets of things that he did n't recall at all . It was touching , it was heart-filling and it seemed at first encouraging for the project that he still debated , but he began to discover , before the mid-afternoon of the ensuing Friday , that the center of the graduates ' emotional esteem was not necessarily the center of their intellectual attention . In fact , his very apotheosis seemed to create an odd powerlessness ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the very clouds of their incense . When he finally managed to get his own son-in-law , Sam Storey , off in a corner to tell him about the new system of " cuts " for chapel , lie had the greatest difficulty in making himself heard . Sam , whom Mr. Min-turn even suspected , trustee though he was , of having had something to drink , finally realized that he was being asked a question and chose to OF MR . M 51 answer it on the cozy plane of reminiscence . " You 've got to give the guy a chance , Mr. M , " he said , taking his father-in-law by the elbow for perhaps the first time in his life . " He 's doing his best . Now I know the term ' chapel cut ' is offensive to you , but is n't it better than having boys hiding out in the cellar ? " " In the cellar , Sam ? What on earth are you talking about ? " " It 's what I used to do as a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad red face broke into a grin . " It was the only time it was safe to smoke , when all the masters were in chapel ! " His grin van-ished as he saw the expression on Mr. Minturn 's face . " But that was thirty years ago , sir ! You ca n't mind now ! " Mr. Minturn shook his head as he turned away . " You 're a trustee , Sam , " he protested . " A trustee l " But Sam 's reaction , he discovered , was unfortunately typical . It was difficult even to make the men realize that he had a complaint , and when he did , they minimized it with remarks such as " He ca n't live up to you , Mr. M " or " These arc changing times , you know . " Even when they agreed with him , as Bishop Fisher vociferously did about the chapel cuts , he would promise no more than to raise the point at the next meeting of the board of trustees . But worst of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the school 's financial counsel , a sharp , thin , driving , preoccupied man of less than forty who confided in Mr. Minturn his reluctant approval of the headmaster 's racial policy . " I know how it must pain you , Mr. M , to have a coon at Chelton , " he said , shaking his head . " I know how you 've always cared about keeping the school for the good old families . But the fact of the matter is ? " " I never kept Chelton for any good old families ! " Mr. Minturn exploded . " Well , you know what I mean , " Mr. Fuller continued , with the shrug of one who has no time for quibbles . " Tradition , noblesse oblige , old school tie and all that . Not that I 'm against it , mind you . " He held up a deprecating hand . " I 'm all for it . I think it 's terrific .

If a private school these days does n't have a couple of Jew boys and a jigaboo to show the tax people , it stands a chance of losing its tax exemption . " These remarks , delivered to a speechless Mr. Minturn in the lobby by the dining-hall just before the alumni and trustees went in to dinner , the culminating event of the jubilee , left him cold and shaken . When he had recovered himself sufficiently to answer , Fuller had already gone , to be replaced by the Bishop who was telling him something about the doors being open , that they were going in , and would he lead the way , please ? He walked slowly ahead , dazed , only dimly aware of the multitude that pressed behind him into the great Jacobean chamber ; he made his way mechanically through the long tables gleaming white and silver to the dais where the headmaster 's table was laid beneath the portrait of himself in clerical vestments , his own gray eyes staring at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the long , jumbled meal he saw his successor 's eyes upon him , timidly sympathetic , rapidly averted . For Knox had been watching him . And it suddenly burst on him that Knox knew ! It seemed to say , that brief , apologizing glance : " I 'm sorry , Mr. M. I could n't warn you . You had to find it out , did n't you ? For yourself ? " And still dazed , he saw the headmaster rise , as main speaker of the evening , and turn in his direction . " There is certainly no one in this room , " Knox was saying , " who has not come under the spell of Mr. M 's personality . Much has been said of this personality ; often has it been vaunted , and I will not take up your time tonight in idle reiteration . But I should like to point out what to me is the unique quality of Mr. M , which is his power , when we are with him , to make us , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least several sizes larger than our usual selves .

And if one has been at Chelton , can one ever quite forget his vision , can one ever entirely , however surrounded by compromise and practicality , forget that there is another way ? " Mr. Minturn found himself suddenly frozen by a picture that flashed across his mind , remembered from a day , oh , thirty years back , when he had taken his daughters to a vaudeville in Boston , of a small , frightened clown scampering about a darkened stage , unable to get out of the center of a round spotlight that remorselessly and tightly held him . And it broke upon him gradually that this indeed was he , or what he had been , that it was the he who had moved about Chelton for close on half a century , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary . Oh , true , the circle had shifted , constantly , to follow him , up and down halls and corridors , into darkest corners ; there had been no nook or cranny of Chelton life over which it had not cast its brilliant light . It showed things , yes , but not quite as they were . The board , the graduates , the boys themselves could be good , wanted , indeed , to be good , for the brief period in any day or month or year when they found themselves caught in that spotlight with quaint little Mr. M. Now , with retirement , the light had gone out , and he saw the dark . The dark that everyone else had always seen . The headmaster was ending now ; he bowed to Mr. Minturn as he took his seat , but as he did so , he shot him a final , telling look , communica-tive as only Arthur 's glances could be , a look that seemed to say that what Mr. Minturn had believed in , he believed in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the only image , when all was said and done , that a headmaster could really live by . It was this which in the end seemed to make them strange al-lies , isolated from the cubic yards of smoke and incomprehension that filled the air of the great hall around them . Mr. Minturn rose to his feet , and the applause died slowly away , scuttling into silent corners before the reverberating hushes . " I have only one thing to say , " he heard his voice , oddly low , sound out . " May each and every one of you live to have the joy that I have in knowing that his work is carried on . " The applause burst out again , almost frenzied now , and he had only a tumbled sense of the rest of the evening before he returned , accompanied by the whole board of trustees , to his little house . Somewhere in the background , as he left the hall , he caught a glimpse of two frightened faces , but he looked away . Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
