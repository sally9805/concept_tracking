THE RED FORT ( 383 pp. ) - James Leasor-Reynal ( $5 ) . <P> As history is written it seems only a long minute since the great subcontinent of India was ruled by a unique commercial enterprise called the East India Company . A century ago that rule came to a bloody end with the Indian Mutiny . In a splendid narrative , British Newsman James Leasor has brought a bewilderingly confused mass of material into focus where it belongs-on the Red Fort of Delhi and the old walled city where the last of the Moguls sat in splendor and squalor amid his treasure , eunuchs and his 700-year past . <P> The mutiny itself-mostly horror but also part farce-began , as the schoolbooks say , with the news that the new type of rifle cartridge issued to the East India Company 's troops was greased with beef and pork fat . One would be horrible to cow-venerating Hindus ; the other would be offensive to pork-abhorring Mohammedans . The troops in India were a fantastically mixed lot-and Indians do not mix well . There were not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria , and in the ranks discipline was snarled up in India 's ancient caste system , e.g. , a low-caste sergeant would kiss the feet of a Brahman private . <P> Not Cricket . The ordinary Indian soldier was called a sepoy , and there were 257,000 of them to 34,000 British troops in all India . Unhappily for the British , the Crimean War and a brace of local disasters had shown that the sahibs were not invincible . Also the Feringis ( Europeans ) were bigoted enough to abolish suttee . The rumor spread among Moslems and Hindus that the British were trying to make Christians of them . The greased cartridges hit a bull's-eye of hate , and at Meerut 85 sepoys refused duty . After a suitable court-martial , the older mutineers were shackled on parade to be carted off to the Andaman Islands , 600 miles off the Indian coast . Their comrades revolted , killed all the officers and wives they could find , unshackled the sepoys and , for want of another place to go , marched on Delhi . <P> Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee in the great swarming hive of India , sat the ancient Mohammedan King of Delhi , a company pensioner , who suddenly found himself the unwilling leader of what today might be called a national war of liberation . As the mutineers in their elaborate British uniforms streamed into his city , all the pious old gentleman could do was to ask them not to loot too much ( most of the British in Delhi were massacred in the first few days succeeding the mutiny ) and consult the entrails of a goat in the hope of a suitable augury . <P> Ladders over the Dead . Behind the city 's seven miles of wall , in control of masses of artillery , the rebels seemed to be sitting pretty . But slowly , despite a military organization like a Pentagon without a car pool ( there were only 273 miles of railway line in all India ) , the British moved to assault the walls they had fortified and the men they had trained . To move a division required several thousand bullocks . Elephants were the heavy-weapons carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their huge , rotting corpses littered the plains.
