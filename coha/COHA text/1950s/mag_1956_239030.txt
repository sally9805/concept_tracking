When Earl ( " Flattop " ) Smith was president of the National Association of Home Builders last autumn , he invited ten top Russian housing administrators for a 30-day tour of 13 U.S. cities . Returning the compliment this summer , the Russians conducted San Francisco 's Smith and 17 other American building experts on a Red-carpeted , 30-day junket through Soviet cities , gave them the best look at Soviet building that any U.S. group has ever had . Back in London last week the builders reported that Soviet construction moves at an impressively frantic pace , but that the workmanship is shoddy , the hand tools often primitive , the materials frequently second-rate . <P> The Americans also held out words of praise . They thought Stalingrad " beautiful " and Leningrad " magnificent . " Said Smith : " They 've done a great restoration job . They 've broadened streets , widened promenades , built parks and planted plenty of trees . " <P> Industry First . The visitors found that the biggest shortcoming in Soviet building is its overbalance . Top priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing a poor second . The Russians have leaned heavily on prefabricated building sections to offset the shortage of skilled labor , hoist them into place with eight-to ten-story-high cranes . Cracked one delegation member : " Anyone who calls it the Iron Curtain is outdated . It 's the Concrete Curtain . Brother , do they pour concrete ! " <P> In each giant new residential section , the builders saw highest priority awarded to cultural centers " verging on temples . " But the quality of workmanship in the residential centers was sloppy . Reported Smith : " Finishings and exteriors are done very badly . Parts slip off , and plastic or ceramic facings just do n't want to stay in place . This creates a maintenance problem for which the Russians are n't prepared . " Materials also looked bad , by American standards . " Paint rubs off easily , so we never walked close to walls . Water pipes get rusty , and wires are too narrow-gauge to light more than a 40-watt bulb . " <P> Transport is spotty , and bricks arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indoors , the Russians put in hardwood floors while construction is still under way ; by the time work is finished , floors are gouged and pitted . But Smith tempered his criticism with the reminder that " it 's unfair to relate their standards to our standards . The Russians are intelligent people with an insuperable housing shortage . There 's been a tremendous raising of standard of housing . They want to learn how to do better . " <P> Labor Last . Everywhere , the Russians solicited advice from the visitors , carefully noted their suggestions . So acute is the shortage of labor and hand tools that in one steel mill the Americans saw women carrying heavy materials on a pallet instead of a wheelbarrow . Smith said he told them : " If you were to take the steel from a single giant crane and use it to turn out good wheelbarrows , picks and trowels and then teach people how to use them , it would help you very much .
