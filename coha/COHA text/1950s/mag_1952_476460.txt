HENRY Nevinson never failed to voice his amazement at the occasional revelations of man 's original virtue ; Graham Greene , an even more acute observer , never conceals his irritation at the same spectacle , and , because he is so acute , he is perpetually irritated . There is always on his horizon " somebody who has betrayed one 's natural distrust of human nature , someone one has loved . " Facing up to this monstrous anomaly , Graham Greene has kept a stiff upper lip in the face of virtue for forty-eight years , but even those hostile blue eyes occasionally register a doubt , as when he reluctantly says , about his school days , " I do not think we were to blame ... it was from the masters we learnt our snobbery . " But the determination to be guilty at all costs comes out even in this qualified confession as it does in his shocked recollection that there was no " more appallingly innocent school in existence at that time " than Berkhamsted , where he was born in 1904 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the headmaster ) from 1915 to 1921 , when , at the age of seventeen , he left en route for lialliol . Graham Greene , like Harold Nicolson , writes with feverish nostalgia of his schooldays , which he hated , and , therefore , loves to recall . How much of this hatred is intellectual in its basis ? How much is merelyemotion recollected in hostility to life in general ? For those who have only known him in his later childhood it is difficult to say . We have his story of the boy of seventeen putting one live round in a six-shooter , spinning the chamber , putting the muzzle to his head , and pulling the trigger . " The chance , of course , was six to one in favor of life , " he has commented , and goes on to say , " How quickly one forgets one 's emotions . " The chance , of course , was not six to one . How quickly one forgets one 's arithmetic . But he did it six times , until it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But everyone else has been . Graham Greene is the world 's greatest master of the art of being bored without being boring . I T FOLLOWS that Graham Greene has a secret . No author is more frequently and continuously discussed , despite an almost conventional career , at least up to 1938 . Public school , university ( and Balliol at that ) , second class honors , engagement to a Catholic , conversion to Catholicism , marriage , journalism , two rejected novels , seven modestly successful novels ? such was the almost subnormal prelude to his first moderately best seller , Brighton Rock . But all this , combined with reviewing ( culminating in the literary editorship of the Spectator ) and a great deal of other journalism , present a picture , first and foremost , of an astonishing industry and a relentless purpose . Not for nothing the glitter in those blue eyes . " I am thinking about something quite different , " they tell you ; " what it is , you could never guess . " He means you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who puts the Four Last Things ( for the benefit of the uninstructed I should , perhaps , say that these are death , judgment , hell , and heaven ) first . But that judgment stops halfway . It is true , but not profoundly so , because it is only half the truth . He is the only man who has done this and made it pay . All this and money too . But that is not only genius , it is industry . He is , and he does not wish you to know it , an absolutely first-class man of business . When he was a publisher he always came into our office very early in the morning , and always , for the first moment or so , in his favorite pose ( rather seedy , his favorite adjective ) of a man who had not been particularly early to bed and might leave again at any moment to get rid of his hangover at the Dog and Duck . He had usually announced his intention of going to be bored before leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening had passed off he always replied with a look of intense pleasure , " It was all perfectly ghastly . " Then he would settle down to the serious business of the day , telephoning with rapid succession to his bank , to his stockbroker , to his insurance agent , to his literary agent , to a film company or two , and , if it was really a busy morning , to two or three editors . During these conversations the tortured conscience so frequently and so movingly on exhibition in his novels was notably absent . There was no element of doubt , no uneasiness . There is at least as much of the " Man Within " in the easy certainties implicit in the titles of the three novels of his maturity ? The Power and the Glory , The Heart of the Matter , The End of the Affair ? as in the un-ease with which the characters within the covers of these very fine books wrestle with the problem of good and evil , which is central to all Graham Greene 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned with good and evil , Greene is therefore a religious novelist . If , however , his characters have discovered a sense of sin , they have not set their feet in the way of salvation . His novels tell the story of the fall of man but not of his redemption . They are the novels of a man profoundly concerned with moral problems who himself holds to the faith of the Catholic Church , but his treatment of his themes is severely objective . His books , although deeply concerned with faith , throw no light whatever on the interaction of religion and morality , of faith on works . The simple beliefs and corresponding habits of the regular churchgoer appear , indeed , to arouse in Graham Greene a certain revulsion . It could hardly be a coincidence , indeed it certainly is not , that the protagonists of his three most discussed novels are a drunken and unchaste priest , a corrupted official , and the wife of a civil servant who is the mistress of a " seedy " novelist . Two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero of The Heart of the Matter has not . He has only the unheroic virtue of pity , which destroys him as far as this world is concerned . But if these characters are saved , and Graham Greene has assured Time magazine that they are , it is not by the practice of their religion . All three live , and one of them dies , in defiance of its precepts . Salvation does not come to them by prayer , fasting , and alms-deeds . Grace is given , Graham Greene would perhaps say ? for as an instructed Catholic he knows that without grace there can be no salvation ? because in their curious and separate and secret ways , these people have come to love God . But we are not let into their secret unless it be , to use words which Greene writes about people like himself in his boyhood , " because in His eyes they can imagine themselves remaining always drab , seedy , unsuccessful , and therefore worthy of notice . " In all this chatter about Graham Greene as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in religion and being religious . It was after all the penitence of the penitent thief , not his thieving , which won him salvation . And that , in fact , is the heart of the matter and the end of the affair . The power of his three last novels , and also of his magnificent first novel , The Man Within , lies not in any profundity of analysis or in conveying religious experience , but in the creation of a living world of inescapable reality in which everything is true except one thing , the action of the central figure . It is the recipe for farce inverted to provide a startling tragedy which compels the unwilling assent of the reader and makes him , in assenting , an accomplice in the guilt of the protagonists but not a partner in their salvation . The dangerous , excited child is still , indeed , with us , the child who , playing with the revolver , wanted the sin without the guilt and now , in his maturity , wants the guilt without the sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself simply , than Graham Greene . His club must be what he calls " the seedy club " ; if he goes to a party it must be " simply appalling " or " perfectly ghastly " ; even a quiet cocktail with two or three friends becomes , on leaving , " a dreary little drink . " Time not wasted is time misspent ? and opportunity for remorse needlessly foregone . But before the day 's play-acting , the telephone calls will have been made , the five hundred words written , the complicated schedule of his real life worked over once again so that the novel , the film script , the latest journalistic assignments in China , in Malaya , in Timbuctoo , or at the North Pole , will all be punctually completed . Then the play-acting can begin again , but the plot is more likely to be concerned with " Mrs. Montgomery " than with any femme fatale . " Who is " Mrs. Montgomery " ? The answer must be that there is no such person . She was invented to lighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has had many successors in other fields . She began , with us , as the author of a manuscript lost in the office and , not unnaturally , never found . In her righteous anger she summoned all and sundry by telephone to urgent meetings at impossible times in inconvenient places . Meanwhile , she took more concrete shape in the columns of the Spectator , when her biographer asked for those in possession of any letters of hers the loan of them ? a request which provoked a reply from " Mrs. Montgomery " protesting that the proposed biography was an unauthorized and impertinent intrusion on a life which she wished to remain private . While all this was going on ? and it went on for three weeks or more ? life was full of surprises . The spotlight fell on all Graham 's colleagues , past and present , in turn . Infuriated messages or impassioned appeals from " Mrs. Montgomery " reached city board rooms , or were conveyed to all and sundry by embarrassed headwaiters or butlers . One day , trying to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietor of our favorite bar if he had seen " Mrs. Montgomery , " to be met with an enraged complaint that I was the sixth person who that morning had been badgering him about her . The next one who did so would be thrown out . He was ! It was the care for detail , the meticulous attention to the psychology of the different recipients of messages and letters , the timing , the carefully concocted atmosphere of authenticity and urgency , which kept " Mrs. Montgomery " alive among us for so long . Here for once the whole of Graham Greene was at work in a harmonious universe of his own choosing ? the mischievous child , the brilliant man of affairs , the creator of entertainments , the writer of film scripts , and the psychological analyst . Only the power and the glory were ephemeral . THE story has a moral . Graham Greene lacks a theme . Technically he is beyond question the finest living novelist , bar one , in our language . Intellectually he has no need to fear any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees the business of living as a form of self-indulgence which , to he worth while , must be dangerous and , to be justifiable , must he unsuccessful . " One could only hope , " he has written of himself , " that the failure would not he held off for too long . " But , for all this , he will not forego his in-surance policies which cover all contin-0crencies in this world if not in the next . One day he will face the risks of simple virtue in a world not of his own invention , risks which have to be faced alone and without any insurance , where failure is not permis-sible . Then he will write the greater books world rightly expects of him and friends believe to be within his
