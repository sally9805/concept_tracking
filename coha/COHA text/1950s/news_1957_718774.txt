Nowhere else is the Republican party undergoing a " more dynamic change , " the President said in a telephone message to sixty delegates to a regional conference on Republican strategy for 1958 . He called for " a stronger , completely up-to-date Republican party " for the " all-important and urgent task " of electing a Ilentiblican House and Senate in 1958 .

The delegates sat attentively as the President 's words boomed from a loudspeaker into the ballroom of the Sheraton-Biltmore Ilotel . A portrait of the President hung under the speaker box .

Several expressed gratitude that the President , " with the Sixth Fleet steaming through the Mediterranean , should be able to find time to give us his support . " Pending a formal news conference after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific discussions .

" At a press conference earlier , Dr. Hauge said that " there is , nothing in the budget that was not laid out squarely in the platform . " Dr. Hauge told the delegates that the nation " can look forward " to an eventual tax cut .

" He did not specify the date . Dr. Hauge told his press I conference that barring a major development on some other front , the national economy well might continue on the rise into 1960 . In his telephone talk , President Eisenhower noted that returns from the November election for top offices on the Republican ticket were larger in all six New England states than they were in 1952 . The President said he was pleased that much of this gain came in the many industrial areas of New England . This apparent growing approval of the Administration 's program by working men and women , he continued , shows that " they are beginning to understand that it is the Republican party that is really concerned with them and their Felfare . " PreSident Eisenhower described as a " healthy condition " differences of opinion within the party . Such differences , he said , can be resolved as long as there is adherence to fundamental beliefs .
