Dawson Trotman clambered back into a motorboat one day last week after two hours of waterskiing on Schroon Lake , N.Y . He was dog-tired , but before he settled down he asked one of the two girls in the boat , Allene Beck , if she could swim ; when she shook her head , he traded places with her so she would be in a safer spot . Minutes later the speeding boat bounced on a wave , and both of them , the 50-year-old man and the girl , shot into the water . He swam to her and held her head above water until the boat could circle back and she was hauled aboard . But as hands reached down to seize Trotman 's hand , he sank out of sight . <P> So died Dawson Trotman , " the Navigator , " light and power of a movement that echoes the words of the Scriptures around the world . Billy Graham interrupted his evangelist crusade in Oklahoma City to " preach his funeral " at Colorado Springs , Colo. , and devoted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preacher Charles E.

" He was courting a girl named Lila , as religious as she was pretty , and she took him with her to some church meetings . At the second meeting Dawson was the only one there who had memorized six Bible verses that had been assigned at the first meeting . The same thing happened at the third meeting . The following week he was " taken of the Lord , " converted to evangelistic Christianity , and welcomed to membership in the interdenominational Church of the Open Door in Los Angeles . <P> Memorizing the Bible was the key to conversion , as Trotman saw it , so he handed out scores of Scriptures to youth groups he organized .

A few minutes later , Trotman had talked the cop into joining him and the sailor in a session of prayer . The sailor said : " I 'd give my right arm if I could do what you just did .

For that sailor converted a friend with the technique he had learned from Dawson Trotman , and that convert in turn convinced another . Soon Navigators were spread across the seven seas . At one point during the war there were Navigators in more than 1,000 U.S. Navy ships and stations . <P> B Rations . Evangelist Graham urged Daws Trotman to join his Fort Worth crusade in 1951 , and asked him how to keep people to their religious conviction once they had made their " decisions " and signed their pledge cards .
