For four months , blonde , Tampa-born Dr. Deborah Coggins , 32 , served as the first woman health officer of Florida 's Madison . Taylor and Jefferson counties . One day last August , she was consulting with Ethel Kirkland , who is in charge of the Florida State Board of Health 's mid wife training program . Dr. Coggins suggested that they carry on business over their lunch . Because Ethel Kirkland is a Negro , Dr. Coggins carefully asked the manager of the Madison Hotel ( allwhite ) restaurant if they could use a private room ; the manager did not object , and neither did anybody else except-as Dr. Coggins thought about it later- " maybe the waitress . " <P> <P> Last week in a public meeting , the three county commissions heeded a growing public uproar , in effect kicked Dr. Coggins out of her job . She had had no hearing ; the protests of state officials and a couple of local residents that her " indiscretion " be " forgiven " were overruled . " Fire her ! Fire her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we give one inch , we are going to give the whole thing . It is time to stand up and be white men , not jellybacks . " When one of Dr. Coggins ' friends asked a county commissioner if he had not eaten with Negroes on hunting trips , he replied : " They eat after we 're through . " Florida 's Governor LeRoy Collins angrily denounced the firing . " I am sick about it ... an evil act , " but Collins had no power to intervene . <P> Amid all the tumult Dr. Coggins painstakingly sidestepped a martyr 's role . " I should have known better , " she explained to a reporter . " But I was n't sponsoring integration ; I was just doing my job . Look , this is a small community . " Then she added : " I guess saying that , I sound like I 've been brainwashed . Well , maybe I have . I do n't know . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
