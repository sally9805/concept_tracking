In Chicago 's Grant Hospital one morning last week , half a dozen physicians gathered for the regular meeting of their medical audit committee . The meeting , like those over the past five years , was devoted to a businesslike examination of the hospital 's medical records of the week . In perhaps the most important part of the session , the doctors considered the " tissue reports " of the pathology department . Their main concerns : 1 ) to see whether parts of the body removed by surgery were really diseased , 2 ) to see to what extent preoperative diagnosis had been confirmed by surgery . <P> By one name or another , medical audit committees and tissue committees are becoming common in U.S. hospitals . The American College of Surgeons has been recommending them for a dozen years , and in 1952 the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals* ruled that no hospital may be fully accredited that does not maintain some such systematic review of surgery . Now , the commission reported this week , 3,418 of the 7,500 hospitals of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men most responsible for the new trend is salty , 7 2-year-old Dr. Malcolm T. MacEachern of Chicago , longtime head of the hospital-standardization program of the American College of Surgeons . " When I came on the job in the ' 20s , " says Dr. MacEachern , " tissue specimens were thrown into a pail . Nobody bothered to save them . " <P> Once a systematic study of surgery specimens began , MacEachern and others set out to determine , if they could , the dividing line between necessary and unnecessary surgery . In the year 's work of any surgeon , they decided , the removal of a certain amount of healthy tissue is " justifiable . " This is partly because of honest mistakes in diagnosis ( an appendix may turn out not to be inflamed , after all ) , partly because some patients are sold on surgery and demand it as a cure-all ( many middle-aged women with vague symptoms beg for hysterectomies ) . <P> How much removal of healthy tissue is " justifiable " is still an open question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of healthy tissue removals exceeds 15% will be asked to explain himself to the tissue committee and , if need be , to the hospital 's executive committee . The ultimate penalty of suspension is rarely necessary . <P> The possible effect of this kind of scrutiny was reported in an A.M.A. conference last fall . When a tissue committee was first set up in St. Mary 's Hospital , Passaic , N.J. five years ago , one appendectomy in every five was found to be unjustified . Current rate : only one in 20 . <P> <P> * Membership : American College of Surgeons , American Medical Association , American Hospital Association , American College of Physicians , Canadian Medical Association
