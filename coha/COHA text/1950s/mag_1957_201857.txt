At the height of the Suez crisis , Chicago 's Marsh &; McLennan Inc. , one of the world 's biggest and most diversified industrial-insurance brokers , got a hurry-up call from the U.N . Would M. &; M. take on the job of placing insurance for the U.N . ' s 4,000-man police force in the Middle East against the hazards of war ? Though M. &; M. had never heard of such insurance being written before by a private company , it lost no time protecting the international force . Within 24 hours it had arranged for Continental Casualty Co. to write a $25,000 **34;11385;TOOLONG insurance policy for each U.N . soldier , plus $1,900,000 worth of war-risk insurance on each of three Swiss airline transports . <P> The U.N . ' s special insurance problem was all in a day 's work for Marsh &; McLennan . " We insure anything , " says President Herman Dunlap ( " Dutch " ) Smith . Like Lloyds of London , M. &; M. has grown big ( 2,720 employees , offices in 29 U.S. and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will as gladly work out insurance for a $20,000 cotton shipment as a $2,000,000 offshore oil-drilling rig , or a $20 million pipeline . While M. &; M. does not carry the actual fire , casualty , loss , or accident insurance itself , it acts as an expert broker , helping companies place their insurance as cheaply as possible . One result of such diversification is that while many casualty insurance firms hit rocky going in 1956 , M. &; M. wound up its best year , handled total premiums worth hundreds of millions , totted up gross revenues of more than $20 million from commissions and other services , and a big ( though traditionally secret ) profit 25% better than 1955 . <P> Coattail Rider . The secret of M. &M.'s; success is that it decided early to tie itself to U.S. industry 's flying coattails , and provide the kind of risk-cutting insurance businessmen needed . " Our free economy , " says President Smith , " is based on the confidence that comes from insurance . If it were n't for insurance , a man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be eager to drive a car or build a home . " <P> When Marsh &; McLennan was founded in 1871 , insurance policies were still written in longhand , and the agent rash enough to book as much as $5,000 subject to a single loss was nicknamed " jumbo . " But Henry W. Marsh , an agile , fast-talking supersalesman , and Donald R. McLennan , a careful technician who knew how to make salesmanship pay off , soon changed all that . M. &; M. advised the Moore Brothers ' Diamond Match Co. and National Biscuit Co. empire , won the insurance account for what later became U.S. Steel , convinced the Great Northern Railway that it should place its first comprehensive insurance schedule covering all the road 's operations . Going into marine insurance , it helped change the entire meaning of the term to cover virtually any cargo that was moved and stored , whether by land or sea . And for every customer , M. &; M. did its best to cut costs , helping them to take more insurance at lower rates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. &; T. boosted its insurance from $52 million to $770 million , in no small measure because M. &; M. was able to help it reduce its average premiums from 67 per $100 of insurance to 10 per $100.
