One of the more simptico of recent public figures in Argentina was Eva Pern 's lively , silver miniature French poodle Negrita . Whether at work at the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare , or at home to greet distinguished visitors , Negrita and Evita were almost inseparable . When Negrita died last August , Argentine representatives abroad were asked to find a replacement . <P> A male named Tambour , born of the same parents as Negrita , was found in Port-au-Prince and rushed to the First Lady . Soon he was well settled into his late sister 's old routine . He was a disappointment in only one way ; whereas Negrita was born black and later turned silver , Tambour remained all black . <P> When brisk , breezy U.S. Ambassador Stanton Griffis made his first official call on Seora Pern at her ministry last month , he met Tambour and presently suggested that the dog ought to have a mate . The Seora agreed . Griffis telephoned his New York secretary , and within 48 hours Sylvia , a six-month-old silver poodle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her formal presentation at the Casa Rosada last week , Sylvia was accompanied by Ambassador Griffis and his second in command , Lester Mallory . While the dogs made friends , Evita expressed her thanks and leveled a gay shaft at Grass Widower Griffis. * " Now that you have found a wife for Tambour , " she smiled archly , " I shall have to find you a wife among our descamisadas . " <P> <P> *Once married to handsome Whitney Bourne , sometime cinemactress , 24 years his junior .
