When the basketball scandals broke like carbuncles on the red neck of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden ( TIME , Jan. 29 et seq . ) , Illinois ' Bradley University was as horrified as any of them . Last spring Bradley staged its own private invitation tournament , to make sure that its team , known as the " Pride of Peoria , " kept uncontaminated . Last week Peoria 's pride came a cropper . Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan announced that eight Bradley players , including All-America Gene Melchiorre , had been hand in glove with gamblers . Also involved : four members of Toledo University 's team . For 13 years a group of alleged musicians , calling themselves the Dodger Symphony Band , have tootled happily and horribly around Brooklyn 's Ebbets Field . Last week Local 802 , American Federation of Musicians , ruled that the SymPhony could no longer play for free ( two of the seven-man band are A.F.M. union members ) . Kings County Judge Samuel Leibowitz , known as " Brooklyn 's No.1 Baseball Fan , " promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unions , but these people are not musicians . Their loss would rob Brooklyn fans of one of the most important emotional experiences they can have . " West Germany 's Gottfried von Cramm , 42 , still playing the sweeping all-court game that made him a prewar Wimbledon finalist three years running , carried his team into the finals of the European Davis Cup championships with victories over Yugoslavia , Denmark , Belgium and Italy . Last week , in Bastad , Sweden , Von Cramm got his comeuppance . Sweden 's Davis Cuppers Lennart Bergelin and Sven Davidsson crushed West Germany , 5-0 . The University of Nevada joined a growing list* of U.S. colleges who have dropped intercollegiate football . The Nevada regents had good reason : the team would cost $42,000 , and last year lost nine of its ten games . <P> <P> *St .
