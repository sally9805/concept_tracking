" There are two accepted ways to win a game , " intoned Dodger President Walter O'Malley with a tight little smile , " the easy way and the hard way . But these guys always do it the Dodger way , and it 's always nerve-racking . " <P> Last year the Los Angeles Dodgers finished in seventh place , a dismal 21 games from the top . This year the team had no pitcher that could win 20 games , no slugger challenging for the home-run or runs-batted-in titles , and the best-hitting regular was Wally Moon with a bare .300 . But at the start of last week , the Dodgers galumphed into the lead by shattering the league-leading Giants in three successive games , unceremoniously tumbling them from first to third . <P> Return of the Pros . The Los Angeles Dodgers had moved in an aura of Hollywood make-believe all season long . Too many experiments were working out too well . Brought up from Spokane , a gutty little Negro shortstop named Maury Wills turned into a fielding flash . Pulled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big hole at third . Picked up from St. Louis , craggy-browed Outfielder Moon , 29 , lifted the team with his slashing play . The big pitcher turned out to be Roger Craig , 28 , a lanky , laconic righthander , who had a horrendous 5-17 record last year at St. Paul . This year Craig developed an assortment of soft stuff to go with his fastball , by last week had compiled a 10-5 record and an earned-run average of 2.13 , lowest of any starter in the league . <P> But the biggest Hollywood business about the Dodgers was the comeback of veterans who had not starred since the glory days in Brooklyn . First Baseman Gil Hodges , 35 , was again tough in the clutch ( 79 runs-batted-in ) , despite a taped ankle and forearm . Although he often rode the bench when southpaws began to throw . Outfielder Duke Snider , 33 , had once again found his home-run bat ( 23 ) . The Dodgers were even getting mileage out of gimpy Carl Furillo , 37 , who explained : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs instead of stitches . " <P> Two Out of Three . Trouble was , San Francisco 's Giants and Milwaukee 's Braves were also seeing dollar signs . When the Dodgers blew a 12-2 game on the next-to-last day of the season , canny old ( 38 ) Warren Spahn curved the Braves into a first-place tie with a 3-2 victory over the Phils , to win the 267th game of his 15-season major-league career . The Giants ' Sad Sam ( " Toothpick " ) Jones . 33 ( TIME , Sept. 21 ) , had pitched so often that his battered right arm swung like a pendulum . But somehow Sam managed to no-hit the Cards 4-0 in a game stopped by rain after seven innings , kept his third-place team in contention . <P> On the last day of the season , the Giants blew it ; they lost to the Cardinals , 2-1 . But in Chicago , the Dodgers ' jug-eared Pitcher Craig was the soul of self-assurance ( " I 'm not cocky-I 'm confident " ) , threw his soft stuff at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win 7-1 . But the Braves stayed alive more because of Phillies ' boners than their own skills , won 5-2 . <P> In the best-two-out-of-three playoffs with the Braves this week , the Dodgers match their hard-pressed luck against a team that many baseball writers rated the world 's best at season 's start . Win or lose , the Dodgers were amazed to be there at all .
