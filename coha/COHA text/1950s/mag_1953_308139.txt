" The Revolutionary Force " <P> To a swelling chorus of businessmen demanding a reduction in U.S. tariffs the voice of Henry Ford II was added this week . The U.S. , said Ford Motor Co. ' s boss in a speech scheduled before the Inland Daily Press Association , " can and should step forth boldly and lead the free world toward freer trade " by elimination of all tariffs and other restrictions . In turn , " if foreign countries want American private capital , it 's fair to ask that they act in a way which will encourage the American investor " by " guarantees against expropriation of property and the elimination of inequitable double taxation . . . <P> " We businessmen constantly applaud competition and private enterprise , and damn socialism and planned economies . We accuse our foreign neighbors of lacking the kind of spirit which has made American industry great . We implore them to follow our example and get off our backs . So I just say , let 's practice what we preach , where it will do us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends a fair crack at the American market . . . I believe we ought to get rid of the 10% tariff on automobiles* at once .. <P> " We could easily absorb another five or six billion dollars ' worth of goods from abroad each year . . . When we consider . . . the great production edge we have on the rest of the world , it just is n't sensible-and courageous-to shake with fear at the thought that we might run into a little competition . . . One sure result of free trade with a prosperous free world is a greatly expanded market for the goods which American industry wants to sell . . . " <P> As steps toward this trade , the U.S. should : 1 ) write a new law to eliminate all tariffs as quickly as possible , 2 ) abandon the " Buy American Act " and quota system which " is contrary to every principle of free enterprise " because it permits only a fixed quantity of goods to enter the country , and 3 ) enact a workable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe this trade program can and should be sold on the basis of the practical self-interest it represents . Rightly or wrongly , the American people and most foreign peoples feel that American business will be a more powerful force in the councils of the new Administration . Rightly or wrongly , the Republican Party and industry are associated . . . with high tariffs and isolationism . <P> " I think private enterprise must make a head-on assault on these problems , based on the managerial know-how and the spirit of venture which is the soul of our capitalist economy . <P> " After all , what is needed more than American dollars and American goods in the world today is American business know-how . And by ' know-how ' I do not mean just the tricks and techniques of mass production . I mean our driving belief that no problem is insurmountable , and that nothing is being done as well as it could be done . This is the one truly revolutionary force in the world today . " <P> <P> * Three months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other automakers are members , also came out with a proposal to scrap all tariffs , said that free trade is " inevitable " ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) .
