1-10 A SUCCESSION OF DRAMATIC SHOTS from U. S. Navy files of Nazi sub warfare during the recent war , emphasizing the sinister , deadly striking force of the U-boats against lone , undefended ships at sea ... an upended freighter taking her final plunge ... the explosion of a torpedo against another vessel 's side ... the debris of a sunken ship floating on a sullen sea ... scattered lifeboats and rafts , containing survivors of a torpedoed ship , tossed about in rough weather ... the machine gunning by a U-boat of survivors in small boats ... FADE IN &nbsp; TITLE CARD OVER ABOVELess than a decade ago the year --  long battle that marked the turning point of World War II was fought and won : The Battle of the North Atlantic , the battle to keep the convoys moving to Murmansk and England . But great victories are always the sum of many victories , small and oftimes unrecorded ; and the true heros are always the unsung , the little people , whose common courage and fortitude make all victories possible . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the people who shared in it ... DISSOLVE  --  2  --  11 EXT . GLOUCESTER HARBOR - LATE AFTERNOON LONG SHOT  --  the trawler , Daniel Webster , sails furled and under power of its Diesel engine , making its way toward the Fish Wharf . The harbor is alive with other craft , most of them fishing boats . QUICK DISSOLVE 12 EXT . FISH WHARF - LATE AFTERNOON FULL SHOT as the trawler nudges alongside . There is an immediate stir of activity ashore , as with the unhurried proficiency of long-established routine the trawler is made fast forward and aft , a mobile unloading crane is moved into position , and a fifteen ton truck backs up to the boat 's side . 13 CLOSER ANGLE the trawler , broadside view . By the railing in the waist of the boat stands the trawler 's skipper , PAT BANNON ( DANA ANDREWS ) , watching the preparations to unload his catch . Except for his visored sea-going cap , he is dressed like the other members of his crew , in turtle-neck sweater , dungarees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give any orders , for none are necessary ; both the crew aboard and the wharfhands ashore proceed with their jobs with a minimum of fuss .

DISSOLVE 14 EXT . A STREET IN GLOUCESTER - LATE AFTERNOON LONG SHOT  --  Bannon , as he walks rapidly and rather purposefully toward the weatherbeaten hiring hall for the seamen of Gloucester . 15 INT . THE HIRING HALL It is a large place and its emptiness seems somehow foreign to it . The walls are covered with wartime pictures of all kinds , most of them union-slanted . The only people in the hall are two men sitting behind a counter . One , ( SHUSTER ) , is a jowled man in his thirties , dressed in shirt sleeves and suspenders . He is playing cards with a white-haired old seaman . Shuster looks up as the door opens and Pat Bannon stands there in the open door , still holding onto the knob and looking somewhat sourly at the emptiness of the big room .  --  4  --  &nbsp; SHUSTERPat . Quick trip . &nbsp; PAT ( in a not unfriendly tone ) It just seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's my fault . But it 's still the same story . Nobody for you .

He looks up and adds wryly : &nbsp; SHUSTERHis mother 's looking for work though . 16 CLOSE SHOT Bannon . &nbsp; PATI 'll laugh when you find me a man . He steps backs , closing the door . 17 EXT . THE STREET As Bannon walks away , continuing in the direction away from the harbor . DISSOLVE 18 EXT . AN ANCIENT GLOUCESTER ONE-STORY OFFICE BUILDING Bannon approaches the ground-floor entrance to the office of Kevin Dolan , Marine Insurance . Bannon gives the old-fashioned door-knocker a quick thump and pushes the door open . A BELL JANGLES inside .  --  5  --  19 INT . DOLAN 'S OFFICE As Bannon enters . Its furnishings are ancient , much --  used , and comfortable , the walls covered with seafaring souvenirs and pictures . Dolan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin stove . Dolan glances at Bannon and gets down another thick cup . &nbsp; DOLANWell , if it does n't look like the boy Patrick , himself . &nbsp; PATHello , Kevin . &nbsp; DOLAN ( pouring tea ) A cup of tea ? &nbsp; PATIf you 'll get it up on its feet . Dolan looks at him with interest , gets down a bottle of rum , and pours some into Bannon 's cup . &nbsp; DOLAN ( as he hands Bannon the steaming cup ) Have a good run ? Bannon takes the cup and drinks some of it . &nbsp; PATBetter than good . ( almost bitterly ) This war 's probably going to make a rich man out of me . &nbsp; DOLANDo n't take it out on me . &nbsp; PATYou put four kids in service . I get rich . Where does it leave us ? &nbsp; DOLAN ( as he sits down with his tea ) Without an argument . &nbsp; PATI 'd like an argument . ( drinks half the tea )  --  6  --  &nbsp; DOLANAll right . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this really get under your skin and you 'll decide to put the Daniel in dry dock and join the navy ... &nbsp; PATWrong . The Daniel stays afloat and I get rich . &nbsp; DOLAN ( as if Bannon has n't said anything ) ... and you know what 'll happen ? The navy 'll turn you down flat . They 'll tell you we need halibut a lot worse than they need Pat Bannon . Now for the first time Dolan grins faintly . Bannon looks at him quizzically for a moment and then grins back . &nbsp; PATYou know , Kevin , I think you 've been reading my mail . Bannon finishes his tea and Dolan gets up and pours him another cupfull , which has now steeped to a thick black . &nbsp; DOLANRum ? &nbsp; PAT ( looking at the tea ) Be a shame to weaken it . &nbsp; DOLANMy sentiments exactly . ( as he replenishes his own cup ) They help you any at the hiring hall ? &nbsp; PATNope . &nbsp; DOLAN ( sitting down ) Did n't say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; PAT ( suddenly alert ) What ?

But he 's a seaman and speaks fair English . &nbsp; PAT ( excitedly , standing ) Dolan , I would n't care if he could n't talk any better then you . Where is he ? &nbsp; DOLANHe 'll be here . Sit down . He 's at the court house  --  had his ship knocked out from under him a few days ago and lost his papers . &nbsp; PATHow do you know someone else wo n't ... ? He breaks off as the BELL JANGLES . They both turn to look . 20 MED . SHOT - MARGARET McLEAN She comes in slowly , carrying a heavy suitcase . She stands for a moment , then comes in closer and puts down the suitcase . &nbsp; MARGARET ( to Dolan ) I 'm looking for Captain Bannon . Dolan glances fleetingly at Pat , who looks away from the girl now and picks up his cup . &nbsp; DOLANI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . What shall I say 's wanted ? &nbsp; MARGARETI was told I might find him here .  --  8  --  She glances at Bannon , who sits down and casually drinks some tea . The girl looks back at Dolan , who has n't said anything . A little disconcerted by the silence the girl adds : &nbsp; MARGARETI 'd like to book passage on his ship . &nbsp; PAT ( with genuine surprise ) The Daniel 's a fisherman . She does n't take passengers . &nbsp; MARGARETI was told he 'd take me  --  if I offered to pay enough . &nbsp; PATAnd he 'd be happy to have your money . But unfortunately the Daniel does n't go anywhere . &nbsp; MARGARETDoes n't it usually put in at one of the villages on the coast of Newfoundland ? Sometimes at Trabo ? &nbsp; PATThat 's what I mean . &nbsp; MARGARET ( simply ) You 're Captain Bannon , are n't you ? Bannon nods . &nbsp; MARGARET ( continuing coolly ) I 'll pay you fifty dollars if you 'll drop me at Trabo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming around the Grand Banks . They like to use us for target drills . &nbsp; MARGARETI 'm willing to take ...  --  9  --  She breaks off as the BELL JANGLES once again and Conrad steps in . Bannon starts toward him . &nbsp; PAT ( over his shoulder to Margaret ) Sorry . I 'd like to help , but ... The girl looks after him as he steps up to Conrad . 21 TWO SHOT Bannon and Conrad . Conrad is a big man , young , blond , with large hands and the deep tan of the sea . He carries a duffel bag . &nbsp; PATYou 'd be Conrad . I 'm Bannon . &nbsp; CONRAD ( slowly , as they shake hands ) Mr. Dolan tells me about you . &nbsp; PATYou 're a seaman ? &nbsp; CONRADI am a Dane . It is the same thing . &nbsp; PATAnd you 're all squared away ? &nbsp; CONRADNo . I need employer to sign . &nbsp; PATWell , you 've got one . Let 's go . Bannon waves a good-bye at Dolan and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks embarrassedly at Dolan and picks up her bag . &nbsp; DOLAN ( picking up the ancient teapot ) A little tea might help . She looks at him almost coolly and then suddenly softens and puts down the bag . &nbsp; MARGARETI think it would ...  --  9A  --  &nbsp; DOLAN ( looks at rum bottle , a smile in his eyes ) And would you like it a bit upon its feet ? &nbsp; MARGARET ( looks at rum bottle  --  then smiles ) Ah  --  no  --  I do n't think so ... DISSOLVE  --  10  --  Section Details 22 EXT . WHARF - NIGHT MED . LONG SHOT  --  Bannon and Conrad as they approach the Daniel . The CAMERA PANS WITH them as they go aboard . 23 MED . SHOT Margaret McLain ( on board the Daniel ) . She is sitting on her suitcase near the companionway . She stands quickly as she sees Bannon , the CAMERA DRAWING BACK a bit to bring Conrad and Bannon into the SHOT . Bannon stops short when he sees her and Caleb crosses toward them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps back a bit toward the rail looking the ship over . Margaret stands stiffly , apparently determined to let Bannon make the first move . &nbsp; PAT ( to Caleb ) All hands aboard ? &nbsp; CALEBAye . And more ... &nbsp; PAT ( quietly to Margaret ) We 're shoving off . I 'm afraid you 'll have to go ashore . &nbsp; MARGARETWhy ? &nbsp; PATI think we covered that . But we 'd have nowhere to put you in any case . &nbsp; MARGARET ( flatly ) There 's an empty bunk in the galley . Bannon glances quickly at Caleb , who scowls and says : &nbsp; CALEBShe got no such information from me . &nbsp; PAT ( to Margaret ) Good old Dolan . Getting to Trabo must be a pretty big thing for you . &nbsp; MARGARETIt is.  --  11  --  &nbsp; PATWhy ? It 's a barren little stretch of rock with less than fifty people in it . &nbsp; MARGARET ( quietly ) I know . I was born there . ( pauses ) I 'm going to my father . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give in ? &nbsp; MARGARETNo . He said you probably would n't . &nbsp; PAT ( after a pause ) Have you seen the cook 's quarters ? &nbsp; MARGARETNo . &nbsp; PATShow her , Caleb. ( to Margaret ) I think you 'll be changing your mind . Caleb , with an air of unspoken protest leads the girl to the companionway and down . As they disappear : &nbsp; PAT ( calling ) And send Holger up . Bannon turns and crosses over to Conrad , who picks up his duffel bag and throws it over his shoulder . &nbsp; PATHolger 's a countryman of yours  --  from Lyksanger . He 's only made one trip with us but if you 're as good a sailor as he is , there 'll be no complaints .  --  11A  --  24 INT . COMPANIONWAY AT GALLEY - NIGHT Caleb is showing Margaret into the galley ; shouts off to the crew 's quarters : &nbsp; CALEBHolger ...

THE GALLEY - NIGHT Caleb switches on an overhead lights . The galley is little larger than a closet , with an old Diesel stove , a small sink and built-in cupboards and refrigerator . Caleb remains in the open door . He points to a closed door at the right side of the galley . &nbsp; CALEBThat 's it . Margaret opens the door . 26 MED . CLOSE SHOT the cook 's " quarters " over Margaret 's shoulder . It is a space no more than two feet wide and perhaps six feet long . Because of the inward slant of the ship 's sides , the bunk is at shoulder height . There is a tangle of dirty blankets on it . Over this SHOT we hear Holger and Conrad coming down the companionway to enter the fo'c'sle. 27 ANOTHER ANGLE as Margaret moves closer to have a better look . Caleb watches stolidly in the background . As Margaret steps back , Bannon appears beside Caleb in the open door and looks in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " the coffin . " &nbsp; MARGARETAre you offering it to me ? &nbsp; PATYou could n't take it ; not ten days of it . &nbsp; MARGARET ( closing the door ) I 'll be going with you . She steps out and Bannon pulls back to lot her pass . He exchanges a look with Caleb and the two of them start to follow her up the companionway . Margaret stops and turns to Bannon . &nbsp; MARGARET ( playing it straight ) I lied to you . Mr. Dolan did say you 'd give in.  --  13  --  27A INT . THE FO'C'SLE Holger and Conrad are there and Holger is pointing to a group of bunks and speaking in Danish . On another bunk OWEN , a man of forty-five or so , lies back with a pulp magazine in his hand . He is looking at Conrad . &nbsp; HOLGER ( in Danish ) All three of these bunks are unoccupied . You may take your choice . &nbsp; CONRAD ( in English ) It is better we speak English . &nbsp; HOLGEROh ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of the ship . &nbsp; HOLGER ( pleasantly ) As you like . &nbsp; CONRAD ( putting his duffel bag on one of the bunks ) The Captain says you are from Lyksanger . &nbsp; HOLGERYes . You know the town ? &nbsp; CONRADI was there once , before the new pier was finished . Holger looks at Conrad curiously for a long moment before he replies : &nbsp; HOLGER ( evenly ) There is no new pier in Lyksanger . Unless ... the Nazi 's have built one .  --  14  --  &nbsp; CONRAD ( pauses , frowns thoughtfully ) You are right . It was Esbjerg I am thinking of . Once again Holger gives him a sharp look and starts to say something when the SOUND of Margaret 's suitcase bumping down the companionway comes over . 28 INT .

Bannon crosses quickly over to her . 33 TWO SHOT Bannon and Margaret at rail . &nbsp; PATWe 'll be in the middle of that in a minute .  --  15  --  &nbsp; MARGARET ( peering at the black clouds ) More like four minutes . &nbsp; PATThe deck wo n't be the safest place for you . &nbsp; MARGARETI know .

Caleb keeps going but Bannon pauses in passing , looks at Margaret . &nbsp; PATNice , is n't it ?  --  17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful there 's so much of it . Bannon walks over beside her and looks out at the fog that presses thickly against them . &nbsp; PATYour friend Mr. Dolan once told me  --  a long time ago  --  that the sea does n't like brave men . It only tolerates the ones who 're afraid of her . &nbsp; MARGARETAre there any others ? &nbsp; PAT ( grins ) Living ? Margaret smiles and turns to him , when suddenly they are both arrested by the SOUND from a great distance  --  a machine gun firing several intermittent rounds . Stopping and then starting again . Both swivel to look ahead ; leaning against the rail , listening . The sound stops . Bannon leaves abruptly to move quickly forward . Margaret looks after him . FORWARD 44 MED .

Bannon moves to the aft door , sees it is unlocked . &nbsp; PATWho opened this door ? &nbsp; HOLGERI do not know .

As if learned from school . Bannon looks at both of them now with a kind of sour distaste . &nbsp; CONRADThe Captain is right to suspect . The Nazis have many men on American ships . They see convoys , subchasers , send reports to the U-boats . &nbsp; PATIn which case a radio might come in handy . &nbsp; CONRAD ( simply ) Yes . &nbsp; PATYou can go , Holger .
