Shortly before noon one day last week , Justice Robert H. Jackson made his final purchase in a Washington department store , got into his car and headed for the Supreme Court Building . On the way he suffered a heart attack . He drove to the nearby home of his secretary and , within minutes , Robert Houghwout Jackson was dead . In his 62 years he rose to eminence among lawyers , served with ability as U.S. Solicitor General and Attorney General , as Supreme Court Justice and as U.S. prosecutor at Nrnberg . When Jackson was named Attorney General , New Dealing Columnist Marquis Childs wrote : " If there is any single individual who represents all the qualities that commonly inhere in the term New Dealer , it is the man who has just been made Attorney General of the U.S. " But Robert Jackson could not be so easily defined ; he was a hard man to pigeonhole . <P> Born in Spring Creek , Pa. , a town his great-grandfather had helped found , he was reared as an Andrew Jacksonian Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after taking a two-year Albany Law School course in one year . His first clients were union men arrested in a violent transit strike . He got them acquitted . Before long he was vice president and general counsel of the Jamestown transit company . By the time he went to Washington , at 42 , Jackson 's abilities were widely recognized . His cases had included a $1,700,000 judgment , a hearing by lantern before a backwoods justice of the peace , and the defense of a Communist arrested for selling the Daily Worker on a public square . ( Years later he wrote in a Supreme Court opinion that to disregard Communists ' legal rights would be to " cast aside protection for the liberties of more worthy critics who may be in opposition to the Government of some future day . " ) <P> The $200 Million Credo . Franklin Roosevelt had an eye for such promising young men ; Jackson was brought to Washington as counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue . He landed right in the middle of a tremendously complicated tax suit against former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial : " It is Mr. Mellon 's credo that $200 million can do no wrong . Our offense consists in doubting it . " Mellon 's estate was forced to pay $700,000 in back taxes-and Bob Jackson took a big step upward in the New Deal hierarchy . <P> His way led to the position of Assistant Attorney General ( while in that job , Jackson ardently supported President Roosevelt 's effort to pack the Supreme Court ) , thence to Solicitor General and , in 1940 , to Attorney General . <P> Defending his role in the court-packing plan ( in a book published just before Jackson himself was named an Associate Justice ) , he pleaded eloquently for new blood in the court . There are , said he , " certain sustained and procedural pressures toward conservatism which only the most alert Justices will sense and only the most hardy will overcome . " <P> Jackson was to become one of the more conservative-minded members of the court . More often than not , he found himself in vigorous dissent from the liberal opinions of Justices Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
