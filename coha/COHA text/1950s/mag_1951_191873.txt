The Russians reported last week , not without a touch of pride , that they , too , could have their sports scandals . <P> The Central Asiatic Spartakiad-a tournament , including soccer , among five Central Asiatic Soviet Socialist Republics - was in full swing . The Alma Ata soccer team ( representing the Kazakh Republic ) was playing the Ashkhabad eleven ( representing Turkmenistan ) . Alma Ata was ahead in the game , but what counts in the Spartakiad is not the number of games won ; it is the number of goals scored . In goals , the Tashkent team ( representing Uzbekistan ) , which did not play that day , had a narrow lead . The game between Alma Ata and Ashkhabad reached a point where , if either of the teams scored two more goals , Tashkent would lose this edge . And this in turn would mean that in the overall tournament standings , Alma Ata would take the lead . <P> All this was clear to a man named Bekbayev , director of the Kazakhstan Institute of Physical Culture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeaker and ordered him to let the opposing team score two goals . Unlike fixers in acquisitive societies , such as people who rig games in Madison Square Garden , he did not offer the players money . Said Bekbayev , as Moscow 's Pravda reported the incident last week : " Is n't it a clever combination I thought up ? " Nevertheless , " the Kazakhstan athletes determinedly rejected Bekbayev 's proposal . They continued to strive for first place honestly , without machinations , as Soviet athletes should . " In fact , the outraged Alma Ata goalie kicked the ball into his own goal " in order to attract the attention of the stadium to the dishonest deal . " <P> The incident also drew the attention of the authorities to Bekbayev , who , reported Pravda , turned out to be an " ignoramus , bluffer and suppressor of self-criticism . " Among other crimes , he had only had a grade-school education and had issued himself two phony diplomas , one of them making him a " Master of Sports . " <P> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an end and the honor of dear old Alma Ata vindicated . So far , no committee of the Supreme Soviet has grilled Bekbayev on television , but an up &; coming commissar named Rudolf Tobeyevich Kefauversky is reportedly studying the U.S. record and getting ready to prove that anything the Americans can do , the Russians can do better .
