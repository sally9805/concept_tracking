SUBMARINE ( 301 pp. ) - Commander Edward L Beach-Holf ( $3.50 ) . <P> Ensign Edward L. Beach liked it where he was in the fall of 1941 . Just a couple of years out of Annapolis and only 23 , he was patrolling the Atlantic in an ugly old four-piper destroyer that , to his loyal eyes , looked " lovely . " When he was transferred to submarine school , he tried to have his orders rescinded . But he went , of course . On New Year 's Day , 1942 , he reported to his new home , U.S.S. Trigger ( SS 237 ) . Thought young Beach : " Wonder if I 'm looking at my coffin ? " Trigger did become a coffin for 89 men and officers in March 1944 , but by then , Lieut . Beach had been transferred to another sub . He lived through twelve longdistance war patrols , wound up as skipper of his own sub , today commands the new U.S.S. Trigger . He becomes , in Submarine , the first U.S. underwater fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war whose special triumphs and stresses were shared by no other service . Other books about the subs have been written ( TIME , March 5 , 1951 ) , but they were the work of desk brass . Author Beach saw all his war through periscopes , and heard it-with &; without audiophones-crashing vengefuily around him . It was a war of sights &; sounds , and Navyman Beach knows how to share them with his readers . <P> Tokyo Extravagance . The old Trigger 's first patrol began with the worst kind of embarrassment : within sight of Midway during the great battle with the Japanese fleet , she ran on to a coral reef and stuck . But next time out , there began the thrill of the chase and the underseas tension that were the normal climate of the subs . As in all forms of combat , the best of training was only partial preparation for the first attack and counterattack . Moving in for the kill , lining up the first ene my ship in the sights , the torpedoes crashing into the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then came the Japanese destroyers , the deep submersion , and the suspense at 300 feet below while depth charges searched for the sub , shaking her like a light bulb on a cord . The first time it happened to Trigger , Tokyo Rose claimed her sunk , then played a recording of Rocked in the Cra dle of the Deep . It was a characteristic Japanese extravagance : they claimed 468 subs in the course of the war . U.S. sub losses in the Pacific from all causes were 52 ships , 3,505 men . <P> In the beginning , the submarines had to contend with faulty torpedoes . Monotonously the patrol reports recited : " Torpedoes ran true . . . did n't explode . " Once they did begin to explode , Japan began to bleed to death . Says Beach : " In 1944 , approximately half of the ships departing from Japanese Empire ports found their final destination at the bottom . " <P> Submariners ' Due . Submarine is packed with crackling descriptions of action . There is the feat of Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subs ' greatest natural enemy , the destroyers , got five on one patrol , and came back to tell about it . There is an account of Commander J. K. Fyfe 's Bat fish , which stalked enemy sub marines and sank three in four days . And there is the near-incredible last patrol of Commander Richard O'Kane 's Tang , which sank eleven ships and was finally sent to the bottom by one of her own torpedoes .
