txt Fairchild Engine &; Airplane Corp . Hagerstown , Md , will begin aerodynamic tests this month on a scale model of a plane which can rise vertically by manipulating the downward thrust of Its slip stream , " according to W L. Landers , vice-president . The new air vehicle will be known as the ' Fledgling . ' and its development is part of a Si million research ' contract awarded Fairchild by the Army 's Transportation Research and Development Command . Construction of the actual test vehicle will begin about January 1 and is expected to he completed by next July . The Fledgling will probably weight under 5,000 pounds , a size comparable to one of the smaller helicopters . It will use turbine engines driving four propelleia. which aril force a large volume of air over the entire wing surface . Quick lift will be provided by two very large wing flaps which will cause the air to move downward and impart upward thrust . Fairchild said the Fledgling type of phicle would not only be useful to the military for taking off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held promise of being used as a commercial or military transport aircraft . Mr. Landers added that the Fledgling concept will substantially seduce the problems of costly maintenance and slow forward speed characteristic of helicopters , which have so far been used by the Army for vertical lift .
