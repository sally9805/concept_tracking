txt France tack measures tonight that amounted to a 20 per cent devaluation of the franc in all but name . Felix Gaillard , Minister of Fi ? nance , awaited the week-end closing of banks and exchanges before announcing measures to " put in order our foreign commerce . " In effect , these meant that for foreign purchasers of French goods and for foreign tourists $1 would buy 420 francs beginning tomorrow instead of 350 , the official rate since September , 1949 . This step was designed to help cure France 's basic current economic ill  --  an excess of imports over exports that was draining French gold and dollar reserves at the rate of $120,000,000 monthly . By cheapening the franc , M. Gaillard cheapened French exports in the hope that increased volume of sales would correct the dangerous trade gap . A. Parallel Measure M. Gaillard took a parallel step to operate on the other side of the balance  --  to cut the outgo by cutting non-essential imports . He imposed a 24 per cent tax on all imports except certain speci. fied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  coal and petroleum ? raw materials , wool and cotton , sulphur , steel products . The tax will affect about 60 per cent of all imports , leaving the vital 40 per cent free . On the same side of the ledger , M. Gaillard increased costs for Frenchmen going abroad by 20 per cent . Heretofore , French vacationers and business men have had the right to buy up to 35,000 francs ( $100 ) worth of foreign currencies at the official rate . Beginning tomorrow they will pay an extra 7,000 francs . One hundred dollars will cost 42,000 francs  --  again devaluation without putting that frightening name to it . Lower Prices Foreseen Action on the export side took the form of a premium of 20 per cent offered to French businesses that direct 50 per cent of their production into foreign markets . This will permit them to lower their prices by 20 per cent to attract new customers and increase sales to old ones . The full effect of the export premium probably will not be immediately apparent on prices of French goods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar , if less extensive , aids in the form of tax rebates and reimbursement of some o their social security costs . The Finance Minister tonight described the old system as " complicated , uncertain , limping and precarious . " But it was reasonable to expect that within the near future a bottle of champagne , a Dior he said , " unlimited in duration , which should permit the French economy to find a new basis for development . " France , suffering from a potentially fatal hemmorhage of her gold and foreign resources , last month reimposed the import quotas and other trade controls that the Organization for European Economic Cooperation has been working for ten years to remove gradually from the trade among the seventeen member countries . M. Gaillard said to= night he hoped the new franc rates would speed the day when France could again lift controls on exchanges with organization countries . M. Gaillard said he felt the actions today were long overdue . They would have been of even greater effectiveness if they had been taken as long ago as 1953 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in a better position and French prices and wages enjoyed an unusual period of relative stability . Such action then would have had none of the crisis atmosphere about it that the obviously threatening situation imposed today . of the franc . The measures were , It was apparent'that M. GailPARIS frock , a trim Dauphine automobile or a good , fragrant Camembert cheese all would cost less . If M. Gaillard has guessed correctly , Americans and others abroad will drink , wear , ride and eat more of all of them : Heretofore , there have been taxes on imports also but these , too , varied by categories and by their complexity offered loopholes through which many unnecessary luxuries from abroad filtered into France . The higher across-the-board tax on imports is expected to more than compensate for the reimbursements to exporters and lighten the French budget by about 40,000 , - 000,000 francs ( $114,000,000 at the official rate still applicable to French internal finances ) . M. Gaillard estimated that the easing of the franc rate for tourists would pour many millions of dollars into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where tourists purchased francs at higher free rates , or to black marketeers in France . Few were the tourists who bought all of their francs at the official rate of 350 to the dollar , reduced actually to as low to 346 by official exchange costs . For at least two years the rate on the " parallel market " ? euphemism of the financial pages for " black " transactions  --  has hovered around the 400 point . Last week , when the dwindling of French reserves became apparent and devaluation talk began , the unofficial rate jumped to 436 . On Friday it had dropped back to 424 , just four francs above the rate set by M. Gaillard ; Other Powers Informed The Finance Minister said foreign governments , the Organization for European Economic Cooperation and the European Payments Union had been informed in advance of the new measures .

By maintaining the rate for the franc officially unchanged -- except in . most of the aspects ; that mattered  --  the Government : obviously hoped to minimize the psychological effect .
