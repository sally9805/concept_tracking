New York City 's public transportation system has well earned its bad name . The city-run subways ( 237 miles ) and surface lines ( 554 miles ) are often slow , sporadic , smelly-and they are running $17 million in the red this year . Last week a private operator offered to relieve New York of this financial headache , reportedly was ready to pay upwards of $500 million in cash and bonds-give or take a few million-for the $2.1 billion transit system . Said O. ( for Oscar ) Roy Chalk , 51 , able admiral of D.C. Transit System , the national capital 's surface lines : " I 'd like to prove that private enterprise , with $1 , can go 50 times the distance that public enterprise can . " <P> Roy Chalk should know . He has run up a $10 million-plus fortune by making every dollar turn over many times-through borrowing . Son of a Russian immigrant shopkeeper , Chalk grew up in The Bronx ( his neighbors were George and Ira Gershwin , and he fielded sandlot grounders batted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Law School ( ' 31 ) . With loans and his skimpy earnings as a young attorney , he bought Bronx apartments at Depression prices , later cashed in on World War II 's real estate boom . Typical Chalk deal : in 1942 he bought the 16-story apartment house at 1010 Fifth Avenue ( corner of 82nd Street ) for $1,000,000 , putting up considerably less of his own cash . It is now worth upwards of $4,000,000 , and Roy Chalk lives there , has built a suburban-style ranch house on the roof for his daughter 's family . <P> Hoopla Pays . In 1945 , with only $60,000 , Chalk founded the nonsked Trans Caribbean Airways by buying two DC-3s , and within two years it was earning $60,000 annually . Trans Carib expanded to lift thousands of refugees from Europe to Israel , tons of airmail from Europe to South America , flew charter trips from Johannesburg to Jerusalem . It grew so strong that in 1957 it won a regular U.S.-Puerto Rico route , became the first nonsked passenger airline in 20 years to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year Trans Carib ( including its major subsidiary , D.C. Transit ) earned more than $1,000,000 , most of it for Chalk and his wife , who own 70% of the stock . <P> Three years ago Chalk bought Washington 's well-hated , strike-bound transit system from Louis Wolfson , who had milked it of millions . Chalk put up only $500,000 of his own money , borrowed $9,100,000 , plus a $3,900,000 mortgage , to take over a company with a book value of $27 million . He started out by painting Washington 's buses glaring green and coral , installed shapely stewardesses on streetcars , last summer rolled out 100 new buses ( 67 of them air-conditioned ) in a downtown parade with four bands , bathing beauties , clowns , calypso dancers . Hoopla-and hustling service-paid off with free publicity and profits . Last year Chalk 's D.C. Transit System , Inc. earned $500,000 , and Chalk finished paying off its $9,100,000 in bank loans-three years ahead of schedule .                 @ @ @ @
