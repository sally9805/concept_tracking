JOHN 'S , where old Celtic star Joe Lapchick is bringing the school back to its former preeminence in basketball at top speed . Lapchick has a tall , fast , deep squad , led by Tony Jackson , who rated All-America status as a sophomore last year . Senior Bernie Pascal is back after a year 's rest and recuperation from illness , so is slick Guard Mike Pedone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . They are LeRoy Ellis , 6 feet 9 and the tallest player here since Harry Boykoff ; Willie Hall and Fred Edelman , two rugged forwards ; and Ivan Kovac , a speedy , deceptive driver and play-maker . Reserves include Gary Marozas , Bob Larranga , Butch Dellecave , Frank O'Hara and Bill Goldy . On December 19 St. John 's faces another school aiming for national ranking , PROVIDENCE , and the similarities between them are striking . Providence also has a new , tall post man in Jimmy Hadnot , 6-foot-10 graduate of the same California high school that produced Bill Russell . He is stronger than Ellis and a better shooter but not as fast . Here , too , is a superb backcourtman , John Egan , who is recovering from a knee injury but who should be ready for the big game . The supporting cast , not as deep as St. John 's but about the same size , includes Len Wilkens , John Woods , Bob Gibson , Dick Whelan , Dennis Guimares , Dick Holzheimer , Tim Moynahan and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable this speedy bunch to fast-break often . ARMY , set to duplicate last year 's fine record , has been seriously hurt by the loss of three veterans before the first game . Joe Bobula was hospitalized with a back injury , Harold Hannon was operated on for shoulder trouble and Captain Jim Klosek was suspended for an infraction of Academy regulations . This leaves only regulars Lee Sager and Fred Kaiser , who look for help from reserves Bob Strauss and Ross Gagliano and sophomores Stu Sherard , Al Dejardin and Phil Thompson . At SETON HALL Honey Russell 's 19th and last year as coach should be one of his best . He has good size and speed , a veteran bench and three sophomores who supply the scoring punch sadly absent last season . Leading newcomers are Art Hicks , who scored more than 1,100 points in high school in Chicago , Hank Gunter and Al Senavitis . They will start with veterans Jack Rowley and Ken Walker , and reserves include Hugh Dunnion , Seth Hicks , Bill Brooks , Ron Olender and Angie Marotta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pivotmen . Taps Gallagher has exceptional speed and outside shooting , and great depth at the guards , one of whom , Al Butler , is tops in his area . Just fair rebounding is the chief drawback . The experienced regulars are Butler , Sal Vergopia , Don Jones and Len Whelan . Reserves include Bob Johnson , Bill McLaughlin , Bill Roberts , Buddy Salamone and Tom Truesdale . Nearby ST . BONAVEN-TURE has the two Stith brothers , Tom and Sam , as a nucleus , and the hope is that sophomore Bob McCully , 6 feet 9 , will come through at center so Tom can move to his accustomed spot in a corner . There he should score even more than his 403 points of last year , which set a Bonnie record . Sam is a fine floor leader and a good scorer himself . Except for Ron Martin and Bill Connery , the rest of the squad lacks experience . It includes Tom McHugh , Mickey Connelly , Tom Hannon , Orris Jirele and Ed Petrovick . FORDHAM gets some of the height it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement the fine shooting of veterans John Andariese , Pat O'Donnell and John Coalmon . Ira Sussman will play a lot also , and reserves include Frank Ascione , John Samon-sky , Don Altomare , Cornell Hess and Tom O'Connor . So-so boardwork is the rub . At VILLANOVA sophomore Hubie White should supply the offensive power that is the only ingredient the rest of the squad lacks . There is height , speed and experience . John Driscoll , Jim Huggard and Bob Liberatore are holdovers from the unbeaten frosh of two years ago , Captain George Raveling is set in the backcourt , and reserves include Donald McGinley , Jim McMonigle , Richard Kamanski , Tom Samulewicz and David Severance . The Wildcats will give St. Joseph 's and LaSalle a battle for Philadelphia area honors . Four regulars return at HOLY CROSS , and are joined by 6-foot-5 Jack Foley , who averaged a whopping 32 points with the freshmen last year . It is a deep , seasoned squad that shoots well from outside . The veterans are George Blaney , Tim Shea , Ralph Brandt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Connors , Paul Cervini , Al Attar and Ted Breslin . Other sophomores , who complete the squad , are Dave Slattery , Ken McClory and Bill Canavan . MANHATTAN has some experienced hands for a change , good over-all size and shooting that may be the best in the East . Bob Mealy has completely recovered from a shoulder separation and should be one of the nation 's best boardmen and a 20-point scorer . He is surrounded by veterans Joe Dougherty , Bob Cleary , Tom Leder , Pete Brunone and Charles Koenig . The bench consists of transfer student Arthur Orlando and sophomores Alex Osowick , Kevin Haggerty , John O'Connor , Larry Byrnes and Doug Rutnik . On a hot-shooting night this bunch will beat any of the local New York powerhouse teams . One of these is NYU , with veterans Tom Sanders and Al Barden up front and Russ Cunningham and sophomore speedster Ray Paprocky in the backcourt . The fifth man likely will be Jim Reiss , but Coach Lou Rossini can also choose from among Al Filardi , Mike DiNapoli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top reserve guard . NYU 's strength is in the speed of the first five and the powerful rebounding of Sanders and Barden ; its chief weakness is a great falling off in speed on the bench , PENN STATE faces a rugged early schedule , with only two good backcourtmen from last year 's winning season , Wally Colender and Mark DuMars . Elsewhere are inexperienced performers . Jon Musser and Paul Sweetland , reserves last season , must improve their boardwork , and sophomores Joe Bradshaw and Gene Harris have to gain poise quickly . The bench includes Dick Dibert , Larry Freedman , Mel Ramey , Don Wilson , Jake True-blood and Frank Shea . Unusual in a profession brimful of long-faced Cassandras is the perennially optimistic Dr. Skip Hughes , coach at ST . FRANCIS , who , happily , can count on a tall , well-balanced , speedy squad for a winning season . The veteran front line of Joe Aston , Wilbur Trosch and Bob Jones averages 6 feet 6 , with equally rangy reserves in Don Crawford , Jerry Lacey and Mike Matta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced depth but provides fair shooting . Frank Libonati and sophomores Calvin Fowler and Ed Winters are available for the fifth starting spot . Rebounding is the potent weapon here . At SYRACUSE it is missing . Four speedy veterans are desperately shy of board strength , but they shoot well and have a fair bench behind them . Ed Goldberg is a fine playmaker , and he has holdovers Dick Conover , Pete Chudy and Tom Mossey with him . Hopefully , the rebounding will come from tall reserves Doug Yarnell , John Chaney and Bruce Kollath . Backcourt subs are Steve Berkenfeld , Sandy Salz and John Mustion . Don Hennon is gone at PITTSBURGH , which means a great loss in scoring punch , and there is also no one in sight to improve the weak rebounding situation . Veterans John Mills and John Fridley are the nucleus of a front line that probably will be completed by Darwin Smith , with sophomore Bob Sankey also in contention . The backcourt will come from among Dick Falenski , Bill Mauro and Howard Lockhart , and reserves are Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts from scratch , after losing 10 top players . Coach Don Martin has three good shooters , Jack Schoppmeyer , Jim Hooley and Bill Donovan , and hopes his two big men , Frank Quinn and Rudy Von Burg , develop quickly so he can use a double-post offense . The backcourt will be manned by Donovan , Bill Foley , Jack McAuliffe and Ray Falvey . Reserves include Vin McKeever and Bryan Fitzpatrick . CANISIUS has high scorer Frank Rojek but no one to help him in that department unless four sophomores come along fast . They are Phil Skilnik , Frank Slazyk , Bill Slicks and Bill Kretzer ; the first two may start . Other returning veterans are John Gabbey and Ray McGuire , and reserves are Larry Sarafinas , Dick McCann and Joe LoTurco . New Coach Bob MacKinnon returns to the scene of his playing days , but his debut will be a trying one . The usual personnel situation is reversed at DUQUESNE , where Coach Red Manning has plenty of height and rebounding power but needs two fast little ball handlers who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but kicked him and substitute Mike Wolff off the squad because of their " indifferent attitude . " The solid front line includes pivotman Bob Slobodnik , George Brown and Frank Grebowski , with Ron Cygrenus , Paul Benec and Clyde Arnold in reserve . The guards likely will be sophomores Bill Strom and Bill Stromple , though Benec may be switched back there . At CCNY Nat Holman begins his 37th season as coach with three good veterans , a flock of enthusiastic candidates , practically no height and the prospect of meeting all of the local powers this year . He must build around Marty Groveman , Guy Marcot and Julio Delatorre . The fine BOSTON UNIVERSITY squad that beat Navy and Connecticut and went to the quarter-finals of the NCAA tournament last season is sadly depleted . Only Bill Gates and Dick O'Connell are back , the sophomore crop is disappointing and new Coach Johnny Burke has a minimum of manpower from which to choose . Newcomer Larry Isenberg probably will start with the two veterans , and the others must come from among John Alexander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilt and Lee Crutchfield. // MIDWEST : No one should have been surprised when Eddie Hickey came up with a good team at MARQUETTE last year , even though it was his first season . And this year the Warriors may be even tougher . Hickey 's one problem is at center , but it may be solved by sophomore John Reitinger or Jerry Doyle , who had dropped basketball in favor of the books . If neither works out , veteran Don Kojis will handle the pivot , with no loss of effectiveness there , but that will weaken the forward positions . Also back are jumping jack Walt Mangham and playmaker Jim Kollar , plus a long list of reserves : Jim Kersten , Ed Carter , Tim Rogan , Gregory Ripp and Joel Plinska . Sophomore Jerry Keidel , Joe Scanlon and Reitinger are potential starters , and Mario Crivello and Patrick Below will make the squad , DAYTON has excellent height and scoring potential , good depth and a solid core of veterans . High-scoring Frank Case , Terry Bockhorn and Tom Hatton will handle the backcourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 feet 8 , will alternate in the post , and Gary Roggenburk , who averaged 20 points and 20 rebounds per game with last year 's frosh , brings more power up front . Others who will play a lot are Pat Allen , Phil Dubensky , Bill Cramsey and Hank Josefczyk . DETROIT counts on newcomers Dave DeBusschere and Charlie North to bring needed scoring and rebounding strength to go with Ray Albee 's playmaking . Veterans George Heger and Larry Hughes are also back , and two other sophomores , Tom Villemure and Frank Chickowski , are potential backcourt starters . Reserves include Bob Wright , Tom Stumb , Pete Corbett and Dick Dylus . At LOYOLA OF CHICAGO 20-point man Clarence Red returns to his natural position in the corner , as center Jim Gorman , recovered from his knee operation , takes over the pivot . The result is a great increase in scoring potential for this fast , deep , veteran squad . Other sure starters are Marty Norville and Jimmy Mini in the backcourt . The second forward spot will go to Greg Griffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ron Schwingen , Ron Beals and Al Denenberg . All five regulars who took DE PAUL to the second round of the NCAA tournament are back , but Coach Ray Meyer is still looking for some height to go with his speedy collection of good shooters . Rebounding is Meyer 's implacable problem , but he has a great backcourt performer in Howie Carl , and hopes for more scoring from Jim Flemming in the post . The other veterans are Bill Haig , McKinley Cowsen and Mike Salzinski . Sophomore Elgin Dorsey is a potential starter up front , and reserves are John Bagley , Paul Ruddy , John Incardone and Dick Flaiz . XAVIER lost its two top scorers but has three newcomers who led last year 's frosh to a 15-1 season and can field a very tall , surprisingly fast first five . The sophomores are Jack Thobe , 6 feet 8 , Frank Pinchback and Billy Kirvin . Returning regulars are Rich Piontek and Ron Nicolai ( both 6 feet 8 ) , Ducky Castelle , Al Gundrum , Jim Haffner and Charlie Phillips ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jannott , Bill Middendorf and Ed Tepe . NOTRE DAME surely will miss All-America Tom Hawkins and Gene Duffy , but the squad 's biggest problem is its poor shooting . The size and rebounding are fair and there is adequate depth at all positions . Veteran starters are Mike Graney and John Tully , and leading sophomore candidates are Eddie Schnurr and Armand Reo . Other regulars will come from last year 's reserves : Mickey Bekelja , Bill Crosby , Mike Farrell , Emmett McCarthy , Bill Noonan , Don McGann , Bob Skrzycki , Ray Vales and Denny Walljasper . BUTLER again takes on most of the Big Ten powers but does not appear up to the task this time . Ken Pennington , Jim Barrick , Larry Ramey and Orville Bose are a sound nucleus , and Larry Johnson may move up from last year 's freshmen , but there is a bare minimum of size and not enough scoring punch . // SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST : Six lettermen , including four regulars from NAVY 'S giant-killers of last year , are back and in their usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall ( regulations limit the Academy to 6-foot-6 personnel ) but always ready to run all night . Navy scored major upsets against both North Carolina and St. Joseph 's in the NCAA tournament last March . One of the major weapons in its arsenal is Coach Ben Carnevale 's very effective " adjusting " defense , which , like several in use today , combines a basic man-to-man approach with zone principles as the opponent develops his attack . Carnevale has the disciplined , balanced squad to make it work . His veterans are front courtmen Jay Metzler and Jim Bower , the two top scorers , and Guards Dick Brown and Frank Delano . The fifth starter will be either Hank Egan or Walt Land , and the bench includes Al Hughes , Dave Tremaine , Tom White and Gary Bagnard . GEORGETOWN was very weak on the boards last year , but expects much improvement from its predominantly sophomore and junior squad . There is reasonable height and good depth and shooting , but Coach Tommy Nolan 's first task is to find a backcourtman who can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-scoring Brian Sheehan , Tom Matan and Tom Coleman , are the nucleus of a first team , and five sophomores are possible starters . They are Paul Tagliabue , Bob Sharpenter , Jim Carrino , Tom O'Dea and Vince Wolfington . LOUISVILLE has 10 men , including three starters , who went to the NCAA semifinals last March , and may well get that far again this time . Coach Peck Hickman can field a front line averaging 6 feet 7 , using veterans Fred Sawyer , John Turner and sophomore Bud Olsen . Other tall front courtmen are George Burnette , Joe Kitchen , Jerry Watkins , John Ray and Larry Knott . Roger Tieman will again start at guard with one of the following : Buddy Leather , Ron Rubenstein , Bryan Hall , Howard Stacey . Much of the time the Louisville offense looks like helter-skelter run-and-shoot , but the shooting is nearly always good , and if it is n't , Fred Sawyer is under the basket to tip the ball in , stuff it , or flip it out to a teammate for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hardly notice the fact that three of the team 's top scorers are gone . The best height and depth of Coach Bob Vanatta 's tenure is available , and he has two standout guards , Gene Wilfong and Skip Wolfe , and George Price , one of his best front courtmen for three years , around whom to build . Frank Snyder , 6 feet 6 , and Wayne Yates , 6 feet 8 , come out of service , Jim Donovan , 6 feet 8 , and speedy Bill Koehler are redshirts , and Lou Jackson and Hunter Beckman are tall , rugged newcomers . In addition , there are last year 's reserves : Oscar Ammer , Phil Kibbey , Lowery Kirk and Fred Mangum . A great improvement in rebounding is obviously in the cards . Coach Bill Gardiner comes to LOYOLA OF NEW ORLEANS after 13 years at Spring Hill and inherits a wealth of veteran talent and two tall sophomores who could help make his debut a happy one . Three seasoned starters are Art Radvilas , Larry Trunk and John Flynn ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is depth at all positions and a number of good shooters among the vets . The list includes Bob Balch , Larry Henneberger , Harriman Morgan , Jack Morris , Len Nalty , John Henneberger , Bob Weber , Darryl Tschirn and Ron Churba . FLORIDA STATE 'S Coach Bud Kennedy must build a new team around one returning starter and two of last year 's reserves . There are five promising sophomores but very little size , and Florida will take a beating on the boards again . In addition , none of the veterans averaged better than eight points a game last season . They are Jim Savage , Fred Woodward and John Richter . The newcomers are David Fedor , Rufus Ashworth , Jack Davis , Ray Swain and Tim Edney . MIAMI led the nation in scoring last year with an 87.6-per-game average , though it is only fair to note that it was achieved with a very spotty schedule and that the opponents averaged 80.8 points themselves . Miami plays many of its games against other members of the Florida Intercollegiate Conference , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " independent " ) because the general level of play of the other schools is not major-college caliber . Coach Bruce Hale has practically all of his key men back and adds two excellent newcomers in Julie Cohen and Dod Hammond . Cohen will join 5-foot-6 Dick Hickox in the backcourt , and Hammond will play opposite Ron Godfrey up front . Despite his size , Hickox averaged 18 points a game last year with a great variety of shots . Center and top rebounder is Harry Manushaw , and there is adequate depth everywhere but at the pivot . OKLAHOMA CITY has two of its three top scorers back but must count on considerable help from rookies to approach its fine record of last season . This is a slim squad and the experienced men lack size . Two of the veterans are Kiowa Indians , Fred Yeahquo and Bud Sahmaunt , the latter an excellent defensive player . A third Kiowa is sophomore Eugene Tsoodle , who may start on the strength of his outside shooting . Other returning veterans are top scorer Fred Moses and Harry Vines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Johnston and Chester Kyle . // FAR WEST : Seattle has lost three starters but can hardly miss high national ranking again . An excellent front line includes Don Ogorek , 6-foot-5 veteran of Seattle 's tournament team two years ago ; Tim Cousins , 6 feet 8 ; and junior college transfer Dave Mills , 6 feet 6 . At the guards are two excellent shooters , sophomore Tommy Shaules and another transfer , Bob Gillum . Elbert Burton , 6 feet 11 , has a lot to learn before he can start but has already made considerable progress . Veteran reserves are Lloyd Murphy and Don Piasecki , and other newcomers are Dan Stautz , Al Birtles and Bill Brupbacher . For its size , the squad is exceptionally fast and rebounds strongly . Having tried unsuccessfully to make a basketball player out of a 7-foot-3 Frenchman ( Jean Lefebvre ) , GONZAGA now continues the experiment with a tall Greek , 7-foot-1 George Troutzos , and a rangy Swede , 6-foot-8 Hans Albertson . Fortunately , however , there is some genuine talent on the squad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year as a sophomore . He 's a mere 6 feet 1 . Other veteran hands are Charles Jordon , Blake Elliott and George Morrison . Rookie Oscar McGuire is a potential starter , and reserves include Jerry Wasson and Mike Kelly . Aside from the overseas entries , the squad lacks height and adequate bench strength , FRESNO STATE has a deep , seasoned squad , plus a number of prospects from its best sophomore bunch in history . Veteran starters are Tom Gilcrest , high-scoring Babe Williams and Al Brown . Rookies Mike McFerson and Verne Grissman may start with them , to make up a first string of good average size but lacking the overpowering big man . Reserves include Bob Clerico , Jan Barrett , Ray McCarty , Floyd Gross , Frank Johnson and Earl Smith . At PORTLAND Coach Al Negratti has all the height he needs but hopes to find two shifty , small guards to go with his tall front line . The big men are Chuck Rogers , 6 feet 7 , Jim Altenhofen , 6 feet 5 , and Bill Garner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is reserve Roland Carpenter , as well as transfer student Art Easterly , both 6 feet 5 . Negratti will choose his backcourt from among rookies Frank Bosone , Gary Gray and senior Frank Rector , who was out last year because of a back injury . A good bench includes Douglas Stewart , Jerry Burke and Ron Schult . MONTANA STATE has a new 12,000-seat field house and a strong squad coming up . It hopes to join a conference in the near future . Coach Keith Lambert has one of the area 's top performers in 6-foot-4 Larry Chanay at forward , and both his regular guards , Jim Owens and Jim Murphy , are back with him . Two rookies who may start are Armando Erias and Tom Sawyer . Three others are Bert Emery , Gordon Haugen ( a 6-foot-8 center ) and Bob Parkins . Last year 's reserves include Andy Matson and Conrad Strzelczyk . This bunch shoots well and has good speed , but may be weak on the boards .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
