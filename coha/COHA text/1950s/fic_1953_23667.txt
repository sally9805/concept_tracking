The Blue ( lharrn A Story by Paul Hyde Bonner W HEN Tim saw Brigadier Charteris coming up the path through the rhododendrons , he stepped quickly back from the bank and entered the small pine wood . Stealthily , like a thief or a deserter , which the good Lord knew he was not , for it was his beat and no man on earth had a better right to be walking its ' banks , he crept up through the trees and shrubs , keeping himself well hidden from the river , until he reached a big stone on a rise of ground where he could sit and not be seen , yet have , through the leaves of a hazel bush , a commanding view of the pool . He laid his gaff carefully down on the turf beside him and watched . The path from the inn , up which the Brigadier was coming for his day 's sport on the Otter Beat , was on the opposite bank from where Timothy Murtha was keeping his hidden vig-il . From the main road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bower of azalea and rhododendron , then suddenly it emerged in the sunlight where the woods and the shrubs receded , displaying the pool in a nice margin of grassy bank , like a cat's-eye set in emeralds . The streak in the eat's-eye was the long wedg-e of white water that bisected the dark still surface of the long pool . It was on the edge of the streak where the salmon lay , gaining strength for the next night 's battle with the rapids ahead . To be sure , there were also fish , and good ones , way down at the apex of the wedge where the swift water subsided into the black stillness of the pool .. But these would have to be reached from Tim Murtha 's side and Tim knew that it was the old soldier 's habit to save them for the late afternoon . Brigadier Charteris stopped when he reached the sunlight to survey his day 's field of operations . He was carrying two rods in his right hand , a twelve-foot fly rod and a much shorter spinning rod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and braided string , to which was attached a brightly polished metal gaff . He wore a worn and much mended tweed jacket of a greenish brown color and an ancient stalker 's hat of the same stuff , which was hung like a Christmas tree with old and dilapidated salmon and searrout Ilies , His black rubber hip-boots seemed unnaturally long and narrow , making him look like an ungainl y crane , ( or he was a tall , spare man with a thin , weatherbeaten face and a cavalryman 's temper . ' Tire only thing new on him in ten years is the gaff , Tim thought , and spat silently into the hazel bush . Charteris watched the water for a sign , his eyes concentrated intently on the sides of the wedge of white water . There was a splash as a fish showed in the center of the pool , just beyond the apex of the current . The Brigadier turned his head quickly , but not quickly enough to see it . Tim had , though . He had seen a monster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charteris hesitated , then walked on to the head of the pool . He was about to lay his rods carefully down beside the little stone luncheon but which stood near the rocks at the head of the pool when the monster leaped again . This time coming down on the water on his side with a smack that sounded like a cannon shot . Again Charteris , who had had . his back to the tail of the pool . had not turned in time to see the fish . But it was clear from his actions . as Tim observed him , that the noise had unnerved him . He was suddenly undecided . He could not make up his mind whether the provocation was worth changing a tactic that had remained rigid for ten seasons . Should he succumb to the temptation to fish the slow water before he had thoroughly covered the sides of the swift wedge ? A stubborn donkey of a man he is , Tim said to himself as he saw the hesitation in the Brigadier 's posture . If it was me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I was to say to him , General , if I , was you , I 'd have a go at that one . He 's a bender , he is . A bit red maybe , but a powerful big salmon . What would he do ? He 'd wither me with them beady eyes of his , and Tim , he 'd say , you should know better than to tell a man to be wasting his time on a spring fish that has been in the river since March and would be paying no more attention to a fly or a prawn than you would to a glass of buttermilk . We 'll be fishing the fast water as we always do , he 'd say , as stubborn as a Belfast solicitor . Charteris made up his mind . As long as he was alone , with no gillie to witness the breakdown of his habit , he would go after that salmon . After all , he consoled himself . it was the only one who had yet showed , and it was patently wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on speculation . Not that he approved of this changing of his calculated , proven tactic . He was , as a matter of fact , chagrined at his lack of stanchness , at his weakness in falling for the blandishments of a playful little summer salmon who could be as easily snared in the afternoon . He picked up his fly rod , reached for his fly box in the poacher 's sack , and carefully selected a low-water Blue Charm , his favorite fly for July on the Derryelare . As he snipped off the tired Silver Doctor , which he had used the previous evening for seatrout on the Ballymaam Beat and bent the new fly on his leader , he noted that the elouds were forming around the Twelve Pins which towered to the North of him , those peaks of the highlands which guard the haunted streams and laughs of Connemara . A good omen , he thought . A bit of shade over the water will help to hide the trailing gut . Before starting on his trek to the far bank he checked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knife , scales , all safely stowed in the sack , gaff hanging ready , line greased atthe hotel before he started , everything , in fact , primed for the battle . Leaving the spinning rod by the hut , he walked slowly up the path to the stone bridge which crossed the river at the rapids . He did not approve of impatience . , Tim , watching from his aerie , could scarcely believe his eyes . The Brigadier was actually going to change his iron routine and start fishing the slack water . It was unprecedented , a display of folly , yet Tim knew why the sound of that fish smacking the water had caused it . There was a reason , a memory . THE Derryelare Hotel for fishermen , A each beat was assigned its own gillie , and each rod was made to rotate daily , beginning at the butt on Balinafad Lough and proceeding downstream until , on the ninth day , he was fishing the Roundstone Beat at the mouth of the river . The Otter Beat had been Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from March to September , from big spring salmon to fat autumn seatrout , he had gaffed and netted all sorts of fish for all manner of fishermen . He knew his stretch of water as well as any fish that ever rested in it , every rock , every eddy of the current , and every spot preferred by salmon and by seatrout . A lifetime of observation had taught him the size and color of lure that fish fancied under each condition of sky , wind , temperature , and height of water , for he had been a mighty poacher of these waters before the hotel had bought the property from the estate of a noble lord and had judiciously put him on the payroll as a gillie . If you met his standards of character and skill , he would , when asked , impart his knowledge and suggest the fly to be used . But if you were a braggart or a'dunce or a novice without humility , he would let you flounder in your own way . Only a miserable few of the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Tim respected . The majority , the great majority , were heavy-handed duffers who had no inkling of how a fish liked to have a fly presented . Brigadier Charteris was unquestionably the best of the few real fishermen . Being highly skilled and with a delicate and intuitive wrist , he invariably killed fish when others failed and had retained his position as top rod on the river for ten seasons . Like all champions , he was as proud of his record as he was contemptuous of tyros . His annual visit to the Derryc I are was always of three weeks ' duration-the last week in June and the first fortnight of July-which meant that , as a rule , his rotation brought him three times each season to the care of Tim Murtha , on the Otter Beat . For nine years Tim and the Brigadier had welded their forces in a perfect harmony of respect and admiration , in spite of the latter 's irascible , dour , and dogmatic ways . Charteris had stated flatly , over his whisky in the billiard room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Tim , who avoided direct statements as he would the ghost of the Clancy , inferred to his fellow gillies that the Brigadier was almost as pretty a fisherman as he was himself , which was the highest praise he had ever given any man with a rod in his hand . T Hus it had been on a bright July afternoon ' of the year before when the Brigadier , with Tim watching ' carefully from beyond a jut of rock on the downstream side where he would not interfere with the back cast , had started to fish the tail of the current on the Otter pool with a low-water Blue Charm . On the third cast Tim had seen the greased line swing around toward the bank , then suddenly sink as something drew it taut . The Brigadier had seen it too , and being a calm and practiced fisherman had let whatever it was that had taken the fly swim down to the stream-bed with it . After a suitable interval the Brigadier had whipped his rod tip smartly . Then all hell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water had erupted like Vesuvius as a great salmon , a monster of a spring fish , had leaped a good four feet into the air , shining and glistening in the sunlight , his great rose-colored belly curving as he headed back into the river intent on freeing himself . But as suddenly as he had leaped the Brigadier had lowered his rod , for he was one of those sensitive fishermen who could feel a fish gather for a leap . The fight had been one of heroic scale . On his first dash upstream the salmon had made two mighty leaps in the fast water , then had turned and run furiously downstream , taking out line until the black silk backing started running through the guides . At this the Brigadier had raced down the bank , scampering over the rocky promontory like a mountain goat , leaping down in front of Tim , and floundering on through the reeds when he had been forced into the water by the azaleas which lined the hanks below the pool . Out into the stream he had splashed until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still the reel had sung as the fish continued downstream . Not once dur ing all his dashing and scrambling had the Brigadier allowed his rod to waver from the perpendicular , that is , the butt of the rod , for the rod as a whole was bent into a letter C. " By God , Tim , I do n't believe he 's going to stop ! " the soldier had shouted when he had reached the limit of his depth . " Try givin ' him slack , " Tim had called . " I might lose him . " " Either way you might , sir , " Tim had yelled to make himself heard above the roar of the rapids . Without answering the Brigadier had quickly dropped the tip of his rod and the line went slack at once . Feeling no pull the salmon had stopped . Then , from the action of the line he could tell that the fish had turned and was swimming slowly upstream to his accustomed lair . The Brigadier had reeled in carefully , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hook . When the salmon had reached the tail of the pool , Charteris had retreated step by step , back to the bank , over the rocks , until he was standing on the spot where he had hooked him . Then gradually he had tightened the line until he could feel the fish solidly entrenched on the bottom . He had given the rod a few gentle jerks , but the salmon had not budged . Then he had ordered Tim to drop a few rocks on the spot where the line indicated that the salmon was sulking . Tim had picked up a stone the size of a brick and lobbed it into the pool . It must have annoyed the fish for he had moved upstream , not in a rush , but deliberately , until he was under the white water . Then the Brigadier , exerting rod pressure with great skill and delicacy , had turned him , making him swim downstream and toward the near bank . He had seemed docile now , beat.en . His great body had come up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tail . He had passed the Brigadier and was headed for the point of the rocky peninsula . Tim had not moved , seeing that the fish was far from spent . " Get out there and gaff him as he passes the rocks , " the Brigadier had shouted . " ' T is not ready he is for the gaff , " Tim had cautioned . " Hurry , you idiot ! Gaff him now , " the Brigadier had cried angrily , leaning on the rod in order to hold the fish in ncar to the point of the rocks . It was a command . Reluctantly , feeling it to be a crucial error in judgment , Tim had climbed out on the rocks and ; crouching , had lowered the gaff into the water behind the salmon 's tail . Slowly he had moved the gaff forward while the fish , his jaw damped on the taut gut , fanned the water and watched him . When the iron was under the salmon 's midriff , Tim had come up quickly , but the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like lightning , leaping at the end of the turn . The point of the gaff had merely torn a cut in its side , and the Brigadier , not expecting the leap for which there had been no warning , had failed to lower his rod so that the gut had parted at the fish 's mouth . Tim had turned where he was crouching on the rocks and had said , " A pity , sir . He 'd go fifty pounds , that fish . Just as I told you , he was n't ready for the gaff . " The Brigadier 's face had been crimson with rage . The rod was shaking in his hand as if he had in mind beating Tim over the head with it . " You clumsy brute ! " he had shouted . " You missed him . Any child could have gaffed him . I brought him to you on a platter and you jolly well made a hash of it . Next time I fish this beat I 'll do my own gaffing . " He had reeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalking back to the bridge he had said , " You ought to be sacked for this , Tim Murtha . You 've lost me the best fish ever seen in this river . " Oh , there had been a great to-do about it at the hotel , which had lasted until Brigadier Charteris had left for Dublin and the Holyhead ferry . Charteris had stormed at the management and the guests , saying that Tim was a butcher who had no right to be a gillie at all , let alone gillie at the Otter Beat . Of . course the management and the gillies and the waiters and the chambermaids had accepted Tim 's side of the story . They knew how manysalmon Tim had gaffed legitimately and illegitimately and did not question his statement that the Brigadier had not taken his advice , the advice of the greatest expert in County Galway . Besides , the old soldier was an Englishman , and a crusty one at that , who never tipped more than ten shillings . x L this Tim remembered as he watched the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalk down the path that led to the spot on the grassy bank where the disaster had occurred . Although the manager had told him that he would not be needed when the Brigadier fished the Otter Beat this season , nevertheless Tim had decided that it would be more hill watching the old man fish than drinking Cuinness at the Roundstone pub . When the Brigadier came to that point on the path nearest to the hazel bush , Tim looked carefully to see what fly he had chosen . Even at ten yards he could make out that it was a Blue Charm , and he knew from the height of the water and the shine of the sun on the dark surface of the pool that it was the one lure which might tempt a salmon on this morning . Not that he thought for a moment that the old fish who had showed would be interested . Spring fish do n't take in July . That old bruiser of a year back had been a freak exception , something which does not happen twice , certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be calling on all the Saints in Heaven to give that fish a mind to nibble at a wee bit of a Blue Charm with no dressing on him at all . From what I 've seen of him he 's as big as the other one , he is , if not a pound or two bigger . Having reached his position , Charteris the poacher 's sack from his shoulder , hooked the gaff and hung it on his belt , deliberately placed the sack well back the bushes , where , if anything should occur , he would not tread on it . The pool was placid now , giving no hint that any salmon were watching from its dark depths . Charter is took his stance and stripped some line from his reel , shaking the fly - in the sunlight . His first cast was short and tentative , covering only the water near the bank . It was meant to drown the fly , not to excite any appetite . He stripped more line and made a second cast straight out into the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc as the current carried the fly down toward the jutting point of rock below him . Two more shan strips of line and he cast again . This time the line was well out to the apex of the swift water . Again he watched ( and Tim also ) as the floating line curved gracefully , his eye focused on the knot at the end where the leader was tied . He noticed that the knot was cutting the water at a speed which the current did not justify . Then it disappeared below the surface and the line became taut with a steady downward pull . It was a sign which Charteris recognized ( rom long experience . He observed it calmly , that is , outwardly calmly , with the inner excitement controlled by reason . A fish had the fly in its mouth and was sinking to the stream-bed . Momentarily , at least , he had forgotten his experience of the year before . It never occurred to him that the taker was anything but a small summer salmon , or maybe a grilse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anticipation , praying wildly for a repetition , knowing that where the fly was taken was where the monster had twice shown . When he thought the fish had had sufficient time to get the fly well in his mouth , Charteris came up firmly with the rod tip in order to set the hook . The waters of the pool were raked as if by a torpedo . A great , boiling wake streaked to the opposite shore where the salmon broke the surface in a tremendous leap , straight up , nose to the sky , then giving his b09Y a twist as every muscle was directed to shaking the fly from his lip . But the line had slackened even before the fish had reached the summit of his leap , for the Brigadier , on the instant of the first rush , had anticipated the jump and was prepared to meet it . What he had not bargained for was the size and strength of this great salmon . Like last year 's , he thought , as big , if not bigger . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a responsive spring of steel . This time he would have to do it alone , even if it took all day . He 'd show them it could be done . No man is given two chances like this in a lifetime . It was a test , a measure of his skill . After the third leap the salmon rushed downstream and the reel screeched as his line flashed through the guides . The black back-ing came into sight as the fish dashed past the reed bed and Charteris was prepared to repeat his scramble of the year before . However , he had already made up his mind to try the slack line tactic before the salmon forced him to wade into the stream . It had worked once . It might work again . At all events , if the hook was firm , nothing would be lost . It did work . The salmon checked his rush and turned , swimming slowly back to the center of the pool . I TAUGHT him that one , Tim said to him-self . He had risen from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as that salmon was on the line there was no chance of the Brigadier taking- his eyes from the river . As the soldier 's nerves had controlled his muscles , the gillie 's had left his uncontrolled . He was shaking all over with excitement , whispering to himself in gasps , Holy Mother of God ! The Saints be praised ! ' T is the biggest bloody fish that ever a man has seen ! The father of all salmon it is ! As the fish neared the tail of the current , the Brigadier put the pressure on again , not wanting him to sink and sulk as the other one had . This brought on another rush , with another leap at . the end of it , this time straight up into the rapids where the rocks were thick and jagged . The next rush was a return toward the bank at Charter-is ' feet . He reeled in furiously , but the ' fish was faster , swirling to the surface , seeing his antazorrist and dashing off again , far over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , he 'll soon tire himself . A pink fish has no strength for a long battle . And if that lanky fighting cock of an Englishman has an ounce of brain in his head , which I doubt , he 'll bide his time until he can coax him into the shallow reeds below the point of rock . But if he tries it before the salmon is all . his side , showing the pink belly of him , he 'll lose him as sure as he lost the last one . Tim , of course , was prejudiced . A year ago he would have counted on the Brigadier to plan the kill correctly in view of the circumstances . But ever since that wrong command he was convinced that the soldier 's head was as hard as his heart . He could not know watching the battle , that Charteris already made the identical decision . The salmon was tugging now in short , pug-nacious lunges , trying to work his way toward some sunken piles which had once supported a pier on the opposite bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Br-igadier backed up the bank , ' - iving every ounce that the gut would stand in an effort to pull the fish 's head hack toward the current . The pressure succeeded , for the salmon dashed upstream again , leaping out of the foam and whirling about in a frenzy . On the next leap , which was directly below him , Tim saw something that made his heart skip " a beat . As clear as could be he had seen the hook holding a small strip of torn skin on the salmon 's lower jaw . Save my soul , he said to himself , if he takes another leap , he 's gone ! He saw the Brigadier reeling hard , his rod held high , the tip bending to the weight of the salmon , and he wanted to cry out , " Ease him , sir . He 's about to pull loose ! " but he dared not . If he did call , and the fish broke , he would be blamed again . Charteris had not seen the precarious hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to have the eye of an eagle to note so small a thing in an instant . Besides , he was far too concentrated on the rod and the line and the general behavior of his adversary . He had observed , however , that after that last leap the salmon had seemed suddenly tired . He swam lazily now , rolling from side to side , closer to the surface than he had been . Charteris let him swim , holding him with only enough tension to feel himself in control . The fish passed the end of the current , his tail out of water , fanning slowly . A slight pressure of the rod made him head toward the bank . Tim figured correctly that if this situation maintained for another few minutes , the salmon would swing past the rocks and close to shore . He could see that the salmon was close to exhaustion and that the Brigadier was letting him have his way . It was then that Tim made up his mind . Grabbing his gaff , he ran through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling on his stomach , he wriggled through the bushes and slid down the bank behind the rocks so that the Brigadier could not see him . When he reached the water , he slipped in like an otter and pulled himself along on the edge of the rocks . At the tip of the point he waitedbehind the biggest rock , watching for the salmon to come into view , with only his head and shoulders showing above the water . Charteris was wondering if the fish was through , ready for the beach . He was in no hurry . After that first rush he had made up his mind to wait until he could see the salmon 's belly before making any move to bring him to the reeds . He did not care if it took all day . This fish was worth lunch , tea , and dinner . But the beast was plainly tired , rolling as he was from side to side , letting the current ease him along . He watched the great tail , fanning its slow , pitiful way off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on a bit . No trouble there . The tail disappeared behind the rock . There was the noise of a tremendous commotion in the water beyond the point . Instinctively Charter is jerked pressure on the line . As he did so the weight evaporated and his fly went sailing through the air . " Damn ! Blasti Bloody ! Bitch ! " he roared . " He 's off ! " Through the smoke and din of his own anguish he became faintly conscious of the fact that the commotion beyond the point had not ceased . Dropping his rod , he jumped forward onto the rocks and looked down . There below him was Tim Murtha half submerged , his arms and chest pinning the huge salmon to the bank , one hand gripping the handle of the gaff ' so hard that his knuckles were white . I - rrook the two of them to carry the fish to the hotel and place it on the scales in the billiard room . Before Tim could lift a weight ' the entire staff , including ' the cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , and saying , " Glory be ! " Charteris just stood there , looking ' stranjrelv wan and corrtr ite . He said nothing . In fact he had said very little since he had found Tim hugging the fish in the river , only a weak , " Miracle ! " when he had seen ' the torn thread of skin which had held the hook . His eyes were on the salmon which was so large that he could hardly be kept steady in the pan of the scales . He seemed frozen , like a man in shock . He did not see Tim putting every counterweight in the house on the scales with trembling fingers , the stone Hoor beneath him holding a pool of water from his dripping clothes . Nat all the counterweights would budge the bar , so Tim had to ask the manager for a loan of some sovereigns . There was a breathless silence when the bar finally lifted a fraction of an inch . " Fifty-seven pounds , nine ounces ! " Tim intoned , " And the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand to the Brigadier . Charteris , still in a daze , shook the hand perfunctorily . " Barman , " he said in a low voice , " bring me a bottle of your best Dublin whisky . " No one spoke while the barman went for the whisky , though the manager was tempted to ask how it happened that Tim had been on the Otter Beat , but a look at the Brigadier 's white face made him think that perhaps it was not the right moment . The barman returned with a bottle and handed it to the Brigadier . They all watched him take it and put it under his arm while he reached for his wallet and extracted a five-pound note . Putting the bottle and the note together in his right hand , Charteris cleared his throat and spoke . " That fish , " he said , " was held by a thread of skin on his lip . If it had not been for the magnificent gaff work of Tim Murtha , he would never have graced those scales . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim . " I salute the best gillie on this or any other river . " With his back as straight as a ramrod the Brigadier executed an about-face and marched ' out of the room . The color had returned to his face and the trace of a smile wrinkled his eyes as he heard the applause behind him .
