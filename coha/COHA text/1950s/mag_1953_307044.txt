In most respects , the President 's plan for reorganization of the U.S. defense establishment followed the recommendations of Nelson Rockefeller 's three-month-old Committee on Department of Defense Organization. * But it also reflected a sureness of touch based on the President 's intimate knowledge of the nation 's military machine and its shortcomings . " I address the Congress , " noted Eisenhower last week , " on a subject which has been of primary interest to me throughout all the years of my adult life . . . " <P> The new plan had three major objectives : more efficiency , improved strategic planning and greater civilian control . To achieve those objectives , said Ike , the following changes are necessary : <P> Transfer of management of the Joint Staff , an important working-level panel of about 200 top officers , from the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a body to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs alone . End result : substantial increase in the authority of the chairman , at the expense of the other members of the J.C.S. ( a move certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward unification ) . <P> Abolition of three " slow and clumsy tools " - the Munitions Board , the Research &; Development Board and the Defense Supply Management Agency . To take over their functions as well as those of other boards , committees and advisers , the President recommended the creation of six new Assistant Secretaries of Defense . Result : strengthened control for the Secretary of Defense-and. incidentally , elimination of about 500 Defense Department employees . <P> Transfer of executive responsibility for a unified , multiservice command from one of the Joint Chiefs ( e.g. , Korea under Army General J. Lawton Collins . Alaska under Air Force General Hoyt Vandenberg ) to a civilian service secretary . Result : more civilian control , and a further confinement of the Joint Chiefs to their role of " military advisers . " <P> Affirmation of the authority of the Secretary of Defense to delegate his functions as he sees fit , to insure flexible administration , capable of decentralization . <P> Both in &; out of the Pentagon , Washington has been talking of the need for revision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patched by Congress nearly four years ago . But even the most ardent advocates of revision hesitated to throw debate open for the pulling and hauling of the individual services and their congressional spokesmen . Eisenhower 's decision to present his proposals in the form of a " reorganization plan " was perhaps his happiest stroke , since a reorganization plan 1 ) can not be amended by Congress , 2 ) is not likely to involve committee hearings , and 3 ) automatically becomes law unless the House or Senate rejects it within 60 days . <P> <P> - The members : General Omar Bradley , Scientist Vannevar Bush , President Milton S. Eisenhower of Penn State College , Office of Defense Mobilization Chief Arthur Flemming , former Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett , RCA Board Chairman David Sarnoff.
