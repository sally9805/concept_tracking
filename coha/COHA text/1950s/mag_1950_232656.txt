In the year and a half that Edward G. Miller Jr . has been U.S. Assistant Secretary of State , he has scored many a point with sympathetic words and by deft handling of sensitive Latin Americans . Last week Miller peeled off his velvet gloves in a blunt address to U.S. coffeemen and Brazilian guests at the National Coffee Association 's convention in Boca Raton , Fla . Miller 's message : the U.S. expects Latin America to share in the world struggle against Communist imperialism by adjusting its economy to the realities of the U.S. war-production program . The Latin countries ' first tasks , he said , would be to tighten their belts , prepare for rationing of U.S. exports , increase their own production of strategic materials for sale at controlled prices , and brace themselves for the hardships of economic mobilization . <P> Miller had little to say about the ticklish subject of coffee production and prices ; the inference was that the State Department no longer considered the controversial Gillette report on coffee-market manipulations ( TIME , June 19 ) a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said he : " It may perhaps be charged that the " remarks I ... make are not wholly in accord with the traditional concepts of diplomatic conduct . . . The peoples of Latin America must realize and appreciate the magnitude of our effort and sacrifice in treasure and blood in the far-flung fields of the East-West conflict . . . While we are making these sacrifices to defend our national integrity , we are contributing very particularly to the security of the entire hemisphere . " <P> Miller mentioned recent spectacular dollar earnings by Latin American countries selling strategic goods to the U.S. , and warned that this flow of dollars , continued in the future , would bring a new danger of inflation , since the U.S. on a war-production footing must cut down or eliminate many exports . Nevertheless , Miller said , the U.S. can guarantee that Latin America will get its share of scarce U.S. goods in return for full cooperation . " But we must face up to the fact , " he said , " that shortages and controls are inevitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
