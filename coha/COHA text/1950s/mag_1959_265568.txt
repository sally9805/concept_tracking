Meeting the press in Washington after her return from space , Monkey Able seemed chipper , jumping around and throwing things almost as if she were fresh from a peaceful monkey house . But after her moment of glory , she was flown off to Fort Knox , Ky. , where Army Dr. Thomas Davis noticed that one of the electrodes inserted under her skin , a - inch- square bit of silver-plated wire mesh , had started a slight infection . It was decided to operate , using a general anesthetic , trichloroethylene . <P> On the operating table , Able 's heart began to fibrillate . For 2 hours Dr. Davis and others worked over the sinking monkey . Dr. Davis tried to revive her by blowing his own breath into her lungs . Other doctors cut into her chest , gave her heart electric shocks and massaged it by hand . But Able was dead . Next morning her carcass was flown in a small suitcase to Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington , where an autopsy was performed by Colonel Joe M. Blumberg , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tragedy and Snafu . Able will now be stuffed . At the suggestion of Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas , she will be exhibited at Independence , her officially claimed birthplace , then moved to a permanent showplace in Washington 's Smithsonian Institution . <P> Unhappily , this tragedy was not the only snafu involving Able . Two explanations had been officially offered for the failure of the attempt to test Able 's reactions in flight by having her press a button when a red light flashed . First explanation was that the reaction instrument failed to work . Then it was explained that last-minute tests of the button circuit showed that it was setting up interference in other circuits and it had therefore been turned off . Last week word leaked out that neither explanation was correct . Truth was that Able was a substitute off the space-monkey bench . <P> Question of Birth . For months , the Army had painstakingly trained ten rhesus monkeys in button pushing . Early in May , the State Department learned that all ten were born . in India . State was shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred in Mother India ? <P> A frantic search began for native-born monkeys . Nobody had kept close tabs on individual birthplaces . At last , Army agents found in Madison , Wis. four rhesus monkeys guaranteed ( well , almost guaranteed ) to have been born in the Independence ( Kans. ) zoo . While being flown to Fort Knox , they escaped in a way-station airport and were at large for some time . When they finally arrived at Cape Canaveral on May 14 , they were put into intensive training courses . But the two weeks before blastoff were not enough . Result : the button-pressing experiment had to be abandoned simply because Able did not have the hang of it . <P> The case of 11 oz . Monkey Baker was simpler and happier . She hailed from the jungle near Iquitos , Peru . Her electrodes were successfully removed under local anesthesia by a Navy doctor . The Navy hopes to breed her in a year or so , and examine her offspring for genetic effects of space .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
