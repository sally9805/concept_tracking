The Answers : // PEE WEE REESE SHORTSTOP DODGERS // " It 's been that way since baseball started . I do n't like it . But it 's going to be that way as long as baseball is played . I suppose the duster is okay if the pitcher can control it . But can he ? Even so , a pitcher does n't have a lot of guts if he throws at a man 's head . " // EDDIE LOPAT PITCHER YANKEES // " No . But the two hardest balls to hit are the high , inside pitch and the low , outside ball . When a batter has a weakness for the high , inside pitch , I throw it . But there 's no guarantee that I can control it fully . A duster is different . It 's thrown to hit or knock a batter down . " // DUKE SNIDER OUTFIELDER DODGERS // " To brush a player off is part of the game . But some pitchers throw at your head and leave it to you to duck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off balance . He may hit a man once in a while , but he 's on the spot , too . Pitching is his bread and butter . " // BOB FELLER PITCHER INDIANS // " No . I have no such pitch in my repertoire . Walter ' Big Train ' Johnson of the Senators had so much speed that he 'd deliberately throw wide . He often said that one of his fast balls might kill a man if it hit his head . I used to throw much harder when I first came up . But never at a man 's head . " // MICKEY MANTLE OUTFIELDER YANKEES // " It 's a legitimate pitch , as long as it 's a duster and not a bean ball . A pitcher has no right to throw at a batter 's head . That 's the bean ball . It can kill a man . But when a dangerous batter is dug in too deep or is guarding the plate , a good pitcher will dust him off . " // PHIL RIZZUTO SHORTSTOP YANKEES // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders down , to drive me back . But a high pitch at my head may cost me my bread and butter . Yes , even my life . Only the helmet saved Adcock 's life . There are some pitchers who deliberately throw at your head if you 've gotten two or three hits . " // CARL ERSKINE PITCHER DODGERS // " A deliberate pitch to I hit a man has no place in baseball . But the duster is a pitch a pitcher must have . He uses it to set up a batter for the next pitch . That may strike him out . Sometimes the pitch to drive a batter back is the only defense a pitcher has . " // LARRY DOBY OUTFIELDER INDIANS // " An inside pitch is okay , but I do n't like to see it coming at my head . Baseball should always be a game of skill . The duel between the pitcher and batter is the most interesting part of baseball . But the batter should never serve as a target for the pitcher . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts not to throw the duster . If I 'm throwing low and away , they 're going to lean over the plate to hit . Pafko did that once and took a game away from me . A fast ball , high and inside , might have saved that game . Pafko does n't lean over the plate any more against me. " // ALVIN DARK SHORTSTOP GIANTS // " Certainly . He 'd be crazy not to throw an occasional duster . It 's a valuable pitch because it makes some batters overcautious . If a pitcher can get an out by brushing a back , I do n't blame him . That 's baseball . I do n't I think there are many pitchers who will deliberately bean a batter . "
