Standing on a Chicago el platform one day in 1928 , a lean , mild-mannered New Englander named Nathaniel Leverone idly started feeding coins into the vending machines and got madder by the minute . " I weighed myself on a penny machine and found I weighed 205 , " recalls Leverone . " Another machine said 98 . A chocolate machine gave me nothing , not even my penny back . Out of a peanut machine I got six moldy objects I would n't feed to a goat . " Businessman Leverone got sore enough to go to work to teach the vending-machine business a lesson in honesty-and see if it would not also prove profitable . With $60,000 he founded Chicago 's Automatic Canteen Co . Last week Automatic Canteen , unchallenged leader of a booming $1.7 billion industry , counted record sales of more than $51 million in the first six months of its fiscal year , with profits topping $1.1 million . <P> Slugs , Slugs , Slugs . At first Leverone felt like a pullet plunging into a weasel den . A Dartmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful real-estate operator who was also secretary of Chicago 's Crime Commission , he found a business controlled by sharpers and racketeers ; chewing-gum sticks were cut in half , sold for a penny apiece ; undersized chocolate bars cost a nickel ; peanuts costing 8 per Ib. dribbled out at the rate of six per penny . And when the machines ran out of merchandise , they returned nothing but a hollow , insulting clank . Leverone hired an engineer to design an honest machine that would return coins when empty , then contracted with well-known candy-bar manufacturers to supply full-sized bars for a nickel , used neatly uniformed , bond ed employees to service the machines honestly . <P> But Leverone soon found that if vend ing-machine operators had been crooked , the customers were worse . In its first year Leverone 's company took in $30,000 worth of slugs . Undaunted , Leverone and his engineers installed magnets to winnow out iron slugs , developed a three-fingered scanning device to reject slugs with holes in them . To reject more sophisticated slugs , he inserted a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins that were either too hard or too soft bounced off the anvil into slots leading to the coin-return chute . When cheaters dis covered slugs with just the right bouncing qualities , Leverone 's engineers countered with electrical devices to test conductiv ity , gauges to measure dimensions , gadg ets to bite for traces of lead or tin . But for years , as fast as Leverone improved his machines , ingenious customers found ways to cheat them , including " " tapping " , " i.e. , tilting the machine and whacking it . <P> Says Leverone wryly : " Funny thing about coin machines . When somebody hits on a way to beat them , the news travels coast to coast in a flash . "
