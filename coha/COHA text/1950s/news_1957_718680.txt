txt The Egyptian Government-sponsored Middle East News Agency has reported that the current talks between United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold and President iNasser nave resuitea in 7a concurrence of viewpoints and an understanding on the possibility of reaching a solution to the question of navigation through the Suez Canal . " The agency has also reported that the Egyptian Government will , within five days , issue a detailed explanatory note supplementing the memorandum on the Suez Canal which was handed to diplomatic missions in Cairo last week . Mr. Hammarskjold ' and his staff remain as sphinxlike as ever in their discretion . UN sources refused to confirm or deny the Middle East News Agency 's report . They advised , however , that it be treated with caution . ? It is worth while to recall how Mr. Hammarskjold conceives of his job in trying to edge the parties toward agreement in the Suez Canal dispute ? in this case the parties are Egypt , of course , and the main users of the canal , with Britain and France at their head . UN Role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Hammarskjold said , " Again , what I do is not to put out any proposals on my own , nor try to formulate proposals made by y , ou or any of the others . . . . I just wish in my bwn words to try and spell out what arc my conclusions from the entirely noncommittal observations made in the course of the private talks , interpolating on some points in the light of my interpretation of the sense of the talks where they did not fully cover the ground . " In the light of these remarks , it is most unlikely that Mr. Hammarskjold came to Cairo with any proposals of his own on which he could negotiate agreement with President Nasser . The most that the Middle East News Agency 's report could mean , then , is that Mr. Hammarskjold has indicated concurrence that Colonel Nasser 's interpretation of points set out in last week 's Egyptian memorandum is not at variance with the six principles which the Security Council agreed should be met in any settlement of the Suez question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the demand that Suez Canal tolls be paid in advance to the Suez Canal Authority in Egypt or to its nominees . Britain , France , the United States , and Norway had earlier proposed that as an interim arrangement 50 per cent of the tolls should be paid to the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority and the other 50 per cent into a fund to be held by the World Bank . This proposal was apparently leaked to the press in London , and was rejected outright by the Egyptians without any more ado . The considered British view on the Egyptian declaration that tolls must be paid in advance to the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority has not been publicly disclosed . It is assumed here , however , that communications are continuing to pass between Mr. Hammarskjold and the British and their associates  --  particularly as the reopening of the canal to ships of maximum tonnage draws rapidly nearer . Clearance Nears Mr. Hammarskjold himself left Cairo for a few hours March 25 to fly down to Ismailia to watch the lifting of one of the two remaining major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the powerful tug Edgar Bonnet , which has been lying squarely across the canal just north of Ismailia . Lt. Gen. Raymond A. Wheeler 's salvage team have been working on it for the past two weeks , and now it is ready to be lifted from the bottom and carried to the Suez Canal Authority 's workshops for repair and refitting . The only other remaining obstacle is the wreck of the Egyptian Navy frigate Abukir , which partly blocks the canal near its southern entrance at Suez . General Wheeler 's men now are working on this , and the general has said he expects the whole clearance operation to be completed by April 12 . Once the wreck of the Edgar Bonnet is out of the way , ships of up to 10,000 tons should be able to transit the canal . Already the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority is allowing vessels ' of up to 2,500 tons to sail through the canal . All ships transiting the canal are paying their dues to the Suez Canal Authority . No British or French vessels have yet presented themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cairo later in the day for an evening meeting with Colonel.Nasser  --  the third meeting between the two since Mr. Hammarskjold arrived here March 21 . Between these meetings , Mr. Hammarskjold has been having long conferences with Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi . There is still no indication as to when Mr. Hammarskjold Will be leaving Cairo  --  whether to return to UN headquarters in New York or to visit Israel for talks with government leaders there . The General Assembly resolution of Feb. 2 , which gives Mr. Hammarskjold a mandate for his current talks , asks him to pursue consultations with the parties concerned ? so it is not only with Egypt that the discussions are called for . There are some observers here who believe that the need for talks with the Israeli leaders is more urgent than with the Egyptian leaders . It is the Israelis , not the Egyptians who have so far refused to indicate willingness to let the UN Emergency Force patrol their side of the demarcation line . Though it is no secret that the Egyptians , after their military setback at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UNEF there , at least for a while .
