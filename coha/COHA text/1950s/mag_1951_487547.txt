HAROLD E. STASSEN , WHO ONCE PLAYED THE loading role in . Minnesota Republican politics , has been reduced to the ignominy of hit parts . Senator Robert Taft 's announcement that he intends to campaign for Republican delegates in Minnesota probably means the end of Stassen 's influence in the state . The fact that Taft 's name will not necessarily appear on the primary ballot does not have any real bearing on the amount of support he may receive . The present Minnesota primary , ' which was enacted in 1949 as a means of aiding Stassen , selects only seven of the state 's twenty-eight delegates . That Roy Dunn , Minnesota 's " Mr. Republican , " has decided to take charge of the Taft campaign indicates how feebly the Stassen candle burns in Minnesota at the moment . Actually , President Truman cleverly tipped the scales in Minnesota for Taft last summer when he named Republican Governor , Luther Youngdahl to a federal judgeship . With Governor Youngdahl 's departure from the partisan arena , the way was cleared for Roy Dunn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be interesting to see how Stassen fares with Minnesota voters if he decides to enter the March primary after his return from a visit to General Eisenhower 's headquarters in Europe . THE OPERATION OF MR . TRUMAN 'S EMPLOYEE " loyalty " procedures never appeared more tyrannical than in the dismissal of John Stewart Service , veteran State Department career official . The Loyalty Review Board , headed by former Senator Hiram Bingham of Connecticut , admitted there was no affirmative reason for considering Service disloyal . It held , however , that there was " reasonable ground " to doubt his loyalty because in 1945 Service had given copies of some of his reports from China to Philip Jaffe , coeditor of the magazine Ameretria . In 1945 there was no reason for Service to suspect  --  nor has it ever been shown  --  that Jaffe transmitted information to the Soviet Union . Service , like any other State Department official , had a clear right to declassify information on which he himself had placed a classification rating . Like other State Department officials , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts to accredited editors and reporters . In public speeches and in conversations he had given other newspapermen substantially the same information he gave Jaffe  --  and the loyalty review board had no criticism of this . Unfortunately Mr. Truman last July 21 changed the standards of the loyalty program to allow discharge of an employee not because of " reasonable grounds " for believing him " disloyal " but merely because of " reasonable doubt " of his " loyalty . " The burden of proof was thus shifted entirely to he accused . And in the Service case the board applied the standard rigidly . Under such circumstances the Loyalty Review Board becomes little more than a kangaroo court in which no person under heavy politi- ? cal fire has a chance to win vindication . We hope that Mr. Service carries out his announced plan to appeal the decision to the courts and that the ultimate result will be a judgment denouncing and outlawing the employee-loyalty program as lacking all the elements of fairness and due process . x FOR ONCE THE NATION FINDS ITSELF IN agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Guy Gillette , McCarthy has demanded certain information of the Senate Elections Committee now investigating the charges on the basis of which Senator Benton has demanded his ouster from the Senate . For example , he wants to know the number of persons employed by the committee , their backgrounds and salaries , how many are working on his case , and whether they have been instructed to limit their inquiries to matters involving elections . Senator McCarthy , we believe , is entitled to this information . Of recent years Congressional committees have been known to employ consultants and investigators of dubious antecedents . Any person or organization being investigated should have the right to know the names of those conducting the inquiry , if only to guard against personal or political malice . The public , acting as jury , should be given the background of witnesses , experts , and investigators and the amounts such persons are paid . Senator McCarthy is on solid ground , too , when he insists that the investigators should confine themselves to the precise matters under inquiry . McCarthy 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be permitted to obscure the importance of the issue he has raised . We have confidence that Senator Gillette and his colleagues ' will conduct a fair inquiry into the charges made by Senator Benton ; but there is every reason why the Senator from Wisconsin should be given the information he has demanded . " THE TRIUMPH OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM " would have been a fitting title for two speeches delivered at the opening session of the first International Conference of Manufacturers , which convened in New York on December 3 . Paul G. Hoffman , former Economic Cooperation Administrator , and Charles E. Wilson , president of General Motors , both advised the visiting European industrialists to modify Old World capitalism in favor of the American ' brand . In the last forty years , Mr. Wilson pointed out , the real income of workers in American manufacturing plants has increased an average of 21/2 per cent a year . But he failed to mention that part of this truly significant improvement was attained through the organization and militant effort of American workers and despite the resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wilson added , " that the workmen in all our countries recognize that they will share in increased productivity when it is achieved . " The workers of all countries , however , may not be easily convinced of this , for the Marshall Plan , whatever the intentions of its sponsors , has been carried out in such a way that industry 's increased profits have not been accompanied by improvement in the workers ' comparable position . According to Mr. Wilson himself , more than 75 per cent of all peoples have little choice between " working themselves to death or starving to death . " HOFFMAN TOLD THE VISITING EUROPEAN industrialists that " while you were going one way , toward the limitation of competition , we were going the other way , keeping it free , sharp , and painful . " He conceded , of course , that there were a few backsliders among American capitalists , but " any attempt on our part to avoid competition by entering into arrangements with our competitors puts us in danger of going to jail . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our government maintains a large staff of vigilant experts to see that they are lived up to and to plug up any leaks that might develop . " If unrestricted free competition has brought the grand results Messrs . Hoffman and Wilson describe , why are so many " vigilant experts " needed to police American industry ? GEORGE N. SHUSTER , RETURNING TO HIS Hunter College presidency after serving as United States Commissioner for Bavaria , is the latest of our officials to declare that the signs of a revival of Nazism in Germany are exaggerated by alarmists here and abroad . He adds , however , " I am afraid that if such a movement got started it would not provoke the energetic resistance to it that would be necessary . " On whether Germany is a threat to world peace he says , " It would take a long time for Germany ever to develop into a position where she could be a threat to anyone . " Despite these reassurances , a recent press item is disturbing . An A. P. dispatch from Frankfurt dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn by more than 30,000 Germans serving in Labor Service units attached to United States forces . " Blue-gray in color , the uniform is similar in pattern to that of the United States soldiers , including an Eisenhower-type jacket , but the Germans will wear a ski-trooper cap instead of the garrison cap of United States servicemen . " One wonders whether this distinction is sufficient to allay uneasiness over the last sentence of the dispatch : " Although they are officially described as civilian employees of the United States army , the Labor Service units are organized along military lines under former German army officers . " THIS ITEM FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF ONE from Tokyo which reports that the 75,000 man Japanese National Police Force  --  which is equipped with small arms , machine guns , mortars , and bazookas  --  will receive anti-aircraft guns , artillery , and tanks . This " hidden " army may be doubled in the near future . At present expansion is carried on by the use of the " reserve " rotary system , which during the Weimar Republic built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navy officers recently completed training under the program , and another four hundred are now in training . The only difference between the situation in West Germany and Japan today and Germany during the 1920 's is that remilitarization is being encouraged by the Allies . PARTS OF THE BELGIAN CONGO SUPPLEMENT to the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune of November 23 are certainly well suited to Soviet propaganda . There is , for example , the frank admission in the lead article that there are only 464 ' white - doctors in the Congo , one for each 40,000 inhabitants . Education is clearly designed to make the Congo natives good laborers and artisans . The government " feels that a great mass taught the three R 's and the fundamentals of hygiene is better than ' a handful of black graduates of Liege University . " Yet there are 2,000 black African students in English , Canadian , and American universities and a comparable number from the French overseas territories in French universities . The reason for the Belgian policy of not training a single black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivan de Thibault , acting governor-general of the Belgian Congo . The Belgian government , he writes , believes that December 22 , 1951 " the practice leads to discontent due to the inability of even the best-educated native to comprehend the European system . . . We think it is very dangerous to send the Congo native to Europe . " BUT THE MOST AMAZING ARTICLE IN THE supplement appears under the heading : " Race Segregation is Strict ; Blacks Seem Not to Resent It . " The opening paragraph declares that strict and complete segregation is " not a problem " in the Congo , for no one , least of all the blacks , has any " idea that there could possibly be any other arrangement . " Native trade unions , the article continues , " are strictly regulated and are led by whites . " There are no " native leaders " apart from the few who have been taken into the government in advisory or minor administrative posts . There are no native-language daily newspapers . The movies that the natives are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer tolerated . A few natives have been appointed to the governor 's administrative council and in perhaps twenty or thirty years , the vote may be given to whites and to natives who possess certain educational qualifications . " A representative government of blacks and whites will be the first result , with , of course , much stronger white representation than would be indicated by the relative numbers . A true democracy with universal suffrage is in. the far future . " Meanwhile Belgium is making sure that the Congo 's wealth is supporting the power that exploits it . The government has projected a ten-year plan for an investment of a billion ' dollars " to speed up the expansion of a country whose wealth has only been scratched to date . " A franker document has not come our way in some time . " Open Corruption Openly Arrived At " J OSEPH ALSOP has recently written three pungent columns on the source and scope of political corruption . Far from suggesting that revelations are almost complete , he indicates that after the investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office of Alien Property . There , if they " find the guts to stop scratching for peanuts and to begin digging for the big potatoes , " we shall find some really important scandals . Rejecting the notion that there has been a moral collapse in the United States , AlsOp ' believes that this contemporary corruption results " from certain vital changes in the relationship between business and-politics . " He notes the tremendously increased cost of election campaigns and agrees with Senator William Benton that this Is " the area of greatest ethical discomfort in American public life . " Where once Truman H. Newberry was expelled from the Senate for spending $200,000 to get himself elected , in 1950 two Senators are each reported to have spent more than $2,000,000 for campaign expenses . The result is that " business men and corporations pay at least 85 per cent of the .. political bills , mostly under the table . " For " business men will now pay almost anything to ease their dealings with the government . " However , this is no new development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt in almost direct ratio to the resources available for distribution to deserving business men . In an earlier period government could allocate land , timber and min-erg resources , franchises and charters . Now there are billions in defense contracts , legislation to be written in the private interest of oil and natural gas promoters , and tax concessions to be extorted . Because politics is " enormously important " to them ; Alsop implies that business men are hardly to be blamed for making the purchase . After all they buy " political influence that may be worth many millions for sums which they and their corporations hardly feel . " Furthermore , much of the cost is passed on to the citizen as business expense and reflected in higher prices . Thus the public pays for the corruption of its servants . What is the product of this corruption ? " Rows of Senators , " writes Alsop , " whose votes are controlled when the chips are down by the banks , the local utilities , the mining and mineral interests , and Other big business groupings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such complete acceptance of the commercial ethic that the United States Senate sees nothing extraordinary in LusIron Corporation 's contribution of $10,000 to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy . Washington is not alone in this politics for profit . According to Mr. Alsop , an unpublished survey showed that in 1948 , " more than half the state governments were dominated in this manner by various large business interests . " One may certainly agree with Mr. Alsop that moral prating is folly " when immoral behavior is the result of compulsion . " However , his suggested cures seem to stop short of fundamental reform . There is no doubt that American democracy must face up to the problem of election costs . Until we are prepared to demand public financing with enforceable laws against corrupt practices , politics will continue to be dominated by the highest bidder . Similarly there is no doubt that government service must be made a respected profession . In fact , tremendous strides toward this end have been made . But so long as our society stresses self-aggrandizement as the primary goal , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon work in the Internal Revenue- Bureau , for example , as " a way station en route to a corporate posi-540 lion ar a Washington law firm . " And so long as government service is looked upon as a stepping-stone to wealth and power , it will be difficult to uphold high standards of performance in government . Finally , one finds it ' difficult to accept Mr. Alsop 's picture of business men " treating the government like a huge , terrifying , hostile power . " Rather it appears that they look upon it as providing " the Great Barbecue . " Therefore , to have corporations , as Mr. Alsop suggests , assign executives to Washington " to study their problems with the government as they might study a plant lay-out or a sales territory " might eliminate the fees of influence brokers and save the lives of a few mink , but it would scarcely lessen the corruption of public officials . On the other hand , it does not follow that corruption is simply the price a democracy must pay for the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British example challenges this- cynical dogma . And our own national experience has shown , as during the New Deal , that the functions and the budget of the federal government may be enormously expanded without some new plunclerbund taking over . Unlike Franklin D. Roosevelt , Mr. Truman does not understand the importance of setting a proper " tone " for his Administration . This is strikingly apparent , for example , in his appointment of Judge Thomas F. Murphy to direct an inquiry into corruption . Judge Murphy did a fair clean-up job as Police Commissioner of New York , but he served as prosecutor under Attorneys General Clark and McGrath , and he could hardly have been appointed to the federal bench without the approval and support of the latter . That Mr. Truman should put him in charge of an investigation which must probe directly into the conduct of his former superiors is the best illustration of the President 's failure to understand the moral basis of leadership in a democracy .               @ @ @ @ @ @
