 | Divorce Is Going Out of Style ONLY A DECADE ago a host of sociologists and psychiatrists were grimly warning that marriage and family life in this country were dying institutions , headed at breakneck speed for history 's junk heap . " There is little left within the famy or the moral code to hold mariage together , " declared Harvard 's Carle C. Zimmerman , associate professor of sociology . " Marriage is in a chaotic state bordering on anarchy , " wrote Dr. arynia Farnham , New York City sychiatrist . " Along with the family t is designed to foster , it has become ore dilapidated and shopworn han it has been in centuries , if not n all history . " Behind such gloomy appraisals lay lie shocking fact that the U. S. divorce rate , after climbing gradually her more than half a century , had zoomed to an all-time high during 1946 . Grinding out a divorce decree every 51 seconds , our courts that year sanctioned the breakup of 61o , - 000 marriages . But since then , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate has trended steadily downward . Though the total number of married couples has increased by nearly seven million , our annual crop of divorces has decreased by 233,000 . The divorce rate today is barely half the 1946 rate . And it is still falling . All this has happened without any tightening of our divorce laws , without compulsory conciliation services , a federal divorce code , marriage subsidies or any of the other panaceas advocated by alarmists . Instead , a whole series of social and economic changes , unforeseen and unpredicted by the " experts , " have quietly  | combined to provide a firm new foundation for American family life . Back in the troubled ' 30 " ' s , hard times forced millions to postpone marriage until they were 28 or older . Then , when they finally took the plunge , many had become all too fixed in their spinster or bachelor habits , and were unable to adjust to double harness . Today 's young people , since they have not had to cope with a major depression , are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they embark upon matrimony while still pliant and adaptable . Since 1940 the average age at marriage has dropped by nearly two years . The typical bridegroom of 1957 has just celebrated his 22nd birthday ; his bride has a few months to wait for her 20th . Many marital counselors still advise against such youthful marriages as being among the most likely to end in divorce . But the principal props for this belief are two research studies conducted during the depths of the Great Depression . In those days , when only the emotionally unstable defied their elders and rushed impetuously to a justice of the peace , it did appear that early marriages cracked up somewhat more frequently than those of people who waited until their late 20 's to tie the knot . The girl of 19 and the boy of 21 who walk down the aisle today , however , often are far different from the wild , eloping kids of a generation ago . Usually they have tested their affection and loyalty for each other during three or four years - and often more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long engagement so highly valued in their grandparents ' day . They 've acquired an intimate knowledge and a deep tolerance of each others ' habits , reactions and attitudes . Thus. , marriage poses no overwhelming problem of adjustment . Nor does early marriage today compel couples to sacrifice their hopes for higher education . Married undergraduates now account liar nearly a sixth of the three million students enrolled in our colleges and universities . In the past , a prime cause of di vorce , especially among young brides and grooms , was sexual iii compatibility arising from fear , prudery and ignorance . Almost all of today 's young couples enter marriage with a far better understand ing of the physical and psychological aspects of sex than their parents ever had a chance to obtain . Until 1924 , for example , when Prof. Er-nest Groves started this country 's first course in Marriage and Family Living at Boston University , authoritative sex education was virtually unobtainable for most young people . Today nearly 7o percent of all colleges and more than l000 high schools offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen highly competent books on marriage from which much can be learned . Because parents today are better able and , often , more willing than  | in the past to help out their youngmarrieds financially , and because no one any longer thinks it a disgrace if the bride works , most current young couples feel no need to postpone childbearing " until things get better . " Nearly one third of today 's mothers are giving birth to their first child while they are still under 20 . In effect , since three out of five divorces occur among people who have no children , these energetic family builders have been providing themselves with the best possible marital insurance . It does n't always work out that way , of course , but it works often enough to have significantly influenced our divorce rate . Far more important , however , than the early pregnancies is the fact that almost all of these are eagerly wanted children . " Twenty-five or 30 years ago , " recalls Dr. Abraham Stone , dean of American marriage counselors , " most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to learn how they could limit their families to just one child or two . Now , almost without exception , the couples who come maintain that they want to have three or four or even five children . " Meanwhile , our growing prosperity has worked in a score of other ways to bolster marital happiness . Ten years ago nearly one family in every ten was sharing quarters with strangers or in-laws , and many a marriage foundered for sheer lack of privacy . Today , however , 97 percent of all married couples are able to maintain households of their own . Since 1940 , in a mass migration involving far greater numbers than did the peopling of the prairies , more than 25 million of us have left farms and cramped urban quarters to raise our burgeoning families in the suburbs . Sixty percent of American families now own their own homes , the highest percentage since frontier days , and this welds them together as no rented apartment ever could . The result , as anthropologist Margaret Mead points out , is that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard to believe . " The washing machines , diaper services , electric dishwashers for these homes give today 's mothers far more leisure to spend with their husbands and children than their mothers ever had . Shorter working days and longer week-ends give husbands the time they need to round up wives and kids for all sorts of family activities . The father 's relationship to his children has greatly changed . " The new family is one of the oddest that has ever been seen in the Western world , " explains Margaret Mead , " because the father has been allowed back into the nursery after being kept out for several thousand years . " He and his wife take turns giving the 5 a.m. bottle , for instance . And when he argues with his bride , it is likely to be because he insists that she does n't handle the diapering half as well as he can . Outside their homes , too , today 's young marrieds are sharing more  | activities than ever before . They participate together in PTA 's , church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women still flirt , and men still have roving eyes , but few have the time or , it would seem , the inclination for the all-out philandering that ends in divorce . For example , among the 21,340 families in a well-known suburban town , there were only 105 marital smashups last year . The divorce rate there , 4.9 per thousand married couples , was only half as high as our present nation-wide average and barely one quarter the U.S. rate of 1946 . In former years , much of the blame for our rising divorce rate was heaped upon women who continued to work after marriage . Sociologists pointed to the fourfold increase in the percentage of jobholding wives between 1890 and 1940 , and indicated it as one of the prime causes of the eightfold rise in the number of divorces over the same period . That pat theory has been demolished in the last decade . For the number of working wives and mothers has continued to soar while the divorce rate has tumbled . Today three out of every ten wives ? some 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homemakers . Their jobs , in fact , have turned out to be one of the strongest new factors making for marital stability . " During the difficult early years of marriage , " James Scull , of the Family Service Association , points out , " the wife 's job is often the means of assuring the husband a far larger in come later on . It helps him go lilt ther with education and professional training . It tides him over the lean months when he 's starting a business . " For other families , the wife 's earnings provide the nest egg that pays the obstetrician , meets the down payment on a better home , buys the new car . As one woman explained it , " On Jack 's 8o percent of our income we 'd just be getting along . It 's the 20 percent I bring in that takes the worry load off our shoulders . " Divorce rates have always been lower among men and women who are church members than among non-members . But the ability of our churches to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pastors of all faiths have been receiving in the techniques of marital counseling . The Catholic Church , for example , maintains more than moo priests who devote their time primarily to this work . Almost every major rabbinical seminary now includes courses in marriage and family counseling in its curriculum . A recent study of 27 Protestant seminaries revealed that all but one had made such courses a part of education for the ministry . Lay marriage-counseling services , non-existent in this country until 1929 when the first such center was opened in New York by Drs . Hannah and Abraham Stone , are today available in hundreds of communities . Increasingly , couples have been  | turning to them rather than to the divorce courts . In 1950 , for instance , the 265 Family Service agencies helped some 101,000 wives and husbands to resolve their marital disputes . By last year the number had increased to 150,000 . Even our courts have begun to change . Most of them still " try " divorce cases . But several states now have Conciliation or Family Courts , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help wives and husbands adjust their differences and forgo divorce proceedings . Out of 2074 divorce-bound couples in Los Angeles during 1954 and 1955 , 43 percent became reconciled with the help of Judge Louis Burke and his Conciliation Court staff . Toledo 's Court of Common Pleas has succeeded so well in its conciliation efforts , under the leadership of Judge Paul W. Alexander , that a dozen other Ohio cities now follow its example . No one knows , of course , whether our ten-year decline in divorces is merely a temporary shift in the longterm trend upward . But , barring another war or depression , it seems reasonable to expect our divorce rate ? still too high ? to continue to fall . For behind the new factors making for happiness in marriage lies a fundamental change . Divorces rose during all the years when women were battling for legal equality , the right to vote and the vision of shaking the world as " career girls . " Now the battle of the sexes has all but ended in total victory for the feminine contingent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men find security as equal partners in the building of their homes . For them , marriage is truly better than ever before . And for their children , raised in the security of happy marriages , it will probably be better still . @#
