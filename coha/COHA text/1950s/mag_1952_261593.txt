At the Convention <P> SIR : <P> ALTHOUGH A MEMBER OF THE DINOSAUR WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY , I OBJECT TO THE TACTICS OF SENATOR TAFT . THE STEAMROLLER HAS TO STOP . IT IS GOING TO STOP . THERE IS A DEAD END STREET IN CHICAGO . <P> KIMBALL PENNEY SAN FRANCISCO <P> Sir : <P> Your continual yammering about the " Taft machine " here and the " Taft machine " there , to the glory of smiling , lovable , everybody 's friend " Ike , " has left a rotten taste in the mouths of thousands of Taft boosters like myself ... If Ike does get the nod in Chicago , he 'll know what it is to be up against a machine ... <P> D. T. QUINN Brooklyn , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> Taft 's arrogance and highhandedness may win him the nomination in July but will lose him the election in November . The Republicans seem not to have profited by the lesson of Dewey 's defeat in 1948 . If the Republicans really want to win a presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign tactics of the Democrats . <P> EDWARD P. J. CORBETT Chicago <P> Sir : <P> Your recent articles on Taft and Eisenhower have been most informative , but can someone tell me why " Mr. Republican " does n't sit back and size up the situation as it actually exists and act accordingly ? ...

KNAUR Denison , Texas <P> Sir : <P> At the convention , Americans will have to choose between Senator Taft , whose whole political life seems to have been a preparation for the presidency , and General Eisenhower , an able , well-meaning and charming army man , with no background of political experience . <P> Those who are now shouting " I like Ike " forget that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sentimental hero worship . We worshiped F. D. Roosevelt , only to hear the charge that his policies at Yalta and elsewhere were responsible for strengthening Communism . We worshiped General Marshall , only to see him condemned for losing China to democracy . If , seemingly , our recent heroes have proved giants with feet of clay , what warrant is there for holding that Eisenhower-the glamour boy of the hour-will not bring us more , and bitterer , disappointments ? ... <P> ( THE REV . ) FRANCIS C. COPOZZI West Bangor , Pa . <P> Sir : <P> This is a plea to all delegates to the convention ... If you Republicans are statesmen and not mere politicians , you must realize that Eisenhower is ideally fitted to lead the country . He is a gifted organizer and a superb mediator . With the proper politically experienced helpers behind him ( not just bitter opponents to the Demo-donkeys ) , he could do more for the country-and the Republican Party-than a dozen didactic Tafts ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
