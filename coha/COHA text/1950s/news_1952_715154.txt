txt Mayor Impellitteri refashioned his transit fact-finding committee yesterday into a mediation group and directed it to begin today to find a way of preventing a strike on New Year 's Day by the Transport Workers Union , C. I. 0. , against eight private bus lines . , The committee will get to work this morning at the offices of the ' city 's Division of Labor Relations in the Municipal Building . This afternoon at 2 o'clock a joint medi ation session , to be attended by spokesmen for the New York City Omnibus Corporation , the Fifth Avenue Coach Company and the union , will be held . The peace-making body will begin its activities under something less than hopeful circumstances . Almost everybody connected with the bus crisis  --  including the committee itself  --  expressed open conviction yesterday that the strike Was inevitable . Only the Mayor refused to join the company of the Cassandras , saying that he still had hope the walkout could be averted . So certain was union president Michael J. Quill that a bus stoppage was a sure thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estimate , meeting most of the day , a proposal to provide extra emergency service on the city 's subway lines . Suggests City Hire Strikers The union plan , which had characteristic Quill audacity , suggested that the Board of Transportation , which runs the subways , take on as extra workers the 8,000 private line strikers on the theory that this reinforcement would be necessary to handle the 3,500,000 daily bus passengers who would have to ride subways in the absence of bus service . " It would be a fine way of getting them used to the forty-hour week , " said Mr. Quill , whose principal demand against the private bus companies is immediate institution of that work week . The Mayor was inclined to regard the suggestion as blarney and said he had been assured by Sid ney H. Bingham , chairman of the Board of Transportation , andl George P. Monaghan , Police Commissioner , that their departments I would be able to deal with any , situation that might arise from a strike against the private lines . The rumor was heard repeatedlyI in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal ap-1 peal to Governor Dewey for aid from the state in dealing with the transit crisis . Mr. Impellitteri refused to comment on this report , but the speculation received some backing when it was learned that at least one member of the Board , of Estimate had asked Mr. Quill if the union would be willing to give moraksupport by going to Albany with a city delegation , Mr. Quill , in revealing this information , said he had told the board member that , the union 's ' position always had been in favor of more state aid to the city but that the question of financing the forty-hour week was not the T. W. IL 's problem . The Mayor reaffirmed his stand that a fare increase was not the answer to the impending transit strike . He said further that he had not abandoned his plan for creation of an Omnibus Redevelopment Corporation covering all private and city surface operations under private management . The proposed corporation would be a limited dividend body with all profits over 5 per cent going to the city and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present franchise taxes. , This additional revenue , according to the Mayor 's plan , would be used to finance the forty-hour week de- ' mand . Mayor Seeks ' Reasonable ' Terms In announcing that his factfinders would now act as mediators  --  a title the committee had earlier abjured ? Mr. Impellitteri said the three-man group would " attempt to effect a reasonable settlement of the differences existing between the companies and the union . " The members are Victor Riesenfeld , business executive ; Joseph E. O'Grady , attorney , and Joseph Curran , president of the National Maritime Union , C. I. 0 . Daniel Kornblum , director of the Labor Relations Division , will work with them . " Mr. Mayor , " asked a reporter at an early evening press conference after a day of meetings , " nearly everyone else seems to think a bus strike Jan. 1 is inevitable . Do you ? " " The union seems to think so , " he replied . " That 's why I have set up this mediation committee ? to avoid a strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that gloomy prognosis . First thing in the morning the members of the factfinding committee  --  not yet redesignated as mediators  --  made a report to the Mayor on the state of negotiations and on their efforts to lead the parties into genuine collective bargaining . After reviewing , company by company , fruitless efforts to get talks going , the committee observed : " The companies and the union have been shadow boxing instead of bargaining . Whether or not this is part of a calculated plan to bring about the assurance of public funds , or increased fares , to finance a settlement , the fact remains that the proposals so far I made by the union on the hourly wage rate for the forty-hour week have elicited no substantive counter proposals from the companies I save in the instance of the Surface Transportation-Third Avenue System . " It may be that such counter proposals will soon be forthcoming as - and , when- real bargaining is lbegiui . Certain it is that the rate for the . forty-hour week as presently demanded by the union portends a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the demands of the union in the negotiations to date and the substantial revenues needed to finance the demands , a strike seems probable on the termination of the contracts on Dec. 31 , 1952 . " City Bars ' Blank Check ' Earlier in the report , which was not signed by Mr. Curran , who was reported ill , the committee pointed out that in previous negotiations it had " sought to dissuade the parties from any notion that the city either could or would hand out a signed blank check to underwrite the unknown cost of a settlement not yet reached and which might be improvident in amount and effect . " Here the committee was underlining the city 's primary concern in the bus dispute . The Mayor and his ? transit advisers  --  Mr. Kornblum , Edward C. Maguire , chairman of the Transit Advisory Commission , and Corporation Counsel Denis M. Hurley  --  are mainly concerned with the effect a private bus settlement would have on hourly rates paid by the Board of Transportation . The union 's demand for a shorter work week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for forty hours what they now receive for fifty hours . In the case of the New York City Omnibus Corporation and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , this would mean a new hourly ' rate of $2.17 . The present rate is In the case4bf the Third Avenue Transit Corporation , where the rate is now $1.66 an hour , , , the new rate would be about $2 . The city pays its bus drivers an hourly rate of $1.86 , which is one of the highest in the country . The contract between the city and the union expires Dec. 31 , 1953 , and the city is certain that if the union gets its demands from the private lines , the Board of Transportation would have to duplicate or better them a year from now . In a television broadcast last night Rudolph Halley , President of the City Council , said that a strike could be averted only if both companies and the union tempered their demands . He said also that a fare rise was not feasible because business would be driven to the suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit observers at City Hall yesterday were not certain that the fact-finding committee turned mediator had anything new to offer to the parties . Neither were ithe companies and the union . However , they were willing to try and , therefore , . will be represented at the meetings this morning .
