In Madrid last week , New York Timesman Sam Pope Brewer left his press card at the Spanish Ministry of Education for the renewal required every six months . Next day , Reporter Brewer was summoned to the ministry , told that his press credentials had been canceled because his reporting , and the Times 's " attitude , " had been " generally biased and unfair toward Spain . " He was told he would have to leave Spain by June 6 . <P> To Brewer and the six other U.S. correspondents in Madrid , * the news confirmed their suspicions that the Spanish government , which protests it has no censorship on outgoing news , is clamping down . <P> After he got the word from the ministry , Brewer tried fruitlessly to get an explanation from Spanish officials , then asked U.S. Ambassador Stanton Griffis for help . Ambassador Griffis cabled Washington for instructions . Finally , on State Department orders , he protested to the Spanish Foreign Ministry . <P> The strange part of the whole affair was that Newsman Brewer , 42 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job of reporting in his year and a half in Spain , has recently found fewer flaws and weaknesses to report . Moreover , the appointment of a U.S. ambassador last December had supposedly signaled a new , more friendly relationship between the two governments . Actually , that seemed to be the root of Brewer 's troubles . With full diplomatic relations reestablished , Spain apparently thought it safe to get tough with U.S. correspondents . <P> <P> * A.P .
