BREAKING POINT ( 92 pp. ) - Jacob Presses-World ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> How much inhumanity can a man bear to inflict on his fellow men before his conscience calls a halt ? The answer to this question is the substance of a harrowing little novel from Holland that combines the impact of a documentary film with the prodding of a remorseless sermon . The scene is Westerbork , a concentration camp in occupied Holland , from which Jews were sent on to Auschwitz , Sobibor and other extermination centers in Eastern Europe . The book 's real heroes and villains are Jews , while the Nazis are seen only as almost impersonal agents of evil . <P> Jacques Henriques , the narrator , goes to Westerbork before he has to . A high-school teacher , he goes because he has the offer of a job with the " Disposition Service , " the Jewish organization within the camp that really runs the grisly show for the Germans in charge . His boss is Siegfried Israel Cohn , a German Jew with years in concentration camps behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is prepared to outdo his masters in brutality . Carefully he explains to his new young " adjutant " that though all the Jews will reach Auschwitz in the end , the disposition crew will be the last to go . Each week a train leaves with its quota of victims . To postpone their fate a week , people are willing to pay huge sums . Women pay with their bodies , and Siegfried Cohn grandly takes his pick . Young Henriques catches on fast . Soon he is spying on the prisoners . He sees his own mother packed aboard , though he does manage to get her " a good seat between the water cask and the cask for excrement . " He leads his own former students to their death , carries the girl he loved in his own arms to her place on the train . <P> <P> Though indifferent to religion , Henriques is finally done in through his regard for a gentle religion teacher . Jeremiah Hirsch endures his fate better than most because he believes that even in Westerbork he walks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart and mind , achieves the near-impossible article of faith that even the Nazis are his brothers . Cynically at work saving his own skin , Henriques is yet fascinated by Hirsch 's stubborn spiritual strength . On the day Hirsch and his family are led to the train , all the suppressed guilt in Henriques boils to the top . Through a single act of revenge ( toward Cohn ) and kindness ( toward Hirsch ) , Henriques forfeits his life . In a desperate effort to expiate his sins , he writes the confession which is Breaking Point-and he writes hurriedly , because he is on the list for the next train to Auschwitz . <P> Author Presser , 58 , himself a Jew and a professor of history at Amsterdam University , lost his first wife in an extermination camp , lived in hiding in Holland until war 's end . What he has written is not a horror novel , despite its horrible theme . It is , rather , a deeply moving story of the terror that lies beyond remorse for the man who fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
