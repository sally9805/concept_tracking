txt A short time ago , Andrew Fischer , a milk driver of Roselle , Du Page county , built a little red wagon for his son , Craig , 3 . It was a very special red wagon for a very special reason . He worked patiently and lovingly over it for hours . He bolted a high back and sturdy arms on it . He made an extra long , handle so his wife could pull young Craig , who weighs 25 pounds , around in it . He also put a handle in the back to which Craig could cling to learn to walk .

Craig , you see , has had cerebral palsy since he was 4 months and can not hold himself upright or walk . The little red wagon helped him to do both . Last Friday night a petty thief stole the wagon from beside the steps of the Fischer home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Fischer explained yesterday .
