txt Corruption in Government To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Mr. Hoover , I see , is at it again . His denunciation of " public toleration of scandalous behavior , " of " the - mink coats , the deep freezers , the free hotel bills , " isivery stirring ' indeed . But how much more stirring Mr. Hoover 's attack on official corruption might have been had he chosen to make it when it really counted  --  that is , a generation ago , w. hen he was a member . of the Cabinet of President Warren G. Harding . ' Far from objecting to official corruption then , Mr. Hoover sat in entire complacency as Secretary of Commerce , while his colleague , the Secretary of the Interior . sought to loot the . Government of sums which make the deep freezers and free hotel bills Of the Truman Administration vanish into insignificance . Not only did Mr. Hoover fail to register any public objection to Secretary of the Interior Fall , or to ' Attorney General Harry . Daugherty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , 1923 , eight days after Fall 's hasty resignation from the Interior Department , Hoover wrote to him : " In my recollection , that department has never had so constructive and legal a headship as you gave it . I trust the time will come when your private affairs will enable you to return to public life . " Fall 's " constructive and legal " headship of the Interior Depart . " ment eventually , of course , caused him to be sent to the penitentiary . Mr. Hoover 's current appearance as , a guardian of ' the public morals assumes that the American people have completely forgotten the indisputable facts of his public record . ARTHUR SCHLESINGER Jr . Uambridge , Mass. , Sept. 1 , 1951 . Examination of Reasons Underlying ? . Controversy . Believed Necessary To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In ; your editorial of Sept. 5 " a plan for railroad peace " ? is proposed , involving the establishment of a technical board , appointed by the President , which would find a way out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going on for about two years . However ; in the course of the editorial you state that " at this late date it would be useless to attempt an assessment the exact reasons for the prolongation of this tangled controversy . " It - seems to the writer that the failure " to examine the reasons for the present controversy and the many railroad seizures of the past , decade will Lsimply result in the failure to ? resolve the controversy . There are certain basic reasons for this continuous labor conflict : First , over the years the - operating workers-those workers who are employed to work on the road and in the yards and who have'been primarily involved in the recent strikes  --  have seen their wage position deteriorate , as compared with the wages of other industrial workers . The reasons for this are the failure of the emergency boards , established by the President to investigate and report on the disputes , to use the same standards ' for wage determination , the virtual abolition of the right of railroad workers to strike , and certain defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , as amended , for the settlement of such disputes . Weapons Lost For all intents and purposes the railroad workers no longer have the right to strike . Recent court decisions have indicated that the President has the right to seize the railroads , particularly under certain war powers , and that injunctions can be issued by the courts , regardless of the Norris-La Guardia Act , to prevent railroad workers from going on strike . With the weapon of seizure and injunction over their heads the railroad workers have lost their sole weapons for collective bargaining . This gives railroad-management a superior bargaining position , since ' it knows . that it need not yield to the demands of the railroad workers at the early stages of collective bargaining . The procedures gone through for the resolution pf railroad labor disputes are usually prolonged and not conducive to the establishment of peaceful labor relations . Delay is bad from the workers ' point pf view , since they become restless . And it is not to the liking of the union leadership , which may be continually pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , the dispute between the carriers and the unions over the working rules is basic . The railroads have been anxious to eliminate the large number of working- rules on the railroads because it adds to their costs of operation . The unions , on the . other hand , are reluctant to yield on this question , because to them the working rules mean security for the workers as well as for the union itself . Nor will the unions ' agree to arbitrate these rules because of their fear that they may be amended or eliminated . And the reason for the position of the railroad uhions is understandable , even though one may not condone the union 's positioe , Rate ' Changes Third , the procedures established by the Interstate Commerce Commission for changes in the general rate level are such as to force the railroads to resist any wage demands and seek a reduction in operating-expenses . During periods of great economic activity the commission has been reluctant to grant general rate increases because it thinks that the increased volume of traffic will yield adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when economic activity is at a relatively low level , the railroads face serious competition from other means of transportation and can not afford to raise their rates . Thus , the railroads ' are in effect prevented frofn building up reserves during periods of prosperity to meet the difficulties of , say , a depression . cAs a result of this position of the commis  --  ion the railroads face no alternative but to resist the wage demands I of the workers and seek ways and means for reducing expenses by eliminating certain working rules . ? The problem of railroad labor disputes is exceedingly complex and any thought that a high-caliber board can resolve the problem appears to this writer to be rather naive . The issues go , deep and unless one understands some of the basic causes for the labor disputes one will not find a solution . The writer wished to emphasize that none of the explanations given above for the current problem is to be interpreted as ; an argument for higher wages , the ? continuation ? of the working rules , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand is not to condone . JACOB J. KAUFMAN . Lecturer in Economics , University of ' Buffalo . Buffalo , N. Y. , Sent . 6. 1951 . Practicing Segregation Visiting Students ' Experience With Discrimination Is Discussed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Since I am a colored student in America , though ' not a guest , I was intrigued by the subtle implications in your editorial of Sept. 5 concerning I racial segregation as it affects ex. change students inthis country . You state that - careful planning anti skillful guidance can pretty well prevent the opportunity for embarrassing incidents from arising . This , as Langston Hughes has well said , is " ignoring the truth of the physical for the sake of the mind , " but without helping the mind . No disease can be cured by ignoring it . The experience which colored students have in this country because of their color is part of their education to reality . Since they are already colored , it is not incredible to believe that they have previously suffered varying degrees of segregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and might have some constructive thinking to de ? vote to the race problem and its solution . Skillfully to guide colored students away from areas where segre ? gation is- practiced , is like touring an exclusive residential district and image ining that slums ' do not exist . If , as your editorial says , " every colored student who is humiliated while ? a guest of our country is all too likely to go home an enemy rather than a ' friend of the United States , " then what of that lad and larger company of colored students who are- Americans and permanent residents ? They are no less sensitive and certainly no leis the victims of racial , embarrassment and - humiliation . And . therbaye no other home to whick , thPY can , flee or return . Is it equally . reasonable to suppose that these colored students-may also be enemies of the United States , rather than friends ? Many colored citizens are ; of course , more resigned ' than nnmune to racial segregation and its painful embarrassment Those who are not resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opposition . In addition , the feelings of rejection sand insecurity and the sick psychological blocks built up in an American Negro are awesome in their conception and tragic in their conse-quences : We should , therefore , take pains to exhibit the entire fabric of our coml. try , rather than pass it off as the ' whole cloth , when there are obvious flaws . By not making a secret of the short ? Comings in our democracy we invite new thinking to an ancient problem , It beats the Communist propagandists to the punch , who so delight in making political capital of racial segregation in America . BRUCE . WRIGHT . Diew York , Sept. 6 , 1951 . We entirely agree that it ' would be pointless to try ' to hide front foreign exchange students  --  or from anyone else  --  the unhappy truth that there is such a thing as segregation in the United States , nor did - our editorial recommend such a course . But we do not think it necessary for our country 's - guests to be personally subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate the fact that it still exists. ? Editor , - THE Tams . Faulty Highways and Accidents To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Yoex Tams : G. E. Kidder Smith in a recent letter from Rome claims that the hazard ; of motoring in this country are due not to excessive speed but to faulty highways which are far behind the modern highways , of Italy and Gent many , where speed limits do not exist . ' The current rate of fifty-five miles an hour on the Merritt Parkway and the proposed limit of seventy miles per hour for the New : York State Thruway are excessive and hazardous considering the comparatively myriad number of autos and all types of drivers on our highways today . It would be pleasant to enjoy the freedom of the road with no worry , about limits or tickets , but such a policy . could only be feasible in- such places where only a minority of : the popular . ton drive cars .
