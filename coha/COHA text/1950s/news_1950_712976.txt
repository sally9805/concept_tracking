txt TOKYO , June ** occupation authorities and the Japanese Government are now considering stronger measures to control violent Communist demonstrations here as a result of the Memorial Day incident in which five United States soldiers were attacked in the Imperial Palace Plaza while on duty watching a meeting of a " racial " front Communist organization . Eight Japanese who had been arrested in the Memorial Day incident were found guilty Saturday in United States Army court of attacking American soldiers , said a United Press dispatch . One man got a ten-year prison term , six seven years each and the eighth five years . The Japanese police have now canceled permission for a further mass meeting by the Metal and Automobile Workers unions in Hibiya Park , in the heart of Tokyo , ' scheduled for tomorrow . Police said that the permit for the meet , ing had been refused because the application by the unions , both of // which are strongly Communist , had been improperly formulated . It is freely stated , however , that the demonstration will not be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident " involving the Allied forces , which the Communists are now attempting to provoke . Demonstrations are also scheduled tomorrow by university students who are members of the Communist All Students League of Autonomous Organizations . These are to be held in Tokyo , Osaka and in the Kansai and Tohoku districts . The student demonstrations have been frankly billed as " anti-American strikes " along the lines of the incident in which Tohoku University students recently refused to hear Dr. W. C. Eels of the Supreme Command 's Civil Information and Education Section . Thus far the police have taken no action to stop the student demonstrations . Still in Planning Stage According to informed political circles , the measures that the Government is considering to end further Communist incidents are still in the planning stage but they number about half a dozen , all calculated to impose tighter control . They were discussed , it is understood , at a meeting today between the chief Cabinet Secretary , Katsuo Okazaki , and Maj. Gen. Charles A. Willoughby , Intelligence Officer for Gen. Douglas . Japanese sources consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they immediately follow the Government 's declaration yesterday that it is willing to sign separate treaties with the West  --  thus thoroughly turning down the thesis of the Japanese , Chinese and Soviet Communist parties that the only treaty permissible for Japan is one in which the Soviet Union and China are willing to join . Informed Japanese circles have stated that the Government 's proposal on the treaty  --  announced formally by the Foreign Office ? was intended as a counterblast to the Communists ' campaign of intimidation here . According to the most recent information , Government spokesmen have now presented to the Allied Command half a dozen proposals curbing Communist activities . One is to outlaw the Communist party , which General has twice suggested in messages to the Japanese people . This apparently is still rejected , however , Premier Shigera Yoshida , in a campaign speech at Mito for Sunday 's election , said today that the Government " for the present " had no thought of taking such measures . Mr. Yoshida left open , however , the question of whether illegalization might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlined by General Willoughby , who told the correspondents that the occupation would net forever tolerate the use by the Communists of the freedoms given to the Japanese by , the United States to tear down the democratic system that the Americans were trying to install here . The general theory has been that the Communist party would be more dangerous than at present if it were driven underground . The party itself was reported to have made all preparations to operate outside the law  --  including concealment of important records and eliminating from its rolls the highest local leaders . However , apparently there is no intention yet of going to this extreme . The regulations that apparently will be put into effect would control much more strictly public demonstrations , on which the Communists have relied to circulate their propaganda and attempt to disturb the generally peaceful course of Japanese reconstruction . Mr. Okazaki told the press that the Government would push for regulations that demand , first , that an organization " really responsible " for any public demonstrations be clearly named .

Third , when trade unions and other organizations ask to use public property for demonstration purposes non-organization members shall be excluded . The Communists are known to have packed many meetings with their own adherents to give the impression that this or that organization was following the Communist line . Fourth , Mr. Okazaki said , no demonstration should be allowed to interfere with city traffic . One Communist means of calling attention to party meetings has been the holding of interminable parades that force all vehicles to detour . Most marchers were paid for their time by the Communist party , which extorts funds from employers under threat of calling a strike if their demands are not met . It is not known whether the Japanese Government or the occupation or both , which hitherto have been unwilling to face a showdown with the Communists , actually insist upon these measures  --  which Parliament undoubtedly would be willing to pass .

P )  - -  The Communists ' loudly-boasted " March on Tokyo " fizzled into a slow shuffle today  --  and disbanded within two hours with no violence and no parade . After skirting a police ban against mass outdoor demonstrations , the Communists managed to rally 5,000 Japanese in and around a small building rented from the Red Cross . With a police station just across the street  --  and 25,000 to 27,000 police alerted for instant action ? speakers carefully avoided their announced anti-American theme . Communist leaders , who had called for a nation-wide strike , tried belatedly to deny having anything to do with the aborted demonstration . Early in the afternoon , the rally disbanded with the singing of " The Internationale . " Then the participants started homeward . The police ban extends until Monday to prevent any mass demon.H strations until after Sunday 's election of Councillors ( National Senators ) .                   @ @
