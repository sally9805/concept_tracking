IN THE widest view , the expedition of Lewis and Clark must be seen as the culminating episode in the effort , almost three centuries old , to find a water route across North America . In a somewhat more limited view it must he seen as the first decisive move ? the first decisive one under the Republic , that is , for there had been others under the Confederation ? in the process of expansion which eventually carried the United States to the Pacific and completed its occupation of a continental unit . The ostensible purpose of the expedition was to explore the vast area called Louisiana ( including all French possessions west of the Mississippi ) that had just been acquired from France . Yet Jefferson ordered the expedition before there was any hint that more than New Orleans was to be acquired , and indeed was resolved to order it when he took office in 1801 , before any American knew that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France . Of the many purposes the expedition was to serue , three had absolute importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover a route ? by way of the Missouri and the Ohio ? by which the furs of the Canadian Northwest could be transported to American ports more cheaply than the North West Company could transport them to Montreal by its long and infinitely laborious route . This was an open , declared form of trade imperialism . But also the expedition was to connect the Missouri River with the great river which Captain Robert Gray , the discoverer of its mouth , had named the Columbia after his ship . By so doing it would discover an inland water route , much shorter than the oceanic one and protected from naval power in time of war , for the sea-ottertrade of the Northwest , the greatest exterior wealth the United States had . Finally , it was to resist the purpose of the North West Company to extend British sovereignty over the Columbia River , the land north of it west of the Rocky Mountains , and if possible all Louisiana north of 45 ? . Whether or not these last two purposes were " imperialistic " depends on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the United States had no claim to land west of the Rockies ? and none to Louisiana when the expedition was authorized ? and since Jefferson was not acting in a fit of absent-mindedness , it seems fair to call his intention imperialistic , or , in the softer term usually preferred by historians , " expansionist . " The article that follows will form part of my book , The Course of Empire , to be published in October , a study of three centuries of exploration and imperial conflict in the area of the United States and Canada . ? B. DeV . THEY would not get back to the States this year , Lewis wrote to President Jefferson from the bank of the upper Missouri River , but they expected " to reach the Pacific Ocean and return as far as the head of the Missouri , or perhaps to this place , before winter . " And , " Entertaining as I do the most confident hope of succeeding in a voyage which has formed a darling project of mine for the last ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as among the most happy of my life . " Thus Meriwether Lewis , who had the wilderness in his heart , on April 8 , 1805 , when they headed into the unknown . During the preceding summer the Lewis and Clark expedition ; forty-five strong , had ascended the Missouri River to the mouth of Knife River , near Stanton , North Dakota . There they had spent the winter in a log post which they called Fort Mandan , near two villages of Mandan Indians and three of Minnetarees ? semi-sedentary tribes who lived in great sunken houses called earth lodges . These , the " Mandan villages " of the history books , were the center of British trade penetration from Lake Winnipeg and the Assiniboine River . The two captains had occupied the winter months asserting American jurisdiction over the Indians , cultivating friendship and establishing trade relations with them , clarifying American foreign and domestic policy for visiting traders of the North West Company and the Hudson 's Bay Company , and acquiring from the Minnetarees an astonishing amount of information about the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Rocky Mountains . Now with the reduced party which they called " the corps of discovery " they were ready to resume their great journey . Besides Lewis and his fellow officer , William Clark , the exploring party consisted of three sergeants , twenty-three privates , York , Drewyer , and Charbonneau , Charbonneau 's Shoshone Indian wife Sacajawea , and her twomonths-old son Baptiste or Pomp . They had the two pirogues which grew steadily less handy as the river grew steadily more difficult , and to take the place of the keelboat had built six cottonwood dugouts . These were unquestionably the best craft for the swift and shallow Missouri , choked with snags and sandbars and forever catapulting logs at them . Lewis did not feel easy about the dugouts except when they were being towed , and towing meant staggering through bush and marsh and mire , and climbing or careening along the Bullied edges of bluffs when the channel was inshore . That and jumping out to shove the heavy craft off the myriad bars were cold work in April . Though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great flights of wildfowl were arriving , however . One who travels those reaches of the Missouri by boat today can still see . remnants of thuse.flights big enough to give hint some sense of what the unspoiied time- vrat like ? black cormorantstrailing their legs as they fly , pure white and stately pelicans , herons , teal , pintails , greenheads , " duckinmallards , " geese ? everywhere the flash of woodpeckers through matted willows , kingfishers , owls , hawks , gulls , sometimes an eagle . But though many beaver dive from the bank as the boat approaches , there is nothing else to suggest the incredible hosts of game the expedition found in 1805 . They had only to walk inland from the bank to kill anything they might want in quantity , Lewis says . It was mere sport for him or Clark to kill meat for thirty-one in the course of a stroll ? buffalo , elk , deer , antelope in fabulous numbers ? and soon , amazed , they met the bighorn and presently the grizzlies , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tering and strangling rain . Against the trailing black gauzes of the storm cottonwood trunks are a pale pure silver and their buds the pale green of the sky at daybreak . Few boats ever travel the river through the Breaks now ? not , at least , beyond the hundred-mile reservoir of Fork Peck , Montana . An airplane flight , with the pelican-galleons white below instead of above , shows why they have been called breaks instead of badlands : occasional wide intervals of meadows or even timber interrupt the frantic chaos of the buttes . From above or below , however , they are chaos , tumbled , precipitous , bizarrely modeled , bright-colored , drab , monochrome , or splashed with white or mottled with primary reds , and transformed with every change of light in a vastness where light is never long the same . When the expedition reached the Breaks their strangeness assailed these poised men . In their journals almost for the first time the word " beautiful " means something other than " fine country for settlement . " Wool uniforms and cowhide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be buckskins and moccasins . Three " Frenchmen , " presumably some of those who had wintered at Fort Mandan , traveled with them for a while to trap these entirely untrapped waters , but how far they went does not appear . On April 14 , a week out , beyond the mouth of the Little Missouri , coming into the last arc of the Big Bend that turns the river full west , they named a small watercourse Charbonneau 's Creek , since he had once camped on it with the Minnetarees . And Lewis wrote , " This was the highest point to which any whiteman had ever ascended except two Frenchmen one of whom was the Le Page they had enlisted at the villages who having lost their way had straggled a few miles further . " They went on into the wholly new . II T HE river was beginning its spring rise but fluctuated and there was never enough water where it was needed , which meant they must use the towropes . It was flawed spring weather , with snow flurries bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oar-blades as they royed . They reached the greatly desired White Earth River on April 21 and it disappointed them ? too small . But it widened and had flood water upstream and Lewis wrote that it must extend at least to 50 ? and must be navigable to its source and must be " no great distance from the Saskashawan Saskatchewan . " They must find such a river to fulfill the President 's mission , but their desire to reach the Yellowstone was greater still and Lewis hurried overland to it ahead of Clark , who brought the boats to the great confluence on April 26 . ( It is just east of the Montana-North Dakota line . ) Now first seen by white men , it was a noble river . The country it flowed through seemed magnificent and both captains summarized in their notebooks all the lore about it they had stored up and written down before . They noted that its curiously colored water was without sediment ? today it carries far more silt than the Missouri ? and debated the best site for the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone or brick post for there was little timber . On May 3 , six days beyond the Yellowstone , the urgency to get behind the British posts found promising substance at last . They reached what seemed to be just such a river leading north . It was the inconsiderable stream now called Poplar River but the heavy winter snows were melting and its flood plain , like that of the White Earth , was handsomely full of runoff . They needed it , and Lewis did not doubt that its source was " not far from the main body of the Suskashawan river and that it is probably navigable 150 miles ; perhaps not far distant from that river . " By big boats too , and " should this be the case it would afford a very favorable communication to the Athebaskay country , from which the British N. W. Company derive so large a portion of their valuable furs . " 0 N MAY 8 a bigger river came quietly flooding in from the north and , a hard blow holding them up , they reconnoitered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? from a pinnacle Clark thought he could see fifty or sixty miles " level and beautiful , " with big herds of buffalo . It forked and one fork made straight north . So " perhaps this river also might furnish a practicable and advantageous communication with the Saskashiwan river . " Now they had three , which ought to be enough . This was a hundred miles short of where they had expected to find the one they had called the Scolding River , or as the Minnetarees put it " the river which scoalds at all others . " Nevertheless it must be that river ? they must have estimated the mileage wrong last winter ? for the Indians had described only two northern tributaries large enough to satisfy their requirements . Disregarding the White Earth as perhaps too small or too short , they had now passed both , the Poplar and the Scolding . They were satisfied but they rechristened this one , giving it a name for its " peculiar whiteness , " like a cup of tea with a tablespoonful of milk added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again flood stage had deceived them . Long habituated to drinking Missouri water , they found the alkali of increasingly bitter creeks strongly purgative when they tried it . They saw sonic Indian sign but no Indians and were content , for hereabout they would probably have been Assiniboins and therefore troublemakers . By now rattlesnakes were an old story and the fury of grizzlies was just as familiar and had taught everyone respect . And Sacajawea had long since proved her value . She was always busy , digging edible roots they were familiar with and finding novel ones , tailoring buckskins , making moccasins , explaining novelties , cool and swift in emergencies . . . . She is remarkable , this Indian girl who may have been no more than seventeen in 1805 , and of whom no word is directly reported since she could speak only Shoshone and Minnetaree . She is better known than any other Indian woman and she has unusual resourcefulness , staunchness , and loyalty , a warmth that can be felt through the rugged prose of men writing with their minds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet not the childishness we have associated with primitives . All the diarists liked her , Lewis gave her a detached admiration , Clark delighted in her , and she has charmed the imagination of readers ever since Nicholas Biddle wrote his book. * In so much that she has become a popular heroine and something of a myth , a Shoshone Deirdre created out of desire . And from Bismarck to the sea many antiquaries and most trail-markers have be History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark ( 1814 ) , compiled from the notes and journals of the expedition . lieved that Lewis , Clark , and their command were privileged to assist in the Sacajawea Expedition , which is not quite true . On May 19 they saw peaks to the north , the isolated range called the Little Rockies which eager travelers always and mistakenly believe to be the beginning of the Rockies . ( A national forest named Lewis and Clark includes them now , and the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation stretches beyond them to the north . ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit his leg so badly that Lewis feared he would bleed to death . The next day they reached the Musselshell and their information was vindicated , for they had expected to find it just where it was . In the Breaks , loose soil made sandstorms of all gusts of wind and an epidemic of sore eyes ensued . Experience was adding up ; Lewis amended ideas about climates and soils that had been too generous and Clark refined Indian geography to closer approximations . On May 25 Clark thought he saw more mountains and the next day climbed a hill and made sure . Like the Musselshell , these mountains were where the data said they should be ; they must be the Indians ' first range . Perhaps those to the north were the ones now called the Bear Paws and those to the southwest the Highwoods , but the angle of sight joined them to other ranges and they were so far away that only snowy tips could be seen . Lewis wrote , " I felt a secret pleasure in finding myself so near the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premonition of the strain to come struck through his exultation . It was nearly always the towrope now and the wind forever full of sand . At the end of the clay fatigue felled a man like a club but dinner of buffalo ribs or bighorn chops or boiled beaver-tail was restorative . Driftwood fires bowed and flared to the high wind and Cruzatte , the riverman , would fiddle for dancing till the flames sank and only the glow of embers was reflected from the water . On May 29 a clear bold river came in from the south . Lewis named it Big Horn but Clark pointed out that the map already had a Big Horn emptying into the Yellowstone . So he called it Judith for Judy Hancock , who was only thirteen now but whom he was destined to marry in 1808 . There were many signs of Indians , an encampment two weeks old and big ? 126 lodges , Lewis made it ? and another , older camp near by . Sacajawea identified Atsina moccasins , the Fall Indians , probably raiding her own people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compelled to be in the water even to their arm pits " a full quarter of the time and , when they were n't , had to take the rope slitheringly across mire barefooted and drag " the heavy burden of a canoe ... walking occasionally for several hundred yards over the sharp fragments of rock " that had fallen from the cliffs above . They came out to the plains country again and now the mountains were not so distant and wild roses had bloomed in the bottom and cactus on the banks . On June 2 no one had been able to wear moccasins while towing for the last several days and " many of them have their feet so mangled and bruised . . . that they can scarcely walk or stand . " On that day the current was more gentle , a grizzly chased both Drewyer and Charbonneau before Drewyer shot it through the brain ? and they reached " a very considerable river . " III s o CONSIDERABLE a river that the Missouri seemed to have forked . To encounter a big river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known to fork below the Three Forks . Above the Scolding River , which they assumed they had passed a month ago , no important tributary entered from the north . Above the Musselshell , two weeks behind them , no tributary of even moderate size entered from the south . Months of inquiry and of analysis had made this clear , and maps sketched in sand by war chiefs and on paper by William Clark had plotted the Missouri all the way to the mountains and the easy pass leading to the southern branch of the Columbia . None of those maps showed such a crossroads as this . And once more it was a big river only because of the big runoff ? actually it is small . So they must determine which fork led to the mountains , which was the main stream of the Missouri , and they must decide correctly . For if they decided on the wrong one and , going up it , eventually had to come back to the other ? then that error " might defeat the expedition altogether . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific , perhaps no getting across the mountains , before winter . Their supplies being steadily depleted , they would have to go hack to St. Louis in failure , the continent uncrossed , no route discovered , Jefferson frustrated , and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States perverted . Almost the entire party , including the expert rivermen , whose top authority was Cruzatte , decided during the first afternoon that the north fork was the Missouri . Dissenting from the first , Lewis and Clark were convinced by the end of the next day that it was riot , though convinced too that both must be explored . All but conclusive arguments against both could be drawn from the Indians ' information and from the analysis the captains had subjected it to . In every respect except that the Missouri had not been known to trend north ( and even this might have been sanctioned by data acquired after Clark made his map ) the north fork looked like the Missouri . Its water had the same brown-mud color that the Missouri had all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the same velocity they had recently been facing . Its bed was the exhaustingly familiar muddy bottom of the Missouri . One would say that it was the Missouri continuing . To the contrary , the south fork was " perfectly transparent . " It had a swifter current . It flowed over a bed of " flat smooth stones . " It was not continuous with the Missouri but an abrupt change and novelty . Yet it was the bigger river , it bore southwest which was the anticipated direction , and the very novelties that changed its character argued that it was the Missouri . For rocky beds and clear water were characteristic of rivers that came down from mountains not far away , and the Minnctarees had made it sure that the Missouri entered mountains at a not much greater distance than the expedition had now traveled . They had insisted too that it traveled through mountains for a long distance . The turbidity and the mud bottom of the north fork argued that it did not penetrate the mountains , or that it made too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the waters as the Missouri was known to come , or that on emerging from the mountains it traveled across plains for a much greater distance than the Missouri was known to travel up to this point . And for this conclusion there was support in the size of the south fork ; it could get so much water only from deep penetration in mountains , not from country so dry as they knew the country to be between it and the Yellowstone River . ( The barrenness , the succession of tiny creeks , and the big dry runoff channels all indicated the same thing . ) Again , the Minnetarees had said that the Great Falls were on a bearing a little to the south of sunset from Fort Mandan . Determination of the latitude showed that this confluence was only a few minutes north of Fort Mandan . The strong southwestward bearing of the south fork squared with these data , the strong northerly bearing of the other fork would not square . But against the south fork was the weighty fact that , as their Arrowsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ranged down the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains to 45 ? and he had not encountered a stream anywhere near so large . The latitude they had taken was 47 ? 24 ' . If Fidler had reached 45 ? then this south fork must enter the mountains even farther south than that ? which was farther south than they had calculated the head of the Missouri and the all-important pass to be . If the north fork was the Missouri , why had n't the Indians mentioned the south fork ? If the south fork was the Missouri , then the north fork must he the Scolding River ? and how could the Indians , or they themselves , have so seriously erred about its distance from Fort Mandan ? IV T HUS Lewis and Clark on the first after- noon and the next day . They went to to the top of the highest hill ? not very high , only the groundswell of the plains . Snowcapped mountain ranges rimmed the horizon in a gigantic arc southwest , west , and northwest . ( The ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily the Big Belts . ) Above and beyond them was the faintly sketched , spectral substance of farther ranges shining in the diamond air . The rest was " one vast plain , " with buffalo herds , " their sheppards the wolves , " elk herds , " solatary antelope , " and the yellow and pink flowers of opuntia . But they could not make out the courses of the two rivers . . . . They MAGAZINE talked it out exhaustively : " thus have our cogitating faculties been busily employed all day . " As often as they cared to re-examine their information and the conclusions they had drawn from it , they were compelled to decide , on the sum of the evidence , that the north fork was a plains river and the south fork a mountain river . They would therefore eliminate the north fork . It must rise east of the Rockies and south of the Saskatchewan . It could not penetrate the first range of the Rockies . Most of its sources must he north rather than west , toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , the key to much of their thinking ) . They were right . The north fork was the Scolding River . The south fork was the Missouri . The commanders of a momentous exploration thus answered the question that must be answered right if the expedition was not to fail . At this critical turning point , with immediate failure hanging in the balance , the answer is co-operative and joint . It is Lewis who writes down the reasoning in the Journals , but this analysis is as clearly Clark 's as his , for it was Clark who had formulated the winter 's data , had checked and rechecked and tabulated it , and must now first check it again for unperceived possibilities of error in calculation or in reasoning . And this joint effort is a remarkable act of the mind . Considering all that went into it and all that depended on it , it must be conceded a distinguished place in the history of thought . It is the basic method of science ; they searched the information for what it was and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mean and imply . The methods of agreement and of difference had . been applied and a conclusion reached . Now for verification . . . . They had sent squads up each fork in a dugout and another one overland ; no significant observations had resulted . Now they would themselves go up the.forks till they could be sure . They started on June 4 , Clark up the south fork , Lewis up the north one . Clark was sure on the second day , after fifty-five miles of travel , forty-five on a true course . Throughout that time the south fork continued to be a mountain river . Its bearing was always much to the west of south and therefore toward the mountains , which were the Big Belts . It nowhere made so southerly a bearing as it must if Fidler had correctly stated his farthest south . It must be the river that led into the Rockies and on toward Columbia waters : it must be the Missouri . Lewis was sure on the third day . The north fork " had its direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westering ? to take them a significant distance toward Columbia waters . It could not he the Missouri . EWIS was right . Yet the river would have led them to Marias Pass , which crosses the Continental Divide . ( Just south of Glacier National Park . ) Except for the great portal of the West , South Pass through which the American emigration moved to the Pacific , it is the only pass by which wagons could cross the Divide ? and the short summer of the north closed it to emigrants . Lewis and Clark could not have taken their boats into Marias Pass , and beyond it to the west they must have traveled a sore distance before taking to a river route again . Yet , theoretically , a water-crossing to the Pacific , that fantasy which had so powerful a hold on the imagination of men , could have been found by that approach . Theoretically only , but truly . From Marias Pass they would have come down to the Flathead River and that would have led them to Clark 's Fork , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their dugouts to the Snake . Clark 's Fork would have taken them to Pend Oreille Lake and beyond that its extension , which is sometimes called Pend Oreille River , would have taken them to the Columbia at almost exactly 49 ? , more than three hundred miles above the mouth of the Snake . Though not , the Missouri , it was in Lewis 's judgment a noble river , and he named it the Marias , to commemorate one of his many romantic attachments . He was confident that the land it watered was as fertile as he had seen it was picturesque . It must be rich in furs too . And once more he sounded the compelling ? and revealing ? theme . With so northerly a bearing it must rise north of 49 ? and so was " destined to become in my opinion an object of contention between the great powers of America and Great Britin with rispect to the adjustment of the Northwestwardly boundary of the former . " And it " most probably furnishes a safe and direct communication to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects of his Britanic Majesty . " This was the fourth river that Lewis and Clark had decided would enable the United States to get behind the North West Company , flank it , and tap the richest beaver trade . They had been looking for one ever since they started talking to the Minnetarees last November . Why ? Only one explanation is possible : they had been directed to find a route of water transport that would undercut the British . Back at camp they put it all together again on June 9 and were , once more , sure . The south fork was the Missouri River and was therefore the route to the Rockies . It must reach them north of 45 ? . Mr. Fidler must have been wrong . During the winter , on Clark 's map , they had already moved his farthest south up to 46 ? , relying on the sum of what they had learned . Now they decided that he could not have gone farther south than 47 ? . ( Actually he did not reach 490 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south fork . The men unanimously believed them wrong . They determined to leave the larger pirogue here , secured it , and made caches for their heaviest tools and for sizable stores of concentrated foods , lead , and powder . If they were right , then the Great Falls could be at no great distance ; in fact Clark could not have been far short of them when he turned back . On June 11 , leaving Clark to bring up the boats , Lewis started overland to find out , taking Drewyer , the Field brothers , and Goodrich with him . Suspense was strong on the twelfth but the plains were majestic , the distant mountains beautiful , and they killed two grizzlies at the first shot ( which had never happened before ) ; and that night they dined on mountain trout , for Goodrich was a mighty fisherman . Well before noon the next day Lewis heard the sound of a waterfall and , far away , saw spray like a column of smoke rise above the plain , drift , disappear , and rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) He pressed on in the direction of that fluctuant mist and soon heard " a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri , here I arrived about 12 OClock having traveled by estimate 15. miles .
