Wave upon wave of applause filled a circus tent in Hamburg last week as a preposterous , shambling clown , his baggy pants secured by a huge safety pin , his crudely gloved hands the essence of misplaced elegance , finished his turn . Friends and fans had come from as far away as Italy and England to see his act . They stood on their chairs , stomping and cheering . Long after the clown himself had shuffled off , wiping a tear from his dead-white face with a floppy sleeve , the cheers ran on , until at last a loudspeaker blared : " Please , ladies and gentlemen , do not applaud any longer . Grock is not coming back . Grock is never coming back . " <P> The audience of 3,000 found it hard to believe that The Great Grock would ever give up the limelight and the sawdust , but the fact was that at 74 , Europe 's greatest clown was tired . As Adrian Wettach , the son of a Swiss watchmaker , he ran away from home at 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played in circuses and music halls across the length and breadth of Europe and England . On a continent where clowns are universally rated as the top act in any circus , Grock was acclaimed as the greatest of them all . The Queen of Spain once gave premature birth to a royal heir from laughing too hard at his antics . Winston Churchill once urged him to take out British citizenship so that Britons might claim him as their own . Even Charlie Chaplin was once kind enough to concede that Grock was almost as good as he . <P> Offstage a solemn and fastidious artist who speaks seven languages and boasts an honorary Ph.D. , The Great Grock spent hours and years polishing and perfecting the details of his performance . But he never tampered with its essential ingredients , which were as simple and absurd as life itself : a tiny fiddle produced from a monstrous case , the almost miraculous discovery that it is easier to push a stool toward a piano than it is to push a piano toward a stool , his look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself . In such endless re-enactment of simple and simple-minded truth , everyman could forget his own absurdity and laugh instead at Crock 's . <P> Last week , soon after the curtain fell for the last time on his act , Grock and his devoted Italian wife headed for retirement and a 50-room villa on the Italian Riviera . He had earned his rest without question , " but who , " asked one of the million-odd friends he had left behind , " will ever be able to make us laugh like that again ? "
