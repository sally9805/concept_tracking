FIRST LENSMAN THE LENS 41so she did n't need much servicing . Flit ! " They flitted , and the great battleship made the second cruise as uneventfully as she had made the first . The Chicago'sofficers and crew knew that the young people left the vessel separately ; that they returned separately , each in his or her lifeboat . They met , however , not in the control room , but in Jack Kinnison 's private quarters ; the three young Lensmen and the girl . The three were embarrassed ; ill at ease . The Lenses were  --  definitely  --  not working . No one of them would put his Lens on Jill , since she did not have one ... The girl broke the short silence . " Was n't she the most perfectly beautiful thing you ever saw ? " she breathed . " In spite of being over seven feet tall ? She looked to be about twenty  --  except her eyes  --  but she must have been a hundred , to know so much  --  but what are you boys staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted as one . " Yes . She . Why ? I know we were n't together , but I got the impression , some way or other , that there was only the one . What did you see ? " All three men started to talk at once , a clamor of noise ; then all stopped at once . " You first , Spud . Whom did you talk to , and what did he , she , or it say ? " Although Conway Costigan was a few years older than the other three , they all called him by nicknameas a matter of course . " National Police Headquarters  --  Chief of the Detective Bureau , " Costigan reported , crisply . " Between forty three and forty five ; six feet and half an inch ; one seventy five . Hard , fine , keen , a Big Time Operator if there ever was one . Looked a lot like your father , Jill ; the same dark auburn hair , just beginning to gray , and the same deep orange-yellow markings in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lens out of his safe , snapped it onto my wrist , and gave me two orders -- get out and stay out . " Jack and Mase stared at Costigan , at Jill , and at each other . Then they whistled in unison . " I see this is not going to be a unanimous report , exceptpossibly in one minor detail , " Jill remarked . " Mase , you 're next . " " I landed on the campus of the University of Arisia , " Northrop stated , flatly . " Immense place  --  hundreds of thousands of students . They took me to the Physics Department  --  to the private laboratory of the Department Head himself . He had a panel with about a million meters and gauges on it ; he scanned and measured every individual component elementof my brain . Then he made a pattern , on a milling router just about as complicated as his panel . From there on , of course , it was simple -- just like a dentist making a set of china choppers or a metallurgist embedding a test-section . He snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said ' Scram ! ' That 's all . " " Sure that was all ? " Costigan asked . " Did n't he add and stay scrammed ' ? " " He did n't say it , exactly , but the implication was clear enough . " " The one point of similarity , " Jill commented . " Now you , Jack . You have been looking as though we were all candidates for canvas jackets that lace tightly up the back . " " Uh-uh . As though maybe I am . I did n't see anything at all . Did n't even land on the planet . Just floated around in an orbit inside that screen . The thing I talked with was a pattern of pure force . This Lens simply appeared on my wrist , bracelet and all , out of thin air . He told me plenty , though , in a very short time  --  his last word being for me not to come back or call back . " " Hm . . . m . . . m . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for Jill Samms . " In plain words , " Costigan volunteered , " we all saw exactly what we expected to see . " " Uh-uh , " Jill denied . " I certainly did not expect to see a woman . . . no ; what each of us saw , I think , was what would do us the most good  --  give each of us the highest possible lift . I am wondering whether or not there was anything at all really there . " " That might be it , at that . " Jack scowled in concentra-42 FIRST LENSMANtion . " But there must have been something there  --  these Lenses are real : But what makes me mad is that they would n't give you a Lens . You 're just as good a man as any one of us  --  if I did n't know it would n't do a damn bit of good I 'd go back there right now and ... " " Do n't pop off so , Jack ! " Jill 's eyes , however , were starry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost love you , at times  --  but I do n't need a Lens . As a matter of fact , I 'll be much better off without one . " " Jet back , Jill ! " Jack Kinnison stared deeply into the girl 's eyes  --  but still did not use his Lens . " Somebody must have done a terrific job of selling , to make you believe that ... or are you sold , actually ? " " Actually . Honestly . That Arisian was a thousand times more of a woman than I ever will be , and she did n't wear a Lens  --  never had worn one . Women 's minds and Lenses do n't - fit . There 's a sex-based incompatibility . Lenses are as masculine as whiskers  --  and at that , only a very few men can ever wear them , either . Very special men , like you three and Dad and Pops Kinnison . Men with tremendous force , drive , and scope . Pure killers , all of you ; each in his own way , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twice as hard and ten times as cold . A woman simply ca n't have that kind of a mind ! There is going to be a woman Lensman some day  --  just one  --  but not for years and years ; and I would n't be in her shoes for anything . In this job of mine , of . . . " " Well , go on . What is this job you 're so sure you are going to do ? " " Why , I do n't know ! " Jill exclaimed , startled eyes wide . " I thought I knew all about it , but I do n't ! Do you , about yours ? " They did not , not one of them ; and they were all as surprised at that fact as the girl had been . " Well , to get back to this Lady Lensman who is going to appear some day , I gather that she is going to be some kind of a freak . She 'll have to be , practically , because of the sex-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , in so many words , but she made it perfectly clear that ... " " Mentor ! " the three men exclaimed . Each of them had dealt with Mentor ! " I am beginning to see , " Jill said , thoughtfully . " Mentor . Not a real name at all . To quote the Unabridged verbatim  --  I had occasion to look the word up the other day and I am appalled now at the certainty that there was a connection  --  quote ; Mentor , a wise and faithful counselor ; unquote . Have any of you boys anything to say ? I have n't ; and I am beginning to be scared blue . " Silence fell ; and the more they thought , those three young Lensmen and the girl who was one of the two human women ever to encounter knowingly an Arisian mind , the deeper that silence became. 0 YOU DID N'T FIND ANYTHINGon Nevia . " Roderick Kinnison got up , deposited the inchlongbutt of his cigar in an ashtray , lit another , and prowled about the room ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . Nerado struck me as being a B.T.O. . . . I thought sure he 'd qualify . " " So did I. " Samms ' tone was glum . " He 's Big Time , and an Operator ; but not big enough , by far . I 'm  --  we 're both  --  finding out that Lensman material is damned scarce stuff . There 's none on Nevia , and no indication whatever that there ever will be any . " " Tough . . . and you 're right , of course , in your stand that we 'll have to have Lensmen from as many different solar systems as possible on the Galactic Council or the thing wo n't work at all . So damned much jealousy  --  which is one reason why we 're here in New York instead of out at the Hill , where we belong  --  we 've found that out already , even in such a small and comparatively homogeneous group as our own system  --  the Solarian Council will not only have to be made up mostly of Lensmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be represented -- even Pluto , I suppose , in time . And by the way , your Mr. Saunders was n't any too pleased when you took Knobos of Mars and DalNalten ofBRIBERY 45Venus away from him and made Lensmen out of them  --  and put them miles over his head . " " Oh , I would n't say that . . . exactly . I convinced him ... but at that , since Saunders is not Lensman grade himself , it was a trifle difficult for him to understand the situation completely . " " You say it easy  --  ' difficult ' is not the word I would use . But back to the Lensman hunt . " Kinnison scowled blackly . " I agree , as I said before , that we need non-human Lensmen , the more the better , but I do n't think much of your chance of finding any . What makes you think . . . Oh , I see .. . but I do n't know whether you 're justified or not in assuming a high positive correlation between a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No such assumption is necessary . Start anywhere you please , Rod , and take it from there ; including Nevia . " " I 'll start with known facts , then . Interstellar flight is new to us . We have n't spread far , or surveyed much territory . But in the eight solar systems with which we are most familiar there are seven planets  --  I 'm not counting Valeriawhichare very much like Earth in point of mass , size , climate , atmosphere , and gravity . Five of the seven did not have any intelligent life and were colonized easily and quickly . The Tellurian worlds of Procyon and Vega became friendly neighbors  --  thank God we learned something on Nevia -- because they were already inhabited by highly advancedraces : Procia by people as human as we are , Vegia by people who would be so if it were n't for their tails . Many other worlds of these systems are inhabited by more or less intelligent non-human races . Just how intelligent they are we do n't know , but the Lensmen will soon find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found so far has had either atomic energy or any form of space-drive . In any contact with races having space-drives we have not been the discoverers , but the discovered . Our colonies are all within twenty six light-years of Earth except Aldebaran II , which is fifty seven , but which drew a lot of people , in spite of the distance , because it was so nearly identical with Earth. 46 FIRST LENSMANOn the other hand , the Nevians , from a distance of over a hundred light-years , found us . . . implying an older race and a higher development . . . but you just told me that they would never produce a Lensman ! " " That point stopped me , too , at first . Follow through ; I want to see if you arrive at the same conclusion I did . " " Wei . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . " Kinnison thought intensely , then went on : " Of course , the Nevians were not colonizing ; nor , strictly speaking , exploring . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensively specialized operation to find a raw material they needed desperately . " " Precisely , " Samms agreed . " The Rigellians , however , were surveying , and Rigel is about four hundred and forty light-years from here . We did n't have a thing they needed or wanted . They nodded at us in passing and kept on going . I 'm still on your track ? " " Dead center . And just where does that put the Palainians ? " " I see . . . you may have something there , at that . Palain is so far away that nobody knows even where it is  --  probablythousands of light-years . Yet they have not only exploredthis system ; they colonized Pluto long before our white race colonized America . But damn it , Virge , I do n't like it  --  any part of it . Rigel Four you may be able to take , with your Lens . . . even one of their damned automobiles , if you stay solidly en rapport with the driver . But Palain , Virge ! Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . Nobody can . It simply ca n't be done ! " " I know it wo n't be easy , " Samms admitted , bleakly , " but if it 's got to be done , I 'll do it . And I have a little information that I have n't had time to tell you yet . We discussedonce before , you remember , what a job it was to get into any kind of communication with the Palainians on Pluto . You said then that nobody could understand them , and you were right  --  then . However , I re-ran those brain-wave tapes , wearing my Lens , and could understand them  --  the thoughts , that is  --  as well as though they had been recorded in **25;5279;TOOLONG . " BRIBERY 47 " What ? " Kinnison exclaimed , then fell silent . Samms remained silent . What they were thinking of Arisia 's Lens can not be expressed in words . " Well , go on , " Kinnison finally said . " Give me the rest of it  --  the stinger that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as messages  --  were clear and plain . The backgrounds , however , the connotations and implications , were not . Some of their codes and standards seem to be radically different from ours  --  so utterly and fantastically different that I simply can not reconcile either their conduct or their ethics with their obviously high intelligence and their advanced state of development . However , they have at least some minds of tremendous power , and none of the peculiaritiesI deduced were of such a nature as to preclude Lensmanship . Therefore I am going to Pluto ; and from there  --  I hope  --  to Palain Seven . If there 's a Lensman there , I 'll get him . " " You will , at that , " Kinnison paid quiet tribute to what he , better than anyone else , knew that his friend had . " But enough of me  --  how are you doing ? " " As well as can be expected at this stage of the game . The thing is developing along three main lines . First , the pirates . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line I 'm handling it myself , unless and until you find someonebetter qualified . I 've got Jack and Costigan working on it now . " Second ; drugs , vice , and so on . I hope you find somebody to take this line over , because , frankly , I 'm in over my depth and want to get out . Knobos and DalNalten are trying to find out if there 's anything to the idea that there may be a planetary , or even inter-planetary , ring involved . Since Sid Fletcher is n't a Lensman I could n't disconnect him openly from his job , but he knows a lot about the dope-vice situation and is working practically full time with the other two . " Third ; pure  --  or rather , decidedly impure  --  politics . The more I studied that subject , the clearer it became that politics would be the worst and biggest battle of the three. 48 FIRST LENSMAN BRIBERY 49There are too many angles I do n't know a damned thing about , such as what to do about the succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be throwing the minute he finds out what our Galactic Patrol is going to do . So I ducked the whole political line . " Now you know as well as T do  --  better , probably  --  that Morgan is only the Pernicious Activities Committee of the North American Senate . Multiply him by the thousands of others , all over space , who will be on our necks before the Patrol can get its space-legs , and you will see that all that stuff will have to be handled by a Lensman who , as well as being a mighty smooth operator , will have to know all the answers and will have to have plenty of guts . I 've got the guts , but none of the other prime requisites . Jill has n't , although she 's got everything else . Fairchild , your Relations ace , is n't a Lensman and can never become one . So you can see quite plainly who has got to handle politics himself . " " You may be right . . . but this Lensman business comes first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhapsprobably  --  Ican find somebody on this trip  --  a Palainian , say  --  who is better qualified than any of us . " Kinnison snorted . " If you can , I 'll buy you a week in any Venerian relaxerie you want to name . " " Better start saving up your credits , then , because from what I already know of the Palainian mentality such a development is distinctly more than a possibility . " Samms paused , his eyes narrowing . " I do n't know whether it would make Morgan and his kind more rabid or less so to have a non-Solarian entity possess authority in our affairs political  --  but at least it would be something new and different . But in spite of what you said about ducking ' politics , what have you got Northrop , Jill and Fairchild doing ? " " Well , we had a couple of discussions . I could n't give either Jill or Dick orders , of course ... " " Would n't , you mean , " Samms corrected . " Could n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and Lensman grade , has no official connection with either the Triplanetary Service or the Solarian Patrol . Andthe Service , including Fairchild , is still Triplanetary ; and it will have to stay Triplanetary until you have found enough Lensmen so that you can spring your twin surprises  --  Galactic Council and Galactic Patrol . However , Northrop and Fairchild are keeping their eyes and ears open and their mouths shut , and Jill is finding out whatever she can about drugs and so on , as well as the various political angles . They 'll report to you  --  facts , deductions , guesses , and recommendations  --  whenever you say the word . " " Nice work , Rod . Thanks . I think I 'll call Jill now , before I go  --  wonder where she is ? . . . but I wonder . . . with the Lens perhaps telephones are superflous ? I 'll try it . " " JILL ! " he thought intensely into his Lens , forming as he did so a mental image of his gorgeous daughter as he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that neither elaboration nor emphasis was necessary . " Ouch ! " came almost instantaneous answer , long before his thought was complete . " Do n't think so hard , Dad , it hurts  --  I almost missed a step . " Virgilia was actually there with him ; inside his own mind ; in closer touch with him than she had ever before been . " Back so soon ? Shall we report now , or are n't you ready to go to work yet ? " " Skipping for the moment your aspersions on my presentactivities  --  not quite . " Samms moderated the intensity of his thought to a conversational level . " Just wanted to check with you . Come in , Rod . " In flashing thoughts he brought her up to date . " Jill , do you agree with what Rod here has just told me ? " " Yes . Fully . So do the boys . " " That settles it , then  --  unless , of course , I can find a more capable substitute . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Where are you and what are you doing ? " " Washington , D. C. European Embassy . Dancing with Herkimer Herkimer Third , Senator Morgan 's Number One secretary . I was going to make passes at him  --  in a perfectly lady-like way , of course  --  but it was n't necessary . He thinks he can break down my resistance . " 50 FIRST LENSMAN BRIBERY 51 " Careful , Jill ! That kind of stuff ... " " Is very old stuff indeed , Daddy dear . Simple . And Herkimer Herkimer Third is n't really a menace ; he just thinks he is . Take a look  --  you can , ca n't you , with your Lens ? " " Perhaps . . . Oh , yes . I see him as well as you do .

" " That 's because you are n't a girl . " Jill giggled mentally . " This is fun ; and it wo n't hurt him a bit , except maybe for a slightly bruised vanity , when I do n't fall down flat at his feet . And I 'm learning a lot that he has n't any suspicion he 's giving away . " " Knowing you , I believe that . But do n't . . . that is .. . well , be very careful not to get your fingers burned . The job is n't worth it  --  yet . " " Do n't worry , Dad . " She laughed unaffectedly . " When it comes to playboys like this one , I 've got millions and skill ions and whillions of ohms of resistance . But here comes Senator Morgan himself , with a fat and repulsive Venerianhe'scalling my boy-friend away from me , with what he thinks is an imperceptible high-sign , into a huddle  --  and my olfactory nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skunk  --  so . . . I hate to seem to be giving a Solarian Councillorthe heave-ho , but if I want to read what goes on  --  and I certainly do  --  I ' 11 have to concentrate . As soon as you get back give us a call and we 'll report . Take it easy , Dad ! " " You 're the one to be told that , not me . Good hunting , Jill ! " Samms , still seated calmly at his desk , reached out and pressed a button marked " GARAGE " . His office was on the seventieth floor ; the garage occupied level after level of sub-basement . The screen brightened ; a keen young face appeared . " Good evening , Jim . Will you please send my car up to the Wright Skyway feeder ? " " At once , sir . It will be there in seventy five seconds . " Samms cut off ; and , after a brief exchange of thought with Kinnison , went out into the hall and along it to the " DOWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a doorless , unguarded archway into over a thousand feet of air . Although it was long after conventional office hours the shaft was still fairly busy , but that made no **31;5306;TOOLONG can not even be felt . He bulleted downwardto the sixth floor , where he brought himself to an instantaneoushalt . Leaving the shaft , he joined the now thinning crowd hurrying toward the exit . A girl with meticulously plucked eyebrows and an astounding hair-do , catching sight of his Lens , took her hands out of her breeches pockets  --  skirts went out , as office dress , when up-and-down open-shaft velocities of a hundred or so miles per hour replaced elevators  --  nudgedher companion , and whispered excitedly : " Look there ! Quick ! I never saw one close up before , did you ? That 's him  --  himself ! First Lensman Samms ! " At th4 Portal , the Lensman as a matter of habit held out his car-check , but such formalities were no longer necessary , or even possible . Everybody knew , or wanted to be thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , First Lensman , sir , " the uniformed gateman told him , without even glancing at the extended disk . " Thank you , Tom . " " This way , please , sir , First Lensman , " and a youth , teeth gleaming white in a startlingly black face , strodeproudly to the indicated stall and opened the vehicle 's door . " Thank you , Danny , " Samms said , as appreciatively asthough he did not know exactly where his ground-car was . He got in . The door jammed itself gently shut . Therunabout  --  a Dillingham eleven-forty  --  shot smoothly forwardupon its two fat , soft tires . Half-way to the exit archwayhe was doing forty ; he hit the steeply-banked curve52 FIRST LENSMANleading into the lofty " street " at ninety . Nor was there shock or strain . Motorcycle-wise , but automatically , the " Dilly " leaned against its gyroscopes at precisely the correct angle ; the huge low-pressure tires clung to the resilient synthetic of the pavement as though integral with it . Nor was there any question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above Varick street proper , was not , strictly speaking , a street at all . It had only one point of access , the one which Samms had used ; and only one exit  --  it was simply and only a feeder into Wright Skyway , a **25;5339;TOOLONG . Samms saw , without noting particularly , the maze of traffic-ways of which this feeder was only one tiny part ; a maze which extended from ground-level up to a point well above even the towering buildings of New York 's metropolitandistrict . The way rose sharply ; Samms ' right foot went down a little farther ; the Dillingham began to pick up speed . Movingloud-speakers sang to him and yelled and blared at him , but he did not hear them . Brilliant signs , flashing and flaring all the colors of the spectrum  --  sheer triumphs of the electrician 's art  --  blazed in or flamed into arresting words and eye-catching pictures , but he did not see them . Advertising  --  advertisingdesigned by experts to sell everything from aard-varks to Martian zyzmol ( " bottled ecstacy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dweller . His mind had long since become a perfect filter , admitting to his consciousness only things which he wanted to perceive : only so can big-city life be made endurable . Approaching the Skyway , he cut in his touring roadlights , slowed down a trifle , and insinuated his low-flyer into the stream of traffic . Those lights threw fifteen hundred watts apiece , but there was no glare  --  polarized lenses and windshields saw to that . He wormed his way over to the left-hand , high-speed lane and opened up . At the edge of the skyscraper district , where Wright Skyway angles sharply downward to ground level , Samms ' attention was caught and held by somethingBRIBERY 53off to his right  --  a blue-white , whistling something that hurtled upward into the air . As it ascended it slowed down ; its monotone shriek became lower and lower in pitch ; its light went down through the spectrum toward the red . Finallyit exploded , with an earth-shaking crash ; but the lightning-likeflash of the detonation , instead of vanishing almost instantaneously , settled itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four words  --  two bearded faces and " SMITH BROS . COUGH DROPS " ! " Well , I 'll be damned ! " Samms spoke aloud , chagrined at having been compelled to listen to and to look at an advertisement . " I thought I had seen everything , but that is really new ! " Twenty minutes  --  fifty miles  --  later , Samms left the Skyway at a point near what had once been South Norwalk , Connecticut ; an area transformed now into the level square miles of New York Spaceport . New York Spaceport ; then , and until the establishment of Prime Base , the biggest and busiest field in existence upon any planet of Civilization . For New York City , long the financial and commercial capital of the Earth , had maintained the same dominant position in the affairs of the Solar Systemand was holding a substantial lead over her rivals , Chicago , London , and Stalingrad , in the race for interstellar supremacy . And Virgil Samms himself , because of the ever-increasingmenace of piracy , had been largely responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrol upon each space-field in direct ratio to the size and importanceof that field . Hence he was no stranger in New York Spaceport ; in fact , master psychologist that he was , he had made it a point to know by first name practically everyone connected with it . No sooner had he turned his Dillingham over to a smilingattendant , however , than he was accosted by a man whom he had never seen before . " Mr. Samms ? " the stranger asked . " Yes . " Samms did not energize his Lens ; he had not54 FIRST LENSMAN BRIBERY 55yet developed either the inclination cr the technique to probe instantaneously every entity who approached him , upon any pretext whatever , in order to find out what that entity really wanted . " I 'm Isaacson . . . " the man paused , as though he had supplied a world of information . " Yes ? " Samms was receptive , but not impressed . " Interstellar Spaceways , you know . We 've been trying to see you for two weeks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to buttonhole you here , myself . But we 're just as much alone here as we would be in either one of our offices  --  yes , more so .

Surely you know that I no longer have even a portfolio in the Council ; that practicallyall of my attention is , and for some time to come will be , directed elsewhere ? " " Exactly  --  officially . " Isaacson 's tone spoke volumes . " But you 're still the Boss ; they 'll do anything you tell them to . We could n't try to do business with you before , of course , but in your present position there is nothing whatever to prevent you from getting into the biggest thing that will ever be .

" " I 'm still not interested . " " No . . . o . . . o ... ? " Isaacson studied the Lensman narrowly : and Samms , Lens now wide awake , studied the enterpreneur . " Wei . . . 1 . . . while I admit that we want you pretty badly , you are smart enough to know that we'llget what we want anyway , with or without you .

That 's my high bid ; that 's as high as we can possibly go . " " I 'm glad to hear that  --  I 'm still not interested , " and Samms strode away , calling his friend Kinnison as he did so . " Rod ? Virgil . " He told the story . " Whew ! " Kinnison whistled expressively . " They 're not pikers , anyway , are they ? What a sweet set-up  --  and you could wrap it up and hand it to them like a pound of coffee ... " " Or you could , Rod . " " Could be . . . " The big Lensman ruminated . " But what a hookup ! Perfectly legitimate , and with plenty of precedents  --  andarguments , of a sort  --  in its favor . The outer planets . Then Alpha Centauri and Sirius and Procyon and so on .

" " And still longer for it to be believed . " " Right . But as to the chance of Interstellar Spaceways ever getting the monopoly they 're working for , I did n't think I would have to remind you that it was not entirely by accidentthat over half of the members of the Solarian Council are Lensmen , and that any Galactic Councillor will auto-56 FIRST LENSMAN BRIBERY 57matically have to be a Lensman . So go right ahead with what you started , my boy , and do n't give Isaacson and Companyanother thought . We 'll bend an optic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was overlooking a few things , at that , I guess . " Samms sighed in relief as he entered the main office of the Patrol . The line at the rece'ptionist 's desk was fairly short , but even so , Samms was not allowed to wait . That highly decorative , but far-from-dumb blonde , breaking off in midsentenceher business of the moment , turned on her charm as though it had been a battery of floodlights , pressed a stud on her desk , and spoke to the man before her and to the Lensman : " Excuse me a moment , please . First Lensman Samms , sir ... ? " " Yes , Miss Regan ? " her communicator  --  " squawk-box " , in every day parlance  --  broke in . " First Lensman Samms is here , sir , " the girl announced , and broke the circuit . " Good evening , Sylvia . Lieutenant-Commander Wagner , please , or whoever else is handling clearances , " Samms answered what he thought was to have been her question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore Clayton has been waiting for you . . . here he is , now . " " Hi , Virgil ! " Commodore Clayton , a big , solid man with a scarred face and a shock of iron-gray hair , whose collar bore the two silver stars which proclaimed him to be the commander-in-chief of a continental contingent of the Patrol , shook hands vigorously . " I 'll zip you out . Miss Regan , call a bug , please . " " Oh , that is n't necessary , Alex ! " Samms protested . " I 'll pick one up outside . " " Not in any Patrol base in North America , my friend ; nor , unless I am very badly mistaken , anywhere else . From now on , Lensmen have absolute priority , and the quicker everybody realizes exactly what that means , the better . " The " bug "  --  a vehicle something like a jeep , except moreso  --  was waiting at the door . The two men jumped aboard . " The Chicago  --  and blast ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gravel flew from beneath skidding tires as the highly maneuverable little ground-car took off . A screaming turn into the deservedly famous Avenueof Oaks . Along the Avenue . Through the Gate , the guards saluting smartly as the bug raced past them . Past the barracks . Past the airport hangars and strips . Out into the space-field , the scarred and blackened area devoted solely to the widely-spaced docks of the tremendous vessels which plied the vacuous reaches of interplanetary and interstellarspace . Space-docks were , and are , huge and sprawling structures ; built of concrete and steel and asbestos and ultrastubbornrefractory and insulation and vacuum-breaks ; fully air-conditioned and having refrigeration equipment of thousands of tons per hour of ice ; designed not only to expedite servicing , unloading , and loading , but also to protect material and personnel from the raving , searing blasts of take-off and of landing . A space-dock is a squat and monstrous cylinder , into whose hollow top the lowermost one-third of a space-ship 's bulk fits as snugly as does a baseball into the " pocket " of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between those docks minimize the apparent size , both of the structures themselves and of the vessels surmountingthem . Thus , from a distance , the Chicago looked little enough , and harmless enough ; but as the bug flashed under the overhanging bulk and the driver braked savagely to a stop at one of the dock 's entrances , Samms could scarcely keep from flinching . That featureless , gray , smoothly curving wall of alloy steel loomed so incredibly high above them  --  extended so terrifyingly far outward beyond its visible means of support ! It must be on the very verge of crashing ! Samms stared deliberately at the mass of metal towering above him , then smiled  --  not without effort  --  at his companion . " You 'd think , Alex , that a man would get over being58 FIRST LENSMAN BRIBERY 59afraid that a ship was going to fall on him , but I have n't  --  yet . " " No , and you probably never will . I never have , and I 'm one of the old hands . Some claim not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie detector . That 's why they had to make the passenger docks bigger than the liners  --  too many passengersfainted and had to be carried aboard on stretchers  --  or cancelled passage entirely . However , scaring hell out of them on the ground had one big advantage ; they felt so safe inside that they did n't get the colly-wobbles so bad when they went free . " " Well , I 've got over that , anyway . Good-bye , Alex ; and thanks . " Samms entered the dock , shot smoothly upward , followedan escorting officer to the captain 's own cabin , and settled himself into a cushioned chair facing an ultra-wave viewplate . A face appeared upon his communicator screen and spoke . " Winfield to First Lensman Samms  --  you will be ready to blast off at twenty one hundred ? " " Samms to Captain Winfield , " the Lensman replied . " I will be ready . " Sirens yelled briefly ; a noise which Samms knew was purely a formality . Clearance had been issued ; Station PINNY was filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Chicago 's dock to be affected by the blast were under cover and safe . The blast went on ; the plate showed , instead of a view of the space-field , a blaze of blue-white light . The warship was inertialess , it is true ; but so terrific were the forces released that incandescent gases , furiously driven , washed the dock and everything for hundreds of yards around it . The plate cleared . Through the lower , denser layers of atmosphere the Chicago bored in seconds ; then , as the air grew thinner and thinner , she rushed upward faster and faster . The terrain below became concave . . . then convex . Being completely without inertia , the ship 's velocity was at every instant that at which the friction of the mediumthrough which she blasted her way equaled precisely the force of her driving thrust . Wherefore , out in open space , the Earth a fast-shrinking tiny ball and Sol himself growing smaller , paler , and weaker at a startling rate , the Chicago 's speed attained an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to grasp . CHAPTER5Rigel FourOR HOURS VIRGIL SAMMS SATmotionless , staring almost unseeing into his plate . It was not that the view was not worth seeing  --  the wonder of space , the ever-changing , constantly-shifting panorama of incredibly brilliant although dimensionless points of light , against that wondrous background of mist-besprinkled black velvet , is a thing that never fails to awe even the most seasoned observer  --  buthe had a tremendous load on his mind . He had to solve an apparently insoluble problem . How . . . how .. . HOW could he do what he had to do ? Finally , knowing that the time of landing was approaching , he got up , unfolded his fans , and swam lightly through the air of the cabin to a hand-line , along which he drew himself into the control room . He could have made the trip in that room , of course , if he had so chosen ; but , knowing that officers of space do not really like to have strangers ' in that sanctum , he did not intrude until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his master conning plate . Pilots , navigators , and computers worked busily at their respective tasks . " I was just going to call you , First Lensman . " Winfield waved a hand in the general direction of a chair near his own . " Take the Lieutenant-Captain 's station , please . " Then , RIGEL FOUR 61after a few minutes : " Go inert , Mr. White . " " Attention , all personnel , " Lieutenant-Captain White spoke conversationally into a microphone . " Prepare for inert maneuvering , Class Three . Off . " A bank of tiny red lights upon a panel turned green practically as one . White cut the Bergenholm , whereupon Virgil Samms ' mass changed instantly from a weight of zero to one of five hundred and twenty five pounds  --  ships of war then had no space to waste upon such non-essentials as artificialgravity . Although he was braced for the change and cushioned against it , the Lensman 's breath whooshed ! out sharply ; but , being intensely interested in what was going on , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breaths , and fought his way back up to normalcy . The Chief Pilot was now at work , with all the virtuoso 's skill of his rank and grade ; one of the hall-marks of which is to make difficult tasks look easy . He played trills and runs and arpeggios  --  at times veritable glissades  --  upon keyboardsand pedals , directing with micrometric precision the tremendous forces of the superdreadnaught to the task of matching the intrinsic velocity of New York Spaceport at the time of his departure to the I. V. of the surface of the planet so far below . Samms stared into his plate ; first at the incredibly tiny apparent size of that incredibly hot sun , and , then at the barren-looking world toward which they were dropping at such terrific speed . " It does n't seem possible . . . " he remarked , half to Winfield , half to himself , " that a sun could be that big and that hot . Rigel Four is almost two hundred times as far away from it as Earth is from Sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look much , if any , bigger than Venus does from Luna  --  yet this world is hotter than the Sahara Desert . " " Well , blue giants are both big and hot , " the captain replied , matter-of-factly , " and their radiation , being mostly invisible , is deadly stuff . And Rigel is about the biggest in this region . There are others a lot worse , though . Doradus62 FIRST LENSMAN RIGEL FOUR 63S , for instance , would make Rigel , here , look like a tallow candle . I 'm going out there , some of these days , just to take a look at it . But that 's enough of astronomical chit-chat  --  we 're down to twenty miles of altitude and we 've got your city just about stopped . " The Chicago slowed gently to a halt ; perched motionlessupon softly hissing jets . Samms directed his visibeam downward and sent along it an exploring , questing thought . Since he had never met a Rigellian in person , he could not form the mental image or pattern necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . He did know , however , the type of mind which must be possessed by the entity with whom he wished to talk , and he combed the Rigellian city until he found one . The rapport was so incompleteand imperfect as to amount almost to no contact at all , but he could , perhaps , make himself understood . " If you will excuse this possibly unpleasant and certainlyunwarranted intrusion , " he thought , carefully and slowly , " I would like very much to discuss with you a matter which should become of paramount importance to all the intelligent peoples of all the planets in space . " " I welcome you , Tellurian . " Mind fused yvith mind at every one of uncountable millions of points and paths . This Rigellian professor of sociology , standing at his desk , was physically a monster . . . the oil-drum of a body , the four blocky legs , the multi-branchiate tentacular arms , that immobiledome of a head , the complete lack of eyes and of ears ... nevertheless Samms ' mind fused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost as completely as it had with his own daughter 's ! And what a mind ! The transcendent poise ; the staggeringlytremendous range and scope  --  the untroubled and unshakeablecalm ; the sublime quietude ; the vast and placid certainty ; the ultimate stability , unknown and forever unknowableto any human or near-human race ! " Dismiss all thought of intrusion , First Lensman Samms ... I have heard of you human beings , of course , but have never considered seriously the possibility of meeting one ofyou mind to mind . Indeed , it was reported that none of our minds could make any except the barest and most unsatisfactorycontact with any of yours they chanced to encounter . It is , I now perceive , the Lens which makes this full accord possible , and it is basically about the Lens that you are here ? " " It is , " and Samms went on to cover in flashing thoughts his conception of what the Galactic Patrol should be and should become . That was easy enough ; but when he tried to describe in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " Force , drive , scope , of course . . . range . . . power . . . but above all , an absolute integrity . . . an ultimate incorruptibility . . " He could recognize such a mind after meeting it and studying it , but as to finding it . . . It might not be in any place of power or authority . His own , and Rod Kinnison 's , happened to be ; but Costigan 's was not . . . and both Knobos and DalNalten had made inconspicuousness a fine art .. . " I see , " the native stated , when it became clear that Samms could say no more . " It is evident , of course , that I can not qualify ; nor do I know anyone personally who can . However ... " " What ? " Samms demanded . " I was sure , from the feel of your mind , that you . . . but with a mind of such depth and breadth , such tremendous scope and power , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the dry rejoinder . " We all are . No Rigellianis , or ever will be or can be , what you think of as ' corrupt ' or corruptible ' . Indeed , it is only by the narrowest , most intense concentration upon every line of your thought that I can translate your meaning into a concept possible for any of us even to understand . " " Then what ... Oh , I see . I was starting at the wrong end . Naturally enough , I suppose , I looked first for the qualitiesrarest in my own race . " " Of course . Our minds have ample scope and range ; and , perhaps , sufficient power . But those qualities which you refer to as force ' and drive ' are fully as rare among us64 FIRST LENSMAN RIGEL FOUR 65as absolute mental integrity is among you . What ' you know as crime ' is unknown . We have no police , no government , no laws , no organized armed forces of any kind . We take , practically always , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as your thought runs . We work together for the common good . " " Well . . . I do n't know what I expected to find here , but certainly not this .. : " If Samms had never before been completely thunderstruck , completely at a loss , he was then . " You do n't think , then , that there is any chance ? " " I have been thinking , and there may be a chance .. . a slight one , but still a chance , " the Rigellian said , slowly . " For instance , that youth , so full of curiosity , who first visited your planet . Thousands of us have wondered , to ourselvesand to each other , about the peculiar qualities of mind which compelled him and others to waste so much time , effort , and wealth upon a project so completely useless as exploration . Why , he had even to develop energies and enginestheretofore unknown , and which can never be of any real use ! " Samms was shaken by the calm finality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interstellarexploration , but stuck doggedly to his purpose . " However slight the chance , I must find and talk to this man . I suppose he is now out in deep space somewhere . Have you any idea where ? " " He is now in his home city , accumulating funds and manufacturing fuel with which to continue his pointless activities . That city is named . . . that is , in your English you might call it . . . Suntown ? Sunberg ? No , it must be more specific . . . Rigelsville ? Rigel City ? " " Rigelston , I would translate it ? " Samms hazarded . " Exactly  --  Rigelston . " The professor marked its locationupon a globular mental map far more accurate and far more detailed than the globe which Captain Winfield and his lieutenant were then studying . " Thanks . Now , can you and will you get in touch with this explorer and ask him to call a meeting of his full crewand any others who might be interested in the project I have outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his kind are not quite sane , of course , as you know ; but I do not believe that even they are so insane as to be willing to subject themselves to the environment of your vessel . " " They will not be asked to come here . The meeting will be held in Rigelston . If necessary , I shall insist that it be held there . " " You would ? I perceive that you would . It is strange . yes , fantastic . . . you are quarrelsome , pugnacious , antisocial , vicious , small-bodied and small-brained ; timid , nervous , and highly and senselessly excitable ; unbalanced and unsane ; as sheerly monstrous mentally as you are physically ... " These outrageous thoughts were sent as casually and as impersonally as though the sender were discussing the weather . He paused , then went on : " And yet , to further such a completely visionary project , you are eager to subject yourself to conditions whose counterparts I could not force myself , under any circumstances whatever , to meet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is an extension of the principle of working together for the common good which my mind , for lack of pertinent data , has not been able to grasp . I am now en rapport with Dronvire the explorer . " " Ask him , please , not to identify himself to me . I do not want to go into that meeting with any preconceived ideas . " " A balanced thought , " the Rigellian approved . " Someonewill be at the airport to point out to you the already desolated area in which the space-ship of the explorers makes its so-frightful landings ; Dronvire will ask someone to meet you at the airport and bring you to the place of meeting . " The telepathic line snapped and Samms turned a white and sweating face to the Chicago 's captain . " God , what a strain ! Do n't ever ti y telepathy unless you positively have to  --  especially not with such an outlandishlydifferent race as these Rigellians are ! " 66 FIRST LENSMAN RIGEL FOUR 67 " Do n't worry ; I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his tone was . " You looked as though somebody was beating your brains out with a spiked club . Where next , First Lensman ? " Samms marked the location of Rigelston upon the vessel'schart , then donned ear-plugs and a special , radiationproofsuit of armor , equipped with refrigerators and with extra-thick blocks of lead glass to protect the eyes . The airport , an extremely busy one well outside the city proper , was located easily enough , as was the spot upon which the Tellurian ship was to land . Lightly , slowly , she settled downward , her jets raving out against a gravity fully twice that of her native Earth . Those blasts , however , added little or nothing to the destruction already accomplished by the craft then lying there  --  a torpedo-shaped cruiser having perhaps one-twentieth of the Chicago 's mass and bulk . The superdreadnaught landed , sinking into the hard , dry ground to a depth of some ten or fifteen feet before she stopped . Samms , en rapport with the entity who was to be his escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with his own . No use . This one was not and never could become Lensman material . He climbed heavily down the ladder . This double-normal gravity made the going a bit difficult , but he could stand that a lot better than some of the other things he was going to have to take . The Rigellian equivalent of an automobile was there , waiting for him , its door invitingly open . Samms had known  --  in general-what to expect . The two-wheeled chassis was more or less similar to that of his own Dillingham . The body was a narrow torpedo of steel , bluntly pointed at both ends , and without windows . Two features , however , were both unexpected and unpleasant  --  the hard , tough steel of which that body was forged was an inch and a half thick , instead of one-sixteenth ; and even that extraordinarily armored body was dented and scarred and marred , especially about the fore and rear quarters , as deeply and as badly and as casually as are the fenders of an Earthly jalopy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grimly forbidding black interior . Black ? It was so black that the port-hole-like doorway seemed to admit no light at all . It was blacker than a witch 's cat in a coal cellar at midnight ! Samms flinched ; then , stiffening , thought at the driver . " My contact with you seems to have slipped . I 'm afraid that I will have to cling to you rather more tightly than may be either polite or comfortable . Deprived of sight , and withoutyour sense of perception , I am practically helpless . " " Come in , Lensman , by all means . I offered to maintain full engagement , but it seemed to me that you declined it ; quite possibly the misunderstanding was due to our unfamiliaritywith each others ' customary mode of thought . Relax , please , and come in . . . there ! Better ? " " Infinitely better . Thanks . " And it was . The darkness vanished ; through the unexplainableperceptive sense of the Rigellian he could " see " everything  --  he had a practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see both the inside and the outside of the ground car he was in and of the immense space-ship in which he had come to Rigel IV . He could see the bearings and the wrist-pins of the internalcombustionengine of the car , the interior structure of the welds that held the steel plates together , the busy airport outside , and even deep into the ground . He could see and study in detail the deepest-buried , most heavily shielded parts of the atomic engines of the Chicago . But he was wasting time . He could also plainly see a deeply-cushioned chair , designed to fit a human body , welded to a stanchion and equipped with half a dozen padded restrainingstraps . He sat down quickly ;  --  strapped himself in . " Ready ? " " Ready . " The door banged shut with a clangor which burst through space-suit and ear-plugs with all the violence of a nearby thunderclap . And that was merely the beginning . The engine started  --  an internal-combustion engine of wellover a thousand horsepower , designed for maximum eiciencyby engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to noise , or even to sound . The car took off ; with an acceleration which drove the Tellurian backward , deep into the cushions . The scream of tortured tires and the crescendo bellowing of the engine combined to form an uproar which , amplified by and reverberatingwithin the resonant shell of metal , threatened to addle the very brain inside the Lensman 's skull . " You suffer ! " the driver exclaimed , in high concern . " They cautioned me to start and stop gently , to drive slowly and carefully , to bump softly . They told me you are frail and fragile , a fact which I perceived for myself and which has caused me to drive with the utmost possible care and restraint . Is the fault mine ? Have I been too rough ? " " Not at all . It is n't that . It 's the ungodly noise . " Then , realizing that the Rigellian could have no conception of his meaning , he continued quickly : " The vibrations in the atmosphere , from sixteen cycles per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained what a second was . " My nervous system is very sensitive to those vibrations . But I expected them and shielded myself against them as adequately as I could . Nothing can be done about them . Go ahead . " " Atmospheric vibrations ? Atmospheric vibrations ? Atmosphericvibrationsf " The driver marveled , and concentratedupon this entirely new concept while hei . Swung around a steel-sheathed concrete pillar at a speed of at least sixty miles per hour , grazing it so closely that he removed one layer of protective coating from the metal. 2 . Braked so savagely to miss a wildly careening truck that the restraining straps almost cut Samms ' body , spacesuitand all , into slices. 3 . Darted into a hole in the traffic so narrow that only tiny fractions of inches separated his hurtling Juggernaut from an enormous steel column on one side and another speeding vehicle on the other. 4 . Executed a double-right-angle reverse curve , thus missing by hair 's breadths two vehicles traveling in the opposite direction and one in his own. 5 . As a grand climax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at full speed into a traffic artery which seemed so full already that it could not hold even one more car . But it could  --  just barely could . However , instead of near misses or grazing hits , this time there were bumps , dents  --  little ones , nothing at all , really , only an inch or so deep  --  and an utterly hellish concatenation and concentration of noise . " I fail completely to understand what effect such vibrationscould have , " the Rigellian announced finally , sublimely unconscious that anything at all out of the ordinary had occurred . For him , nothing had . " But surely they can not be of any use ? " " On this world , I am afraid not . No , " Samms admitted , wearily . " Here , too , apparently , as everywhere , the big cities are choking themselves to death with their own traffic . " " Yes . We build and build , but never have roads enough . " " What are those mounds along the streets ? " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , apparentlyopaque structures ; attracted to them because they were the only non-transparent objects within range of the Rigellian'smind . " Or is it something I should not mention ? " " What ? Oh , those ? By no means . " One of the near-by mounds lost its opacity . It was filled with swirling , gyrating bands and streamers of energy so vivid and so solid as to resemble fabric ; with wildly hurtling objects of indescribable shapes and contours ; with brilliantly flashing symbols which Samms found , greatly to his surprise , made sense  --  not through the Rigellian 's mind , but through his own Lens : " EAT TEEGMEE 'S FOOD ! " " Advertising ! " Samms ' thought was a snort . " Advertising . You do not perceive yours , either , as you drive ? " This was the first bond to be established between70 FIRST LENSMAN I RIGEL FOUR 71two of the most highly advanced races of the First Galaxy ! The frightful drive continued ; the noise grew worse and worse . Imagine , if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose entire length , breadth , height , and depth no attempt whatever had ever been made to abate any noise , however violent or piercing ! If your imagination has been sufficiently vivid and if you have worked understandinglyenough , the product may approximate what First LensmanSamms was forced to listen to that day . Through ever-thickening traffic , climbing to higher andever higher roadways between towering windowless walls of f steel , the massive Rigellian automobile barged and banged its way . Finally it stopped , a thousand feet or so above the ground , beside a building which was still under construction . The heavy door clanged open . They got out . And then  --  it chanced to be daylight at the time  --  Samms saw a tangle of fighting , screaming colors whose like no entity possessing the sense of sight had ever before imagined . Reds , yellows , blues , greens , purples , and every variation and inter-mixture possible ; laid on or splashed on or occurring naturally at perfect random , smote his eyes as violently as the all-pervading noise had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide 's sense of perceptionhe had been " seeing " only in shades of gray , that to these people " visible " light differed only in wave-length from any other band of the complete electromagnetic spectrumof vibration . Strained and tense , the Lensman followed his escort along a narrow catwalk , through a wall upon which riveters and welders were busily at work , into a room practically without walls and ceiled only by story after story of huge I-beams . Yet this was the meeting-place ; almost a hundred Rigellians were assembled there ! And as Samms walked toward the group a craneman dropped a couple of tons of steel plate , from a height of eight or ten feet , upon the floor directly behind him . " I just about jumped right out of my armor , " is the way Samms himself described his reactions ; and that descriptionis perhaps as good as any . At any rate , he went briefly out of control , and the Rigellian sent him a steadying , inquiring , wondering thought . He could no more understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these people , even the concept of physical intrusion was absolutely incomprehensible . These builders were not workmen , in the Tellurian sense . They were Rigellians , each working his few hours per week for the common good . They would be no more in contact with the meeting than would their fellows on the other side of the planet . Samms closed his eyes to the riot of clashing colors , deafened himself by main strength to the appalling clangor of sound , forced himself to concentrate every fiber of his mind upon his errand . " Please synchronize with my mind , as many of you as possible , " he thought at the group as a whole , and went en rapport with mind after mind after mind . And mind after mind after mind lacked something . Some were stronger than others , had more initiative and drive and urge , but none would quite do . Until " Thank God ! " In the wave of exultant relief , of fulfillment , Samms no longer saw the colors or heard the din . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are Dronvire . " " Yes , Virgil Samms , I am Dronvire ; and at long last I know what it is that I have been seeking all my life . But how of these , my other friends ? Are not some of them ... ? " " I do not know , nor is it necessary that I find out . You will select . . . " Samms paused , amazed . The other Rigellians were still in the room , but mentally , he and Dronvire were completely alone . " They anticipated your thought , and , knowing that it was to be more or less personal , they left us until one of us invites them to return . " " I like that , and appreciate it . You will go to Arisia . You will receive your Lens . You will return here . You will select and send to Arisia as many or as few of your fellowsas you choose . These things I require . you , by the Lens of Arisia , to do . Afterward  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like very much to have you visit Earth and accept appointment to the Galactic Council . Will you ? " " I will . " Dronvire needed no time to consider his decision . The meeting was dismissed . The same entity who had been Samms ' chauffeur on the in-bound trip drove him back to the Chicago , driving as " slowly " and as " carefully " as before . Nor , this time , did the punishment take such toll , even though Samms knew that each terrific lunge and lurch was adding one more bruise to the already much-too-large collection discoloring almost every square foot of his tough hide . He had succeeded , and the thrill of success had its usual analgesic effect . The Chicago 's captain met him in the air-lock and helped him remove his suit . " Are you sure you 're all right , Samms ? " Winfield was no longer the formal captain , but a friend . " Even though you did n't call , we were beginning to wonder . . . you look as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure as hell do n't like the way you 're favoring those ribs and that left leg . I 'll tell the boys you got back in A-prime shape , but I 'll have the doctors look you over , just to make sure . " Winfield made the announcement , and through his Lens Samms could plainly feel the wave of relief and pleasure that spread throughout the great ship with the news . It surprised him immensely . Who was he , that all these boys should care so much whether he lived or died ? " I 'm perfectly all right , " Samms protested . " There 's nothing at all the matter with me that twenty hours of sleep wo n't fix as good as new . " " Maybe ; but you 'll go to the sick-bay first , just the same , " Winfield insisted . " And I suppose you want me to blast back to Tellus ? " " Right . And fast . The Ambassadors ' Ball is next Tuesdayevening , you know , and that 's one function I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Double Prime excuse . " HE AMBASSADORS ' BALL , ONE of the most ultra-ultra functions of the year , was well under way . It was not that everyone who was anyone was there ; but everyone who was there was , in one way or another , very emphatically someone . Thus , there were affairs at which there were more young and beautiful women , and more young and handsome men ; but none exhibiting newer or more expensive gowns , more ribbons and decorations , more or costlier or more refined jewelry , or a larger acreage of powdered and perfumed epidermis . And even so , the younger set was well enough represented . Since pioneering appeals more to youth than to age , the men representing the colonies were young ; and their wives , together with the daughters and the second ( or third or fourth , or occasionally the fifth ) wives of the human personages practically balanced the account . Nor was the throng entirely human . The time had not yet come , of course , when warm-blooded , oxygen-breathing monstrosities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the humanity present : There were , however , a few Martians on the floor , wearing their light " robes du convention " and dancing with meticulously mathematical precision . A few Venerians , who did not dance , sat in state or74 FIRST LENSMANwaddled importantly about . Many worlds of the Solarian System , and not a few other systems , were represented . One couple stood out , even against that opulent and magnificent background . Eyes followed them wherever they went . The girl was tall , trim , supple ; built like a symphony . Her Callistan vexto-silk gown , of the newest and most violentshade of " radioactive " green , was phosphorescently luminous ; fluorescent ; gleaming and glowing . Its hem swept the floor , but above the waist it vanished mysteriously except for wisps which clung to strategic areas here and there with no support , apparently , except the personal magnetism of the wearer . She , almost alone of all the women there , wore no flowers . Her only jewelry was a rosette of huge , perfectlymatchedemeralds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike the other womens ' flawless coiffures , was a flamboyant , artistically-disarranged , red-bronzeauburnmop . Her soft and dewy eyes  --  Virgilia Samms could control her eyes as perfectly as she could her highly educated hands  --  were at the moment gold-flecked , tawny wells of girlishinnocence and trust . " But I ca n't give you this next dance , too , Herkimer  --  Honestly I ca n't ! " she pleaded , snuggling just a trifle closer into the embrace of the young man who was just as much man , physically , as she was woman . " I 'd just love to , really , but I just simply ca n't , and you know why , too . " " You 've got some duty-dances , of course ... " " Some ? I 've got a list as long as from here to there !

" She went down the list , and as she named or characterizedeach entity another finger of her left hand pressed down upon the back of her partner 's right , to emphasize the count of her social obligations . But those talented fingers were doing more  --  far , far more  --  than that . Herkimer Herkimer Third , although no little of a DonOPERATION ZWILNIK  --  THIONITE 75Juan , was a highly polished , smoothly finished , thoroughly seasoned diplomat . As such , his eyes and his other features  --  particularly his eyes  --  had been schooled for years to reveal no trace of whatever might be going on inside his brain . If he had entertained any suspicion of the beautiful girl in his arms , if anyone had suggested that she was trying her best to pump him , he would have smiled the sort of smile which only the top-drawer diplomat can achieve . He was not suspicious of Virgilia Samms . However , simply because she was Virgil Samms ' daughter , he took an extra bit of pains to betray no undue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And besides , she was not looking at his eyes , nor even at his face . Her glance , demurely downcast , was all too rarely raised above the level of his chin . There were some things , however , that Herkimer HerkimerThird did not know . That Virgilia Samms was the most accomplished muscle-reader of her times . That she was so close to him , not because of his manly charm , but because only in that position could she do her prodigious best . That she could work with her eyes alone , but in emergencies , when fullest possible results were imperative , she had to use her exquisitely sensitive fingers and her exquisitely tactile skin . That she had studied intensively , and had tabulated the reactions of , each of the entities on her list . That she was now , with his help , fitting those reactions into a pattern . And finally , that that pattern was beginning to assume the grim shape of MURDER ! And Virgilia Samms , working now for something far more urgent and vastly more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herkimer was not a muscle-reader too ; for she knew that she was revealing her secrets even more completely than was he . In fact , if things got much worse , he could not help but feel the poundingof her heart ... but she could explain that easily enough , by a few appropriate wriggles . . . No , he was n't a reader , definitely not . He was n't watching the right places ; he was looking where that gown had been designed to make him look , and nowhere else . . . and no tell-tale muscles lay beneath any76 FIRST LENSMAN I OPERATION ZWILNIK  --  THIONITE 77part of either of his hands . As her eyes and her fingers and her lovely torso sent more and more information to her keen brain , Jill grew more and more anxious . She was sure that murder was intended , but who was to be the victim ? Her father ? Probably . Pops Kinnison ? Possibly . Somebody else ? Barely possibly . And when ? And where ? And how ? She did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names had n't been enough , but a personal appearance . . . Why did n't dad show up  --  or did she wish he would n't come at all ... ? Virgil Samms entered the ball-room . " And dad told me , Herkimer , " she cooed sweetly , gazing up into his eyes for the first time in over a minute , " that I must dance with every one of them . So you see . . . Oh ; there he is now , over there ! I 've been wondering where he 's been keeping himself . " She nodded toward the entrance and prattled on artlessly . " He 's almost never late , you know , and I 've ... " He looked , and as his eyes met those of the First Lensman , Jill learned three of the facts she needed so badly to know . Her father . Here . Soon . She never knew how she managed to keep herself under control ; but , some way and just barely , she did . Although nothing showed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before been . What could she do ? She knew , but she did not have a scrap or an iota of visible or tangible evidence ; and if she made one single slip , however slight , the consequences could be immediate and disastrous . After this dance might be too late . She could make an excuse to leave the floor , but that would look very bad , later ... and none of them would Lens her , she knew , while she was with Herkimer  --  damn such chivalry ! ... She could take the chance of waving at her father , since she had n't seen him for so long . . . no , the smallest risk would be with Mase . He looked at her every chance he got , and she 'd make him use his Lens . . Northrop looked at her ; and over Herkimer 's shoulder , for one fleeting instant , she allowed her face to reveal the terrified appeal she so keenly felt . " Want me , Jill ? " His Lensed thought touched only the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a kiss : no one except her father had ever really put a Lens on Virgilia Samms . Nevertheless : " Want you ! I never wanted anybody so much in my life ! Come in , Mase  --  quick  --  please ! " Diffidently enough , he came ; but at the first inkling of the girl 's news all thought of diffidence or of privacy vanished . " Jack ! Spud ! Mr. Kinnison ! Mr. Samms ! " he Lensed sharp , imperative , almost frantic thoughts . " Listen in ! " " Steady , Mase , I 'll take over , " came Roderick Kinnison'sdeeper , quieter mental voice . " First , the matter of guns . Anybody except me wearing a pistol ? You are , Spud ? " " Yes , sir . " " You would be . But you and Mase , Jack ? " " We 've got our Lewistons ! " " You would have . Blasters , my **31;5366;TOOLONG , are fine weapons indeed for certain kinds of work . In emergencies , it is of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a crowd as this , though , it is much better technique to kill only the one you are aiming at . So skip out to my car , you two , right now , and change  --  and make it fast . " E ' eryone knew that RoderickKinnison 's car was at all times an arsenal on wheels . " Wish you were in uniform , too , Virge , but it ca n't be helped now . Work your way  --  slowly  --  around to the northwest corner . Spud , do the same . " " It 's impossible  --  starkly unthinkable ! " and " I 'm not sure of anything , really ... " Samms and his daughter began simultaneously to protest . " Virgil , you talk like a man with a paper nose . Keep still until after you 've used your brain . And I 'm sure enough of what you know , Jill , to take plenty of steps . You can relax now  --  take it easy . We 're covering Virgil and I called78 FIRST LENSMAN 1 OPERATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax a little , I see . Good ! I 'm not trying to hide from anybody that the next few minutesmay he critical . Are you pretty sure , Jill , that Herkimer is a key man ? " " Pretty sure , Pops . " How much better she felt , now that the Lensmen were on guard ! " In this one case , at least . " " Good ! Then let him talk you into giving him every dance , right straight through until something breaks . Watch him . He must know the signal and who is going to operate , and if you can give us a fraction of a second of warning it will help no end . Can do ? " " I 'll say I can  --  and I would love to , the big , slimy , stinking skinker ! " As transliterated into words , the girl 's thought may seem a trifle confused , but Kinnison knew exactly what she meant . " One more thing , Jill ; a detail . The boys are coming back in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herkimer notices that they have changed their holsters . " " No , he did n't notice , " Jill reported , after a moment . " But I do n't notice any difference , either , and I 'm looking for it . " " Nevertheless , it 's there , and the difference between a Mark Seventeen and a Mark Five is something more than that between Tweedledum and Tweedledee , " Kinnison returned , dryly . " However , it may not be as obvious to nonmilitarypersonnel as it is to us . That 's far enough , boys , do n't get too close . Now , Virge , keep solidly en rapport with Jill on one side and with us on the other , so that she wo n't have to give herself and the show away by yelling and pointing , and ... " " But this is preposterous ! " Samms stormed . " Preposterous , hell , " Roderick Kinnison 's thought was still coldly level ; only the fact that he was beginning to use non-ballroom language revealed any sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic and start using your brain . You turned down fifty billion credits . Why do you suppose they offered that much , when they can get anybody killed for a hundred ? And what would they do about it ? " " But they could n't get away with it , Rod , at an Ambassadors ' Ball . They could n't , possibly . " " Formerly , no . That was my first thought , too . But it was you who pointed out to me , not so long ago , that the techniques of crime have changed of late . In the new light , the swankier the brawl the greater the confusion and the better the chance of getting away clean . Comb that out of your whiskers , you red-headed mule ! " " Well . . . there might be something in it , after all ... " Samms ' thought showed apprehension at last . " You know damn well there is . But you boys  --  Jack and Mase especially  --  loosen up . You ca n't do good shooting while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do something  --  talkto your partners or think at Jill ... " " That wo n't be hard , sir . " Mason Northrop grinned feebly . " And that reminds me of something , Jill . Mentor certainly bracketed the target when he  --  or she , or it , maybe  --  said that you would never need a Lens . " " Huh ? " Jill demanded , inelegantly . " I do n't see the connection , if any . " " No ? Everybody else does , I 'll bet . How about it ? " The other Lensmen , even Samms , agreed enthusiastically . " Well , do you think that any of those characters , particularly Herkimer Herkimer Third , would let a harness bull in harness  --  evensuch a beautiful one as you  --  get close enough to him to do such a Davey the Dip act on his mind ? " " Oh . . . I never thought of that , but it 's right , and I 'm glad . . . but Pops , you said something about support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be ? I hope I can hold out , with you all supporting me , but . . . " " You can , Jill . Two or three minutes more , at most . " " Support ? In force ? What do you mean ? " Samms snapped . " Just that . The whole damned army , " Kinnison replied . " I sent Two-Star Commodore Alexander Clayton a thought that lifted him right out of his chair . Everything he 's got , at full emergency blast . Armor  --  mark eighty fours  --  six by six extra heavies  --  a ninety sixty for an ambulance  --  full escort , 80 FIRST LENSMAN OPERATION ZWILNIK  --  THIONITE 81upstairs and down  --  way-friskers  --  ' copters  --  cruisers and big stuff  --  in short , the works . I would have run with you before this , if I dared ; but the minute the relief party shows up , we do a flit . " " If you daredp " Jill asked , shaken by the thought . " Exactly , my dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do our damndest , but I 'm praying they wo n't . " But Kinnison 's prayers-if he made any  --  were ignored . Jill heard a sharp , but very usual and insignificant sound ; someone had dropped a pencil . She felt an inconspicuous muscle twitch slightly . She saw the almost imperceptible tensing of a neck-muscle which would have turned Herkimer'shead in a certain direction if it had been allowed to act . Her eyes flashed along that line , searched busily for milliseconds . A man was reaching unobstrusively , as though for a handkerchief . But men at Ambassadors ' Balls do not carry blue handkerchiefs ; nor does any fabric , however dyed , resembleat all closely the blued steel of an automatic pistol . Jill would have screamed , then , and pointed ; but she had time to do neither . Through her rapport with her father the Lensmen saw everything that she saw , in the instant of her seeing it . Hence five shots blasted out , practically as one , before the girl could scream , or point , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since dozens of other women were screaming , too , it made no difference  --  then . Conway Costigan , trigger-nerved spacehound that he was and with years of gun-fighting and of hand-to-hand brawling in his log , shot first ; even before the gunman did . It was Costigan 's blinding speed that saved Virgil Samms ' life that day ; for the would-be assassin was dying , with a heavy slug crashing through his brain , before he finished pulling the trigger . The dying hand twitched upward . The bullet intended for Samms ' heart went high ; through the fleshy part of the shoulder . Roderick Kinnison , because of his age , and his son and Northrop , because of their inexperience , were a few millisecondsslow . They , however , were aiming for the body , not for the head ; and any of those three resulting wounds wouldhave been satisfactorily fatal . The man went down , and stayed down . Samms staggered , but did not go down until the elder Kinnison , as gently as was consistent with the maximum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get back ! Give him air ! " Men began to shout , the while pressing closer themselves . " Yoti men , stand back . Some of you go get a stretcher . You women , come here . " Kinnison 's heavy , parade-ground voice smashed down all lesser noises . " Is there a doctor here ? " There was ; and , after being " frisked " for weapons , he went busily to work . " Joy  --  Betty  --  Jill  --  Clio , " Kinnison called his own wife and their daughter , Virgilia Samms , and Mrs. Costigan . " You four first . Now you  --  and you  --  and you  --  and you . . . " he went on , pointing out large , heavy women wearing extremely extreme gowns , " Stand here , right over him . Cover him up , so that nobody else can get a shot at him . You other women , stand behind and between these  --  closer yet  --  fill those spaces up solid  --  there ! Jack , stand there . Mase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take , this one . Now , everybody , listen . I know damn well that none of you women are wearing guns above the waist , and you 've all got long skirts  --  thank God for ballgowns ! Now , fellows , if any one of these women makes a move to lift her skirt , blow her brains out , right then , without waiting to ask questions . " " Sir , I protest ! This is outrageous ! " one of the dowagersexclaimed . " Madam , I agree with you fully . It is . " Kinnison smiled as genuinely as he could under the circumstances . " It is , however , necessary . I will apologize to all you ladies , and to you , doctor  --  in writing if you like  --  after we have Virgil Samms aboard the Chicago ; but until then I would not trust my own grandmother . " The doctor looked up . " The Chicago ? This wound does not appear to be a very serious one , but this man is going to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . please .. . 82 FIRST LENSMAN OPERATION ZWILNIK  --  THIONITE 83easy . . . there , that is excellent . Call an ambulance , please , immediately . " " I did . Long ago . But no hospital , doctor . All those windows  --  open to the public  --  or the whole place bombed  --  by no means . I 'm taking no chances whatever . " " Except with your own life ! " Jill put in sharply , lookingup from her place at her father 's side . Assured that the First Lensman was in no danger of dying , she had begun to take interest in other things . " You are important , too , you know , and you 're standing right out there in the open . Get another stretcher , lie down on it , and we 'll guard you , too ... and do n't be too stiff-necked to take your own advice ! " she flared , as he hesitated . " I 'm not , if it were necessary , but it is n't . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be next in line . But since he got only a scratch , there 'd be no point at all in killing even a good Number Two . " " A scratch ! " Jill fairly seethed . " Do you call that horriblewound a scratch ? " " Huh ? Why , certainly  --  that 's all it is  --  thanks to you , " he returned , in honest and complete surprise . " No bones shattered  --  nomain arteries cut  --  missed the lung  --  he 'll be as good as new in a couple of weeks . " " And now , " he went on aloud , " if you ladies will please pick up this stretcher we will move en masse , and slowly , toward the door . " The women , no longer indignant but apparently enjoying the sensation of being the center of interest , complied with the request . " Now , boys , " Kinnison Lensed a thought . " Did any of you  --  Costigan ?  --  see any signs of a concerted rush , such as there would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfered ? " " No , sir , " came Costigan 's brisk reply . " None within sight of me . " " Jack and Mase  --  I do n't suppose you looked ? " They had n't  --  had not thought of it in time . " You 'll learn . It takes a few things like this to make itautomatic . But I could n't see any , either , so I 'm fairly certainthere was n't any . Smart operators  --  quick on the up-take . " " I 'd better get at this , sir , do n't you think , and let Operation Boskone go for a while ? " Costigan asked . " I do n't think so . " Kinnison frowned in thought . " This operation was planned , son , by people with brains . Any clues you could find now would undoubtedly be plants . No , we 'll let the regulars look ; we 'll stick to our own ... " Sirens wailed and screamed outside . Kinnison sent out an exploring thought . " Alex ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and nurses ? It 's too wide for the gates . " " Go through the wall . Across the lawn . Right up to the door , and never mind the frippery they 've got all over the place  --  have your adjutant tell them to bill us for damage . Samms is shot in the shoulder . Not too serious , but I 'm taking him to the Hill , where I know he 'll be safe . What have you got on top of the umbrella , the Boise or the Chicago ? I have n't had time to look up yet . " " Both . " " Good man . " Jack Kinnison stared at the monstrous tank , which was smashing statues , fountains , and ornamental trees flat into the earth as it moved ponderously across the grounds , and licked his lips . He looked at the companies of soldiers " frisking " the route , the grounds , and the crowd  --  higher up , at the hovering helicopters  --  still higher , at the eight light cruisersso evidently and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long streamers of fire which , he now knew , marked the locations of the two most powerful engines of destruction ever built by man  --  and his face turned slowly white . " Good Lord , Dad ! " he swallowed twice . " I had no idea ... but they might , at that . " " Not might ' , son . They damn well would , if they could get here soon enough with heavy enough stuff . " The elder Kinnison 's jaw-muscles did not loosen , his darting eyes did84 FIRST LENSMAN OPERATION ZWILNIK  --  THIONITE 85not relax their vigilance for a fraction of a second as he Lensed the thought . " You boys ca n't be expected to know it all ; but right now you 're learning fast . Get this  --  paste it in your iron hats . Virgil Sa , nms ' life is the most important thing in this whole damned universe ! If they had got him then it would not , strictly speaking , have been my fault , but if they get him now , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop against the very entrance , and a white-clad man leaped out . " Let me look at him , please ... " " Not yet ! " Kinnison denied , sharply . " Not until he 's got four inches of solid steel between him and whoever wants to finish the job they started . Get your men around him , and get him aboard  --  fast ! " Samms , protected at every point at every instant , was lifted into the maw of the ninety-sixty ; and as the massive door clanged shut Kinnison heaved a tremendous sigh of re- lief . The cavalcade moved away . " Coming with us , Rod ? " car wait for me , and I 'll join you . " He turned to the three young Lensmen and the girl . " This fouls up our plans a little , but not too much  --  I hope . No change in Mateese or Boskone ; you and Costigan , Jill , can go ahead as planned . Northrop , you 'll have to brief Jill on Zwilnik and find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the brawl here , but you know as much about it now as any of us . Check with Knobos , DalNalten , and Fletcher  --  while Virgil is laid up you and Jack may have to work on both Zabriska and Zwilnik  --  he 'll Lens you . Get the dope , then do as you think best . Get going ! " He strode away toward the waiting staff-car . " Boskone ? Zwilnik ? " Jill demanded . " What gives ? What are they , Jack ? " " We do n't know yet  --  maybe we 're going to name a couple of planets . . . " " Piffle ! " she scoffed . " Can you talk sense , Mase ? What 's Boskone ? " " A simple , distinctive , pronounceable coined word ; suggested , I believe , by Dr. Bergenholm . . . " he began . " You know what I mean , you . . . " she broke in , but was silenced by a sharply Lensed thought from Jack . His touch was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , she flinched . " Use your brain , Jill ; you are n't thinking a lick  --  not that you can be blamed for it . Stop talking ; there may be lipreadersor high-powered listeners around . This feels funny , does n't it ? " He twitched mentally and went on : " You already know what Operation Mateese is , since it 's your own dish  --  politics . Operation Zwilnik is drugs , vice , and so on . Operation Boskone is pirates ; Spud is running tfiat . OperationZabriska is Mase and me checking some peculiar disturbancesin the sub-ether . Come in , Mase , and do your stuff  - -  I 'll see you later , aboard . Clear ether , Jill ! " Young Kinnison vanished from the fringes of her mind and Northrop appeared . And what a difference ! His mind touched hers as gingerly as Jack 's had done ; as skittishly , as instantaneously ready to bolt away from anything in the least degree private . However , Jack 's mind had rubbed hers the wrong way , right from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this Operation Zwilnik , " Jill began " Something else first . I could n't help noticing , back there , that you and Jack . . . well , not out of phase , exactly , or really out of sync , but sort of . . . well , as though ... " " Hunting ' ? " she suggested . " Not exactly . . . forcing ' might be better  --  like holding a tight beam together when it wants to fall apart . So you noticed it yourself ? " " Of course , but I thought Jack and I were the only ones who did . Like scratching a blackboard with your fingernails  --  youcan do it , hut you 're awfully glad to stop . . . and I like Jack , too , darn it  --  at a distance . " " And you and I fit like precisely tuned circuits . Jack really meant it , then , when he said that you . . . that is , he . . . I did n't quite believe it until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , what you 've already done to me. " 86 FIRST LENSMAN OPERATION ZWILNIK  --  THIONITE 87Jill 's block went on , full strength . She arched her eyebrows and spoke aloud  --  " why , I have n't the faintest idea ! " " Of course not . That 's why you 're using voice . I 've found out , too , that I ca n't lie with my mind . I feel like a heel and a louse , with so much job ahead , but you 've simply got to tell me something . Then  --  whatever you say  --  I 'll hit the job with everything I 've got . Do I get heaved out between planets without a space-suit , or not ? " " I do n't think so . " Jill blushed vividly , but her voice was steady . " You would rate a space-suit , and enough oxygen to reach another plan  --  another goal . And now we 'd better get to work , do n't you think ? " " Yes . Thanks , Jill , a million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking out of turn , and how much  --  but I had to know . " He breathed deep . " And that 's all I ask  --  for now . Cut your screens . " She lowered her mental barriers , finding it surprisingly easy to do so in this case ; let them down almost as far as she was in the habit of doing with her father . He explained in flashing thoughts everything he knew of the four Operations , concluding : " I 'm not assigned to Zabriska permanently ; I 'll probably work with you on Mateese after your father gets back into circulation . I 'm to act more as a liaison man  --  neither Knobos nor DalNalten knows you well enough to Lens you . Right ? " " Yes , I 've met Mr. Knobos only once , and have never even seen Dr. DalNalten . " " Ready to visit them , via Lens ? " " Yes . Go ahead . " The two Lensmen came in . They came into his mind , not hers . Nevertheless their thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clearly as though all four were speaking to each other face to face . " What a weird sensation ! " Jill exclaimed . " Why , I never imagined anything like it ! " " We are sorry to trouble you , Miss Samms . . " Jill was surprised anew . The silent voice deep within her mind was of characteristically Martian timber , but instead of theharshly gutteral consonants and the hissing sibilants of any Martian 's best efforts at English , pronunciation and enunciationwere flawless . " Oh , I did n't mean that . It 's no trouble at all , really , I just have n't got used to this telepathy yet . " " None of us has , to any noticeable degree . But the reason for this call is to ask you if you have anything new , however slight , to add to our very small knowledge of Zwilnik ? " " Very little , I 'm afraid ; and that little is mostly guesses , deductions , and jumpings at conclusions . Father told you about the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data is not to be expected . Hints , suggestions , possible leads , will he of inestimable value . " " Well , I met a very short , very fat Venerian , named Ossmen , at a party at the European Embassy . Do either of you know him ? " " I know of him , " DalNalten replied . " A highly reputablemerchant , with such large interests on Tellus that he has to spend most of his time here . He is not in any one of our books . . . although there is nothing at all surprising in that fact . Go on , please , Miss Samms . " " He did n't come to the party with Senator Morgan ; but he came to some kind of an agreement with him that night , and I am pretty sure that it was about thionite . That 's the only new item I have . " " Thionite ! " The three Lensmen were equally surprised . " Yes . Thionite . Definitely . " " How sure are you of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am not sure that this particular agreement was about thionite , no ; but the probability is roughly nine-tenths . I am sure , however , that both Senator Morgan and Ossmen know a lot about thionite that they want to hide . Both gave very high positive reactions  --  well beyond the six-sigma point of virtual certainty . " There was a pause , broken by the Martian , but not by a thought directed at any one of the three. 88 FIRST LENSMAN " Sid ! " he called , and even Jill could feel the Lensed thought speed . " Yes , Knobos ? Fletcher . " " That haul-in you made , out in the asteroids . Heroin , hadive , and ladolian , was n't it ? No thionite involved anywhere ? " " No thionite . However , you must remember that part of the gang got away , so all I can say positively is that we did n't see , or hear about , any thionite . There was some gossip , of course ; but you know there always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jill could feel the brilliant Martian 's mental gears whirl and click . Then he went into such a flashing exchange of thought with the Venerian that the girl lost track in seconds . " One more question , Miss Samms ? " DalNalten asked . " Have you detected any indications that there may be some connection between either Ossmen or Morgan and any officeror executive of Interctellar Spaceways ? " " Spaceways ! Isaacson ? " Jill caught her breath . " Why ... nobody even thought of such a thing  --  at least , nobody ever mentioned it to me  --  I never thought of making any such tests . " " The possibility occurred to me only a moment ago , at your mention of thionite . The connection , if any exists , will be exceedingly difficult to trace . But since most , if not all , of the parties involved will probably be included in your Operation Mateese , and since a finding , either positive or negative , would be tremendously significant , we feel emboldenedto ask you to keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . I 'll be very glad to . " " We thank you for your courtesy and your help . One or both of us will get in touch with you from time to time , now that we know the pattern of your personality . May immortal Grolossen speed the healing of your father 's wound . " CHAPTER7Battle of The HillATE THAT NIGHT  --  OR , RATHER , very early the following morning  --  Senator Morgan and his Number One secretary were closeted in the former 's doubly spy-ray-proofed office . Morgan 's round , heavy , florid face had perhaps lost a little of its usual color ; the fingers of his left hand drummed soundlessly upon the glass top of his desk . His shrewd gray eyes , however , were as keen and as calculating as ever . " This things smells , Herkimer . . . it reeks . . . but I still ca n't figure any of the angles . That operation was planned . Sure fire , it could n't miss . Right up to the last split second it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Patrol landed and everything was under control . There must have been a leak somewhere  --  but where in hell could it have been ? " " There could n't have been a leak , Chief ; it does n't make sense . " The secretary uncrossed his long legs , recrossed them in the other direction , threw away a half-smoked cigarette , lit another . " If there 'd been any kind of a leak they would have done a lot more than just kill the low man on the ladder . You know as well as I do that Rocky Kinnison is the hardest-boiledcharacter this side of hell . If he had known anything , he would have killed everybody in sight , including90 FIRST LENSMAN BATTLE OF THE HILL 91you and me . Besides , if there had been a leak , he would not have let Samms get within ten thousand miles of the place  --  that 's one sure thing . Another is he would n't have waited until after it was all over to get his army there . No Chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Kinnison found out  --  probably Samms , he 's a hell of a lot smarter than Kinnison is , you know  --  he learned right there and then . He must have seen Brainerd start to pull his gun . " " I thought of that . I 'd buy it , except for one fact . Apparently you did n't time the interval between the shots and the arrival of the tanks . " " Sorry , Chief . " Herkimer 's face was a study in chagrin . " I made a bad slip there . " " I 'll say you did . One minute and fifty eight seconds . " " What ! " Morgan remained silent . " The patrol is fast , of course . . . and always ready .. . and they would yank the stuff in on tractor beams , not under their own power . . . but even so . . . five minutes , is my guess , Chief . Four and a half , absolute minimum . " " Check . And where do you go from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . That blows everything wide open . One set of facts says there was a leak , which occurred between two and a half and three minutes before the signal was given . I ask you , Chief , does that make sense ? " " No . That 's what is bothering me . As you say , the facts seem to be contradictory . Somebody must have learned somethingbefore anything happened ; but if they did , why did n't they do more ? And Murgatroyd . If they did n't know about him , why the ships  --  especially the big battlewagons ? If they did think he might be out there somewhere , why did n't they go and find out ? " " Now I 'll ask one . Why did n't our Mr. Murgatroyd do something ? Or was n't the pirate fleet supposed to be in on this ? Probably not , though . " " My guess would be the same as yours . Ca n't see any reason for having a fleet cover a one-man operation , especially as well-planned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . These Lensmen are . I was watching them every second . Neither Samms nor Kinnison did anything whatever during that two minutes . " , " Young Kinnison and Northrop each left the hall about that time . " " I know it . So they did . Either one of them could have called the Patrol  --  but what has that to do with the price of beef C. I. F. Valeria ? " Herkimer refrained tactfully from answering the savage question . Morgan drummed and thought for minutes , then went on slowly : " There are two , and only two , possibilities ; neither of which seem even remotely possible . It was  --  must have been  --  either the Lens or the girl . " " The girl ? Act your age , Senator . I knew where she was , and what she was doing , every second . " " That was evident . " Morgan stopped drumming and smiled cynically . " I 'm getting a hell of a kick out of seeing you taking it , for a change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Herkimer 's handsome face hardened . " That game is n't over , my friend . " " That 's what you think , " the Senator jibed . " Ca n't believe that any woman can be Herkimer-proof , eh ? You 've been working on her for six weeks now , instead of the usual six hours , and you have n't got anywhere yet . " " I will , Senator . " Herkimer 's nostrils flared viciously . " I 'll get her , one way or another , if it 's the last thing I ever do . " " I 'll give you eight to five you do n't ; and a six-month time limit . " " I 'll take five thousand of that . But what makes you think that she 's anything to be afraid of ? She 's a trained psychologist , yes ; but so am I ; and I 'm older and more experiencedthan she is . That leaves that yoga stuff  --  her learning how to sit cross-legged , how to contemplate her navel , and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you figure that puts her in my class ? " " I told you , I do n't . Nothing makes sense . But she is92 FIRST LENSMAN BATTLE OF THE HILL 93Virgil Samms ' daughter . " " What of it ? You did n't gag on George Olmstead  --  you picked him yourself for one of the toughest jobs we 've got . By blood he 's just about as close to Virgil Samms as Virgilia is . They might as well have been hatched out of the same egg . " Physically , yes . Mentally and psychologically , no . Olmsteadis a realist , a materialist . He wants his reward in this world , not the next , and is out to get it . Furthermore , the job will probably kill him , and even if it does n't , he will never be in a position of trust or where he can learn much of anything . On the other hand , Virgil Samms is  --  but I do n't need to tell you what he is like . But you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is n't playing around with you because of your overpowering charm ... " " Listen , Chief . She did n't know anything and she did n't do anything . I was dancing with her all the time , as close as that , " he clasped his hands tightly together , " so I know what I 'm talking about . And if you think she could ever learn anything from me , skip it . You know that nobody on Earth , or anywhere else , can read my face ; and besides , she was playing coy right then  --  was n't even looking at me . So count her out . " " We 'll have to , I guess . " Morgan resumed his quiet drumming . " If there were any possibility that she ' pumped you I 'd send you to the mines , but there 's no sign . . . that leaves the Lens . It has seemed , right along , more logical than the girl  --  but a lot more fantastic . Been able to find out anything more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been advertising . Combination radio-phone , automatic language-converter , telepath , and so on . Badge of the top skimmings of the top-bracket cops . But I began to think , out there on the floor , that they are n't advertising everything they know . " " So did I. You tell me . " " Take the time zero minus three minutes . Besides the five Lensmen  --  and Jill Samms  --  the place was full of top brass ; scrambled eggs all over the floor . Commodores andlieutenant-Commodores from all continental governments of the Earth , the other planets , and the colonies , all wearing full-dress side-arms . Nobody knew anything then ; we agree on that . But within the next few seconds , somebody found out something and called for help . One of the Lensmen could possibly have done that without showing signs . BUT  --  at zero time all four Lensmen had their guns out  --  and not Lewistons , please note  --  and were shooting ; whereas none of the other armed officers knew that anything was going on until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lens . " " That 's the way I figured it . But the difficulties remain unchanged . How ? Mind-reading ? " " Space-drift ! " Herkimer snorted . " My mind ca n't be read . " " Nor mine . " " And besides , if they could read minds , they would n't have waited until the last possible split second to do it , unless . say , wait a minute ! . . . Did Brainerd act or look nervous , toward the last ? I was n't to look at him , you know . " " Not nervous , exactly ; but he did get a little tense . " " There you are , then . Hired murderers are n't smart . A Lensman saw him tighten up and got suspicious . Turned in the alarm on general principles . Warned the others to keep on their toes . But even so , it does n't look like mind-readingthey'dhave killed him sooner . They were watchful , and mighty quick on the draw . " " That could be it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I ever saw cooked up , but it does cover the facts . . . and the two of us will be able to make it stick .. . but take notice , pretty boy , that certain parties are not going to like this at all . In fact , they are going to be very highly put out . " " That 's a nice hunk of understatement , boss . But notice one beautiful thing about this story ? " Herkimer grinned maliciously . " It lets us pass the buck to Big Jim Towne . We can be  --  and will be  --  sore as hell because he picks such weak-sister characters to do his killings ! " * * * * *94 FIRST LENSMAN BATTLE OF THE HILL 95In the heavily armored improvised ambulance , Virgil Samms sat up and directed a thought at his friend Kinnison , finding his mind a turmoil of confusion . " What 's the matter , Rod ? " " Plenty ! " the big Lensman snapped back . " They were  --  maybe still are  --  too damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have n't even suspected . I stood by , as innocent as a three-year-old girl baby , and let you walk right into that one  --  and I emphatically do not enjoy getting caught with my pants down that way . It makes me jumpy . This may be all , but it may not be -- not by eleven thousand light-years  --  and I 'm trying to dope out what is going to happen next . " " And what have you deduced ? " " Nothing . I 'm stuck . So I 'm tossing it into your lap . Besides , that 's what you are getting paid for , thinking . So go ahead and think . What would you be doing , if you were on the other side ? " " I see . You think , then , that it might not be good techniqueto take the time to go back to the spaceport ? " " You get the idea . But  --  can you stand transfer ? " " Certainly . They got my shoulder dressed and taped , and my arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , but not much . I can walk without falling down . " " Fair enough . Clayton ! " He Lensed a vigorous thought . " Have any of the observers spotted anything , high up or far off ? " " No , sir . " " Good . Kinnison to Commodore Clayton , orders . Have a ' copter come down and pick up Samms and myself on tractors . Instruct the Boise and the cruisers to maintain utmost vigilance . Instruct the Chicago to pick us up . Detach the Chicago and the Boise from your task force . Assign them to me . Off . " " Clayton to Commissioner Kinnison . Orders received and are being carried out . Off . " The transfers were made without incident . The two superdreadnaughts leaped into the high stratosphere and torewestward . Half-way to the Hill , Kinnison called Dr. FrederickRodebush . " Fred ? Kinnison . I-Iave Cleve and Bergenholm link up with us . Now  --  how are the Geigers on the outside of the Hill behaving ? " " Normal , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? " Kinnison detailed the happenings of the recent past . " So tell the boys to unlimber all the stuff the Hill has got . " " My God ! " Cleveland exclaimed . " Why , that 's puttingus back to the days of the Interplanetary Wars ! " " With one notable exception , " Kinnison pointed out . " The attack , if any , will be strictly modern . I hope we 'll be able to handle it . One good thing , the old mountain 's got a lot of sheer mass . How much radioactivity will it stand ? " " Allotropic iron , U-235 , or plutonium ? " Rodebush seized his slide-rule . " What difference does it make ? " " From a practical standpoint . . . perhaps none . But with a task force defending , not many bombs could get through , so I 'd say ... " " I was n't thinking so much of bombs . " " What , then ? " " Isotopes . A good , thick blanket of dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill 's screens could handle . We 've got to decide , first , whether Virgil will be safer there in the Hill or out in space in the Chicago ; and second , for how long . " " I see . . . I 'd say here , under the Hill . Months , perhaps years , before anything could work down this far . And we can always get out . No matter how hot the surface gets , we 've got enough screen , heavy water , cadmium , lead , mercury , and everything else necessary to get him out through the locks . " " That 's what I was hoping you 'd say . And now , about the defense ... I wonder ... I do n't want everybody to think I 've gone completely hysterical , but I 'll be damned if I want to get caught again with . . . " His thought faded out. 96 FIRST LENSMAN BATTLE OF THE HILL 97 " May I offer a suggestion , sir ? " Bergenholm 's thought broke the prolonged silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your suggestions so far have n't been idle vaporings . Another hunch ? " " No , sir , a logical procedure . It has been some months since the last emergency call-out drill was held . If you issue such another call now , and nothing happens , it can be simply another surprise drill ; with credit , promotion , and monetary awards for the best performances ; further practice and instructionfor the less proficient units . " " Splendid , Dr. Bergenholm ! " Samms ' brilliant and agile mind snatched up the thought and carried it along . " And what a chance , Rod , for something vastly larger and more important than a Continental , or even a Tellurian , drill  --  make it the first maneuver of the Galactic Patrol ! " " I 'd like to , Virge , but we ca n't . My boys are ready , but you are n't . No top appointments and no authority . " " That can be arranged in a very few minutes . We have been waiting for the psychological moment . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You yourself expect an attack , do you not ? " " Yes . I would not start anything unless and until I was ready to finish it , and I see no reason for assuming that whoever it was that tried to kill you is not at least as good a planner as I am . " " And the rest of you . . . ? Dr. Bergenholm ? " " My reasoning , while it does not exactly parallel that of Commissioner Kinnison , leads to the same conclusion ; that an attack in great force is to be expected . " " Not exactly parallel ? " Kinnison demanded . " In what respects ? " " You do not seem to have considered the possibility , Commissioner , that the proposed assassination of First LensmanSamms could very well have been only the first step in a comprehensive operation . " " I did n't . . . and it could have been . So go ahead , Virge , with ... " The thought was never finished , for Samms had alreadygone ahead . Simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the group of Tellurians . Samms , intenselyserious , spoke aloud to his friend : " The Galactic Council is now assembled . Do you , RoderickK . Kinnison , promise to uphold , in as much as you conscientiously can and with all that in you lies , the authority of this Council throughout all space ? " " I promise . " " By virtue of the authority vested in me its president by the Galactic Council , I appoint you Port Admiral of the Galactic Patrol . My fellow councillors are now inducting the armed forces of their various solar systems into the Galactic Patrol . . . It will not take long . . . There , you may make your appointments and issue orders for the mobili-zation . " The two superdreadnaughts were now approaching the Hill . The Boise stayed " up on top " ; the Chicago went down . Kinnison , however , paid very little attention to the landing or to Samms ' disembarkation , and none whatever to the Chicago 's reascent into the high heavens . He knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cabin , he was busy . " All personnel of all armed forces just inducted into the Galactic Patrol , attention ! " He spoke into an ultra-wave microphone , the familiar parade-ground rasp very evident in his deep and resonant voice . " Kinnison of Tellus , Port Admiral , speaking . Each of you has taken oath to the Galactic Patrol ? " They had . " At ease . The organization chart already in your hands is made effective as of now . Enter in your logs the date and time . Promotions : Commodore Clayton of North America , Tellus ... " In his office at New York Spaceport Clayton came to attention and saluted crisply ; his eyes shining , his deeplyscarredface alight. " ... to be Admiral of the First Galactic Region . CommodoreSchweikert of Europe , Tellus ... " In Berlin a narrow-waisted , almost foppish-seeming man , with roached blond hair and blue eyes , bowed stiffly from the waist and saluted punctiliously. " . " . . to be Lieutenant-Admiral of the First Galactic Region . And so on , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solarian System ; a general and a lieutenant- general of the planet Sol Three .

Then the list of commodores upon other planets  --  Guindlos of Redland , Mars ; Sesseffsen of Thalleron , Venus ; Raymond of the Jovian Sub-System ; Newman of Alphacent ; Walters of Sirius ; vanMeeter of Valeria ; Adams of Procyon ; Roberts of Altair ; Barrtell of Fomalhout ; Armand of Vega ; and Coigne of Aldebaran  --  each of whom was actually the com- mander-in-chief of the armed forces of a world . Each of these was made general of his planet . " Except for lieutenant-commodores and up , who will tune their minds to me  --  dismissed ! " Kinnison stopped talk- ing and went onto his Lens . " That was for the record . I do n't need to tell you , fellows , how glad I am to be able to do this . You 're tops , all of you  --  I do n't know of anybody I 'd rather have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right back at you , chief ! " " Same to you , Rod ! " " Rocky Rod , Port Admiral ! " " Now we 're blasting ! " came a melange of thoughts . Those splendid men , with whom he had shared so much of danger and of stress , were all as jubilant as schoolboys . " But the thing that makes this possible may also make it necessary for us to go to work ; to earn your extra stars and my wheel . " Kinnison smothered the welter of thoughts and outlined the situation , concluding : " So you see it may turn out to be only a drill  --  but on the other hand , since the outfit is big enough to have built a war-fleet alone , if it wanted one , and since it may have had a lot of first-class help that none of us knows anything about , we may be in for the damndest battle that any of us ever saw . So comeBATTLE OF THE HILL 99prepared for anything . I am now going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commanding officers of all fleets , subfleets , and task-forces of the Galactic Patrol . Information . Subject , tactical problem ; defense of the Hill against a postulated Black Fleet of unknown size , strength , and composition ; of unknown nationality or origin ; coming from an unknown direction in space at an unknown time . " Kinnison to Admiral Clayton . Orders . Take over . I am relinquishing command of the Boise and the Chicago . " " Clayton to Port Admiral Kinnison . Orders received . Taking over . I am at the Chicago 's main starboard lock . I have instructed Ensign Masterson , the commanding officer of this gig , to wait ; that he is to take you down to the Hill . " " WHAT ? Of all the damned . . . " This was a thought , and unrecorded . " Sorry , Rod  --  I 'm sorry as hell , and I 'd like no end to have you along . " This , too , was a thought . " But that 's the way it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Admirals stay aground . I report to you , and you run ' things  --  in broad  --  by remote control . " " I see . " Kinnison then Lensed a fuming thought at Samms . " Alex could n't do this to me  --  and would n't  --  and knows damn well that I 'd burn him to a crisp if he had the guts to try it . So it 's your doing  --  what in hell 's the big idea ? " " Who 's being heroic now , Rod ? " Samms asked , quietly . " Use your brain . And then come down here , where you belong . " And Kinnison , after a long moment of rebellious thought and with as much grace as he could muster , came down . Down not only to the Patrol 's familiar offices , but down into the deepest crypts beneath them . He was glum enough , and bitter , at first : but he found much to do . Grand Fleet Headquarters  --  hisheadquarters  --  was being organized , and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three worlds were being devoted to the task of strength-100 FIRST LENSMAN BATTLE OF THE HILL 101ening the already extremely strong defenses of THE HILL . And in a very short time the plates of GFHQ showed that Admiral Clayton and Lieutenant-Admiral Schweikert were doing a very nice job . All of the really heavy stuff was of Earth , the Mother Planet , and was already in place ; as were the less numerous and much lighter contingents of Mars , of Venus , and of Jove . And the fleets of the outlying solar systems  --  cutters , scouts , and a few light cruisers  --  were neither maintaining fleet formationnor laying course for Sol . Instead , each individual vessel was blasting at maximum for the position in space in which it would form one unit of a formation englobing at a distance of light-years the entire Solarian System , and each of those hurtling hundreds of ships was literally combing all circumambient space with its furiously-driven detector beams . " Nice . " Kinnison turned to Samms , now beside him at the master plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After you get it made , what are you going to do with it in case nothing happens ? " Samms was still somewhat skeptical . " How long can you make a drill last ? " " Until all the ensigns have long gray whiskers if I have to , but do n't worry  --  if we have time to get the preliminary globe made I 'll be the surprisedest man in the system . " And Kinnison was not surprised ; before full englobementwas accomplished , a loud-speaker gave tongue . " Flagship Chicago to Grand Fleet Headquarters ! " it blatted , sharply . " The Black Fleet has been detected . RA twelve hours , declination plus twenty degrees , distance about thirty light-years ... " Kinnison started to say something ; then , by main force , shut himself up . He wanted intensely to take over , to tell the boys out there exactly what to do , but he could n't . He was now a Big Shot  --  damn the luck ! He could be and must be responsible for broad policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important decisions had been made , the actual work would have to be done by others . He didn'tlike it  --  but there it was . Those flashing thoughts took only an instant of time. " ... which is such extreme range that no estimate of strength or composition can be made at present . We will keep you informed . " " Acknowledge , " he ordered Randolph ; who , wearing now the five silver bars of major , was his Chief CommunicationsOfficer . " No instructions . " He turned to his plate . Clayton had n't had to be told to pull in his light stuff ; it was all pelting hell-for-leather for Sol and Tellus . Three general plans of battle had been mapped out by Staff . Each had its advantages  --  and its disadvantages . Operation Acorn  --  long distance  --  would be fought at , say , twelve light-years . It would keep everything , particularly the big stuff , away from the Hill , and would make automatics useless unless some got past , or unless the automatics were coming in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which cases what a God-awful shellacking the Hill would take ! He grinned wryly at Samms , who had been following his thought , and quoted : " A vast hemisphere of lambent violet flame , through which neither material substance nor destructive ray can pass . " " Well , that dedicatory statement , while perhaps a bit florid , was strictly true at the time  --  before the days of allotropic iron and of polycyclic drills . Now I 'll quote one : Nothing is permanent except change ' . " " Uh-huh , " and Kinnison returned to his thinking . OperationAdack . Middle distance . Uh-uh . He did n't like it any better now than he had before , even though some of the Big Brains of Staff thought it the ideal solution . A compromise . All of the disadvantages of both of the others , and none of the advantages of either . It still stunk , and unless the Black fleet had an utterly fantastic composition Operation Adack was out . And Virgil Samms , quietly smoking a cigarette , smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in favor of any sort of compromise. 102 . FIRST LENSMANThat left Operation Affick . Close up . It had three tremendousadvantages . First , the Hill 's own offensive weapons  --  as long as they lasted . Second , the new **25;5399;TOOLONG . Third , no sneak attack could be made without detection and interception . It had one tremendous disadvantage ; some stuff , and probably a lot of it , would get through . Automatics , robots , guided missiles equipped with superspeeddrives , with polycyclic drills , and with atomic warheadsstrong enough to shake the whole world . But with those new fields , shaking the world would n't be enough ; in order to get deep enough to reach Virgil Samms they would damn near have to destroy the world . Could anybody build a bomb that powefful ? He did n't think so . Earth technology was supreme throughout all known space ; of Earth technologists the North Americans were , and always had been , tops . Grant that the Black Fleet was , basically , North American . Grant further that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could spy-ray Adlington'sbrain and laboratories and shops  --  a tall order . Adlingtonhimself was several months away from a worldwrecker , unless he could put one a hundred miles down before detonation , which simply was not feasible . He turned to Samms . " It 'll be Affick , Virge , unless they 've got a composition that is radically different from anything I ever saw put into space . " " So ? I ca n't say that I am very much surprised . " The calm statement and the equally calm reply were beautifully characteristic of the two men . Kinnison had not asked , nor had Samms offered , advice . Kinnison , after weighingthe facts , made his decision . Samms , calmly certain that the decision was the best that could be made upon the data available , accepted it without question or criticism . " We 've still got a minute or two , " Kinnison remarked . " Do n't quite know what to make of their line of approach . Coma Berenices . I do n't know of anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detoured , though . " BATTLE OF THE HILL 103 " No , I do n't . " Samms frowned in thought . " Probably a detour . " " Check . " Kinnison turned to Randolph . " Tell them to report whatever they know ; we ca n't wait any . . . " As he was speaking the report came in . The Black Fleet was of more or less normal make-up ; considerably larger than the North American contingent , but decidedly inferior to the Patrol 's present Grand Fleet . Either three or four capital ships .. . " And we 've got six ! " Kinnison said , exultantly . " Our own two , Asia 's Himalaya , Africa 's Johannesburg , South America 's Bolivar , and Europe 's Europa . " . Battle cruisers and heavy cruisers , about in the usual proportions ; but an unusually high ratio of scouts and light cruisers . There were either two or three large ships which could not be classified definitely at that distance ; long-range observers were going out to study them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is to be Operation Affick , and for him to fly at it . " " Report continued , " the speaker came to life again . " There are three capital ships , apparently of approximately the Chicago class , but tear-drop-shaped instead of spherical . . . " " Ouch ! " Kinnison flashed a thought at Samms . " I do n't like that . They can both fight and run . " " ... The battle cruisers are also tear-drops . The small vessels are torpedo-shaped . There are three of the large ships , which we are still not able to classify definitely . They are spherical in shape , and very large , but do not seem to be either armed or screened , and are apparently carriers  --  possiblyof automatics . We are now making contact  --  off ! " Instead of looking at the plates before them , the two Lensmen went en rapport with Clayton , so that they could see everything he saw . The stupendous Cone of Battle had long since been formed ; the word to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer in every Patrol ship touched his stud in the same split second . And from the gargantuan mouth of the Cone there spewed a miles-104 FIRST LENSMANthick column of energy so raw , so stark , so incomprehensibly violent that it must have been seen to be even dimly appreciated . It simply can not be described . Its prototype , Triplanetary 's Cylinder of Annihilation , had been a highly effective weapon indeed . The offensive beams of the fish-shaped Nevian cruisers of the void were even more powerful . The Cleveland-Rodebush projectors , developed aboard the original Boise on the long Nevian way , were stronger still . The composite beam projected by this fleet of the Galactic Patrol , however , was the sublimation and quintessence of each of these , redesigned and redesigned by scientists and engineers of ever-increasing knowledge , rebuiltand rebuilt by technologists of ever-increasing skill . Capital ships and a few of the heaviest cruisers could mount screen generators able to carry that frightful load ; but every smaller ship caught in that semi-solid rod of **25;5426;TOOLONG fury simply flared into nothingness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as though precisely timed , which in all probability was the case  --  the ever-watchful observers picked up two items of fact which made the new Admiral of the First Galactic Region cut his almost irresistible weapon and break up his Cone of Battle after only a few seconds of action . One : those three enigmatic cargo scows had fallen apart before the beam reached them , and hundreds -- yes , thousands  --  of small objectshad hurtled radially outward , out well beyond the field of action of the Patrol 's beam , at a speed many times that of light . Two : Kinnison 's forebodings had been prophetic . A swarm of Blacks , all small  --  must have been hidden right on Earth somewhere !  --  were already darting at the Hill from the south . " Cease firing ! " Clayton rapped into his microphone . The dreadful beam expired . " Break cone formation ! Independentaction  --  light cruisers and scouts , get those bombs ! Heavy cruisers and battle cruisers , engage similar units of the Blacks , two to one if possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Himalaya , Number Two . Europa and Johannesburg , Number Three ! " BATTLE OF THE HILL 105Space was full of darting , flashing , madly warring ships . The three Black superdreadnaughts leaped forward as one . Their massed batteries of beams , precisely synchronized and aimed , lashed out as one at the nearest Patrol super heavy , the Boise . Under the vicious power of that beautifully-timed thrust that warship 's first , second , and third screens , her very wall-shield , flared through the spectrum and into the black . Her Chief Pilot , however , was fast  --  very fast  --  and he had a fraction of a second in which to work . Thus , practically in the instant of her wall-shield 's failure , she went free ; and while she was holed badly and put out of action , she was not blown out of space . In fact , it was learned later that she lost only forty men . The Blacks were not as fortunate . The Chicago , now without a partner , joined beams with the Bolivar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short half-second later , with her other two sister-ships against Number Three . And in that very short space of time two Black super-dreadnaughtsceased utterly to be . But also , in that scant second of time , Black Number One had all but disappeared ! Her canny commander , with no stomach at all for odds of five to one against , had ordered flight at max ; she was already one-sixtieth of a light-year  --  about one hundred thousand million miles  --  away from the Earth and was devoting her every energy to the accumulation of still more distance . " Bolivar ! Himalaya ! " Clayton barked savagely . " Get him ! " He wanted intensely to join the chase , but he could n't . He had to stay here . And he did n't have time even to swear . Instead , without a break , the words tripping over each other against his teeth : " Chicago ! Johannesburg ! Europa ! Act at will against heaviest craft left . Blast ' em down ! " He gritted his teeth . The scouts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outnumbered three to one  --  Christ , what a lot of stuff was getting through ! The Blacks would n't last long , between the Hill and the heavies ... but maybe long enough , at that  --  the Patrol globe was leaking like a sieve ! He voiced a couple of bursts of deep-spaceBATTLE OF THE HILL 107Port Admiral Kinnison , shortly after directing the foregoingthought , leaned back in his chair and smiled . The battle was practically over . The Hill had come through . The Rodebush-Bergenholm fields had held her together through the most God-awful session of saturation atomic bombing that any world had ever seen or that the mind of man had ever conceived . And the counter-forces had kept the interior rock from flowing like water . So far , so good . Her original armor was gone . Converted into ... what ? For hundreds of feet inward from the surface she was hotter than the reacting slugs of the Hanfords . Delousing her would be a project , not an operation ; millions of cubic yards of material would have to be hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred years ; - but what of that ? Bergenholm had said that the fields would tend to preventthe radioactives from spreading , as they otherwise would  --  and Virgil Samrvts was still safe ! " Virge , my boy , come along . " He took the First Lensmanby his good arm and lifted him out of his chair . " Old Doctor Kinnison 's peerless prescription for you and me is a big , thick , juicy , porterhouse steak . " 106 FIRST LENSMANprofanity and , although he was almost afraid to look , sneaked a quick peek to see how much was left of the Hill . He looked  --  and stopped swearing in the middle of a four-letter Anglo-Saxon word . What he saw simply did not make sense . Those Black bombs should have peeled the armor off of that mountain like the skin off of a nectarine and scattered it from the Pacific to the Mississippi . By now there should be a hole a mile deep where the Hill had been . But there was n't . The Hill was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see very well because of the worse-than-incandescent radiance of the practically continuous , sense-battering , worldshakingatomic detonations  --  but the Hill was still there ! And as he stared , chilled and shaken , at that indescribablyterrific spectacle , a Black cruiser , holed and helpless , fell toward that armored mountain with an acceleration starkly impossible to credit . And when it struck it did not penetrate , and splash , and crater , as it should have done . Instead , it simply spread out , in a thin layer , over an acre or so of the fortress ' steep and apparently still armored sur-face ! " You saw that , Alex ? Good . Otherwise you could scarcely believe it , " came Kinnison 's silent voice . " Tell all our ships to stay away . There 's a force of over a hundred thousand G 's acting in a direction normal to every point of our surface . The boys are giving it all the decrement they can  --  somewhere between distance cube and fourth power  --  but even so it 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not having much luck catching Mr. Black , are they ? " " Why , I do n't know . I 'll check . . . No , sir , they are n't . They report that they are losing ground and will soon lose trace . " " I was afraid so , from that shape . Rodebush was about the only one who saw it coming . . . well , we 'll have to redesignand rebuild . . . " EXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL 109CHAPTER8Examination Zwilnik , OralHAT MURDEROUS ATTACK UPONVirgil Samms , and its countering by those new super-lawmen , the Lensmen , and by an entire task force of the North AmericanArmed Forces , was news of Civilization-wide importance . As such , it filled every channel of Universal Telenews for an hour . Then , in stunning and crescendo succession , came the staccato reports of the creation of the Galactic Patrol , the mobilization  --  allegedly for maneuvers !  --  of Galactic Patrol 's Grand Fleet , and the ultimately desperate and all-too-nearly successful attack upon The Hill . " Just a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll see something that nobody ever saw before and that nobody will ever see again . We 're getting in as close as the Law will let us . " The eyes of Telenews ' ace reporter and the telephoto lens of his cameraman stared down from a scooter at the furiously smoking , sputteringly incandescent surface of Triplanetary'sancient citadel ; while upon dozens of worlds thousands of millions of people packed themselves tighter and tighter around tens of millions of visiplates and loudspeakersin order to see and to hear the tremendous news . " There it is , folks , look at it  --  the only really impregnablefortress ever built by man ! A good many of our expertshad it written off as obsolete , long ago , but it seemsthese Lensmen had something up their sleeves besides their arms , heh-heh ! And speaking of Lensmen , they have n't been throwing their weight around , so most of us have n't noticed them very much , but this reporter wants to go on record right now as saying there must be a lot more to the Lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gone to all that trouble and expense , to say nothing of the tremendous loss of life , just to kill the Chief Lensman , which seems to have been what they were after . " We told you a few minutes ago , you know , that every Continent of Civilization sent official messages denying most emphatically any connection with this outrage . It 's still a mystery , folks ; in fact , it is getting more and more mysteriousall the time . Not one single man of the Black Fleet was taken alive ! Not even in the ships that were only holed  --  they blew themselves up ! And there were no uniforms or books or anything of the kind to be found in any of the wrecks  --  no identification whatever ! " And now for the scoop of all time ! Universal Telenews has obtained permission to interview the two top Lensmen , both of whom you all know  --  Virgil Samms and Rod the Rock ' Kinnison  --  personally for this beam . We are now going down , by remote control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in The Hill itself . Here ' we are . Now , if you will step just a little closer to the ike , please , Mr. Samms ; or should I say ... ? " " You should say First Lensman Samms ' , " Kinnison said bruskly . " Oh , yes , First Lensman Samms . Thank you , Mr. Kinnison . Now , First Lensrnan Samms , our clients all want to know all about the Lens . We all know what it does , but what , really , is it ? Who invented it ? How does it work ? " Kinnison started to say something , but Sarnrns silenced him with a thought . " I will answer those questions by asking you one . " Samms smiled disarmingly . " Do you remember what happenedbecause the pirates learned to duplicate the golden meteor of the Triplanetary Service ? " 1 10 FIRST LENSMAN EXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL . 111 " Oh , I see . " The Telenews ace , although brash and not at all thin-skinned , was quick on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top Secret . Very much so , " Samms confirmed , " and we are going to keep some things about the Lens secret as long as we possibly can . " " Fair enough . Sorry folks , but you will agree that they 're right on that . Well , then , Mr. Samms , who do you think it was that tried to kill you , and where do you think the Black Fleet came from ? " " I have no idea , " Samms said , slowly and thoughtfully . " No . No idea whatever . " " What ? Are you sure of that ? Are n't you holding back maybe just a little bit of a suspicion , for diplomatic reasons ? " " I am holding nothing back ; and through my Lens I can make you certain of the fact . Lensed thoughts come from the mind itself , direct , not through such voluntary muscles as the tongue . The mind does not lie  --  even such lies as you call diplomacy ' . " The Lensman demonstrated and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which fact knocked me speechless for a second or two  --  which is quite a feat in itself . Now , Mr. Samms , one last question . What is all this Lens stuff really about ? What are all you Lensmen  --  the Galactic Council and so on  --  really up to ? What do you expect to get out of it ? And why would anybody want to make such an all-out effort to get rid of you ? And give it to me on the Lens , please , if you can do it and talk at the same time  --  that was a wonderful sensation , folks , of getting the dope straight and knowing that it was straight . " " I can and will answer both by voice and by Lens . Our basic purpose is . . . " and he quoted verbatim the resounding sentences which Mentor had impressed so ineradicably upon his mind . " You know how little happiness , how little real well-being , there is upon any world today . We propose to increase both . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ourselves , the satisfaction felt by any good workman doing the job for which he is best fitted and inwhich he takes pride . As to why anyone should want to kill me , the logical explanation would seem to be that some group or organization or race , opposed to that for which we Lensmenstand , decided to do away with us and started with me . " " Thank you , Mr. Samms . I am sure that we all enjoyed this interview very much . Now , folks , you all know Rocky Rod ' , Rod the Rock ' , Kinnison . . just a little closer , please . .. thank you . I do n't suppose you have any suspicions , either , any more than ... " " I certainly have ! " Kinnison barked , so savagely that five hundred million people jumped as one . " How do you want it ; voice , or Lens , or both ? " Then , on the Lens : " Think it over , son , because I suspect everybody ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's star reporter was shaken by the quiet but deadly fury of the big Lensman 's thought , but he rallied so quickly that his hesitation was barely noticeable . " Your Lensed thought to me was that you suspect everybody , Mr. Kinnison ? " " Just that . Everybody . I suspect every continental government of every world we know , including that of North America of Tellus . I suspect political parties and organized minorities . I suspect pressure groups . I suspect capital and I suspect labor . I suspect an organization of criminals . I suspect nations and races and worlds that no one of us has as yet heard of  --  not even you , the top-drawer newshawk of the universe . " " But you have nothing concrete to go on , I take it ? " " If I did have , do you think I 'd be standing here talking to you ? " * * * * *  --  *First Lensman Samms sat in his private quarters and thought . Lensman Dronvire of Rigel Four stood behind him and helped him think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began a comprehensive program of investigation , consolidation , expansion , redesigning , and rebuilding . Virgilia Samms went to a party practically every night. 112 FIRST LENSMAN EXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL 113She danced , she flirted , she talked . How she talked ! Meaninglesssmall talk for the most part  --  but interspersed with artless questions and comments which , while they perhaps did not put her partner of the moment completely at ease , nevertheless did not quite excite suspicion . Conway Costigan , Lens under sleeve , undisguised but inconspicuous , rode the ether-lanes ; observing minutely and reporting fully . Jack Kinnison piloted and navigated and computed for his friend and boatmate : Mason Northrop ; who , completely surrounded by breadboardhookups of new and ever-more-fantastic complexity , listened and looked ; listened and tuned ; listened and rebuilt ; listened and  --  finally  --  took bearings and bearings and bearingswith his ultra-sensitive loops . DalNalten and Knobos , with dozens of able helpers , combed the records of three worlds in a search which producedas a by-product a monumental " who 's who " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stack , into the most versatile and most accomplished machines known to the statisticians of the age . And Dr. Nets Bergenholm , abandoning temporarily his regular line of work , devoted his peculiar talents to a highly abstruse research in the closely allied field of organic chemistry . The walls of Virgil Samms ' quarters became covered with charts , diagrams , and figures . Tabulations and condensationspiled up on his desk and overflowed into baskets upon the floor . Until : . " Lensman Olmstead , of Alphacent , sir , " his secretary announced . " Good ! Send him in , please . " The stranger entered . The two men , after staring intentlyat each other for half a minute , smiled and shook hands vigorously . Except for the fact that the newcomer 's hair was brown , they were practically identical ! " I 'm certainly glad to see you , George . Bergenholm passed you , of course ? " " Yes . He says that he can match your hair to mine , even the individual white ones . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Married ? " Samms ' mind leaped ahead to possible complications . " Widower , same as you . And ... " " Just a minute  --  going over this once will be enough . " He Lensed call after call . Lensmen in various parts of space became en rapport with him and thus with each other . " Lensmen  --  especially you , Rod  --  George Olmstead is here , and his brother Ray is available . I am going to work . " " I still do n't like it ! " Kinnison protested . " It 's too dangerous . I told the Universe I was going to keep you covered , and I meant it ! " " That 's what makes it perfectly safe . That is , if Bergenholmis sure that the duplication is close enough ... " " I am sure . " Bergenholm 's deeply resonant pseudovoiceleft no doubt at all in any one of the linked minds . " The substitution will not be detected . " " ... and that nobody knows , George , or even suspects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of that . " Olmstead laughed quietly . " Also , nobody except us and your secretary knows that I am here . For a good many years I have made a specialty of that sort of thing . Photos , fingerprints , and so on have all been taken care of . " " Good . I simply can not work efficiently here , " Samms expressed what all knew to be the simple truth . " Dronvire is a much better analyst-synthesist than I am ; as soon as any significant correlation is possible he will know it . We have learned that the Towne-Morgan crowd , Mackenzie Power , Ossmen Industries , and Interstellar Spaceways are all tied in together , and that thionite is involved , but we have not been able to get any further . There is a slight correlation  --  barely significant  --  between deaths from thionite and the arrival in the Solarian System of certain Spaceways liners . The fact that certain officials of the Earth-Screen Service have been and are spending considerably more than they earn114 FIRST LENSMANsets up a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from space-ships to land illegally . These smugglers carry contraband , which may or may not be thionite . In short , we lack fundamental data in every department , and it is high time for me to begin doing my share in getting it . " " I do n't check you , Virge . " None of the Kinnisons ever did give up without a struggle . " Olmstead is a mighty smooth worker , and you are our prime coordinator . Why not let him keep up the counter-espionage  --  do the job you were figuring on doing yourself  --  and you stay here and boss it ? " " I have thought of that , a great deal , and have . . . " " Because Olmstead can not do it , " a hitherto silent mind cut in , decisively . " I , Rularion of North Polar Jupiter , say so . There are psychological factors involved . The ability to separate and to evaluate the constituent elements of a complexsituation ; the ability to make correct decisions without hesitation ; as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectively could be called power of mind . How say you , Bergenholm of Tellus ? For I have perceived in you a mind approximating in some respects the philosophical and psychological depth of my own . " This outrageouslyegotistical declaration was , to the Jovian , a simple statement of an equally simple truth , and Bergenholm acceptedit as such . " I agree . Olmstead probably could not succeed . " " Well , then , can Samms ? " Kinnison demanded . " Who knows ? " came Bergenholm 's mental shrug , andsimultaneously : " Nobody knows whether I can or not , but I am going to try , " and Samms ended  --  almost  --  the argument by asking Bergenholm and a couple of other Lensmen to come into his office and by taking off his Lens . " And that 's another thing I do n't like . " Kinnison offeredone last objection . " Without your Lens , anything can happen to you . " " Oh , I wo n't have to be without it very long . And besides , Virgilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZWILNIK , ORAL 115can work better  --  sometimes  --  without a Lens . " The Lensmen came in and , in a surprisingly short time , went out . A few minutes later , two Lensmen strolled out of Samms ' inner office into the outer one . " Good-bye , George , " the red-headed man said aloud , " and good luck . " " Same to you , Chief , " and the brown-haired one strode out . Norma the secretary was a smart girl , and observant . In her position , she had to be . Her eyes followed the man out , then scanned the Lensman from toe to crown . " I 've never seen anything like it , Mr. Samms , " she remarkedthen . " Except for the difference in coloring , and a sort of . . . well , stoopiness . . . he could be your identical twin . You two must have had a common ancestor  --  or several  --  nottoo far back , did n't you ? " " We certainly did . Quadruple second cousins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other for years , but this is the first time we have met . " " Quadruple second cousins ? What does that mean ? How come ? " " Well , say that once upon a time there were two men named Albert and Chester . . . " " What ? Not two Irishmen named Pat and Mike ? You 're slipping , boss . " The girl smiled roguishly . During rush hours she was always the fast , cool , efficient secretary , but in moments of ease such persiflage as this was the usual thing in the First Lensman 's private office . " Not at all up to your usual form . " " Merely because I am speaking now as a genealogist , not as a raconteur . But to continue , we will say that Chester and Albert had four children apiece , two boys and two girls , two pairs of identical twins , each . And when they grew up  --  half way up , that is ... " " Do n't tell me that we are going to suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly . Why not ? " " Well , it would be stretching the laws of probability all116 FIRST LENSMAN EXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL 117out of shape . But go ahead  --  I can see what 's coming , I think . " " Each of those couples had one , and only one , child . We will call those children Jim Samms and Sally Olmstead ; John Olmstead and Irene Samms . " The girl 's levity disappeared . " James Alexander Samms and Sarah Olmstead Samms . Your parents . I did n't see what was coming , after all . This George Olmstead ; then , is your . . . " Whatever it is , yes . I ca n't name it , either  --  maybe you had better call Genealogy some day and find out . But it 's no wonder we look alike . And there are three of us , not two  --  George has an identical twin brother . " The red-haired Lensman stepped back into the inner office , shut the door , and Lensed a thought at Virgil Samms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five solid minutes , practically leaning on her desk , and she did n't tumble ! And if this wig of Bergenholm 's fooled her so completely , the job he did on you would fool anybody ! " " Fine ! I 've done a little testing myself , on the keenest men I know , without a trace of recognition so far . " His last lingering doubt resolved , Samms boarded the ponderous , radiation-proof , neutron-proof shuttle-scow which was the only possible means of entering or leaving the Hill . A fast cruiser whisked him to Nampa , where Olmstead 's " accidentally " damaged transcontinental transport was being repaired , and from which city Olmstead had been gone so briefly that no one had missed him . He occupied Olmstead'sspace ; he surrendered the remainder of Olmstead 's ticket . He reached New York . He took a ' copter to Senator Morgan 's office . He was escorted into the private office of Herkimer Herkimer Third . " Olmstead . Of Alphacent . " " Yes ? " Herkimer 's hand moved , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here . " The Lensman dropped an envelope upon the desk in such fashion that it came to rest within an inch of the hand . " Prints . Here . " Samms made prints . " Wash your hands , over there . " Herkimer pressed a button . " Check all these prints , against each other and the files . Check the two halves of the torn sheet , fiber to fiber . " He turned to the Lensless Lensman , now standing quietly before his desk . " Routine ; a formality , in your case , but necessary . " " Of course . " Then for long seconds the two hard men stared into the hard depths of each other 's eyes . " You may do , Olmstead . We have had very good reportsof you . But you have never been in thionite ? " " No . I have never even seen any . " " What do you want to get into it for ? " " Your scouts sounded me out ; what did they tell you ? The usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to where I can do myself and the organization some good . " " Yourself first , the organization second ? " " What else ? ' Why should I be different from the rest of you ? " This time the locked eyes held longer ; one pair smoldering , the other gold-flecked , tawny ice . " Why , indeed ? " Herkimer smiled thinly . " We do not advertise it , however . " " Outside , I would n't , either ; but here I 'm laying my cards flat on the table . " " I see . You will do , Olmstead , if you live . There 's a test , you know . " " They told me there would be . " " Well , are n't you curious to know what it is ? " " Not particularly . You passed it , did n't you ? " " What do you mean by that crack ? " Herkimer leaped to his feet ; his eyes , smoldering before , now ablaze . " Exactly what I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it anything you please . " Samms ' voice was as cold as were his eyes . " You picked me out because of what I am . Did you think that moving upstairs would make a bootlickerout of me ? " 118 FIRST LENSMAN EXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL 119 " Not at all . " Herkimer sat down and took from a drawer two small , transparent , vaguely capsule-like tubes , each containing a few particles of purple dust . " You know what this is ? " " I can guess . " " Each of these is a good , heavy jolt ; about all that a strong man with a strong heart can stand . Sit down . Here is one dose . Pull the cover , stick the capsule up one nostril , squeeze the ejector , and sniff . If you can leave this other dose sitting here on the desk you will live , and thus pass the test . If you ca n't , you die . " Samms sat , and pulled , and squeezed , and sniffed . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched themselves into fists , the tight-stretched tendons standing boldly out . His face turned white . His eyes jammed themselves shut ; his jaw-muscles sprang into bands and lumps as they clamped his teeth hard together . Every voluntary muscle in his body went into a rigor as extreme as that of death itself . His heart pounded ; his breathing became stertorous . This was the dreadful " muscle-lock " so uniquely characteristic of thionite ; the frenzied immobility of the ultimatelypassionate satisfaction of every desire . The Galactic Patrol became for him an actuality ; a force for good pervading all the worlds of all the galaxies of all the universes of all existing space-time continua . He knew what the Lens was , and why . He understood time and space . He knew the absolute beginning and the ultimate end . He also saw things and did things over which it is best to draw a kindly veil , for every desire  --  mental or physical , open or sternly suppressed , noble or base  --  that Virgil Samms had ever had was being completely satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the verge of death through sheer ecstasy , a door opened and Senator Morgan entered the room . Herkimer started , almostimperceptibly , as he turned  --  had there been , or not , an **26;5453;TOOLONG flash of guilt in those now completely clear and frank brown eyes ? " Hi , Chief ; come in and sit down . Glad to see you  --  this is not exactly my idea of fun . " " No ? When did you stop being a sadist ? " The senator sat down beside his minion 's desk , the fingertips of his left hand began soundlessly to drum . " You would n't have , by any chance , been considering the idea of ... ? " He paused significantly . " What an idea ! " Herkimer 's act  --  if it was an act  --  was flawless . " He 's too good a man to waste . " " I know it , but you did n't act as though you did . I 've never seen you come out such a poor second in an interview ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with just what kind of a tiger he was-that 's why he was selected for this job . And it would have been so easy to give him just a wee bit more . " " That 's preposterous , Chief , and you know it . " " Do I ? However , it could n't have been jealousy , because he is n't being considered for your job . He wo n't be over you , and there 's plenty of room for everybody . What was the matter ? Your bloodthirstiness would n't have taken you that far , under these circumstances . Come clean , Herk-imer . " " Okay  --  I hate the whole damned family ! " Herkimer burst out , viciously . " I see . That adds up . " Morgan 's face cleared , his fingersbecame motionless . " You ca n't make the Samms wench and are n't in position to skin her alive , so you get allergic to all her relatives . That adds up , but let me tell you something . " His quiet , level voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Keep your love life out of business and keep that sadistic streak under control . Do n't let anything like this happen again . " " I wo n't , Chief . I got off the beam  --  but he made me so damn mad ! " " Certainly . That 's exactly what he was trying to do . Elementary . If he could make you look small it would make120 FIRST LENSMAN EXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL 121him look big , and he just about did . But watch now , he 's coming to . " Samms ' muscles relaxed . He opened his eyes groggily ; then , as a wave of humiliated realization swept over his consciousness , he closed them again and shuddered . He had always thought himself pretty much of a man ; how could he possibly have descended to such nauseous depths of depravity , of turpitude , of sheer moral degradation ? And yet every cell of his being was shrieking its demand for more ; his mind and his substance alike were permeated by an overmastering craving to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so outrageously enjoyed . There was another good jolt lying right there on the desk in front of him , even though thionite-sniffers always saw to it that no more of the drug could be obtained without considerable physical exertion ; which exertion would bring them to their senses . If he took that jolt it would kill him . What of it ? What was death ? What good was life , except to enjoy such thrills as he had just had and was about to have again ? And besides , thionite could n't kill him . He was a super-man ; he had just proved it ! He straightened up and reached for the capsule ; and that effort , small as it was , was enough to bring First LensmanVirgil Samms back under control . The craving , however , did not decrease . Rather , it increased . Months were to pass before he could think of thionite , or even of the color purple , without a spasmodic catching of the breath and a tightening of every muscle . Years were to pass before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark recesses of his own mind . Nevertheless , from the store of whatever it was that made him what he was , Virgil Samms drew strength . Thumb and forefinger touched the capsule , but instead of picking it up , he pushed it across the desk toward Herkimer . " Put it away , bub . One whiff of that stuff will last me for life . " He stared unfathomably at the secretary , then turned to Morgan and nodded . " After all , he did not say that he ever passed this or any other test . He just didn'tcontradict me when I said it . " With a visible effort Herkimer remained silent , but Morgan did not . " You talk too much , Olmstead . Can you stand up yet ? " Gripping the desk with both hands , Samms heaved himself to his feet . The room was spinning and gyrating ; every individual thing in it was moving in a different and impossible orbit ; his already splintered skull threatened more and more violently to emulate a fragmentation bomb ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vision . He wrenched one hand free , then the other  --  and collapsed back into the chair . " Not yet  --  quite , " he admitted , through stiff lips . Although he was careful not to show it , Morgan was amazed  --  not that the man had collapsed , but that he had been able so soon to lift himself even an inch . " Tiger " was not the word ; this Olmstead must be seven-eighths dinosaur . " It takes a few minutes ; longer for some , not so long for others , " Morgan said , blandly . " But what makes you think Herkimer here never took one of the same ? " " Huh ? " Again two pairs of eyes locked and held ; and this time the duel was longer and more pregnant . " What do you think ? How do you suppose I lived to get as old as I am now ? By being dumb ? " Morgan unwrapped a Venerian cigar , settled it comfortablybetween his teeth , lit it , and drew three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An analytical mind , " he said , evenly , and  --  apparently  --  irrelevantly . " Let 's skip Herkimer for the moment . Try your hand on me . " " Why not ? From what we hear out in the field , you have always been in the upper brackets , so you probably never had to prove that you could take it or let it alone . My guess would be , though , that you could . " " The good old oil , eh ? " Morgan allowed his face and voice to register a modicum , precisely metered , of contempt . " How to get along in the world ; Lesson One : Butter up the Boss . " 122 FIRST LENSMAN " Nice try , Senator , but I 'll have to score you a clean miss . " Samms , now back almost to normal , grinned companionably . " We both know that if I were still in the kindergarten I would n't be here now . " " I 'll let that one pass -- -this time . " Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cringe , but this Olmsteadwas not the cringing type . " Do n't do it again . It might not be safe . " " Oh , it would be safe enough  --  for today , at least . There are two factors which you are very carefully ignoring . First , I have n't accepted the job yet . " " Are you innocent enough to think you 'll get out of this building alive if I do n't accept you ? " " If you want to call it innocence , yes . Oh , I know you 've got gunnies all over the place , but they do n't mean a thing . " " No ? " Morgan 's voice was silkily venemous . " No . " Olmstead was completely unimpressed . " Put yourself in my place . You know I 've been around a long time ; and not just around my mother . I was weaned quite a number of years ago . " " I see . You do n't scare worth a damn . A point . And you are testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . I 'm beginning to like you , George . I think I know what your second point is , but let 's have it , just for the record . " " I 'm sure you do . Any man , to be my boss , has got to be at least as good a man as I am . Otherwise I take his job away from him . " " Fair enough . By God , I do like you , Olmstead ! " Morgan , his big face wreathed in smiles , got up , strode over , and shook hands vigorously ; and Samms , scan as he would , could not even hazard a guess as to how much  --  if any  --  of this enthusiasm was real . " Do you want the job ? And when can you go to work ? " " Yes , sir . Two hours ago , sir . " " That 's fine ! " Morgan boomed . Although he did not comment upon it , he noticed and understood the , change inEXAMINATION ZWILNIK , ORAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job is or how much it pays ? " " Neither is important , sir , at the moment . " Samms , who had got up easily enough to shake hands , now shook his head experimentally . Nothing rattled . Good  --  he was in pretty good shape already . " As to the job , I can either do it or find out why it ca n't be done . As to pay , I 've heard you called a lot of things , but piker ' was never one of them . " " Very well . I predict that you will go far . " Morgan again shook the Lensman 's hand ; and again Samms could not evaluate the Senator 's sincerity . " Tuesday afternoon . New York Spaceport . Spaceship Virgin Queen . Report to Captain Willoughby in the dock office at fourteen hundred hours . Stop at the cashier 's office on your way out . Good-bye . " CHAPTER9TrencoIRACY WAS RIFE . THERE WASno suspicion , however , nor would there be for many years , that there was anything of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Captain Kidd of space ; and even if he were actually connected with Galactic Spaceways , that fact would not be surprising . Such relationships had always existed ; the most ferocious and dreaded pirates of the ancient world worked in full partnership with the First Families of that world . Virgil Samms was thinking of pirates and of piracy when he left Senator Morgan 's office . He was still thinking of them while he was reporting to Roderick Kinnison . Hence : " But that 's enough about this stuff and me , Rod . Bring me up to date on Operation Boskone . " " Branching out no end . Your guess was right that Spaceways ' losses to pirates are probably phony . But it was n't the known attacks  --  that is , those cases in which the ship was found , later , with some or most of the personnel alive  --  that gave us the real information . They were all pretty much alike . But when we studied the total disappearanceswe really hit the jack-pot . " " That does n't sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1251 " You 'd better , since it goes farther than even you suspected . It was no trouble at all to get the passenger lists and the names of the crews of the independent ships that were lost without a trace . Their relatives and friends  --  we concentrated mostly on wives  --  could be located , except for the usual few who moved around so much that they got lost . Spacemen average young , you know , and their wives are still younger . Well , these young women got jobs , most of them remarried , and so on . In short , normal . " " And in the case of Spaceways , not normal ? " " Decidedly not . In the first place , you 'd be amazed at how little publication was ever done of passenger lists , and apparently crew lists were not published at all . No use going into detail as to how we got the stuff , but we got it . However , nine tenths of the wives had disappeared , and none had remarried . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when their husbands were alive , whether they ever saw them again or not . But the big break was  --  you remember the disappearance of that girls ' - school cruise ship ? " " Of course . It made a lot of noise . " " An interesting point in connection with that cruise is that two days before the ship blasted off the school was robbed . The vault was opened with thermite and the whole Administration Building burned to the ground . All the school 's records were destroyed . Thus , the list of missing had to be made up from statements made by friends , relatives , and what not . " " I remember something of the kind . My impression was , though , that the space-ship company furnished . . . Oh ! " The tone of Samms ' thought altered sharply . " That was Spaceways , under cover ? " " Definitely . Our best guess is that there were quite a few shiploads of women disappeared about that time , instead of one . Austine 's College had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the extras , not the regulars , who went on that cruise ; the ones who figured it would be more convenient to disappear in space than to become ordinarymissing persons . " " But Rod ! That would mean . . . but where ? " " It means just that . And finding out where ' will run into a project . There are over two thousand million suns in this galaxy , and the best estimate is that there are more than that many planets habitable by beings more or less humanin type . You know how much of the galaxy has been explored and how fast the work of exploring the rest of it is going . Your guess is just as good as mine as to where those spacemen and engineers and their wives and girl-friends are now . I am sure , though , of four things ; none of which we can even begin to prove . One ; they did n't die in space . Two ; they landed on a comfortable and very well equipped Tellurianplanet . Three ; they built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill . " " Murgatroyd , do you suppose ? " Although surprised by Kinnison 's tremendous report , Samms was not dismayed . " No idea . No data  --  yet . " " And they 'll keep on building , " Samms said . " They had a fleet much larger than the one they expected to meet . Now they 'll build one larger than all our combined forces . And since the politicians will always know what we are doing .. . or it might be . . . I wonder ... ? " " You can stop wondering . " Kinnison grinned savagely . " What do you mean ? " " Just what you were going to think about . You know the edge of the galaxy closest to Tellus , where that big rift cuts in ? " " Yes . " " Across that rift , where it wo n't be surveyed for a thousand years , there 's a planet that could be Earth 's twin sister . No atomic energy , no space-drive , but heavily industrialized and anxious to welcome us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Lensmen know anything about it . Two friends of Dronvire 's  --  smart , smooth operators  --  are in charge . It 's going to be the Navy Yard of the Galactic Patrol . " " But Rod . . . " Samms began to protest , his mind leapingahead to the numberless problems , the tremendous difficulties , inherent in the program which his friend had outlinedso briefly . " Forget it , Virge ! " Kinnison cut in . " It wo n't be easy , of course , but we can do anything they can do , and do it better . You can go calmly ahead with your own chores , knowing that when  --  and notice that I say when ' , notwe need it we 'll have a fleet up our sleeves that will make the official one look like a task force . But I see you 're at the rendevous , and there 's Jill . Tell her hi ' for me . And as the Vegians say  --  Tail high , brother ! ' " Samms was in the hotel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jill Samms were approaching . The girl reached him first . " You had no trouble in recognizing me , then , my dear ? " " None at all , Uncle George . " She kissed him perfunctorily , the bell hops faded away . " So nice to see you  --  I'veheard so much about you . The Marine Room , you said ? " " Yes . I reserved a table . " And in that famous restaurant , in the unequalled privacy of the city 's noisiest and most crowded night spot , they drank sparingly ; ate not-so-sparingly ; and talked not sparingly at all . " It 's perfectly safe here , you think ? " Jill asked first . " Perfectly . A super-sensitive microphone could n't hear anything , and its so dark that a lip-reader , even if he could read us , would need a pair of twelve-inch night-glasses . " " Goody ! They did a marvelous job , Dad . If it were n't for your ... well , your personality , I would n't recognize you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " Absolutely . " " Then we 'll get down to business . You , Knobos , and DalNalten all have keen and powerful minds . You ca n't all be wrong . Spaceways , then , is tied in with both the TowneMorgangang and with thionite . The logical extension of that  --  Dal certainly thought of it , even though he did n't men-128 FIRST LENSMAN TRENCO 129tion it  --  would be . . . " Samms paused . " Check . That the notorious Murgatroyd , instead of being just another pirate chief , is really working for Space- ways and belongs to the Towne-Morgan-Isaacson gang . But dad  --  what an idea ! Can things be that rotten , really ? " " They may be worse than that . Now the next thing . Who , in your opinion , is the real boss ? " " Well , it certainly is not Herkimer Herkimer Third . " Jill ticked him off on a pink forefinger . She had been asked for an opinion ; she set out to give it without apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct the affairs of a hot-dog staid . Nor is it Clander . He is n't even a little fish ; he 's scarcely a minnow . Equally certainly it is neither the Venerian nor the Martian . They may run planetary affairs , but nothing bigger . I have n't met Murgatroyd , of course , but I have had several evaluations and he does not rate up with Towne . And Big Jim  --  and this surprised me as much as it will you  --  is almost certainly not the prime mover . " She looked at him questioningly . " That would have surprised me tremendously yesterday ; but after today  --  I 'll tell you about that presently  --  it does n't . " " I 'm glad of that . I expected an argument , and I have been inclined to question the validity of my own results , since they do not agree with common knowledge  --  or , rather , what is supposed to be knowledge . That leaves Isaacson and Senator Morgan . " Jill frowned in perplexity ; seemed , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big man . Able . Well-informed . Extremely capable . A top-notch ex- ecutive . Not only is , would have to be , to run Spaceways . On the other hand , I have always thought that Morgan was nothing but a windbag . . . " Jill stopped talking ; left the thought hanging in air . " So did I  --  until today , " Samms agreed grimly . " I thought that he was simply an unusually corrupt , greedy , rabble-rousing politician . Our estimates of him may have to be changed very radically . " Samms ' mind raced . From two entirely different angles of approach , Jill and he had arrived at the same conclusion . But , if Morgan were really the Big Shot , would he have deigned to interview personally such small fry as Olmstead ? Or was Olmstead 's job of more importance than he , Samms , had supposed ? " I 've got a dozen more things to check with you , " he went on , almost without a pause , " but since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would affect your judgment , I had better tell you about what happened today ... " * * * * *Tuesday came , and hour fourteen hundred ; and Samms strode into an office . There was a big , clean desk ; a wiry , intense , gray-haired man . " Captain Willoughby ? " " Yes . " " George Olmstead reporting . " " Fourth Officer . " The captain punched a button ; the heavy , sound-proof door closed itself and locked . " Fourth Officer ? New rank , eh ? What does the ticket cover ? " " New , and special . Here 's the articles ; read it and sign it . " He did not add " or else " , it was not necessary . It was clearly evident that Captain Willoughby , never garrulous , intended to be particularly reticent with his new subordinate . Samms read . " . . . Fourth Officer . . . shall ... no duties or responsibilities in the operation or maintenance of said space-ship . . . cargo . . . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smote his eyes : " when in command of a detail outside the hull of said space-ship he shall enforce , by the infliction of death or such other penalty as he deems fit ... " The Lensman was rocked to the heels , but did not show it . Instead , he took the captain 's pen  --  his own , as far as Willoughby was concerned , could have been filled with vanishingink  --  and wrote George Olmstead 's name in George Olmstead 's bold , flowing script . Willoughby then took him aboard the good ship Virgin130 FIRST LENSMAN TRENCO 131Queen and led him to his cabin . " Here you are , Mr. Olmstead . Beyond getting acquainted with the supercargo and the rest of your men , you will have no duties for a few days . You have full run of the ship , with one exception . Stay out of the control room until I call you . Is that clear ? " " Yes , sir . " Willoughby turned away and Samms , after tossing his space-bag into the rack , took inventory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the importance of mass , it was almost extravagantly supplied . There were shelves , or rather , tight racks , of books ; there were sun-lamps and card-shelves and exercisers and games ; there was a receiver capable of bringing in programs from almost anywhere in space . ' The room had only one lack ; it did not have an ultra-wave visiplate . Nor was this lack surprising . " They " would scarcely let George Olmstead know where " they " were taking him . Samms was surprised , however , when he met the men who were to be directly under his command ; for , instead of one , or at most two , they numbered exactly forty . And they were all , he thought at first glance , the dregs and sweepingsof the lowest dives in space . Before long , however , he learned that they were not all space-rats and denizens of Skid Rows . Six of them  --  the strongest physically and the hardest mentally of the lot  --  were fugitives from lethal chambers ; murderers and worse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock-drill-eyed , red-haired giant  --  and asked : " What did they tell you , Tworn , that your job was going to be ? " " They did n't say . Just that it was dangerous , but if I done exactly what my boss would tell me to do , and nothing else , I might not even get hurt . An ' I was due to take the deep breath the next week , see ? That 's just how it was , boss . " " I see , " and one by one Virgil Samms , master psychologist , studied and analyzed his motley crew until he was called into the control room . The navigating tank was covered ; no charts were to be seen . The one " live " visiplate showed a planet and a fiercely blue-white sun . " My orders are to tell you , at this point , all I know about what you 've got to do and about that planet down there . Trenco , they call it . " To Virgil Samms , the first adherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing whatever . " You are to take about five of your men , go down there , and gather all the green leaves you can . Not green in color ; sort of purplish . What they call broadleaf is the best ; leaves about two feet long and a foot wide . But do n't be too choosy . If there is n't any broadleaf handy , grab anything you can get hold of . " " What is the opposition ? " Samms asked , quietly . " And what have they got that makes them so tough ? " " Nothing . No inhabitants , even . Just the planet itself . Next to Arisia , it 's the God damndest planet in space . I 've never been any closer to it than this , and I never will , so I do n't know anything about it except what I hear ; but there 's something about it that kills men or drives them crazy . We spend seven or eight boats every trip , and thirty-five or forty men , and the biggest load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred pounds of leaf . A good many times we do n't get any . " " They go crazy , eh ? " In spite of his control , Samms paled . But it could n't be like Arisia . " What are the symptoms ? What do they say ? " " Various . Main thing seems to be that they lose their sight . Do n't go blind , exactly , but ca n't see where anything is ; or , if they do see it , it is n't there . And it rains over forty feet deep every night , and yet it all dries up by morning . The worst electrical storms in the universe , and windvelocities  --  Ican show you charts on that  --  of over eight hundred miles an hour . " " Whew ! How about time ? With your permission , I would like to do some surveying before I try to land . " " A smart idea . A couple of the other boys had the same , but it did n't help  --  they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRENCO 133Tellurian days  --  no , three  --  before I give you up and start sending out the other boats . Pick out your five men and see what you can do . " As the boat dropped away , Willoughby 's voice came briskly from a speaker . " I know that you five men have got ideas . Forget ' em . Fourth Officer Olmstead has the authority and the orders to put a half-ounce slug through the guts of any or all of you that do n't jump , and jump fast , to do what he tells you . And if that boat makes any funny moves I blast it out of the ether . Good harvesting ! " For forty-eight Tellurian hours , taking time out only to sleep , Samms scanned and surveyed the planet Trenco ; and the more he studied it , the more outrageously abnormal it became . Trenco was , and is , a peculiar planet indeed . Its atmosphereis not air as we know air ; its hydrosphere does not resemble water . Half of that atmosphere and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low heat of vaporization and having a boiling point of about seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . Trenco 's days are intensely hot ; its nights are bitterly cold . At night , therefore , it rains ; and by comparison a Telluriandownpour of one inch per hour is scarcely a drizzle . Upon Trenco it really rains  --  forty seven feet and five inches of precipitation , every night of every Trenconian year . And this tremendous condensation of course causes wind . Willoughby'sgraphs were accurate . Except at Trenco 's very poles there is not a spot in which or a time at which an Earthly gale would not constitute a dead calm ; and along the equator , at every sunrise and every sunset , the wind blows from the day side into the night side at a velocity which no Tellurian hurricane or cyclone , however violent , has even distantly approached . Also , therefore , there is lightning . Not in the mild and occasional flashes which we of gentle Terra know , but in a continuous , blinding glare which outshines a normal sun ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make darkness unknown there , but also distort beyondrecognition and beyond function the warp and the woof of space itself . Sight is almost completely useless in that fantasticallyaltered medium . So is the ultra-beam . Landing on the daylight side , except possibly at exact noon , would be impossible because of the wind , nor could the ship stay landed for more than a couple of minutes . Landing on the night side would be practically as bad , because of the terrific charge the boat would pick up  --  unless the boat carriedsomething that could be rebuilt into a leaker . Did it ? It did . Time after time , from pole to pole and from midnight around the clock , Samms stabbed visibeam and spy-ray down toward Trenco 's falsely-visible surface , with consistently and meaninglessly impossible results . The planet tipped , lurched , spun , and danced . It broke up into chunks , each of which began insanely to follow mathematically impossible paths . Finally , in desperation , he rammed a beam down and held it down . Again he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held on . He knew that he was well out of the stratosphere , a good two hundred miles up . Nevertheless , he saw a tremendous mass of jagged rock falling straight down , with terrific velocity , upon his tiny lifeboat ! Unfortunately the crew , to whom he had not been payingovermuch attention of late , saw it , too ; and one of them , with a bestial yell , leaped toward Samms and the controls . Samms , reaching for pistol and blackjack , whirled around just in time to see the big red-head lay the would-be attacker out cold with a vicious hand's-edge chop at the base of the skull . " Thanks , Tworn . Why ? " " Because I want to get out of this alive , and he 'd 've had us all in hell in fifteen minutes . You know a hell of a lot more than we do , so I 'm playin ' it your way . See ? " " I see . Can you use a sap ? " " An artist , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long you want a guy to be out and I wo n't miss it a minute , either way . But you 'd better blow that crumb 's brains out , right now . He ai n't no damn good . " 134 FIRST LENSMAN TRENCO 135 " Not until after I see whether he can work or not . You 're a Procian , are n't you ? " " Yeah . Midlands  --  North Central . " " What did you do ? " " Nothing much , at first . Just killed a guy that needed killing ; but the goddam louse had a lot of money , so they give me twenty five years . I did n't like it very well , and acted rough , so they give me solitary  --  boot , bandage , and so on . So I tried a break -- killed six or eight , maybe a dozen , guards  --  but did n't quite make it . So they slated me for the big whiff . That 's all , boss . " " I 'm promoting you , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He handed Tworn his blackjack . " Watch ' em  --  I 'll be too busy to . This landing is going to be tough . " " Gotcha , boss . " Tworn was calibrating his weapon by slugging himself experimentally on the leg . " Go ahead . As far as these crumbs are concerned , you 've got this air-tank all to.yourself . " Samms had finally decided what he was going to do . He located the terminator on the morning side , poised his little ship somewhat nearer to dawn than to midnight , and " cut the rope " . He took one quick reading on the sun , cut off his plates , and let her drop , watching only his pressure gages and gyros . One hundred millimeters of mercury . Three hundred . Five hundred . He slowed her down . He was going to hit a thin liquid , but if he hit it too hard he would smash the boat , and he had no idea what the atmospheric pressure at Trenco 's surface would be . Six hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than Earth 's . . . and it might be a lot less . Seven hundred . Slower and slower he crept downward , his tension mounting infinitely faster than did the needle of the gage . This was an instrument landing with a vengeance ! Eight hundred . How was the crew taking it ? How many of them had Tworn had to disable ? He glanced quickly around . None ! Now that they could not see the hallucinatory images upon the plates , they were not suffering at all  --  he himself was the only one aboard who was feeling the strain ! Nine hundred . . . nine hundred forty . The boat " hit the drink " with a crashing , splashing impact . Its pace was slow enough , however , and the liquid was deep enough , so that no damage was done . Samms applied a little driving power and swung his craft 's sharp nose into the line toward the sun . The little ship plowed slowly forward , as nearly just awash as Samms could keep her ; grounded as gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible downpour slackened ; the Lensman knew that the second critical moment was at hand . " Strap down , men , until we see what this wind is going to do to us . " The atmosphere , moving at a velocity well above that of sound , was in effect not a gas , but a solid . Even a spaceboat'shard skin of alloy plate , with all its bracing , could not take what was coming next . Inert , she would be split open , smashed , flattened out , and twisted into pretzels . Samms ' finger stabbed down ; the Berg went into action ; the lifeboat went free just as that raging blast of quasi-solid vapor wrenched her into the air . The second descent was much faster and much easier than the first . Nor , this time , did Samms remain surfaced or drive toward shore . Knowing now that this ocean was not deep enough to harm his vessel , he let her sink to the bottom . More , he turned her on her side and drove her at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of her starboard lock was flush with the ocean 's floor . Again they waited ; and this time the wind did not blow the lifeboat away . Upon purely theoretical grounds Samms had reasoned that the weird distortion of vision must be a function of distance , and his observations so far had been in accord with that hypothesis . Now , slowly and cautiously , he sent out a visibeam . Ten feet . . . twenty . . . forty . . . all clear . At fifty the seeing was definitely bad ; at sixty it became impossible . He shortened back to forty and began to study the vegetation , growing with such fantastic speed that the leaves , 136 FIRST LENSMAN TRENCO 137pressed flat to the ground by the gale and anchored there by heavy rootlets , were already inches long . There was also what seemed to be animal life , of sorts , but Samms was not , at the moment , interested in Trenconian zoology . " Are them the plants we 're going to get , boss ? " Tworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shall we go out now an ' start pickin ' ' em ? " " Not yet . Even if we could open the port the blast would wreck us . Also , it would shear your head off , flush with the coaming , as fast as you stuck it out . This wind should ease off after while ; we 'll go out a little before noon . In the meantime we 'll get ready . Have the boys break out a couple of spare Number Twelve struts , some clamps and chain , four snatch blocks , and a hundred feet of heavy spaceline .. . " Good , " he went on , when the order had been obeyed . " Rig the line from the winch through snatch blocks here , and here , and here , so I can haul you back against the wind . While you are doing that I 'll rig a remote control on the winch . " Shortly before Trenco 's fierce , blue-white sun reached meridian , the six men donned space-suits and Samms cautiouslyopened the air-lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an Earthly hurricane ; the wildly whipping broadleaf plants , struggling upward , were almost half-way to the vertical . The leaves were apparently almost fully grown . Four men clamped their suits to the line . The line was paid out . Each man selected two leaves ; the largest , fattest , purplest ones he could reach . Samms hauled them back and received the loot ; Tworn stowed the leaves away . Again-again  --  again . With noon there came a few minutes of " calm " . A strong man could stand against the now highly variable wind ; could move around without being blown beyond the horizon ; and during those few minutes all six men gathered leaves . That time , however , was very short . The wind steadied into the reverse direction with ever-increasing fury ; winch and space-line again came into play . And in a scant half hour , when the line began to hum an almost musical note under its load , Samms decided to call it quits . " That 'll be all for today , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line will part . You 've done too good a job to lose you . Secure ship . " " Shall I blow the air , sir ? " Tworn asked . " I do n't think so . " Samms thought for a moment . " No . I 'm afraid to take the chance . This stuff , whatever it is , is probably as poisonous as cyanide . We 'll keep our suits on and exhaust into space . " Time passed . " Night " came ; the rain and the flood . The bottom softened . Samms blasted the lifeboat out of the mud and away from the planet . He opened the bleeder valves , then both airlock ports ; the contaminated air was replaced by the ultra-hard vacuum of the interplanetary void . He signaled the Virgin Queen ; the lifeboat was taken aboard . " Quick trip , Olmstead , " Willoughby congratulated him . " I 'm surprised that you got back at all , to say nothing of with so much stuff and not losing a man . Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and forty eight pounds , sir , " the supercargoreported . " My God ! And all pure broadleaf ! Nobody ever did that before ! How did you do it , Olmstead ? " " I do n't know whether that would be any of your businessor not . " Samms ' mien was not insulting ; merely thoughtful . " Not that I give a damn , but my way might not help anybody else much , and I think I had better report to the main office first , and let them do the telling . Fair enough ? " " Fair enough , " the skipper conceded , ungrudgingly . " What a load ! And no losses ! " " One boatload of air , is all ; but air is expensive out here . " Samms made a point , deliberately . " Air ! " Willoughby snorted . " I 'll swap you a hundred flasks of air , any time , for any one of those leaves ! " Which was what Samms wanted to know. 138 FIRST LENSMAN TRENCO 139Captain Willoughby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to use and then to trample upon his inferiors ; to toady to such superiors as were too strong to be pulled down and thus supplanted . He knew that this Olmstead had what it took to be a big shot . Therefore : " They told me to keep you in the dark until we got to Trenco , " he more than half apologized to his Fourth Officer shortly after the Virgin Queen blasted away from the Trenconiansystem . " But they did n't say anything about afterwardsmaybe they figured you would n't be aboard any more , as usual  --  but anyway , you can stay right here in the control room if you want to . " " Thanks , Skipper , but might n't it be just as well , " he jerked his head inconspicuously toward the other officers , " to play the string out , this trip ? I do n't care where we 're going , and we do n't want anybody to get any funny ideas . " " That 'd be a lot better , of course  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as I 'm concerned . " " Thanks , Willoughby . I 'll remember that . " Samms had not been entirely frank with the pirate captain . From the time . required to make the trip , he knew to within a few parsecs Trenco 's distance from Sol . He did not know the direction , since the distance was so great that he had not been able to recognize any star or constellation . He did know , however , the course upon which the vessel then was , and he would know courses and distances from then on . He was well content . A couple of uneventful days passed . Samms was again called into the control room , to see that the ship was approaching a three-sun solar system . " This where we 're going to land ? " he asked , indifferently . " We ai n't going to land , " Willoughby told him . " You are going to take the broadleaf down in your boat , close enough so that you can parachute it down to where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go inert and match intrinsics . Now , Olmstead , watch . You 've seen systems like this before ? " " No , but I know about them . Those two suns overthere are a hell of a lot bigger and further away than they look , and this one here , much smaller , is in the Trojan position . Have those big suns got any planets ? " " Five or six apiece , they say ; all hotter and dryer than the brazen hinges of hell . This sun here has seven , but NumberTwo  --  ' Cavenda ' , they call it  --  is the only Tellurian planet in the system . The first thing we look for is a big , diamond-shaped continent . . . there 's only one of that shape ... there it is , over there . Notice that one end is bigger than the other  --  that end is north . Strike a line to split the continentin two and measure from the north end one-third of the length of the line . That 's the point we 're diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Virgin Queen , although still hundreds of miles up , was slowing rapidly . " It must be a big one . " " It 's a good fifty miles across . Go down until you 're dead sure that the box will land somewhere inside the rim of that crater . Then dump it . The parachute and the sender are automatic . Understand ? " " Yes , sir ; I understand , " and Samms took off . He was vastly more interested in the stars , however , than in delivering the broadleaf . The constellation directly beyondSol from wherever he was might be recognizable . Its shape would be smaller and more or less distorted ; its smaller stars , brilliant to Earthly eyes only because of their nearness , would be dimmer , perhaps invisible ; the picture would be further confused by intervening , nearby , brilliant strangers ; but such giants as Canopus and Rigel and Betelgeuse and Deneb would certainly be highly visible if he could only recognize them . From Trenco his search had failed ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweating with the mental effort , he blocked out the too-near , too-bright stars and studied intensively those that were left . A blue-white and a red were most prominent . Rigel and Betelgeuse ? Could that constellation be Orion ? The Belt was very faint , but it was there . Then Sirius ought to be about there , and Pollux about there ; and , at this distance , about equally140 FIRST LENSMAN TRENCO 141bright . They were . Aldebaran would be orange , and about one magnitude brighter than Pollux ; and Capella would be yellow , and half a magnitude brighter still . There they were ! Not too close to where they should be , but close enough  --  it was Orion ! And this thionite way-station , then , was somewhere near right ascension seventeen hours and declination plus ten degrees ! He returned to the Virgin Queen . She blasted off . Samms asked very few questions and Willoughby volun- teered very little information ; nevertheless the First Lens- man learned more than anyone of his fellow pirates would have believed possible . Aloof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend practically all of his time in his cabin when he was not actually at work ; but he kept his eyes and his ears wide open . And Virgil Samms , as has been intimated , had a brain . The Virgin Queen made a quick flit from Cavenda to Vegia , arriving exactly on time ; a proud , clean space-ship as high above suspicion as Calpurnia herself . Samms un- loaded her cargo ; replaced it with one for Earth . She was serviced . She made a fast , eventless run to Tellus . She docked at New York Spaceport . Virgil Samms walked un- concernedly into an ordinary-looking rest-room ; George Olmstead , fully informed , walked as unconcernedly out . As soon as he could , Samms Lensed Northrop and Jack Kinnison . " We lined up a thousand and one signals , sir , " Northrop reported for the pair , " but only one of them carried a mes- sage , and it did n't make sense . " " Why not ? " Samms asked , sharply . " With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coded , or interrupted , makes sense . " " Oh , we understood what it said , " Jack came in , " but it did n't say enough . Just READY  --  READY  --  READY ' ; over and over . " " What ! " Samms exclaimed , and the boys could feel his mind work . " Did that signal , by any chance , originate any- where near seventeen hours and plus ten degrees ? " " Very near . Why ? How did you know ? " " Then it does make sense ! " Samms exclaimed , and called a general conference of Lensmen . " Keep working along these same lines , " Samms directed , finally . " Keep Ray Olmstead in the Hill in my place . I am going to Pluto , and  --  I hope  --  to Palain Seven . " Roderick Kinnison of course protested ; but , equally of course , his protests were over-ruled . CHAPTER10Palainians on Pluto , , about forty times as far away from the sun as is Mother Earth . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much heat as does each of Pluto 's . The sun as seen from Pluto is a dim , wan speck . Even at perihelion , an event which occurs only once in two hundred forty eight Tellurian years , and at noon and on the equator , Pluto is so bitterly cold that climatic conditions upon its surface simply can not be described by or to warm-blooded , oxygen-breathing man . As good an indication as any can be given , perhaps , by mentioning the fact that it had taken the Patrol 's best engi- neers over six months to perfect the armor which Virgil Samms then wore . For no ordinary space-suit would do . Space itself is not cold ; the only loss of heat is by radiation into or through an almost perfect vacuum . In contact with Pluto 's rocky , metallic soil , however , there would be conduc- tion ; and the magnitude of the inevitable heat-loss made the Tellurian scientists gasp . " Watch your feet , Virge ! " had been Roderick Kinni- son 's insistent last thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that ground for five minutes they froze their feet to the ankles . Not that the boys aren'tPALAINIANS ON PLUTO 143good , but slipsticks sometimes slip in more ways than one . If your feet ever start to get cold , drop whatever you 're doing and drive back here at max ! " Virgil Samms landed . His feet stayed warm . Finally , assured that the heaters of his suit could carry the load indefinitely , he made his way on foot into the settlement near which he had come to ground . And there he saw his first Palainian . Or , strictly speaking , he saw part of his first Palainian ; for no three-dimensional creature has ever seen or ever will see in entirety any member of any of the frigid-blooded , poison-breathing races . Since life as we know it  --  organic , three-dimensional life  --  is based upon liquid water and gaseousoxygen , such life did not and could not develop upon planets . whose temperatures are only a few degrees above absolute zero . Many , perhaps most , of these ultra-frigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphereat all . Nevertheless , with or without atmosphere and completely without oxygen and water , life  --  highly intelligent life  --  did develop upon millions and millions of such worlds . That life is not , however , strictly three-dimensional . Of necessity , even in the lowest forms , it possesses an extension into the hyper-dimension ; and it is this metabolic extension alone which makes it possible for life to exist under such extreme conditions . This extension makes it impossible for any human being to see anything of a Palainian except the fluid , amorphous , ever-changing thing which is his three-dimensional aspect of the moment ; makes any attempt at description or portraiture completely futile . Virgil Samms stared at the Palainian ; tried to see what it looked like . He could not tell whether it had eyes or antennae ; legs , arms , or tentacles ; teeth or beaks ; talons or claws or feet ; skin , scales , or feathers . It did not even remotely resemble anything that the Lensman had ever seen , sensed , or imagined . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am Virgil Samms , a Tellurian , " he sent out slowly , 144 FIRST LENSMAN PALAINIANS ON PLUTO 145carefully , after he made contact with the outer fringes of the creature 's mind . " Is it possible for you , sir or madam , to give me a moment of your time ? " " Eminently possible , Lensman Samms , since my time is of completely negligible value . " The monster 's mind flashed into accord with Samms ' with a speed and precision that made him gasp . That is , a part of it became en rapport with a part of his : years were to pass before even the First Lensmanwould know much more about the Palainiaft than he learned in that first contact ; no human beings except the Children of the Lens ever were to understand even dimly the labyrinthine intricacies , the paradoxical complexities , of the Palainian mind . " Madam ' might be approximately correct , " the native 's thought went smoothly on . " My name , in your symbology , is Twelfth Pilinipsi ; by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexitroboper . I perceive that you are indeed a native of that hellish Planet Three , upon which it was assumed for so long that no life could possibly exist . But communication with your race has been almost impossible heretofore . . . Ah , the Lens . A remarkable device , truly . I would slay you and take it , except for the obvious fact that only you can possess it . " " What ! " Dismay and consternation flooded Samms ' mind . " You already know the Lens ? " " No . Yours is the first that any of us has perceived . The mechanics , the mathematics , and the basic philosophy of the thing , however , are quite clear . " " What ! " Samms exclaimed again . " You can , then , produceLenses yourselves ? " " By no means , any more than you Tellurians can . There are magnitudes , variables , determinants , and forces involved which no Palainian will ever be able to develop , to generate , on to control . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For aFirst Lensman , he was making a wretched showing indeed .. . " Far from it , sir , " the monstrosity assured him . " Consideringthe strangeness of the environment into which youhave voluntarily flung yourself so senselessly , your mind is well integrated and strong . Otherwise it would have shattered . If our positions were reversed , the mere thought of the raging heat of your Earth would  --  come no closer , please ! " The thing vanished ; reappeared many yards away . Her thoughts were a shudder of loathing , of terror , of sheer detestation . " But to get on . I have been attempting to analyze and to understand your purpose , without success . That failure is not too surprising , of course , since my mind is weak and my total power is small . Explain your mission , please , as simply as you can . " Weak ? Small ? In view of the power the monstrosity had just shown , Samms probed for irony , for sarcasm or pretense . There was no trace of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen solid minutes , to explain the Galactic Patrol , but at the end the Palainian 's only reaction was one of blank non-comprehension . " I fail completely to perceive the use of , or the need for , such an organization , " she stated flatly . " This altruism  --  what good is it ? It is unthinkable that any other race would take any risks or exert any effort for us , any more than we would for them . Ignore and be ignored , as you must already know , is the Prime Tenet . " " But there is a little commerce between our worlds ; your people did not ignore our psychologists ; and you are not ignoring me , " Samms pointed out . " Oh , none of us is perfect , " Pilinipsi replied , with a mental shrug and what seemed to be an airy wave of a multitentacledmember . " That ideal , like any other , can only be approached asymptotically , never reached ; and I , being somewhatfoolish and silly , as well as weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flabbergasted , Samms tried a new tack . " I might be able to make my position clearer if I knew you better . I know your name , and that you are a woman of Palain Seven "  --  it is a measure of Virgil Samms ' real size that he actually thought " woman " , and not merely " female "  --  " but all I can146 FIRST LENSMAN PALAINIANS ON PLUTO 147understand of your occupation is the name you have given it . What does a Chief Dexitroboper do ? " " She  --  or he  --  or , perhaps , it . . . is a supervisor of the work of dexitroboping . " The thought , while perfectly clear , was completely meaningless to Samms , and the Palainian knew it . She tried again . " Dexitroboping has to do with .. . nourishment ? No  --  with nutrients . " " Ah . Farming  --  agriculture , " Samms thought ; but this time it was the Palainian who could not grasp the concept . " Hunting ? Fishing ? " No better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried ; but demonstration , too , was useless ; for to Samms the Palainian 's movements were pointless indeed . The peculiarly flowing , subtly changing thing darted back and forth , rose and fell , appeared and disappeared ; undergoingthe while cyclic changes in shape and form and size , in aspect and texture . It was now spiny , now tentacular , now scaly , now covered with peculiarly repellent feather-like fronds , each oozing a crimson slime . But it apparently did not do anything whatever . The net result of all its activity was , apparently , zero . " There , it is done . " Pilinipsi 's thought again came clear . " You observed and understood ? You did not . That is strange  --  baffling . Since the Lens did improve communicationand understanding tremendously , I hoped that it might extend to the physical as well . But there must be some basic , fundamental difference , the nature of which is at present obscure . I wonder . . . if I had a Lens , too  --  but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eagerly . " Why do n't you go to Arisia and be tested for one ? You have a magnificient , a really tremendous mind . It is of Lensman grade in every respect except one  --  you simply do n't want to use it ! " " Me ? Go to Arisia ? " The thought would have been , in a Tellurian , a laugh of scorn . " How utterly silly  --  how abysmally stupid ! There would be personal discomfort , quite possibly personal danger , and two Lenses would be little or no better than one in resolving differences between our two continua , which are probably in fact incommensurable . " " Well , then , " Samms thought , almost viciously , " canyou introduce me to someone who is stupider , sillier , and more foolish than you are ? " " Not here on Pluto , no . " The Palainian took no offense . " That was why it was I who interviewed the earlier Tellurianvisitors and why I am now conversing with you . The others avoided you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim . " How about the home planet , then ? " " Ah . Undoubtedly . In fact , there is a group , a club , of such persons . None of them is , of course , as insane  --  as aberrant  --  as you are , but they are all much more so than I am . " " Who of this club would be most interested in becoming a Lensman ? " " Tallick was the least stable member of the NewThoughtClub when I left Seven ; Kragzex a close second . There may of course have been changes since then . But I can not believe that even Tallick  --  even Tallick at his outrageousworst  --  would be crazy enough to join your Patrol . " " Nevertheless , I must see him myself . Can you and will you give me a chart or a routing from here to Palain Seven ? " " I can and I will . Nothing you have thought will be of any use to me ; that will be the easiest and quickest way of getting rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samms mind , snapped the telepathic line , and went unconcernedly about her incomprehensible business . Samms , mind reeling , made his way back to his boat and took off . And as the light-years and the parsecs screamed past , he sank deeper and deeper into a welter of unproductive speculation . What were  --  really  --  those Palainians ? How could they -- really  --  exist as they seemed to exist ? And why had some of that dexitroboper 's  --  whatever that meant !  --  thoughts come in so beautifully sharp and clear and plain , while others ... ? He knew that his Lens would receive and would convertinto his own symbology any thought or message , howevercoded or garbled or however sent or transmitted . The148 FIRST LENSMAN PALAINIANS ON PLUTO 149Lens was not at fault ; his symbology was . There were concepts  --  things  --  actualities  --  occurrences  --  soforeign to Tellurianexperience that no referents existed . Hence the humanmind lacked the channels , the mechanisms , to grasp them . He and Roderick Kinnison had glibly discussed the possibility of encountering forms of intelligent life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with them . After what Samms had just gone through , that was more of a possibility than either he or his friend had believed ; and he hoped grimly , as he considered how seriously this partial contact with the Palainian had upset him , that the possibility would never become a fact . He found the Palainian system easily enough , and Palain Seven . That planet , of course , was almost as dark upon its sunward side as upon the other , and its inhabitants had no use for light . Pilinipsi 's instructions , however , had been minute and exact ; hence Samms had very little trouble in locating the principal city  --  or , rather , the principal village , since there were no real cities . He found the planet 's one spaceport . What a thing to call a port ! He checked back ; recalled exactly this part of his interview with Pluto 's Chief Dexitroboper . " The place upon which space-ships land , " had been her thought , when she showed him exactly where it was in relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been his mind , not hers , that had supplied the docks and cradles , the service cars , the officers , and all the other things taken for granted in space-fields everywhere as Samms knew them . Either the Palainian had not perceived the trappings with which Samms had invested her visualization , or she had not cared enough about his misapprehension to go to the trouble of correcting it ; he did not know which . The whole area was as bare as his hand . Except for the pitted , scarred , slagged-down spots which showed so clearly what driving blasts would do to such inconceivably cold rock and metal , Palainport was in no way distinguishable fromany other unimproved portion of the planet 's utterly bleak surface . There were no signals ; he had been told of no landing conventions . Apparently it was everyone for himself . WhereforeSamms ' tremendous landing lights blazed out , and with their aid he came safely to ground . He put on his armor and strode to the airlock ; then changed his mind and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in view of the rugged and deserted field and the completely unknown terrain between the field and the town , he decided to ride the " creep " instead . This vehicle , while slow , could go  --  literally  --  anywhere . It had a cigar-shaped body of magnalloy ; it had big , soft , tough tires ; it had cleated tracks ; it had air- and waterpropellers ; it had folding wings ; it had driving , braking , and steering jets . It could traverse the deserts of Mars , the oceans and swamps of Venus , the crevassed glaciers of Earth , the jagged , frigid surface of an iron asteroid , and the cratered , fluffy topography of the moon ; if not with equal speed , at least with equal safety . Samms released the thing and drove it into the cargo lock , noting mentally that he would have to exhaust the air of that lock into space before he again broke the inner seal . The ramp slid back into the ship ; the cargo port closed . Here he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not know the Palainians ' reaction to or attitude toward light . It had not occurred to him while at Pluto to ask , and it might be important . The landing lights of his vessel might already have done his cause irreparable harm . He could drive by starlight if he had to . . . but he needed light and he had not seen a single living or moving thing . There was no evidencethat there was a Palainian within miles . While he had known , with his brain , that Palain would be dark , he had expected to find buildings and traffic  --  ground-cars , planes , and at least a few space-ships  --  and not this vast nothingness . If nothing else , there must be a road from Palain 's principal city to its only spaceport ; but Samms had not seen150 FIRST LENSMANit from his vessel and he could not see it now . At least , he could not recognize it . Wherefore he clutched in the tractor drive and took off in a straight line toward town . The going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the creep was built to stand up under punishment and its pilot 's chair was sprung and cushioned to exactly the same degree . Hence , while the course itself was infinitely worse than the smoothly paved approaches to Rigelston , Samms found this trip much less bruising than the other had been . Approaching the village , he dimmed his roadlights and slowed down . At its edge he cut them entirely and inched his way forward by starlight alone . What a town ! Virgil Samms had seen the inhabited places of almost every planet of Civilization . He had seen cities laid out in circles , sectors , ellipses , triangles , squares , parallelopipeds  --  practically every plan known to geometry . He had seen structures of all shapes and sizes  --  narrow skyscrapers , vast-spreading one-stories , polyhedra , domes , spheres , semi-cylinders , and erect and inverted full and truncated cones and pyramids . Whatever the plan or the shapes of the component units , however , those inhabited places had , without exception , been understandable . But this ! Samms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the more he saw the less he grasped . There was no plan , no coherence or unity whatever . It was as though a cosmic hand had flung a few hundreds of buildings , of incredibly and senselessly varied shapes and sizes and architectures , upon an otherwise empty plain , and as though each structure had been allowed ever since to remain in whatever location and attitude it had chanced to fall . Here and there were jumbled piles of three or more utterly incongruousstructures . There were a few whose arrangement was almost orderly . Here and there were large , irregularlyshapedareas of bare , untouched ground . There were no streets  --  at least , nothing that the man could recognize as such . Samms headed the creep for one of those open areas , PALAINIANS ON PLUTO 151then stopped  --  declutched the tracks , set the brakes , andkilled the engines . " Go slow , fellow , " he advised himself then . " Until youfind out what a dexitroboper actually does while working at his trade , do n't take chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  that frigid-blooded poisonbreatherswere not strictly three-dimensional ; but Samms did know that he had actually seen things which he could not understand . He and Kinnison had discussed such occurrencescalmly enough ; but the actuality was enough to shakeeven the mind of Civilization 's First Lensman . He did not need to be any closer , anyway . He hadlearned the Palainians ' patterns well enough to Lens them from a vastly greater distance than his present one ; this personal visit to Palainopolis had been a gesture of friendliness , not a necessity . " Tallick ? Kragzex ? " He sent out the questing , queryingthought . " Lensman Virgil Samms of Sol Three callingTallick and Kragzex of Palain Seven . " " Kragzex acknowledging , Virgil Samms , " a thoughtsnapped back , as diamond-clear , as precise , as Pilinipsi 's hadbeen . " Is Tallick here , or anywhere on the planet ? " " He is here , but he is emmfozing at the moment . Hewill join us presently . " " Damnation ! There it was again ! First " dexitroboping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , " Samms requested . " I fail tograsp the meaning of your thought . " " So I perceive . The fault is of course mine , in notbeing able to attune my mind fully to yours . Do not take this , please , as any aspersion upon the character or strengthof your own mind . " " Of course not . I am the first Tellurian you have met ? " " Yes . " " I have exchanged thoughts with one other Palainian , and the same difficulty existed . I can neither understand nor152 FIRST LENSMAN PALAINIANS ON PLUTO 153explain it ; but it is as though there are differences between us so fundamental that in some matters mutual comprehensionis in fact impossible . " " A masterly summation and undoubtedly a true one . This emmfozing , then  --  if I read correctly , your race has only two sexes ? " " You read correctly . " " I can not understand . There is no close analogy . However , emmfozing has to do with reproduction . " " I see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his experience , but also a new view of both the powers and the limitations of his Lens . It was , by its very nature , of precisionist grade . It receivedthoughts and translated them precisely into English . There was some leeway , but not much . If any thought was such that there was no extremely close counterpart or referentin English , the Lens would not translate it at all , but would simply give it a hitherto meaningless symbol  --  a symbolwhich would from that time on be associated , by all Lenses everywhere , with that one concept and no other . Samms realized then that he might , some day , learn what a dexitroboper actually did and what the act of emmfozing actually was ; but that he very probably would not . Tallick joined them then , and Samms again described glowingly , as he had done so many times before , the Galactic Patrol of his imaginings and plannings . Kragzex refused to have anything to do with such a thing , almost as abruptly as Pilinipsi had done , but Tallick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am not entirely sane , " he admitted , " which may explain the fact that I would very much like to have a Lens . But I gather , from what you have said , that I would probably not be given a Lens to use purely for my own selfish purposes ? " " That is my understanding , " Samms agreed . " I was afraid so . " Tallick 's mien was . . . " woebegone " is the only word for it . " I have work to do . Projects , you know , of difficulty , of extreme complexity and scope , sometimeseven approaching danger . A Lens would be of tre-mendous use . " " Flow ? " Samms asked . " If your work is of enough importance to enough people , Mentor would certainly give you a Lens . " " This would benefit me ; only me . We of Palain , as you probably already know , are selfish , mean-spirited , smallsouled , cowardly , furtive , and sly . Of what you call bravery ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealth , by indirection , by trickery and deceit . " Ruthlessly the Lens was giving Virgil Samms the uncompromisingly , exact English equivalent of the Palainian 's every thought . " We operate , when we must operate at all openly , with the absolutely irreducibleminimum of personal risk . These attitudes and attributeswill , I have no doubt , preclude all possibility of Lensmanship for me and for every member of my race . " " Not necessarily . " Not necessarily ! Although Virgil Samms did not know it , this was one of the really critical moments in the coming into being of the Galactic Patrol . By a conscious , a tremendouseffort , the First Lensman was lifting himself above the narrow , intolerant prejudices of human experience and was consciously attempting to see the whole through Mentor 's Arisian mind instead of through his Tellurian own . That Virgil Samms was the first human being to be born with the ability to accomplish that feat even partially was one of the reasons why he was the first wearer of the Lens . " Not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was inexpressibly shocked  --  revolted in every human fiber  --  by what this unhuman monster had so frankly and callously thought . There were , however , many things which no human being ever could understand , and there was not the shadow of a doubt that this Tallick had a really tremendousmind . " You have said that your mind is feeble . If so , there is no simple expression of the weakness of mine . I can perceive only one , the strictly human , facet of the truth . In a broader view it is distinctly possible that your motivation is at least as noble ' as mine . And to complete154 FIRST LENSMANmy argument , you work with other Palainians , do you not , to reach a common goal ? " " At times , yes . " " Then you can conceive of the desirability of working with non-Palainian entities toward an end which would benefitboth races ? " " Postulating such an end , yes ; but I am unable to visualize any such . Have you any specific project in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducked . He had already fired every shot in his locker .. " I am quite certain , however , that if you go to Arisia you will be informed of several such projects . " There was a period of silence . Then : " I believe that I will go to Arisia , at that ! " Tallick exclaimed , brightly . " I will make a deal with your friend Mentor . I will give him a share  --  say fifty percent , or forty  --  of the time and effort I save on my own projects ! " " Just so you go , Tallick . " Samms concealed right manfullyhis real opinion of the Palainian 's scheme . " When can you go ? Right now ? " " By no means . I must first finish this project . A year , perhaps  --  or more ; or possibly less . Who knows ? " Tallick cut communications and Samms frowned . He did not know the exact length of Seven 's year , but he knew that it was long  --  very long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot John K. Kinnison and Master Electronicist Mason M. Northrop , was blasting along a course very close indeed to RA17 : D+1o . In equipment and personnel , however , she was not an ordinary scout . Her control room was so full of electronics racks and computing machines that there was scarcely footway in any direction ; her graduated circles and vernier scales were of a size and a fineness usually seen only in the great vessels of the GalacticSurvey . And her crew , instead of the usual twenty-odd men , numbered only seven  --  one cook , three engineers , and three watch officehs . For come time the young Third Officer , then at the board , had been studying something on his plate ; comparing it minutely with the chart clipped into the rack in front of him . Now he turned , with a highly exaggerated deference , to the two Lensmen . " Sirs , which of your Magnificences is officially the commanderof this here bucket of odds and ends at the present instant ? " " Him . " Jack used his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplaced plucked eyebrow on his upper lip . I do n't come on duty until sixteen hundred hours  --  one precious Tellurianminute yet in which to dream of the beauties of156 FIRST LENSMAN ZABRISKAN FONTEMA 157Earth , so distant in space and in both past and future time . " " Huh ? Beauties ? Plural ? Next time I see a party whose pictures are cluttering up this whole ship I 'll tell her about your polygamous ideas . I 'll ignore that crack about my mustache , though , since you ca n't raise one of your own . I 'm ignoring you , too  --  like this , see ? " Ostentatiously turning his back upon the lounging Kinnison , Northrop stepped carefully over three or four breadboard hookups and stared into the plate over the watch officer 's shoulder . He then studied the chart . " Was ist los , Stu ? I do n't see a thing . " " More Jack 's line than yours , Mase . This system we 're headed for is a triple , and the chart says it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unexplored , so the charts are astronomicals , not surveys . But that makes us Prime Discoverers , and our Commanding Officer  --  and the book says Officer ' , not Officers '  --  has got to ... " " That 's me , now , " Jack announced , striding grandly toward the plate . " Amscray , oobsbay . I will name the baby . I will report . I will go down in history ... " " Bounce back , small fry . You were n't at the time of discovery . " Northrop placed a huge hand flat against Jack 's face and pushed gently . " You 'll go down , sure enough  --  not in history , but from a knock on the knob  --  if you try to steal any thunder away from me . And besides , you 'd name it Dimples '  --  what a revolting thought ! " " And what would you name it ? TVirgilia ' , I suppose ? " " Far from it , my boy . " He had intended doing just that , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . The planet we 're heading for will be Zabriska ; the suns will be A- , B- , and C-Zabriskae , in order of size ; and the watch officer then on duty , Lieutenant L. Stuart Rawlings , will engrossthese and all other pertinent data in the log . Can you classify ' em from here , Jack ? " " I can make some guesses  --  close enough , probably , for Discovery work . " Then , after a few minutes : " Two giants , a blue-white and a bluish yellow ; and a yellow dwarf . " " Dwarf in the Trojan ? " " That would be my guess , since that is the only placeit could stay very long , but you ca n't tell much from one look . I can tell you one thing , though -- unless your Zabriska is in a system straight beyond this one , it 's got to be a planet of the big fellow himself ; and brother , that sun is hot ! " " It 's got to be here , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading a beam since I was a sophomore . " " I 'll buy that . . . well , we 're close enough , I guess . " Jack killed the driving blasts , but not the Bergenholm ; the inertialess vessel stopped instantaneously in open space . " Now we 've got to find out which one of those twelve or fifteen planets was on our line when that last message was sent . . . There , we 're stable enough , I hope . Open your cameras , Mase . Pull the first plate in fifteen minutes . That ought to give me enough track so I can start the job , since we 're at a wide angle to their ecliptic . " The work went on for an hour or so . Then : " Something coming from the direction of Tellus , " thewatch officer reported . " Big and fast . Shall I hail her ? " " Might as well , " but the stranger hailed first . " Space-ship Chicago , NA2AA , calling . Are you introuble ? Identify yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ... " " Northrop ! Jack ! " came Virgil Samms ' highly concernedthought . The superdreadnaught flashed alongside , a bare few hundred miles away , and stopped . " Why did you stop here ? " " This is where our signal came from , sir . " " Oh . " A hundred thoughts raced through Samms ' mind , too fast and too fragmentary to be intelligible . " I see you 're computing . Would it throw you off too much to go inert and match intrinsics , so that I can join you ? " " No sir ; I 've got everything I need for a while . " Samms came aboard ; three Lensmen studied the chart . " Cavenda is there , " Samms pointed out . " Trenco is there , off to one side . I felt sure that your signal originated on Cavenda ; but Zabriska , here , while on almost the same line , is less than half as far from Tellus . " He did not ask158 FIRST LENSMAN ZABRISKAN FONTEMA 159whether the two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This arouses my curiosity no end  --  does it merely complicate the thionite problem , or does it set up an entirely new problem ? Go ahead , boys , with whatever you were going to do next . " Jack had already determined that the planet they wanted was the second out ; A-Zabriskae Two . He drove the scout as close to the planet as he could without losing complete coverage ; stationed it on the line toward Sol . " Now we wait a bit , " he answered . " According to recent periodicity , not less than four hours and not more than ten . With the next signal we 'll nail that transmitter down to within a few feet . Got your spotting screens full out , Mase ? " " Recent periodicity ? " Samms snapped . " It has improved , then , lately ? " " Very much , sir . " " That helps immensely . With George Olmstead harvestingbroadleaf , it would . It is still one problem . While we wait , shall we study the planet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a disappointingplanet indeed . It was small , waterless , airless , utterly featureless , utterly barren . There were no elevations , no depressions , no visible markings whatever  --  not even a meteor crater . Every square yard of its surface was apparentlyexactly like every other . " No rotation , " Jack reported , looking up from the bolometer . " That sand-pile is not inhabited and never will be . I 'm beginning to wonder . " " So am I , now , ' . ' Northrop admitted . " I still say that those signals came from this line and distance , but it looks as though they must have been sent from a ship . If so , now that we 're here  --  particularly the Chicago  --  there will be no more signals . " " Not necessarily . " Again Samms ' mind transcended his Tellurian experience and knowledge . He did not suspect the truth , but he was not jumping at conclusions . " There may be highly intelligent life , even upon such a planet as this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications beam snapped into life . " READY  --  READY  --  READY . . . " it said briskly , for not quite one minute , but that was time enough . Northrop yelped a string of numbers ; Jack blasted the little vessel forward and downward ; the three watch officers , keen-eyed at their plates , stabbed their visibeams , ultrabeams , and spy-rays along the indicated line . " And bore straight through the planet if you have to  --  they may be on the other side ! " Jack cautioned , sharply . " They are n't  --  it 's here , on this side ! " Rawlings saw it first . " Nothing much to it , though . . . it looks like a relay station . " " A relay ! I 'll be a . . . " Jack started to express an unexpurgated opinion , but shut himself up . Young cubs did not swear in front of the First Lensman . " Let 's land , sir , and look the place over , anyway . " " By all means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon , while actually quite a little closer than that of Earth , seemed much more distant because there was nothing whatever  --  no tree , no shrub , no rock or pebble , not even the slightest ripple  --  to break the geometrical perfection of that surface of smooth , hard , blindingly reflective , fiendishly hot white sand . Samms was highly dubious at first  --  a ground-tempertaure of four hundred seventy five degrees was not to be taken lightly ; he did not at all like the looks of that ultra-fervent blue-white sun ; and in his wildest imaginings he had never pictured such a desert . Their space-suits , however , were very well insulated , particularly as to the feet , and highly polished ; and in lieu of atmosphere there was an almost perfect vacuum . They could stand it for a while . The box which housed the relay station was made of non-ferrous metal and was roughly cubical in shape , perhaps five feet on a side . It was so buried that its upper edge was flush with the surface ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not bolted or welded , but was simply laid on , loose.
