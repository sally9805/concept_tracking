none . I figgered we would get along all right once they seen that fellow warnt much of a guard at all , so I did nt push it none . I set there and smoked and watched them come up , some of them in cars that their folks drove , waving good-bye and all like that , and then standing around joking with each other and all . And there was one of them I watched a good bit because he seemed kind of different from the others and stuck out , so to speak . I mean he kind of stood away from the others and was real quiet and had these dark glasses on and held his back real straight , and he did nt go around punching at everybody like the others did . He would just look at them real serious when they came over to speak to him , and then he would kind of nod his head a little bit , like he was thinking of something else ; and then he might mumble somethingand they would all stop and listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he usually wouldnt  --  he would turn his head away again and take a big drag on his cigarette and blow it out real smooth and steady , kind of twisting his head around to look at something across the street . So I watched him and heered them calling him " Irvin " and tried to figger him out . I did nt have no luck at it , though , until I heered this one fellow say to somebody else , " That fellow 's had ROTC , " or something like that . Anyhow , I did nt know what it was because I never had heered of it before , but then I heered this other fellow mention the same thing and see how impressed they was by it , so I finally figgered that he must still have a touch of it in him . I mean I got to thinking that at one time or another , he must have almost died from it . So they seemed like a real nice bunch the way they made on over him and everything , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did nt ask anything 40from nobody but stood there just as straight as he could like he could take care of himself no matter what . Anyhow , in a little bit , McKinney come walking up , and was grinning and taking on real merry with everybody himself , and acting real nice about everything . He said , " Well , you boys go up there and show them the kind of men we raise down here , " and they all joked back at him ; and then he said a lot of funny things like , " Do nt take any wooden nickels , " and " Do nt do nothing that I wouldnt do , " and " Be good , and if you cant be good , be careful , " and a lot of things like that . Course he did nt speak to me or nothing , but he did seem a lot nicer once you seen him being friendlythat way . And then he done something else I thought was real nice of him too . He went over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you to keep these boys in line now . I 'm leaving you in charge of them for the rest of the way , youhear ? " And Irvin nodded his head , just as casual as he always was , and said , " Okay , McKinney , " like it did nt mean a thing to him . He kind of took a deep drag on his cigarette and then held it between his fingers and flipped it out in the street , like if they wanted to make him head man , that was up to them , and he had nt asked for it all . So I thought it was a pretty decent thing for McKinney todo , but about that time McKinney kind of tapped him onthe shoulder and said , " Come over here a minute . I got a fewthings I think I better tell you before I leave here , " kind ofcocking his eye at me when he said it . And then he got Irvinover to the side and got right up in his face and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . And thenIrvin would kind of glance back over his shoulder at me and41then nod his head again , and then McKinney would get to going again . And in a few minutes there was three or four of them ganged around listening with their heads popping around at me and then back at McKinney again ; so I seen then he warnt putting no half-dead man in charge just to be decent . He was just using him . Once I figgered I warnt going to stand for it no more , but time I made a move to get up , I heered the guard suck in his breath real deep and I looked around at him and he was right white in the face , so I set down again . So I did nt do nothing , and then McKinney got out in front of them and made a little speech , saying as how Irvin was in charge and for everybody to do just what he said and all like that , and then he said " Good luck " to everybody and raised up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then everybody got to joking around again , and then Irvin got out in front and made a speech too about how he expected everybody to behave and how he was going to assign seats to everybody and all like that . So then they joked some more and took on a good bit , and there was this one fellow called Lucky that kept everybody laughing all the time . When Irvin said he was going to assign seats to everybody , this fellowsaid , " Well , I got a seat all right but I just got to find a place to put it , " and everybody laughed a good bit about that one . He told it a few more times , and then he told the fellow next to him , " I want a seat for my seat , " and said a lot of crazy things like that that just kept everybody laughing all the time . So I kind of got to enjoying it and nearly forgot about McKinney , and when I seen Irvin heading over toward me , I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood up too , even though it did make the guard jump . But42then Irvin walked right up to me and said pretty rough , " Stockdale , I do nt want any trouble out of you , you understand that ? I do nt want one peep out of you . You get on that bus and sit down do nt open your mouth until we get out . You might as well start learning something right now  --  when you 're in the Army , you do as you 're told . " " Sho , I will , Irvin . Whatever you say . " " My name to you is Blanchard , " he said . " Oh , " I said . " Well , whatever you say . . . I 'll do whatever you say . " It did kind of get away with me , though , because I had been smiling so pleasant when he lit into me that way . And then he kind of cocked his head to one side and looked at me kind of funny and said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " No , I ai nt . . . I just want to tell you about McKinney . He " Well , do nt , " he said , and then started to turn away and walk off , but then he stopped and said , " And I thought you was so tough . . . " but then he caught himself and said , " Not one peep , you understand ? " And I said , " Whatever you say . . . " and set back down because by that time he had walked on off and I did nt have a chance to explain nothing to him . So then I set back down and everybody went over and crowded around Irvin asking him all sorts of questions and things . And after that they kind of started making remarks at me . They kind of held back at first until Irvin stepped up and said kind of short , " Hey , boy , you ai nt planning to go AWOL , are you ? " So I looked up and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwith , " You wouldnt know if you went , would you ? " Then43everybody kind of laughed , and then come ganging around , and all of them got started on me . I mean they would ask me things like had I ever been in town before , and had I ever rode in a bus before , and things like that . And then Lucky asked if I had rocks in the bottom of my shoes to make me think I was barefooted , and everybody laughed and heehawedabout that one , and I did too because I thought it was right good ; but then they got rougher and rougher , so I got where finally I wouldnt say nothing at all . I mean Irvin was standing there and he was in charge and all , and I warnt going to cause him no trouble if I could help it . So finally I just wouldnt say nothing and set there smoking like I did nt even hear them . So they let me alone for a while , but when the bus come up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get moving there , boy , " and that kind of set them all off again . But anyhow , I kind of enjoyed the trip up there . I got me a seat in the back of the bus and after a while they sort of forgot about me and I got a kick out of it . I had been to Pinehurstbut that was as far north as I had ever been , but that day we went right on through Pinehurst and come to another town just as big , and then another one that was as big as Callvilleand Pinehurst put together , I bet . And in a couple of hours we went through Macon and I bet it took us half an hour to even get through the place . Then after Macon there were some more towns and looked like we never would quit going through them all . Anyhow , I really enjoyed it that way but somewhere between Macon and Atlanta , I dozed off and did nt wake up again until we was finally at Fort Thompson . Anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember I was dreaming about fishing down on the creek and all of a sudden this moccasin come skimming across the44 45water and bit me right on the leg . It really made me hop because the pain was running all through it and when I come to and seen Irvin and all the others standing there over me , it was just like he was the snake and had changed into a man all of a sudden . So I started at him before I knowed what I was doing . I reached out and snatched him by the neck so he almost come over the seat , and then I swung him around and was just ready to bust him one before I come to and knowed what I was doing . And of course it was too late by that time , and I felt like a dog mighty quick , too . I had nt hit him , but I had scared him a good bit there for a minuteand I felt pretty low about it . And he got pretty mad about it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did nt blame him at all . He cussed me right through his teeth with his eyes squenched up and when he got through cussing me every way he could think of , he drawed back and give me another good kick in the shins . I had it coming too . I reached down and rubbed it and said , " I 'm sorry , Irvin . I guess I did nt know what I was doing or something , " and humbled myself a good bit that way . And after that , I set out under a tree waiting for us to go wherever we was going and did nt nobody say nothing to me for a good while . They was all kidding around and making on over Irvin for the way he tied into me , and I was kind of glad to see it too . I felt so low treating him the way I had that I was glad to see any good he could get out of it . All I could do was cuss myself and wonder if I could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off , and get along in the draft , and not have no trouble , and just get along with everybody from then on. 6Anyhow , they finally took us down to this place that had a lot of bunks in it , and I went down to the end to get away from the rest of them and set down on the bottom bunk and rolled me a cigarette and was just getting ready to light it when this scrawny little fellow with big glasses on walked right up to where I was setting and stood there looking at me . He did n't say nothing , just stood there , and when I looked up to see who it was , I seen it warnt none of the bunch that had come up with me . He was real little and he had on this uniformthat was so new it still had the sideways creases in it , and he had on one of them little half-hats that are supposed to set on the side of your head , only his set all the way down on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants he had on was mighty near long enough for me  --  he had them rolled up about a foot off the floor  --  and he had on this coat with brass buttons that looked too big for him to even be toting . And besides that , he had this bag over his shoulder that you could have put four of him in , and he stood there looking at me with the sweat rolling down the side of his face , looking right miserable , so I knowed right off I had nt seen him before ; and the first thing I wanted to do was to jump up and help him with it all . But he kept standing there looking at me , and then he tried to grin , only he couldnt manage it so good because the46bag pulled him so hard on one side that it seemed to pull his mouth sideways too , but anyhow he tried , so I set up a little bit and said , " Howdy . " He still kept looking at me , and then said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , I hope . " And he said , " Yeah , I 'm okay , " and kept standing there looking at me until I said , " Right hot , ai nt it ? " because he looked like he had fell in a creek or something with all those wool clothes on the way he was sweating ; but then he said , " Was you going to take that bottom bunk ? " " Was this yourn ? " And he said , " Well , not exactly . But usually in the Army , it 's first come , first served , and I was here . . . " Sho , " I said . " Sho . You go right ahead and take it . I did nt know you . . . " " I should have left something on it to show it , " he said . " That 's what I should have done . But I did nt do it . It servesme right , I guess . I should have knowed better . " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just setting here . " But he shook his head and said , " No , you go ahead andtake it . I should have left something . It was my mistake . " " I 'd just as soon . . . But he kept shaking his head . " No , it was all my mistake and I should have left something and I do nt deserve it for not knowing better . " So he had me kind of bothered about it then and I tried to argue him into taking the bottom one anyhow , but he kept shaking his head and wouldnt hear nothing of it . Sc then I told a big lie about how I couldnt stand sleeping next to the floor nohow and how at home I always heisted my bed up about five feet off the floor with brickbats under it and had to use a chair to crawl up in it , but he just kept shak-47ing his head , saying , " No , anybody in the Army ought to have sense enough to leave something to show what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to talk about it no more . And then he started trying to chunk his bag up on the top bunk but he couldnt get it up much higher than his shoulder , grunting and puffing with his face turning red . I wanted to help him , but being little and scrawny the way he was , I knowed he would want to do it all by himself so I just stood back and let him heave at it a while until I seen he warnt likely to make it , and then I said , " Looka here now , I 'd ruther have that top one , and I mean it . " But he shook his head and heaved again and said , " I 'm gon na take it . " " No , you ai nt , " I said . " I said I wanted it and I do , and I ai nt gon na take no for an answer . " But he kept on trying to hoist his bag up there , so I give that up and finally edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him a lift without him knowing it ; but about that time Irvin come bounding across the room saying , " Get your hand off that bag , Stockdale . Let the man alone . I stood just about as much as I 'm going to out of you . " So I took my hand off it right quick and it was too much for the little fellow . The bag fell and mighty near knocked him over so I had to catch him to keep him from going down . And then some of the others started crowding around to see what was going on , and I said , " Irvin , I just . . . " but then he started lighting into me again . And it looked like he got rougher every time with it too ; and this time he got started on me saying I thought I was so tough and yet did nt do nothing but pick on fellows half my size . " Cant you find anybody your own size to pick on ? " he said . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 48But then the little fellow got into it himself . He snatched himself up real straight and looked Irvin right in the face and said , " You watch your mouth ! " And it kind of got Irvin a second too . He looked at the little fellow and started to say something else , but then the little one pulled himself up straighter and said , " Why do nt you mind your own business anyhow ? " " I was just trying to do you a favor , fellow , " Irvin said . " This fellow tries to . . . " That 's between him and me , " the little one said . " Nobodyasked you to butt in . " " Now look , I was just trying to help you out , Shorty . I was just ... " And that one really set the little one off . " Who are you calling Shorty ? " he yelled out . " Who asked you anything anyhow ? " " All right , if that 's the way you feel about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you be that way . " " Well , that 's the way , " the little one said . " Just keep out of things that do nt concern you . " It really got Irvin 's goat too , having him talk at him that way . He looked kind of puzzled and started to say something else , but couldnt think of anything to say , so finally all he done was turn around at me again and squench up his eyes and say , " If I have any more trouble out of you , I 'm going to let you know about it , fellow , " and turn and go stomping off to his bunk on the other side of the room . The little one was hopping mad , though . He kept mumbling to himself and pushing around at the bag and everything and I felt pretty good about the way it come out . I knowed I should have tipped him off somehow about Irvin but I did nt have the chance , and to tell you the truth , I49didnt care much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until he finally got the bag up on the top one and then stepped back trying to breathe easy so it would look like it warnt nothing for him to do to be tossing the bag up that way . I said , " You want a cigarette ? " but he shook his head and started to say something , but then had to wait until he got his breath back , so I looked the other way like I did nt notice it , and then he said , " I do nt smoke . It takes your wind away to smoke . Thanks just the same , though . " And then I said kind of low so nobody else could hear , I said , " I guess I should have told you before but I did n't have no chance  --  Irvin has had ROTC . I did nt figger you knowed it . I heered it myself just before we left home . " " That do nt make any difference , " he said . " Well , he must have had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talked . .. " " What do you mean , pretty bad ? It do nt make any differencehow much he had of it  --  if he did n't finish the course and then go ahead and take the Army course afterwards he do nt rank any higher than anybody else . As far as that goes , he ai nt even been swore in yet and even when he does , he wont be no higher than the rest of us because they do nt give out any rank in ROTC until you finish the course . He might act like he has all the rank there is , but I know better . I guess I know how ROTC works all right . I 've read four or five of them ROTC manuals and I know what it amounts to . . . " I listened to him talking about the ROTC and he had to keep going for a good while before it ever come clear to me , but course I wouldnt let on none about it then , I just kept my mouth shut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feeling dumber and dumber , and then I begun to feel right good about it too . I looked over to where Irvin was setting onhis bunk talking to Lucky and some of the others , and in a minute I was feeling right happy about it too . And I do nt guess I could have picked a better one to tell me about it than the little one because he seemed to know more about it than the ROTC theirselves . He knowed how it started and when it started and all like that , and he said he had a cousin that had Cavalry ROTC at the University of Georgia and he knowed another fellow that had Infantry at Dahlonega , and then he started telling me the difference between the two and how he like the Infantry better because they was the real soldiers , and the others warnt nothing but helpers , and all like that . He was down on the others a good bit too , it seemed like , especially the navy . He did nt like them at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Little old white uniforms and walking around on boats and things all the time . You just think about it . " " Yeah , that 's what I always thought , " I said . " The Infantryis the best one . " " There just ai nt any comparison , " he said . " Listen , what about the War between the States ? What about that ? " " Yeah , " I said . " That 's what I always thought too . What about that ? " " That 's what I always say , " he said . " You see what I mean ? " Then he looked over to where Irvin was setting and said , " I 'll bet he ai nt had no moren a year of it , if that much . And it was probably Cavalry or Field Artillery or something like that . I bet it was Field Artillery . " " Well , it do nt do him no good here , " I said . " That 's right . He ai nt no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " He sho ai nt . He ai nt no different from nobody else . " And the more I thought about it , the better I felt . There5o 51I was feeling like a dog for grabbing at him the way I done , and there warnt nothing wrong with him at all . I mean it made me feel good knowing it too . So I thought on it a while , and it was almost enough to make me mad , so I cut out thinking that way soon enough . It did nt do any good to go around fussing with folks nohow . All I wanted to do was just get along with everybody and not have no trouble , and I figgered it would work out sooner or later as long as I was friendly and did nt cause no ruckus or anything , so I made up my mind to forget it . So when we fell out in front of the barracks and got in lines to go eat supper , I spoke to everybody real nice and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still did nt have anything to do with me . And when we got lined up , there was ole Irvin right behind me , and he kept on at me worse than ever . He 'd say , " You straighten up there , " and I 'd work hard at it , and then he 'd say , " Walk in step there , boy , you ai nt behind no plow now , " and would stomp on my heel , and everybody would laugh and take on about it . But I did nt want no trouble and just wanted every- thing to be forgot , so I would kind of chuckle and take on like I thought it was about the funniest thing I ever heered . And then he 'd jab me in the back and things like that , and then kick at my heels some more with everybody heehawing , and I 'd try to heehaw a bit myself , only it was right hard to do with my heel hurting that way , but I heaved my shoul- ders up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I figgered I would just laugh my head off all the time and things would get all right , but when they got started on little Ben too  --  that was the little one 's name , Ben Whitledge  --  I did nt like that too much because he had nt done nothing to nobody . And once we had set down at the table , they kept 52 on at both of us . I chuckled and took on the best I could like I thought they was a mighty sharp bunch all right , but they did nt let up at all . Irvin kept kicking me under the table saying , " Do nt eat so sloppy , boy . You ai nt with hogs now , " and then Lucky would come out with something like , " I 'd fix him a trough but I do nt think the hogs would like it , " which were right funny when you come to think of it , so I did get a good chuckle out of that one , only most of them warnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . And Ben did nt take to any of it much . He set over there , and when they called him " Glass Eye " and stuff like that , he did nt act friendly at all . He wouldnt say a word and finally he finished up and took his tray and got up from the table and left , like he did nt think any of it was funny at all . So I tried to fix it up with Ben when I got back over to the barracks . I did nt come right out and say how he should act or nothing because I seen how stubborn he was , but I took on a good bit about how funny Irvin and Lucky was , only it did nt seem to go over with him too much . I said , " Did you hear that one Lucky said about fixing a hog trough only the hogs wouldnt eat with me ? " and then I rolled back on the bed and laughed about that like I was going to die over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt and did nt say a word . I said , " That ai nt nothing , you ought to have heered some of the good ones they pulled on me on the way up here , " and I heehawed about them some , and then I said something about the way he stomped down on my heels and all , and heaved my shoulders up and down over that one . Only I couldnt really put out on that one because I kept remembering how my heel hurt , but anyhow I chuckled and took on a good while , and he did nt pay no attention53to me at all . He finally just got up and started getting undressed and mumbled to himself , " Well , they just better keep away from me , anyhow . " But I did nt know what else to do so I kept on with it trying to be friendly all that next day . But you couldnt change Ben none much , he was so stubborn that way , so I tried to do for both of us . I giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , and when we got down to the place where they shot you with the needles and they started saying to the medic , " That fellow says you cant hurt him , mister . He says you cant even get it in his arm , " and got the medic in on it too so that he jabbed it nearly all the way up to the hilt , I took on like it was the biggest joke I ever heered of . I laughed and rubbed my arm and said , " Yall sho fixed me up that time . Yessir , I 'm sho gon na get you back for that one  --  hee , hee , hee . " and I laughed some more , and kept trying to wink at Ben . But every time one of them would say anything a little bit out of the way to him , he would turn on them in a second , and when one of them called him " Shorty , " I really thought once or twice he was going to bust them one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was froze in a grin and it did nt do no good at all . The more I giggled and took on , the more they found to do , and before it was over even Ben wouldnt speak to me much . So I seen after a while that something would have to be done . It looked like they just warnt going to let up on neither one of us , and Ben warnt liking it neither . So I set down on the bunk and rolled me a cigarette and tried to figger out what to do . I reckon if it had nt of been for Ben , I could have worked it out by laughing my head off all the time , but he was the stubbornest little devil I ever did see . He set there polishing his belt and stuff , never saying a word to me . And to tell you the truth , I was getting right tired of it myself , when you come right down to it . So what I finally decided was that the only thing I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times . I did nt want to , but the laughing warnt doing no good and Ben was getting the wrong end of it and all like that , and I really did nt feel I had much choice in the matter . So anyhow , that 's what I decided I would do . So what I done , I waited around until after supper and then I went back to the barracks and waited for the chance to come . I mean it wouldnt make no sense to just start bangingaway at them , so I set around waiting for somebody to say something to me . Ben was laying up in his bunk reading and I kept waiting around for a while , but nobody come up . So then I begun singing a little bit , thinking somebody would say something about that , but nobody did , so I cut that out and got up and walked up and down the barracks , bumping into their beds where they was reading or sleeping , stumbling here and there trying to make a racket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really no good ones that I could get upset over . So I went back and set down and smoked a cigarette and tried to think of something else to get them started . I got out my harp and blowed on it a while , blowing pretty loud and missing about every other note until it was so awful sounding that it hurt even my ears , but the only one that bothered was Ben , and he did nt really say nothing , only turned over and covered up his head with his pillow . So I finally decided that the main ones  --  Irvin and Lucky and them  --  warnt around , and that was what the trouble was . They were all in the latrine where they had a card54 55game going on the floor , so that seemed my best bet and I went in there . I stepped on some of the cards going in and then I went over to the sink and turned on the water and let it splash around , singing real loud and all like that , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and done a lot more things like that , but they was all pretty wrapped up in the game and I did nt get a rise out of no- body . So I stumbled around a good bit more and bumped into people and things like that , but it still did nt do no good , so finally I just give it up . I went on back to the bunk and started getting ready for bed , thinking I would just have to wait it out until they got started again . But just about time I started getting off my clothes , Ben got up and took his soap and towel and headed for the la- trine , and in a minute I heered somebody say something to him and him say something back , and then I heered all the talking and laughing and scuffling around and things . So I got up off the bunk and went real slow and easy , kind of tip- toeing back to the latrine , and when I looked in to see what they were doing , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldnt have worked it out no better if I had thought on it all night long . They had Ben down under one of the sinks and had the water running ready to stick his head under it with two or three of them holding him and Ben rassling around trying to get away , and everybody yell- ing and everything . So it looked like a pretty good thing to bang them around for a little bit , and I felt real good about it . I went about closing the door real easy and then I closed up the windows , and none of them seen me until I let the last window down with a bang . Then Irvin turned around and said , " Well , if it ai nt ole plowboy , " and laughed and 56 took on so that the others begun to do the same . And then Irvin said , " What are you doing in here , plowboy ? " and some stuff like that , but then I give him a pretty good scowl and did nt laugh or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I guess then they seen something was different . They kept taking on some , with Irvin still in it more than the rest of them , but I scowled real hard again and took a couple of steps toward them , but I think they really knowed better by that time . Irvin kept saying , " Look at ole plowboy , " and trying to joke about it but the smile had long gone off his face and he had begun shifting his eyes this way and that . Anyhow , they let Ben go about that time , and I kept looking at Irvin until all of a sudden he drawed back real quick and said , " You better watch it , boy , there 's six of us here and . . . " but he did nt get to finish because I tapped him one with my left so he quit right in the middle of it as his head popped sideways and backward and he kind of wobbled across the room and dropped over a sink and did nt get up no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was all going to make a break for it , but I managed to stop them all right , though . I grabbed the first one that got to the door by the shoulder and swung him around and busted him a pretty good one , harder than I meant to , so that he kind of sailed across the room and banged up against the wall and slid down and set there for a while . And about that time one of them climbed on my back so that I just jumped up in the air and come down on top of him and heered all the air gush out of him , and then I seen old Irvin getting back up again . So I stepped past the others real quick and swung one at his jaw , but not as hard as I had the other one because I did nt want him to be just laying there the whole time ; he went back-57ward and flipped over one of the bowls and ended up in pretty much the same position he had the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could ask and it turned out to be a pretty good fight after all . I went around with the others a little bit and finally hemmed a couple of them up in the corner and acted like I was going to hit one that had his face covered up with his hands , but dodged aside and hit the other one instead , and then had to chase the other one for the door again . I grabbed him by the foot and give it a snatch and he went up and banged down on his stomach and I picked him up and tried to see how far I could chunk him and managed to hit the wall on the other side of the room . But that busted one of the mirrors and made a good bit of noise , and things kind of dwindled off a bit after that . Irvin got up one more time before it was over and then another fellow got up , but there warnt much else to it , except for Lucky over in the corner and little Ben had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and was doing pretty good , so I did nt bother with it none . I set down and rolled a cigarette and smoked it until Ben had finished up with Lucky , and then both of us set around waiting for them to get up again . Little ole Ben was kind of prancing around all that time too , doinghis fist in and out and taking deep breaths and things , and he had this big grin on his face , so it did make me feel a lot better . I said , " How you doing , Ben ? " And he kind of flexed his muscles , or what he had of them , and said , " Fine . Fine , " and it really made me feel good to watch it . It had been a lot of trouble and some of them might be mad with me for a few days , and the place was a mess with cards and glass and cigarettes and matches all over the floor , but it seemed like it was worth it . Ben was58prancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as proud as he could be and strutted around like a little bantam rooster . Anyhow , we set around for them to get up and then opened the door and let them all go to bed , all except Irvin who still had nt come to real good . I told a couple of them to go back and help him along , but they warnt quite up to it , so me and Ben finally had to do it ourselves . Ben warnt able to handle much more than one foot , but he done a good job with that , and we got him to bed all right . We tucked him in and then got in bed ourselves , and I felt real comfortable and a lot better , and knowed I would sleep pretty good . I had nt had no exercise to speak of for the last day or two and it was right good to feel wore out for a change . I turned over and guess I was asleep in four or five seconds at the outside . Anyhow , it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really mad at all . I got up early , beforeBen did , and went down to the latrine , and there wasseveral of them in there and they acted real polite to me . They was kind of shy at first , though . When I first come in , 59this fellow stopped shaving and stared at me , and I nodded " Good morning , " but he just stood there with the razor in his hand and his mouth open . So I reached up to give him a pat on the back to be friendly , but time I got my arm up , he give a jump and ducked his head and dived past me , rolling up in the corner and setting there with the soap still on his face , holding onto the razor . So I seen he was right shy and eased back away from him and stepped over to one of the bowls to wash up , but then I seen this rag already there and this fat fellow by the name of Pete standing there watching me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I did nt mean to take it . " And he jumped and said , " You go ahead . I ai nt in any hurry . " " No , I 'll wait until you finish . " " I ai nt in any hurry , " he said . But I stepped back and let him go ahead , and he acted mighty nice about it . He did nt take long at all , only leaned over and splashed some water on his face and grabbed up his stuff real quick and said , " There you go . I 'm all done . Thanks a lot . " " Much obliged to you , " I said . So they all acted real shy and polite like that , and as friendly as you could ask . One time I mentioned something about the cards all over the floor , and before I got it half out of my mouth , there was four of them scurrying around and picking them up and straightening up the place . Anyhow , I went ahead washing and begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others sidled up next to me and took to washing too ; and then I finished and went back to get Ben up . But he seemed to be sleeping mighty hard and when I shook him , he only grunted and didnt6omove . So I decided to let him rest a little longer and went over to get Irvin up ; and when I got over there , I seen he did nt look so good . The side of his face was about the color of coal dust and his lip was swoll up a pretty good bit , but I knowed he would feel better if he got something to eat , so I shook him until his eyes opened . I said , " You best get up , Irvin , or you might miss breakfast , " and for a minute there , I thought he was right mad with me because he just kept staring at me , and then give a little moan and closed his eyes up real tight and wouldnt even look at me except to peep out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move until I had gone back over to get Ben up , and then he got up right quick and headed for the latrine , going right fast . Anyhow , I kept shaking Ben and telling him he was goingto be late for breakfast , but he only grunted at me . I shook him and said , " Come on , Ben . The chicken 's done crowed and wants to water , " and then he opened his eyes and frowned a little bit and kind of looked toward the ceiling . " Come on , " I said , because he did nt make any move to get up , just kept laying there . " What 's the matter with you ? " I asked , because then I started getting worried one of them had hurt him last night . " We got to get going . It 's late . " And then he rolled his head over and pushed back the covers and set up , his eyes kind of blank-looking and his hair hanging down in his face , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " and climbed out of the bed without saying another word to me . And it kind of bothered me the way he acted  --  the thing was , Ben warnt usually slow-moving like that . I mean usuallyhe was running around polishing things and straighten-6iing things , so it did nt seem natural to him . He dumb out of the bed and begun putting on his shoes , moving as slow as I ever seen him ; and then stood there on one foot wobbling as he put on his pants ; and then picked up his soap and towel and headed back for the latrine , just kind of dragging himself along . And he stayed back there until we was already outside getting lined up ready to go for breakfast . I kept watching the door waiting for him until I got right fidgety about it ; so finally I went back inside to get him , and when I got there , he was standing back by his bunk , putting on his shirt like he had all the time in the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , " I told him . " I never seen you so slow . " He kept putting on his shirt , buttoning it up one little button at the time . Then he yawned and said , " I did nt sleep much last night . " " I slept good , " I said . " I ai nt slept so good in a long time . " " I did too at first , but then I waked up and got to thinking and did nt go back to sleep for a while . " " You did ? " I said . " How come you done that ? " " I do nt know , " he said . " I just did . " Then he was about ready to say something else , but we heered them outside ready to march off about that time , and we had to start run- ping to catch up with them . Anyhow , we had a good breakfast and I et more than I had in a long time . I et what they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee on account of his jaw , and I et his , and then I et some of Lucky 's too that he couldnt get down , so I had a pretty good breakfast for a change . But Ben did nt hardly eat a thing . He just picked at it with his fork and busted the yellow of his egg and stirred 62 his coffee a lot , and all the time kept staring at his plate like it made him mad even to be there . And in a minute , he got up and took his tray and left the mess hall without saying a word to me , and went back to the barracks all by himself . And when I got back , he was laying up in the bunk staring at the ceiling again . So I set down and did nt bother him none about it ; but after a while it begun to grind at me , and when everybody had gone down to the orderly room to sign some papers , I lit a cigarette and puffed on it a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was bothering him . He kind of twisted around and said , " It ai nt nothing . I just did nt get much sleep . " " Did any of them hurt you last night ? " " No . No , it ai nt that . . . It 's . . . " But then he just said , " Awww . . . " and turned his head the other way . So I waited a bit , and then he set up real quick and looked at me and said , " Will , you shouldnt have done it . You shouldnt . . and then stopped again , and said , " Awww . . . " and laid back down again . " What ? I shouldnt have done what ? " But he kept shaking his head back and forth . " What is it I shouldnt have done , Ben ? You just tell me , I 'll . . . " It ai nt no use . It warnt your fault . " " I bet it was , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , Ben ? " " You wouldnt understand . It warnt your fault because you just did nt know any better and I did nt help none . I did nt . . . Awwww . . . " You tell me , Ben , " I said . " I 'll fix it . You tell me . " " Awww . . . " he said . " You . . . " and then he bounced 63up ' again and slapped his hand on the bed and said , " Dog it , Will . Dog it , " which sounded pretty powerful coming from Ben and made me jump . He said , " Dog it , Will , it might have messed up everything . Here I done come up here and kept my mouth shut and ai nt done a thing to nobody , and then I figgered that you and me . . . well , I did nt have no right to think it , but I thought you might be willing and I got bad eyes and thought I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are bound to hear about it . They are just bound to . " They what ? Who ? " " Somebody 's bound to tell them about last night and then what ? Then what ? You think they want folks in the Infantry that acts like that , Will . No sir , they do nt want to have anything to do with them . They want folks what can take it and keep their mouths shut , the way a man ought to do . Oh , it warnt your fault . I done just like you did , once it got started . But it warnt right , Will , it warnt . . . A soldier do nt do things like that , Will . A soldier . . . you see , a soldier , well , he do nt have to go around getting in little fusses in latrines with anybody that comes along cause he just got off the battlefield where there 's real fighting and what does he care about some little ole fight in a latrine when . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will , cause he 's just been on the battlefield and he do nt have to go around strutting and fussing . . . Do nt you see , Will ? " " Well , not quite , " I said . " We ai nt been on no . .. " " Awww , I knowed you wouldnt understand , " Ben said . " But just listen now , Will , and try . You see , they do nt want little folks like that in the Infantry , and I . . . Listen , my great-grandpa was under Stonewall Jackson in the Battle of Chancellorsville and he even knowed him and Stonewall64give him a medal one time that I still got at home , and his brother was with Forrest , and my Dad , Will , my Dad was in the Rainbow Division , and I had two brothers in the last war and all of them was in the Infantry , and now suppose I do nt make it because of last night . They do nt want soldiers what blow up like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his little ole white pants and fight in latrines and act real little , but he had nt just come off no battlefield , Will ; and a man in the Air Force , he ai nt been right down in it and it do nt make no difference with him , but a soldier , a real honest Infantry soldier that 's been in real fighting on the battlefield . . . Look , Will , you see what I mean ? You see ? " " Kind of , " I said . " Except this about the battlefield , Ben . . . That do nt make right good sense to me because ... " " I knowed you wouldnt understand . Dog it , listen , Will . Listen , " and he leaned way over and looked at me and said , " They might put us in the navy and we 'd have to wear them little white uniforms , or they might even put us in the Coast Guard or the Air Force . . . Will , do you know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do nt think I heered say . " " They call ' em . . . " and he waited a minute and kind of twisted his face and said , " They call ' em airmen . By dog , Will , do nt you see ? How 'd you like to be called an airman ? " " By God , I just do nt think I 'd stand for it . . . " " You 'd have to ! " Ben said . " That 's what you would be ! " He was leaning so far over the side of the bed by that time that he might near fell off and caught himself just in time , but that kind of quieted him down a little bit . He set back and said , " That 's what I mean , Will . They 're bound to hear about what happened last night , and we wont get in the65Infantry at all . One of them will let it slip and then . . . " No , they wont , Ben . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back and whomp him good and . . . " " Now there you go again , Will ! Did nt I just tell you ? Besidesthat , it might be somebody else and they might have already told , because there was a whole barracks full of them that know it by now . There ai nt nothing that you can do and there ai nt nothing I can do . We 'll just have to wait and see . " " Well , I do nt think they will . I wouldnt worry about it none . " " Well , I just want you to know one thing . I ai nt blaming you for it because I was in it just as much as you was . But it does look like to me . . . " and he kind of turned his head away . " It does look like with me having bad eyes and all that they would take me , do nt it ? I mean , it does look like they wouldnt hold a little something like that against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things , just like they want in the Infantry . . . " " Sho , " I said . " I do nt see how they could do that to you . " " Well , we 'll just have to wait and see , " he said . " Well , I wouldnt worry about it none . " " I ai nt , " he said . " I 'll just wait and see , " but he set there studying his fingernails and picking at a string hanging down from his sleeve , and I knowed he was going to worry because he was real stubborn that way when he got set on something , and was going to worry no matter what anybody said. 668So we laid around in the barracks doing nothing for the next two days , and it was the hardest waiting I ever done in my life . Ben got worse and worse about it as time passed and I waited pretty hard myself , but I would forget and ease up every once in a while and get to talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine with the others by then , and not even think about it until I turned around and saw Ben laying there on the bunk . But then I would quit and go lay down and wait myself , and it got to be pretty wearing . They kept posting assignments on the bulletinboard outside the orderly room , and every once in a while somebody would come in and say , " There 's another list up , " and everybody would run out to look at it . Then sometimes they would come back and one of them would be grinning because he got in the Coast Guard or something , and there might be another one in the Air Force , and he 'd whoop and holler , and then we would sit around some more , waiting for the lists . And I waited as hard as I could , but sometimes I would get out my harp and play a few tunes on it , though I usually tried not to play nothing lively , only once in a while I forgot and did . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Sleeping , " and those like that , which were quiet enough , only I would sometimes get to sparking it up some when I67warnt thinking ; and the second afternoon this fellow come in whooping and hollering because his name had been posted on a list for the navy , and I played " Tennessee Shuffle Dance , " for him while he done a right good buck dance , and I think I could have enjoyed it ifn it had nt of been for Ben , laying there staring at the ceiling that way . But later we went down to see the list and Irvin 's and Pete 's names was on it for the Air Force and they banged each other on the back for a while , and then Ben began feeling some better about things because they still had nt posted one for the Infantry , and there warnt many of us left . He looked at the list and give a sigh , so I give one back at him ; and then we went back to the barracks and waited for another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybodygoing down except that somebody might think you couldnt read if you did nt , but we all went down because everybody was getting right anxious by that time . And then they posted two more Air Force lists , and it got to be right fun with everybody whooping and hollering and going on , just like a party or something . So we hung around the barracks all that afternoon and in a little while it was nearly four o'clock and they still had nt posted an Infantry list , and Ben began to perk up a good bit . He begun pacing around some and at four-thirty we went outside to watch them close down the office for the day ; and then Ben looked at me and kind of shook his head , grinninga little bit . So I whopped him a good one on the back and he whopped at me too , and we went back inside where everybody was talking about where they were going . They had nt knowed each other moren five days , some of them , but they got each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all like that , and it was good being amongst them , 68even though by that time me and Ben figgered we 'd never see none of them no more because we would be in the Infantry . And everybody was feeling mighty good by that time so when we fell out in front to go down to supper , just as we was getting lined up , I said , " Why do nt you march us down , Ben ? " and some of the others chimed in on it too . But Ben turned red in the face and shook his head , and said , " Aw , we cant march yet . " " Sho we can if you march us , " I said , and then Irvin said , " Go ahead , Ben , " and even though he kept shaking his head sideways , we shoved him out front and got in line there waiting for him . Lucky said , " Come on and tell us to do something , " and Irvin said , " Yeah , you just call ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else started calling out too because they was so full of spark and everything , and wanted to try some real marching this time because all we usually done was just line up and start walking . So Ben finally give in to them and tried it . He snatchedhimself up real straight with his back in a curve and yelledout , " All right , Attention ! " but it did nt come out so good  --  it only kind of squeaked out and did nt sound powerful the way it was supposed to , so he got all red in the face againand started to quit . But everybody kept on at him so finallyhe said , " All right then . Get ready . . . Attention ! " andeverybody was kind of expecting it this time and got indifferent kinds of stiff positions with their hands down bytheir sides , and it looked pretty good . The only one thatdidnt look much good was this fellow Pete up in the frontline  --  what he done was spread his legs out about two feetapart and put his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nt look much like the others , and they had kind of an argument about it . Irvin told him that warnt no way to stand at attention , but Pete said he knowed it was because he had seen it before . " No , that ai nt the way , " Lucky said . " You stand real stiff and hold your hands down beside your side . Ai nt that right , Irvin ? " " Yeah , that 's parade rest you 're doing , Pete . " But Pete said , " Naw , what you 're doing is parade rest . This is attention like this . You stand with your legs all spraddled out and put your hands behind you . That 's the way to stand at attention . " So then they argued about it a while longer until Pete got right mad about it before it was over . He said , " You remember that picture Wake Island when the Major come up to the fellow and said Attention ' and the fellow looked around and give a jump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You remember that ? " " No , I do nt remember that , but I still do nt see how you are going to march . . . " Well , I do , " Pete said . " And if you do nt , why do nt you just keep quiet about it ? " But except for Peter trying to march spraddle-legged the way he done , everybody marched real good once we got to going . Ben give us a " Left face " and everybody turned to the left , and those that did nt got straightened out soon enough , and then he give us , " Forward march ! " And then he begun calling out , " Keep in step . Keep in step , " and everybody tried to do that , only there warnt much agreementon it and there got to be some shoving around until Ben started going , " Left . Right . Left . Right , " and got everybodystraightened out again. 70Anyhow , Ben was something to watch after a little bit too . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right , " like that , and after a while it seemed that his voice kind of changed somehow so it sounded right powerful , and he did nt even look like himself no more . He was rared back and strutting real big with his knees going way up and his arms swinging and his head throwed back , and his voice gettinglouder all the time . Before we got down to the end of the barracks , he was going , " Hut , two , three , four . Left foot on one . Hut , two three , four , " just like he was borned doing it . And then he called out , " You had a good home and you left ! " and Irvin come right back at him , yelling , " Right " " You had a good wife and you left ! " " Right . " And then Ben went , " Hut , two , three , four ! " and it sounded real snappy too . And then they done this other one that went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hut , two , three , four ! " " Hand me some whisky and hand me some more ! " " Hut , two , three , four ! " But then somebody went , " Get out of here and do nt you ever again come back any more ! " which kind of messed the whole thing up and got everybody on the wrong foot again and mighty near finished us off . But Ben started calling out , " Left . Right , " again until we got straightened back out and by the time we got to the mess hall , people was watching us from the other barracks with their heads poked out and waving , especially the ones that had just come in . We got to the corner and Ben give us a turn to the right which was the wrong direction , but nobody cared , so we just circled the block one time and come up on71the mess hall on the other side . Ben called out , " Detail , halt ! " and then , " Fall out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you ever heered so that you might wonder how somebody so little could yell so loud . And Ben was right proud of it too . You could see it all over him . I come up to him after we stopped and said , " My goodness , Ben , where on earth did you ever learn to be such a marcher ? " and he kind of shuffled around a little bit and turned his face away , and said , " There ai nt nothing to that . You can learn that anywhere . " " Not the way you done it , " I said . " Let 's go and eat , " he said . So you can figger about how he felt when we finished eatingand went back to the barracks and just happened to pass the bulletin board and seen our names on it . We was in the Air Force and was going to be shipped out with the others . Somebody had sneaked out there and put it up while we was eating . It seemed like a mighty low-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do about it . We went on back to the barracks and Ben climbed up in his bunk again and I did nt say nothing at all . I got out my harp and played on it a while , and even when I played " Saturday Night in Rocky Bottom , " I did nt make it lively like I usually did , but let it drag real easy and quiet , like it did nt have no more spark to it than some hymn you sing at a funeral. 7R9Anyhow , they shipped us out on the train the next morning and rode us all that day , and Ben was about as miserable as a man could get . He set there staring out the window at the fields , not like he was seeing them , but like he was just lettingthem pass in front of his eyes ; and he rode that same way all the next day too , and I got right worried about him . I tried to perk him up by pointing out things , and when we finally stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , and we seen the planes circling over the town , I tried to get him interested in them too . Everybody was watching them and talking about them , calling them babies and all , and saying how this one could really zoom around and how this other one did nt have much speed but was really staunch and stuff like that , so I went over and said , " Look , Ben , that baby really climbs , do nt it ? " and made on over it a good bit like the others were doing . I throwed in a lot of Rogers and Wilcos and things , and then I seen this other one come over and said , " Look , Ben , that baby sho flies fast , do nt it ? " But he only looked kind of disgusted and said , " Fast ? That 's a cub and it couldnt go no moren ninety miles an hour if it wanted to ! " And I said , " Ben , how on earth did you ever learn so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that too , 78but he just set there on his barracks bag and wouldnt even look at them no more . Anyhow , we finally got on this truck and headed out for the field , and it was as pretty a town as I ever seen . We rode down along this street next to the water that is called the Gulf and everybody was laying around in bathing suits in the sun , and swimming and everything , and we had a barrel of fun all the way through . We rode along and yelled at all the girls , and everybody whistled and took on and made a lot of funny remarks like : " I 'll take that one for Christmas , " and " Buy that one for me , " and all sorts of things that would tickle you , only it did nt tickle the girls much , only one of them who smiled back kind of sour and said , " Battlewearyrecruits , " which was right funny when you come to think of it as we had n't been in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that one and laughed over it a good bit , but the rest of them did nt ; they only kind of mumbled to theirselvesand quit yelling at everybody . Anyhow , when we got inside the field and stopped , there was planes all over the place , coming down low past the buildings , taking off and landing ; and you could hear them down on the runway , roaring and blasting , the loudest things you ever heered , so I got to taking on about them again . I said , " Looker yonder , Ben , that baby 's doing a chandell , " which I had heered one of them say , and some stuff like that , and finally got him interested a little bit . And just as he was hopping down off the truck , a plane come roaring over the top of one of the buildings with its wheels down , so low that you could see the pilot 's head sticking up in it , and I yelled out , " How 'd you like to fly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldnt it ? " and he kind of nodded his head , watching it , and said , " Yeah , " so that Itook on a good bit longer about it . I said it wouldnt be long before he was zooming all over the sky himself in one of them , saying Roger and Wilco and everything like that , and patted him on the back , and begun to feel right good thinkingabout it myself . I could just see Ben setting up there in one of them planes with his scrawny little head in one of them helmets , with caps and goggles and all , and I was just on the verge of saying something casual about how you couldnt fly no planes in the Infantry , when I heered this fellowcalling out , " Will Stockdale . Which one of you is Will Stockdale ? " We was lined up by then and this fellow was standing out in front of us with a piece of paper in his hand with two or three others looking on . He called it out again and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with : " That 's me you calling when you call that name , " which I thought up right off the bat like that . " You Will Stockdale ? " Then I ripped off one I heered Pa tell one time that went : " That 's what my Ma called me and I never knowed her to lie ! " and everybody got a real big kick out of it and laughed and took on , only the fellow with the paper , he did nt ; he only looked at me kind of sickly and said , " All right . All right . If you 're Will Stockdale , you go with this fellow here . The rest of you stay lined up there . " Anyhow , I did nt know quite what was going on for a few seconds after that . I was standing there holding my bag and did nt move out of the line . But then the fellow started yellingat me , " Did nt you hear me ? I said for you to go with this fellow here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioning to me to come with him . But Ben and them was ready to march off about that time , 74 75so I shook my head at him and stayed in line . But then this fellow come on over to me , saying something I couldnt make out , so I tried to explain to him how I planned to go on with Ben and them . I said , " If it 's all the same to you , I 'll just go on with them , if you do nt mind , " and acted real polite about it , but he stood there jabbering at me and then grabbed onto my bag , and then this other one come over jabbering too , and the first thing I knowed , there was Ben and them marchingaway . So I turned to go with them , only this fellow was still holding my bag , and it looked like I was going to have to knock his head off to make him let go ; but about that time I seen Ben waving at me as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , so I did nt hit him or nothing , just give him a little jab in the ribs with my elbow so that he kind of gasped and turned blue in the face and staggered around a little bit . But he still held onto the bag somehow , and when I looked back around , Ben and them had got out of sight around a building somewhere , and I did nt even know which way they went . So I did nt do nothing then . I just stood there and listened to them jabber for a while until one of them said , " Look , fellow , lets do nt start nothing now . I tell you what you do . You tell the Captain about it . He told me you were to be assigned down there ; it warnt my idea . . . " So I said , " Well , where is he then and I 'll tell him , " and the fellow said , " You just go with Ringo here and he 'll explain the whole thing to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " which was foolish as I warnt wanting no trouble with nobody and had been just as polite as I knowed how . Anyhow , they kept talking about it and we stood around a bit while they kept pounding the fellow who had grabbed my bag on the back , trying to get the breath back into him , 76and the one called Ringo said , " Comawn , " or something like that , so I finally went along with him . And while we was walking along , he tried to tell me what it was all about and was right nice about it , but I found out soon enough he couldnt explain anything much ; and I do nt guess he talked more than a minute like that before I figgered out that the trouble with him was that he was a Yankee . He tried right hard , though , and I nodded my head up and down like I understood him , and did nt let on that I knowed what he was or anything , figgering when I got down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Only it warnt long after I got there that I found out the place was full of Yankees . The one called Ringo showed me to a cot I was supposed to use , and they were just coming in from drill at the time with their brogans and fatigues and dust all over them , chattering the way they do . So I set down on the edge of the bunk and rolled a cigarette and waited to ask somebodyabout the Captain . And they kept coming in , knocking the dust off and trying to talk , but not making much headwayat it , so I kept looking for somebody I could make some sense out of . But all of them just seemed to squeak and jabberat one another , waving their arms around and kind of talking through their noses so it hurt your ears somehow , and there was a couple of them trying to cuss which was the most comical sounding thing I ever listened to  --  it was Holy this , or Holy that , or Jemminy something-or-other , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word out of the whole thing . They was even worse than Bart , but they did try mighty hard , and I kind of admired the way they stuck at it , even though you couldnt make no sense out of most of it . Anyhow , I still wanted to find the Captain so I sidled u " next to One or vivo of them and listened in , thinking it might help if I got closer , only it did nt ; it only hurt your ears more ; so I set around until I seen one that warnt jabbering so much and I went over to him and said , " Howdy " and he looked around and said , " Howrrr " which was about as close as he could get to " Howdy " but which sounded a lot better than the others anyhow , so I asked him . I said , " You by any chance know where I can find the Captain ? " And he said something like , " Urr besee surgen King furrz , " which I found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So then I had to sit around until about three that afternoon to wait for Sergeant King . I laid around and blew on my harp and smoked and slept a while , but I finally got pretty tired of it and started getting anxious to get things straightened out . I started pacing around , feeling right orneryabout things , and was going to tell them right out how I felt about things and get it over with and not have no more foolishness about it . But time I seen Sergeant King , I knowed I couldnt do it that way because he was about the saddest-looking man I ever looked at . He had one of these long , thin faces something like a hound dog 's and eyes something like a hound dog 's too , and I felt kind of sorry for him time I looked at him . He come in and went into this little room up in the front of the barracks that he had by himself and when I come in , he was setting on his bunk with his face all droopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , I went at it real gentle and acted as polite as I could . I told him who I was and that I had just come in and so on , and he looked up and asked me what I wanted , and I told him I78wanted to see the Captain as I did nt plan to stay in this squadron but go up to the one that Ben and them was in , and felt like I ought to let them know about it . But it affected him pretty bad just the same . He started mumbling to himself , rubbing his hands over his face , lookingsadder than ever . He looked up at me and said , " I figgeredit was you . Yessir , I should have knowed it time you walked in . They said they was sending you down here . And I should have knowed it would be somebody who thinks he can decide not to stay around no more , and will just tell the Captain about it . The fact is , they send every bum and idiot they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make human beings out of them  --  I never get anything but eight balls in this barracks and now they send me down one who says he 's going to another squadron , and just feels like he ought to come by and tell us about it . " " Well , I 'm mighty sorry to hear about all that , " I said . " I wish there was something I could do about it . " " I know that helps a lot . " " Sho , " I said . " Hit must be a mess having nothing but bums around and I would sholy like to help you out , only I figgered to be with Ben and them , you see . It ai nt nothing against you , you see . It 's just that . . . And that 's where I made my mistake too because his face beamed and he began shaking his head sideways like he just couldnt believe it , and then he busted in on me saying how decent it was of me and all like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took on that way for quite a while . And before it was over , I was hung for good . He seemed to appreciate it so much and everything ; he patted me on the back and said how fine he thought it was I had decided to79stay around and all like that , so there warnt a thing I could say then without making him feel pretty bad about everything . So we chatted a good while that way , saying good things to each other , and I told him how nice it was to meet somebody with good manners , who knowed how to be polite , and he said he felt the same and appreciated all I was doing ; and after a little bit of that , he finally said , " Well , I guess you better go make up your bunk being as you decided to stay around a while . " And I said , " Sho , and if I was you , I just wouldnt worry about the barracks no more . I 'll pitch right in and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I reached out and popped him on the back and made out I was right glad I had decided to stay too , because I might as well have , being as I was stuck anyhow , even though I really did nt care too much about it at all , when you come right down to it. 10Anyhow , I stayed around the place a few days because of Sergeant King . I went out and drilled some and begun to get along all right with the others , and they begun to talk some8obetter so I could understand them , but all that time , I had nt seen Ben or them anywhere . And it was kind of a strain beingaround Yankees and not letting on I suspected it , so one day I took off and started hunting . I went all over the field two or three times and asked everybody I seen , through the PX and out to the firing range and all up and down the barracks , but I did nt see a one of them . I started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , and when I got back I was pretty wore out . So I went and laid down on the bunk to rest , but in a little bit Sergeant King come in and said , " I hear you do nt like it here with us no more , Stockdale , " which kind of surprised me as I did nt think he knowed I had left . So I turned to him and said that warnt so , I liked it fine . And he said , " Well , that 's good because I was just scared you might not . Yessir , you had me worried today not showingup for drill . I hope you are feeling all right . You ai nt sick or nothing ? " " No , " I said , " I was just laying down , all wore out mainly . " So he said that was mighty good , that he did nt want me to be sick because he had picked me out to go on KP and was scared I wouldnt be up to it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it seemed like you were just the man for the job , being as you decided to stay with us . " " Well , I do nt know nothing about it , " I said . " But I 'd sho be willing to try . " And he said , " Oh , they 'll teach you all right . I got confidence in you , Stockdale . I 'll bet you make one mighty good KP ; in fact , I might even arrange for you to go tomorrow too so you can really learn it good . " Well , I did nt care too much about it , but I did nt let on8ihe was happy and smiling again and everything . So I told him I did nt see how on earth he could ever figger that I did nt like his squadron , and who on earth would ever tell him a thing like that , and he listened , smiling , and said , " Well , we 're mighty glad to have you too , Stockdale . Yessir , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the place , he was whistling to himself , so I guess it come off all right . So anyhow that night I went on KP and there really warnt much to it that I did nt already know . I washed a good many dishes and then I helped clear up the tables and mop the floors , and along toward midnight they give me some potatoesto peel , and there 's nothing I care for more than raw potatoes , so I et a good many of them ; and later on they give me some carrots to take the heads off of , and that 's another thing I 'm pretty partial to , raw carrots , so I et a good many of them too , so by the time it was daylight , I was right full and did nt care for much breakfast at all , and only et a little moren one helping . But I had been up all day and night by that time and was right tired , so I felt like sleeping some , but when I got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and he wanted to know how I done and all , and I told him without bragging none ; and then he said he had fixed it so I could get back on for the day shift too . I really did nt care nothing about it , but he stood there slapping me on the back and grinning and everything , so I went on back like he said . And this time they let me work in the kitchen where they was having meat loaf and cabbage for dinner and those are things I always liked , so I did nt mind too much for a while , and kind of enjoyed nibbling here and there . I helped myselfuntil I got tired of it , and then I went over to help this82fellow cut up some apples , and worked at that for a while , and et a good many , and was getting along all right until this cook came running over yelling , " Do nt let that fellow get in them apples ! " and made a lot of noise about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant afford to have him in here no longer , " so then I went out back and did nt get work in the kitchen no more . So after that it got kind of tiresome because they put me on the garbage detail and I had to turn these cans upside down and wipe them out with newspapers , and then rinse them out with water and stuff like that ; and keeping my head down in those cans that way kind of took my appetite away so I did nt eat much dinner at all . And later on that afternoon , when I started cleaning them out again , my stomachstarted hurting . It hurt all that afternoon and before it was over , I warnt liking KP so much , and was right glad when it was time to go , as I was right tired too . I was going to lay down and not even move until the next morning , the way I felt . It was about dark and I just dragged myself back to the barracks , so to speak . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoes off , I felt somebody punching me and looked up and there was Sergeant King again . I was just dozing off at the time , and there he was grinning at me and a whole bunch of them standing around , so it was something like a dream you wake up to . I could hear Sergeant King talking and I blinked my eyes some trying to rouse , but finally give it up as I just did nt feel up to it at the time , no matter what he thought . So I finally just told him to go on and let me alone , I wanted to sleep a bit . But then I heered him say something about wanting me83to go back on KP again , but I really did nt feel up to it at the time , and I finally just turned over and told him right fiat that I did nt care a thing about it . He turned around and grinned at the others and said , " You do nt , huh ? " And I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You get somebody else this time . " But he just stood there shaking his head at me , and wouldnt listen to a word I was saying . So then I told him straight out how I felt about things . I said , " You leave me alone and I 'll leave you alone . " " I 'll leave you alone all right if you do nt get up off that bunk . " And I said , " That 's good then , " and turned back over on my side and propped my pillow under my head and started to go back to sleep . He wouldnt stop , there , though , like he ought to have . No , he stood there and started cussing and taking on and said what did I think I was , and said I warnt a decent airmanat all , and said , " They bring folks like you in and pay ' em more money than you could sell all the hoecakes you ever et for , and I have to watch out for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way which kind of surprised me because he was so polite before . But I did nt hold it against him none . I laid back and looked at him as long as I could keep my eyes open , and then I shook myself wide awake enough to explain to him how I felt . I said , " As far as that goes , if they do nt want to pay me no money and do nt want me here , they can sho send me back home if they want to because one thing I like is hoecakes anyhow , as far as that goes . . . " 84But then he yelled out , " By God , do n't you get smart with me ! " " What do you mean ? I ai nt getting smart , and why does it worry you if I do nt go on KP because they gon na get the dishes washed if I ai nt there just like they are if I am , and it do nt make any difference to me whether they do or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to send me on back home , that 's all right with me too . I never wanted no trouble about it . " And you should have heered him after that . He stood there with his face getting red and then he started carrying on so much , you wouldnt have thought it was the same man . He begun pointing his finger in my face and calling me cuss words that I had nt even heered before . You couldnt sleep if you tried with him taking on that way , and I did nt see much sense in it . So I finally got up off the bunk and told him , " Now there ai nt no sense in making all that noise and taking on like that , Sergeant King . There ai nt any sense in it at all . " And he backed off , saying , " Stockdale , you take a swing at me and you wont ever hear the rest of it as long as you live . " But I warnt going to hit him if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing off and then he started that cussing again , so I stopped because I warnt going to chase him to hit him , and just so he left me alone was all I wanted , so I said , " You know you ought not to act like that . What makes you cuss me that way ? I do nt think you got any businessacting that way . " " Look , Stockdale , I think it will be many a day before you ever learn enough about the Air Force to know what any-85body 's business is . You better find out what you are talking about first . " So I said , " Well , that 's all right . That 's what I 'll do . I 'll go up and ask the Captain if you can cuss me that way and ifn he says you can , hit might be all right for a little while , but ifn he says you cant , me and you are going to tangle up together . " He stood there looking at me for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally said , " Well , you ought to know you cant talk to a noncom that way . " " I ai nt talked no way . I talked just as nice as I know how . If I said anything that did nt sound nice , you tell me what it is and I wont say it any more . " So he talked around some more , but begun settling down real nice , and said , " Why do nt you want to go on KP any-how ? " " Because my stomach aches and I do nt feel up to it . ' So he looked at me some more and then turned around and looked at all the others and nodded his head and then grinned and said , " Why did nt you say so in the first place ? If you 're going on sick call , you do nt have to go on KP . If you 're going on sick call . . . " " I warnt going on sick call , " I said . " I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grinned around at the others again , settlingdown some more , and then he chuckled and said , " He thought if you went on sick call , you had to go on KP anyhow . " Then he laughed some and said , " You ever heard anything like that before ? " and laughed some more like it was real funny and like he had nt heered nothing more comical in his life , but none of the others did , they only looked at him ; and then he chuckled some more and wiped the tears86out of his eyes and stopped and said right quick , " Well , you better be sure to get your name on the sick book in the morning then , understand ? " " Sho , I 'll go on sick call if you want me to . " And then he kind of drawed himself up and yelled out , " And next time you go on sick call , you let me know . I want to be notified in advance ! " And then he turned around real quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty mad again . He acted awful peculiar that way , and it was a surprise to everybody . They got out of his way and nobody said a thing until the door had slammed , and then they got to takingon like they did nt have good sense . They whooped and hollered like crazy people and one of them drawed himself up and yelled out , " I want to be notified in advance ! " and they whooped and hollered some more . And then one of them come over and started slapping me on the back , and ifn he had nt been such a fool , I wouldnt have liked it none . He yelled out , " I wouldnt have took nothing for it ! Not nothing in the world ! " and slapped me again on the back , but I just ignored him ; I did nt want to sound mean or nothing , but when he slapped me again , I told him , " If your stomach hurt like mine , you wouldnt think it was so funny . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach ache nohow . " Anyhow , they took on that way a good while , giggling and everything , and I got undressed and got in to bed , and did nt pay no more attention to them . I was wore out , and I guess I must have gone to sleep in a few minutes after that. 8711I had a good night 's sleep that night but when I woke up the next morning , I still felt ornery somehow . I went and had breakfast and then went on sick call like Sergeant King wanted me to do and I got in the wrong line and got shot with the needles again , and then I got out of that line and got in the right one , and this time when I come up to the desk the fellow said , " Havent you already been on sick call ? " and I said I had but that they had shot me with the needles again and what I had come for was a stomach ache , but he said , " Well , you cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You better come back tomorrow . " So I left because I did nt have no stomach ache anyhow by that time , and did nt care much , but I still felt down somehow , and just couldnt get out of it . It warnt that I had nothing against Sergeant King neither because he was nice as he could be the next morning . He said how he did nt mean to talk to me like he did and all like that , and I 've never been one to hold a little something like that against nobody , and I told him so . When I come back from sick call he got up off the bunk and asked how I felt and all like that , and then said , " One thing I do nt like is for my boys to be sick . And if you do nt like KP , I 'll just see about finding another job for you . " I told him it warnt that , though . I said , " It 's just that they88are always having potatoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Yeah , I heard , " he said . " I was talking to the mess sergeantabout it . In fact , he come to me personally about it , so we decided to find you another job . I been thinking about making you latrine orderly . Maybe even permanent latrine orderly , if you like it . " So I said that sounded all right to me , and he said , " Yeah , I think you 'll like it a lot . I sure do , and I 'll tell you one thing  --  it 's something that has to be done right . I wouldnt put nobody in the latrine that I did nt have confidence in . One thing the Colonel always inspects is the latrine . That 's the main thing he thinks about , and that 's why I 'm putting you in charge . " " Well , I 'll sho try to do it , " I said . " I know you will , Stockdale , " he said , smiling and pattingme on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that , I 'll take you down and let you help me wash my car if you want to give it a try . " So we were on real good terms again and I done right good on the latrine . All the others in the barracks had gone to get classified , and I had the barracks pretty much to myself , so I just hung around and kept at it as it got right lonesomenot having anybody around . I cleaned up things so they just shone and then got the bucket and the mop and cleaned the floor , and went over the sinks with paper , so you couldnt have got it much better . The second morning I cleaned it , Sergeant King said he never had seen nobody so good at it . He said I was borned to be in the latrine and he should have knowed it time he saw me . He kept on like that for a good while , and it made me feel pretty good too , so I done a pretty good job on it. 8gAnyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me and Sergeant King got along fine together . All the rest of them were still being classified at the time , and I asked him if I was going to get classified , but he said he doubted it . He said that as far as he was concerned , I had already found my classification , and that fool with it at all . " Yessir , " he said . " Anybody that can clean-a latrine the way you can ought not to do anything else , " and he stood looking it over and his eyes just shone . He did nt look sad at all any more and I felt it was partly my doings too . And one day he took me down to help wash his car , and I kind of appreciated that because that was one thing SergeantKing thought a good bit about . I mean he kept it in this garage off the base , and he kept about three locks on the door , and he had more things to wash it with than you would ever believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and polish and stuff like that , and he showed me all about it , going around patting the fenders , and I do nt guess nobody knowed much more about keeping a car than SergeantKing did . I mean a lot of folks just like to drive a car , but Sergeant King did nt care as much about that , I do nt think , as he did washing it . But he really was good at it and I seen soon after we got there , he did nt really want me to wash none . Everytime I would mention helping him , he would act like he did nt hear me , or say something like , " I guess I had better do this part . You ai nt had much experienceon this kind of paint job . " So I did nt push it none . I finally just set on a bucket and watched him scrub , singing away and whistling to himself . But he was mighty nice about letting me go down there90and I appreciated it . One time he got inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down by just pressing a button , and then he showed me these little shades over the top of the windows that was supposed to keep the rain out . He got inside and run the windows up and said , " See , I can get air up here , even when it 's raining , " and all like that , only it was right hot and his face started turning red after a bit and sweat begun running down the side of it as he set there calling out , " See , I can breathe real good . " But his face kept getting redder so I thought the heat was going to get him and finally said , " Well , why do nt you just get out and rest a while and then you can get back in and show me again later , " but it was late by that time , and we headed back to the barracks . So I did nt really get to wash it none , only I did nt say nothing about it . He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seeing him peaceful again. 12Anyhow , the next day for inspection I cleaned up everything real white , except the tops which warnt supposed to be white , and Sergeant King went pacing all round the place91examining bunks and getting wrinkles out of them and things like that , and telling everybody how to act , and just what the officers would do and everything . He worried a good bit about inspection like that , and he explained it to everybody again , and it happened just like he said it would too . The door opened and some Lieutenants and the Captainand the Colonel come in , and Sergeant King called out " Attention ! " and everybody stood real stiff like they warnt breathing , and the Lieutenants peeped and sniffed around here and there , and the Captain went around looking over the men in their fresh uniforms , but the Colonel , he did nt waste no time at all  --  he only glanced at things and headed right past , coming for the latrine where I was standing at attention by myself , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was the most interested in latrines of any man you ever seen in your life . He was a nice old fellow too , gray-headed with a little mustache and looked like an uncle of mine , but I knowed it warnt as my uncle had nt been drafted that I had heered  --  anyhow , he headed right back for the latrine and went in and looked around , nodding his head and smiling , and seemed mighty pleased with it . And I was myself when I seen the look on his face and seen SergeantKing kind of cutting his eyes around at him . But I did nt want to take all the credit for myself , so when he come back by me on the way out , I said , " Colonel , I hope you like how we fixed up the latrine for you . " And when he turned to me and said , " What ? " I said , " The reason it is so clean was mainly because of Sergeant King there . He 's the one behind it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen a man in his life care more about latrines than you do , and that 's the reason . . . 92 " Attention ! " the Captain yelled out . " You 're at attention there ! " and he come bounding over with his face all red like he was going to jump all over me . But I did nt pay much attention to him because I warnt talking to him nohow , and besides the Colonel held up his hand at the Captain to shut him up , and then he looked at me for a while and asked me to go over what I had said again . So I did , and this time I really laid it on good too . I told him how Sergeant King had told me to clean it up so good because he had never seen a man in his life that would come back and stick his head right down in the bowls the way he done , and I think the Colonel kind of appreciated it too , because he looked around and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I pointed him out , though Sergeant King was right embarrassed and kind of white in the face , and the Colonel went over to speak with him for a minute . I couldnt make out what he said , though , because the Captain begun talking to me , and seemed like he had got kind of interested in the latrine himself . He asked me if I had been doing all the cleaning by myself , and I told him , " Yessir , I been cleaningit for about two weeks now . I 'm the permanent latrine orderly . " " You mean you havent even started classification yet ? You 've been here two weeks and havent even started . . . Oh , Sergeant King , step over here a minute , will you , when the Colonel finishes speaking with you . " So we all kind of gathered around , the Colonel and the Captain and the Lieutenants and Sergeant King and myself , and had a real nice chat about it . They wanted to know about what I had been doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me work there , and how93at first I was on KP for a while , and how nice Sergeant King had been to me , not making me bother with classification but letting me help wash his car and all ; and we kept talking about it , only Sergeant King did nt say much but kept his head ducked down and kept blushing and acting modest and everything  --  anyhow , we talked and talked  --  and finally they got ready to leave , and the Captain said , " King , you come over and wait in the office . I want to talk to you a little while , " and Sergeant King come to attention and said , " Yessir , " so it all seemed to come off all right . And they was about the nicest bunch of officers I had ever seen and must have knowed me from somewhere too because just as they were leaving , the Captain looked at me and said , " You must be Stockdale . " And I said , " Yessir , that 's right , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did nt stay around no longer ; he only turned to the Lieutenant and said , " That one 's Stockdale , " and the Lieutenant looked at me and said , " Oh , yeah , " and I said , " Yessir , that 's right , but I do nt recall meeting . . . " but they were already headed out about that time . Anyhow , you could never tell how Sergeant King would feel about things , as changeable as he was , and when he come back from talking with the Captain , he was most wild-lookingin a way . He stood in his room and kept blinking his eyes and shaking his head like he did nt even know I was there . " You did nt have to do it , " he finally said . " You really did nt have to do that . " " I know it , " I said . " But I did nt seen no sense in me takingall the credit when it was your idea and all . You done a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . . . But he kept shaking his head , and said , " Yes , but did you think that would be helping . . . " and then he stopped and94rubbed his hands over his face and said , " Yes , I guess you would . I 'm not surprised at all . But look here now , you do nt have to help me out no more , see ? I get along all right here . I got four stripes and my own barracks and I do nt really need no help . You 've done enough for me already . Look , you help somebody else out for a while . Look , I know a loudmouthed , low-down , four-striper over in the orderly room , why do nt you help him out a little bit ? Why . . . ? " But then he waved his hand like he did nt want to talk about it no more , and I said I would if I got the chance , but he waved his hand again and turned back around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else now . The main thing now is to get you classified . That 's something we 've got to do . " And then he seemed to get all upset about that too . He got to pacing up and down talking about it , seeming right anxious about it , and looking all worried again . So I tried to calm him down a bit ; I said it probably did nt amount to much and that there really warnt that much to worry about because I liked the latrine fine and had just as soon stay right there as long as I was on the field . But that seemed to upset him too . He said , " No , Will , no ! You wouldnt want to spend the rest of your hitch here , would you ? You want to get out and do something . Nosir , what we want to do is get you classified and shipped out of here , because the Captain said that if you did nt , you would stay right here and . . . Look , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think we ought to get you classified . It 's the only thing . " " Well , I was only thinking about the latrine and helping you out and . . . " But he was the most upset I ever seen him . He said , 95 " Nosir ! Nosir ! Absolutely not ! The Captain said . . . " and then he got all jumbled up with it all . He shouted " Nosir ! " a few more times , and then , " They 'll ship you a thousand miles away from here ! " and a lot of other stuff like that , gettingmore and more upset . And finally he wore himself out and just laid down on the bunk and covered up his face with his arms , upset the way he was . So just as I was leaving , I said , " Well , if they do ship me a thousand miles away from here , I might manage to hitch a ride back every once in a while , " but it did nt do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered up and did nt answer me at all. 13So anyhow , that next day I got started with classification and there really warnt too much to it ifn Sergeant King had nt of been so anxious the way he was . But he kept trying to tell me all the time just how to do and how I should act and all ; he would get me off to the side and tell me how I must try hard because if I did nt , I might just have to stay there in his barracks all the rest of my life , and how he knowed I wouldnt like that and all , and he kept on that way until he made me feel kind of anxious too after a while . But I foundout soon enough there really warnt that much to it . It warnt nothing really but fitting a bunch of pegs in squares and things like that , and sitting in chairs that spin you around and all that kind of thing , so it was easy as pie , and wouldnt have been nothing ifn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But I still done good on it all . I had one little argument with a fellow down at the radio place , and that did nt amount to nothing really  --  it did nt bother nobody but Sergeant King . What happened was , they set us at a table and give us a headset and a piece of paper and this fellow was standing up there talking about how we were supposed to mark down the dots and dits on a paper , but after they got started I couldnt hear no dots and dits at all over mine and told the fellow so . But then he got right unreasonable ; he come bounding over saying , " Do nt you know how to put a headset on ? You got the thing on backward . How do you ever expect to hear anything with it that way ? " And he said , real rough , " Look , put it on right . Do nt you have good sense ? " and some more stuff like that which I did nt appreciate too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next one would be a trial run and in a minute everybody got to writing on their papers , but I did nt because they did nt sound like nothing but dots and dits to me , so I did nt do nothing but just set there , but then he come bounding back over saying , " You 're supposed to mark them down ! Cant you write ? " which made me kind of ornery so I said , " I can write as good as the next man . " " Well , write them down then . " But he had made me kind of mad talking about writing , so I said , " How can I write down things like that ? Those little dots and dits do nt mean nothing to me. " 96 97 " Look , " he said . " It do nt matter what they mean . All you 're supposed to do is mark them in this column if they sound alike , and in that one if they do nt . It do nt matter a bit what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , as far as that goes , it do nt make no difference to me neither , but they still do nt sound like nothing but dots and dits . . . " And he fumed and fussed some more with it , and said , " It do nt make any difference what they sound like to you . I know what they mean and they do nt sound that way to me ; and they do nt sound that way to the fellows that made them up , and they do nt sound that way to the generals  --  so who are you to say they do nt sound like anything but a lot of dots and dits . " And he kept on that way until I got right tired of it . I got up and told him he was probably right and that if him and all the generals said it did nt sound like that to them , then I just wouldnt bother with it and let them listen to it all day long if they wanted to , but then he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did nt like too much . " How 's that ? " I asked him . " You sit down there and put those headsets back on . What do you want to cause trouble for anyhow ? " " I do nt want no trouble . " And he said , " Well , sit down and take the test then . You do just what I said and that 's all there is to it . " " Well , I can write just as good as the next man , " I said . And he said , " Well , go on and do it then , " and did nt say it so rough this time , but more like he was asking , so I set back down and listened to the dots and dits and marked them down like he said . But it was like I told him in the first place , they just sounded like a bunch of dots and dits to98me , so I just marked them all down in the same column and left , because I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did nt have no trouble with it really , only Sergeant King got all upset about it and took it mighty hard . But he agreed the fellow had acted pretty unreasonable ; he said , " As a matter of fact , the most unreasonable thing he did was ever putting the headset on you so you could hear the things . " But then he took on some more how I must try hard and all like that ; he said , " The rest of them wont all be that hard , Will ; and if you do like they tell you , I really think we can swing this thing . You hear what I say now ? Are you listening to me now ? Look , I 've got copies of most of the tests and we can go over them here in the barracks before you ever take them , and that way , you ought to manageall right . But you 've got to try , Will . You got to do just like they tell you . " So I did that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please Sergeant King more or less . We took some more and I done right good on them and Sergeant King was right proud of it too . And one of them I done good on , he said he bet nobody had ever done anything like that as long as the field had been there . That one made him the happiest of all , I think . What it was , was this puzzle made out of steel about as thin as your little finger , and the trick was to put it back together once the Corporal had took it apart , and they was going to time us to see how quick we got it done . The Corporal explained all about it before we started ; he took it apart and put it back together and showed us , and said , " There ai nt but one way of doing it , so you have to use your heads , " and all like that , and then they passed them out to us , one each , and one fellow got a stopwatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Go , " and the other one99mashed the watch , and everybody took to fitting them this way and that . So I got to fitting mine too , but it did nt work out at first , so then I just reached down and got a right good grip on one of the pieces and straightened it out and slipped back insidethe other one and tied them back up together , which was a right good way of doing it because I was the first one finished . So then I got up and give it to the fellow , ready to leave , but he looked kind of funny and turned it over in his hand , and looked at it some more , and said , " What did you do with this thing ? " " I put it back together like you told me , " I said . So he looked it over again and twisted it in his hand , and then he tried to pull it loose , only he couldnt make it as I had tied it up real good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for a minute until I get the Sergeant and see what to do about it . " So he went over to the Sergeant and showed it to him and the Sergeant looked at it and tried to bend it and shook his head and said , " Which one done it ? " And the fellow pointed at me and the Sergeant come over and said , " What did you do to this thing ? " and I told him the same as the other , and then he went at it some more but couldnt get it loose neither . And then they started arguing about it , and the Corporal said , " Well , how would you mark him on that ? " Then the Sergeant looked at him and said , " You 're supposedto be grading this . Cant you do a simple job like that ? " and kept twisting it and pulling at it and getting red in the face . And the other fellow said , " I 'm supposed to mark it down if they put it back together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of doing it , and he sho did nt do it that way . How are you going to mark a thing like that ? " So then they called the Lieutenant over and by that time I was beginning to think I had nt passed it . They all went off in the corner and talked about it some more , and then they got together on a work bench in the corner and got a pair of pliers and a hammer and the Lieutenant held on to it while the Sergeant started whamming away at it , and they mighty near got it loose that way , only he hit the Lieutenant'shand and the Lieutenant jumped up in the air and started cussing and slinging his hand around ; and they took on that way for a while so I finally got tired of waiting and left . And it warnt until I got back and talked to Sergeant King that I found out I had passed it . And I was right glad I had when I seen how he felt about it . It made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back and said , " Yessir , Will , I think we are going to get you classified yet . It just goes to show what the Air Force has come down to . So then we went back to his room and went over some of the other tests I had to take . So I done right good on all of them and did nt have notrouble at all to speak of , only I run into this Major at oneof the tests and nearly had some trouble with him , but Iseen there was something the matter with him and stoppedmyself . But he was a real peculiar fellow and had a way ofsaying rough things at you ; he wore these big thick glassesthat made his eyes look about the size of a cow 's , and whenwe come into this room , he was standing there with his hands folded behind his back , rocking back and forth onhis feet , staring right at me , like he might have knowed meioifrom somewhere . So I looked back at him , and he kept standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him from somewhere , so I nodded and said , " Howdy , " but all he done was just keep staring at me , and never opened his mouth . So I couldnt figger him at first , and we stood around a minute and then he turned and went over to the Corporal at the desk and started talking to him , looking up at me every once in a while , and the Corporal nodded his head , and then the Major turned back around and looked at me again , and then went in this other room . And in a little bit , they led us all in there where we set down at desks that had chairs on both sides of them , the desks lined up and down the wall , and then a bunch of officers come in and set on the other side of the desks , and then I looked up and seen this same Major just taking his chair right across from me . So I nodded and said , " Howdy , " again , but he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his desk , not saying a word , and I waited until he had finished , and then he looked up at me , and started staringagain like he did out in the hall . Then he asked me my name and I told him , and he wrote that down without even looking at the paper , staring at me all the time . And I guess he had the most peculiar eyes I ever seen . I said they was like a cow 's but they warnt ; they was gray and had black specks in them , and he kept them pointed right at me so I looked back at him , and it seemed we done that for a minute or so until he finally said , " Where you from , Stockdale ? " I told him Georgia , and he come back with : " That 's not much of a state , is it ? " which did nt sound very polite to me . But I said , " Well , I do nt live all over the state . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept staring and said , " That 's where they have the tobacco roads and things , isnt it ? " " Maybe so , but not around my section , " I said . " I never seen no tobacco planted in a road . Maybe you from some other part than me . " " No , I never been there , " he said . Then he looked harder and said , " And I do nt think I ever would go there . What do you think about that ? " He let it bust out and kind of leaned over the table at me , and I really did nt know what to make of him for a second . The way he kept making conversation I figgered he was trying to be friendly , but the things he said did nt make much sense , and I never had seen anybody stare like that before . So I did nt know what to make out of him . I said , " Well , I do nt think nothing about it . Fact is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " I do nt think I would ever want to live in your rotten state . How about that ? " " Well , I guess you know where you want to live , " I told him . " Besides that , things is getting right crowded around home anyhow . Some folks moved in not long ago about two miles down the road from us and land ai nt as cheap as it once was . So it really do nt make no difference to me whether you live there or not , not that we wouldnt be mighty glad to have you . . . " I finally quit talking because he did nt seem to be listening nohow . He kept staring and by this time I was staring too . " You mean you do nt mind it when somebody says something bad about Georgia ? " " I ai nt heered nobody say nothing bad about Georgia . " " What do you think I been talking about ? " 102 log " Well , I ai nt thought too much about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " So he went on that way for a while and then all of a suddenhe just quit talking and kept looking at me , and kept looking back , and we done that for a few seconds , just setting there staring , until I could tell it was getting right hard on him . He started to say something and then stopped and looked harder and I looked hard right back , and in a little bit , he got his eyes all squenched up and mine begun to burn a little bit , and we done that a while , but I knowed he had to bat them sooner or later , and after a while his whole face was getting squenched up and then all of a sudden , he just stopped and cleared his throat and looked away altogether . He picked up the papers on the desk and wrote some more on them and then rubbed his hands over his face once or twice . Then he leaned back in his chair and I got ready to start staring again , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started asking me about the most foolishbunch of questions I ever listened to . He asked about all kinds of things I had done when I was a child , and what kind of life I led , and all kinds of stuff like that , and then all of a sudden , he leaned over and said , " Why did you hate your mother ? " which did nt have a thing to do with what he was talking about before . " Sir ? " I said . " Long ago your mother beat you , did nt she ? " " Well , I do nt remember . . . " Did you ever try to remember ? " " I do nt know that I have . " " Do nt you ever try to think of it at all ? " " No , I ai nt , but I will ifn you want me to . I do nt thinkit 'll do much good , though , because she died when I was borned . " And that seemed to make him kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and said , " Well , why did nt you say so in the first place ? " and snatched the paper around and wrote something down on it . So I said , " I guess I should have all right , " and said I just did nt think of it and so on , and then I figgered that maybe he was just leading up to it because he wanted to talk about his own mother , so I tried to give him a prod by saying , " Why ? Did you hate your mother ? " " Certainly not , " he said . " Well , I wouldnt think so . Did she beat you or some-thing ? " " Look here , now , " he said . " You better watch yourself . " So I dropped it right quick . I said I just thought he might want to talk about her for a while , and tried to explain I did nt mean no harm , but he was still right upset about it and leaned over the table saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about my mother , did I ? I was talking about your mother . I did nt say one word about my mother . " " Well , I do nt guess you did , and I 'll sho talk about mine ifn you want me to , but it wont do much good like I said , because she died when I was borned . . . but now I heered Pa say one time . . . " " Well , let 's just skip it , " he said . " I can tell you what Pa said . He used to . . . " " No . No , " he said . " We 'll talk about something else . What about your pa ? Did he ever beat you ? " " Sho . " " Did he beat you hard ? " 104 lo55 " Sho . Lord , I remember one time he took me out behind the pig pen and got one of them fence rails and leaned me over that fence , and Lord , I never got such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember one time . . . " But then he give a bounce and leaned over and stared in my face again and said , " You hated your pa , did nt you ? " and kept his face poked right into mine . And I couldnt think of a thing to say for a little bit . It looked like we was going to have to go through with all that staring again , and it seemed right silly to me , and I did nt want to hurt his feelings or nothing , but I told him then just as plain as I could how I felt . I said , " Sir , I do nt hate my pa and I do nt guess I hated my ma either , and if that 's all you want to know , you can write down there on that air paper that I did nt hate neither one of them , and not my grandpa or my grandma either , because I like all my folks ceptn this one uncle I got that I ai nt too partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , he 's always wanting to rassle with our mule , and I just think he ai nt got very good sense because every time he comes out there he heads back for the barn and keeps the mule all wore out and tired , but there ai nt much harm in him neither that I can see cept him wanting to rassle with that mule , so I do nt really hate . . " All right , " he said . " All right . " " So if you want to write that air down I 'll be on my way and maybe you can find somebody else that hates their folks . . " You just sit down , " he said . " We are nt half through yet . " " Well , now , I 'm through with that much of it . . " You what ! " he said leaning over the table at me ; but then he kind of stopped and set back again and rested a little bit and rubbed his face , and when he looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smiling as nice as he could like he had just seen me and we was old friends . And then he leaned over and said , kind of whispering it , " Will , what do you think about the girls ? " " How 's that ? " " Girls , " he said . " Girls . How do you like ' em ? " " What girls is that , sir ? " " Just girls . Just any girls . " " Well , I do nt like just any girls . I know there is one old girl back home that ai nt got hair no longer than a hound dogs , and she 's the meanest girl I ever did see . One time ... " I do nt mean that , quite . I mean girls in a different sense . When I say girls , I mean . . . " and he hedged around some more , and twisted and turned , and finally got way off the subject , and I never heered such talking as he did then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in Georgia and I 'd start to tell him and he 'd say , " No , I do nt mean that . . . " and then he 'd be off again telling me about girls and what he meant when he said girls , and he got wound up so much it was just like I warnt there . He leaned back and put his head back and squenched up his face and talked and talked , and I listened for a while and glanced around and seen that most of the others had gone already , only he had nt even noticed it . So I settled back and just let him go on and he kept talking about girls , only not about no particulargirl but just about girls in general . So we chatted a good while about girls that way , and then I told him a joke I heered Pa tell one time , about Ike and Mike at the circus , and he was getting a right big kick out of it , leaned way across the table with his mouth open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that next day was the one when I had to go to the pressure chamber , and Sergeant King stopped me on the way out and started telling me all about it again . He said , " You can get to be a gunner anyhow . I know you can . If you can just get through the pressure chamber , you can make it all right . And they cant prove you 've got the bends or the sinus or nothing if you just keep your mouth shut . So you got to be careful , see ? You wouldnt want to not be classified and have to stay here as a latrine orderly all the time , would you ? So you watch it now . " And he kept on like that until all the others outside started yelling to get started , and then he let me go , and we marched down to this theatre where they was going to lecture us about the pressure chamber . And just as I was making myself com- fortable to nod a little bit , I really got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ole Ben 's head sticking up over one of the seats , and there was Lucky next to him , and Irvin and Pete and all the rest of them ! I couldnt even say anything for a minute , but then I yelled out , " Ben ! Ben ! " and he turned around and seen me and said , " It 's Will , yall . It 's Will ! " But about that time this Captain come nodding and smil- ing out on the stage , so I motioned them I would meet them outside . But then he said , " As you were , " which meant to be14109until he finally noticed that the others had gone , and theft he set back right quick and the grin come off his face and he broke in on me and said , " Yes . Yes . Well , I guess I better let you go now . " " Well , I ai nt told you the end of it yet . . . " " No , that 's all . That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and told him how much I enjoyed talking with him , and he said , " Yes . Yes , " and I told him if he wanted to talk about girls some more that he ought to come over to the barracks because the boys over there was always talking about the girls and knowed a lot of good jokes theirselves , and he said , " Yes . Yes . Well , that 's all . Yes . Thank you , " and I told him that maybe if he went out and seen some girls every once in a while he wouldnt worry so much about them , but by that time he was picking up his papers and he got them all together and pushed his chair back and kept saying , " Yes . Yes , " and finally said , " Well , I better go , " and took off down the hall and out the door without even saying good-bye to me . So I got through that part too all right , and Sergeant King was right proud of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and how peculiar he was and all like that , he patted me on the back and said , " Well , he was the main one I was worried about all right . And I think you done right good on it too , Will . The fact that you 're still walking about in the open is proof enough of that for me . I think we might make it after all . " And he seemed right happy about it . There warnt too much else to do , he said , and in a few more days , I would be classified sure enough. io8quiet , which we done , and started to talking and I thought he never would quit . He was a ground officer  --  you could tell because he wore this bashed-in hat and flying officers wear straight hats , and he kept saying Roger and Wilco and things like that , and flying officers just say " Yes " and " No " and he kept talking about airplanes all the time  --  and he was the happiest one to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told how they had planes that could fly thirty thousand feet up and how there warnt much oxygen up there and you would be dead in just a few minutes without your mask , and all about it ; and then he told us about other air- planes that would go up to fifty thousand feet and kill you in just ten seconds , and make the blood boil right up inside your body , and all about that too ; and then started tell- ing us about all the other progress the Air Force is making , and I really got tired of it after a while . But when it was over , I went outside to wait for Ben and them , and I mean it was good to see them all too . Ben and Irvin and Lucky and all of them come out and one of them hit me on the back and then I hit him on the back , and one of them shoved me , and I shoved him , and then one of them grabbed my hat and popped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stomped on his toes , and we had a real nice time of it . Then me and Ben went off to eat together and I seen that he warnt down on the Air Force no more , but was right excited about it , and I felt right good about every- thing . I told him how I was a permanent latrine orderly for a while , and Ben said , " Well , I 'm going to be a gunner , I think . I believe that 's the thing for me , " and when he said that , I couldnt hardly believe it , it sounded so lucky . I had a mouthful of food and couldnt hardly swallow it even . I said , " Me too , Ben . Ai nt that something , though . That 's just what I 'm going to be . " " Well , I be dogged , " he said , grinning all over . " Maybe we can get together . I done passed everything now but the altitudechamber , and we get that this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " And I done passed everything too , and there ai nt going to be a thing to that pressure chamberbecause Sergeant King told me all about it , so I guess we might make it after all . " So we talked a good bit about it , and before it was over , I got about as anxious to be a gunner as Ben was . We ate and sat around for a while , and Ben got to talking about the Air Force and telling me all about it , and he made it sound so exciting and everything that you just couldnt wait to get in  --  and then all of a sudden , you would think , Well , I am in it , and it did nt seem like the same place somehow . We started back and he begun telling me how it was almost as good as the Infantry in a lot of ways . He said , " You just think about it . If a man gets shot in a plane , he 's got thirty thousand feet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might even die because of lack of oxygen , like the Captain was saying . There 's a lot of things that can happen . And you know what they did in the last war , Will ? They give out Air Medals for every five missions . That 's how dangerous it was . And you know what you got after thirty missions , Will ? " " There just ai nt no telling , " I said . " You doggone well right there ai nt . You got the DFC , by gosh . And you deserve it too , Will . Just think of all the things that can happen . So you get a medal just like that , and you fly thirty missions , and what have you got  --  you gotno Illat least four Air Medals and a DFC , and that 's five medals in all , plus another one if you get shot or something , and some others for just being there . How about that ? " " It sounds mighty good , " I said . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as good a chance of getting them in the Air Force as any place . You take my great-grandfather that fought under Stonewall Jackson ; he fought in I do nt know how many battles , and he got shot four times and lost one leg and got his head bashed in , and did nt get but one dinky little old medal , Will . Why , that ai nt beans today . Why , today , you can get a medal by just not doing anything wrong . . . Yessir , Will , if we get to be gunners , there just ai nt no telling how many we can get . So I took on about it a good bit , and we finally got up to the place where they had the pressure chamber , and me and Ben got to go in together . What they done was lead us into this little place that looks something like the front end of a train engine , and they talked to us some more about how we should do ; and then they give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we did nt have no bends or nothing , so then they run us up to twenty thousand feet , and the fellow said over the interphone , " Now you 're going to take off your masks and see how long it takes you to get dizzy . Each man watch the man next to you and when he looks like he has done it long enough , you make him put his mask back on . " So we done that a while too , and did nt have no trouble with that either , only Ben wanted to see if we couldnt keep ourn off longer than anybody else , and he got pretty white in the face before it was over . And I could feel myself gettingright dizzy too and I looked at my fingernails and theywas getting blue-colored , and then I looked back at Ben , and he was setting there grinning sillier and sillier . And then it seemed like I heered him telling me to put my mask back on , and I tried to tell him to put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put put white , " which did nt make no sense at all . But he nodded and said , " Stonewall Air Medal and gun-ner . " I said , " That 's put blue . " And he nodded his head and said , " Sho , " and it seemed like we went on talking like that for the longest sort of time , and the next thing I knowed there was two fellows standing over us and somebody working on Ben 's mask , saying , " Give him a hundred per cent oxygen . He 'll come out of it in a minute . " Anyhow , we did nt have no trouble after that ; they took us up to thirty-five thousand feet and we did nt have no aches , and then we come back down and Ben took off his mask with his hair sticking up every which way and lines on his face where the mask had been , and we got up ready to go . He said , " Well , I guess we done all right , Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're through for good . " But about that time , this fellow stuck his head in and said , " You two fellows come on in here . The Lieutenant will want to see you . Did nt you hear the lecture this morning ? " " Did nt we pass ? " Ben said , his eyes getting wide . " You mighty near passed out , " the fellow said . Then he thought about it , and laughed and said , " Yeah , you mighty near passed out , that 's what you did ! " Then he chuckled a little more over it and told it a couple of more times , but Ben just stood there with his face kind of pale , and did nt smile , so the fellow did nt tell it no more ; he said , " Well112 113come on . I 'll see if the Lieutenant has anything to say to you about it . " So he took us down the hall and told us to sit outside while he went in to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was getting that way myself because it looked like we had failed for sure , but about that time I happened to glance in the office we were setting outside of and seen that the Lieutenant this fellow wanted us to talk to was a nigger , which was the most surprising thing because I had nt seen many niggers since we left home . I turned to Ben and whispered , " Ben , they 's a nigger in there ! " but Ben only looked hard at me , and about that time the fellow come out and said that the Lieutenant would see us now . So we went in , and I mean it was one of the most surprisingthings I ever seen . He was the doggiest nigger I bet there ever was , setting there at that desk in his Lieutenant 's uniform . We come in and Ben he popped to and give him a big salute , but I was looking so hard , I guess I forgot all about it . And then the nigger said right out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what lack of oxygen will do for you at twenty thousand feet ? " and did nt even sound like a nigger the way he talked . I do nt guess I had ever seen anything like it before . But Ben snapped out , " Yessir , it was a mistake , sir , " and he said , " Well , be more careful in the future . You passed it all right . I just wanted to warn you . " And then Ben popped him another big salute and twisted on his heel and started out the door , and then reached back and snatched me by the arm to get me going because I just stood there for a minute . I mean it 's kind of a shock to a man to have a nigger set there and start talking and not even sound like a nigger , so when we got outside I wanted to go back in and talk with114him a little bit as I had nt seen no niggers much lately , and never none like that , so I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to chat with him a bit because he sho seemed nice and was just as friendly as he could be , and there ai nt nobody any friendlier than a friendly nigger ; so I wanted to go back in but Ben kept pulling at me by the arm , and then he lit into me all of a sudden . He said , " What 's the matter with you . Did nt you see he was an officer ? " which was a surprise to me too because I expected Ben would be right happy about having passed and not be mad about anything . I said , " Sho , Ben , and I bet he is a mighty good one too , friendly that way and . . . " But Ben busted in on me again , and lit into me about not standing at attention and not saluting and all , which I had just forgot about . So I tried to explain it to him ; I said , " I did nt mean no offense by it . It was just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . . . " II " Do nt call him a nigger , " Ben said . " He 's an officer ! Did nt you see that ? " " Sho , Ben , I seen that ; but I just did nt think about it , I guess , because he was colored and I had nt seen no colored folks for a while and it made me kind of homesick and . . . But then Ben yelled out , " Quit saying colored . It do nt make any difference about color . He 's an officer , and being an officer , he 's just as white as you and me , and you 're supposedto stand at attention , and you 're supposed to salute ! " He got real upset about it , it looked like ; and I couldnt make it out . His face got red , and when he talked , he waved his hands around and his eyes got big and all like that , and I couldnt figger it for a while . If I had nt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force , I would have115thdught he did nt have good sense or sot ' etlring . He said all kinds of foolish things the more upset he got , but I acted like I did nt notice it . I did nt want to argue or nothing . But when he said that the fellow was just as white as I was when he was in a uniform , it did nt make much sense to me at all , so I said , " He was a nigger really , though , warnt he , Ben ? " " He was an officer ! " Ben yelled . " Yeah , that 's what I mean , Ben . He was a nigger what got to be an officer , " which seemed to straighten the whole thing out . But Ben shouted , " Well , that ai nt what I mean ! What I mean is that when a man 's in uniform , or any other place for that matter , but especially in a uniform , he ai nt black or white or yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man in uniform ! " " You did nt really , Ben . Why , he sho looked to me . . . " " No , " Ben yelled . " Cant you understand anything ? " " You mean you could n't tell he was a different color fromus ? " " No ! " So I puzzled over it a bit but still I couldnt make no sense out of it ; I said , " Dang it , Ben , I ai nt never heered anything to beat it ! Time I seen him , I knowed he was a nigger . " He wouldnt talk about it no more , though ; Ben had his own ideas and he was right firm about them , so I let him have his way . We walked on back down toward the barracks and I got him off on some other subjects , about what all we would do in gunnery and stuff like that , and he told me he warnt worried about the eye test any more , the way he was at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than he thought . Anyhow , he was in a right good humor again when we separated at the PX ; we knowed where eachother lived by then so we could get together again right soon . Anyhow , Sergeant King was real pleased with things when I got back ; he had already heered about my passing the pressure chamber and he went around telling everybody about it and saying as how I wouldnt be there much longer and all like that , and when they tried to dampen him by saying something like , " He still has nt passed the eye test , has he ? " he would just laugh and say , " Why , Will can probablysee right through any chart they got . " Then he would go around humming to himself , and it made me feel right good too , seeing him happy that way . So everybody got to feeling kind of sparky , and when we went out to march down to the mess hall , Sergeant King started to calling off one of the best cadences I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit and marched harder than I ever had . I snatched my knees up and down , and strutted along and rared back like you never seen before , and when Sergeant King called out , " Count cadence , count ! " I hauled off and bellowed so hard the ones in front of me had to kind of duck their heads . I prissed along that way and Sergeant King said , " That 's mighty good , Stockdale , but it ai nt necessary to throw your knees up no higher than your neck , " but I kept on with it ; I was feeling right sparky myself . And we had a right good time at supper too with everybodyjoking and going on . They started kidding me a lot too ; and when this same nigger that me and Ben had talked to come in the mess hall , one of them tried to joke me about that . He had this band on his arm that said OD , which meant that he was Officer of the Day and had to eat in our mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to sit over at the table where the OD usually sits ; and most of them were watching him , but I did nt pay no attention at116 117all . Anyhow , the fellow setting across from me leaned over and said , " Hey , Will , what would a Georgia boy think of a nigger officer ? " trying to joke some more with me . So I come back with : " I wouldnt think nothing of it because I ai nt ever seen one . " " Well , look right over there and you can see one right now , " he said . So I looked around and they was all waiting to see what I would say , but I looked right on past where the OD was setting , and then went back to eating again , shaking my head . Then this fellow said , " Do nt you see that one right over there ? " " No , I do nt , " I said . " Setting over there at the table by hisself , " this fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around at the OD again and kind of strained my eyes and then I shook my head again . " I see the Lieutenantall right , " I said . " But I do nt see no nigger . " " What 's the matter , you blind ? You mean to sit there and say you do nt see that nigger ? " So I looked real hard again like I was trying to make him out , and then I shook my head and said , " Nope , I do nt think so . But course , I do nt usually notice the color of things nohow . " And then I went back to eating , only about that time I heered all these funny things from Sergeant King and looked up at him , and he looked right peculiar . He had a mouth full of food that he looked like he was getting choked on , and his eyes was bulging out and his face red , and he was trying to say something and swallow all at the same time . And finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did nt even sound like his , he said , " Will , you did n't see no nigger ? " 118 " No . " " You see the Lieutenant ? " His voice was mighty funny too , like he couldnt get the words out almost , and his face was so pale , you would think he was sick . " I seen him , " I said . " But I did nt notice no nigger . " " Will . . . ? " " Yeah ? " " Will , do you think it might be that you 're color-blind , or do nt see so good , or something like that ? " " Well , I do nt know about that , " I said . " The only thing I know is what I just got through telling you . What 's the matter , do nt you feel good or something ? " But he never answered me . He just got up and took his tray and his face was the saddest-looking thing I ever seen in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Yes , I guess it 's possible , all right , " and then he just turned away and started walking off real slow , like he did nt feel too good . Then one of them said , " You know , I do nt like him too much , but that 's just going too far . I feel almost sorry for the old fellow . " " Yeah , " I said . " I just hope it ai nt nothing serious . Maybe it 's just something he et . I 'll try to get a tonic or something down him when we get back to the barracks , and then he 'll probably feel a whole lot better . " But they all just stared at me ; I warnt too much worried myself , though . I figgered with a good tonic or something , he would be all right in no time. 11915Anyhow , Sergeant King was all right the next day , but then he had took to worrying about everything again . He said to me , " Will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do nt see too good , but that do nt mean you 're going to have to stay here in my barracks all the time . Now what we 'll do , I 'll talk some fellow from another barracks into putting in an official request for you , and then you can go see the Captainabout moving , and maybe we can work it out that way , if there is a request and everything . " " You got it wrong , " I said . " I see all right . I . . . But he was thinking so hard he did nt half hear ; he said , " Well , just that you do nt see too good then . . . I mean , you ai nt got a chance of passing that eye exam as far as I 'm concerned , but maybe we can get you transferred to some place where you can maybe get ahead and . . . " " I do nt care nothing about getting ahead , " I said . " If I do nt get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here . But I 'm still planning on being a gunner and . . . " But he said , " Oh , no , " right quick . He said , " No , you do nt get the outlook , see ? The thing is , there wouldnt be no room for advancement if you stayed here with me . And you 've got to think of getting ahead , Will . And I mean I 'm going to see that you get in another barracks if it 's the last thing I ever do . " So for the next day or two , Sergeant King went around from barracks to barracks , but things did nt work out the way he had planned it , I guess , because did nt nobody ever make no official request for me , so he got all down in the dumps again . Well , anyhow , all that week some of the boys in the barrackshad been talking to me about going into town one night for a party , saying how they were going to show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me about playing snooker , and how it costs so much to play and all . I had thirty-four dollars , and they asked me about it nearly every day . They would come in and say , " Will , you still got that thirty-four dollars ? " And I 'd say , " Yeah , but that seems a awful lot to pay to play a game . I . . . " " Well , it 's a real expensive game , Will , " they 'd say . " Fact is , it 's a kind of gambling game . But we 'll teach you all right . We sho will , as you say . " Anyhow , I had nt paid too much attention to them ; they were always taking on that way ; but one day I happened to walk into Sergeant King 's room and there was four or five of them in there talking , and Sergeant King looked like he felt a lot better all of a sudden . Just as I walked in , he was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it 's the only thing , like you say . . . " and sounded more like his old self again . And one of them said , " Sure , drunk and AWOL  --  that will mean the guardhouse anyhow , and then . . . " And then they seen me and one of them looked around and said , " Will , have you ever been drunk and AWOL ? " And I said not that I knowed of , and they all hee-hawed , and took on like they do kind of silly , and one of them said , 120 121 " There ai nt no bigger sport , Will . It 's the most fun of any-thing . " Then Sergeant King said to me , " You ready to have that party , Will ? " He was setting over on the bunk and looked like he felt a lot better . " Sho , " I said . " I did nt know you was going , though . " " Going ? Man , I wouldnt miss it for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell back on the bed laughing , and the rest of them joined in because everybody was feeling real merry , so I joined in a little bit myself . It was mighty good to see him all full of spark again . " Yessir , " Sergeant King said , setting up . " We 're really going to have us a party . You ever drink , Will ? " " Well , just the stuff Pa used to make but I never . . . " We will , " he said . " I 'll see that everybody gets a pass , and I 'll take my car . Yessir , I 'll take my car and we 'll go down the road and see the sights . How about that now ? " " Sounds good , " one of them said . " Sounds goodern good , " Sergeant King said . " How about it , Will ? You want to ? We 'll show you the town , in it and under it . Yessir . " " You still got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do nt worry about money , " Sergeant King said , getting up and walking around kind of excited . " By God , this is one time I 'll supply the money myself . " " Well , we just thought we 'd shoot a little snooker on the way , and that 's a right expensive game , you know , " this other fellow said . " And anyhow , there ai nt no sense in you trying to hog everything . " Then they all laughed and took on and banged me on the122back , and Sergeant King looked real happy about it . It was the first time he had looked peppy in about three days . Well , they spent most of the day talking about it , everybody getting ready and telling me what all we was going to do ; and how not to worry about nothing , that they would take care of me , and all like that . They said , " And do nt worry about the Air Police neither if they say anything to you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth down their throat and that 's all there is to it . Sergeant King can get you out of it if you get in any trouble . " Sergeant King hung around too , going to the windows and looking out at one or two little clouds that floated by and getting worried again because he did nt like to drive his car on muddy streets , but finally it cleared off and toward late evening there warnt a cloud nowhere , and he got to looking real happy again . And about dark , we got the passes that Sergeant King had arranged for and went down to the garage and got the car out . Me and a fellow by the name of Polettie and another one called P.J. who warnt as big as Ben and wore glasses too  --  we set in the back seat , and Sergeant King and another fellow by the name of Chris set in the front seat , and then we rode the five blocks into town at about ten miles an hour . It warnt too much of a ride because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat because Sergeant King did nt like you to slouch back on the covers , and we had to hold our feet right still in one place so as not to stir up the dust in the bottom  --  but anyhow we drove the five blocks into town and about six blocks on the other side of it to park because there warnt so many cars out there and Sergeant King kept being worried about some drunk driver hitting it ; and then we got out and started walking back to town . It really123did n't seem much worth it to me , but it made Sergeant King right happy having drove it , and it got enough dirt on it so he would have to wash it a lot more next week , so you couldnt gripe after all . Anyhow , we walked back toward town with everybody getting real jolly and punching at each other and laughing and taking on . Sergeant King said , " We gon na rip and snort , ai nt we , Will ? We gon na rip and snort . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog , we is . " " Well , youse guys can rip and snort , " Polettie said . " Myself , I want some whisky . " " We gon na have whisky too , " Sergeant King said . " We gon na rip and snort some whisky too , ai nt we , Will ? " " That 's rightern the preacher with the devil , " I said . " That 's rightern rain on a tin roof , " Sergeant King said . " Yessir , this here is a nice little town and it 's got all the things a man could want , and the AP 's are the finest bunch of fellows you ever seen . You can get drunk and rip and snort and kick the windows out and beat folks on the head with chairs , and they never say a word . You do nt have a thing to worry about . This is your party , your farewell party . .. " " Well , that 's mighty decent . . . " It 's nothing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy . We 'll see that you get back all right . " " And if we do nt , the AP 's will , " Polettie said . Sergeant King laughed and said , " Yessir , Will , you just let yourself go and have a good time . " So they laughed and joked and took on that way all down the street , and it was right merry being amongst them . Then Polettie stopped and said , " Right over yonder , " and led the way over to where he said we could play some snooker . It warnt nothing but a pool hall , though , which kind of sur-124prised me ; and snooker warnt nothing but just another way of shooting pool . But they was all excited and I did n't say nothing about it ; they got down their cues and powdered them and chalked them up , everybody talking and jabbering , and then Polettie come over to show me how to shoot . He said , " You see those little pockets , Will ? Well , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump it against the ball here  --  we calls this the cue ball  --  and knock in one of them red balls in one of these holes here  --  we call them pockets . Then you get to shoot one of the other balls , see . A red ball counts a point and the other balls count whatever it says on the side . Then you shoot the rest of them in rotation , that means two , three , four and so on . See ? Nothing to it , really . The only other thing is that it is usually kind of customary to put down a little bet . Now how much was it you said you had ? " " Thirty-four dollars , " I said . " Well , we 'll just get everybody together and see how much of that we can cover . We 'll let you cover all the bets at first because this is your first game , okay ? " So he went around and collected up twenty-seven dollars and they covered that much of my thirty-four . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to break the balls because I was doing most of the betting , so I leaned over and broke them up and made me a red ball , and they took on about that for a good while . They clomped me on the back and said I was about the best they was and so on , and acted like real good sports about it , I thought . They said , " Okay , Will , you done made one point now . Now you get to shoot a numbered ball , any one you want . . . " So I picked out the seven ball and sunk it , which gave me eight points , and they took on some more about it , only not125as much as the first time . So then I shot again and dropped another red ball , and then the seven again , and then another red one , and then the six , and went on like that for quite a while until all the red balls were gone . And then I started shooting them in rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in it , I guess , because it warnt until I was down to the last ball that I noticed that nobody had said anything for a while . So I looked around and seen they was sitting around just watching , not saying a word , some of them on tables and some of them in chairs around the place . Anyhow , I stopped then , feeling right bad about hogging all the shooting ; I said , " Do nt one of yall want to shoot that one ? It do nt seem right for just one person to do all the shooting all the time . " But none of them moved or said anything . Then Polettie put his cue back in the rack and said , " Naw , Will , you might as well go ahead and shoot that one too . We wouldnt want to keep you from learning how . " " That 's all right , " I said . " There really do nt seem to be too much to it nohow . Do nt yall want to rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There ai nt one of us that could afford the necessary dime , " and they all started putting their cues back up , and it made me feel pretty bad . If I had of knowed they had bet all they had , I never would have bet with them in the first place . We went out of the place and I was right miserable thinking about it . I wished they was some way I could give it back without making them feel bad , but I couldnt think of no way at all . It ai nt ever right to act like a man ai nt willing to pay off his bets , and I know I wouldnt want to lose money to a man and have him try to give it back to me  --  you wouldnt even feel like a man no more. 126But we wandered around for a while and everything got more dismal , so I decided to take a chance on it . I come out and said , " Well , now , I do nt want yall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to lend you a dollar apiece if you need it for the night , if you just want to borrow some , being as we are going to have a party and everything . " They all stopped and looked at me , and I was scared I had said the wrong thing , only I did nt see no harm in lending them some ; but then Sergeant King said , " That 's mighty decent of you , Stockdale . Mighty decent , " and took it pretty good . They all gathered around and I give them a dollar apiece ; and then I told them , " I 'll lend you another one later on ifn you happen to need it . " But Polettie said , " Another dollar ? Why , I do nt see how on earth we are going to spend all this one , Will , " so I did nt bring it up no more , as I had gone pretty far in the first place . Anyhow , we went down to this place they were talking about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like much of a party . The place got pretty crowded up with so many people that you couldnt move around hardly , with all kinds of different uniforms around , sailors and soldiers and so on , and there was so much smoke that the ceiling looked blue with it , and a big old juke organ blaring out so loud that you couldnt hardly talk to each other . We set in the booth and drank some more beer that I ordered , but nobody had much to say , only set there looking at the other people , and the thing got right dull for a party . We saw one right good fight , and we thought we was going to see another one because these two fellows started yelling pretty hard at each other ; one of them kept saying , " Let me go . Let me go , " to this little old fellow who warnt half holding him nohow , and kept127trying to jerk away from him to get at the other one , and the other one kept doing the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them go , but then they just got right close up to each other and poked their faces out and mumbledthings at each other , and cussed a little bit ; but by that time warnt nobody paying any attention to them and they quit , and the last I seen of them they was up at the bar drinkingtogether . I tried to liven it up some by telling them a joke but they just set there and fiddled with their glasses and looked at the beer , and sipped at it , and when I got through , did nt nobody even smile about it . Polettie and Sergeant King kept nagging at each other ; Sergeant King said he wished he had nt even of come , and Polettie said , " Well , this was your bright idea , not mine , " and then Sergeant King mumbled something else , and nobody seemed like they was having any fun at all . And it warnt until I mentioned that I might get some whisky that anybody took any notice at all . But Sergeant King said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea . Why do nt you do that ? " " Yeah , " Chris said . " That way things might work out pretty good after all , " and looked around smiling at everybody . So I went out and got a couple of bottles and when I got back , they was talking hard and excited , and seemed a lot more lively already . We opened the bottles and Sergeant King said he would pour it and poured me a glass about full , and said , " Here you go , Will . You 're the first . Drink all you can hold . We 'll watch out for you , and if there 's any trouble , you do nt have a thing to worry about . " So I drunk it and they all watched , and then I poured ix8them each one too , and we got to drinking and everybody got to having a lot more fun . I ordered some more beer and we drunk that along with the other . Everybody got real lively and most polite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , saying , " Drink up , Will . This is your farewell party , and I do mean farewell . " It did nt seem fair for me to drink most of the whisky that way , but they seemed to enjoy doing it , so I did nt say nothing about it . We got to talking about different kinds of drinks and little P.J. said something about how he liked wine , so I went out and got a couple of bottles of that and another bottle of whisky , and when I got back everybody got to having a big time . Sergeant King fixed a special drink for me ; he poured some wine and whisky and beer all in a glass , and it did nt taste so good , but they kept saying , " How was it ? How do you feel ? " so I said , " It 's mighty good , " and then they started to fix me another one , and I drank that one too . So we set and drank for quite a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only this time he couldnt hit the glass and poured stuff all over the table ; and then Chris took it and tried putting the glass on top of the bottle and then turning the bottle upside down , and then little P.J. tried it , and before it was over , they had spilled most of the bottle . So then Sergeant King said , " Cant yall think of nothing else for our guest to drink ? " and we got to having a chat about drinking in general , and it was real interesting . Polettie tried to tell about some drink he knowed about , but you couldnt make much sense out of it because , even though he was talking right hard , there warnt no sound coming out ; so I told them about a drink that this uncle of mine used to fix up with gin and whisky and beer and how129he always liked a little bit of kerosene in it for flavor , and they thought that sounded mighty good . So I went out and got a bucket and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up together with the gin and everything , and they seemed to like it right well . They said my uncle sho knew how to fix a drink all right , and I told them that warnt nothing to some of them I 've seen him fix , and after a while things got real sociable . And then some fellow from the Infantry come in and one of them got to talking with Chris and pulled a chair up and drank a little with us . He said he was stationed somewhere around there and that the place he was stationed was about the worse place in the United States . Then Chris said it warnt no worse than the place where we was , he would bet , and the the other fellow heehawed , and said that where the Air Force was stationed , it warnt rough at all , and they talked a while about it . Chris said , " Walter Winchell called it the dirtiest filthiest place in the United States , " and the other fellow said that warnt nothing , that Walter Winchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over and said , " Yeah , but yall do nt have to pull all the details we do . " Then the Infantry fellow said , " Details ? Do nt make me laugh . That field there is just like heaven compared to where we are stationed . " And that seemed like a mighty nice thing to say , so I said , " Well , we sho appreciate you saying so . " And he said , " Yall do nt have it rough at all . You have it mighty easy and just do nt know it . " So I thanked him again because it looked like he was going out of his way to say nice things , but then Chris cut in saying , " What do you mean , we do nt have it rough ? " " You got it easy . You got it easier than the Navy . " " That 's mighty nice of you to say so , " I said . " Look , you do nt know what rough is , " Chris said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " The fellow heehawed and said , " We got it rougher than any base in the country . They drill us fifteen miles a day . " " They drill us twenty , " Chris said . " You do nt know what hard drilling is . You boys in the Air Force have got it made . In the Infantry , we never get it easy . " And then Chris said , " Well , look , if you think so much of the Infantry , why do nt you just shove on off and quit drinkingour whisky , " which kind of surprised me , as it warnt the right thing to say at all . But then the fellow reached over and got the bottle and hit Chris in the head with it , which surprised me too because he had been talking so nice just a few minutes before . So I stood up and tried to tell him he shouldnt do that but then he tried to hit me with the bottle too so I had to pop him one . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Sergeant King standing up on the table with his hair all messed up and his eyes wild-looking , waving a bottle around and shouting like he had gone crazy or something . And then he give another yelp and went sailing through the air like he was flying and caught one fellow around the neck and they went over a table together , and then the whole place was fighting . I bopped one or two more , and set back down , and about that time little P.J. climbed up on the table looking wild too and tried to give130 131a bellow himself , only it come out kind of weak , and then he went sailing through the air at something or other but missed it and hit right on his stomach . And then I seen somebodypick him up and he went sailing back across the other way . I lit a cigarette and smoked it and watched Sergeant King running up and down the bar yelping at the top of his voice , and then I spotted Chris over rassling with some fellow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Polettie  --  he was setting there still thinking he was talking but withoutno sound coming out . Little P.J. went sailing past again ; he hit and bounced and skidded , and then this one big fellowgrabbed him on one arm and another grabbed him on the other arm , and they started arguing about who could knock him the furthiest . One of them said , " I 'll bet you a dollar I can knock him further with my left hand than you can with your right , " and the other fellow said , " It 's a bet . Put up or shut up , " and they started digging for their money , and then little P.J. started digging for his money too . He pulled out his dollar bill and waved it around and said , " I 'll just take a dollar of that myself , put up or shut up ! " and the fellow looked at him and said , " Look , boy , you 're just throwingyour money away  --  I 'm left-handed , " but little P.J. yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the way I see them . Put up or shut up ! " So they argued and took on for a while and I seen that the party was about over with everybody bopping everybody , so the next time little P.J. come sailing by I reached out and grabbed him , and then pulled Polettie out of the booth and took them outside ; then went back in and found Chris under one of the tables and got him by the collar and pulled him out ; and then had to go back in to get Sergeant King who was tied up around a table and couldnt get loose . Anyhow , 132I finally got them all out and prodded them down the street , holding little P.J. by the collar because he kept kicking at everybody along the way , until we finally got to the car . But then little P.J. got down off my shoulder where I was having to tote him by that time , and decided to attack the car , and begun kicking at the fenders and making all kinds of noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowed how Sergeant King felt about his car . But it did nt seem to bother him  --  in fact , it seemed to make him right happy because he said now they would have to wash it again . I tried to talk them out of that , but they was all for it then , and went to piling in the car , and finally the only thing to do was just to get in with them and keep them down as best I could . But they was the wildest bunch I ever seen by that time . We went driving through the town with them falling allover the place and making all sorts of rackets , and thenSergeant King drove off the road and went wobbling acrossthe field with the car bucking this way and that , and comeout on the beach and drove down there a while , from oneside to the other . And about that time somebody said thatwas the best place they knew to wash a car , and SergeantKing said he thought so too , and so he headed it right outfor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt think I 'd dothat ; you know what you said about salt water on a car andall . . . " but he never paid any attention ; we hit the watergoing right fast so it splashed out in big sheets and slowedus down some , but then he got the car in second and drovealong a bit that way , saying , " Listen to that power , boy . Listen to that power , " and kept going that way until thewater was about four feet deep . Then the car just sputteredand stopped there , and they opened the doors with water133pouring in from every side , and then they piled out yelling at each other , and then they took off their shirts and begun to wash . And in a little while , they seemed just as happy as they could be with Sergeant King whistling and singing and all the others joining in on it . Little P.J. was setting on the top and he was singing too , only every once in a while , he would get mad and start trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . And they kept it up that way for I do nt know how long until I got right tired of it and climbed in the back seat to get some rest , only I couldnt get comfortable there with it so wet and soggy ; so I got out again and tried to talk them into going back , but they still wouldnt do it . They whooped and hollered and kept on washing and made quite a racket out of it ; and in a little while this car come down the beach shining a spotlight this way and that , only he never thought to shine it out in the water , I guess , and little P.J. wanted to attack it too , so we had to hold him a while . But that did nt stop them neither ; as soon as it had passed , they went right back to work again , singing and whistling to themselves . So after a while I got right tired of it and said , " Ai nt yall about ready to go now ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that latrine all fixed up , and yall got to get your stuff up too because the Colonel . . . " But Sergeant King said , " Will , you go on off and leave us alone . You ai nt doing anything but spoiling everybody 's fun . " " But you said that salt water warnt much good for your car nohow and . . . " " There ai nt nothing better for it , " Sergeant King said . " Good for the paint . " " Get off your shirt and wash , " Chris said. 134 " Yeah , " Sergeant King said . " If you do nt want to help , go on back . " " I do nt mind helping . It 's just that we got to get back for inspection and I was going to fix up the latrine special this time because it might be my last time and . . . " You do that , " Sergeant King said . " You go on back and fix up the latrine . We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So there warnt any way of talking them out of it . I stood around a bit longer , and took off my shirt and washed for a while too , but I finally got tired of it . And then I tried to talk them into coming on again , but they wouldnt do it , so I finally just left them there . I slipped back across the beach after the car had passed with its spotlight going up and down , hearing them singing and splashing around even three blocks from the place , setting up the worst racket you ever heered in your life. 16So I headed on back to the barracks and started work on the latrine right away . What I done , I took this long piece of wire I had and run it from seat to seat , because they are all135in a line , you know , and then I pulled it around to the back of each one so you couldnt see the wire , and then I run it over to the door so I could get a grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tacks under the lid , so it took me quite a while to do it . I guess it was nearly two o'clock when I finished , and Sergeant King and them still warnt in . I figgeredthey would make it sooner or later though because Sergeant King warnt going to miss an inspection if he could help it , so I went on to bed . And I went to sleep in just a few minutes after that because that 's what mixing a lot of drinks usually does to me . Makes me go to sleep in no time after I get in bed . I did nt sleep long , though . I was up again before day and Sergeant King and them still had nt showed up , and I begun to get a little worried about them . But I had the latrine to clean up , so I went ahead and got the mops and rags and soap and a bucket , and really got it to shining too . I never seen it look so nice . I was through with it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door because I did nt want them in there messing it up none . At first some of them wanted to use it anyhow , but I told them how I had cleaned it up and all ; but some of them kept on about it , but after I explained to them what I would do if any of them went in there , they acted real nice about it and went over and used the one next door , all of them but this one fellow who did nt act so decent about it . He come up and kept jabbering about taking medicine of some kind , and I said , " Well , go over next door and take it if you want to , " but he stood there saying , " I already took it , I took it last night . Look , I got to get in there . I mean it ! " I tried to explain to him but he got to talking louder and louder about the place next door being all full , and then he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not making much sense at all , so I finally had to shove him away a little bit . And he even kept on it a while after that , but I did nt pay no attention to him , so finally he just started crying and left . Anyhow , I begun to get right anxious about Sergeant King and them because I did nt want him to miss how I had fixed up things this time . We went to breakfast and come back and they still warnt there . I went ahead and straightened up their beds for them and made everything square , which was a good bit of work being as I had to keep my eye on the latrine all the time , and when they had nt showed up after that , I got kind of anxious about it . And then some fellow looked out the window and said he seen the Colonel and the other officers next door , and said , " It wont be long now . They 'll be here next . It 's just too bad about King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of hoping he would make it , " I said . " The way I got everything fixed up for him . " And I no sooner said it than this fellow called out , " Here they come ! Here they come ! " And I looked around ready to come to attention , but then I seen it warnt the officers he meant  --  it was Sergeant King and Polettie and P.J. and Chris , just coming in through the door . They come dragging in , water still spurting out of their shoes every step they took , their clothes still wet and their hair hanging down in their eyes . Sergeant King had one sleeve torn off his shirt and one of his eyes black , and the rest of them looked about the same  --  I guess about the worst-looking bunch I ever seen in my life . They stopped in the middle of the barracks , water dripping in little puddles on the floor , looking around at all the bunks and things and then Sergeant King looked up all of a sudden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai nt . . . " 137But about that time , the door opened and somebody called out , " Attention ! " and the Colonel and the Captain and the Lieutenants come walking in . Sergeant King 's head kind of snatched back and his eyes kind of popped , but then he snatched himself up to attention and stood there like the others done ; and then the officers stopped right still too . They stood there right quiet , looking at Sergeant King and them , and for a few minutes it was so quiet that all you could hear was little drops of water dripping off their clothes and pattering on the floor . Anyhow , I was standing there in the door with the wire around my foot and they come walking on back to where Sergeant King and them were standing , and I could see they was right disappointed in everything . Sergeant King and them stood real stiff , looking like tramps ; and the Colonel first walked up to Sergeant King and looked him over , up and down while Sergeant King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be breathing , and the Colonel 's face looked all droopy and everything . Then he looked up and down Chris and P.J. and Polettie , and then he went back to Sergeant King and started all over again . Then the other officers done the same , and then the Colonel looked at the Captain and the Captain looked at the Lieutenants , and none of them even said a word . And I was right glad then I had gone to all the trouble of fixing up that latrine , too . I figgered at least that warnt going to disappoint them . And it did nt , neither . You ought to have seen their faces when I give that wire a snatch ! The Colonel finally come walking on back , just like I knowed he would , everything still right quiet , and then he come poking his face in the door , and about that time I yelled out , " Ten-shun ! " just as loud as I could ! He warnt standing but about two feet off atthe time and I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lieutenants because it was such a surprise for him  --  anyhow , I yelled out that way and he jumped back and then I jerked up real straight and snatched my foot with the wire tied to it , and those seats popped up in the air just as nice as they could ! They really banged too  --  they slammed up against the side of the wall so loud it sounded like the place was coming down . So it really worked good that way , and finally the Colonel poked his head back in the door again because he had gone all the way outside when they started popping he was so surprised  --  he finally peeped back around at me and looked back in again , and me and those seats were standing just as straight as you could want , all of them right at attention ! He just stared at them for a while . Then he looked at me for a minute , and he couldnt say a word he was so surprised . He stood there blinking his eyes for the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and nodded at me and said , " Yes , I remember you . I certainly do . " " Yessir , " I said . " Sergeant King made me permanent latrine man . " " Oh , yes . Sergeant King did that . . . " " Yessir , " I said , and then I looked at Sergeant King and done the same thing I had done before . I knowed Sergeant King had asked me not to do him no more favors but the Colonel was right disappointed in him this time , so I told a flat lie . I said , " We thought you would like it . Me and him fixed it up for you . " I looked at Sergeant King out of the corner of my eye and you should have seen his face . It was the whitest I ever seen . He was right embarrassed about it . " He showed me how , " I said . And then the Colonel looked at him and said , " Sergeant138 139King ought to tell us some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better come over to the Orderly Room again and explain a few more things to us ! " He stood there looking Sergeant King up and down and then he shouted out , " Right now , Sergeant . Right this minute ! And do nt bother to get dressed up . I want to talk to you just the way you are  --  I ' 11 enjoy what I 'm going to do a lot more , " and then he turned and headed out the door . Sergeant King followed them out and for a few minutes did nt nobody move . They all come and looked at the latrine and stared at it like they had nt never seen nothing like it before . And then Chris come over and stood there and looked at me with his eyes kind of blank , and started to say something ; he opened his mouth but nothing come out , and then he kind of stumbled over and flopped down on his bed . I said , " I was getting worried yall warnt going to make it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just turned away , all of them but little P.J. who still had nt come out of it , I guess . He hauled off and tried to kick at me but his foot got tangled up in the wire which tripped him up so that he hit flat on his back , which made the seats fly up and bang against the wall again , which kind of scared Chris because he come bounding up in the bed , looking wild-eyed this way and that , and then flopped back down again . So I picked little P.J. up and put him to bed ; he was out like a light already . Anyhow , I waited around for Sergeant King to get back and find out what happened with the Colonel , but they kept him over there for the longest sort of time . Some fellows who had passed by the Orderly Room came in and told everybody they still had him in there and that they had heered part of it . " He 's explaining how he was at the picture show and somesailors got to cussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk like that , they jumped on him and beat him all night long . The only thing is , he cant remember what show he was supposed to be at . " " He told them Forward March American Battalion ! " the other fellow said . " Yeah , but when they asked him who was in it , he said Willie Hoppe , and he warnt in it at all . " " He 's sticking to it , though , " the other one said . " He said Willie Hoppe was dressed up like a Chinese . " " They warnt even Chinese . They were Japs in that picture . " " That 's what the Colonel claims . " Anyhow , I finally begun worrying over what was keeping him so long and went over to the Orderly Room to find out . You couldnt hear nothing , though ; the doors was closed and they had quieted down some . But all the clerks were setting around and while I was standing there , the First Sergeant come up to me and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're going to gunnery school all right . I think you ought to tell Sergeant King about it when he gets out . I think it 'll do him good . " " Well , I be dogged , " I said . " I 'm mighty glad to hear it . " " You ai nt the only one , " the First Sergeant said ; then he looked at the door to the office where they had Sergeant King and said , " I ai nt ever liked him too much , but anyhow you tell him when he gets back , will you ? There 's just so much a man can take , and I think it might help a little bit . " So I went back over to the barracks and waited until SergeantKing finally come back . We went up to his room and he was laying on the bunk with his hands over his eyes , holding his stripes in his other hand , and he did nt move when140 141we come in . He said , " Stockdale , I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got some good news , " I said . " Guess what . " " No , " he said . " I do nt want to guess . I 'll tell you what I 'll do though . I 'll stay right here and keep my eyes closed for thirty seconds , and anything else you can do to me , just go ahead . All I ask is that it is quick and silent . " " I just wanted to tell you I 'm going to gunnery school . I just heered . " He took his hand away and looked at me a second , but then covered his face up again . " No , " he said . " No , you 're going to stay here forever and ever and ever . . . . " The First Sergeant just told me , " I said . " That 's right , " another fellow said . " I heered it too . " Sergeant King took his hand back off his face and looked around again . Then he set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean he really is , and last night , all of it was for nothing ? He was going anyhow ? " " It 's a fact , " the fellow said . Sergeant King looked at me and shook his head ; then he kind of smiled and shook his head some more and took a deep breath and said , " Well , no man can expect everything . I lost my stripes , but I can take it , I guess . I guess I can take it . " He stood up then and started walking up and down , kind of talking to himself . " You just have to put up with certain things , " he said . " There 's no getting around it . " Then he turned around to the others and said , " You think I 'm bitter ? Well , I 'm not . Old King has a lot of juice in him yet . You think I 'm going to let four little stripes ruin my life ? Nosir , not old King ! Nosir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he turned to me and said , " So you 're going to gunnery school . You 're going to ship out far , far away and never come142back no more and I wont ever see you no more ... you think I cant take it ? With that , I can take anything ! " " I 'll try to make it back every once in a while , " I said . " Yessir , with that I can take anything , " he said . " Even my car . . . even . . . And then somebody yelled out , " Yeah , there it comes ! " from the inside of the barracks and Sergeant King stopped and they yelled , " It 's outside , King ! They just brought it in ! " He looked outside the door . " They just brought what in ? " " Your car , " they said . " They got it out there now . Look at that thing , will you ? Hey , yall , look at that thing ! " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to the windows to get a look at it . It did nt look so good , neither . The seats was turned upside down and the back one was poking out through the rear window and all the other windows was broke , and it had weeds all over it and big dent in it , and it was the most peculiar-looking color I ever saw . It was hung on the back of a wrecker , parked in the front of the Orderly Room , and there was some AP 's going inside . Sergeant King looked at it ; then turned away from the window real quick and lit a cigarette and begun walking up and down , puffing , and rubbing his hands over his face . Then one fellow said , " You could tell them you was going to a drive-in movie and you seen some boat lights and thought that was the movie , and you just happened to . . . " but about that time , the First Sergeant stuck his head in the door again and motioned with his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and started out again . Well , it warnt until I got back from dinner that I found out what had happened . I stopped by his room on the way143back to get my bags packed , and he was setting on the side of the bunk looking out the window . Some others was standingaround but they quit when I come in , and turned and looked at me . I said , " Well , I guess I 'll start getting packed now . I guess I 'll see you around before I go so I can say goodbye , wont I ? " And then this fellow next to me said , " No use in that . He 's going to gunnery school himself . He 'll be right with you . " Well , it was the most surprising thing ! I looked at SergeantKing and he just kept setting there staring out the window , and I couldnt get over it for a little bit . Me and Ben and Sergeant King would all be together . " It just goes to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , but what some good do nt come out of it one way or the other , " and Sergeant King , he agreed , I think . But he still did nt say nothing , just set there staring out the window for the longest sort of time. 17Anyhow , we went to gunnery , and me and Ben both got to be privates-first-class which means you wear a stripe on your arm , only we did nt get to wear it long because of this144Captain that was in charge of our crew in transition . He was pilot of the plane and was always real particular , wanting you to wear neckties and such most of the time , which I did nt care nothing about . Anyhow , he stopped me and Ben up town one day and I did nt have my tie on , and we had a few words about that when I tried to explain to him how it was , which I found out later I warnt supposed to do  --  Ben said all I was supposed to do was stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like a kind of foolish way to talk to a man  --  so one thing led to another and we was recruits again ; and besides that he changed us off his crew and put us in another crew . And Ben did nt like that too much because he said we was now on the sorriest crew on the base . He said everybody knowed it was the worst crew there , but I did nt much think so myself because I got along with them pretty good . They was real easygoing compared to the other one ; it did nt make much difference with them whether you showed up for a mission or not . Lieutenant Bridges was the pilot and he was a Reserve and was the only one of the officers I knowed much at first because the planes was so monstrously big and because we flew in the back and they flew in the front so that we did nt see much of the others , and did nt know them usually when we did . But Lieutenant Bridges was a mighty easygoing fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went around most of the time with his eyes about half-opened and half-closed , just kind of dragging himself around like he was walking in his sleep , only he just seemed that way , I think ; he warnt really asleep but probably only half drunk , even though it was kind of hard to tell the difference most of the time . And as far as I was concerned , I had ruther been on his crew than the first one because he was so easy to work for . If you took it in your145head you did nt want to go on a mission , he never would noticeyou warnt there nohow . I mean like this one fellow we had ; he did nt fly hardly any and one day when he come out to the plane , Lieutenant Bridges did nt remember him and wouldnt let him fly with us until he went back to Operationsand got a card showing he was supposed to be on our crew . Anyhow , Sergeant King had got back to being a sergeant again by that time and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and Ben hung around a good bit , not doing much but going on practice missions , and Ben finally quit worrying about losing his stripe , and we had a right nice time . Ben still did nt like the crew much  --  he was mighty disappointed in them most of the time and said it was a good thing most of the officers warnt like them and all like that , but he liked flying a lot , so we went on most of the missions , not skipping them the way about half the crew did . And I did nt mind it much myself  --  it warnt much trouble because there warnt nothing to do in the back of the plane but sleep or play cards or set there and watch the country go under you . Finally I got a checkerboard and took that along , and me and Ben and this other fellow took turns playing each other , only the other fellow did nt play much because he was working on a model airplane that he took along with him . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becausehe finally just quit coming altogether , and I guess he must have dropped off the crew because we did nt see him around nowhere for a long time . Anyhow , there warnt much to it ; when we was scheduled for a mission , me and Ben went and crawled in the back of the plane , and when it landed , we crawled back out , and never had anything to say to anybody except sometimes146when Lieutenant Bridges would call back to see if anybody else was around , and I was kind of enjoying it . And then one day I happened to meet the co-pilot up in Operations , which was a right peculiar thing because we was just standing there talking together and his voice sounded familiar and he said mine did too , and finally we found out we was on the same crew together . His name was Lieutenant Gardellaand he seemed like a real nice fellow , and when I asked him what they done up in the front of the plane , he said , " Nothing much . What do yall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the checkers and the cards that we played sometimes and he said that sounded mighty good to him and that he would come back and play with us sometimes , and I told him I would like to have him and that I wanted him to meet Ben besides . I asked him what his job was and he said , " Oh , I do different things . Mainly , I just let the wheels up and down and I stick to that pretty rrruch as I do nt care to take on anything more right now . " " How long you been letting them up and down ? " " A pretty good while , " he said . " About six weeks now , ever since I got out of cadets . Next time we fly I 'm going to let the flaps up and down too . Say , why do nt you come up front and fly with us next time ? Why do nt you ask Bridges about it ? " " Well , that 's mighty nice of you . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " " Sure , " he said . " I 'll show you all about it . " He was a real obliging kind of fellow that way and you wouldnt think he was an officer at all just to look at him  --  he looked like he was only about thirteen years old and you would probably think he was a Boy Scout instead of an officer if you seen him , only he always had this big cigar in147his mouth and usually did nt seem real sober neither , which of course ai nt like most Boy Scouts as they usually seem right sober most of the time . So I went out and finally found Lieutenant Bridges in the BOQ and he was laying down on his bunk and I had to stand around a while before I could tell whether he was asleep or awake with his eyes half open the way they always was , but finally he set up and looked at me , and I told him what I wanted . And he said , " Look here , you cant just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask your own pilot ? " And I told him he was my pilot , and so he looked at me for a while and finally said , " Oh , yeah , I thought I had seen you around somewhere before . What did you say your name was now ? " So we talked for a while and he said I could ride up front with them on the next trip , and then I asked about Ben , and he said , " Ben who ? " and I explained to him that Ben was another one of his gunners , and he said it was all right by him , that it did nt make no difference to him one way or the other . But when I went back and told Ben about it , Ben said , " No , I 'll stay in the back where I 'm supposed to stay . I never seen officers care as little about things as this bunch does . I wish we had never got off the other crew myself . " So I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " No , there ai nt any use in that . After all , the pilot is in charge of the plane and what he says goes , I guess , even if he do nt seem to know what he is talking about half the time . " But they warnt all that bad , I did nt think , and I really enjoyed watching them work when I flew up front . We took off that day about dark and Lieutenant Bridges got the plane off the ground real good and Lieutenant Gardella letthe wheels up and done a right good job of it too , right smack up in the sides like he had been horned doing it ; we went skimming out over the end of the runway and then Lieutenant Gardella got out a cigar and stuck it in his mouth and rared back and begun reading a magazine , while Lieutenant Bridges flew back over the field and then set it on the automatic , and then propped his feet up and leaned his seat back to go to sleep . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I went back to talk with Lieutenant Kendall , the engineer , only he said he was sleepy and was getting his parachute under his head and sticking his feet out in the aisle trying to get comfortable . So I finally went back and set in the radio operator 's seat , because he had nt showed up , and watched Lieutenant Cover while he navigated ; and he was the one I wished Ben could have seen because he was probably the hardest-working man I ever seen in my life . He was bounding all over the back of the plane navigating even before it was over the end of the runway , peeping down tubes and looking out the window and writing things down on maps that he had scattered all over the desk , then grabbing up one of them three watches that he had scattered around and checking the time , and writing that down , and then taking this camera-looking thing he had , and running back to the dome and pointing it out at the stars that was just coming out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrote so fast and so hard that twice the lead flew off the pencil and flipped across the plane and nearly hit me in the eye ; and another time he snatched up a map that had this weight on it that sailed across the desk and caught me right beside the head ; so I got up and moved down a ways after that as it did seem right dangerous being close to him working that hard but I148 149still watched him a good while and got a kick out of it . Anyhow , I wished Ben could have seen it the way he went at things ; he was so busy most of the time he wouldnt even talk to me . Most people that work hard usually like to talk about it a good bit , but when I asked him where he was navigating to , he snapped real quick , " Biloxi , Mississippi . Do nt bother me , I 'm busy , " and wouldnt even look at me . After a little bit , we was well on the way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets at night , with only the sounds of the engines and no lights to speak of except little blue dials and the lamp that come down over LieutenantCover 's head ; but watching him work was enough to wear you out , so I got a little bit sleepy , and must have dozed off for a good while because when I woke up there was a big disturbance going on with people walking around and talking , and I did nt know what was going on . Anyhow , I woke up and felt the plane going in these big circles , and then I looked over to the desk and there was Lieutenant Bridges standing holding one of the maps in his hand and looking at it , and Lieutenant Cover arguing with him , rattling papers around and trying to show him how he had figured this and that . Lieutenant Kendall was setting over there watching them with his chin propped up on his hands , and Lieutenant Gardella was up front flying the plane in these big circles , looking around every once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cigar stuck out of his mouth ; they was talking loud and everybody seemed real interested in it , and it seemed like Lieutenant Bridges knowed a lot about navigation himself even though he was the pilot . He was waving the map around saying , " I do nt care what your figures show . I guess I can look out the window and see , cant I ? " 150 " Well , you just check the figures for yourself , " Lieutenant Cover said . " I got a fix about thirty minutes ago and that showed us right here , and thirty minutes later , we 're supposedto be right here . You can check every figure down there . I figured that position by Dead Reckoning and I figured it thirty minutes from that fix , and I know it 's right ! " But Lieutenant Bridges kept on shaking his head and saying , " Well , by God , I can see , cant I ? I can look right out the window and see , cant I ? " So they talked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of interest in it , it seemed like . Lieutenant Kendall was setting back there listening to the whole thing and he was right interested too , even though he was the engineer , and so I stepped back there and asked him what the discussion was all about . And he said , " What do you think it 's about ? They 're lost again naturally . I been in this plane seven times and five of them we been lost . All I know is how much gas we got and if they want to know that , I 'll be glad to tell them , but I ai nt going to worry about it any more . They can ditch the plane or jump out for all I care ; the only thing I know is about how much gas we got . " Then Lieutenant Gardella called back and asked how much gas did we have , and Lieutenant Kendall said , " Tell him we can fly another forty minutes . I do nt want to talk with him because every time we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm tired of talking about it . " " I know what you mean , " I said . " I do nt like to argue about things neither , but it is good to see everybody taking such an interest in things ; old Ben would be surprised to see it . " " Who is Ben ? " 151 " He 's one of the gunners , " I said . " He rides in the back of the plane . " " Well , " Lieutenant Kendall said . " I hope he knows how to use a parachute . " " Sho , " I said . " I bet Ben knows about as much about parachutesas anybody you ever seen . " Anyhow we chatted a while and then I went back and listened to Lieutenant Bridges and Lieutenant Cover some more . Lieutenant Cover was still talking about his DR positionwhere he said we ought to be ; he turned to Lieutenant Bridges and said , " Well , who 's been navigating , you or me ? I got a fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is right here , about a hundred miles out over the Gulf of Mexico . . . " And then Lieutenant Bridges come in with his side of the argument , saying , " Well , I might not have been navigatingbut I got eyes in my head , and I guess I can look out the window right now and see we 're circling over a town half the size of New York ; and according to this map or none I ever saw in my life , there ai nt a town at all in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico , much less one half the size of New York and . . . " " Well , just look then , " Lieutenant Cover said . " Do nt argue with me , just look . You can check every figure I got here . My DR position puts us ... " " Well , I do nt care anything about that , " Lieutenant Bridges said . " All I want to know is what town we 're circlingover , and if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant fly here all night long while you try to tell me there is a town of that size in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico ! " So they took on that way for a while , and then LieutenantGardella and Lieutenant Kendall had a pretty good argumentabout one of the engines going out ; so they discussed that a good while too until Lieutenant Kendall said , " Well , there 's not any sense in arguing about it ; I 'm going to feather the thing . " And after a little bit , they changed positions , and Lieutenant Bridges come up front and looked out and seen that one of the engines warnt working , and went back to see Lieutenant Kendall and they had a long talk over the engine being feathered too . Lieutenant Bridges said , " You are not supposed to go around feathering engines like that . I 'm the one that 's supposed to feather the engine . I 'm the pilot , ai nt I ? " " Yeah , but you was too busy trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there flying it and . . . " " All right , " Lieutenant Bridges said , " but at least you could have told me we had lost an engine . I am the pilot , ai nt I ? " So they talked about that a good while too , and I set back and watched and listened , only I must have dozed off again because when I woke up , we was coming in for a landing . We hit and bounced once pretty hard so that I got throwed halfway across the plane , and then bounced again so that it throwed me back where I started from , but then I grabbed on and did nt get throwed no more on the rest of the bounces . We taxied up the runway with the wheels squeaking and finally stopped and started getting out , but nobody was talking much by then except Lieutenant Gardella  --  hekept telling Lieutenant Bridges that he thought the third bounce was the smoothest of all , but Lieutenant Bridges did nt seem to care about talking about it none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others did either . Anyhow , we got out and they had this truck waiting forus and we got on that , and nobody was discussing nothing by this time , and I was right sorry for that because I wanted Ben to hear them because they was right interesting to listen to . But everybody just set there and then Lieutenant Cover come out with all his maps and everything folded up , and he got in and did nt say a word to nobody either . The truck finally started up and we headed across the ramp with everybody real quiet until finally Lieutenant Bridges leaned over and tapped Lieutenant Cover on the shoulder and said , " Look , Cover , I do nt mean to run this thing into the ground , but I would appreciate it if you would try to find out where this place is . I mean if it is in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico , we 've damn well discovered something . " And then Lieutenant Cover said , " Well , the way you fly , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So we drove up and got off and everybody stood around for a while hemming and hawing , and Lieutenant Bridges went over and asked Lieutenant Cover again if he had figuredout where we was , and Lieutenant Cover said , " I thought you was the one who knew so much about it . If you want to find out , why do nt you ask the driver ? " But then Lieutenant Bridges said , " Ask the driver ? You expect me to land a plane and then go over and ask a truck driver where I landed it ? " and got right stubborn about it . But then he turned to me and said , " Hey , what was your name now ? " " Stockdale , " I said . " Look , Stockdale , " he said . " How about scouting around here somewhere and see if you cant find out what place this is , will you ? Be kind of casual about it , you know . " So I went down the way and asked a fellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and told Lieutenant154Bridges and he seemed to feel much better about things then . " Well , Houston ai nt such a bad town after all , " he said . " By gosh , Cover , you 're getting better every day . You did nt miss the field but about four hundred and fifty miles this time . " Then Lieutenant Cover said , " Well , what I figgered was that you would bounce the rest of the way  --  it looked like it from the way we landed .. . " And then Lieutenant Bridges had something to say to that , and after a while they begun squabbling a little bit , which I did nt like to hear . Me and Ben stood around waiting while they went at it and Ben said to me , " I never heered a bunch of officers argue so much in my lifel " " Yeah , Ben , they do now , but you ought to have been in the front of that plane and seen the way they worked . That was something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a lot more of them . Why , I 'll bet they are about as good a crew as you can find , when they 're sober like that . " " Which ai nt often , " Ben said . Anyhow , I hated for Ben to hear the squabbling and kept on talking to him until they had finished up with it because he got so disgusted about things like that . But they was finally finished ; all of them heading across the ramp except Lieutenant Cover who had lost the argument because they had all jumped on him together before it was over  --  he was getting all his charts and stuff up and mumbling to himself . And I felt right sorry for him the way he had lost out on the argument and everything ; I went over to him and said , " Well , I wouldnt worry about it none . I do nt see how it amounts to too much . I had just as soon land at this field as155 any other one , and we ai nt going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right down on things and turned around and looked at me like he was almost mad with me , and said , " Look , do you want to check my figures ? Do you want to check them and see for yourself ? I got them all right here ! " " Well , I do nt know nothing about it , " I said . " If you say they 're right , I guess they is . " " I can show you my DR position , " he said . " It shows us right out in the Gulf . " " Well , I wouldnt know about that , " I said . " If you say your DR position is out in the Gulf , I reckon that 's where it is all right . How long do you expect it to be out there ? " But he was pretty much down on things ; he turned away and stomped off without even answering me  --  nothing you could say would make him feel any better . 18 But after supper , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ben went over to see Lieutenant Bridges and them and they were all setting around the room and had a couple of bottles on the table and were getting along fine ' 56157together . When we come in , Lieutenant Bridges was saying that he did nt care if he was in Houston , he thought LieutenantCover was a good navigator , and Lieutenant Cover said he did nt care if Lieutenant Bridges did almost bounce the plane off the runway every time he landed it , that he were right satisfied with somebody that just knew how to get the thing on the ground . They kept passing the bottle around and then they noticed me and Ben there and offered us some but Ben did nt drink and I did nt care for none either ; so we stood around until they started to squabbling some more again , and then me and Ben left and went in town to a picture show . Ben was right disgusted with them all again because he said that warnt no way for officers to act , and I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Drinking and arguing and taking on like that . Officers do nt do that . Besides , if they do have to act like that , they ought not to do it around us because we are enlisted men . I do nt know what makes that bunch do that way . They do nt act like officers at all . " Anyhow , after the show we went back by their room again to find out what time they were taking off the next day , only we did nt find out much because they was still at it . They was arguing pretty hot this time and had finished up a couple of bottles that lay on the table and had opened up another one , and I do nt reckon they even knowed me and Ben was there . Lieutenant Bridges was talking to LieutenantKendall about the engine going out and wanting to know why . He said , " You 're the engineer , ai nt you ? You 're supposed to know those things . " " Was I flying the plane ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That do nt matter , Ken . You 're supposed to fix it . " " I never wanted to be a flight engineer nohow , " LieutenantKendall said . " What I wanted to do was run an Officer'sClub . " So then Lieutenant Cover wanted to drink to all the men that run the Officer 's Club , but Lieutenant Gardella wouldnt because he said they all wore mustaches and that he knowed one that had a mustache two inches long ; but then Lieutenant Cover said he knowed one that did nt have a mustache and so Lieutenant Gardella said he would drink to that one all right . " Did you ever see the one at Baker Field ? " Lieutenant Cover said . " That man had the biggest ears of any man I ever seen . You remember him ? He couldnt get them under the earphones . He would have to tuck them in . He was a Major . " " Let 's drink to him too . " " I remember one time , " Lieutenant Cover said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all of his ear under them , and he worked and worked . . . " Well , let 's drink to him too , " Lieutenant Gardella said . " You all the time talking . Do nt you ever want to drink to anybody ? Why do nt we stop all this talking about people and do some drinking to them ? " So they all begun arguing some more , so me and Ben never found out a thing , and finally just left there and went back to our place and figgered we would get out there early in the morning and meet them there . Well , we got there about seven o'clock and set around about two hours before any of them showed up , and once I looked at them , I kind of wished they had nt showed up at all . Lieutenant Bridges ' hair was sticking straight up on his head and what you could see of his eyes was all red , and he had his parachute on backwardso that it hung down in front of his stomach and158mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waddlingalong that way , giggling silly about something that Lieutenant Cover had said , and we went up to speak to them and none of them even knowed us at first . Then the others come along and they looked just about the same as Lieutenant Bridges ; they had been up all night long and they acted the silliest of any bunch of grown men I ever saw in my life . Ben wouldnt even look at them he was so disgusted . There was a truck there waiting for us , and when we got up , Lieutenant Bridges stood up on the back of it and held his nose like a kid ready to jump in swimming and hollered , " Here 's the way I 'm going to bail out ! " and went jumping way up in the air and falling on his back hard enough to break it , it seemed like ; and then Lieutenant Cover stood up and he had his suit on backward too , and he yelled out , " Well , here 's the way I 'm going to bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air too and hit flat on his back on the cement too ; and they laid there with their backs nearly broke , kicking their feet around in the air and laughingtheir silly heads off . It looked like we never would get started , and from the looks of them I did nt much care if we did nt . I looked at Ben and his face was all white and his eyes popping out , so I guess he felt the same as me . The driver of the truck had his head poked out the window looking at them because he couldnt start with them laying all over the runway , and there did nt seem to be no way to get them all on at the same time . I mean Ben did nt like it too much neither . They warnt the best crew on earth sober , and drunk , I do nt guess they 's ever been another one like them . I looked at LieutenantGardella , though , and thought it might work out all right because he was the only one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few . Then you do n't have to pay any attention to them . " She stood up and moved to the dressing table and began brushing her short , black hair . " I wish you 'd told me , " she said , still in the same subdued voice . " Told you what ? " " That you did n't want me to have the party . " He stood up too . " You know perfectly well , " he said , " that that kind of party bores me stiff . But that 's not any reason for you not to have ' em . My God . . . " He stopped speaking , his attention arrested by a small sound . He could see her eyes in the mirror . They had been fixed on his face but now she was looking away as if she had just heard somebody else call to her . The sound he had heard was the brush being laid down on the dresser , slowly and carefully , and as noiselessly as possible . She was leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if in an effort to hear better . But there had been no sound in the room except his own voice and the minute sound of the brush striking against the glass top of the dressing table . What other voice was she listening to ? What could it be tellingher ? He felt his lips stiffly framing a smile . " Hell , darling ! You do n't have to give up all your pleasures just because I hate my fellow men . " As he spoke he took a few steps toward the door . He had not reached it before she came to him , so swiftly that the white robe she was wearing was slipping from her shoulders as she put her arms about his neck and pressed her body against his . " You do n't ! " she whispered . " Do n't what ? " he asked , automatically tightening his arms about her . " Hate your fellow men . " " No , " he said wearily , " but I get damn tired of ' em . " Again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his before she tightened her arms about his neck . " Is anything the matter ? " she whispered.  |p101He  was silent a moment then he said : " I 'm not able to work . But that 's been going on for a long time . " The tenseness left her body . She pressed herself closer against him . " I mean really the matter , " she said , still in a whisper . He laughed . " That 's enough to make me hard to live with . " She threw her head back so that her face was turned up to his . Her eyes looked into his mournfully . " I wish I could help you . " He laughed again . " You ca n't . Nobody can . " " But I want you to be happy ! " " I 'm not of a happy temperament , like you , " he said , and bent and set his lips hard against hers . But she still clung to him , pressing her face now against his shoulder . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could be ! " " All right , I will be ! " he said , and caught her to him in one more swift embrace before he hurried from the room . Molly and Ed Archer had come back for dinner . Cynthia sat on Claiborne 's right ; Max was across the table from her . There was a vacant place beside Vera . Robin Vincent , who would occupy it , had not yet arrived . The mulatto butler , Gershon , stepped quietly about the table , proffering broiled chickens on a bed of wild rice , tomates provencales , the last lettuce from the garden , and poured Chablis into crystal glasses . Claiborne , as soon as they settled at Blencker 's Brook , had imported an old playmate from Tennessee to fill the post of butler . Molly Archer had predicted that they would have trouble with him . A friend of hers , a woman farmer , had had to get rid of her Viennesep102butler . Two years on the farm had made him feel that his calling was unmanly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duties in the house . Claiborne had assured her they need have no worry on that score : Gershon had no desire to get out " to the field " ; he had been born and bred a house servant . " My own third cousin , damn it ! " he had exclaimedin a moment of irritation . As for getting along with the women servants , lie had maintained that he had never seen the woman , black or white , that Gershon could n't get along with . Claiborne looked at his wife . She had put on a fresh white dress , but she had not put on any make-up and she had not taken time to brush her hair . She said that that was the advantage of having it naturally curly . But she was forever washing it , often under a tap in the stable lot . " Oh , my God , " she would say , " I must wash my hair this minute , " and off she would go and hold her head under that tap till all the lather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking herselflike a dog coming out of water , start in helping Rodney do something he could do better by himself , lazy and inefficientas he was . They were talking about Catherine Pollard . " I like her , " Vera said . " She thought Bud was wonderful . But you know , I do n't think I 'd have recognized her . She is n't a bit the way she used to be . " " The torso 's not the same , " Max said , " but she 's still got that look in the eye . " " What kind of look has she got in her eye , Max ? " Vera asked . " Oh , a bit pazza , but awfully beanina . She 's just as full of beans as she ever was . . . . You know , I may give her my Vision of St. Eustace . ' She remembered it from the old days . You know , she really likes that picture ! " " I always go to San Eustachio 's church when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got antlers on top of it . . . . Why do you suppose I 'm so crazy about deer ? " " Marcell get you off by yourself some time and tell youp103all about that , " Max said . " Vera , what did you think of the Lathrop boy 's gourds ? " " I thought they were simply divine , Max . All those fruits and flowers . " " I got the idea from Marcia 's collection , " Max said modestly . " Garlands that the Pambas  --  I mean the Upper Pambas  --  tattoo on their enemy skulls in the long tropic evenings . " Cynthia laughed a little and said , " Pambas . . . She would have liked to join in the conversation  --  you could tell that by the taut yet eager way in which she held her body , the smile she kept on her face . But how could she ? She did n't speak the language . It was a " little " language that they had been building up , now in one country , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , half Italian , or English words with French endings , or mispronunciations that time had endeared to them  --  people were never gauche but gauche ; some friend of Max 's had made that slip years ago and it had gone into the language . George Crenfew 's colloquialismswere embedded in it too , and his wife 's psychological jargon . A favorite sport was to " talk Marcian " with Marcia herself . Max never tired of that . He said it helped the vector of his reality stress to adjust . He had an odd , self-flagellating sense of humor . This summer he had discovered a new diversion : planting in his conversation from time to time references to the supposed homosexuality of some great man . Confucius , Isaac Newton , Thomas Babington Macaulay , Commodore Perry , Marco Polo  --  every man who had ever lived was grist for that mill , provided he was famous enough . Up to date Max regarded John Donne as his greatest triumph . As a result of his allusions , Marcia had read all of Donne 's sonnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . He said that he expected to get her started on the sermons before snow fell . Cynthia was asking if the Pambas were head-hunters . " Only the heads of their hereditary enemies , " Max said . " A Mugwumboo may paddle his canoe right past their huts . But let a Dunaboo show his head ! "  | " Do they always tattoo the heads after they have taken them ? " " They will try to tattoo any portion of the body , though there are some spots that so far have baffled them . Nipples ... He emitted the word " nipples " with a little clucking sound . In a few minutes he would be describing the difficultiesthe Pambas confronted when they attempted to tattoo genital organs ; Max could not talk five minutes without makingsome reference to sex . Had he always been like that ? He could not remember , but he did remember distinctlythe first time he had ever seen Max Shull : slim , not more than twenty years old , walking past the Cafe Select in a dark cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him in a modest , almost maidenly gesture . Horne Watts had walked beside him . Horne 's hand had lain heavilyon Max 's shoulder , his round , lowering , rubicund face bent over Max . He had been talking earnestly . What about ? Claiborne wondered . Horne 's gestures had been those of one trying to persuade ; Max 's bearing that of one who might be won . But Max was already won . He and Horne were living together in that studio on Deux Anges when he himself came on the scene . In those days Max had taken himself seriously as a painter . A Cubist when he first knew him , later on he became a Vorticist , fond of quoting Ezra Pound 's dictum to the effect that the directions which forces take in time and space " are more important than light falling on a haystack . " I wonder if they are , Claiborne thought wearily . If he had not started up from his cafe table and hurried over to greet Horne , whom he recognized from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting here now , talking about the Pambas . Or would he ? Max and Vera would probably have got togethersomehow . They had liked each other from the start and now it was hard to imagine one without the other . If they were separated from each other as much as two daysp105they rushed together like children to tell what had happened . He had not even known that Bud was ready to stand until Max mentioned it one day . " But darling , I never dreamed you 'd be interested ! " Vera said . I would n't , either , he thought . I would n't give a damn if he 'd never been born , much less stood . . . . Was it because he was the kind of man he was that his wife had to have a fellow like Max around ? Once , at a party , he had come near knocking down a fellow who had referred to Max as the " Claiborne clown " and had been prevented only by realizing , drunk as he was , what a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it he , not Max , who was the " Claiborne clown " ? Max had been living in a squalid flat on Barrow Street for two months that year that everybody , even die-hard expatriateslike Polly and Barry Craig , came back from France ( Polly 's new husband and Barry 's new wife , and Polly 's and Barry 's children and Barry 's children by his first wife , and even a small baby that Polly had contrived to have by her new husband , all on the same plane ) . He had driven out with the Claibornes to look at this place . Max had an eye for places . For ten or fifteen minutes he paced about the house without saying a word , then stopped in the square front hall to say succinctly : " This is it , children . You 're fools if you do n't snap it up . " They had gone through the front door into the garden : grown wild but it was still a sight to behold that first spring , the grass all littered white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom everywhere . They had followed the path to the little brick house at the end of the garden . Both doors were off their hinges and most of the window lights were broken , but the walls were in line , the beautiful , rose-colored handmade brick crumblingin only a few places . There was a big square room , a floor of oak planks at least a foot wide , and two smaller rooms behind that . He had known what Vera was going to say while her hand was still describing the rectangle in the air . " You could have a north light there . "  |p106He  had hardly dared to look at Max 's face . The poor fellowhad stood there  --  not as plump as he was now , but alreadythickening about the middle so that he no longer cut the figure he once cut in evening dress . He had stood there , his hands hanging at his sides and , slowly , as if the very air might turn hostile if disturbed by too sudden a movement , had raised his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Yes , " she said . " It would make a fine studio , would n't it , Tom ? " and she had given him that look that she gave him so often in those days , that she still sometimes gave him . Max had given him a look too . There was no pleading in it . It was more the look that a bird , disturbed on its nest , or an animal come upon suddenly in its lair , might give you . The fellow had a kind of manliness : you had to hand it to him . He had kept his face impassive and yet he must have been taking into account all the objections to his occupying the little house which at that moment were running through Claiborne 's head . He had taken them into account and refused to minimize them by word or look . There was only his glance , that intent watchfulness of the bird or beast waiting to know whether you would deal it life or death . He had heard himself saying heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Max . Better grab it before somebody else gets it . " Max had replied that the prospect was , indeed , attractive , and that he would think it over . Claiborne had realized then that Max was not going to take advantage of Vera 's innocence . He was going to give him , Claiborne , time to warn her . He would have to be convinced that both of them really wanted him there before he would take over the house . The next day Claiborne had told Vera that he thought it might , after all , be inadvisable to have Max living in the little house in the garden . " There 's a side to his life that you do n't know much about . " " Oh , but I do , " she said . " I 've always known . " Then shep107laughed . " I do n't , though , really . I 've always wondered what they do . " " Damn it ! " he said finally . " The fellow goes to parties  --  ' drags ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Poor thing ! " she said . " He 's too fat to wear white satin . " A few days later she told him that she had had a long " frank " talk with Max and that Max had given her his word of honor that if he became the occupant of the little house in the garden he would never have any " drags " there . " And he says he does n't wear evening gowns any more , " she added . He could only stare at her . " You win ! " he said . Well , she had won  --  on the whole . When Max came to live in the cottage he apparently severed connections with his " gay " friends , or , if he continued to see them , saw them only in town . It was true that he was sometimes absent for days , even weeks , at a time . But as far as Claiborne knew with any certainty , he had " slipped " only once since he had come to live at Blencker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come after Max had been absent for several days . Claiborne , suspecting that he was in trouble , had hurried to the address given him by the unidentified voice and had found Max in a cheap hotel off Times Square , considerablybruised and shaken as the aftermath of an evening given over to his old pursuits . He had insisted on staying on at the Hotel Hibiscus till his injuries had had time to heal , and he was very desirous that Vera should not know of his " slip . " Claiborne had promised that she should never know it from him and had kept his word . Robin Vincent had now come in and sat down beside Vera . Cynthia was trying to talk to him across the table . Robin smiled politely and went on eating chicken . Claiborne caught Gershon 's eye and beckoned to him to refill his glass . It seemed important that he should have more wine quickly . He knew now how Robin had looked when he parachuted to the earth . His hands would have been moving , slipping the silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drawnp108up under him , and the face out of which his eyes stared straight ahead would have been so expressionless that it might have served for a burial mask . Like those mummies they bury with their knees drawn up under them , Claiborne thought , only he 's still up and walking around , and he leaned a little farther forward , staring . Robin evidently felt himself observed . He looked up , eyed Claiborne , then , without any change of expression , looked down at his plate . Claiborne glanced at his wife . Her face was deeply flushed , her eyes moist and mutinous . Ed Archer , sitting beside her , stopped talking and looked about the table , a little smile tugging at the corners of his lips , before he turned back to Vera . Claiborne listened and distinguished phrases . Ed had stopped by the Hesses ' on his way over here and had found both brother and sister excited over another new " process " which the inseminator had revealed to them . Hogs this time . A method by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were born and brought up on cow 's milk . " But if you do that the pigs wo n't get any colostrum , " Vera said . " They get colostrum in mother 's milk . Every newborncreature has to have it . " " Joe 's thinking that maybe we 've been overemphasizing the virtues of mother 's milk , " Ed said . " Oh , no ! " Vera said earnestly . " And you say they breed the sows immediately after farrowing . That ca n't be good for a sow , Ed . " " Oh , it makes an old lady out of a sow in no time , " Ed said . " It 's wicked ! " Vera cried . " I 'm going to talk to Joe . " " You 'll find Joe a hard nut to crack , " Ed said . " Joe 's all forscience . Joe 's the farmer of the future , all right . " I would n't mind his kidding her , Claiborne thought , if she did n't fall for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born yesterday . He said aloud : " Joe Hess is n't a farmer . He 's an alchemist . " Ed looked up at this . He always wants to know what I think . Makes him nervous if he does n't know what I think about something . " An al/chemist , " he said in the same loud voice . " Hell , he makes no bones about it ! What 's that hex sign he 's got on his barn but an alchemical symbol ? Prima materia , in the form of a globe , weighed down by the crescent moon . Joe 's in league with the Powers of Darkness . His farm is n't a farm . It 's a chemical retort . " " Minta 's the one I feel sorry for , " Molly said . " She does just as much work in the dairy as he does , and the housework too . And they could afford help . " " She 's his soror mystica , " Claiborne said . " He could n't bear to turn loose all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night  --  she was back home the next day . " " It 's a fact , " Max said , his eyes sparkling . " She stayed with Elmer Carfax just one night . I 've often heard Joe say she was home in time to milk the next morning . Joe says he sometimeswonders what Elmer done to her . " Ed laughed . " What sort of mixture is Joe trying to shake up in his retort , Tom ? " " The same thing the achemist is always after , " Claiborne said . " Something for nothing . Joe 's bad enough , but he 's got a pal that 's an even bigger rascal . My Pen Pal , ' Joe calls him . Lives out west . Up in our attic at Eupedon there were a lot of old letters from Thomas Jefferson . He and my greatuncleJeems used to write back and forth about a fertilizer foimula Uncle Jeems worked on all his life . They were for putting fertility back into the soil . Uncle Jeems drove all over Tennessee and Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em with sulphuric acid . But these bastardsare set to rob the very earth ! Joe 's Pen Pal has been planting corn in the same field for five years and getting forty bushels to the acre . He claims he can keep on doing it if he only turns under enough each year . " " And ca n't he ? " Ed asked . " No , he ca n't . " " How do you know , Tom ? " " It 's one of those things I was born knowing , " Claibornep110said , " and if you were n't born knowing it you 'll never know it . " " Eupedon science , " Ed said . " Straight from the Eupedon lab . " " That 's right , " Claiborne said . Some of these days I 'm going to take Ed Archer out and beat the living daylights out of him . I could do it . I 'm bigger than he is  --  even if he does keep in better condition . " Suppose you did , " the Voice said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of socking him , that 's what . " " Where would you sock him ? " " In the kidney . Or the groin . " " You 're that kind of fighter ? " " Sure . Every man is . " " And after you 'd socked him ? " " I 'd put him on his back , and I 'd say , Take that , Ed Archer , you . . . ' " " Hit him when he was down ? After punching him in the groin ? " " Sure , and if he put that look on his face and opened his mouth . . . " " You 'd hit him again ? But you could n't spend the rest ofyour life hitting him . What would he say when you stopped ? " " He 'd say I punched him because he was kidding my wife . " " Is that the reason ? " " It 's one of the reasons . I 'd punch him because he 's Ed Archer , that 's why . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I do . " The Voice fell silent . he could silence it sometimes , with a remark like that . He looked about the table cautiously . They were all madder than he  --  he had no doubt of that  --  but it was hardly likely that they heard as many voices , or rather , that they heard one voice so often . It was always one voice . I would n't mind it so much if there were more than one voice , he thought  --  or would I ? Vera was looking at himp111meaningfully . There was something she wanted him to do . He turned to the girl beside him . " Vera tells me you 've made more translations from Ausonius ? " Her eyelids fluttered and went shut . Her head jerked a little to one side , while the muscles of her mouth drew slightly downward . She said , " Yes , the one everybody tries . . . the one about the roses . " " I tried the nineteenth epistle once , " he said . A brightness came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " He shook his head . " I do n't know where it is , " but even as he spoke he had the feeling of entering a familiar , a secret place which he had not visited in a long time . . . . A house full of dark wood , a spring wind blowing in through the tall windows . . . . Old Pauncefort always held his seminars in his study in the spring term . He would still be in his dressing gown when you got there , but his beard would shine like silver . He gave you a glass of port while he drank his coffee . That day he had a heap of translations before him when his eye glanced down and fixed the paper that lay beside the heap . He put the paper he held in his hand down and picked mine up and read it through slowly twice before he read it to the class . I ca n't even recite the Latin now and all of my translations have gone out of my head , except lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine Boeotian Muse , Call the bard back with Latin song . .. . " Felicitous , Gentlemen , I think we may say that this is truly felicitous . . . . " When you are young you think you have a lot coming to you . To be middle aged is to look back and realize that a moment like that  --  when some old codger puts his head on one side and seems to see you for the first time  --  is one of the best you 'll get . Old Pauncefort had a fellowshipfixed up for me at the American School in Athens , but the war ruined that and then Uncle Robert died and I came into that bit of money and went to Paris instead . . . .  |p112His  wife was calling to him . " You do n't think so , either , do you , Tom ? " But he could not answer her for the spate of words that was suddenly in the air . If you listened closely enough you could hear Max 's voice , follow what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were stealingthe show from Bud when they sent that heifer of Marengo 's out here , but they had n't taken into consideration the fact that Marengo was , after all , dead . There was a limit to the number of heifers he could sire , whereas Bud was just starting . Vera should not be discouraged . The Laird and Laird people had merely opened up vistas of future triumphs for Bud . Claiborne fixed his eyes on Max 's face with an effort . When Max stopped speaking Claiborne raised his glass . " Vistas ! " he said . " For all of us . " Nobody paid any attention to him . Vera said , frowning a little : " I do n't care ! I do n't approve of artificial inseminationand I 'm not going to let Bud have anything to do with it . " Claiborne set his glass down , spilling some of the wine on the table . " Time marches on , " he said . " Ca n't let one good custom c'rupt the world . Bud 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling , then her face clouded . She thought that he was drunk . He averted his gaze from her shining eyes . He shook his head . " Who is Bud to be standing with reluctant feet where the brook and river meet ? Only a muley cow bull . That 's all he is . ' The girl beside him laughed suddenly . " He 'll have to stabilize on a higher level , " she said . He turned to her , nodding emphatically . " That 's it . All just matter of details . " " Details . . . ? " she repeated . " This vista 's been opened up , " he said , watching her face waver before him in the candlelight . Her face and hair and bare shoulders were all the same color . Did she know that her eyes were as green as grass ? She had told him that she wasp113thirty-four years old but she looked a hell of a lot younger than that , as women do when nothing that they want to have happen has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix her features more clearly , then fixed a heavy hand on her shoulder . " Take you . . . . Suppose you wanted to have a baby . . . by Winston Churchill . " He felt her shoulder give a little under his palm , then stiffen . Her laughter rang out , sounding fresh but faraway , like a waterfall gushing down a remote mountainside . " But I do n't . " He let his hand fall from her shoulder . " You ca n't tell , " he said . " Say you do n't want to have a baby by Winston Churchill right this minute , but might change your mind . Remember that . You might change your mind and want to have a baby by him later on . . . or by John L. Lewis . . . or Joe Louis ... . " You 'd still have to get Winston Churchill 's consent , " Max said . " Or John L. Lewis 's . . . or Joe Louis 's . . . " " Not necessarily . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron out , naturally . . . . Could be such a thing as too much Winston Churchill . . . or John L. Lewis . . . or Joe Louis . . . . Depend , of course , on how prepotent the sire was . . . . Vera said , " Torn ! " in a low voice . " Oh , all right ! " he said , and lifted the glass Gershon had just refilled and drank from it . " But you ca n't say it does n't open up vistas , " he muttered . Vera did not answer , only eyed him mournfully . He withdrew his gaze from hers and stared at the wine stain on the tablecloth . It was spreading . The last two times he had drunk from his glass he had spilled some of the wine . Gershon alwaysfilled glasses too full , but that did not excuse his spilling his wine on the cloth . They all thought he was drunk , but he did not see how he could be . He had had only two drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine . How could a man get drunk on that amount of alcohol ? It 's just that I 'm so damned tired , he told himself , and he thoughtp114of the young bull standing in his stall , slowly ruminating and gazing incuriously ahead of him , and of his daughter , the red heifer , in the stall across the runway , bedded down , no doubt , on sweet-smelling straw , with her daughter curled up beside her ; and it seemed to him that he ought to be standing in the darkness beside them , listening to their gentle breathing and laying his hand first on one and then another warm , hairy head , instead of sitting here at this table , this table which at any moment might be caught up and transported at the rate of God only knew how many million miles an hour to be set clown inside a great , brazen mechanism , shaped , perhaps , like a bull , in which he and his wife and their guests and everybody else they had ever known would be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archers had left and Robin had silently disappearedup the stairs they went into the library . Max went over to the record player . He asked them what they wanted to hear and when nobody answered said that he would play what he wanted to hear and put on the Beethoven " Pathetique . " Vera and Cynthia had sat down side by side on a sofa . Claiborne took a chair facing the women . They had not stopped talking because of the music but they talked in such low tones that lie could not hear what they said . Vera kept her eyes fixed on her cousin 's face and seemed to be listening intently to what Cynthia said but it was plain that she was tired ; she allowed her head to rest against the back of the sofa and her hands lay limp on each side of her . Cynthia 's hands were clasped in her lap . She sat poised lightly on the edge of the seat , almost as if she were riding sidesaddle . . . . His mother had ridden sidesaddle all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew who rode sidesaddle and she had stopped it after her first husband 's death . " I do n't know why , but I 'm afraid . I never was afraid till after Jim died . . . . " She would tell you all about it if she got enough liquor in her . Neither of them would look at him because they thought that he was drunk . But he was not drunk , just elevated enough to notice things that might have escaped him ordinarily : the two women 's heads , for instance , floating against the crimson sofa back as if placed there for display . You would not think that they were related if you did not know their history . Vera 's features were all short , upturned , highcolored , ardent . Cynthia 's nose was long , her lips pale , her hair the color of a dead leaf . She had a habit of turning her head a little to one side immediately after she made a remark . When she did that the muscles at the outer corners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bitter and at the same time avid look . " Meraude ! " Vera said . " Oh , by all means , Meraudel " Meraude was the name of a sewing woman she had discovered a year or so ago on the East Side and who , under her patronage , was being encouraged to give herself the airs of a grande couturiere . Vera always called her by the name Max had thought up for her and made Molly and Marcia and all the other women go to her . The thought of her protegee animated her now . She sat up straighter and for a moment lost her air of fatigue as she turned her brilliant eyes on her cousin . The eyes are the mirror of the soul . He had seen  --  or had he only fancied that he had seen ?  --  strangers in the act of being introduced to Vera involuntarily take a step backwardas if to avoid some impact . Cynthia was not listening very hard to what her cousin was saying . She turned her head aside again in that odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of some secret necessity , suddenly finds the company of others intolerable ? And what was the necessity ? Max had been tinkering with the volume and had finally got it to suit him . The sonata swelled softly , filled the room.  |p116The  " Pathetique . " Beethoven was twenty-nine when he wrote that . At thirty-three he was almost completely deaf . . . . As for me , I am dumb . Have been for a long time . Silence destroyed the Amyclae . They were dumb . Silent , I lost the Muse . Return , Apollo ! Gras amet qui numquam arnavit quique amavit cras amet . . . Allen Tate 's " Tomorrow may loveless , may lover tomorrowmake love " is better than Symons ' version of the refrain . Wish I 'd beat him to that . Have n't seen him in a long time . Do n't know that I 'd care to see him again . He opened his eyes . Max still sat in his corner , in the attitudehe was accustomed to take when he listened to music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported on his hands while he stared at the floor . Vera was sound asleep , her head turned sidewise against the back of the sofa , her arms brought up and folded across her breast . He thought at first that Cynthia had left the room , then caught sight of her standing at a window , looking out into the garden . He went over and stood beside her . She smiled at him faintly , then turned back to the window . The moon was up . The gravel of the walks showed between the flower beds . The brick wall that enclosed the garden was splashed with the black , swaying shadows of leaves . She said in a low voice : " I 'm going out and walk around a little . " " Yes , " he said , and moved beside her toward the door . They were halfway across the room when he heard a heavy tread behind them . " Believe I 'll take a turn too , " Max said . They were opposite the sofa where Vera lay asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maud Muller on a summer 's day , " he said , and suppressed a laugh.  |p117They  went through the hall and across the stone-cold terraceto set foot on gravel almost as cold . " We 'll go over and take a look at the Oratory , " Max told Cynthia . He called his little house " St. Cyprian 's Oratory , " in memory of the studio on L'Impasse des Deux Anges  --  a hangoverfrom his Joe Paster days . Joe called whatever hall bedroom he inhabited , in whatever run-down rooming house , " St. Benedict 's Oratory "  --  not the great St. Benedict but an obscure , eighteenth-century saint , Benedict Joseph Labre , who , unsuccessful in his attempts to become a monk , had turned tramp instead , and had been canonized in the year Joe was born . Max , who had been a good figure painter before he turned Vorticist , had presented Joe with a picture of " St. Benedict 's Cell "  --  a hole in a crumbling Roman wall . Joe carried the roll of canvas about with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been delighted with the idea of having a patron saint . Max had taken Cyprian , the exmagician , as his patron . Horne , after much cogitation , had adopted St. Polycarp . Polycarp , Claiborne mused . The name signifies " much fruit . " He had once looked St. Polycarp up in the encyclopedia and found that he had been burned in the amphitheater in the time of Commodus at the age of eighty-six . Horne had been thirty-two when lie leaped into the sea . . . . Cynthia had stopped to look back at the house . " It looks like Mio Sogno from here , " she said . " That vine there on the terrace . And that black tree going up beside it . " " That tree 's a Lombardy poplar , not a cypress , " he said , " and there are n't any steps going down there at the side of the house , and no fountain . " Max said : " Oh , come on ! " But she still stood gazing and after a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the lawn . " Like something Claude might have dreamed , " he said . Claiborne had been holding the gate open for them to pass through but now he withdrew his hand from the cold iron and let the gate swing to . The landscape seemed to him , too , like something seen in a dream , with its long stretches of blond , glimmering sward , broken at intervals by the leafy trees , each of which had the crescent of its own black shadow resting at its foot , like a garment half slipped off at the end of some play . A few hours ago he had stood here at this samep118gate with another woman . People in bright-colored clothes had moved about over the lawn while they stood here , talking  --  aboutwhat ? He could not remember . It seemed a long time ago and the place he stood in did not seem the same place . Even the trees did not seem the same . He stared at the nearest tree , the copper beech . Its trunk was gray but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boughs swayed gently forward . A shaft of moonlight raced up the gray trunk to disappear among the plumey boughs , like a creature surprised and seeking shelter . Max sighed . " Night like this I wish I was n't so old ! " Claiborne did not answer . The breeze still played among the boughs . Something live ran , glittering , from leaf to leaf . They have been here all along ! he thought . " Well , let 's take that turn in the garden , " Max said . He and Cynthia moved toward the gate . Claiborne let them pass through before him , then followed them down the box walk to the cottage at the end of the garden . Hollyhocks grew all about it , but the low-growing hedges that radiated out from it were of tansy and rue and Lad 's Love  --  Lad 's Love , God love us !  --  Max had a passion for growing herbs . Cynthia , walking a little ahead of the two men , stooped and thrust her hand down into a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It grows wild around Hyeres . Remember ? " and she held a leaf out to him . He lifted it to his nose and inhaled the clean , pungent odor , then thrust the leaf down into his pocket . Cynthia , still holding in her hand the branch she had broken off , walked across the little brick terrace and through the open door into Max 's cottage . It had been the cobbler 's shop in the old days . A large , square , beautifully proportioned room , whose four small windows when Max took it over had still contained what remained of the original panes of whorled , greenish glass .  |p119The  two east windows were still there , but the north window and the low ceiling had had to go when Max turned the place into a studio . The cavernous fireplace was still surmounted by its long , low pine mantel , and over in the corner was arelic that Max prized highly , a big square block of oak on which the cobbler laid the hides from which he cut the soles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold paints . He had switched on an overhead light . Cynthia stood in the middle of the floor looking up at the square of mine fleurs tapestry over the mantel : blond rabbits and birds with reddish feathers gleaming in their long tails hopping about a darkish background , among plants that looked as if they might have been drawn by Darer , every one of them with a blue or yellow or rose-colored blossom set among its olivecoloredleaves . " Max ! Do you deserve this ? " Max went over and stood beside her . He had started in on the story of how he got it , week-ending with old Sophy Douglass , year after year , just for the pleasure of looking at it , till old Sophy died and Dick Fenshaw happened to mention that all the stuff was going to Hall , Crashan . So he took the bull by the horns and went straight to Jessica Douglass . . . . " Look here , Jessica , do you think Sophy would want you to sell the rabbits ? " " But Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you see it in my house ? " " I certainly ca n't , " Max had said , and got on a chair and detached it from the wall and rolled it up and stuck it under his arm and walked out of the room . . . . Later she had written him that she remembered now that her mother once said that she wanted Joe Steiner to have the rabbits . . . . " Joe was in Europe . It was just a dodge to get it into her clutches . I wrote her that we must remember that Sophy knew things now that she did n't know when she was with us and that I was positive that she would loathe the idea of Joe Steiner having the rabbits . . . . She would , too . The old girl could look at a thing and tell whether it was good , but Jessica and Dick have to pay Woodcockto tell them what to like . " He disappeared into the back room where they could hear him still laughing while he cracked ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Claiborne did not move . She put her hand out and lifted a magazine from the tablep120beside her then suddenly laid it down and looked up at him and smiled a little . A moment later her features were impassiveagain but her eyes still sparkled , as if at some thought which was secret and which she yet wanted to share with him . But Max was coming through the door , bearing a loaded tray . She looked down at her hands folded in her lap . As Max walked past Claiborne to set the tray down on the table next to the sofa he gave Claiborne a quick look out of his black eyes . Claiborne stood where he was a second , watching the plump , deft hands hovering over the bottles and the glasses and the silver bowl filled with cracked ice , before he walked to the door and stood with his back turned , looking out over the garden . In the long bed immediately in front of the terrace the herbs were planted in rows that slanted like the spokes of a wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as neat as a pin , the whole enclosed by a low border of some plant with silvery leaves . That was the lavender into which Cynthia had just stooped to thrust her hand . Lavender grew all over those slopes back of Mio Sogno . . . . What had Cynthia meant by that look she gave him a minute ago ? The smile which accompanied it seemed to refer to some experiencethey had shared . Was it possible that when they had stood looking at that tree she had seen the same thing that he saw ? The look , the smile had seemed to say so . The ordinaryperson did not think that things happened that way , but he knew that they did . Once his days had been filled with such happenings , but not for a long time . . . . Max said : " Tom , here 's your drink . " Claiborne shook his head and walked back and sat down in the chair drawn up before the sofa . Max laughed as he set the highball back on the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ! " " I was doing well to get off the ground at all , " Claiborne said . " Do you realize that we 've been at this since eight o'clock this morning ? " " Yes , " Max said , " by then I was deep in the Overbecks '  |p121squashes  . " He stretched his legs , yawning , then reached over and patted Cynthia 's knee . " Think of having little Cynthia here ! " he said . " You like it ? " " I love it , " she said . " We have a good time , " Max said . " Do n't we , Tom ? But we do n't have this good a time every day . " " God forbid ! " Claiborne said , and wished he had not spoken , feeling the quick black eyes on his face again , but Max said only : " Tom does n't relish the pastoral the way Vee and I do . " Cynthia 's eyes met Claiborne 's . The same smile trembled on her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " It 's the best we can do , " Max said , " me and Vee and Bud  --  but poor Bud , he 's going to be mechanized . " " Caligula made his horse consul , " Claiborne said . " That bull will move in on us before we 're through . " Max shook his head . " Bud wo n't move in on you . He 's got it too soft as it is . " And so have you . . . and so have I. . . . Some men are born eunuchs , some men are made eunuchs by men , some men become eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdomof God . The words were Jesus Christ 's , but they came to him in Horne 's voice . When he was drunk enough Horne spoke of himself as a " holocaust . " The artist must sacrifice everything  --  including love of women  --  for the sake of his art , must burn himself up on the Muse 's altar . But it was the sea that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that picked his bones . She was not looking at him now but at Max , a glance that was bright and at the same time speculative . She was trying to reconcile Max 's suave , portly presence with the wild tales she had heard of his goings-on in Paris . " The Black Widow , " Joe Paster used to call Max in the first days of his bereavement . The trouble was that Max had been bereaved so often , for Horne would not even pretend to be faithful to him . He would even go after women . That time he took off for Majorca with Deedy Maslow , and Deedy , when they gotp122back , told everybody in boring detail how , night after night , duly fortified by resinous wine , they got into bed and nothing happened . " Simply nothing . I ca n't understand it ! " . . . Why had Horne kept trying ? That was the thing that in those days ran Max crazy , that Horne , every now and then , would go after some woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him , that he was a man who ought to have been able to love women ? Ile had made Horne terrible scenes whenever Ilorne showed any interest in a woman but he was calm enough when Horne went on the prowl . In fact those were Max 's happiest times , the mornings when Horne came home with a shiner or a wrenched back or beaten black and blue . . . . He remembered the first morning he had come on them like that : Horne , in bed in the little room back of the big curtain , his round jowls so congested with blood that they looked as if they might burst , a compress made of two towels wrapped about his neck , holding a slab of bi f tek to his eye  --  Max was a great one for old-fashioned remedies , usually ones that had been used by his grandmother . He had explained that the compress made of one wet towel encased in one dry towel had practically magical properties for the cure of almost any ailment . When he got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel out in boiling water Claiborne had observed the sidewise roll of his hips ; his old granny 's gait , which had grown on him with the years , had been apparent , though he was still slim then . Horne had been a bit subdued and at the same time a little complacent . It had been too much for him . He had got away from the lovebirdsas soon as he could , to walk up and down the Boulevard St. Germain in the October sunshine . Horne had made his first  --  and last  --  pass at Tom Claiborne two days after he arrived in Paris . They were strolling down Monsieur le Prince late at night and Horne had stopped and , pointing to a light that burned dimly over the entrance to a cheap hotel , had suggested that they go in and take a room . When Claiborne said no , that he was n't that way , Horne had given an odd , defiant laugh and they had walked on , talkingp123about Bateau Ivre . But the laugh had been followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shoulders . He had had the impression of a man trudging beside him buffeted by a storm invisible to mortal eyes . He had learned later that Horne was used to such rebuffs . Most of his friends , as he said once when he was drunk , he had " weighed in the balance and found wanting . " Joe Tyrone , Bob Waite , Jim Wragge , and their wives , all testified that Horne " never let it make the least difference , " but he could still remember the sick feeling that had swept over that young man ( he seemed to himself somebody he had known long ago ) standing there on Monsieur le Prince at two o'clock in the morning . It was n't hurt vanity ( he could still read that young man 's mind ) or even moral indignation . It was that Horne had had to laugh like that ! . . . Cynthia set her glass down with a little click and leaned forward . " Do you see what I see ? " she said . Max sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a fat pigeon that in the act of dusting itself suddenly realizes that it is being admired . " Vera gave it to me on my birthday two years ago , " he said . " It was too sweet of her ! I told her it was too sweet of her . But Lord , I 'm only human ! " She was on her feet and moving toward the opposite wall where the picture hung . Max went over and stood beside her . Claiborne did not even need to raise his eyes to see that picture . All circles , one within another until you came to the last circle that was smaller than a bull 's eye and black as night . A technical feat , certainly . But there was something about Carlo 's pictures that he had never been able to stomach . Was it the color or the movement ? " It 's the rhythm of life , " Vera once said . " I doubt that . The trouble with you is that you were raised on a bunch of baloney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now he 's dead , so of course you can say anything you want to about him . "  | " If he was ever any good as a painter he 'd be just as alive today as he ever was , but I do n't believe he was ever any good . I 've thought so for years . " " If that is so , it must be painful to you to have The Fountain ' hanging in the library . " " I do n't have to look at it . I 've got so I can look straight through it and never see it . " " You 'll never see it again ! " she had cried , and caught up a pair of nail scissors and would have rushed downstairs in the middle of the night to slash the picture if he had n't caught her wrist and held it . " You touch that picture  --  now or any other time  --  and I 'll give you a beating you 'll never forget . " She had finally cried herself to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both of them when she remembered the next day that Max 's birthday was only a week off . . . . " No , I want him to have it ! After all , he likes it . " Her lip had trembled . They would have been off on the old merry-go-round if he had n't taken himself off for a walk . . . . He stood up . " Cynthia , I 'm going to bed . You coming ? " " She has n't finished her drink , " Max said . " She can stay here and finish it if she wants to , " Claiborne said . But she was already on her feet . Max went with them halfway , then turned back , walking slowly , whistling a song Claiborne had not heard in years : Adieu ma mie , adieu mon coeur , Adieu , mon esperance ... . They had taken a different path from the one they had followed a while ago and now they came into the great circle of box that had been planted to set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlo had ever executed . It was of dark green marble , the kind that would show yellow veined in the daylight but here in the moonlight looked almostblack . The water that lay in its depths was motionless and dark too , except for a faint shimmer where it spilledp125over the curved edge of the great round to fall into a larger , shallower round below . He would have passed it unseeing but Cynthia stopped to stare . " It is the same fountain , is n't it ? " she asked . He said : " Oh yes . Vera had it brought over when they sold Mio Sogno . " She went nearer and bent and dipped her hand in the water . " It looks so strange here , " she said . " Carlo designed it for Provence , not for Bucks County . " She bent lower , plunging her hand deep into the water , then looked up at him sidewise . " You do n't like it , do you ? " she asked suddenly . " I 'm old-fashioned , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something . This water does n't seem to move till it hits the rim . " She straightened up . " It 's like his pictures , " she said . He was silent . " Are you tired ? " she asked suddenly . " Yes . Are n't you ? " She shook her head in negation then stood on tiptoe , stretching her arms high over her head . " I do n't think I 'll ever be tired again ! " " That must be a nice feeling . " She laughed . " All evening I 've been thinking about Mrs. Salisbury Hawks . . . . " " Of Rapulgee , Wizconzin ? " " The dean 's wife . She was at home every Sunday afternoon . . . . " And you ? " " I had to be at home on Saturdays . Every Saturday . For seven years . " " And now you do n't ? " " Oh no . Never again . " " It 's not all beer and skittles in these parts , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe , " he said . " Oh yes , " she said , and stooped to plunge her hand again in the darkly shining water , then turning to him impulsively ,  |p126laid  it , still wet from the fountain , on his arm . " You 're tired . We ought to go in . " " I suppose we ought , " he said , and started up the gravel path . She walked beside him . Her hand still lay lightly on his arm . He could feel its chill through his thin coat sleeve . A drop of water fell on the gravel between them . He put his own hand up and laid it for a second over her cold hand , then looked up to see where the moon had gone . When they had come this way a half-hour ago it had been almost directly over their heads , but it must be traveling west now ; ahead of each of them his own black shadow wavered . The facade of the house looked white with the moonlight beating full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner of the sofa . She heard their footsteps and opened her eyes and smiled . " Coyne on , " he said , " let 's go to bed . " She stood up  --  then , as if her legs had given way , sank back on the sofa and , still smiling , held out her arms . He stooped and she clasped her awns around his neck and he carried her from the room and up the stairs . The odor of her body , indescribablebut as familiar to him as the rhythm of his own breath , came to him , mingled with the fragrance of flowers and the smell of cow dung . He felt his lips shaping a grin as he strode up the stairs with his burden . Cynthia had stayed behind to turn off the lights but he could hear her now mounting lightly behind him . As she came abreast of them Vera lifted her head languidly . " Have you got everything ? " " Everything , " Cynthia said , and opened the door of Vera 's bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipped down the hall to her own room while he carried Vera in and laid her down on her bed . She lay for a second in the same position in which he had put her down , then , giving a long sigh , turned over on her face . Her husband stood looking down at her . " You 're done in , are n't you ? " he said . She murmured something . He laughed and sitting down on the bed beside her , laid his hand on the small of her back.  | " Come on , Vee ! It 's all over now . Do n't you want to get in bed ? " There was no answer except her long , sighing breaths . He unfastened her dress and drawing her to a sitting position , slipped it over her head . She fell sidewise like a rag doll , her eyes still closed . He pulled her up off the bed long enough to draw the covers down , then stripped her of her underwear and pushed her gently in between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Darling , " and , curving her arm about his neck , held his cheek against hers , laughing a little . He said , " Wait a minute ! " and turning off the light , stripped off his clothes , and getting naked into bed , pulled the warm , pliant body up against his own . Later he woke with a start . The illuminated hands of his watch told him that it was four o'clock . Another hour till daylight and another two or three hours before anybody would be stirring in the house . Vera lay on her back , breathinglightly . As if unconsciously registering the movement he had just made , she suddenly flung one arm out so that it lay athwart his chest . The arm was warm and heavier than you would have thought such a slight arm could be . He endured the warmth , the light pressure for several minutes before he turned over and lying with his back to her stared before him into the dark . That bunch of clothes there on the floor looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something curled like a worm lay at a little distance from one limp sleeve . The spray of lavender Cynthia had handed him a while ago , saying that lavender grew all over the hills around Mio Sogno . . . . Who knew that better than he ? He looked at his watch again . Seven minutes past four . Those objects on the floor were all in shadow now . Was the moon quite gone from the garden ? He got up and went on bare feet out onto the balcony . There was no glitter left on leaf or bough but between the dark shapes of the trees the sky showed a faint salmon color . The moon must just have gone down . Or was that color re/flected from the eastern sky ? Was that dawn ? He brought his clenched fist down on the cold iron of the balustrade . " They think I 'm through , " he said half aloud . " But I 'm not . They 'll see . I 'm not through yet ! " and went back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping figure he had just left , before he passed into his own room.  |p131Claiborne  entered his study , turned , and as was his custorn , locked the door behind him . He had been locking the door ever since one of the maids , coming in with a message after her repeated taps had been ignored , had found him asleep on the sofa . The room faced east and was flooded with morning light . He and Vera had taken great trouble with its furnishings when they moved here twelve years ago . They had both been very much pleased when Claiborne acquired a plantation desk that had belonged to one of his great uncles , but he had soon found that it slanted too much to hold a typewriter and was an inconvenient height when he wanted to write by hand , and he had abandoned it for a small pine table which he kept pushed up in front of one of the windows . The rest of the furnishings were early American , to match the desk : four small " chicken coop " Hitchcock chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Dutch settles . Over the mantel hung a family portrait , his greatgranduncleDanvers Claiborne at the age of five or six , in buff-colored pantaloons and a frilled shirt , feeding his game chickens . The boy 's hair was the color of butter , the cock 's body bright orange , its feathers a bluish-green where they were not crimson . The picture had hung in the parlor at Eupedon . Tom Claiborne had liked having it here over the mantel and had often glanced up at it when he first took possessionof this room . But that had been in the days when hep132was still able to work . It struck him as odd that when he was working he was more acutely aware of his surroundings than when he was not working . It had been a long time now since he had actually observed any object in this room  --  except one , the old-fashioned sofa , covered with black leather , that stood in a far corner . He had bought it at a country auction because it reminded him of the sofa his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the room now , and looked with aversion at the table which held his typewriter . There was a pile of typewritten sheets lying beside the typewriter and the machine held a sheet of paper half covered with typing . He had begun an essay on Keats several months ago for Spectra but the essay was long overdue  --  so long overdue that Bob Waite had stopped telephoning or telegraphing him about it . He had had some ideas about Keats when he started the essay , but they did not seem important now , and as he stood in the middle of the sunlit room he thought of his fellow poet with cold envy ; Keats had been dead by the time he was twenty-six . He adjusted one of the blinds so that the sunlight was a little tempered , then went over and lay down on the sofa . His blank gaze suddenly fixed upon his own books , two of poetry and four of critical essays , that Vera had had bound in expensive vellum  --  all six of them ranged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . . . . " Erudition and wit expressed in a prose of classical ordonnance , at once powerful and subtle . " . . . He shifted his eyes to the window . The view from this corner was always the same : a patch of blue sky , with , thrusting up into it , the tops of two tall Lombardypoplars . Vera liked them because they had the same shape as the cypresses she had loved in the country around Hyeres . No matter how hard he looked at the trees and the sky there was always something else in his field of vision : the row of drawers that formed the lower part of the old desk . The manuscript of the long poem he had begun when he first came here to live lay in one of them . Eight sheets ofp133paper , meticulously typed ( oh , he could always type somethingup once he got it written ! ) , fastened together with a rusted paper clip and themselves already faintly yellowed . The other sheets of paper , on which he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gone into the wastebasket , to be hauled off by old Dan , the garbage collector , and burned on some dump , or , more likely , sold to the ragmanto be made into paper on which some other fool could say what he thought he had to say . As for him , he had , besides a few critical articles , only these eight already yellowing sheets of paper to show for almost twelve years ' work . Twelve years ? Forty-seven years ! For every time you wrote a poem you put all you had and every year you had lived into it . Well , they could not say ( who was it he was always expecting to say something ? ) that he had not tried . He had sat there , day after day , hour after hour , or walked about the room , or stood looking out of the window , or had lain here on this sofa , with his eyes closed as now , sweating , sweating , until it seemed that all the sweat and all the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dry manikin of skin and bone . There was something  --  he did not know what it was  --  that tied him to the creature , and so he paced the room when it paced the room or stood beside it at the window or sat at his desk while it fumbled among his papers and then one day it had turned its head and he saw that it was grinning , and he took the eight pages and put them in one of the lower drawers of the desk and closed it . That was six months ago . He had not opened the drawer since then . But there would have to be a reckoning eventually . Vera thought that he was still working on his poem . If you told her that you had sweated blood all morning and had not been able to write a damn word she would look at you as if the world had come to an end . He had not been able to bear that look and so he had fallen into the habit of deceivingher . Nowadays his most strenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five lines ? No , it was day before yesterday I told her I wrote five lines . Safer top134make it three . Or maybe this is one of those days when I did n't get anything done but feel like I might be able to write something tomorrow . . . . Into each life some rain must fall . So do n't you worry about me , little girl . Just get on with your farm work . . . . He raised his hand and laid it on his forehead so that his eyes were covered . " I am in a bad way , " he whispered to someone who seemed to stand always a little behind him . " Ca n't you see that I am in a very bad way ? " There was no answer . When could there ever be any answer ? After a few minutes he moved his hand and opened his eyes . Some of the poplar leaves were showing yellow , but the patch of sky visible through the window was as blue as any summer sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dream , only water . He had had the dream again last night , for the first time in months . But he had had it at irregularly recurring intervals for as long as he could remember . A man and a river . A river broader than the Amazon , which he had read about as a child in his geography books , broader than any river that ever flowed . Sometimes the man stood on the bank , with another person  --  was it a woman ?  --  beside him . But oftenest he moved with the current , riding sometimes in a boat , or plunged deep in the waves . Then the banks of the river would seem so far away or so wreathed in mist that he could not even make out what trees grew there . The current flowed smoothly . The Ian seemed one with its movement until a certain moment when another current flowing into the stream enveloped his moving limbs with waves so soft , so arresting , that tie stayed his course and , looking off over the broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream it was always the left bank ) the cavern yawning . The dream alwaysended with that moment . He had never seen anything more than the cavern 's mouth , a wide , overhanging ledge which glowed as if illuminated from within , had known it only as a place that would welcome him , that yawned for him if he ever left the main stream and swam toward it.  |p135There  was a knock at the door . He got up off the couch and , running his hand over his rumpled hair , debated whether he should open it . One of the maids , no doubt , with a messagefrom Vera . But their knocks of late had been timorous and sometimes they would knock only once and then , if there was no answer , go away . The knock came again , soft but firm , as if the person making it were determined to be admitted . He opened the door . It was Vera . She was evidently on her way to the field ; she wore blue denim and had her " carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Come in . . . . Well , what are you up to this morning ? " " We 're going to cut the Ladino this morning , " she said . " Who 's going to ride the binder ? " he asked . She called the machine the tractor but he always gave the machine the name he had known it by as a boy . She said : " Rodney , " and then hesitantly , " would you like to  --  for a while ? " He shook his head . " I 've got some things to do . " Her face lighted up , or rather , reflected , for a second , a radiance by which it might have been transformed if the radiance had not faded so quickly . She took an almost simplemindedpleasure in her own " day 's work " and every morning went forth and solemnly slopped pigs or cleaned out stalls or performed any other of the chores ordinarily turned over to hired men . But there was a thorn in her flesh . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced that he was enjoying himself too . She had as much notion of the dangers  --  and delights  --  of writing lyric poetry as one of her own muley cows , but she got uneasy when he went through one of his long " dry " periods . Still , she was  --  at forty  --  one of the most gullible of God 's creatures . He could make her happy , for the whole day , for weeks to come , by saying what he could so easily say  --  for he was good at such maneuvers  --  that he had got hold of the end of a line that he thought he would keep or had a notion that it would take him some time to work out or had found a book that hep136found stimulating . Any one of these dodges would send her out of the room , reeling with delight , to work in the hay field till the sweat ran off her like rain  --  there was nothing she liked more than getting up a good sweat . But he would be damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had sat down on the sofa and was apparently absorbed in rearranging the contents of the pockets of the apron of undressed leather in which she carried the tools she thought she might need in her " day 's work . " She drew a diminutive pair of pliers out of one of the pockets and held it up , frowning . " Tom . . . " she said . " Well ? " " I 'm worried about Robin . " " What 's he up to ? " " I do n't think he 's up to anything . " " Is n't that his usual condition ? " She stowed the pliers carefully away in one of the pockets . " I wish he did have something to occupy him , " she said after a moment . " It 's a little late in the day for that , is n't it ? " " He 's only thirty . " " Yes , but he 's never hit a tap in his whole life . I ca n't see him starting now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could if . . . " " If what ? " " If he were married , for instance . " Clairborne laughed . " Some woman will have to marry him . He 'll never take the initiative . " " That 's what I 'm afraid of . " " Why , you 've just intimated that you 'd like to see him married . " She was silent , head bent , untying the strings of her apron and then retying them more firmly about her waist . When she looked up she said : " Do you think I 'm getting fat ? " " No , " he said . " Look here . Something 's on your mind . Is Robin in the toils of some femme fatale ? " She nodded . " I think she might be . "  | " Might be what ? " " Fatal  --  for him . " " For God 's sake , Vera , what are you talking about ? " " Why , " she said as if bewildered , " I 'm talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're togetherlately ? " " As a matter of fact , I have n't . But then , as you know , I do n't pay much attention to what goes on around here . " " No , " she said . " You think there really may be something going on between them ? " " I do n't know . " " But you would n't approve if there were ? " She was silent . Her silence made him uneasy . No , it was not the silence . It was that blue gaze of hers . He could remember a time when he had seemed to bask in its effulgence . But not now . Not for a long time . Sometimes he dreamed of walking across a field , or some vast expanse , whose every blade , every leaf was bathed in shining light . But the light , the radiance had seemed to him intolerable and he walked steadily , head down , toward the place he had glimpsed where there was no grass , no leaf , no light , only velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something going on between them ? It might be a good thing for Robin . Anything to put some life into him . He goes around here like a zombie . " She said with a sob : " He was nearly killed . " " He had a bad time in the war , Vera , but good God , so did a lot of other men . He 's still got both legs , even if one is shorter than the other . " " I 'm not talking about the war ! " she cried . " I 'm talking about when he was six years old and loved so to go to Cassis with Denis but he promised Leontine that he would never get out of the car and he never did  --  till she told him that Denis would n't know and then they saw Denis crossing the place just as they were coming out of the patisserie and Robin started running and the car knocked him down andp138would have run over him if the brakes had n't held . Oh ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to write your memoirs . " She had been sitting , her hands twisted together in her lap , staring at the floor as if she still saw the ancient **25;9351;TOOLONG and the shining engine of destruction , with the child fallen before its wheels . But at the sound of his voice she looked up at him , as intently , or so it seemed to his disturbed fancy , as if she had never seen him before . She laughed . " I do n't have to write anything ! " she cried . " No , " he said , " you have a resident writer . " Her wide , fixed gaze did not waver . Suddenly her body was convulsed by a long sob . " Oh , " she cried , " what are we saying ? " " Nothing , " he said , " nothing that matters . We are both tired . " " That 's it , " she said . " We 're tired . Both of us . . . And there are too many people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " he said , " nothing but the human condition and we ca n't remedy that in one morning . " She laughed . " No , not this morning , " she said , and murmuredthat she must be about her work . " Yes , " he said . " The sun is high . " " Good-bye , darling , " she said . " Good-bye , darling , " he said , and kissed her and when she had left the room went back and lay down on the sofa and raised his hand and laid it across his forehead so that his eyes were covered , pondering the origins of his dreams , those dreams in which he confronted a vast expanse that must be traversed or stood beside a river whose banks were so wide he could not see across it . He could not remember the first time he had had the dream about the river but he did remember a moment  --  it must have been when he was about tenyears old  --  when , standing with his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed to stand beside a strange  |p139woman  on the shore of a sea that was now green , now some shade of purple , but always illimitable and cold . Some vagary of puberty , no doubt . George Crenfew could ticket it and drop it into its proper pigeonhole if he asked him about it . But I 'll be damned if I will , he thought , even if I do spend most of my time on the couch ! There was a knock on the door , this time a sharp knock . It came again , brisker and louder . He grinned and went to the door and opened it . Cynthia Vail stood there in a white dress , carrying a Manila folder under one arm . She said : " Would you look at these translations ? " She spoke in a low voice , as if indifferently , but her lips twitched as she uttered the words , so wryly that she seemed almost to grimace at him . And he , on the other side of the door , had grinned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , child , I have n't read any Latin for years , " but as he spoke one hand went out to take the folder from her while the other motioned her to a chair , then , turning his back on her , he went over and sat down at his desk and spread the folder open before him . There were only six sheets of paper in the folder . A few lines were written on the first sheet in a clear small script . Below the text was her translation of the poem . He read the poem and then read her translation . When he had finished he laid the sheet of paper down carefully and sat for a moment looking out of the open window . In the south meadow red cows moved slowly about , knee-deep in alfalfa . A man and a woman stood leaning on the fence , watching them : Vera and Tom Abel , the dairyman . Vera 's figure looked dwarfish beside that of the lean dairyman . From time to time they turned their heads solemnly toward each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their line breedings and their outcrosses , no doubt , or trying to decide whether to graze off that alfalfa or save it for hay . Vera no longer consulted him about these matters . But why should she ? For him her actions had beenp140so long divorced from reality that they had lost all significance . This sharp pain he felt was not because his wife was so self-sufficient but because this woman sitting here behind him had used the English language with a precision and power that he would not have thought her capable of . His big hand moved slowly to reveal the second sheet of paper . She had copied her poem out in the same small , unwaveringscript . He read it through twice . His hand fell to his side . With an effort he kept his fingers from clenching on air . She was still sitting there behind him , in the same chair , doubtless in the same position . You have got to get used to seeing somebody else do it . It 's not as if you were still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get it into your head that you 're through ? He heard behind him a short soughing of breath . She realized that he had finished reading the poem . He turned around . " How long have you been at this ? " he asked . She sat with her hands folded in her lap , her eyes downcast . She was not the same color as these women around here . That was what gave her that look of a being in whom animation was suspended , a marble woman . The eyes opened suddenly , gleamed into his . She said : " Seven years . I started writing  --  or trying to write  --  soon after I married . " " But you 'd had your Latin before then ? " She shook her head . " In college I majored in art appreciation . Nobody told me any better . " " They all ought to be taken out and strung up by their thumbs , " he said absent-mindedly . " How did you get your classics , then ? " " Lester gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to realize how little I 'd need . " He smiled . " When you love the stuff . " He laid the translationaside and picked up the sheet of paper that held her poem . " I 'll read the others later . I want to think about this one a while first . "  |p141She  closed her eyes again . Her head , on its thin neck , turned suddenly to one side while her lips drew downward in that same odd gesture which , when he had observed it before , had reminded him of a person who , beset by an intolerablethirst , suddenly finds the company of his fellow men insupportable . He said : " Good Lord ! This is n't the court of last appeal , you know . " She looked up at him . " It is for me . " " That 's very nice , " he said . " Very nice , indeed ! But you know there are other people who could advise you just as well as I can . " " Who ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shrugged . " But Bob ca n't read poetry ? No . As a matter of fact , he never could . . . . But he and Jim Wragge are both still in there , pitching . " " You feel you 're not ? " " I have n't been able to write anything for a long time , " he said , then added hastily , " But let 's not talk about that . How many of these things have you got ? " She let out another soft breath , smiling a little . " But you 've read only one of my poems ! " He smiled too . " I do n't need to read any more  --  right now . Have you got enough to make a book ? " " Eighteen , " she said . " Twelve poems . Six translations . " " You have n't spent your time translating Ausonius ? " " There are three from Tibullus . One from Callimachus . " He whistled . " As good as the one I 've read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . How can you judge ? When you work all alone . Nobody to tell you anything . " He said : " Strikes me you 've had some pretty good people telling you things . . . . Well , it 's a pretty sight ! " " A pretty sight ? " " To see the ship leave the harbor , so well loaded . Does n't often happen these days . Most of ' em ca n't read English ,  |p142much  less Latin or Greek . You must have worked very hard . " " I have n't done anything else . . . for seven years . " " Well , it 's paid off . " " You think I 'll be able to go on ? " " I think you 'll be a fool if you do n't . " " Then you think I 'll have  --  a career in letters ? " she askedin what he was already calling to himself her " dry " voice . " Oh yes . There wo n't be any trouble about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " And there are not very many people who are ? " " Exactly . " She got up and took a few rapid steps about the room . Her hands , held tightly clasped in front of her , shook a little . If he touched them now they would be hot yet clammy ; there was a light film of sweat on her upper lip . " You 'll help me ? " she said . " Of course , " he said , and added after a moment , " What else could I do ? " " Not help me , " she said in the same low , dry voice . He shook his head slowly . " No-o , I could n't do that . " She took a few more steps about the room , then sat downand faced him . " What will you do first ? " He considered , his head on one side . " Let 's see . Bob has already published three of the poems , has n't he ? Did he tell you he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He needs stirring up . Always has . We 'll make him likethem better . . . . I 'll give him three or four of these newpoems and a couple of the translations before you see him . " " And you 'll tell him you like them ? " " I 'll convey to him the notion that they have  --  arrested my attention . " " So that 's the way it 's worked , " she said . " Not necessarily . That 's my way . Now if you 'd fallen into Joe Solmes 's hands . . . On second thought I doubt if he 'd take you on . You are n't bizarre enough . If you were an oldp143maid , now , who wore her dresses down to her toes and had never had a drink in her life , or a putative Lesbian . . . or had spent your life in the North Woods . . . or . . . or in domestic service . . . But a girl from the Middle West ! . . . From Massillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She laughed . " Aunt Margot was born in Massillon , and look where she got to ! " " All the way to Mio Sogno ! . . . Yeah , I 've often wondered . . . . " She smiled , but her eyes went past him to rest on the Manila folder where it lay on the desk . A moment ago she had made an almost imperceptible movement as if to rise again , then had sunk back in her chair ; she was still enough in awe of him not to make a move until she was dismissed . But her thoughts were not of him now . She had what right now she wanted more than anything : his pledge to help her . He would not take it back if he could and he could not take it back if he would . He was a godsend for her , all right . But was she not a godsend for him too ? . . . What shalle we do now , Enobarbus ? Thinke and dye . . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cud not spewed from your own entrails . . . . She had what she wanted . She 'd like to get off now and do a bit of gloating : " Tom Claiborne thinks my stuff is good . Yes , he really likes it ! " . . . If she went he would be alone in this room ! . . . In this room ! But she was not going . Her hands had folded themselves again tranquilly in her lap , her eyes left the folder , came back to his face and dwelt on it wonderingly . Like a long-desired , cooling bath , the tranquillity , the attention , the wonder ! . . . I really am one hell of a fellow , a fact that ought to be paid more attention to , a fact that has been wellnighlost sight of , a fact . . . The very shape of your sentencesreflects a disordered mind . . . . Never mind that . . . . " Wondered ? " Did she say she had wondered too ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had uttered . Made conversation a pleasure . . . . " Yes . . . . What I mean is . . . Well , Margot was pretty well dissolved in liquor when I came on the scene . " " She was pretty far gone when I came on the scene , " she said thoughtfully . " How old were you then ? " " Eleven , my first visit . " " A strange household for an eleven-year-old girl to tumble into  --  fresh from Ohio . . . . You know , it 's odd . I can rememberyour being around , but I ca n't remember what you looked like . " She said composedly : " I was small for my age , and on the mousy side . It was a strange household  --  for a person of any age . " " People used to say it was all Carlo 's fault , that Margot would have been different if he had paid more attention to her .

" " No , but I always called him that . " " I never saw the fellow in the flesh . Knew him only by his work . . . . And it never smelled right to me . . . . What 's the matter with you ? " For she was laughing , so hard that she felt the need to bend over to hide her face . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " It 's a private joke . " " Must be a good one . " " No . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh ' and I thought of the first time I ever saw Uncle Carlo. "  | " In Massillon or at Mio Sogno ? " " In Massillon , " she said gravely . " On the Fourth of July . He had n't been back for years and there was a picnic on the banks of the river . All the Clancys and the Vincenzi . . . " " They were Vincenzi in Massillon and Vincents in Rome . How Fortune doth spin her wheel ! " " Old Mr. Vincenzi was still alive then , " she said . " He was a marble-cutter . One of those men who could bend an iron bar with his bare hands . " " Did he ? " " Uncle Carlo asked him to do it and was most attentive during the performance and then Mr. Vincenzi sang a Neopolitansong and they all laughed a lot and the father and the two sons walked down and swam in the river . " " What 's funny about that ? " Her lips trembled again . " I suppose I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an Adonis too . Old Mr. Vincenziwas a giant , so he stayed lean all his life . So did Roberto and Giuseppe . But Uncle Carlo was beginning to sag here and there . " " What a cruel little minx you are ! Wo n't allow the poor man to take on a little weight . . . . He must have been in his forties then . " Her lips still trembled in that secret smile . " It was n't the weight ! " " Come on , now , give ! You know how dull it is around here . " She said : " Have n't you ever seen any of his later work ? " " We 've got the last thing he painted downstairs . " " I mean later than that . . . . The last few years . " He said slowly : " When they found him dead there in the studio  --  died all alone , like Alfred Henry Watson , by the way  --  the place was full of stuff .

" She said , " No , " on an even note and rose . " You are n't going ? It 's hours till lunch . " " Oh , I must . " " Without telling me what 's so funny ? " " I told you . " " Oh , no , you did n't ! " " You 've never looked at any of the later pictures ? " " I told you Vera burned them up . I do n't see what else she could have done  --  if that was what he wanted . Still , some people would have thought twice before throwing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Max was wild ! I was venal enough to wish that he might have had some of the can-vasses . " She was moving toward the door . " Maybe he 'll get them yet . " " You mean you think they might be tucked away somewhere ? Oh , no . Vera made a thorough job of it . She would , once she 'd set herself to it . " Her hand was on the knob , her eyes firmly downcast , her lips no longer smiling . But he knew that the minute the door was between them she would be smiling again . At him ? Or at Vera ? There was something she knew which made a fool out of one or the other or of both of them . He said : " There is something about those pictures . . . What is it ? " She said hesitatingly : " On my last visit I got to Mio Sogno a month before Uncle Carlo died . " " And you saw the pictures ? You were allowed to enter the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You were in there when Vera burned the pictures ? " " I went into the studio with Vera the day she found himdead . . . . I was in it again on one other occasion . " " When was that ? "  | " Somebody  --  somebody in the family had to help her . " " You helped her burn the pictures ? " " No . " He said suddenly : " You do n't believe that she burned the pictures . " " No . " " Why do you think she did n't burn the pictures ? " " Because I helped her wrap them up and pack them in a long box . " " To be sent where ? " " I do n't think they were sent anywhere  --  then . " " But you think that they were dispatched somewhere later . Where ? " " I should imagine that they have been reposing in your attic for the last twelve years , " she said . " Have you ever looked ? " " Why , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from Mio Sogno . But I never thought anything about it . " " Why should you think anything about it ? " she asked lightly . " There 's no reason , except that you 've excited my curi-osity . " " About Uncle Carlo 's later pictures ? I do n't think it mattersmuch what they 're like , do you ? He 's been dead twentytwoyears . " " An artist is never dead  --  if he was ever alive . " " Do you think he was ever alive ? " " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " I 've wondered . I think he got off to a good start . There 's something very impressive about his early work . And then something happened . lie took the wrong turn , somehow . . . . I 've never quite figured it out . He must have had the same notion , or he would n't have left orders for those later pictures to be burned . I 've always wished I 'd seen those later pictures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go up in your attic and see them . " " Provided you 're right about the pictures being there . "  | " Provided I 'm right . " His hand suddenly closed over her thin hand that was turning the knob . " Let 's go find out now . " She drew a little away from him . " I 'm supposed to go swimming with Robin at eleven . " " To hell with swimming . And Robin . This is much more fun . " She looked up at him , laughing . " It is fun ! " she said.  |p150The  attic was enormous , lighted only by small windows level with the floor , on the east and west . Sunlight lay in a quiveringpool on the floor and illuminated the corners of the room , where articles of furniture , shrouded in dust cloths , stood , with smaller objects heaped around them . Claiborne stopped at the head of the stairs to draw a long breath . " Do n't you like the smell of attics ? " he inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stopped and lifted from the floor a square , formed by tubes made of cast iron arranged in a row . " Candlestick mold , " he said . " Found it right here in this spot first time I ever came up here . . . . And there 's the bench the former owner was laid out on . . . . Vera thinks it 's too grim to have downstairs . . . . Great God ! There 's the White Powder Wonder ! " He crossed the floor at a bound to lift from where it leaned against a chair a long object cased in canvas . He held it in his hand a moment and looked down on it intently . She came up to stand beside him . He turned the case in his hand and showed her the initials " T.C. " marked crudely in ink in the lower left-hand corner of the case . " The first shotgun I ever had . The White Powder Wonder . George Crenfew got his the same Christmas . His was called the Hammerless Choke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first thing we had a chance to shoot  --  legitimatelywasdoves . The next August . We used to pop away at sparrowsduring the year . But we never let my father know that . He was a very correct man  --  in his way . " " You 're not even going to look at it ! " she said , for he was carefully replacing the shotgun , still in its canvas case , in the same position . " My sporting days are over , " he said , and moved forward slowly . She moved beside him . They stopped before an easel which held a picture framed in black : a fat yellow bird perched upon a sagging spray of lilac . " My mother 's sister , Lucy , executed that work while in a state of trance at the Convent of the Visitation in Washington , " he said . " She died at the age of nineteen . Her works were therefore religiously preserved . " She bent over the picture . " It 's not painted . It 's embroidered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was staring at a black leather couch half visible between two boxes of old books . It swayed to one side : the leg that he and George Crenfew had broken when they were scuffling on it one day had never been properly repaired . The leather was torn in places but the metal buttonsthat tufted it glinted even in this light . Those buttons shone even on the dullest day . . . . It had been up here all this time and he had been fool enough to go out and buy one for himself . She was raising the lid of an old trunk to lift from the top of a heap of garments a long black cloak . " Your father 's ? " " No , " he said curtly . " His father 's . She heard me say once that he wore it at the Nashville Convention of 185o and so she had to bring it up here . " He raised his head sharply and drew in through distended nostrils the warm air which a moment ago he had found pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leave them alone ? Why ca n't she let them stay where they were !  | " She has the money to send anything anywhere she wants to send it , " a low voice said . He stared at her . Surely he had not spoken his thought aloud ! But she did not seem to think that anything extraordinaryhad happened . She was not even looking at him , but gazing about the vast , cluttered room , a faint smile on her lips . He gave an uneasy laugh . " We 'll have to face it , " he said . " Vera 's a bit of a magpie . . . . None of this stuff is worth a damn to anybody . " " One wonders why she troubles to pay freight on it , " she said in the same low voice , a voice in which she might almost have been talking to herself , so little ( lid she seem aware of his presence . " Well , as you say , she has the money , and then it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stuff from Mio Sogno ? " She laughed and pointed to a marble statue in another corner of the room . " That 's not the work of the great Essentist ! " he said . " Why , hello , it 's Flora ! " He set his big hand on the garlanded head and turned the female figure so that it faced them . " Remember ? Flora , from the garden . She used to stand opposite that big La Peyre . The one that was all hips . Vera sold the La Peyre , but nobody would want this baby . " " No , " she said , " the flowers look as if they had been crocheted . . . . I used to wonder how they could bear to have those two statues in the same garden .

He could not discuss his wife with this woman or anybody else . But he did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if he had escaped some danger and at the same time had missed an opportunity that might not come again . When he had been talking with her in his study he had felt himself alive all over  --  for the first time in many months . The same feeling had swept over him a moment ago . It had seemed that they were talking about something very important  --  until his sense of decorum made him change the subject.  |p153She  spoke again . " You said it was insurance . . . ? " He was so relieved that his words came in a rush . " Against a kind of animism that besets her . She might wake up some night and not be able to sleep for thinking of poor old Flora out in the rain . What 's simpler than to bring poor old Flora over here where she 'll stay high and dry ? . . . If Vera 's fond of a person it 's hard for her to discard his old glove . . . . That couch over there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father spent the best years of his life on it , so Vera had it shipped up here . " " What was your father like ? " " Very handsome man . One of the best wing shots in Kentuckyand Tennessee . Good high duck shot too . And successfulwith the ladies . " " How did your mother like that ? " " It made her life a hell on earth . " " And she took it out on you ? " " If she did she did n't know it , " he said , then heard with surprise , his own hard voice . " Joe Ryan was the best tenant we ever had . Five acres of tobacco , year in , year out . But he had one girl that went wrong . I will say for the old man that he was n't the first . He gave her a rubber check . She got sore and brought it up to the house . Early in the morning . Uncle Dod was just bringing in the milk . My mother had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood aside to let this girl go first .

' " " What did your mother do ? " " She looked at the girl , then looked past her , and she turned her head to one side and shrieked . I only heard that sound one other time in my life . When the creek was in flood and I was trying to cross on old Cato and we got swept downstream and he turned around and looked at me and screamed . They say a horse never screams like that unless he thinks he 's going to die . "  |p154One  would have thought she had not heard him . She had moved a little away and was regarding an Empire fauteuil , gravely , as if she were considering its purchase , and now she had stretched herself out on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was not looking at him . She had turned her head and was staring out of the low window . He walked over and stood beside her . " Why , Madame Recamier , do you think that will look good in your attic ? " She looked up then , smiling . " Do you ? " " No , " he said curtly . " None of this stuff suits you . Now why is that ? " " Maybe it 's because I 've never had an attic . " " But you must have had a salon of sorts . " " I told you that I was at home to students every Saturday afternoon for seven years , " she said indifferently . " Saturday afternoon ? Why were n't they off at football games ? " She shook her head . " Not Lester 's students . It gets cold out there around November . " " You mean they were n't red-blooded types ? Still , they were budding classicists and you 're no mean classicist yourself . Was n't there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday afternoons ? " She shook her head again . " I suppose there might have been  --  if I had wanted one . . . . But I did n't . " " What did you want ? " She gave her shoulders a faint shrug and laid her hand down on the faded , flowered satin that covered the fauteuil . " Aunt Margot had this in her boudoir . I used to think it was wonderful . Now I wonder why she had it . Nothing else there was Empire . " " Oh , somebody told her it was a good piece . The woman had no sense , no taste . Lived from one moment to the next  --  like all the Vincents . " He stared at her , frowning . " How did you really happen to come to Mio Sogno ? Was your mother ambitious for you ? " " She wanted me out of the way so she could pursue anp155much . Cynthia was telling me about some pictures of your father 's I 've never seen and we thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vera was not looking at him . She was staring at Cynthia . Her eyes slowly came back to his face . " There are no pictures of my father 's in that box , " she said . " No ? Cynthia said she helped you pack a bunch of them . " Vera silently shook her head , not looking at Cynthia . He took a step toward her . " Look here , Vera , " he said impatiently , " do n't get yourself out on a limb . I know what a rough time you had , but that 's all past . If there 's any of Carlo 's later stuff around it ought not to be stuck away in an attic . Think what it might mean to Max ! " " There 's not any of his stuff around , " she said in a low voice . " You mean that those pictures in that box are n't his ? Whose are they then ? " She clenched her hands at her sides . Tler eyes darted about the room then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she cried . " Mine ! Ca n't you understand how you might want to write something and not want anybody to see it ? " Claiborne crossed the room and put his arm about her shaking shoulders . " Forget it , darling . Of course we do n't want to see them if you do n't want us to . " She drew her breath in with a long sob . " I know it , " she said . A bell pealed below . " Come on , " he said , " let 's go to lunch , " and caught an arm of each woman and walked down the stairs . In the dining room there was conversation and laughter ; Max had paid a visit to the Hesses that morning and every visit he made them yielded at least one anecdote worth telling . Once or twice during the meal Claiborne glanced speculatively at his wife . Her color was higher than usual but she gave no other sign of disturbance as she turned from one to the other , smiling , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes ago , up in the attic , she hadp156averted her eyes from his while she contrived the first lie she had ever told him . He wondered why she had felt obliged to tell it . " It is a good place , is n't it ? " Vera said , and laying her hand on her husband 's arm , drew a little closer to him . Claiborne looked down at the little river that wound its sluggish way through the ravine . Its banks were lined with sycamores . Their shade would have been pleasant on a day like this , but Vera had made them cross the river on steppingstonesto climb to the top of this high , grassy bluff . She thought that the cave  --  visible from here only as a ledge of whitish rock covered with woodbine and some other trailing stuff  --  was more " exciting " viewed from this vantage point . He was forty-eight years old today , so they had driven five miles to these woods , to eat cold chicken and hothouse lettuceand hothouse tomatoes and hothouse grapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chablis or Soave out of paper cups . There had been a discussion about the kind of wine they would bring . It had ended in their bringing two kinds . The toasts were over . He could stand here on the edge of the bluff and eat his grapes and look down on the sluggish river . The rivers in this country are n't any good , he thought , not enough rock , and was aware that the soft pressure he had felt against his side was increasing ; Vera had joined him a few minutes ago . Involuntarily , he tightened the arm he had slipped about her waist . She was trying to say something to him with her body that she could n't say any other way . All day she had been trying to say it , by a pressure of the hand as he helped her over a slippery stone , by a look , a smile . What was it ? He had not gone to her room last night ; she had not comep157to his . He had been afraid that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for him was as yet undefined ; surely there had been anger in that look she had turned on him there in the attic yesterday . But whatever extraordinaryemotions she had harbored yesterday had disappeared  --  to make way for the emotions that must be harbored today . That was it . She and Max had chosen this spot  --  an open , grassy ring , surrounded by rocks and stunted oaks on top of a high bluff  --  as a place to be merry in on this day of Our Lord , nineteen hundred and forty-six , in the forty-eighth year of the earthly pilgrimage of Thomas Crenfew Claiborne , so merry we must be in the good green wood , heigh-ho ! That was what that look meant , that smile that was at once secret and sharing , radiant and diffident . Enjoy yourself , you son-of-a-bitch . Eat , drink and be merry  --  or I 'll cry ! " Does n't it remind you of your cave ? " Vera asked . He did not answer , watching Max and Cynthia walking toward them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow  --  or were those stripes buff-colored ? Indeed almost the same shade as the sage grass that she was treading under her feet . ( If you read off and on , half the night , night after night , year after year , the muscles of your eyes will cease vibrating to certain colors , or will , at least , vibrate at a different rate of speed . ) Max was carrying a thermos jug of wine . He let him fill his cup from it . Vera was waiting for him to say something . " Which cave ? " he asked . " The one you and George discovered . " George Crenfew used to go with him and his mother in the summers to the " springs " on the top of Long Mountain . The summer he was fourteen he and George had enjoyed considerable fame as the result of their discovery of a cave at the foot of the mountain . He would never forget how , swimmingon his back in the river , he had suddenly looked up into a tangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackness that was not rock . I was the first one who saw it , he thought , but George was the first man inside . Now how did that happen ? Aloud he said : " George and I have discov/ered more than one cave in our time . This cave reminds me more of Buzzard 's Cave than the one on Long Mountain . " " Where is Buzzard 's Cave ? " " Under water , " he said , " like everything else at Eupedon . . . . It was just a cave George and I found one afternoon . " He had taken his arm from about her waist to throw the stem from which he had stripped all the grapes down into the stream . There must have been something in his tone that offended her , or it might have been merely that he had removed his arm from about her waist  --  she was abnormally sensitive . At any rate , she had moved off without waiting to hear anything else he might have to say . But Cynthia Vail still stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see only the curve of her cheek but he knew that her eyes were following the dark naked stem as it swirled slowly downstream . If they were alone he would ask her what she made of that business in the attic yesterday . He said in a voice loud enough to carry to Vera 's ears if she were listening : " So called because full of buzzards . . . . George and I had quite a time with them . . . . Why is it that buzzards never come north of the Mason-Dixon Line ? " " Hell , " Max said , " I 've seen them flying over your house . " " Those are n't buzzards , " Claiborne said . " Those are George Crenfew 's patients flying home . . . . George has a buzzard fixation , so his patients take the form of buzzards . . . . Count Dracula 's used to impersonate bats . " She turned her head at that to give him her cool , secret smile . " I suppose George got his buzzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " From dissecting a buzzard we found lying up on a rock in Buzzard 's Cave . " " Was it dead ? " Max asked . " Rigor mortis had not set in , which made it easier for me and George to transport it  --  a whole mile , in a tow sack , as I recall . " " What did you do with it when you got it home ? " " I abandoned science about that time , but George wasp159staunch . He put it in the bottom of the old icehouse  --  that was the only place nobody ever went  --  and used to climb down at intervals to see it  --  till my mother told him it was time for his visit to be over . " " God , you 're morbid today ! " Max said . " It 's the cave , " Claiborne said . " Wakens primordial mem-ories . " " If we 're going to explore the cave we 'd better get going , " Max said . " Wait , Vera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic hamper . Cynthia went to help them . Claiborne sat down on a rock and drank off another cup of wine . They had finished with the hamper . Cynthia , straightening up , gave him an enigmaticglance and sat down on a nearby rock . Vera went on stooping about the grove , gathering up debris . He watched her stuff a newspaper into the sack she was carrying and speculated on how long it would have had to be exposed to the elements to become that sodden . She was collecting not only the waste from their own meal but from the meal somebody they had never seen or heard of had consumed in this grove weeks before . She had a proprietary feeling about this place . She and Max , rambling through these woods last January , had found the cave below and had chosen it for a picnic spot . They had even , on that day  --  under a sky that must have been dreary , if not lowering , surrounded by the wet , black trunks of these stunted oaks  --  marked the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth today 's viands : the cold carcass of the chicken not yet hatched , the eggs spiced but then not laid , the fruits whose seed at that time had not even been committed to the earth . . . . It had been a long time since anybody had said anything . His own voice still seemed to reverberate in the sunny air . " Primordial memories , " he said again . " They are stronger in me than in the rest of you . I come of a race of spelunkers . In my neighborhood everybody has a cave to retire to when things get too much for him . Why , I had one cousin spent practically his whole life in ap160cave . Cousin Fillinger Fayerlee . Had his bed set up in the mouth of the cave and used to sit there all day long . . . . " " Just could n't tear himself out of the womb ? " Max said , and took the bag that Vera had filled with waste and dropped it on some soot-blackened stones and bent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , blue and wavering and somehow liquid  --  as if a thin stream of water were being poured into the air . Somewhere there must be a place , a point at which all elements meet and fuse . Anaximenes held that the primary substance of the world was air , as did Diogenes of Apollonia after him . " The flame does not look the same way to the others that it does to you . That is because you are drunk , " the Voice said . " That 's why I get drunk  --  in order to see things like that . " The Voice did not reply . Those were the really frightening times , when the Voice would suddenlynot answer , would break off as if there were nothing more to be said . Better the interminable , the wearying colloquy , better anything than that ! " These obsessions are verystrong in the limestone regions of Kentucky , " he said . " I had another cousin fell in love with a corpse . . . . Here , I'llhave a swig of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to carry it down ? " Max asked . " Certainly . . . . Name was Hazel . She had shot seven men in Alabama and had become petrified by a process I never quite grasped . " " What else do you want to carry ? " Max said . " Anything . . . any little thing , " he said , looking at his wife , who stood staring dreamily at some twigs that had taken fire from the wastepaper and now glowed fiery red . She looked up as if aware of his scrutiny , then looked back at the embers . Suddenly she smiled . " When I was a child I used to worry about how peculiar my family was , " she said . " You know , people were always talking about the strange things my father did . . . . " And your mother , off with first one arty young man and then another , " Claiborne said.  | " Yes , " she said steadily . " My father and mother were consideredstrange , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about my family 's being strange . " " Back my family against anybody 's family , " Claiborne said . He got to his feet and was annoyed to find his legs unsteady under him . He must be drunker than he had thought . Odd how that was happening to him more and more frequently these days . . . . But they were not listening to him . They were staring at the overalled figure that was advancing toward them through the dappled shade of the sycamores . " It 's Tom Abel , " Vera said . " Something must be wrong . " " Not necessarily , " Max said . But she was already off down the path and across the stream . Max had followed her . Cynthia was picking up some of the small objects they had left behind . He waited and gave her a hand across the steppingstones . Up on the bank he could hear his wife 's excited voice and the dairyman 's more measured tones . " It 's Bud , Mrs. Claiborne . " " Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . " " Oh , please ! Has he hurt anybody ? " Claiborne came up the path in time to see the slow grin on Tom Abel 's face . " He 's hurt Miss Minta Hess 's feelings . " Claiborne went up to them . " What 's he done ? " he asked roughly . Abel took the grin off his face . " He jumped the fence into the Hess pasture , Mr. Claiborne . " " Where those hot heifers are , " Max said . " God , I knew it would happen ! " " Did it happen ? " Vera askedAbel nodded slowly . " Yes 'm . . . She maintains that Dewberryand Blossie ai n't no better'n beef cattle now . She maintainsthat they wo n't bring more'n one hundred and twentydollars apiece now , whereas yesterday they was worth threehundred apiece . They was Holstein heifers , Mrs. Claiborne . " " What does she mean , talking like that ? " Claiborne asked  | " She 's got a lawyer , " Abel said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd come over here and tell Mrs. Claiborne . . . . " " Vera , the Hesses have been waiting for something like this , " Max said . " Ever since you started raising Red Polls . " " Oh , no ! " Vera said . " They 're crazy about Dewberry , and Blossie too . " She was pale and actually trembling all over , but she had a look about her mouth that he had come to know , the look that meant that her mind was made up and that nothing you could say would change it . She would never recognize the maneuver as a scheme by which two poor people and a shyster lawyer could extract money from a simple-minded rich woman , but would dance to any tune they called , going about for the next few weeks asking herselfand anybody who would listen to her what was right and what was wrong . He gave a short laugh . " These paternity cases are always best settled out of court . " " The poor brute could n't hep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Claiborne said . " Bud 's quite stubborn , as you 'll find if you ever have occasion to cross him . I think he ought to see George Crenfew . I had a long talk with him the other day and pointed out to him that it was all up with natural mating . But he could n't see it . I bet he was planning this coup then . " Vera gave him a swift glance . " You told us all about that the other night , " she said in a strained , harsh voice . " Do you have to go over it all again ? " " No , " he said , and felt a foolish smile arrange itself on his face , " I just thought . . . " " Suppose you stop talking for a few minutes , old fellow , " Max said quietly . He turned to Vera . " There 's no use in breaking up the party . If you want me to I 'll go on to the house and make a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him tomorrow . " " Oh , no ! " Vera said . " There is n't any party  --  now . I 'm going with you , Max. "  | " What about it , Cynthia ? " Max was asking . " You want to go with us or stay with Tom ? " Tom ! They spoke of him in the third person , as one speaks of idiots or children . " Whatever you say , " Cynthia had said . But a look had passed between her and Max . They wanted her to detain him here while they talked to the lawyer  --  about what ? About a bull raping a heifer . . . . But what are bulls  --  and heifers  --  for ? They were moving off through the grove . Cynthia was walking off too , in the opposite direction , along a narrow , wavering path that somebody 's feet had bitten into the packed , white soil of the riverbank . This stream must flood every spring ; there was no vegetation on either bank for a dozen yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard that nothing ever grew in it again . Those stripes in her dress looked tawny in the light filtered through yellowing leaves . Sycamore leaves always turned early and were the first to fall . If she kept on going he would be alone in this grove , from which all but him had departed  --  on a fool 's errand , but gone nevertheless . " Where are you going ? " he called . She turned around , smiling . " To the cave . We were brought here to see the cave , were n't we ? " " Certainly , " he said , " it was my birthday treat , " and ran a few steps and caught up with her . He could see the cave ahead of them . It seemed larger than when he had looked down on it from the bluff . The entrance was wide but shallow . A great , black hole yawned back of it : the " room " Vera had talked about . He pushed a hanging mat of woodbine aside and stood with her under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaly but dry and warm from the September sun . From behind the curtain of trailingvines , he stared out at the grove . Not as many leaves had fallen as he had thought . The look  --  and the feel  --  were still of summer . There was a rustle among the drying ferns . She had gonep164over to peer down into the black hole . She said that she could hear water dripping . " These caves up here do n't make good stalactites , " he said without turning around . There was a faint sound , as of a stone being dislodged . She had stepped down over the threshold and was standing in the dark " room . " " It 's quite dry , " she called . " I told you it was n't a real cave . " " But there is another passage . . . . How far do you supposeit goes ? " " Not far . . . . Would you like to explore it ? " " That 's what we came here for , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 've got all day . . . . Why do n't you sit down ? " As if obedient to his command , she came and sat down on a rock opposite him . " Why would n't Vera let us see those pictures the other day ? " he asked . " I do n't think I ought to tell you that . " " Why ? " " Because . . . " " Because I 'm her husband  --  and you 're her cousin ? " She was silent a moment , then she said , " I 've never felt very close to Vera . " " No ? " he said . " Well , I can see how that might be . What I want to know is , what are those pictures of Carlo 's like ? " He felt his brain clear itself of the fumes of wine as if suddenlyaffected by some more powerful potion . She looked intently into his face and then , as if she too had had a moment of illumination or had , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are self-portraits , " she said . " In the nude , or mostly in the nude . Sometimes he wears chain armor , sometimes a plumed hat . . . . In one he 's St. George fighting the dragon . . . naked . " He brought his fist down on his knee . " Mad as a hatter ! I 've always known it . . . . How long did this go on ? "  | " From the time they went to live at Mio Sogno , I should think . " He laughed . " People thought he had retired from the world to do something that never had been done before  --  and all he was doing was looking in the mirror ! " " And painting what he saw . He worked . " He shook his head . " Poor devil ! It must have been a pretty sight . " " The pictures were  --  dreadful . " " How ? " " The color was  --  ugly . " " And the form ?

I think  --  from something Vera said once  --  that he had a theory that he was recapitulating the history of painting . " " Poor Vera ! " he said . " The wonder is that she wants to hang on to the things . " She was silent , so long that he looked at her questioningly . She said then : " Is n't that half the trouble ? " " The trouble ? " " Her trouble ? " " Well , what is her trouble ? " " Do n't you think that her uncritical attachment to her family may be part of it ? " " I never thought of that , " he said . " I always knew the whole setup was crazy , but I never thought of that .

" They were silent . She still sat on the rock on which she had dropped down at his bidding , her head a little bent , her hands in her lap . He had a feeling that she could sit there a long time without saying anything , without even lookingp166up . He studied the bent head , the long , rather thin hands , wondering how he could ever have thought of her as a negligible person . " Is Robin Vincent in love with you ? " he asked abruptly . " Robin ? " " Yes . Is n't he smitten with you ? " Her hand moved in an indifferent gesture . " I really do n't know . " " You have n't given it a thought ? " She slowly shook her head . " He 's not the most exciting company in the world , but he 's rich . " She looked up then . She laughed . After a second he laughed too . Het- lips were moving . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; he could not take his eyes from her green eyes and her pale face , flecked with light and shade from the trailing vines . It was not her face . It was her voice ! Surely that dry , metallic voice had echoed all his life in some dark crevice of his brain , a wind whirring dead leaves , dead branches of trees standing in rows on the banks of a river that ran far underground . . . . The man was not standing on the bank . He was plunged deep in the current . The mist that hung low over the river was lifting . He could see the cavern yawning . The waves that caressed his limbs ran before him like swallows as he swam for the wide , brightly lighted ledge . . . . He had frightened the girl , cool customer that she was . She was on her feet . There was an expression on her face he had never seen before . She looked first to one side of her , then to the other , repeated words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He set his hand on her shoulder . " Not yet , " he said , and drew her , stumbling , over the stone threshold , to lie beside him on the earthen floor where a moment ago she had stood alone.  |p167During  the next few weeks Claiborne busied himself with editing a symposium on contemporary letters for Spectra . The project was one he had undertaken several years before and had subsequently abandoned . Bob Waite had been surprised and pleased when Claiborne told him of his desire to undertake the symposium again . They had lunched together several times in order to discuss it and it had been agreed that Claiborne would try to have the contributions ready for the spring issue of Spectra . " I might make it , at that , " Claiborne said to himself as he went swiftly down the stairs one morning in late October , relieved to have surmounted what he had come to think of as the hurdle set at the beginning of each of his days . He had somehow to account for the tifne that he was more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera 's room immediately after breakfastto tell her that he would lunch with Bob and go on to a cocktail party Bob wanted him to show up at . She was in her bathroom , with the door closed , and called to him that she would be with him in a few minutes . Standing there , staring at the white door from behind which came the sound of rushing water , he had felt so great a disinclination to confront her , to exchange the kiss with which they were accustomed to mark so much as an hour 's parting , that he had shouted that he had not time to wait and had left the room hardly hearing what it was she had called out in answer . He had expected that she would go to the stable or out into the fields , as she usually did at this time of day , and was disconcerted when he came out of the house on the way to the garage to find her crouching beside the walk , underp168the great beech tree that spread its branches over the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass . She was hulling the nuts in the old-fashioned way , laying each nut on a flat stone and beating the hull off with a hammer . As he passed close beside her , she suddenly held one of the walnuts up . " Smell ! " she said . Obediently , he bent his head , then straightened up , his nostrils stinging with the odor that in boyhood had been so familiar . In the fall , at Eupedon , the walnuts from the three great trees that stood beside the smokehouse were gathered as they fell and heaped up in the brick runway between the kitchen and the old outkitchen . His father liked to sit in a low , split-bottom chair beside the heap and hull the nuts with a hammer , just as Vera was doing now . He himself , when he passed that way , would sometimes stop and pick one of the nuts up and hold it to his nose and inhale the smell that the greenish-yellow rind gave off , marveling each time , to find it at once so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading his mind , would look up , smiling . " Smells like fall , " he would say . " I always think walnuts smell more like fall than anything . " " Wa'nuts , " he said , like a Virginian , though he had been born in Tennessee . " Did you see Aunt Virginia ? " Vera asked . " God , no ! " he said , annoyed to recall that she had asked him to go in to see his aunt before he left . " I did tell you , " she said in an even tone . " I 'll miss my train . " She threw the wet , black nut into the basket that stood beside her and took another one up from the heap . " The ten forty-five gets into New York at eleven-forty , " she said . " I was going to stop at Shulte 's . They 've found a copy of Flanders Dunbar 's book on Dante for me . " She did not answer . " Did Aunt Virginia want anything special ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She wants to know who Cousinp169Tom Crenfew 's youngest son married . The one who went west . " " He married a chambermaid in St. Louis . " " She wants to know the name of the chambermaid . " " Do we have to have a family conference about that ? Adele . . . Adele B. Bristow . . . B for Bertha . " She laid her hammer down and crossed her blunt , little yellow-stained fingers in her lap . " She 's your aunt . . . . And it 's your project . " " Have it your own way , " he said , and left her and went into the house . As he went he recalled how pleased he and Vera had both been a year ago , when , in response to her repeatedpleas , he had thought of a diversion for his aunt : a family history in the shape of a memoir , in which the writer would not attempt to give any form to her memories , but would merely set down every day anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family connection as far back as hearsay or memory could reach . George Crenfew , who admired the scheme for its ingenious use of free association , called it the " Old Folks Project " and maintained that the government ought to subsidize it . This time last year they sometimes used to gather in Aunt Virginia'sroom and one of them would read aloud a chapter she had just finished , a chapter to which after they went downstairs Max would add a sequel  --  if he got drunk enough . She was expecting him , propped high on her pillows . He did not give her a chance to tell him what she wanted  --  sometimes it took her several minutes to tell you what you already knew she had it in mind to say . Standing just inside the door , he said : " **52;9378;TOOLONG Anythingdoforyou **50;9432;TOOLONG . " She bent a bewildered gaze on him . " Why , I know her name , Tom . Octavia .

" It is n't funny , " she said sadly . " Mother had a letter from Cousin Rachel , telling of a visit this poor Anna made to them after John 's death . She told Cousin Octavia that he was the finest gentleman she had ever known . " " And all he ever did was drink and gamble . . . .

" I was thinking about something that happened in December . Two days after his birthday  --  he was born on December twenty-second , you know . . . . " I know , " he said hastily . " Made it hard for him . Presents and all that . " " I never knew until this morning what really happened , " she said . " I was lying here thinking about them all and all of a sudden it all came together in my mind . I do n't know why I never realized it before . " " What was it , Aunt Virginia ? " he said patiently .

Do you remember those back stairs at Eupedon , Tom ? " " God , yes ! " " I wish you would n't be profane , Tom . . . . It 's vulgar ! " " All right , " he said . " He came by and found you crying ... " And he went away . " She sat up straight against her pillowsto give him a sudden brilliant smile . " I never knew until this morning where he went . " " Where did he go ? " " He got on his horse and rode through the storm , all the way to Sycamore , to get me a doll . . . . He must have got it there . Anyhow , that was how I found out about Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of the same stuff as a ball dress Cousin Virginia Crenfew had . . . . But was n't that kind , Tom ? " " Yes , " he said absently . " He was always very kind  --  to childrenand niggers . Specially kind to children and niggers . " " The servants adored him , " she said . " Yes . . . yes . . . they did that , all right . " He glanced at his watch . " Aunt Virginia , I 've got to go . " The brown eyes , which no matter how hard she tried to die , kept on glowing in her pallid face , glowed brighter , becameluminous . It was the look he dreaded . There was only one way to put an end to that . He crossed the room and bent and set his lips on her forehead . " Good-bye , Aunt Virginia . Now you take care of yourself . " But she had put her hand up . The thin , chill fingers were closing on his wrist . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance on him again . " Tom , " she said in her reedy voice , " do you ever think that we two are all that is left ? " He eased himself back on his heels . " Of the family ? Why , Aunt Virginia , the woods down home are full of Claibornes . " Her hand fell away from his arm . She turned her headtoward the window . " Not even the place ! " she whispered . " Ilie here and think how the place is n't even there any longer . The trees , Tom ! The wa'nut trees and the big elm that camep172from a riding switch your grandfather stuck in the ground . Nobody can even see them now . . . . All under water . . . all under water . . . " " I wish we had n't sold the place , " he said after a moment . " I wish now we had n't sold the place . " " You could n't help it , " she said wearily . " None of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " There was nothing else to do . . . . I could n't live there , and you would n't want to live there alone . " " No , " she whispered . " We could n't live there . We could n't any of us live there any more . But we did live there , Tom . After all , it 's something to be a Claiborne . I hope you 'll never . forget that , Tom . " He laughed . " I 'm not likely to forget it , " he said , and beforeshe could answer bent and kissed her again . " I 've got to go . Now you take care of yourself , Aunt Virginia . " He was at the door when a sound made him turn around . Her head was drooping sidewise against her pillow . The sound he had heard was a whimper that might have come from a child . Reluctantly he turned back to stand beside the bed . " What is it , Aunt Virginia ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom , you would n't leave me here with strangers ? " " Strangers ? " he said roughly . " Do you call Vera and Max strangers ? " Her head turned on its long neck . She opened her eyes and fixed them on his face . He stood for a second , taking full the gaze he had always known she would one day turn on him , before he went silently from the room.  |p173Vera  was still sitting on the ground under the beech tree , hulling walnuts . Max had come to sit on the marble bench above her . He asked Claiborne what train he intended to take home that evening . Claiborne replied that he hoped to make the nine forty-five . " Not if I know the Waites , " Max said . Claiborne gave him a straight look . " Why do n't you come along ? " Max shook his head . " The country is too good to leave right now . Did you know there 'd been a frost ? Very light frost . Sparkling all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What were you doing at I-Iesses ' ? " " Calling on the little mothers , " Max said airily . Vera and Max had been in conference with the Hesses and two lawyers yesterday afternoon . Vera 's lawyers had proposed that she buy Dewberry and Blossie for the price they would have brought before they were bred , but Minta Hess had showed herself unexpectedly sentimental , refusing to part with Dewberry and Blossie at any price that the lawyer would allow Vera to offer . It had therefore been decided that the heifers should remain in the possession of the Hesses but that Vera should have the privilege of buying the calves if any were dropped . " How are the little mothers ? " Claiborne asked now . " Rounding out nicely , " Max said . " Looks to me like Dewberrymay get there first . " " How much are you going to pay the Hesses ? " Claiborne asked . Vera did not answer . After a moment Max said , " Three hundred apiece . "  |p174Claiborne  let out a whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape , " he said , staring at the nape of his wife 's bent neck where a few white hairs glistened among the black hairs that curled there . Abruptly he went over and planted a kiss on the crown of her head then started for the garage . Max got up and walked beside him . " You going to have lunch with Bob ? " he asked . " Likely to , " Claiborne said . " Then I guess you 'll see Cynthia . . . . How 's she getting along ? " Claiborne turned his head to give him a straight glance . " Do you mean with the job or in general ? " " With the job . I think you could trust her to take care of herself  --  in general . Pretty smart cookie , that girl , getting the Spectra job just like that ! " " I 'll try to see her at lunchtime , " Claiborne said , " to find out how she 's getting along with the job . After all , I recommendedher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide door sliding upward , then got into his car . Max was still standing in the middle of the doorway through which the car had to pass . He was staring at a clump of larkspur that thrust up through the gravel . At the sound of the motor he looked up . " You really coming home tonight ? " he asked . Claiborne leaned out . " I 'm going to stay at the Hotel Hibiscus , " he said . " You remember it , do n't you ? " He paused and looked straight into the shining black eyes . " You might give me a ring . " Max looked away , stepped off the drive . Claiborne did not look at him again as he backed the car out and turned around but the image of the black , shining glance which had been so abruptly veiled stayed with him till he reached the highway . Home ! he thought . Home ! Home is where the heart is , but the heart , nowadays , is on the run . Reposing nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is ap175question whether they are functional ) , it has time to surround itself with flesh , provide itself with livers , lungs , and lights , but once out of the womb there is no opportunity to acquire those other fleshly integuments that were once so dear . And yet how stubborn the human heart ! Eupedon had long been under water : the house , the outbuildings , the old orchard , the garden , the tall trees that stood about the house , were all fathoms deep under water , and she lay here , thinking about musty portieres in the back hall of a house that no longer existed and a boy who no longer had human shape riding along a road whose particles were no longer dust to fetch a doll for a child who would have been better off if she had died that Christmas Eve ! As the car went down the public road he wondered how the two he had left would spend the rest of the day . Hulling walnuts that would never be used and storing them in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's herbs to powder in a mortar ? They had a whole outfit for such work , including an ingenious little threshing machine that Max had rigged up . Whatever it was they would go at it conscientiously , with childlike absorption . No pains were too great to achieve the inconsequential results which they duly reported each time the family gathered at a meal . . . . Family ? Did a half-crazy man , a childish woman , and a fortyfive-year-oldsexual deviate constitute a family ? And if so , whose was the leading role in the triumvirate ? Was not Max actually the prop and stay of the house ? That was the role he had more and more assumed during the last few weeks . It was Max , not he , who had advised Vera throughout the altercationwith the Hesses over the heifers . She had hardly mention edit to him and it was Max who had just briefly informed him of the decision that had been arrived at . She was not a woman who liked to make decisions by herself . This was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , she would have called it  --  without consulting him . IIe concludedp176that she must have been offended by the offhand attitude he had taken from the first toward the affair . God knows what he had said over there on the bluff , but she knew he was tight . She ought not to have been offended . But she took offense easily . She was , in some ways , the most sensitive person he had ever known . It was as if all her daily activities , her intercourse with her husband , her family , her friends , were films that the flesh had grown over some deep wound . He and she , he supposed , had " fallen in love at first sight , " meeting , in that allee of sycamores , like pilgrims bent on the same mad quest . The first words they had addressed to each other were the phrases that intimates might exchange on being reunited , not the greetings that pass between strangers . Three weeks after they met they had become lovers . He had been delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened by her assumption that he had powers that he had never thought of himself as possessing . ( " You 're not crazy ! " " No , not now . Not now ! " ) She had come to him as to a physician  --  or magician . He was to give her everything she had ever wanted and never got . When she found that he could not do it ( what man could ? ) she had turned away from him ( for she could not deny that in the last few years she had turned away from him ! ) to lose herself in frenetic activity . Pales , Pomona , even the noble Ceres become the playthingof a woman and a half-man , for Max abetted her in all she did . . . . But the wound still bled ! Often , in his arms , which she had once held a sovereign refuge , she would weep for no apparent reason , or on a moonlight night pace that balcony outside her window . " I ca n't stand it . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our life . " " Our lives ? " " No , I mean our life . " " I thought that this was the way you wanted to live . " " I did n't know it would be like this . . . . " But she couldp177never tell you what " this " was , or what she wanted life to be like . He arrived at the station just in time to park his car and swing aboard the train . The smoker was crowded , but he found a seat halfway up the aisle , beside a woman . He had been sitting beside her for several minutes before she leaned forward to look up into his face . " Hello , Marcia ! " he said , startled . Marcia Crenfew laughed mischievously . " Did you get it figured out ? " she asked . " Get what figured out ? " " The problem you were working on . It must be difficult , from the way you were gritting your teeth . " " I 'm doing a piece for Spectra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said after a moment . " I did n't know you ever bothered with deadlines and that sort of thing . " " Oh , I toil not , 2teither do I spin , but I do occasionally take a little thought , " he said in what he hoped was a cheerfultone . " I took thought all night long , " she said with a sigh , " and this morning I told George I was going in to town and have a talk with that woman . It seems to me the only thing to do . " " What woman ? " " Catherine Pollard . Did n't Vera tell you ? Dessy 's been at her place for three weeks now . They 've put Dessy in charge of the clothes room . " " The clothes room ? " he repeated vaguely . " The room where they pile up all the old clothes that people give them . My God , I positively defrauded myself , and Katie and Desiree and George too , when Catherine spent that week end with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems to me that if you give them the things they ought at least to sew the buttons on themselves . " " So Desiree sews the buttons on , " he said vaguely , wondering whether Cynthia would be at her apartment on Bedfordp178Street when he got there . Last Saturday he had gone by the office to pick her up but she had told him that she did not think he ought to do that again . And she was right . Bob Waite was no fool . In fact , he was better than the next man at putting two and two  --  or one and one  --  together . And as the devil 's luck would have it Alma had been there that day . . . . He remembered the blow it had been to her when he resignedfrom Spectra , perhaps because she was shrewder than Bob and knew Bob 's limitations better than Bob , himself . Her face had actually gone white when she heard the news . " Are you sure you 're doing the right thing , Tom ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just from Bob 's standpoint . It 'll be hard for him to carry on by himself , but it can be done . But what about you ? What 'll become of you ? " He had tried to carry it off lightly . " What 's going to becomeof any of us , Alma ? The Lord is the only one knows about that . " The remark had infuriated her . She had suddenly thrust her face up close to his . " Do n't you worry about Bob , " she had hissed . " Bob 'll get along . But you 'll rot out there , doing nothing all day long . Mark my words : you 'll rot ! " There had been a coolness between him and Alma from i that time forward . . . . But that was a long time ago . Twelve years ago . Why was he thinking of all that now when he had so much else to think of ? It was because he had run into Alma at the Spectra office the other day . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter had put him on his guard , making him realize that from now on he would have to concern himself more with appearance than he ever had before . From now on he would have to watch his step . For how long ? . . a blue denim skirt and a scarf tied over their heads and sneakers , " Marcia said . " They do n't even have a regular habit ! " " Who is it dresses like that ? " he asked  | " Dessy , Tom . She wants to live at Catherine 's place and go around dressed the way those people dress . " " What people ? " " Those Catholic Laborers of Catherine 's . It 's a kind of third order , Tom . Daughters of Charity or something like that  --  because that 's where Catherine went when she left George . " " When she left George ? " he echoed stupidly . " Tom , you remember how she walked out on him . And nobody had any idea where she was  --  least of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a convent in the Faubourg St. Antoine , washing dishes and scrubbing floors or something . . . . That strikes Desiree and the rest of those girls as the height of romance ! " " Is she corrupting many young girls ? " he asked . " There 's a girl left Leonard soon after the term began . Her parents ca n't get her to go back to college . She says it 's just too dull . . eorge thinks that we ought to leave Dessy alone , that she 'll get tired of it eventually , but I do n't know . Catherine has an extraordinary influence over her . " " So you 're going down this morning to combat her dread influence ? " She nodded . " I 'm going down to have a talk with Catherine . I want to see exactly what problems are involved . I told George we ca n't act intelligently unless we know exactly what problems are involved . " She settled herself a little more firmly on the plush-covered seat , as if she felt herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " problem . " How promptly , he thought , she would set herself to solve his " problem " if she only knew of its existence ! His " problem " and its " comp ications . " A sigh escaped him . It was only three weeks since that picnic on the creek banks . In the last three weeks his life had undergone such a change that he was still dizzy with thinking of it . He had regarded what had happened that day as a regrettable incident and had been prepared to express his regret to Cynthia when they met the next day , and was some/what taken aback by the frankness and promptness with which she faced the consequences of that act . She would have to cut her visit short , she said , and take possession of the apartment she had rented in New York sooner than she had intended . " Wo n't Vera 's feelings be hurt if you cut your visit short ? " he had asked . He would not soon forget the look she had given him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is necessary . Can I ? " " I suppose not , " he had had to answer . Three nights ago he had almost missed the last train back to the Valley , lingering with his mistress ( he had a mistress now ! ) till eleven o'clock on the little terrace at the back of her apartment . There was a tree in the courtyard below whose branches pushed up against the terrace and shaded it from the glare of the neighbors ' windows . An ailanthus , of course . If you have only one tree you think more of it than a hundred stately oaks . The apartment consisted of one large , square room , with a small bedroom off one side of it and the conveniences off the other . He felt more at home there than in his own handsome , well-appointed house and he never left it without a pang . He had told her so the other night . " It 's envy , " she said . " I 'm leading the kind of life you 'd like to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How do you know the kind of life I ought to be lead-ing ? " " Do you remember the day I brought those Ausonius translationsto your study ? " she asked . He could see himself standing there , listening to the knock and grinning , only now it was as if she were standing there beside him . On the same side of the door . She was on the same side of the door now . She did not have to exert herself to read his thoughts . She knew his thoughts because they were her thoughts . " You have a diabolical intelligence , " he said . " Is that the secret of your charm ? " " I aim to please , " she said , with her faint smile that was smothered when he caught her in his arms.  |p181Later  , still smiling  --  for he had just told her how much she pleased him  --  she had said that they must take thought about their situation . " I know , " he said , and groaned and put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands away from his face and held them in her own while she told him that she could not see that there was anything to groan about . " I take it you 're no longer in love with your wife , " she said . " No . I have n't been for a long time . " " But you do n't want a divorce ? " " I had n't thought that far , " he said , startled . " I do n't see why you should  --  at present , " she returned calmly . When he said that he did not like to see her placed in a compromising position she had laughed . " How horse and buggy can you get , darling ? Do n't you realize that if we 're seen together in public it 's more of a help to me than a hindrance ? " " I have to consider Vera , " he said . She was silent at that ; then : " We both have to consider Vera . Do you feel that we have taken anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and groaned again . " I have n't had anything to give her  --  for a long time . . . . " Then stay with me  --  while you can , " she said . " That 's all I ask . Come to me when you can and stay as long as you can . " Later , lying side by side on long garden chairs on the tiny terrace , they had talked about the days when they had first known each other . She was such a remarkable woman , so free from ordinary female vanity that he could confess to her that in the old days at Mio Sogno he had hardly remarked her presence . He could summon up only the impression of a small , slight young person slipping in and out of rooms . She smiled dryly at that . " I tried to make myself useful . Is n't that what 's expected of poor relations ? " " Did you feel yourself so much the poor relation ? " " No , " she said slowly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if somebody had opened a window before me  --  a showcase window containing all sorts of wonderfulobjects . Some of them things I 'd never seen before . I was trying to find out what they all were . . . . But I knew , too , that there was something wrong . . . . " " You mean that you knew all along that Carlo Vincent was crazy ? " he asked . Cynthia said that the idea had occurred to her the summer she had first visited the Vincents . At that time Vincent 's seclusion was not complete . He had come into the dining room straight from the studio one night , staring-eyed , unshaved , in a ragged old jacket , and had stood in the doorwaylong enough to intone some Latin phrases and then had gone away . " Margot said , He 's drunk again , ' but Vera said , He 's not drunk , Mummy ! ' and got up and went after him . The next day we were walking in the garden near the belvedere and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pictures and Vera said no , that he did not like people to see his pictures . But why does he paint them then ? ' I asked , and she said she did n't know and began to cry . She cried a lot that summer . " " But she never told you why she was crying ? " " No . I think her relationship to her family was very  --  unusual , so unusual that she would n't dare discuss it with anybody else . At least , she did n't then . Perhaps she does now  --  with you . " He did not reveal to her how illuminating that remark had been . he had not realized until then that he and Vera had had for years a tacit agreement not to talk about her . family . They might spend hours rehearsing the eccentricities of the Claiborne-Crenfew tribes . There was nothing he liked better than discussing the differences between the two branches of the Claiborne family , the " Kinky Heads " and the " Anyhows . " The " Kinky Heads " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had been abolitionists . Old Crenfew Claiborne , for instance , had abandoned the culturep183of tobacco and planted his land with mulberry trees to feed silkworms , after shipping all his slaves to Africa . Fauntleroy Claiborne , an " Anyhow , " had never worn shoes after he got out of the Confederate army and slept with all the money he had in a roll under his pillow . Vera 's great-grandfather Clancy  --  he later made money in steel  --  had landed in this country just in time for the Civil War . He had been a sutler for the Union army . That was about all she knew about his early life . In her family so few anecdotes had survived that you could not even tell which of her immediate ancestors she resembled . Had she perhaps got her stubbornness from her Irish forebears , her simplicity from the Italian side of her family ? In the past few weeks he had known a peculiar pleasure in pondering and discussing certain aspects of Vera 's character . Seeing a person through another person 's eyes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the room in which he had thought himself alone . The pleasure was doubtless perverse as well as peculiar . He had never before discussed his wife 's character with any human being ; they had been too close  --  perhaps they had been too close !  --  for that . But then he had never before met anybody who seemed to know her better than she knew herself , or than he knew her . It was as if a torch  --  or a searchlight  --  were suddenlyplaying on a path along which he had been stumbling in the dark . But not alone ! Vera moved ahead of him on that same path . What could he do but follow ? It was not on Vera alone that the light played . It was the Vincent family as a whole that had engaged the attention of this remarkable girl for two whole summers , as she admitted , half laughing . She seemed never to have taken them for granted , but always , from the time of her first visit , to have walked about among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself about them , the questions she asked of them , were not the questions that anybody else would have asked . People said negligently that Margot had had probably more than a touch of nymphomania , that Carlo ,  |p184for  all his genius , was doubtless a " true alcoholic , basically homosexual . " Not for her such easy dismissals . It was as if she  --  and he too , for he had joined her on her strange quest  --  wandered in some vast cavern underground , their only light the torch which played now on this marmoreal figure , now on that , figures whose pose , whose features seemed at first glance familiar but which in the gleam of the torch held up in her frail hand , would suddenly lean forward in an attitude never assumed in life , emit from under shadowy brows looks never leveled on fellow mortals . He had begun to dream about the place , which gave it more the aspect of reality , made it more like a place he had actually visited , or , perhaps , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conscientious curator , he added to his collection from time to time . The acquisition of a figure was the occasion of one of those intervals in which , again like the conscientious collector of works of art , he stood before his statue , pleading with it to reveal itself to him in its essence . Carlo was the strangest of all his acquisitions . Carlo would not consent to that silent communion in which it was nearly always possible to engage the others . Carlo  --  and this was the strangest thing of all  --  Carlo was not always to be found on the same pedestal , or even in the vast hall . In a dream he had had recently , Carlo was running down a winding corridor that opened off the hall , the rags of his worn jacket fluttering in a wind that seemed to beat up from regions colder and more infernal than any the dreamer had ever envisioned . There was somebody running beside Carlo . Who was it ? He took a fine linen handkerchief out of his breast pocket and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you can , " she said , and , then , like any other woman , began estimating the duration of that stay . The other night as he was going out into the street she had followed him down the stairs to say good-by again , " because you may not come back . " " There is nobody who can keep me from coming back , " hep185told her . " Not even Vera ? " " Not even Vera . " He had not hesitated when he said that , and indeed , he felt in him a power for decision , for action he had never felt before . He had spent his life in aimless walking to and fro on the earth 's surface , but a man must know , in the end , what it is he stands on . Saul goes to the Witch of Endor , Odysseus descends to Orcus , and Tiresias at his request spills the bullock 's blood and summons the shades . The past twelve years had gone over his head as unmarked as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificent trees on his richly nourished lawn . But the time had come for the sleeper to rouse himself , to leave the light summer air , even if it meant descending into the vaporous and shadowy underground . He clenched his hand on his knees . " I was a poet once , " he thought , " and by God I 'll be one again ! " The woman sitting beside him on the train started . " You do n't have to read it if you do n't want to , but I thought that since it was you who sggested it . . . " I suggested it ? " he repeated , trying to keep his voice even . Marcia gave him a curious glance . " Tom , you know you told me to investigate Baudelaire . You said I might be sur-prised . " " And were you ? " " Oh , of course I read Les Fleurs du Mal in college . But reading it now is a very different experience . I had no idea there was so much material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've decided to concentrate on that . " " Are you going to write something about it ? " he asked . She laughed excitedly . " Do n't you think that the very sound of excretion may have evoked the feeling of loathing he had for the sexual act ? " " The sound of excretion . . . ? " " It 's obvious that he must have seen his mother and his stepfather in coitus at some time . " He said absently : " In coitu. "  | " Oh , Tom ! What I mean is he must have , or he would n't have such a horror of the sexual act . Listen , " and she began quoting : " Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades , C'etait un palais infini , Plein de bassins et de cascades Tombant dans 1'or mat ou bruni . . . What do you make of that ? The color alone ought to tell you . " " The color ? " " Or . . . gold . . . . Urine is yellow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  unless a person has some kidney disease . " She laughed merrily : " Et des cataractes pesantes , Comme des rideaux de cristal , Se suspendaient , eblouissantes , A des murailles de metal ... . " What of it ? " he said . She said meaningfully : " Non d'arbres , mais de colonnades Les etangs dormant s'entouraient , Oil de gigantesques naiades , Comme des femmes , se miraient . Oh , Tom , ca n't you see the way the woman 's legs would look like mighty columns to a child of three or four ? And the fountains and cascades that fall in gold . . . . Of course it was probably china but a vitreous china would look like metal to a tiny boy , and of course every child loves . . . " To look into a chamberpot full of urine , " he said . " The poem , then , is a vision of Baudelaire 's mother sitting on a chamberpot . " " Well , I think he must have seen her like that some time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the little boy gets his innings later on in the poem . After all , he has a penis , andp187his mother , even if she is a giantess , does n't have a penis . . . . " " PENNSYLVANIA STATION . . . PENNsylvania Station , " a voice said . She rose . Claiborne got to his feet too , and stood looking down on her . " God , you are one lucky woman ! " he said . She colored . " Oh , I know how you feel about psychiatry , Tom . I did n't expect you to agree with me . " " It 's not the way I feel about psychiatry , " he said . " It 's the way I feel about poetry . . . . I was thinking what I 'd do with you if you were my wife . " She tilted her round chin . " Is n't it fortunate for both of us that I 'm not ? " He continued to stare down at her . " If you were my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crap drained out of you  --  if it took the rest of your life . " Her face was crimson now . " Since you ca n't do that maybe you 'll let me pass . I 've got a good deal to do today . " He started , lifted his brief case , and made for the door , so hastily and determinedly that he had not time to look back and so was not aware of the sudden sharp glance that she sent after him out of eyes bright with anger . THIRTEENVera always began her Christmas preparations in October . They were formidable . The legal firm which handled the Vincent estate contributed considerable sums to various charitiesat this season , but Vera never seemed to feel that the money came out of her own pocket . She referred to these disbursements as " that money of Mr. Elliott 's . " She herself bought Christmas presents the year around  --  whenever she came across or thought of the present she considered suitablep188for any person on her list , which ranged from the members of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a whole room on the second floor of the house given over throughout the year to presents . But it seemed that more presents must be bought . One Saturday in October she announced that she would go in to town to do " some serious shopping . " Max said that he would accompany her . Claiborne had already announced that he was going in to town that day . The three boarded the nine fifty-five train together . Max wanted to buy some phonograph records . They decided to go first to a book and record shop on lower Fifth Avenue . " You 'll have time to go with us , wo n't you , Tom ? " Vera asked . Claiborne had told her that he was lunching with Bill Trowbridge at one o'clock but he had not mentionedany other engagement . It seemed to him that he had no other choice but to accompany them . Max could not make up his mind whether he wanted Frescobaldi or Mozart . When he put the Frescobaldi on for the second time Claiborneleft the room and wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high with books . He opened one at random . An " art " book , reproductions of masterpieces : Aphrodite through the Ages . It fell open at the title page and he saw that it had been edited by one of his old drinking companions , Joe Bliss , and reflected on how sometimes in the world of the arts men were able to turn their weaknesses to material profit . Joe Bliss , at twenty-four , had been as big a drunkard as Horne Watts and his literary interestshad been chiefly pornographic . Now he was an authority  --  onart and love ? Claiborne turned a page idly and came on that body whose lovely limbs Giorgione portrays as clinging to the earth as if to its cradle . But Luini 's Venus sits at right angles to the earth and holds a mirror in her hand . He turned another page . Cranach 's Venus holds no mirror . High-breasted , flat-loined , she stares straight into the beholdingeye . For how long has that cold , heavy-lidded gaze been turned on man ? He wondered how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisky last night and had a dull headache , which , he knew from experience , would increase rather than diminish until the cocktail hour came around and he started drinking again . The dream he had had last night still haunted him . Travelingalong a shadowy road , he had rounded a bend and come suddenly upon a house . It stood close to the road and yet high above it . A woman sat on the threshold , as if throned . Her figure almost blocked the doorway but he could see light beyond her shoulders and he heard the sound of stringed instruments and knew that there was music and dancing within . It seemed to him that the woman had been calling out something in a loud voice until he came , when she rose and silently stood aside so that he might pass down into the house . Standing on the threshold , looking down , he felt his whole being suffused with a wild , secret pleasure , but the stairway down into the house was steeper than he had thought , and darker . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall where many people moved to and fro . And then he was seated at a table with others and the wild music was playing all about them , thought with a strange softness , and , as it were , secretly , so that he turned to a fellow guest , planning to ask some cunning question which would reveal whether the music was heard by all or only by him , but the figure that turned toward him was fleshless inside its shroudingrobe and its hollow eye sockets were lighted by flames fiercer than burn in any mortal eye and he looked about him and saw that every man in the vast hall was in like case and knew that he was in the depths of hell . He looked back at the glass cubicle . Vera was no longer visible , but Max still sat there , bent forward from the waist , his elbows resting on his knees , his chin sunk in his cupped hands . When he assumed that pose he was supposed to be so rapt by the Muse that he was hardly aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in that old studio on L'Impasse des Deux Anges , he used to beg Horne to " turnp190that damned phonograph off , " but now he could sit like this for hours . The less work he did , the more he loved music ! What did the fellow hear when he sat like that ? The wheels going around in his head ? The same wheels that go around in mine ? he asked himself , and started ; a hand had been laid on his arm . Vera stood so close to him that her shoulder touched his . She looked smaller than usual today , and somehow more unfashionable . It was that clark fur stole she had drawn about her shoulders . It had belonged to her mother and she got it out religiously every fall since Margot died , a few years after their marriage , and wore it a few times  --  presumably in memory of her mother . She was saying that she wanted to buy Cynthia some books . " Why ? " he asked before he could collect himself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves , Tom . Lester Vail kept all her books . He said they were part of his professional equipment . " When would she ever take her eyes  --  which he had always found too blue  --  off his face ? His hatred was so great that he felt his whole body tempered by it , like a blade held in readinessand drawn from its scabbard for some fell intent . There is a hatred that is reserved for the innocent . What right have they got not to know ? But they are more formidable , more dangerous when they forsake the bliss that is their inheritance and strike toward knowledge . If only she had been content to remain what she was when he found her , a bird fluttering on a terrace that a man might pick up and warm in his bosom , a bird that would nestle tamely , grateful for any warmth it might come by , and not be always turning its fierce , golden eye on yours , not always be beating its maimed wing against your breast ! He knew as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts that had gone through her head during the past week . She had suspected that something was going on between him and Cynthia and then had succeeded in convincingherself that her suspicions were unjust . With her ap191thought was no sooner entertained than it was translated into action . She might have hated Cynthia last night  --  for she was capable of hate , for all her kindness  --  but today she would shower her with gifts to make up for having suspected her . . . . He must say something quickly or she would never take those eyes off his face . He said : " It 's even Stephen , is n't it ? She walked out on him . " " She had to , Tom . Has she ever told you anything about what it was like , living with him ? " " A little , " he said . " Well , I do n't think she 'd like that book . Joe Bliss 's introduction is fatuous . " She nodded docilely and moved off down the aisle , the dark thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrance was wafted from it . She claimed that if she buried her nose in the fur she could catch a whiff of the rose geranium perfume her mother had used . The stole caught on a protruding corner of a book and slipped from her shoulders to the floor . She put her hand out absently . He stood where he was and watched the hand close on air , then watched her stoop and retrieve the stole and lay it again about her shoulders and thought of the years he had trailed in the wake of Margot Vincent  --  Margot Vincent , born Pearl Clancy , in life an ignorantfool  --  but it had taken all thn will power he could summonnot to move forward to lift from the floor her garment discarded these twenty years ! She was studying the books ranged in cases along the wall , her lips moving as she recited titles . Without taking her eyes off the shelves she called out to ask him whether he thought that Cynthia would like " a good new translation of the Timaeus ? " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and added , " It 's too hot in here . " " You could get them to open a window , " she murmured . " Vera , I ca n't stand here all day while Max moons over records . " She looked surprised , then said : " I 'll tell him . " " No . I 'm going on over to Fourth Avenue . "  | " Fourth Avenue ? " " Yes . Cooper 's saving some books for me . " " Could n't you telephone ? " " No , " he said , " I want the air , " and walked toward the street entrance . Behind shifting panes of glass a face spun toward him . He had to stand and wait until the door completedits revolution and discharged Marcia Crenfew almost into his arms . She said : " Why , Tom , what are you doing here ? " " Nothing , " he said , and stepped past her without any other greeting . The early morning had been chill , but the day had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , intensely blue sky . A wind blew a salt smell up from the river . He left the avenue and walked west . On the way he passed the grimy old-fashioned office building in which Spectra had its offices . He looked at his watch . A quarter of twelve . Cynthia would not have gone out to lunch . He telephoned her from a booth in a cigar store . She laughed when she heard his voice  --  he had told her that he really intended to lunch with Trowbridge that day . She seemed reluctant to meet him for lunch ; she had work on hand that had to be finished by a certain date . He knew then that he must see her before the day was over . " May I come there , then , for a few minutes ? " She asked him where he was and when he told her she replied , after a second 's hesitation , that she would meet him at her apartment in a few minutes . She was not there when he arrived . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its usual exquisiteorder . The glass doors that opened on the terrace were closed but morning sunlight poured through them onto the fawn-colored rug . I-le sat down on the sofa in a square patch of sunlight . The opposite wall seemed nearer than it ever had before . Too near . The whole place was too small for occupancy by more than one person . When she came he would tell her that they must go somewhere else . To the beach , perhaps . One could be snug there behind glass walls and yet have sunlight all about.  |p193The  door opened . She stood before him in a gray dress and a dark coat that she had not taken time to fasten . When he had telephoned her it had seemed to him imperative that he see her , and now she was in the same room with him but it was not the way he had thought it would be . There had been a moment , as she came into the room , when she did not seem to want to recognize his presence , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were somebody else in the room whom she must greet before she greeted him . He made an impatient movement . She came closer to him and asked him if anything had happened . " What should happen ? " he asked , and took her in his arms , but even as she submitted herself to his embrace , she drew back to look at him questioningly . " You came into town with Vera and Max . Nothing was said ? Nothing happened ? " " Vera was trying to decide whether you 'd like the Timaeus for Christmas and Max was trying to decide whether to presenthimself with Frescobaldi or Mozart , " he said , " but nothing had happened when I left them  --  at Sloane 's and Reynolds ' . " She laughed then . " You could n't take it ? " " No , " he said , " I could n't take it . " She had been moving away from him as they spoke , into the kitchen . She opened the door of the refrigerator . " Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always canned soup . And there 's some lettuce . . . . But you ca n't have any dessert . " " I want a monumental dessert today , " he said . " The kind the waiter brings in and bows over  --  flaming . " She frowned a little . " Tom , let 's do n't do anything reck-less . " " Would a Baba au rhum be reckless ? " " It depends on where we got it . After all , Vera is in town today . " " Then let 's go out of town ! " he said . " Where ? " " Jones Beach , " he said . " Atlantic City . . . Far Rockaway . . . the Canary Islands . . . "  |p194She  let the refrigerator door swing to and gave him a quick look , but her face remained composed , her eyes suffered no appreciable change as they received his own gaze . She walked back into the living room and sat down on the little sofa . " You are in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her , his suddenly shaking hands clasped behind him , he said : " I am not going back there . " He had not known that those were the words he was going to utter and he heard them with wonder . Her expression did not change but she suddenly shifted her position on the sofa . " You mean to Blencker 's Brook ? " she said . He said : " To Blencker 's Brook , " thinking how hard the syllables came , like something  --  a head ?  --  cut off and falling on the frozen ground . But he must pay attention to what she was saying : " Do you think it 's wise to break things off as suddenly as this ? " " It is n't a matter of what 's wise or unwise , " he said , " as you 'd realize if you cared anything about me . " She was on her feet then . Her arms were about his neck . She murmured endearments . He let his arms come up about her slight figure and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own slow-churning heart quicken its beat to keep time with hers . Her face was pressed so tight against his breast that he could not hear what she was saying . It is better that way . Oh , my love , the hard winter sunshine is all about us , but there is a place if we could win to it , where no grass grows , no bird sings , no eye looks into any other eye , no word is spoken ... . She freed herself from his arms with a quick twisting movement . At the same time he heard feet on the stairs . She was whispering : " They rang downstairs , but we did n't hear them . And now they are coming up . " " They ? " he said . " Who ? Who 's coming up ? " She was no longer at his side . She was standing before the bookshelves . Her hand went out , took a book from the shelf . She whirled about , book in hand . Somebody had been knocking on a door for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said heavily ,  |p195and  would have gone into the kitchen but she shook her head . " No ! " she said . " The place is too small . " She went to the door and opened it . Vera entered , followed by Marcia Crenfew . They were followed by Max , who lingered behind them to close the door carefully . Vera started at the sound and her eyes darted about the room before they came to rest on her husband 's face . She said : " Marcia thought we 'd find you here . " " You did , " he said . Cynthia moved forward quickly , the book still in her hand . She said : " Tom just told me you were thinking of giving me a copy of the Timaeus . But I bought one for myself the other day . . . . " Vera turned her head and looked at her , then looked back at her husband . She said : " I know something 's the matter . . . . I 've known it for weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spoken , she said : " It 's all right , darling ! " Red burned in her cheeks but she held her head high . She held her head too high . She always had . He could not bear the way that head took color from the surrounding air . She took a step toward him . He stayed her with his hand upraised . Somewhere an arrow cleaved thee air and found its mark . But she was a stubborn quarry . Even while she flinched , she pressed on . " It 's all right , darling , " she said again . " No , it 's not all right , " he said . " Marcia , let 's get out of here , " Max said . " Vera , why do n't you and Tom go somewhere and talk this over . " " It seems to have been already talked over . By all of you , " Claiborne said . Vera made a quick , passionate gesture toward Max without taking her eyes off her husband 's face . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on like this , " he said , " as you would have seen long ago  --  if you had n't been so blinded by concern for yourself . " " Myself ! " she cried . Oh , the dart had lodged , all right ! That head , with its crisp , springing curls was bent now over her own side from which all along the blood had been flow/ing . She raised her head to utter the words he had known she would utter : " I see . . . . You never loved me . " " We are not talking about the past , " he said . " It 's a questionof the present . We ca n't entertain the same emotions at forty-eight that we did at twenty-eight . " " You never loved me ! " she cried despairingly . " I always knew it . . . . I do n't see why you married me . " Claiborne remained erect , staring at her , but he felt as if he crouched in some vast , windy place beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had been sentient a momentago , but it was still now and no sound came from it . . . . There was something that had to be done before he could lie down beside it . He said : " I should think that would be obvious . " Never had her eyes been fixed so intently on his facet " You mean for my money ? " she said in a low , wondering tone and then , as if repeating words she had heard uttered by some other voice than her own , she said again , " For my money ! " and said something in the same low tone to Cynthia and , followed by the two others , went from the room . Neither of the two in the room stirred until the heels quit striking on the stairs , then Cynthia gave a low sigh . There were tears in her eyes , but a brightness on her lips . She was coming toward him . He moved toward her , but not without a moment 's hesitation . It seemed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . He had to step over their bodies before he could take her in his arms.  | " Well , Billy , I guess the next thing is to get these letters out , " Ed Archer said . The nervous , dark-haired young man said , " Right , Boss ! " As he gathered up his papers he looked over at Claiborne , his eyes shining . " Then you 'll be in Monday ? " " Monday ? " Claiborne said . " The sooner the better , " Ed said , " but make it later in the week if you 'd rather , Tom . " " Oh , I can make it all right , " Claiborne said as he stood up to shake hands for the second time with the nervous young man . His name was William Pettigrew . Several years ago Claiborne had recommended a volume of his critical essays to a publisher , but that was before he joined the staff of Parade , where he was popularly considered Ed 's right-hand man , as Ed , in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many executives whose advice and counsel were oftenest sought and taken by its millionaire owner . The sheet of paper that Pettigrew was carefully stowing in a folder was a list of the names of authors who were to be invited to write for the new literary magazine Parade was launching , a magazine whose editorship Claiborne would assume next Monday morning . When the door had closed behind Pettigrew , Ed said indulgently , " This is a great day for Billy . " " For Billy ? " Claiborne said . " He 's so excited over the prospect of working with you hep200does n't know what he 's doing . It 's a great day for me too , Tom . . . . The Old Man 's had this notion of a literary magazinefor two years now . I 've had a hard time holding him back . But I knew there was no use in launching it unless we could get the right line-up . You 've got to get some regular contributors to start with , I told him , and they 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in your judgment , every one of those writers is a topnotcher , is n't he ? " " Topnotcher ? " Claiborne said . " I mean a literary man who , as a literary man , is of the same caliber as  --  oh , say Addison Skate . " He laughed . " It never rains but it pours . We signed him up today too . " " Who 's Addison Skate ? " " Why , I 'd say that he occupies the same position among foreign correspondents that you do among editors , Tom . Always a step ahead of the rest . First man to get into Russia after the first Five-Year Plan just as you  --  you did publish Halloway 's first stuff in Spectra , did n't you ? " Damn the fellow ! Claiborne thought . He 's trying to make me tell him how good I am so he can feel smart for hiring me ! Aloud he said : " He sent us the manuscript . We 'd have been fools if we had n't published it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe you can classify writers . " " Oh , of course . Still , these men are all first class , or you would n't have them on your list ? " " They have some things in common  --  a certain amount of skill in writing , for instance  --  but I would n't attempt to classify them , " Claiborne said stubbornly , and would have risen to end the interview , but Ed , almost as if forgetful of his presence , had swiveled his chair about so that he could look out of the window behind his desk . The window , an expanse of plate glass as wide as the wall of a small house , commanded a panoramic view of mid-town Manhattan . Ed 's desk , fashioned of some kind of wood that nobody had ever heard of before , was as big as a boxcar . Everything of the largest and the best , Claiborne reflected , and he was now ,  |p201or  would be , come next Monday , a not inconsiderable part of it . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must look about for a job . His separation from Vera had considerably straitened his means ; his inheritance from his uncle had been spent on Spectra , and he earned little . I-le had reminded himself that one ca n't get a job without letting it be known that one is looking for one and was casting about in his mind as to which of his friends to approach first when Cynthia suggested that he go to see Ed Archer before he saw anybody else . " He might have something that would be just the thing , " she said . When he asked her how in the world she knew Ed Archer 's plans she would only smile mysteriously . It was astonishing , he reflected , how quickly Cynthia had come to know her way about in literary New York . Three months ago she knew nobody except by correspondence , or next to nobody . Now she appeared to know everybody . She was like the goldfish that one moment is gasping for air on the living-room rug and the next glides sinuously about the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had just left the room was doubtless the source of her information about Ed 's plans for the literary editorship at Parade . He remembered now her telling him of meeting young Pettigrew at a party a few nights before . Ed Archer was one of his oldest friends but he was somehownot one he would have thought of turning to in a difficulty ( it was being borne in on him that his present situation was not without difficulties ) , but Ed 's response when he telephonedhim had been spontaneous and warm : " Of course we can find you a job , Tom  --  if you want one , " and then , hesitantly , as if it were he , not Claiborne , who was asking a favor : " You could n't run down here a few minutes ? There 's something I 'd like to talk over with you . " The " something " was the editorship of a new literary magazine , to appear under Parade 's aegis . It appeared that Ed had been planning it for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man for the job . Hep202was beside himself with joy at the prospect of working with Claiborne , for whom he had an unbounded admiration . It had all been settled  --  except for the contract which would be signed on Monday morning  --  within ten minutes of the time Claiborne had walked into the room . Ed did not seem to feel that he had acted with extraordinary dispatch . He was probably in the habit of making important decisions all day long : he was , after all , an influential man and as executive editor of Parade played his part in world affairs . Yet he sat there now , gazing out of the window as dreamily as if his work were over for the day . His stillness , his abstraction had a quality that struck Claiborne as unusual . I never saw him sit like that before . What is he thinking about ? He got up . Ed rose too , and walked with him toward the door . Halfway across the vast expanse of carpet he stopped before a group of framed photographs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening ? " he asked . Claiborne looked and saw his eighteen-year-old self standing with a sandwich in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other beside a table that was stacked high with newspapers . Ed stood at the other end of the table . " First issue we got out at school , " Ed said . " Remember Bugs Graham came in and snapped us just as we got ' em all folded ? " " I remember we folded every damn paper by hand and it took us till two o'clock in the morning , " Claiborne said , " but I do n't remember Bugs taking that picture . And I never saw it before . " " Is that so ? " Ed said . " I thought he sent you a print . . . . Poor Bugs ! He 's sports editor of some paper up in West Virginia but he gets to town every now and then and he and I and Charley Sloane have dinner together . " " I have n't seen Bugs Graham , or Charley Sloane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you keep up with them all , Ed ? " Ed smiled . " Well , I 've been here at Parade for ten years .  |p203Claiborne  laughed . " That 's one advantage of staying put  --  or disadvantage . " " It 's an advantage , on the whole , " Ed said mildly . " I like to keep up with the boys . And you never know what a connectionwill turn up  --  in my business . " He let his hand rest for a second on Claiborne 's arm . " If I had n't kept in touch with you all these years Parade would n't be getting you for a literary editor . . . . " That 's mighty nice , " Claiborne said . They shook hands . Ed 's secretary appeared and piloted Claiborne through the outer office to the elevator . The elevator began its lightninglikedescent from the thirty-eighth to the main floor . Claiborne , frowning , wished that he had not taken leave of Ed Archer so hurriedly . There had been a second there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a handclasp while the other hand lay lightly on Claiborne 's arm  --  when he had been aware of Ed 's eyes seeking his face in a glance that was more intent , more prolonged than any glance Ed had given him during the past half-hour . The nature of that glance eluded him but he had an impression that it was out of the ordinary . There had been something in Ed 's look that had never been there before  --  or was it that something that had always been there before was not there now ? Or am I imagining the whole business ? he asked himself , and heard somewhere a dry chuckle . " Keep on like that , " the Voice said , " keep on and you 'll end in some nice booby hatch . " The Voice , he noted absently , had become less discursive in the last few weeks . The few remarks it had made were ironic and it never engaged in argument . That was rather a relief , on the whole . The operator was turning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Main floor , sir ? " " Right you are , " he said , and left the elevator and joined the crowd that surged through the entrance out to the street .  |p204The  restaurant where he was to meet Cynthia was three blocks away . As he walked , he looked at his watch . It was alreadyone o'clock . He ought to have left the office half an hour ago but just as he was on the point of leaving young Pettigrew had come in with a batch of letters , letters written in response to the letters he himself had sent out two weeks ago . Not everyone whom he had addressed could accede to his request . Herman Blaine wrote that he hardly expected to live long enough to finish the work for which he already had commitments . At the same time he warmly applauded Claiborne'seditorship of the new magazine . " It is , " he wrote , " the kind of thing one has always thought ought to happen but which hardly ever does happen . " Young Pettigrew had been delighted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , had felt a lift of his spirit . It occurred to him that he had spent half his life avoiding offices . He wondered whether it had not been a mistake . The light routine of his new job provided an agreeable framework for his days and left him as much leisure as he could use ; one always worked better when one had a deadline . He had finished his piece on Keats . There was no reason why he should not go on to write something else . In the last few days he had actually felt stirrings of his imagination . He walked on faster . Cynthia was doubtless already at the restaurant ; she had had time enough to finish her errand . It was an errand on which he should have accompanied her , since it was of interest to both of them . It was almost as if his and Vera 's separation were a fruit budding underground on some great swollen vine , apprehendedby all , awaited by all , and hailed when it thrust forth into the light of day . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less delicately veiled sympathyand to offer him the use of the Brodos ' apartment while they were abroad during the coming year . His club , where he had been staying ever since he left Blencker 's Brook , had relayed the call to him at Cynthia 's apartment . When he told her of Marianne 's offer , adding in/differently that he had no intention of accepting it , she had been silent a little , then had pointed out something he had not thought of : the present housing shortage made it next to impossible to find a desirable vacant apartment at any price . " Do you want to go on living at your club ? " she had asked . " God , no ! " he had said . " I hate the place . " They had agreed that under the circumstances Marianne 's offer was perhaps providential , and Cynthia had gone this morning to look at the apartment . Marianne and Edmund Brodo had alreadydeparted but Marianne had left instructions with the superintendent of the building " in case you change your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much want to take over the Brodos ' possessions , desirable as they were . On the other hand , one must live somewhere , and it was true that he was tired of living at the club . One of his classmates , Hock Andrews , lately divorced from a meat-packing heiress , always seemed to choose to eat alone in the dining room on the same nights that he himself did . They had shared the same table twice , and that , Claiborne thought , was worse than eating alone and looking up every few minutes to find Hock in the act of looking the other way . But he had had very few dinners at the club . Almost everybody he knew was asking him to dinner . And most of them wanted him to bring Cyr , this . They had dined with the Waites last night . Willy Stokes had been there . It had been fifteen years  --  twelve , anyhow  --  since he had seen Willy Stokes . He had seen a good deal of him that spring they came back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Willy had hung around a lot then . He had been out of Harvard long enough to realize that even when you have as much money as he had it is hard to know what to do with yourself . A handsome fellow , with large , dark eyes and an engaging manner . Bob had a notion that Willy would have liked to play the role of Maecenas to Spectra , and used to go on about how bright Willy was . Tom had maintained that Willy was not bright enough to make a Maecenas . " Takes a hell of a fellow forp206that . All he 's got in those Brooks Brothers pockets  --  besides his money  --  is some bad poems . If we let him put money into Spectra he 'll be wanting us to publish them . " It had looked last night as if Bob were going to get his wish at last . Cynthia had a project to follow the symposium Tom was editing : a series of short books  --  long essays , really  --  on major British poets by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got the idea from his essay on Keats , and she and Bob both thought that the series ought to be under his editorship . Bob liked the idea and talked confidentlyof putting it into execution . He must be going to get the money from Willy ; several times during the evening Willy had spoken up , quite as if he were in on the thing . He had more assurance now than he had had in the old days . But that was only natural . The fellow was a good deal older . It had seemed to him that it was no skin off his nose , anyhow , since he was no longer an editor of Spectra , merely a contributor . And it had been good to have for a whole evening the kind of talk they had had . They had stayed till after midnight and then he and Cynthia had walked back across Washington Square to her apartment on Bedford Street . They had stood in the Square , at two o'clock in the morning , under the dim light of a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cop approaching until he inquired deferentially if anything were wrong , whereupon they both burst out laughing . It was the kind of thing you do when you are young . ' The exhilaration of that moment still persisted . Or was it the weather ? The air that lapped his cheek felt as soft as honey . Spring was on its way . For some days now he had had a feeling of moving toward a goal , of being involved in some significant action . " A new life , " the Voice said . " You are beginning a new life . " Was he not beginning a new life ? A writer of any stature , he reminded himself , becomes two or three different men during his lifetime . The early Yeats seems to have had only a bowing acquaintance with the later Yeats . It is hard to realize that Richard III and The Tempest were written by thep207same man . These inner changes have their outer manifestations , which is why so many people marry for the second  --  or third or fourth  --  time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in his forties ! He had arrived at the restaurant . Cynthia was not in the first dining room . He walked through it and down a narrow hall back into the garden , still glassed in for winter , and saw her sitting at a table under an arbor at the far end . She was wearing a light wool dress and a broad-brimmed hat . Shadows cast by the vines overhead swayed over her light dress . She sat motionless , her head a little bent , as if in deep thought . He sat down opposite her . She started , lifting a face that , even shaded by the broad hat brim , gave off something more like radiance than he had ever seen on it before . He said : " You look as if you had good news . " She leaned toward him . " You did n't tell me it was such a fabulous place ! " she said . " And you did n't tell me that there were two apartments ! " " That 's right , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sick . " Edmund Brodo had had a stroke a year ago and as a result had been paralyzed in one side of his body . Marianne , exhibitinga resourcefulness that all her women friends found commendable , had rented the apartment across the hall and had turned it into a miniature hospital . Edmund Brodo had spent the last year there , between wheel chair and bed , attended by day and night nurses , but some new treatment had lately improved his condition and Marianne was flying him to Majorca for a change . He remembered the first time he and Vera had gone to see the Brodos after Ned was stricken . Marianne had given them tea in the lofty drawing room , the blues and pinks and roses of whose walls seemed to spring like flowers from the great fawn-colored carpet under their feet . When they had finished their tea they were taken across the hall to have drinks with Ned . The room Ned was confined to was as spacious as the one they had just left . He lay in a bed whose framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving that Marianne had brought back from Norway . The bed , for all its medieval splendor , was a hospital bed and had a crank by which it could be raised and lowered so that Ned , who was paralyzed on his right side , could assume several different positions . A fourteenth-century mine fleurs tapestry portrayinga hunting scene covered the wall beside his bed . On the wall opposite hung the big Matisse , one of those that , as Max said , you could " get inside and run around in . " The Brodos had been among the first people to rent pictures from museums . The bed faced the window . Ned had lain there for a year , looking out on the river . They had all gathered around Ned 's bed to drink a great many Old Fashioneds . " The doctorsays that liquor is good for Ned . Is n't that divine ? " Mariannesaid . There was a girl , demure in dark dress and white collar and cuffs , who came in every now and then and stood with her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laughed when he asked afterward who she was . " The nurse , darling ! Marianne does n't like them to wear uniforms . " " I can see that we need a place to live in , " he said to Cynthia , " but do we need a setup as grand as the Brodos ' ? " " But if it 's simply handed over to us . . . ? I stayed there a full hour , just walking around . . . . It 's a marvelous set-ting ! " " For what ? " " For you and me ! " " I 'm a diamond in the rough , " he said , " I do n't want to be set . " She laughed . " It is n't so much the splendor of the place  --  though it is splendid  --  as what we could do with it . " " We could n't change it , " he said in alarm . " We could n't do anything but live in it  --  temporarily . " Her smile deepened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , would n't have the imagination to do . " " Their parties are pretty stuffy , " he said . " That way beforeNed took sick . Marianne thinks that two celebrities makep209a party . Sometimes she gets people who have n't spoken to each other for years . " " Our parties wo n't be stuffy , " she said . Claiborne was silent , overcome by an embarrassment that of late he sometimes felt in her presence . She was more forthright  --  morehonest , he told himself  --  in going about their new life than he was . He told himself , too , that he must not forget that she was thirteen years younger than he and had lived most of her life in the provinces , in the company of dullards . Marianne Brodo was one of the worst lion-hunters he had ever known ( he could hear her now : " Tom Claiborne ? Why , at the moment he 's living in my apartment in New York . " ) but to this girl she must appear like the fairy godmother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always felt is waiting for her . Who was he to keep her golden coach waiting ? He was asking a good deal of her now . It was in deference to what she called his " horse and buggy " prejudicesthat they had agreed not to set up a common menage until both their divorces were granted . He wanted to sleep with her every night but he did not want to live in the same house with her as long as she was married to another man . She had burst out laughing when he told her that . She hardly remembered her husband 's existence , she said , unless he remindedher of it . Neither of them had mentioned Vera . It would be some time , he thought , with wry relish , before his divorce went through . It took time to get a divorce , even if you had money . Robert Elliott , the Vincents ' lawyer , had called him into conference soon after his and Vera 's separationto announce that Mrs. Claiborne wanted a divorce . Mr. Elliott had mentioned other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been held in common , joint signatures that had to be attached to various instruments . As he was on his way out a younger member of the firm had appeared and had said that he had a message for him from Mrs. Claiborne . He had followed the young lawyer into a smaller office , whereupon the scoundrel , having taken the precaution to barricade himself behind his desk , hadP210relayed the message from Mrs. Claiborne : His aunt , Miss Virginia Claiborne , had that morning arrived safely at Resthaven , Tennessee . He did not hit the fellow , but he did say , " Do you think I give a damn ? " before he walked out . Since then he had refused all invitations to conferences . His own lawyer , Joe Grant , had to handle everything as best he could . Joe had telephoned him two days ago to say that there might be further postponement ; Mrs. Claiborne had not yet decidedwhere she would establish her residence . He watched the intricate tracery of leaf and stem waver over the white cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass the waiter had just set before him . His own life , shattered four months ago ( it was only four months since that morning in Cynthia 's apartment ) , shattered , it seemed , as irrevocably as if some one of them had seized some precious , irreplaceable object and had raised it high to dash it into a thousand pieces on the floor , was reforming , taking on new proportions , dimensions , and if the vine , the leaf that shaped themselves before him appeared at times as tenuous , as insubstantial as those shadows wavering there on the tablecloth , they were nevertheless the only forms that presented themselves . It behooved him to lay hold of them . " I suppose we will have to do some entertaining , " he said . " We ca n't entertain  --  in our present situation  --  but you certainlywill have to do a certain amount of entertaining in connection with this job . I should think that it might be helpful  --  as well as agreeable  --  to have a female neighbor across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and put the flowers and things around and then run back across the hall and powder her nose and come back and make an entrance ? " he said with a laugh . " Exactly , " she said . " Oh , you 'll see ! We 'll have wonderful parties . " He looked at her curiously . " It 's extraordinary , " he said , " how you think things out ahead . " " And it 's extraordinary to me , how you never think evenp211one step ahead . . . . But never mind . That 's not your metier . " Claiborne did not answer . As she was speaking , he had looked up to find himself gazing straight into Robin Vincent'seyes . Halting in the doorway , as if he had been on the point of entering the garden until something arrested his attention , Robin let his eyes travel slowly from Claiborne 's face to that of his companion . It was the same look that Hock Andrews had given Claiborne once or twice in the club dining room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes caught Claiborne 's . Claiborne felt his face flush . He looked straight at Robin and nodded curtly but unmistakably . There was an appreciable instant during which Robin , not altering his stance by a hairsbreadth , stared back . Then his ordinarily impassive face seemed to undergo a further process of congealment . His eyes left his brother-in-law 's face and rested briefly on the vine-clad trellis behind Claiborne , before he turned away . Claiborne smothered an exclamation and got up . " What is it ? " Cynthia said quickly . " A call , " he said , " I forgot a call I 've got to make , " and started for the door . " But you have n't ordered ! " she cried . " You order for me , " he said , and without looking back , walked rapidly toward the door . The little hall was empty . He passed through it swiftly and stood on the threshold of the dining room which he had quitted only a few minutes before . There had not been many people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled . He stood in the doorway and looked from table to table , but he could not see Robin anywhere . A'waiter , seekingto carry a loaded tray through the double doors , brushed against him with a reproachful murmur . Claiborne stepped aside and , flattening his back against the wall , stood there long enough to rake every table again with his eye . RobinP212was not at any of them . The waiter was on his way back with his empty tray . Claiborne shook his head in response to the questioning glance . " He 's not here , " he said , and turned into the hall . It was narrow , paved with dark red octagonal-shaped tiles that had running through each one of them a long wavy line , with a shorter line reproducing the same wave on each side of it . He had not been back to Blencker 's Brook . He had not had to go back . His personal possessions had been packed up and deposited in a storage house where , a suitably junior member of the fine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and select whatever he needed at his convenience . Astonishing how quickly and smoothly these things can be handled if one has enough money ! Apparently he had all along been only a cog in the powerful , smoothly running machine that was the Vincent estate  --  a cog that once it showed an imperfection , a flaw , would naturally be got rid of . " I would n't , Tom , " Max had said , " I would n't even try to talk to her . It would only make things worse . . . . The door at the end of the little hall was of glass and you could see the garden through it . Was there some imperfection in the glass of the door ? Seen from the dark , oblong box that was the hall , the light out there was too bright , almost lurid . The shadows were everywhere too black , everywhere except on Cynthia 's face , shaded by the broad hat . She was looking around as if to find out whether there was anybody there she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Martini glass to her lips . But even when she threw her head a little back to sip from the glass the brim of her hat laid a band of shadow across her eyes and forehead . . . . He had seen her face once before in the shadow of a broad hat . Where was it ? There is something about the sun being a light by day and the moon by night . Could it be the other way around ? A man seeking to travel by day by the light of the moon ? What a fool you are ! Because a woman 's name is Cynthia . Be all right if she was named Betsy ? P213The tiles under his feet suddenly blazed pink . A door had opened . A man emerged from the little room on his right , stared at him and went on down the hall into the garden . Claiborne entered the little room . There was nothing in it except two telephone booths and under an open window a stand which held telephone directories . He glanced into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck , looked into his eyes , then looked away indifferently as she put a morselof lobster into her mouth . " I do n't think that that is exactly what she meant , " she said as soon as she could speak . Claiborne pulled the window down and stood with his back to it , his arms folded . What was the matter with Robin Vincent  --  beside the fact that he had cut him " direct , " as they said ? To be " cut direct " is to have another human being deny that you exist and you can not imagine what that feels like until it has happened to you . But there is something else that has to be thought about now . It was the way he looked . Even if Cynthiaand I had not been here he would not have stayed in the garden , he would have gone on somewhere else . He came here because he has to go somewhere and he has gone on to another place and from that place he will go on somewhere else . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Why is it that he can not stop anywhere ? He stepped into the telephone booth and pulled the door to behind him and dialed the long-distance operator . The call went through quickly . He heard Gershon 's muted voice : " Miz Claiborne 's residence . " He said : " Gershon . . . " " Tom ! " " Yes , " he said , " yes . It 's Tom , Gershon . I want to speak to Miss Vera . " There was silence . A Catholic friend of his had told him that once in a confessional booth there had been , after he had recited his sins , a silence so long that he had had time to feel quite certain that he was damned . He heard with relief the sound that told him that Gershon was laying the receiver down on its little table . Gershon was too tactful to summonp214Vera by the house telephone . He would go upstairs and knock softly on her door and utter the name of the person who wanted to speak to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might not , at first , want to come . . . . But Gershon had not gone away . He was speaking : " Mister Tom , Miz Claiborne ai n't here . . . . Not right now , she ai n't . . . . Mister Max will be here in a minute . " He sat upright as if suddenly transfixed by an electric charge . Gershon had said " Tom ! " at first . It had been twenty years since Gershon had called him Tom . . . . And he had not said " Miss Vera " as he usually did . . . . He had called her " Mrs. Claiborne . " . . . He cried out loud . " What is it ? What 's going on out there ? " When he got no answer he flung the receiver down and would have rushed from the room but he heard inside the instrumenta faint clicking and picked it up again . Max said : " Tom ? " " Yes . Yes . I 'm here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is , Dr. Reynolds feels pretty sure she 's going to be all right . Weak , of course , but she 's conscious , and there 's been no relapse . " " You are talking about Vera ? " " Last night , " Max said . " She 'd have been dead if Robin had n't turned back . Started for the Browns and forgot his lighter and went back . . . . " " Where ? Where ? " " In her own room . In her bed . The door was shut but you could hear her breathing all over the house . Robin thought that it might be one of the dogs , but he could n't find a dog anywhere in the house and he went out and got in his car and then he thought no dog ever sounded like that and he went back into the house and called and called but she did n't answer and all he could hear was that breathing and he went up and opened the door . . . . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital in Bethsaida , " Max said . " Had to take her in an ambulance . In the middle of the night . "  | " I 'll drive . Be faster than any train I can get . " He was about to put the receiver up when he heard Max 's voice , raised a note : " Tom ! Hang on there . Tom ! " " What is it ? " " Torn , you ca n't go to that hospital . " " Why ca n't I ? " he asked wildly . " Why ca n't I go there ? " " She 's conscious , " Max said . " I told you she was conscious , did n't I ? She said not to let you in . As soon as she came to she told the doctor not to let you in and he 's given orders . If you go there they wo n't let you in . " Claiborne sat silent . " Hello ! " Max 's voice said . " Tom , can you hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I hear you all right . " " I just wanted to be sure . God , I 'm half crazy , myself . But do n't worry about me . Tom , I 'm coming into town . Can I get you at your office ? " Claiborne took the instrument away from his ear and let it fall on his knee . It went on babbling for several minutes . He could distinguish words : " . . . meet you . . . reach you . . . got to see you . . . know it 's terrible but worst over . . . everything be all right . . . Damn it , why do n't you answer me ? " It fell silent after that . He continued to sit where he was , staring straight before him . The door opened . A face protrudeditself into his field of vision . A voice said : " The young lady wants to know is anything wrong , sir ? " Claiborne shook his head . " No , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The face disappeared . He got up and laid the receiver carefully on its hook and went through the narrow passageway out into the garden . Cynthia was sitting with her eyes fixed on the door . When she saw him she got up and came toward him . " Vera tried to commit suicide last night , " he said . " Sleepingpills . They 've got her in the hospital at Bethsaida . " " Is she all right now ? " she asked quickly.  | " Max said she 'd been conscious for some hours and there 's been no relapse . " " Was she alone in the house ? " she asked after a moment . " Robin found her . " He gave a short laugh . " He thought it was a dog and then he came back and pushed her door open and found her . . . . " She said : " Let 's do n't talk about it now , Tom . You must n't talk about it now . " He looked about him , bewildered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've already paid . And here 's your hat . Let 's go . " They went through the hall and the almost empty dining room . Out on the street Claiborne turned automatically to the left . They came to Madison Avenue and walked down it a few blocks . Suddenly she stopped . " Do you think you ought to go to your office now ? " she asked . " I suppose not , " he said . " Would you like to go down to my apartment ? " " It 's too far . " She caught her breath . " I ca n't leave you like this here in the street ! " she said , then added in a quieter tone : " I have an errand to do . Would you like to go with me  --  in a cab ? It 's too far to walk . " " As you like , " he said politely , and stepping to the curb hailed a cab . They went to the East River Drive . There they dismissed the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a green bench that sat on a bluff overlooking the river . She asked if he would rest there while she did her errand . " I 'm not tired , " he said . " I know , " she said , " but if you keep on walking how will I find you when I come back ? " She went away and he sat down on the bench and stared at the river . The water was dull green but laced with yellowish foam ; there was a great deal of traffic . He watched a tugboat nosing along in the wake of a South American freighter . What was that boat doing this far upstream ? But he had notp217listened when Cynthia gave the driver the address . He did not know how far uptown he was . He turned around and looking at the street sign knew why the place seemed familiar . The Brodos ' apartment was right around the corner . She must be there now . He wondered what her errand was there . He heard light steps behind him and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seat beside him , she held up a book . " I thought we 'd be going up to look at the apartments after lunch and I left this there . Silly of me . I thought I 'd better go and get it . " They sat without speaking for several minutes , then she said : " There 's something I might have told you before . . . . I do n't know whether I ought to tell you now . " " Tell me now , " he said . " Did you know that Carlo committed suicide ? " " Flow did he do it ? " " The same way . Sleeping pills . Only he kept walking around after he took them  --  until he fell over . The doctor thought at first that it was heart , but they had an autopsy . " He did not answer . She said in a low voice : " I know how you must feel , but these things  --  follow patterns . " " Yes , " he said , " they follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . A breeze had sprung up and it was full of whitecaps now . The tug had given up its pursuit of the freighter and had disappeared under the bluff . The Brodos ' place must be just back of him . Both those apartments had magnificent windows framing wide views of the river , a sluggish river , whose waters were so stained , so polluted by the works that went on on its banks that it presented to the very clouds that hovered above it a surface of the same color and impermeability as a sheet of gun metal . Ned Brodo had lain there for a year , on a bed . made of the intertwined gilded bodies of swans , looking out on this same river.  |p218Claiborne  looked over at the pretty , red-haired young woman who , for the past hour , had been sitting beside his desk , takingdown in a shorthand which she said she had invented for herself , the letters he was dictating . " That about does it , does n't it ? " he asked . She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " There are two more that seem fairly urgent . " " It all depends on what you call urgent , " Claiborne said , frowning , as he opened the first letter . " Here 's Jim Wrdgge wants me to write something about Joe Solmes 's new book . Does n't he know I 'm a wage slave ? I have n't got time to read that baloney of Joe Solmes , much less write about it . . . . Tell him I have n't read the book and I 'm not going to . It 's the same old baloney , only sliced thicker . " Then , hurriedly , as he saw a tremor on her soft lips ( she had once taken a course in creative writing with Joe Solmes at the advanced women 's college she had attended ) : " No , do n't tell him anything . That can go into TWAT . " Miss Golightly silently opened a drawer and drew from it a folder which had printed on it in large capitals : LTWATILALE . Claiborne , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his correspondence : LETTERS THAT WILL ANSWER THEMSELVES IF LEFT ALONE LONG ENOUGH and LETTERS MUST . " I bet those other letters can go into TWAT too , " he said now . A faint color showed in Miss Golightly 's cheek . " One 's from Mr. Elton . He says he was editor of his college maga-zine. "  | " Then he 's out , as far as I 'm concerned , " Claiborne said . " Tell him I 'm sorry but I ca n't recommend anybody for a Rhodes scholarship who 's ever been editor of a student publication . If he spent his time in college editing he wo n't have had time to learn anything . No use sending him to Oxford . He 'd only clutter up the place . " There was a moment 's silence as each of them recalled that one of the reasons Miss Golightly had been chosen as his secretary was that she had been editor of her college literary magazine . " Make it a nice letter , Miss Golightly , " he said uneasily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other one is from a Miss Pollard . " " Miss Pollard ! What does she want ? " " She wants an interview  --  for a nun who is writing a critical biography of Horne Watts . " He stretched out his hand for the letter : Dear Tom Claiborne Catherine Pollard wrote : Do you remember when I saw you that I told you about my friend Sister Immaculata , who is writing about Horne Watts ? Sister Immaculata is on leave this year from St. Mary on the Mount , where she is head of the English Department , and has a grant from the Collier Foundation for this work . She has been staying at a convent near us in order to be able to talk with me about my memories of Horne . The illness of one of her colleagues has cut her time short , but she is anxious to talk with you before she leaves . It would be a great convenience to her if she could see you within the next few days . Could you possibly come to our place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that time is not convenient for you will you set a time that is convenient ? Yours sincerely in Christ , CatherineShe called him " Tom Claiborne " but signed herself " Catherine " as if she were a queen . " Friday ! " he said . " Why , that 's today . "  | " I ca n't get down there , " he said . " Why , I would n't have time to get down there by four o'clock . " She glanced at her watch . " It 's quarter of four now . " He handed her the letter . " Tell her I 'm sorry I could n't make it . . . and tell her I 'll be glad to try to get together with Sister Immaculata some other time if she 'll arrange the rendezvous . " A little laugh escaped her . " Mr. Claiborne , what sort of biography do you suppose a nun would write about Home Watts ? " " A God-awful one , " he said abstractedly . " Oh , I love his poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Did you know him well ? " He looked up and saw in her bright hazel eyes a gleani he had come to know and dread . " Like a book , " he said . " Now you run along . . . . You might get that letter to Miss Pollard off this afternoon . " When she had left , giving him an only faintly reproachful glance as she gathered up her notebook and papers , he got up and walked over to the window and stood looking down on the street . He made it a point of honor to stay in the office until four o'clock every afternoon but it was getting harder to do every day . During the last few days the office had seemed almost unendurable . Was that because he was not , after all , very good at the job ? Or , at least , not good at the details that make up such a large part of such a job . A note to Jim Wragge , written in the wrong tone , could very well offend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and God knew what effect his refusal to recommend him for a Rhodes scholarship might have on the Elton boy . And yet he could not answer personally every letter that came to him . He wondered if the work would go better if he had another secretary . He had looked over some letters that were going out the other day and had found himself assuring an eminent British author that he was grateful for his " copperation . " Miss Golightly could not be depended upon to spell any word of more than one syllable properly , could not punctuate a simple declara/tive sentence , and knew the works of Aeschylus ( she spelled it Escylus ) , Sophocles , Euripides , Homer , Vergil , Tibullus , Catullus , Pliny , and Aristophanes only by hearsay , but she had a passion for trisyllables of Latin or Greek derivation . Was she , perhaps , taking desperate measures to remedy her lack of a classical education , as Southern poor whites sometimessupplement an insufficient diet by eating clay from some riverbank ? But if she did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles of the chief works of every well-known contemporary American and British poet , novelist , and critic and called some of them by their first names ; the advanced women 's college from which she had been graduated  --  withthe degree of Bachelor of Arts !  --  had apparently kept a procession of famous men and women passing through its student lounges . He sometimes fancied that he himself was only cooling his heels in an anteroom dedicated to some postgraduate course in which Miss Golightly was enrolled , so persistently did she quiz him about his literary acquaintance . What she was after , of course , was what women like her were always after : the artist en pantoufles , only nowadays they were n't satisfied to have him served up en pantoufles . They wanted him in the buff . " Bough " she would probably spell it . Sometimes , at night , when he could not sleep , he found himself writing expository prose , using Miss Golightly 's spellingand locutions . She had confided to him on the first day that she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too lazy to study any of the established methods and too vain to acknowledge that she lacked the professional equipmentfor her job . He had told Bill Pettigrew that she was too ignorant to discharge the duties of a secretary satisfactorily . Bill had expressed surprise . She had been a classmate of his sister 's at Gertrude Newman 's , he said , and had graduated summa cum laude . He had advised Claiborne to keep her . " You might get a girl from Leonard , " he had said . " So I might ! God save me ! " Claiborne had returned . It must already be past the hour . During the last few min/utes the throng of people pouring out onto the street had swelled perceptibly . This building occupied almost half of a city block and thrust the blunt tower in which his office was located God knew how many feet into the sky . High enough to dwarf the figures he was looking down on . Almost every figure hesitated a second as it reached the threshold of the building , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast now that it filled the whole sidewalk . . . . And boomerangon the dark tide to amber islands in the wave . . . The bow of the boat from which Horne had dived would have been about the same height as this tower in which he himself now stood , and Horne , when he jumped , might have thought of himself as a missile , which would return to the hand that launched it  --  there had been an interval , they said , during which he threshed about in the water , calling for help . But there had been no return , and no amber island . . . unless you call the belly of a shark an island  --  the captain had seen two of them closing in on him . . . . He had tried to talk Horne out of " boomerang " in that poem ; having no formal education , Horne never scrupled to use a noun for a verb any time it suited him , having that much , at least , in common with Miss Golightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream was sent , /Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore . Keep that Gertrude Newman stuff up long enough and they 'll make Lesbians out of the lot of them . . . But it was nuns who were rending the gory visage now ! The doings , doubtless , of that strange , large woman that George Crenfew 's flighty young wife had turned into . Odd to think of her associating with nuns , or not so odd , perhaps . In the old days she had always been off on some mystic quest . Once she and Horne and Joe Paster had kept a jarful of rainwater sitting around the studio for days while they added this or that to it according to some formula of black magic they had got out of an old book . . . . He looked at his watch . It was only ten minutes past four . If he left the office now he still had time to go down to Mottp223Street and talk to that nun before Cynthia would expect him  --  long enough to knock some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , " the driver said . Claiborne saw a three-story house that many years ago had been painted white . Between the house and the curb a gray , unwieldy serpent crawled : unshaved men in ragged , grimy clothes were forming a line around the corner and marching up to the old mansion . It had a stoop a little elevated above the street . The soup kitchen was evidently located in the basement beneath the stoop ; the serpentine line flowed steadily until it came abreast of the stoop when it wavered and coiled back upon itself before it slid out of sight down the steps . Ever since Claiborne 's cab had pulled up at the curb a few minutes ago , the men had been shuffling up to the house , three and four abreast . They came in silence , for the most part , and most of them looked straight ahead as they walked , though now and then some younger man , whose eyes kept roving over the faces of his companions as if he were surprised to find himself among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emitting a short laugh , say something in a low voice to which the older man did not always respond . There was one man who had attracted Claiborne 's attention when he first came in sight at the corner  --  a tall man who carriedhimself with a kind of jauntiness  --  or was it only that he moved with exaggerated lightness , as if he had a fearful care for his very bones ? He was neatly dressed in a dark , worn suit . The battered gray hat that rode high on the back of his head might have been the hat a man in comfortable circumstances clings to because he likes the way it feels onp224his head , if its inner rim had not been so darkly stained with sweat . The driver turned around . " Well , Mac . . . ? " he said . " Wait a minute , " Claiborne told him . He had lost sight of the tall man as the line undulated back and forth and had just caught sight of him again , poised at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the first step down into the soup kitchen . He was older than Claiborne had thought ; the black hair under the battered hat was rimed with silver , the stubble on the chin white . The man realized that he was being observed and turned his head . A pair of bleak gray eyes rested on Claiborne'sface , the man 's mouth stretched in a grin wide enough to reveal discolored stubs of teeth before he lounged with his dreadful lightness down the stairs and out of sight . " Ma . . . ac ! " the driver said . " You want me to break through that line ? " Claiborne asked roughly . " It 's the only way you 'll ever get through it . . . . But it 's all right with me , you want to sit here and run the meter up . " A short man in a dirty plaid cap , who , for some minutes , had been standing opposite the cab , staring at its occupants out of a pair of protruding pale blue eyes , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go right through , mister . It ai n't going to cost us nothing , " he said , and began ostentatiouslymaking a gap in the ranks . Claiborne got out of the cab after tossing the driver a bill , ascended the short flight of steps . The front door of the house was ajar . He pushed it open and found himself in a narrow , ill-lit hall . There was a long stairway at the rear of it and several doors opening off each side of it . The clicking of a typewriter came from behind a door on the left side of the hall . Behind a door on the right a woman 's voice soared in sharp syllables above a child 's wailing . Claiborneslowly set his foot on the match with which he had just lighted his cigarette . . . . There was no real resemblance . That man 's eyes were gray . My father 's eyes werep225brown . Darker than mine . . . . The dirty hall seemed to echo with the laughter that of late he heard wherever he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Voice said . " But you are right . It was not his eyes , it was the way he moved . . . . The way your father used to move . . . . Was it for the same reason ? " Standing alone in the narrow hall , the tall man shook his lowered head from side to side , like a beast beset by hornets . " I did n't come here to listen to you . . . . God knows I can talk to you anywhere . At the office . At home . " " At home ? " the Voice said . " Where is your home ? " " I mean where I hang my hat , " he said savagely , " that 's home to me . " " Hat ! " the Voice cried . " Hat ! He has a hat , too ! " And the laughter rose so loud and shrill that Claiborne looked about him uneasily , fearing that somebody might come into the hall and discover his plight . The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's reprimand . He knocked on the door on the left . When no answer came he pushed the door open and entered a room which was evidently a newspaper editorial office ; two or three old-fashioned roll-top desks stood in a litter of discarded copy paper and a long rack at the far end of the room was heaped with newspapers . A young man who wore a green eye shade sat at a desk facing the door . In the far end of the room a shabby old man was bent over the rack which held newspapers . The young man looked up as Claiborne entered , fixing on him the blank gaze of a person who acknowledges an interruption but whose attention is elsewhere . Claiborne did not speak immediately . The young man gazed at him and said : " How do you spell eschatological ' ? " " With an h , " Claiborne said . The young man smiled happily . " Good thing you came in . I was going to leave out the h . We had a dictionary around here but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mind  --  except when I 'm working on an encyclical . . . . What did you say you wanted ? " " I have an appointment with Miss Pollard . "  | " You 'll have a hard time catching her . She might be over at the chapel . . . . They 've all gone wild over the chapel . Anybody else do ? " " I was to meet a nun here named Sister Immaculata . " " Is she a Little Sister ? " " I do n't know her order . " " Those Little Sisters are in and out of here all day . . . . Say , why do n't you go across the hall and ask Eileen ? She keeps up with those people . " " I will , " Claiborne said , and was turning toward the door when a sound from the other end of the room made him pause . The old man was standing up , holding a newspaper in his hand and shaking his head from side to side , and mutteringwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with him ? " Claiborne asked curiously . " That 's Joseph Tardieu , " the young man said , not without a note of pride in his voice . He added in a lower tone , " SometimesI wish it 'd been his eyes that gave out instead of his brain . Every time he reads a newspaper he sees something that sets him off . " The old man growled and , flinging the newspaper down into the rack , lurched toward them , pulling a greasy notebookand a stub of pencil out of his pocket as he came . The young man groaned . " He 's on his way , " he said . " Where 's he going ? " Claiborne asked . " He 's not going anywhere , " the young man said grimly , " but he thinks he 's going up to Union Square . " " What for ? " " To talk to the men . Give ' em the true doctrine . That 's what he 's been doing for thirty years  --  till his brain gave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may have another one any time now . Catherine does n't think he ought to go out on the street by himself . . . . Say , brother , you could n't keep him a few minutes ? I 've got to get this copy in . " He laid his hand on the old man 's arm . " Listen , Pere , here 's a fellow wants to talk to you . " The old man stood looking from one to the other , breath/ing heavily . " What does he want to talk to me about ? " he asked in a foreign accent . The young man was already seated at his desk . " About Chesterton and Belloc , " he said , and gave Claiborne a mischievousglance . " Chesterton and Belloc is fine , " the old man said , " bud it dakes more than dose two . It dakes Christ . " He walked back to his seat beside the newspaper rack and sat down and , resting his hands on his spread knees , leaned toward Claiborne . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The world , " Claiborne said , " and the flesh  --  and the Devil . " Joseph Tardieu nodded , staring at Claiborne out of redrimmedblue eyes . " He will trouble you more before he 's through , " he said . " Who ? " " The Devil . . . . You read St. Augustine ? " " Off and on . . for years . " " Who told you to read St. Augustine ? " " I started reading him in college and kept it up . " " I read him in college too . L'Universite de Grenoble . . . . He looked away from Claiborne , shaking his head . " I was at Grenoble . I know that . Now I 'm here . " He leaned still fartherforward . " You know how I got here ? " " Probably worked your way over on a cattle boat , " Claibornesaid . The old man laughed delightedly . " The Holland What You Call Him Line . Fifty cows and one hundred sheep . And we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , but Joseph Tardieu , he do n't mind a little cow manure . Good for the land , cow manure . . . . " He looked back at Claiborne . " You on that boat ? " Claiborne shook his head . " I was in college at the time . Reading St. Augustine . " The old man laughed . " You sit up all night , " he said , " and you read St. Augustine . . . . Maybe you read St. Thomas too . . . St. Bonaventura . . . but you do n't listen . " Hep228held a dirty , stubby forefinger up . " You listen more , you read better . " " What should I listen for ? " Claiborne asked . The smile widened on the old man 's face . " Dat little child . De one St. Augustine heard . You remember what dat little child say ? " " He said : Tolle , lege , ' " Claiborne said slowly . The old man nodded , his red-rimmed blue eyes twinkling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do dat now ! " The young man was coming toward them . " I do thank you , brother , " he said . " You 've sure got the touch . He 's quiet as a lamb . " Claiborne got to his feet , put out his hand . " Thank you for a most interesting conversation , Mr. Tardieu , " he said . Tardieu nodded again . " You come back ? " " The first chance I get , " Claiborne said , and to the young man : " Who did you say might know where Sister Immaculate is ? " " Eileen , " the young man said . " She knows who 's coming and going . " " Where is she ? " " In the clothes room . Across the hall . " " Thanks , " Claiborne said , then lingered a second with his hand on the doorknob . " What are you writing ? " he asked . " I 'm just working on one of the Pope 's locutions today . But I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up tonight . I have to do it by myself . Tom 's helping with the chapel . Takes a whole crew to get those panels up . " He sat down at his desk and began rapidly typing away with two fingers . Claiborne crossed the hall and knocked on the door opposite . It opened immediately . A fat , dark woman stood behind a long table which was heaped high with garments . Children of various ages and sizes were ranged on a long bench fixed against the wall . A little girl in a bright red dress was parading up and down in the space between the table and the door.  |p229The  woman stared at him out of beady black eyes , then looked away and said indifferently , " Zhee crezzy for it . But too shot . Too shot for Lila . Zhee grow vast , I tell you . " The little girl clutched the bright fabric with each hand . " No , Mama , no ! " she cried . " Tess , " the woman said stolidly . " Too shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small sound and a slim , black-haired girl stepped out from behind the door , gesturing toward an inner room . " The men 's room is in there , " she said . " Would you mind waiting a minute  --  till Mrs. Costa 's finished picking out the clothes for the children ? " " I do n't want the men 's room , " Claiborne said , " I 'm looking for a nun named Immaculata . " The girl blushed . " Oh ! . . . Sister Immaculata ? She 's in the library . Two doors down . On this side of the hall . " Claiborne was silent a moment , then he said , " Would you mind showing me the way ? - There are so many doors in this hall . " She hesitated and looked at the Puerto Rican woman . " Iss oll right , " Mrs. Costa said gloomily , " but oll of them too shot . " The girl emitted a sigh as they started down the hall . " They 're all like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you get many Puerto Ricans ? " " I should say we do . They come here to be outfitted from top to toe , complaining every minute , of course . " " All the clothes too shot ? " She laughed . " When they 're not too lung . But that 's not what 's really annoying . What 's really annoying is that they have n't the least idea that we 're Catholics too . All the time they 're taking the clothes they 're looking down on us for being pagans ! " " That must be hard to take ! " They had arrived before another door . She put her hand on the knob . She was a pretty girl , with Irish coloring , wearing a round-collared white blouse and a blue skirt . It wasp230strange how different the hall seemed when she stood there , with her hand on the doorknob . He said quickly : " I have a young friend who works here . In your clothes room , I be-lieve . " " Desiree ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in charge of the clothes room . I 'm just substituting for her  --  that 's why I made the mistake about you . " She laughed and he laughed too . " Where is Desiree ? " he asked . " Over at the chapel . It 's her friend who 's doing the mural , so of course she 's over there a lot . And I 'm glad to have a chance to learn the ropes in the clothes room . We all change jobs , anyhow , every so often , you know  --  all except Ed Billow . Nobody can do his work . " " Why is that ? " " Nobody knows as much as he does  --  except Joseph Tardieu , of course . And he could n't write anything  --  now . " " What is this work of Ed Billow 's ? " " Theology , " she said gravely . " He writes on the Pope 's encyclicals . At least that 's what he mostly writes about . " " The old party , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? " She nodded . " He 's been that way for over a year . The doctorsays it 's arteriosclerosis . It 's settled in his brain . Catherine says we should expect that . " " You mean he 's always been a little touched ? " " Oh , no ! " she said earnestly . " He was very brilliant , and taught Catherine and Ed Billow all they know . But he stripped himself to put on Christ till his brain was all he had left . Catherine says that naturally he has to offer that to God too before he dies . " She opened the door , calling out cheerfully : " Sister Immaculata , here 's someone to see you . " An old nun was seated at one end of a long table , with many papers spread out before her . A sharp-featured little man in ragged clothes sat at the other end , reading a copy of Pic . The nun raised her head and stared at Claiborne overp231the rims of her spectacles . Suddenly her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleboorne ? " she cried . " I 've been crazy to meet you  --  ever since I read some of your letters to our boy . It was good of ye to come today . " " Not at all , " Claiborne said politely . " I was anxious to see you too  --  as soon as I found out that you were writing a book about my friend . " The girl had disappeared . Sister Immaculata gestured toward the window where a much smaller nun sat in a rocking chair reading a breviary " Me parrtner , Sister Perpetua , " she said , " and this "  --  she indicated the sharp-featured man , then paused . " What did ye say your name was , me man ? " " Joe Fagan , " the bum said in a hoarse voice . Sister Immaculata compressed her lips and shook her head slightly . " So now ye know all of us . Sit down . " Sister Perpetua , who had acknowledged Claiborne 's presenceonly by a silent bow , had returned to her reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked as he took a chair opposite Sister Immaculata . The old nun ( she had three stiff , white hairs growing out of a big mole on the left side of her nostril ) leaned across the table , wheezing with suppressed laughter . " She 's not me collaborator , she 's me chaperone . We go about in pairs  --  it 's better in case of trouble . " She cast a glance at the oblivious Joe Fagan . Claiborne eyed with apprehension the leathern cincture about her waist , as wide and as stout as a horse 's girth . A memory from his childhood came to him : there had been at Eupedon a certain gray mare , Bessie , who made a practice of swelling up when her " belly-band " was cinched , so that one could never ride her as much as a quarter of a mile without having to dismount and recinch it , an arduous procedurewhen one was a small boy and was only just learning to mount from the ground . He dismissed as irreverent the fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinched her girth , and said : " It is n't too hot inp232here for you , Sister ? " for she was fanning herself rapidly with her left hand . " No , no , " she wheezed . " It 's me bronchial tubes . . . . Delightfulin here , is n't it ? " and she gave a rapid glance at the walls which were lined with books . " But we must n't waste time . I 've many questions to ask ye , and maybe some things to tell ye too , for I flatter meself I 've found out some things about our boy not known to everybody . " She shook her large head , frowning . " Ah , there 's me pride rearing itself up ! An ugly sight now , is n't it . . . ? But why write a book if ye ca n't say something that 's not been said before ? " " We 'd be spared a lot of suffering if every critic subscribed to that , " Claiborne said . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blood , " she said . " Companions in the Blood , " he repeated . " I see ye do n't get the point . Have ye never read the Divino Dialogo of St. Catherine of Siena ? " He shook his head . She lowered her head and regarded him over the rims of her spectacles again , but abstractedly , as if he had not as yet engaged her full attention . He found himselfglad that this was the case ; she had an eye rather like a gamecock 's , fierce yet clouded , as it were , by an inner light . She nodded suddenly , as if she had received an answer to her question . " I thought as much , " she said , and swept all of the folders except three off the table and into a brief case . The three folders were conspicuously labeled : MAGIC , BLOOD , and BRIDGE . She was opening the one labeled MAGIC . " Will ye read that now ? " she asked . He read : Jurain , Hyle and Coahyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lateinischen in das Teusche translatiret und ubergesetzt durch D. Johann Ella Muller . ( Hamburg 1732 ) . The most recent account comes from a treatise alleged to have been translated from Ethiopian into Latin and from Latin into German , of which Ch . VIII , " The Creation , " reads : P233Take common rain water a good quantity , at least ten quarts , preserve it well sealed in glass vessel for at least ten days , then it will deposit matter and feces on the bottom . Pour off the clear liquid and place it in a wooden vessel that is fashioned round like a ball , cut it in the middle and fill the vessel a third full , and set it in the sun about midday in a secret or secluded spot . When this has been done , take a drop of consecrated red wine and let it fall into the water , and you will instantly perceive a fog and thick darkness on top of the water , such as also was at the first creation . Then put in two drops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness ; whereupon little by little put in every half of each quarter hour first three , then four , then five , then six drops , and then no more , and you will see with your own eyes one thing after another appearing by and by on top of the water , how God created all things in six days , and how it all came to pass , and such secrets as are not to be spoken aloud and I also have not power to reveal . Fall on your knees before you undertake this operation . Let your eyes judge of it ; for thus was the world created . Let all stand as it is , and in half an hour after it began it will disappear . By this you will see clearly the secrets of God , that are at present hidden from you as from a child . You will understand what Moses has written concerning the creation ; you will see what manner of body Adam and Eve had before and after the Fall , what the serpent was , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where and what Paradise is , and in what bodies the righteous shall be resurrected ; not in this body that we have receivedfrom Adam , but in that which we attain through the Holy Ghost , namely in such a body as our Saviour brought from Heaven . He looked up into her sparkling eyes . He said : " I 'm damned ! . . . I mean , why , that must be the very formula they were using ! " She had crossed herself at the profane word but her brilliantgaze did not waver . " The secrets of God , " she said . " It 's what we 're all after . . . . Catherine says she does n't knowp234whether the wine was consecrated or not . Would ye be knowingthat now ? " " I 'll bet it was , " he said after a moment 's hesitation . " Horne would have insisted on that . He was very particular  --  in his strange way . . . . Joe Paster ! " he added excitedly . " Joe Paster was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have got the wine for Horne . He was friends with a lot of priests around there .

Horne and Joe were having an affair that winter and they would n't let Max Shull in on their magic . I came by the studio once and he was standing outside , crying . We both set our shoulders to the door and broke it in and found ' em all on their knees . Horne gave me the devil . Said I 'd ruined everything . . . . " He paused in confusion . " Pxclise me , Sister . I got carried away on this flood of reminiscence . " " Ye 're probably in a state of invincible ignorance , " she said mildly , " but ye ought not to take the Lord 's  --  or the Devil 's  --  name in vain . Have ye prayed about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not much on prayer . . . . What does Catherine Pollard think about all this ?

" " They took a roundabout way of getting at ' em . " " Ah , magic is always roundabout ! " " It was n't the black magic alone , " he said . " It was the companythey kept . Some rather unsavory characters went in and out of that studio , Sister . . . this Joe Paster , for instance  --  I ought not to mention that fellow 's name in your presence . " " Catherine says he was a Catholic . " " Why , yes , of sorts . Used to fall on his knees in the middle of the street . Had to acknowledge the visitation whenever it came , he said . "  |p235She  looked at him sternly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I doubt very much that the Holy Ghost ever visited that fellow , Sister . He was a notorious homosexual . Used to go out with the boys every night and then get up and go to confessionevery morning . " She shook her head sadly . " A hard struggle he must have had . . . . Catherine thinks the Lord made a mighty use of him  --  in showing Horne the wonders of the Blood . " " The blood ! " he exclaimed . " Horne had an affair with this fellow and they used to nick each other with knives  --  if that 's what you mean by the blood ! " She nodded calmly and picked up the folder marked BLOOD . " It 's that I wanted to talk with ye about . Catherine thinks that in the last years of his life Horne was drawing near to the Blood . " He said slowly : " Sister , as you know , Horne spent his last days in France . I saw him frequently and he evidently underwenta period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An erotic craving for blood was one of his symptoms . Miranda Proctor wrote me that when he visited her she had to ask her gardener to keep his fourteen-year-old boy out of the way ; Horne attackedhim once , with a knife . I 've got a letter somewhere in which he says that he suspects that his powers are failing but that he feels that they would come back  --  if only he could see blood . Enough blood was the way he put it . " She sighed deeply . " Ah , yes . Enough to inebriate him . That 's all he asked for . That 's all any of us ask for . Enough of the Blood of Christ to inebriate us . " " Horne asked for about a quart of whisky a day too , " he said . " I come from the Old Country , " she said . " The men of me family are all drunkards . It takes a power of whisky to still a man 's longing for the Blood of Christ . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homosexuals than it does ordinary men , " he said with a laugh.  | " They 've an extraordinary longing for it , " she said , " and a place in the Kingdom . Our Lord Himself said the last word on that : Some men are born eunuchs , some men are made eunuchs by men and some become eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of God . " Even while the words stirred echoes in his memory they swelled the rising tide of his impatience . With an effort , he controlled it , saying : " Sister , it 's immensely interesting to talk with you , but you must understand that there are certain aspects of these men 's lives . . . " That ye ca n't talk about with a nun ? " she said with a laugh . " I 've not had the experience of the flesh that yell doubtless have had , but you must remember that a nun is a woman too . . . . I left the world when I was twenty-one . The first flush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a few lads after me . There was one  --  I wo n't tell ye how far we went , but many 's the morning  --  and , mind ye , after I took me simple vows  --  many 's the morning I 've waked up and the feeling that he 'd been lying beside me the night would be so strong that I 'd put this hand "  --  she extended toward him her large , work-roughened finger on which she wore a plain gold ring  --  " this hand , with its bridal ring , I 'd lay down on the pillow where his head would have lain the night . . . . " After you went into the convent you realized what you were missing ? " he said with a laugh . She sighed . " Every human soul is different from every other human soul . But all human hearts are the same . Desperatelywicked the prophet Jeremias calls the human heart and St. Augustine tells us we are not responsible for the first movements ' of the heart . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Armed with the sayings of these worthies , you doubtless had no trouble in lying down and sleeping , " he said in a voice which he allowed to become tinged with irony . " Till I was around thirty , " she said simply . " The temptationsof me flesh became really terrible then . . . . But I hadp237the grace of a good confessor . ' Not a wink of sleep , Sister ? ' he 'd say , ' God must love ye , indeed , to grant you so much concupiscence ! ' . . . Catherine tells me that these gels she has working with her here are much the same . The twenty- year-old gels have no trouble with the custody of their eyes . It 's the gel who has turned thirty who plays the devil among the men with her sidewise looks . . . . " How long did these temptations of the flesh assail you , Sister ? " he asked curiously . " Till I was well past fifty . But praise be , that 's over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes . " He said : " I 'm much interested in all you say , Sister , but we are talking , after all , about the temptations that beset normal men and women . Horne Watts and his intimates are a differentmatter . I do n't think you realize what these men 's lives were like . They were not tempted carnally by women but by their fellow men . The relations between Horne and this Joe Paster were a travesty of the relationship between a man and a woman which I , for one , could n't stomach . . . . She said with something like his own impatience : " And what makes you think that you  --  or I  --  are so much better than they were ? When it comes to love , we 're all like eunuchs in the presence of the Bridegroom . Husbands and wives , priests , monks , nuns . . . It 's the Blood that matters . Read this , will ye ? " and she pushed toward him the folder marked BLOOD . He opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucified , and bathe yourself in the blood ; inebriate yourself with the blood , and clothe yourself with the blood . If you have been unfaithful , baptizeyourself again in the blood ; if the demon has darkened the eye of your understanding , wash it in the blood . . . . Dissolve your tepidity in the heat of the blood , and cast off your darkness in the light of the blood . . . . I wish to strip myself of every raiment which I have worn up to now . I crave for blood ; in the blood have I satisfied and shall satisfy my soul . I was deceived when I sought her among creatures ; so am I fain , in time of solicitude , to meet companions in the blood . Thus shall I findp238the blood and creatures , and I shall drink their affection and love in the blood . He sat staring at the page after he had finished . " Ye see , " she said , " she craved blood too ! " " Who is she ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Saint Catherine of Siena , to Blessed Raimondo . Her Son and Father she called him . " He looked down at the page again . " From the Divino Dialogo , " he read . She compressed her lips . " They call ye a great writer and ye 've never read the Divino Dialogo ! " " I write very little , " he said , " and what I write is not great . " " Ah , it 's hard to tell whether that 's pride or humility speaking there  --  but thank God , it 's not for me to judge . " Joe Fagan , who for some minutes had been observing them with mournful attentiveness , now laid his magazine down and walked slowly from the room . When the door had closed behind him , Sister Immaculata leaned across the table . " Did ye see anything in his coat pocket ? " she asked in a whisper . " A pint bottle of whisky , " Claiborne said . She heaved a sigh and crossed herself , then pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the poor soul 's way , but it 's hard for me not to be glad he 's got his whisky for the day . I 've an undue attachment to good books , God forgive me , and many 's the time I 've begged her not to put her fine books out on those shelves . Do you think she 'll listen ? Sister , ' she 'll say , suppose one of the men wanted to read Blessed Angela of Foligno or Brother John the Evangelist'sKingdom of God in the Soul ? " Not likely , ' I tell her , as long as they 've got Pic and Look . ' She had her way and Blessed Angela of Foligno went last Thursday . . . . " She drew the corners of her large , mobile mouth down and made the gesture of whipping a book off a shelf and into a coatp239pocket . " The Kingdom of God in the Soul is still there if ye 'd care to take a look at it . " " I 'd rather talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Ah , we 've so much to talk about ! " she said , and drew another of her folders toward her . " Pontifex , ' now . Catherine tells me ye argued against his taking that title . " He said : " It seemed to me that no man-made mechanism could stand up under the weight of the imagery he hung on that bridge . And who , after all , is his Pontifex ' ? " " It 's that I wanted to talk with ye about . Do ye suppose he 'd ever read the Divino Dialogo of St. Catherine ? " " I 'm sure he had n't . He had no formal education , and was ill read . Not as well read as I am , as a matter of fact . " " It 's easy to see ye 're a man of parts . How ye 'll shine once your true worth is revealed ! " " Do you mean after I 'm dead ? " he asked with an embarrassedlaugh . " Ah , it may happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystical body now , invisible as ye are . How ye 'll shine when ye become visible ! " " Do you mean that if I should join the Church I 'd become visible ? " he asked curiously . " What else could I mean ? Where 's your theology , man ? " " I have n't got any theology , " he said . " It 's a bad time  --  a time of Occam , not Aquinas . . . . Did ye ever read Marsiglio of Padua ? " He shook his head . " He writes about the same thing they write about today : the self-sufficiency of the natural man and the exaltation of the state that always goes along with it . Existentialism we call it today . He was much read in Siena in the fourteenth century . . . . Now here 's a thought for ye . Siena was a great city and produced many saints  --  saints were the glories of cities in those days . But along with the saints it produced more homosexualsthan other cities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , the more ye study his life , the more ye are reminded of hers . Both of them born into a bad time , and with no education . Catherine tells me that he did n't even graduate from the high school . " " No , " he said . " He was almost completely self-taught . " " Taught the same way she was taught ! Do ye know how she learned to read ? " He shook his head . " It was God Himself Who taught her , so her heart that He had filled with love might not burst . Ah , was Blessed Raimondosurprised when he got her first letter ! " " Who was Blessed Raimondo ? " " He was a man , maybe like our Horne . . . . " You mean that he was homosexual ? " " No . He had other failings . God had given him a great heart by nature but it all turned into pride and anger on the natural level . He had to be lifted above himself  --  like Horne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a way in her arms . " She gazed at him earnestly . " Does it make any difference what gifts or burdens a man has as long as he lays them all at the feet that were nailed to the cross ? " Her gaze was too bright . He felt as if he had been out in blazing sunshine too long . He left her question unanswered and stared out of the window . They must have stopped servingsoup and bread downstairs . In the dingy square across the street a few men  --  men who had probably been standing in line only a few minutes ago  --  were sitting on benches . One of them was reading a newspaper that he must have salvaged from a gutter ; it had a great brown splotch zigzagging across it . A long time ago , in a wood a long way from here , Vera had picked up off the ground just such a sodden newspaper . As Claiborne watched , a man on the other end of the bench leaned forward and picking a cigarette butt out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remember when he had been in this part of the city before , but Horne would have come here often . " Those fellows in Times Square are too natty , " he had told Claiborne once , adding that some/times after a party he liked to go down to a place like Mott Street " to see what was going on . " Homosexuality had not been as fashionable in literary circles when he was alive as it is today , and he had despised " pansies . " His intimates were all those whom he had " weighed in the balance and found wanting . " Toward the last most of them stopped inviting him to parties ; he invariably arrived drunk and the gaiety that had once been so spontaneous and hence contagious had turned febrile . He was preoccupied with sex and would look about a room , muttering obscenities , speculating in a hoarse and audible undertone on the sexual ties and habits of the other guests , and often as midnight approached would reel off in a drunken frenzy to find in some squalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedfellow for the night . A creature must go to earth somewhere , or had he been rovingall this time and only now gone to earth  --  in the cracked brain of an old nun ? " Ye say he never read the Divino Dialogo  --  and I do n't doubt ye  --  but tell me then , where did he get his notion of the bridge ? The same notion she had . " " Why ca n't you leave him alone ? " he cried . " The poor devil 's dead ! And he hated women all his life . Why ca n't you women leave him alone . . . . What are you laughing at ? "  --  for her old face was suddenly crinkled all over with laughter . She had got her handkerchief out and was wiping the tears from her eyes . " It 's the mercy of God , " she said . " It takes me that way sometimes . . . . Ye are n't angry with me ? " " No , " he said sulkily , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bones . " " It 's the bridge , " she said . " It 's because he wrote about the bridge . Catherine says he could never live far from it . . . . " " Because there are hangouts for sailors in that neighborhood and he could pick the sailors up as they came off the boats . " " It was the Humanity of the Word kept him there , " she said . " It 's the Humanity of the Word is the bridge between earth and heaven . And it has three steps : the feet that werep242nailed to the cross , the side that was pierced to reveal the ineffable love of the heart , and the mouth in which gall and vinegar were turned to sweetness . Horne ran to and fro among creatures like a madman , but he ran along the bridge too , else how could he have brought back the stones of virtuethat he planted in his garden ? " " He took his own life , " he said . " Is n't that a sin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cast himself into it in the end . We all have our own ways of abandoning ourselves to God 's mercy . " " You think , then , that because he was a gifted poet God will forgive him for taking his own life ? " She did not seem to consider his question worth answering . The interview was evidently at an end ; she had set her brief case on the table between them and was stowing her folders away in it . All at once she raised her head . The smile on her old , wise , kind face was like a lantern set out on a dark night . " Who can tell what God will do ? " she asked . " All we know is that He is mad with love for His creature and drunk with desire for her salvation . When we flee Him fastest may be when He seeks us most . " She came out from behind the table and settling her voluminousskirts picked up her brief case . " Sister Perpetua , " she called , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perpetua came forward and the three of them went silently down the hall . As Claiborne held the outer door open , Sister Immaculata turned to him : " Yell be coming to the chapel with me to say a prayer for our boy . " " I 'm afraid not , Sister . I 'm due uptown now . " " Ye wo n't find a better time to pray for him than now , " she said calmly . But he could not answer her for staring at the man who was coming up the street.  |p243Max  saw him and stopped dead . " Tom ! " he called . " What are you doing here ? " " What are you doing here ? " Claiborne countered . Sister Immaculata descended the steps and , followed by her smaller companion , moved majestically off down the street . As they passed him , Max bowed low and said , " Be seeing you , Sister , " and then came and stood at the foot of the steps , looking up at Claiborne . " I get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a talk with Sister Immaculata . " " I was summoned , " Claiborne said , " by either St. Catherine of Siena or St. Catherine Pollard  --  I have n't figured out which . " He looked after the retreating figure of Sister Immaculate . " I 'm not sure I 'd have come if I 'd known what I was letting myself in for . " Max turned and looked down the street too . " You 'd think she had one of those old-fashioned steamboat paddle wheels installed in her , would n't you . . . ? I do n't blame you , boy ! Was she very rough on you ? " " Not exactly rough , " Claiborne said . " Formidable . As formidable a woman as I ever met . " " I had a session with her when I first came , " Max said . " She turned me inside out in no time at all ! " " I thought nuns had to stay put , " Claiborne said . " What 's she doing roaming all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Max said . " D.Phil. of Louvain and all that . When you get to be that big a wheel you can pretty well do as you please , provided , of course , ye have the proper reverence for your superiors , and humility , which is the groundwork of all the virtues . She 's hell on humility . Has she given you her talk on humility yet ? "  | " We talked mostly about what a saintly fellow Horne Watts was and how much he resembled Blessed Raimondo Some-body . " " That 'd be one of the followers of St. Catherine of Siena . She 's death on St. Catherine . . . . But she 's got the whole Middle Ages at her finger tips . I wish I knew half as much as that woman . " His quick , black eyes had kept roving over Claiborne 's face as he talked and now he smiled , as if this meeting , which was taking place after months of separation and domestic upheaval , were a casual affair . " What say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little joint in the next block . " The " little joint " consisted of four tables in the back half of a delicatessen . The proprietor came out from behind the counter , wiping his hands on his apron when he saw them enter . Max called him " John " and told him he wanted the biggest mug he had of the " dark . " " Boy , am I thirsty ! " he said when the mugs of beer were set before them . John lingered behind Max 's chair a moment after he had brought the beer . " Thirsty work , " he said . " Look at painters ! Drink hair tonic or anything else they can get . . . . You been up on the scaffold ? " Max shook his head . " I 've been working at the lower level , but I 've had to climb up every now and then to give ' em a hand . . . . It 's no work for a fat man . " He glanced down at his middle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Claiborne eyed him curiously . Max certainly had not lost any weight but he had had the impression as they walked down the street together that he was moving more lightly than he had seen him move for years . There was an air of suppressed excitement about him too , an air of haste that he had never known him to have before . He said : " No , you have n't lost any weight that I can see , but you do n't seem to be feeling any pain . . . . What are you up to , Max ? What are you doing down here ? " " I 've got a commission , " Max said , " and such a commission ! It 's giving me a chance to fulfill a life 's ambition . Whenp245it 's finished I 'll be known the length and breadth of Mott Street as the Master of the St. Eustace legend . " " That 's what you were known as the length and breadth of the Riviera , " Claiborne said . Max shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a mural . And I 've got as nice a little apse to put it on as you 'd ask . The chapel was Greek Orthodoxonce , so it 's round as a barrel . Then some youth movementtook over but the president and treasurer of the society got involved in a holdup and went to the reformatory , so the board offered it to Catherine  --  on St. Eustace 's day , boy ! " " That 's the day she was at Blencker 's Brook last year . Did she ask you to decorate the chapel then ? " " She did n't know she had the chapel when she was at Blencker 's Brook but as soon as she got back here and heard the news she thought of me . . . . Where else could she find a master of the St. Eustace legend ? " " I rernember your telling me that she admired the version of it you had on display that day . . . . She has a discerning eye . " " That 's what you need in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little something else , " Claibornesaid . " She has n't got any money  --  ca n't be bothered with the stuff . But she knows where it grows . " " She 's paying you for this job ? " " I 'm making enough out of it to carry me for the next few months . " " Then you are n't living at Blencker 's Brook any more ? " Claiborne asked after a brief pause . Max shook his head . " There 's nobody at Blencker 's Brook  --  except Tom Abel and one of his men . " " Alice and Freda and all of ' em packed off ? " " On board wages . " There was another longer pause , then Claiborne asked bluntly : " Where is Vera ? " " I 'm not allowed to tell you , " Max said soberly.  | " You mean she told you not to tell me ? " Max nodded . " She does n't want you to know where she is . But I do n't see why I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " She 's all right , Tom ! I know you 've been worrying about her . " " How could I help it ? " " Of course . But you do n't need to worry about her any more . She 's all right . Better than she 's ever been , as a matter of fact . . . . Happier . . . . How 's Cynthia ? " " Her health is excellent . . . . I suppose you would n't feel like coming to see us ? " Max shook his head . " When two of my friends separate I make it a rule to take one side or the other . That way you do n't get caught in the cross fire . " " Very clever of you , " Claiborne said . There was a silence , then Max said , " Would you like to see the chapel ? " Claiborne said , " Sure , " and they set off down the street . The chapel , a round , squat structure built of ugly red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenement houses . The houses , swaying a little toward each other , from age and decrepitude , took on , for Claiborne 's fancy , the look of a couple of harridans engaging in conversation over the head of the stunted youth or dwarf whom they had taken in charge . It was dark inside except for a pinpoint of light far at the back and the light which came from several large electric bulbs , which , encased in wire cages , were laid along the edges of a canvas sheet that covered most of the floor . A scaffolding had been fixed beside one wall . Claiborne saw figures perched on its top plank . Three or four other figures moved about below the scaffolding or stood with their backs to him grouped around a stand that held a big tub . Max called , " Dessy , here 's Cousin Tom ! " and one of the figures detached itself from the group and came forward . There was something dedicated , almost nunlike in Desiree 's manner if not in her dress , Claiborne thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteered no explanation of her own presence there , merely stood beside him for a few minutes , staring at what was visible of the mural , then suddenly , with a wordless smile , went back to the group around the stand . " She stands there all day and stirs the stuff , " Max said . " We 're putting it on with rollers , so it has to be pretty thick . " " What are you using ? " " Oh , part Venice Turpentine , part white lead . It holds fine . " In the dim light several young men went to and fro , filling buckets from the tub and handing them to men who stood on the lower rungs of the platform , who , in turn , handed them to the men above them . As one of these men leaned down to receive a bucket from his helper , his face was clearly visible in the circle of light . Claiborne turned to Max . " What 's Robin Vincent doing up there ? " " Why , he bosses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got a natural knack . . . . You know , his painting'scoming along like nobody 's business . I 'll show you something he 's just finished ' . . . . " " I thought it was sculpture he excelled in , " Claiborne said . " That was months ago , " Max said . " He paints now . Time flies fast in St. Cyprian 's Oratory . " " Where is the Oratory located these days ? " " Robin and I 've got a loft up the street . Had to clean up the place before we could move in . Pretty good light , but the stairs are narrow . It works all right , though . We break the panel up into blocks three by four and they can just get ' em down the stairs . . . . You know , Tom , it 's awfullyhandy having all these unemployables ' hanging around . Soon as we get a panel finished we put the word out and three or four of ' em come and whip her down the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? With your ' prentice painters and your patron  --  and even the poor , whom you seem to have always with you . "  | " It 's a fact , " Max said . " You know , these bums love lendinga hand . No good on the long haul but they like to do little jobs . Several men from the line have come in and asked if there was anything they could do . They 'll take even more interest in the chapel when that old wind blows up from the river . " " Are you going to have the chapel heated in the winter ? " " We hope to get hold of a furnace , somehow , " Max said cheerily , " but Rome was not built in a day . Neither was St. Eustace 's . . . . If you 'll come and stand over here I think you can get a pretty good light on the altarpiece . " He was moving over to stand beside one of the round concretepillars that supported the vault . Claiborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the halflighthe could make out the designs that filled the entire wall of the apse . Figures , apparently of men and women , the men distinguished from the women chiefly by the relativescantiness of the one garment that covered them , but all short and square-barreled , with the squareness of the bodies oddly echoed in a slight flatness of the heads , all moving from each end of a semicircle toward a small eminence which was crowned with a larger , squarer mass . The bull 's body , composed of metallic scales which overlapped each other and gleamed even in this dim light , rested on four stocky pillars . Its head was lowered , its jaws closed . The elongated apertures which perhaps represented its eyes seemed to brood over the four figures that confronted it . Something that was no doubt the plume of a helmet depended down St. Eustace 's back . The figure beside him , a woman 's , seemed to sway a little toward his . The movement was arrested by the determineduprightness of the small figure on her right , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . Claiborne slowly put his hand out and sketched in the air the movement of the four standing figures . " I do n't see how you ever brought that off , " he said . " Took doing , " Max said modestly , " but after all , I have n't hung around Hieronymus Bosch all these years for nothing . "  | " Well , I want to congratulate you . It 's the damnedest thing I 've seen in many a year . " " Ca n't have that kind of talk around here , " Max whispered , and pointed down the nave . Claiborne saw what he had not noticed before , a large black and white mass , with a smaller black and white mass beside it : the two nuns , prayingat the altar rail . Another , darker mass motionless beside one of the pillars midway down the nave , was probably somebody else praying . After all , that was what people came into churches for : to kneel at an altar and pray . An altar is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sacrifices are offered or incense burned in worship of a deity , ancestor , etc . ( I have what is known as a " photographic memory " and am , besides , possessed of a little learning . ) . . . Jacob was journeying from Beersheba to Haran when he came , about this time of day , " into a certain place . " And he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down to sleep and dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending upon it , which caused Jacob to wake , trembling , and saying : " Surely the Lord is in this place . . . . " " And sooner or later we 're going to have a parclose , " Max said . " There 's no reason in the world why we should n't . " " None that I can see , " Claiborne said . " And the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacro Speco , with the old shepherd , Montanus , walking on the cliffs above him . After all , the place where Eustace saw the stag must have been on that mountain that rises up opposite the Sacro Speco . . . . But we wo n't get to that for a while . . . . " " No . . . I mean yes , " Claiborne said . " Well , I 've got to get uptown . " " Do n't you want to wait and see Catherine ? " Max said . " There she is now . " The two nuns were still at the altar rail but the other dark mass was detaching itself from the pillar and moving **29;9484;TOOLONG mornings until time to go to the park , coming after the ball game , or staying all day when it rained , wanderingin because he knew nobody else , and because nobody else he knew would of stood him , settling down wherever we were , or following us around the house , never speaking much but only listening , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs one day and fell in love with her and wished to marry her , and I told him go ahead and marry her , anything to get him out of the house , but she would not . What did she want with $7,000 ? She must of paid half that much in taxes , for I know she paid her tax man $30o just to file , and him not nearly the expert Holly is . I seen her hold a $100 bill in her hand fishing in her purse for keys and throw it back in like any girl might throw a single back . After awhile you got used to him , and if he did n't show up you begun to worry and look at the clock , and then when you heard him on the steps you said , " Damn it all anyhow . Here he is again . " But once he stepped in the door you could not heave him out . He was so happy to see you , and he might of brung flowers or a slab of meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always something , never nothing , something for you and something for Katie that he took upstairs and handed to her between customers and kissed her on the cheek like she was i 6 and not yet been to her first dance . So we were never alone down there , for there was always Bruce , slouching , like in the barnyardsor in church , listening without listening , looking from me to her and back again like the world never seen 2 people so smart and so good . Any other man you would of said , " Take your eye off my wife like that , " but not Bruce.  |p51He  never left until we said , " Well , sack time , " and she popped open a button or zipped a zipper . He took off fast then , afraid he might see some part of Holly he believed he should not see . It even embarrassed him if she wore a low neckline , which she sometimes does , having a good neckline and wishing to show it off . Why not ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , there was nothing to say , and what we done we laid there and heard him paddering around in his room , or maybe heard him open his door very quiet and go on tip-toe down the stairs and out , and then a long time later back , though where he went I never knew and never asked . Sometimes he drove , but mostly he walked , and in the morning he was up before anybody , fresh , like he slept his full 8 . The last night he stood up until morning . He packed his suitcases and loaded them in my car , and his gear , and he drove his own car out back and parked it there , the one they give him when he signed and the one we drove down from Minnesota in , a 47 Moors with Cushion-Gear , probably the greatest flop in the history of the business . In his car he loaded his golf clubs and his remembrances from the war , his fishing poles and his guns . Then he burned some papers . We seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and raking the fire together to keep it burning , now and then reaching down and plucking a paper out and reading it , even while it burned in his hand , and then leaving it flutter down until all was burned . That is my best picture of him , standing there all black against the light of the fire and leaning on the rake , and Holly 's , too , and then we went to bed but could not sleep , and in the morning we shoved off for Aqua Clara.  |p52THE  TALK of the camp last spring was a kid name of Piney Woods , a wild and crazy catcher out of a place called Good Hope , Georgia , that the writers all called " Dutch 's good hope from Good Hope " until it become obviousthat he could not last . Back he went to QC in April , and we went into the year with the same 3 catchers we finished 54 with , Goose and Bruce and Jonah Brooks . Jonah come up from QC when Red split his finger in St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just fine , always singing . 13 runs behind and he will still be singing , calling " Wing her through , Author , wing her through , " and then after a good pitch singing , " Author wung her through , he wung her through , " except when now and then he thought the call was wrong , and then sung , " Oh-o-o-o Lord my big black ass , " his jaw always going and his mind always working , his eye everywhere , a natural catcher if ever I seen one , except he could not hit . For a time it looked like Piney Woods might be the answer . He can hit . But he is no natural . He is too wild and crazy . He drives in motorcycle races in the winter . Dutch was looking for a combination of a natural catcher like Jonah and a hitter like Piney , and still is . I guess there is only one Red Traphagen in a lifetime.  |p53The  first few days me and Lucky Judkins sat in the stands watching the drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were holding out for . I do n't know why you lie about money . I guess you figure people figure you are lying , so you might as well . One morning Ugly Jones dumb up from the field and said , " Author , leave me give you one piece of advice . Do not hang in the park because your eye gleams and your hand itches . You are becoming anxious to play ball , and this will cost you money , " which was true . I mean it was true I was becominggleamy , I guess . Ugly is a wise old hand , veteran of many a holdout , and I went back to the house , and we swum and laid on the beach and played badminton and waited for the telephone to ring , and every time it rung I said , " This is Old Man Moors meeting my price , " but it never was , and to myself I thought , " This is Bruce . The attack come . " But it was never Bruce neither . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Jaros wishing to play Tegwar . The boys phoned a lot , or dropped by , and I kept in touch . My weight kept going up something awful . The real bomb-burst was Lucky getting swapped to Cincinnati for F. D. R. Caselli , a right-hand pitcher and a good boy , a cousin by marriage of Gussie Petronio , the Mammoth catcher before Red , leaving me the last and only holdout . I might of went out of my mind a little if there been any left-hand pitching in camp , but there was none , go boys that threw with their left hand maybe , but none that threw very hard or very smart , and I sat tight . The boys were all with me , down to the last penny . It all dragged on so long I said to Holly , " Am I a baseballplayer or only a man living on the beach at Aquap54Clara ? " and she said , " What difference ? " Everything you said to her any more she said , " What difference ? " meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . I never seen her so still before . She is usually always running around doing 77 things at once , hanging with the wives , reading books , studying taxes , cleaning the house , gassing on the phone , but now she done nothing only laid on the beach and looked at the waves . Now and then she took a dip and flipped over and left the waves wash her in , and then she laid on the sand again and browned up , and nights she got all dressed for Bruce . He come down every night after work . You could see him from far off , walking along and looking at the waves and whistling " Come Josephine In My Flying Machine , " which the boys all sung in honor of Piney and his stupid motorcycle . Piney himself sung it every time you asked him , closing his eyes , not laughing , thinking you loved hearing it for the singing , when the reason you loved it was he took it so serious , singingCome Josephine in my flying machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself like a bird on the beam , In the air she goes , there she goes . Up , up , a little bit higher , Oh my , the moon is on fire . Come Josephine in my flying machine , Going up , goodby , all on , goodby . He always dragged a stick in the sand behind him . He parked it by the door and come in and ate , salads for me mostly , and lean meat and no bread and butter and this disgusting skim milk , my weight at 209 by now and climb/ing a mile a minute , and when we was done we sat out back , out of the ocean breeze , until along about 10 he went around the house for his stick , and I drove him back to the Silver Palms . In the hotel we shoved his bed around near the phone , and I wrote my number on a piece of paper and tacked it on the wall , and he said , " I hope if it happens it will not happen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might or might not probably never happen . I have no faith in those cockeyed doctors up there . But if it happens do not stop and check the time , just call me , " and he said he would . I begun selling policies to kill the time . I drove down to St. Pete every couple days , and Tampa and Clearwater , and over to Lakeland once , never pushing , only chatting with the various boys and leaving it sell itself , which it does once you put the idea in their mind . All spring they see too many old-time ballplayers floating from camp to camp and putting the touch on old friends , maybe giving a pointer to a kid and then saying , " By the way , could you advance me 5 until the first of the month ? " which kids often do , probably writing home , " Oh boy , I just had the privilege of loaning 5 to So-and-so , " until after they loaned out enough 5 's it did not seem so much like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he was traded . Lucky was the second person I ever sold an annuity to , and he said , " Well , Author , one day we will all be done working . We will just fish and look in the box once a month for the checks , me and you and Bruce and all the rest , " and I almost told him , for it was getting hard to carry it around . But I smothered it back . Once you told somebody everybody would know , and once Dutch knew itp56would of been " Goodby , Bruce . " " It is hard picturing you in a Cincinnati suit , " I said . In the lobby of The Floridian I got to gassing with Brick Brickell , the managerof Cincinnati . " You are holding out serious , " he said . " For what ? " " $27,500 , " I said . " You will never get it , " he said . Then he looked around to see if anybody was listening . " We would pay it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Try me , " he said . " Hold out long enough and we will buy you , and I give you my verbal word we will pay you 25,000 at the least . I been trying to buy you already . " " What are they asking ? " I said . " A quarter of a million dollars and players , " he said . " What will they take ? " I said. 150,000 and players , " he said . " What will you give ? " said I. " Now , Author , " he said , " I can not reveal a thing of that sort . The trouble is that they want Sam Mott . Dutch is worried about his catching . " " Does he not worry about his left-hand pitching ? " I said . " Brooklyn will sell him Scudder , " he said , " but only if you are gone , not wishing to cut their own throat . " I drove F. D. R. Caselli back with me , jabbering all the way , him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept making up these little conversations where Old Man Moors called me on the phone , pleading with me , " Come on and sign . I will meet your price , " until I was just about ready to call him myself . But then again I told myself , " No ! Do not sell yourself short ! " F. D. R. had blisters on his hands ,  |p57and  he kept asking me what was good for them , and I told him something or other . I forget what . All spring the wives kept pumping Holly full of miserablestories about babies born with this or that missing , and mothers suffering , which if she ever believed any of it she would of went wild . But she never believes what people say , and all that happened I kept getting as fat as a pig until what we done we bought a badminton set and played badminton all day , deductible , for my weight is a matter of business . By the middle of March I was probably the world 's champion heavyweight left-hand badminton player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the club said it was definitely closing a deal with Cleveland for Rob McKenna , saying this on a Friday night for the Saturday paper and leaving no chance for anybody to deny it on Sunday , for they have no Sunday paper in Aqua Clara , and putting all the writers a little bit on the spot since they hated calling Cleveland all the way out in Arizona to check on the truth of what they already probably knew was the bunk . This scared me , though , and I went to the phone , and the instant I touched it it rung , and a voice said , " Do not touch that phone ! " It was Ugly Jones . " Author , " he said , " you are doing fine . " " I am fatter than a pig , " I said . " Good , " he said . " That is the way to convince them , for it worries them more than it worries you . It might not even be a bad idea to show yourself around . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we done we went out the park the following Wednesday and sat in the stands behind first . There wasp58about 6 left-handers warming , a few wearing QC suits that been up the spring before , the rest wearing Mammoth shirts , one kid wearing my number , 44 , kids , all kids , and all full of hope . Old Man Moors and Patricia and some automobile peopleup from Miami strolled in and sat down , Bradley Lord joining them soon after . Patricia said " Hello " and asked Holly how she was . Her and Holly gassed awhile , and then she went back . Old Man Moors glanced up my way , pretendinghe was looking over the paint job on the park , and I called for peanuts , which fat you up about a pound for a dime , and I begun munching away . The first left-hander set George and Perry down 1-2 , and the peanuts went dry in my mouth a little . Pasquale then took 2 strikes and belted one out amongst the palms , and I give a little look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when Sid hit one that fell not 4 feet from where Pasquale 's went , back-to-back homers from the power factory , always a nice sight , and Canada shot a single into left , and Piney one into right . Dutch shouted , " I seen enough of that one , " waving the lefthanderout of there and bringing on a new one , a tall , thin kid with a dizzy habit of wearing his glove with 3 fingers out . He walked Vincent and Ugly and hit Herb Macy on the butt until when he finally found the plate George blasted one back at him that bounced off his knee and blooped out over second base , and the poor kid was lugged off on a stretcher . Another one went out the same way the same day . Once Dutch looked up at me , and I waved . He did not wave back . He takes it as a personal insult . Behind your back he tells you , " Sure , sock it to them for every nickelp59you are worth , " but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was a holdout more than once in his playing days , and anyhow he was quite busy waving one left-hander out and a new one in , about 5 of them before a kid come on in the sixth and struck Sid and Canada out . The Moorses begun shaking their head " Yes " between themself , Bradley Lord shaking his , too , as soon as he seen it was safe , The World 's Only Living Human Spineless Skunk . This newest kid was rather fast , but no curve whatsoever , and I said to Holly , " The boys see that he has no curve by now , " which they did all right . Piney and Vincent singled . Ugly stepped in , looking up my way and giving me a kind of a wink and taking a couple and then lacing a drive down the line in right that the whole park busted out laughing over because it slammed up against the fence and stuck there , this old rat-trap fence made of boards , the drive getting jammed in between 2 boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But it was in tight , and Ugly trotted around the bases laughing , and even Dutch was laughing , and by then the Moorses and the people from Miami were laughing , and Bradley Lord , too , seeing all the rest , and about one minute later Lindon bounced one off the same fence that knocked the first ball through , and Mr. Left-Hander Number 6 went off to the shower . You really had to laugh . I mean , when a ball slams up against a fence your eye is back out on the field , looking for the rebounce , and then when it do n't you think the whole world has went flooey or something , like when you drop a shoe you hear it clunk , and if no clunk comes you quick dial the madhouse . Every so often I begun to laugh , and Holly , too , and Old Man Moors turned around and give me a look , and me and Holly got up aboutp60then and yawned and stretched and bought a couple more peanuts and went home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rung , and I sat beside it and left it ring 12 or 13 times until I picked it up and said in my most boring voice , " Fishing pier . Hookworms for sale , " only it was n't Old Man Moors a-tall but Joe Jaros , and he said , " Author , how about a hand of Tegwar or 2 ? " I already turned him down a number of times , not wishing to hang in the hotel and look anxious , but I was in the mood now , and I said , " We will be right down . " " Who do you mean by " we " ? " he said , and I said I meant me and Bruce . " Me and Bruce been playing quite a bit all winter , " I said . " He is pretty good by now , " though this was not true , for he was not . " I will stay here , " said Bruce , and that settled it , at least for now , and he stood with Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby , a table for 3 , one chair for me and one for him and one empty and waiting for the slaughter . He had a pocket full of change and little bills . Next to the empty chair he stood a lamp all lit and bright , and at the empty place a clean and shining ash tray . The empty chair stood just a little sideways so a cluck could slide in easy . He shuffled , shuffling over and over again but never dealing , just waiting for the cluck to wander in sight . Joe knew . He can spot one a block away , or walk through a dining car and spot one , or pick one out in a crowd . He been at it 3o years , and I said , " Joe , when my wife goes home Bruce must play with us . " " Sure , " he said , not thinking , but then it hit home , and he said , " Now , Author , Bruce is not the type . He is toop61damn dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not last the year . " " You must promise me , " I said , and he promised , for right about then he seen his party and would of promised you could hang him in the morning . He got all excited . " That looks like it , " he said , and we begun to deal , and in through the lobby come a big chap wearing sun glasses , though he was indoors , and though it was night , his arms all red the way a fellow gets when he never sees the sun except a couple weeks on vacation , a big button in his coat in the shape of a fish saying FEARED IN THE DEEP that the local people hand out by the bushel to every cluck that do n't actually faint dead away at the sight of the ocean . He bought a magazine and sat down in an easy chair and begun to read , soon wondering why he could not see , and then shoving his glasses up on his head , every so often peekingat us over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and furious now , really working , too , because I will swear if you concentrate hard enough you can bring the cluck up out of his chair and over , which we soon done , for he closed his magazine and worked up his energy and hauled himself up , his sun glasses falling back down over his eyes . Over he come , sticking his magazine in his coat and leaning his hands down on the back of the empty chair and finally saying , " Would you mind if I watch ? " We never spoke nor looked up . We played Casino , your 8 takes a 5 and a 3 , your io takes a 6 and a 4 , like that , pictures taking pictures , and when the hand was done Joe flipped his wrist around and said , " A quarter of 8 . " No , " said Mr. Feared In The Deep , " I said would you mind if I watch . "  | " Oh , " said Joe , " I thought you asked me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only dealing again , straight Casino again except with a little switch here and there , maybe a 7 taking in a 5 and a 9 , or a deuce an ace and a 3 , Casino , only doubled , so there was still some sort of a system to it , though not too much system to the cash sliding back and forth , the cluck watching and studying , taking off his glasses and twirling them , 2 or 3 times starting to say something but then not saying it , only saying once , " It looks like Casino , " neither me nor Joe answering him nor even hearing him for all he knew until after the hand I said , " Did you speak ? " " I only said it looks like Casino , " he said . " Casino ? " said Joe . " Like the card game called Casino , " said Feared In The Deep . " You mean the game they play in boarding schools for girls ? " said Joe . " I did not know it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally played Casino myself from time to time . " " We only play men 's games , " said Joe . We dealed again . " Would you mind if I sat down ? " said the cluck . Nobody said " No , " and he sat , and he slapped his pants where his money was and looked at his watch and sort of inched his chair around until he was finally forward over the table , his eye going from my hand to Joe 's , the game becoming a little more complicated now , Joe calling once , " Goddam it , fence-board ! " and slapping down his hand and showing how he fence-boarded , me laughing and gathering in the money , Joe saying , " I never fence-boarded before since one time against Babe Ruth in St. Pete , " the clink really quite confused about now and ready to go back and look at his magazine.  |p63Right  about then I was paged , and Joe went red . " Hang around , " he said . " Never mind it . Hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " So you are Henry Wiggen , " said the cluck . " I seen you was left-handed but did not know who . It is quite an honor . " " I must go , Joe , " I said . " Damn it , Author . Stick around . " He was boiling inside , for Tegwar is serious business to him , the great laugh of his life . He will laugh for days after a good night of Tegwar . He will tell you Tegwar stories going back 30 years , of clucks on trains and clucks in hotels , and of great Tegwarpartners he had , ballplayers now long since faded from the scene , remembering clubs not half so much by what they done but how they rode with the gag , how they gathered , like the boys even at that moment were gathering for a glimpse of the big fish on the line . It is the gathering of the boys that Joe loves , for without the watching of the crowd the laugh would be hollow . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page come by , saying , " Mr. Wiggen , Mr. Wiggen , " and Joe said , " Scram ! " and the page scrammed . But it was no good , and the boys knew it and Joe knew it and I knew it . It takes time . The cluck has got to lay his money on the table and leave it there awhile . He has got to think about it . It has got to be the cluck 's own choice every minute of the way , and he has got to hang himself himself , not be hung by others . It must never be hurried . Yet with the page calling we could not play it slow , though we tried . Then soon the boys all stepped aside , and Dutch come through and said , " I been trying for days to get some sleep and finally was just drifting off when I am told you arep64playing cards and too busy to talk contract . Do not push things too far , Author . " " It was my fault , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Dutch seen the cluck there and felt sorry for Joe , or as sorry as he can ever feel , and he said so . " What good is being sorry ? " said Joe , and he slammed down the cards , and he swore , and Mr. Feared In The Deep begun backwateringas fast as he could , hearing both laughing and swearing but not understanding a word , and I went on up to the Moorses sweet , feeling sorry for Joe and yet also laughing . Nobody else was laughing but me when I got there . I said , " Leave us not waste time talking contract unless you are willing to talk contract . I was taught in school where slavery went out when Lincoln was shot . " " I know , " said Old Man Moors , " for you wrote it across the top of your contract . " " Not across my contract , " I said . " Maybe across the contract of a turnstile turner . " " Author , " said Patricia , " leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , and I said so , and she thanked me . Her nose was quite sunburned . " You are lookingover your weight , " she said . " It will no doubt take you many weeks to get in shape . " " He looks io pounds over his weight at least , " ' said Bradley Lord . " Mr. Bradley Lord , " said I , whipping out my loose cash . " I have $200 here which says I am no more than 2 and % pounds over my weight if you would care to go and fetch the bathroom scale . " " What do you consider your absolute minimum figure ? " said Mr. Moors.  | " 19,000 , " I said . " In that case , " said he , " we can simply never do business , and I suppose I must be put to the trouble of scouringup another left-hand pitcher . " " That should not be hard , " said I , " for I seen several promising boys out there this afternoon . Any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else . " " They are top-flight boys , " said Mr. Moors . " Dutch thinks extremely high of at least 3 of them . I will tell you what I will do , Wiggen . I will jack up my absolute maximumfigure to 13,500 and not a penny more , and if you have a good year we will make it back to you in 56 . " " And when I have a good year in 56 you will make it back to me in 57 , " I said , " and I will go on being paid for the year before . This shorts me out of a year in the long run . " " We heard this one before , " said Bradley Lord . " Every time Bradley Lord opens his mouth I am raising my absolute minimum figure , " I said . " Bradley , " said Patricia , " go get some drinks . " " You feel very confident about this year , " said Mr. Moors , " and I will tell you what I will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down figures . " For the loth victory you win this year I will pay you a bonus of 2,500 , and for every game over 20 I will pay you 2,000 more , and then to show you where my heart is I will jack up my absolute maximum figure to 14,000 . " " We are coming closer together , " said Patricia . " I believe we are just about there , " said Old Man Moors . Bradley come back with 3 cokes , giving one to Old ManMoors and one to Patricia and keeping one for himself . " As a starter , " said I , " I like the look of the arrangement . But instead of 20 victories you must write in 15 , "  | " If I write in 15 I must lower the amount , " he said . " You are so damn-fire sure you are going to have such a top-flight year I would think you would jump at the arrangement . " " I am sure about the year I am going to have , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing money left and right and Holly pregnant and the high cost of Coca-cola . I am tired living like a sharecropper . " " Bradley , " said Patricia , " go get Author a coke . " Old Man Moors was sketching out the new bonus arrangementon the back of my contract , but he looked up now . " How much do you still owe the goddam Government ? " he said. " $421.89 , " I said . He wrote this down on a separate sheet . " I will throw this in , " he said , " plus pay you a bonus of $1,500 for the 15th victory you win this year , and 1,000 for every victoryover 15 . You are better off than you were under the first arrangement . " " Not if I win 25 games , " I said . " If you win 25 games I will round out Bonus Plan Number 2 to equal Number One , " said he . " But you know you are not libel to win 25 games . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you win 25 games I will be so goddam pleased I will pay you a flat 5,000 bonus if I do not drop dead from surprise . " " I won 26 in 52 , " said I. " Yes , " said he , " but never come near it since . " He mentionedmy Won-and-Lost for 53 and 54 , which everybody knows , so no need to repeat . Bradley Lord come back with my coke , and Old Man Moors shoved him the separate sheet , saying , " Make out a check in this amount and sendp67it to the United States Bureau of Internal Revenue in the name of Wiggen . Very well , Henry , your base pay will be 14,000 plus Bonus Plan Number 2 . I think that is fair . I know that you are going to have a grand year , " and he reached out his hand . He was calling me " Henry " now , all smiles , which he had a right to be , I guess , for I believe he was ready to go much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push him , for the main job was yet ahead , and I did not take his hand , saying , " Sir , there is oneclause yet to go in my contract . " " Shoot , " said he . " There must be a clause , " said I , " saying that me andBruce Pearson will stay with the club together , or else go together . Whatever happens to one must happen to theother , traded or sold or whatever . We must be tied in a package on any deal under the sun . " " No deals are on the fire , " said he . " I never heard of such a thing , " said Bradley Lord . Patricia was powdering her nose out of a little compact . She snapped the lid shut , and it was the only sound , and she said , " It is not a matter of whether anybody ever heard of such a thing before or not , and it is not a matter whether any deals are on the fire or not . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first reason being that Dutch would never hear of it , and all the rest of the reasons second . " " Boys and girls , " said Old Man Moors , " leave us be calm . Wiggen , I will give you my verbal word instead of writing it in . " " It must be wrote in , " said I. " Bradley , " said Patricia , " call Dutch . " " He is asleep , " said Bradley.  | " He been trying for days to get some sleep , " said I. " Call him , " she said . Bradley called him , and it rung a long time , and when you heard his voice you could hear it all over the room , like he was there , and Bradley held the phone away from his ear , and then he said , " Mr. Moors wishes to see you , " and after awhile he come down in his slippers and robe , pajama pants but no top . " I been trying for days to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go get me a coke . " " Tell him your clause , " said Patricia . He looked at me with his eyes shut . " So it is you with a special clause , Author ? I will bet it is a dilly . " His voice was low and full of sleep , and he kept scrounging in his eyes with his hands , trying to wake up . " Bradley , run get me a wet rag , " he said . He took a swig of his coke . " Sterling must be shot for hay fever with a special shot . Vincent Carucci must have contact lenses . Gonzalez must have a buddy along to speak Spanish with , and Goldman must go home on Passover . What do you wish , Author , the Chinese New Year off or Dick Tracy 's birthday ? " " I wish a clause , " said I , " tying me in a package with Pearson . " " Does he owe you money ? " said Old Man Moors . Bradley brung him the rag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus , Bradley , you ai n't got much strength in your hand , " he said . " How do you mean tied in a pack-age ? " " If he is sold I must be sold , " I said . " Or if he is traded I must be traded the same place . Wherever he goes I must go " His face was covered with the rag , and when he took it away the color was gone , drained away down in his chest.  |p69I  will swear the hair of his chest was red , and then slowly it drained back up again , and he said , " This is telling me who I must keep and who not , which nobody ever told me before , Author , and nobody will ever tell me again as long as I am upright . If it is money talk money , and good luck . Talking money is one thing . But talking business is another , and I will as soon trade the whole club for a tin of beans as leave anybody tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am sorry to hear it , " said I , " because without that clause there will be no contract . " " Then there will be no contract , " said Dutch , " and I must suffer along the best I can . " " Several of those left-handers looked good to me , " said Old Man Moors . " Good for what ? " said Dutch . " Will you go sell insurance ? " said Bradley Lord . " You do not know a soul on earth to sell insurance to outside of ballplayers . Will you sell insurance to other insurance agents ? Where will you run up against people with money with the language you speak ? I never seen you wear a necktie . " " Shut up , " said Dutch . " I am ignoring him , " said I. " I am only laying it out straight , all my cards up . I do not wish to sell insurance . Insurance is for later . I rather play baseball than anything else . I do it best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like the boys . I like the hours and the money . I like the fame and the glory . I like to think of 50,000 people getting up in the morning and squashing themself to death in the subwayto come and see me play ball . " " That is how I feel , " said Dutch.  | " I am dead serious , " said I. " What is up between you 2 ? A roomie is a roomie , Author , not a Siamese twin brother fastened at the hip . I do not understand this a-tall , and I will investigate it . I will run it down to the end of the earth . Are you a couple fairies , Author ? That can not be . It been a long time since I run across fairies in baseball , not since Will Miller and another lad that I forget his name , a shortstop , that for Christ sake when they split they went and found another friend . This is all too much for me . " " You will understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No telling , " I said . " Maybe soon , maybe not for 15 years . " " I am 62 , " said Dutch . " I will certainly be hanging by my thumb until I hear . Christ Almighty , I seen you on days when you hated Pearson , when you ate him out as bad as I myself ever ate him out . I seen you about to kill him for his stupidity . I seen you once get up from the table and walk away . " " Because he laughed without knowing why , " I said . " Such a thing can be not only hate but also love , " said Patricia . " It is not love , " said I. " I do not mean fairy love , " she said . " He laughs because he wishes to be one of the boys-all the time , " said Dutch . " Must this clause go on forever ? " He closed his eyes again , not sleeping but thinking . " I have 4 catchers , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another that can not hit and another that is wild and crazy and another that is just plum dumb . " He opened his eyes and begun checking them off on his fingers . " I would givep71both my eyes for Sam Mott of Cincinnati , but they want Author , and I can not give Author , or if I give you I must have Scudder off Brooklyn which the son of a bitches will not give me except for all my right-hand power . I could spare my right-hand power if I could swing a deal with Pittsburgh , but Pittsburgh wants Author and I have already give you to Cincinnati on paper for Sam Mott . So I must play my old catcher on days when he feels young , and my catcher that can not hit on days the power is on , and my wild and crazy catcher on days he ever comes to his senses , which so far he has give me no sign of really having any . I will ship him back to QC and see if Mike can talk him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . I been trying for days to get some sleep . When you really stop and think about it I am libel to wind up using my catcher that is just plum dumb more and more . " He finished off his coke and belched a loud belch and scratched the hair on his chest . " Some day you will understand , " I said . " No , " said he . " That is too much to ask . Forget it . I will agree to this clause . I never done such a thing before and would not do it now except there is a look in your eye that tells me that I must . " He looked in my eye a long time . " Yes , " he said , " there is a look which tells me that I must , " and that was all he said but went back out and up to bed , and Bradley Lord drew up the contract and we all signed.  |p72WE  PLAYED 6 exhibitions down around St. Pete , but I did not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Pete on the back of the papers the doctors give me in Minnesota , and we checked with Bruce morning and night . We talked very careful because the operators listen in , saying only " How are you ? " and he was fine . In the hotel in New York there 's an operator name of Tootsie that knows everything you know before you know it yourself half the time . Days I worked out with the QC Cowboys . I was supposedto run it off , but what could be more of a bore than only running , and what I mostly done I stood around sweating in a rubber shirt . I sweated myself down to 205 and felt good and started throwing a little , though as soon as I started throwing I started eating again and ate myself back up to 208 , which would of scared me silly except I noticed 2 things . I noticed that I was throwing quicker , getting more speed out of less motion . Also I felt tip-top , and it begun to seem to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my weight . Holly said the same . " It is not half so much where your weight is but what your mind thinks about it , " she said . You could feel 600 Dollarsp73give a little kick every so often , and when he done so she said , " Patience , boy , you will soon enough be out and see it all . " The club got back on Tuesday night . Usually we always broke camp that night , but things been changed since I become Player Representative , and we do not leave until Wednesday any more . The boys get their full night sleep this way , and the day 's gate we lose in Jacksonville is out of nobody 's pocket but Old Man Moors . Wednesday morning Bruce come down and helped us close the house , and we took the key to Tom Tootle , a hobbly old fellow , a great ballplayer with the Mammoths back around 1904-10 . For $25.10 a year he watches your house for you and sends you a postcard every 2 months , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your house is in good shape " and signing it with a little drawing of a steam engine , and out of the engine a little puff of smoke saying " Toot Toot , " which is what everybody calls him , Toot Toot Tootle . You can take him off your tax . You can also take extra depreciation off your house down there on account of the salt air , which hardly anybody knows , though by now I told everybody along the beach . We also take extradepreciation off the car since it is parked 162/3% of the year in salt air . We picked up Coker and Darlene Roguski in front of the Silver Palms and headed north for Jacksonville . While loading Darlene 's gear in front of the Silver Palms up walks Piney Woods . He was wearing these parachute shoes and airplane pants and a scarlet shirt and helmet and goggles , and he took a big watch out of his pocket and said to me , " It is 13 o'clock . I will give you a handicap of 45 minutes and beat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashion 12 is not good enough for Piney . " So get going , " he said , and he went back to his motorcycle piled high with gear , a catcher 's mitt sitting on top . He pulled his goggles down and sat on his machine with his arms folded . I never give him another thought but got in and took off . We sung , me and Holly and Coker and Darlene . Me and Coker sing in The Mammoth Quartet and pick up a little change now and then on the TV , and after we sung awhile Bruce begun , though I hardly ever heard him sing before except one thing and nothing more . Sometimes he singsYes , we have no bananas , We have no bananas today . That is all he sings , never more . But now he sungAll that year the sun did shineExcept it rained ' bout half the time . The well went dry , and so am I-I-I-I-I So pass the jug around . He sung many songs , singing low and soft but also merry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , and they all took place in the dark , but with a moon , the kind of songs you pick up late at night on the road , especially down in the south , corn that you would switch to another station if there was another station on . But hearing somebody sing them they were n't so corn at that . There was one about a farmer boy in love with the girl down the road , but her old man said " Nix ! " and built a fence between their house , and the boy dumb the fence , and every time he dumb it the farmer built it higher , and every time he built it higher Bruce sung higher , singing ofp75the boy climbing over until he sung so high he could go no higher and said , " Holly , you take it from there , " and she went up and up with the fence until she could go no higher and said , " Bruce , I am as high as I can go , " and Bruce sung very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl digging under from the other side until they met in the middle , and the girl 's father come along and seen them and shot them and shoveled them over , and out of their heart grew these weeds , up through the ground and windingand winding around the fence forever , which I know sounds corny when you write it . Soon Piney Woods come up behind us , probably going 75 or 8o and passing us , not looking at us but only sticking his arm out sideways at us and cutting in front with not more than a foot to spare so if I did n't come off the gas we would of clipped him , and Coker said , " You would think a young fellow like Piney would wish to live the summer through and see who wins the flag , " and I cut him short , saying , " You been hitting good all spring , Coker , have you not ? " but he kept right on , saying , " With all the ways of dying you would think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My , Darlene , " said Holly . " Is that a new dress ? It must of set your husband back a pretty penny . " " What in the hell is the sense of dying young ? " said Coker . " Why not live and see how life treats you ? " " Coker , " said I , " I hear you are being sold . " That stopped him , plus we come around a bend and seen Piney Woods by the side of the road whipping off his goggles and unstrapping his tools , and we pulled in , and we said , " What is the matter ? " He never looked up . " Nothing , " he said , " I simplyp76busted my master distributor . Do you have any spare parts ? " " Motorcyle parts ? " I said . Coker called back to the car . " Darlene , did we bring along our spare motorcycle parts this trip ? " " Tie her on the back , " said I. " It is not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would I do in Gainesville ? " he said . " Get a new part , " said I , " or else you are libel to be out here in the middle of nowheres until 67 o'clock or halfpast41 . " " I will beat you to Jacksonville , " he said . " OK , " we said , and off we went , singing another 3o miles until up alongside comes Piney again , a little stream of brown and blue smoke trailing out behind , and past he went , sticking out his arm again , and we followed his trail for miles and miles , the smoke becoming more brown , and then pure blue , and then black , until soon we seen him at the side of the road again , wrapped in black smoke , all black himself now , sitting on the shoulder with his legs straight out , the parts of his machine all spread out in a circle around him , and we stopped again , and Bruce said , " You been smoking all the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are libel to need a bath one of these days , " said Coker . " Get going , " he said . " I will beat you to Jacksonville . " " He is going to carry her in on his back , " said Coker , " juggling the parts in his other hand . Tell me , Piney , are you planning to go all the way back to QC on this motor-cycle ? "  | " I am not going back to QC , " he said . " I will bet you $10 , " said Coker , " that you get shipped back to QC , and another io that you do not beat us to Jacksonville . " He finally looked up now . " It is a bet , " he said , and up he got and counted out his money and give it to me to hold , never smiling , only spraddling down again and slamminghis parts back in . " You better get going , " he said . He passed us about 5 miles out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hanky tied around his mouth and tucked up under his goggles . He was waiting in front of the hotel when we got there . I give him back his 20 . We said " Goodby " to the girls . " Good luck , boys , " said Holly . " I believe this is your year again , " and she went around the car to the driver side . " Take care of 600 Dollars , " I said . " He is always right here where I can keep a track of him , " she said , and she kissed me and kissed Bruce , standing on her toes and kissing him solid on the mouth and then climbing back in under the wheel and taking off . She stood with Darlene 2 days in West Virginia , and then she went on home . I did not see her again until she come down for the doubleheader Memorial Day . In the hotel in Jacksonville , and then again in all the hotels all summer , the first thing I done was flip open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 6 doctors or so on the back of the pages the doctors give me in Rochester , Minnesota . He always seen me doing it , but he never said a word , only pulled a chair up to the window and kicked off his shoes and spit down once or twice , sortp78of trying it out , and then he sat back and stuck his feet on the ledge . He liked to watch people in windows across the way , and he liked to watch the signs flash off and on . He liked to watch the sun go down and up . He begun thinking about baseball a lot , which he never done before , always treating it before like it was football or golf , not a thing to think about but only play . He said to me , " Arthur , tell me , if you was on one club and me on another what kind of a book would you keep on me ? " " If I was to keep a book on you , " said I , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book on Pearson , for Pearsonkeeps no book on me . " Because if I was to strike you out on fast balls letter high you would not go back to the bench thinking , " That son of a bitch Wiggen struck me out on fast balls letter high , so I will be on the lookout for the same thing next time . " No , you go back to the bench thinking , " I would like a frank , " or " I see pretty legs in the stands , " and by the time you face me again you have forgot all about the time before . You must remember . Or if you can not remember you must write it down . The man you are facing is not a golf ball sitting there waiting for you to bash him . He is a human being , and he is thinking , trying to see through your system and trying to hide his own . This is not golf , goddam it , nor football , but human being against human being , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got the advantage over the other . " " I will keep a book , " he said . " Either in your head , " I said , " or better still on paper for awhile . You already have terrific power . But power plus brains is the difference between nobody and somebody . " " I must develop brains , " he said.  | " Plus confidence , " said I. " Brains and power are nothing without confidence . " " I never had it much , " he said . " You always had it , Arthur . " " No sir , " said I , " but I always looked like I had it and sounded like I had it . Days when I am tired and days when my curve is not breaking it is confidence keeps me going . I hitch up my britches and spit . Crowd in and look fierce , and you will find it works wonders . Watch any of the boys when they hit . Watch Pasquale or Canada . They crowd in like they simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it is not their day . Half the pitchers you face are only country boys like yourself , and the other half are only country boys from the city . They are no smarter than you . " " I never been smart , Arthur . " " You been dumb on one count only . You left somebody tell you you were dumb . But you are not . You know which way the rivers run , which I myself do not know . Even Holly does not know , and I doubt that Red Traphagen himself can look at a river and tell you which way it runs without throwing a stick in it . All the way down from MinnesotaI never knew . " " I thought you knew , " he said . " Because I bullshit you , " I said . " You know what is planted in the fields and you know the make of cows . Who in hell on this whole club knows one cow from the other ? I could be stranded in the desert with 412 cows and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow . Did Hut Sut Sutter know a cow or a river when he seen one ? No , I guess not . And where did he wind up anyhow , this great brain you admire ? A goddam professional football player !  |p80Would  you like to be a football player in snow and ice up there in Wisconsin , up and down on the frozen ground ? You have already proved yourself smarter than Sutter and smarter than 90,000 kids from coast to coast , every one of them dying to be in your shoes , a New York Mammoth riding the best trains and the best hotels . Why has not Dutch cut you loose if you are so dumb ? " " I do not know , " he said . " Simply because you are not , " said I. " Dutch will be keeping you and shipping Piney Woods back to Mike . Is Dutch smart ? " " He certainly is , " he said . " Do you think he would stand for a dumb ballplayer ? " " No . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? " " No , " he said , " I guess not , Arthur , now that you mentionit . " " Did you not buy an Arcturus policy ? Did it not prove a smart move ? " " I guess so , " he said . " Can a dumb person do a smart thing ? " " No sir , Arthur , I guess not . " " Then wise up , " I said . " I will keep a book , " he said . " I will have more confidenceand brains . You are giving me the old confidence already . You are a smart fellow , Arthur . " " And tell me one more thing , " I said . " Would a smart fellow like me room with a dumb one ? 2 by 2 like Jonah in the ark . Take Jonah . Who does he room with ? He rooms withp81Perry , color with color , and Washburn rooms with Crane , color with color again , and George with this Spanish boy because language with language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches with coaches , like with like . Goose Williams and Horse Byrd together , stinker with stinker . There is always a reason why 2 fellows are roomies . I never seen it fail yet . So I would not be libel to room with you if you were dumb because you yourself just said how smart I was . Did you not ? " " Yes I did , " he said . " And I meant it , " which he did , for he always thought high of me , thought I was just about the smartest individual going . He always asks me i , 000,000 things like who in hell is some cluck in the newsreel or why in hell did they ever take the 2-deckers off 5th Avenue or what kind of a salary does the President make , and I always told him , whether I knew or not , and he always believedme , dumb as he was . He caught in about 8 games on the way north with Philly . It was cold . Also the railroad was out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and twice we took planes . It was all a mess . Standing around in the airportone day Bob Dietz of Philadelphia said to me , " Author , what in the hell was the name of your catcher last night ? How come Dutch is using him all of a sudden ? He is not a bad ballplayer , only hits too much in the same place all the time , " which meant to me that they were keeping a book on him , which they never done before . " I do not know , " I said . I did not . I mean , I did not know why Dutch begun using him . I only know that by the time we hit home he went back to using only Jonah , deciding he had all the power he needed . We really hadp82power all spring , Pasquale and Sid and Canada the big guns , especially against right-hand pitching . They hit 3 home runs in a row one night in Savannah , the kind of a thing that makes a pitcher lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I myself done anyhow all spring no matter what , for I was hot , 9 pounds over my weight but faster than ever . The boys on Philly all said the same , saying , " Author , I never seen you so fast . I guess holding out agrees with you . " I felt good in mind and body and said to hell with my weight and never stepped on a scale all spring . The Quartet sung in the shower , and we sung one TV date in Atlanta and picked up a little change . I remember we sung " Come Josephine In My Flying Machine " quite a bit . I suppose he might of used him more if he was n't such a bother , even with the power on , for Dutch can always use more power no matter how much he already got . But Bruce in the lineup was always a bother to Dutch . Dutch sits and shakes and says , " I wonder did the sign get through to Pearson , " and everybody says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it did n't . The sign goes from the dugout to Perry or Coker and they then flash it home , but Bruce is not always sure where they are coming from , or when , and he often crouched there looking at Coker for his sign when it was coming from Perry , or the other way around , now one and then the other , or Perry might flash a phony sign , or Coker the same , to keep the opposition from swiping it , though what it sometimes amounts to is Bruce himself is the only person fooled . He is too ashamed to call time or come out for a conference , and he sometimesflashes the first sign he sees , and there is hell to payp83afterwards , Dutch saying , " How come a curve ball to Williger ? He eats curves . " " Pearson signed for a curve , " says the pitcher . " You signed for a curve ? " says Dutch . " Yes sir , " says Bruce . " I must of missed my sign . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nose on your face , " says Dutch . " I was looking at Simpson . " " Why ? " says Dutch . " Is he more beautiful to look at ? Was it not an odd-number inning ? " " Yes sir , " says Bruce , " but I thought it was an evennumberinning . " " What in hell do you think they build scoreboards for ? " says Dutch . " Count by odds . " " I , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , " says Bruce . It never happened when I was pitching , for I picked up the sign myself off the bench , or off Coker or Perry , and I talked some of the pitchers into doing the same . But you can not ask a pitcher to be looking 4 ways for their sign . They have got enough to think about without protecting their catcher . Dutch looked at me funny a couple times , staring at me , his face saying , " Author , what is the secret locked in your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Atlanta he hit a home run one night off a right-hand pitcher name of Hrabak , now with Detroit , that probably went 475 feet in the air . It was a cold night , not much of a crowd , and you heard it go " Ping ! " in the street beyond , and hit lefthanders , too , which Jonah Brooks do n't even hit as much as he hits right-handers , which is hardly any to begin with , and begun hitting the same boys over again , even thoughp84Philly kept a book on him now , leaning in more , his jaw working , saying over and over to himself , " This son of a bitch is only a country boy like me , or else a country boy from the city , " looking fiercer , a big chew in his cheek and his bat gripped tight , though later Pasquale told him loosen up , and a smart thing , too . One day in Knoxville against Philly he seen how they played him deep down the left side , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit not only with his bat but also with his head , and he beat it out easy . Philly never played him too deep any more after that , and more than one hit he blasted through third that the third basemanmight of handled if he been deeper but was afraid to play too deep for fear Bruce would bunt again . It did not need a genius to think this up , but for Bruce it was unusual , and maybe Dutch said to himself , " Is it possible that Pearson is waking up at last from his sleep of years ? " I do n't know . I mean I do n't know if that is what Dutch said or not . All I know is this kind of a thing probably kept him from getting too goddam upset over keeping Bruce . He never jumped up in the air and kicked his heels , I suppose , nor ever said a good word to Bruce , nor ever spoke to him when he seen him around . But he carried him along . To him Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly even remember is there between looks . It was very cold up towards New York . We played one exhibition in Philly , though it was not on the schedule , and the boys all told me bring it up at the winter meetings , and I said I would , for an open date is supposed to be an open date , and I will , too , if I ever get to the winter meetings . But I must finish this cockeyed book first . I sworep85up and down to myself I would finish it or die trying , though to tell you the truth it is impossible to write around the house between the baby and the telephone ringing . It rings a lot these days , ringing all winter after a good year , and what I wind up doing is writing at night , and if the baby cries I snuggle her in bed with Holly , and she feeds her , and I go back and write some more , or sometimes write with one hand and the baby in the other until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily I am a fast writer . Also , I do my own writing , though I been getting calls ever since October 7th from writers saying , " Author , why not go and relax somewheres and leave me polish off your book for you ? " and sometimes the temptation gets me down . But they would louse it up , not meaning to but only pounding it out between the half of a football game or on the corner of a bar , and it must not be loused like that . We hit Philly on a Friday morning , Good Friday , and pulled out that night . I pitched 7 innings , my last turn before the Opener . Canada played first base because Sid went home for the beginning of Passover , and Reed McGonigletook over in center field , joining us not 2 hours before game time , still in his army suit but officially sprung . Everybody was glad to see him , Dutch especially , for it meant we could carry 26 , and he was in shape , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Piney Woods was cut loose the same day , headed back to the QC Cowboys with his airplane ticket sticking up out of his pocket and stopping at my locker the last thing and saying , " Author , give Coker back the other 20 , " and I said I would , though actually Coker never give it to me , and I said , " Piney , I have a feeling you will be up in a year or 2p86as soon as Mike learns you to keep your mind on business and not on motorcycles and such foolishness as that . " " I love motorcycles , " he said . " You are 19 , " I said . " You will get over it , " and he stood up and looked brave and said , " Well , maybe somebody will drop dead soon and open up a slot for me . " " Leave us hope so , " I said , and he went out the door . Jonah caught , and it was a pleasure pitching to him . Now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce there , and I thought how impossible it was , though sometimes I shook my mind off it , saying , " Well , Bruce now and all the rest of us later , so what the hell difference does it really make ? " though I could never really convince myself any way you look at it . Dying old is in the cards , and you figure on it , and it happens to everybody , and you are willing to swallow it . But why should it happen young to Bruce ? It made me mad . I went my full 7 with never a hitch , and Dutch sat on the bench , leaning back on his hands and smiling . I sweated something awful , still weighing heavy , and this kid fanned me between innings , Diego Roberto or Roberto Diego , whatever his name was , the kid we carried for George . " Mister , " he said , " you pitch tight baseball like hot stuff . " He went back to Cuba when Red come back , for Red can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , though not too hard with either one , and he sometimes threw batting practice . I liked it when he did , for I could hit him . We wound up the weekend and the spring with 2 with Philly at home , and Sunday night me and Joe sat around about an hour dealing Tegwar without even a nibble.  |p87There  was too much excitement in the air , the lobby full of i , 000,000 people saying , " Glad to see you back , boys , " and saying they knew it was our year again , and slapping you on the back . Joe was awful put out . I told him forget it , there would be happy times ahead when things settled down , and he said he supposed so . Bruce went up to Katie 's and come back and seen us there and said , " Why not 3-hand Tegwar just between ourself ? " and Joe give him a look . Monday we drilled light and left for Boston . We were a strong club . We had the best left-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little thin boy you doubt can carry his hat , no speed but a lot of breaking stuff , and top control . We had strong right-hand pitching . We had good relief if Horse and Keith come through . We had the best outfield in baseball , bar none , and the best double-play combination in Coker and Perry . We had good , solid right-hand hitting , and we had tremendous lef thandpower if Sid and Pasquale both had a good year . But we had weak catching and a weak bench , Goose old and fading , Bruce never reliable , and Jonah no hitter . The bench was young and not yet ripe . I floated $250 on the Mammoths to win in a little pool run by a crook name of Suss Melner in the lobby , but he give it back to me when we come down again from Boston , saying , " No takers , Author . " On the following couple pages I am throwing in the roster , which I done the same in " The Southpaw " and receivedmany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it helped them follow whose who . It seems crazy to me because I know the boys like the back of my book , whatp88their voice is like and how they walk and talk and eat and comb their hair , how they stand in at the plate , how they throw , how they run , how they slide , where they spend their pay , who they hang with , what their wife and kids are like , or their girl . I know their voice through a wall . I can see a waiter in a diner with a tray full of food and pretty much know who ordered it . I know how they bet at poker , and what they smoke , those that do . I know whose rings are which piled in Mick McKinney 's box . Christ , if I see somebody head down on Mick 's table I know them by the callous on their feet . More things I know than this but probably better never mention for fear of getting them in trouble with their wife or their girl or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a book you must remember that everybody do n't know what you might know . Holly says the same . Running down the roster I see where out of the 25 boys on the 52 club that won both the flag and the Series only i6 are back . I also notice where I was the youngest man on the 52 squad but am now older than g others . Canada Smith is listed as an outfielder but also fills in at first base.  |p89OFFICIAL  ROSTERNEW YORK MAMMOTHS BASEBALL CLUB , INC. 1955LESTER T. MOORS , JR .

LORD , SECRETARYp93ON THE way up to Boston all was quiet , especially the new boys , for they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting reading a book Arcturus sent me name of " Widening Your Circle of Acquaintances . " Every book they send you they send a card asking how you like it , and I send the card back , saying , " Good for laughs . " I got more business than I can handle already and do not need to circle my acquaintances . Dutch come past and touched me on the shoulder , saying , " Author , come with me , " and I went back to his room with him and sat down , not knowing what was up and wondering what I done wrong , and he said , " Are you ever planning to get down to your weight ? " But he did not wait for an answer , saying instead , " Did you have your tooth fixed ? " I had a hole in one of my cavities , and I started to say " No , " which was true , for there was too much excitement over the weekend to go sit in the dentist . The club has this dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sundays for Mammothsonly , a Mammoth fan for years and years with a photo on the wall of each and every Mammoth he ever worked on . He has a big photo of Dutch that takes up half one wall that I personally do not consider the happiest94 ! t BANG THE DRUM Slowlyp94thing to be staring you in the face at such a time . " How is the Mrs. coming along ? " he said , which I did not even start to answer now , for I seen it was something else on his mind altogether . " Author , " he said , " Joe tells me you and Pearson been playing Tegwar over the winter . " " Sure , " I said . " Why not ? " " When ? " said Dutch . " Just before camp begun , " said I. " Where ? " said he . " Down at Bruce 's , " said I. " What were you doing down there ? " he said . " You mean besides playing Tegwar ? " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you go there ? " " He always wished me to meet his folks , " said I. " Was the Mrs. with you ? " " Sure , " I said . " You drove down by car ? " " Yes . " " Very well , " said he . " We have got you and your wife by car in Bainbridge , Georgia . Leave us back up to wheneverit was you spoke to Joe on the telephone in Chicago . When was that ? " " I never did , " I said . " You never did ? Are you telling me Joe is a liar ? " " No , " said I. " I never spoke to Joe . I suppose what he means is I spoke to his Mrs. " " Yes , you know very goddam well what he probably means . Do not stall , Author , for you are stalling the wrong man . When was it ? " " Probably around in January , " I said . " What were you doing in Chicago ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes , " said I. " For where ? " " For Minnesota . " " Where in Minnesota ? " " Minneapolis . " " What was up ? " " Insurance matters , " I said . " Name me somebody you planned seeing on insurance matters in Minneapolis . " " Aleck Olson , " said I.Dutch dug the Boston book out of his bag and looked up Aleck and threw the book on the bed . " Did you sell him ? " " I believe it is only a matter of time , " I said . " This is all a lie , " he said . " No , it is no lie , " I said . " I got a feeling that these little statements are true , " he said , " but what they add up to is one big lie . Am I right ? " " About what ? " " About the feeling I got ? " he said . " I do not know what kind of a feeling you got , " said I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you do . " He laughed . " Get out , " he said . " I sure wish you could be wrapped in a sack and tossed in the river , all except your left arm . " The first thing I done at the park Tuesday was race over to the Boston clubhouse . The boys were all sitting around eating bananas . " Where did you get all the bananas ? " I said . " Off a tree , " they said , and somebody threw me one . " What in hell you doing in here ? " said Alf Keller . " Get the hell out . "  | " I just come over to use your scale , " I said . " What kind of a cheap management is it that got no scale in the visiting clubhouse ? " " What you need is a truck scale , " said Alf . " What you need is a ball club , " said I. I stepped on the scale . " Alf , I know where you can pick up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale said " 211  --  " and I threw my banana away . " What you need I already got , " said he . " Aleck , " said I , " could I see you a minute ? " and we stepped out in the alley , and before I said anything he said , " Dutch called me . " " What did he say ? " I said . " He asked me what you done in Minneapolis . I told him you bought a coat was all I remembered . He asked me if I bought insurance off you , and I said no , not yet . I think I will buy some . " " Never mind that now , " I said . " What else did he say ? " " What is up , Author ? " said Aleck . " I told him nothing if I could help it . If I knew what was up I could tell him the right thing . He asked me where you went . I said you got on the bus to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to see Pearson ? " " I do not remember . I figured if you got on the Rochesterbus you were going to Rochester . " " Ai n't there places between Minneapolis and Rochester you might be going to see a man at ? " " Only Cannon Falls , " he said . " It happens that was where I seen Pearson , " I said . " OK , OK , " he said . " Do not be mad at me . Only what in hell would anybody be seeing anybody in Cannon Falls for ? "  | " You might be going fishing , " I said . " In what ? " he said . " In 9 feet of ice ? " " Hunting ? " " Yes , " he said , " you might be going hunting at that , though you would be more libel to go up north hunting . That is where everybody goes . Have you boys got a girl in Minnesota ? " " That is just where I would not wish to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all packed in like sardines . " " Packed in in all them woods ! You might go days without seeing a soul . Many a man froze to death up there before they found him . " " Thanks , " I said . " For what ? " he said . " Listen , Author , I wish to talk to you about the annuity . " " Some other time , " I said , and I went out and warmed . It was the fourth straight Opener I worked . Sam Yale worked 14 in a row until I nudged him out of the spot in 52 . I do not know why Dutch always likes left-handers against Boston , but he does . They used to be weak against left-handers , but not any more . Now they are weak , but not especially against left-handers , and if I been Dutch I would of saved me and Van Gundy more for somebody else and threw right-hand pitching at Boston . However , I am not Dutch . The first ball I pitched Aleck Olson lined it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long one , and I said to myself , " This is a great way to start the year . " Keith Crane got up off the bench and slung his jacket over his shoulder and started down to the bullpen , Bruce followingp98along behind . Dutch stood up and took a bat out of the rack and begun tapping the handle on the step , like a drum , ba-da-dum , ba-da-dum , ba-da-dum-dum-dum , like the Lone Ranger 's horse , Hiyo Silver , away . He breaks about 4 bats like that a year . Jonah come down the line with a new ball , squeezing it so little and white in those big hands , and the infield gathered around and gassed , and then they all went back to their spots except Jonah . He stood there a minute , rubbing the ball , not saying a word , only giving you the idea that nothing in the world happened worth talking about , then turning and hustling back up the line again . He never lets his worry show . He is steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , and if you doubt him he knows that , too , reads your mind , and he sings , " Do not doubt Jonah . Last man that doubted Jonah wound up in the poorhouse , " and you throw and do not doubt . He is the most under-rated man in baseball today , as me and the Mammoths know , and nobody else , and we got the son of a bitches out after that , 1-2-3 . Keith and Bruce put their jacket on again , for it was cold up there , and sat down in the bullpen . Dutch put the bat back in the rack . And Sid tied it up a minute later with a blow that sailed twice as far back in the stands as Aleck 's ever done , and the ball game was new . Then soon it was not new any more , neither , but ours , for the power was on , the boys all hitting solid and steady , though a couple times when we really got moving the tail end come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queeringthings , not only then but later in the summer , too . You are not libel to find 2 weaker hitters in a row anywheres . Jonah tries . I will say that . I myself pretty much give up even trying any more . We were ahead 6  --  2 in the eighth ,  |p99which  you might of still called a ball game until Perry and Pasquale both got on and Sid hit another , and it was 9  --  2 and everybody in the stands that did n't already freeze to death went home and probably never come back the rest of the year . We won on Wednesday , too , which was colder yet , Van Gundy throwing these soft little hooks and sinkers all day that from anywheres in the park look like a sick child served them up underhand . I seen more articles all summercalled WHY CAN NOBODY HIT VAN GUNDY ? than any other kind except WILL SID GOLDMAN BE THE MAN TO BUST BABE RUTH 'S RECORD ? Sid hit another that day , which was 3 , and we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a porter name of Marty told me Dutch wished to see me , and I went back to his room again , saying over and over to myself , " Cannon Falls , Cannon Falls . " He was laying on the bed all naked with the sheet up over him , the Brooklyn book beside him , his hands back under his head and a cigarette in his mouth . The ashes kept falling down on his chest . " Ai n't you afraid of burning a hole in your chest ? " I said . He never answered , never even looked at me in the beginning , only stared up . " I lay here reading the Brooklyn book , " he said . " I keep trying to figure the son of a bitches out . But then do you know who I wind up thinking about ? I wind up thinking about Wiggen and Pearson . Goddam it , Author , you told me you went back home from Minneapolis . " " So it is this again ? " said I. " No sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " You give me to believe it , " he said . " And that is the same thing . Did you see Olson ? "  | " Did I see Olson ? " I said . " The son of a bitch hit a home run off me . " " You know what I mean . " " Sure I seen Olson . " " What about ? " " Insurance matters . By the way , he mentioned you called him . Dutch , I would rather you did not push this thing too far . " " Why not ? " " Because it is a personal matter , " said I. I got up and locked the door . " Flip up the bowl , " he said , and I flipped it up and he tossed his cigarette in and turned over on his side now . " How so ? " he said . " Well , Dutch , " said I , " you will probably think I am a heel and all that , but there is this airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary , " I said . " Mary what ? Jones or Smith or Brown ? " " Mary Pistologlione , " I said . " So , " he said . " Go on . I am trying hard to believe this . OK , so you fiddle along between Chicago and Minneapolis , and then you get on the bus in Minneapolis and go where ? " " Did not Olson tell you ? " " You tell me . " " Down to Cannon Falls , " I said . " What for ? " " To hunt . " " You never hunt . What kind of a gun do you shoot ? " " No kind , " I said . " I only went because Pearson asked me to . "  | " What did you catch ? " " Nothing . We changed our mind and went back . " " Back where ? " " Home , him to Georgia and me to Perkinsville . " " I am sure you have drilled him up to the eyes , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds from him anyway . You sit right there . " He rung for the porter . " How did he come up to Minnesota ? Drive by car did he ? " " Yes sir . " The porter banged on the door . " Tell him go get Pearson , " Dutch said . " I do not believe this cockeyed bull story about your friend Mary for a single minute , but if it is true you are making a mistake . Anybody with a wife like yours must count his blessings . " Bruce walked in , and Dutch laid over on his back again and lit up another cigarette and reached under the bed and stuck the match in the spring . " How much money you owe Author , Pearson ? " " I owe him nothing , " said Bruce . " Arthur , do I owe you any money ? " He looked at me quite hurt . " What train did you go up to Minnesota in ? " said Dutch . " No train sir . In my car . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell me what it is like . " " It is pretty nice , " said Bruce , " with a main drag and stores but very cold . We could not fish . The ice was 9 feet . We went hunting . " " What did you shoot ? " said Dutch . " Not so many niggers up there neither . " " I asked you what you shot . " " Nothing sir . We started hunting and changed my mind . I did not feel like killing anything any more . "  | " That knocks the hell out of hunting , " said Dutch . " Yes sir , " said Bruce . " I guess it does . " " Then where did you go from Minnesota ? " said Dutch . " Back home . " " Alone ? " " Yes . " " You are sure ? " " Yes sir . Were we not , Arthur ? " " Were who not ? " said Dutch , sitting up in bed all of a sudden . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down from Minnesota by car ? " " Yes sir . " " Flip up the bowl again , " said Dutch , and I flipped it up and he tossed the butt in . " Now , Author , I believe we might be heading towards something at last , for 2 nights ago on this same identical train I said to you who drove your car down to Bainbridge , and you said you and your wife did , but now I hear something else again . Did you go down there and back home for your wife ? Or did her and Mary Pistologlione maybe drive down together with Aleck Olson ? Or in other words what in hell is going on here anyways , because you know as sure as your name that I am going to get to the bottom of this or kill myself doing it , " and while he was talking my mind was whirling , and I let her whirl , and when he stopped I busted out laughing , saying , " Well , Dutch , the whole joke is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , " said he . " Because if you will back the whole thing up , " said I , " you will remember that I called you on the telephone duringthis time and give you a little patter and told you I was up home when where we were we were right downtownp103in St. Louis . We would of went out and seen you but were not shaved and did not wish to see the Mrs. like that and finally made a gag out of it all . You can understand me not wishing to give away a gag that I might wish to try another time on somebody else . " I was laughing , but Dutch was not . " This does not explain everything , " he said . " It leaves me in the dark on a number of counts . " He leaned back and laughed a little , though not hard , and he seen the Brooklyn book and picked it up and begun studying it . After awhile he said , " Get out . " When he really thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nor never could be . He always knew it was a phony story , but he never knew just where . The one big thing on my side was he thinks I am out of my mind to start with.  |p104SID  HIT a home run in the tenth inning Thursday , Number 4 , and we beat Brooklyn , and Friday was the last day of Passover and he was out of the lineup again . Dutch give us a lecture before the Friday game , saying we had all the power in the world and could whip along without Sid , but Goose caught , for power , and we lost , and Dutch swore there would be no more Passover clauses in anybody'scontract . " Why in hell does it never rain on Passover ? " he said . He was blowing his fume all over the place , the first time yet , and it made the new boys extremely nervous . I told them it happened every other day , 77 times a summer , and they said it must be quite a strain being on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags , " said Ugly . " Mike Mulrooney wins flags , " said Lawyer Longabucco , " and he hardly ever speaks above a whisper . " " You are in the big time now , son , " said Ugly , " and you must get used to getting eat out in a big-time way . " " Yet it seems to me , " said Lawyer , " that I have got no business getting eat out because Sid went home for Pass-over . " " Do not always be a lawyer , " said Ugly , which was how Lawyer Longabucco got his name.  |p105Sid  himself probably never heard a word from Dutch on the subject . He was back Saturday when Boston hit town , and Dutch forgets Friday when Saturday comes , new day , new ball game . Yesterday is in the books , dead and buried . He remembers old grudges from years and years , but he forgets yesterday and leaves you start each new day with a fresh slate and anyhow never eats Sid out much because Sid is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must be kept calm and not stirred up . Once in the park he is always after calmness . He will walk away from a discussion . He will never talk to writers nor fans nor even the boys much but only come up out of the alley and stand studying the bats one after the other , though then always grab the same bat , a Tommy Joyce Special . There are about 3 different types of Sid Goldman bats on the market , but I never seen him use one . Then he strolls up and stands by the cage and watches , and then he slowly steps in for his swipes . He takes a year or more to get his feet set . Then he tilts back a little , his knees bent , the bat resting on his shoulder until the pitcher pumps and you are ready to scream , " Christ Almighty , take the bat off your shoulder ! " But he never does until the pitch starts through , and then the bat comes off , and eyes and wrists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye in baseball today . In Sid 's languagethere is no such a thing as " Almost " but only " Yes " or " No , " where every pitch must be in there or else he will give it the go-by . A man must pitch to him or lose him , and when he sees what he likes he picks it out , and the wrists come around with the power behind it driving up from his toes the whole length of him . No matter if he only skies out , he skies high , but if he tags it square it isp106gone , and either way his face shows nothing , calm , never a smile nor a frown , and off the field the same , no monkeyplaybut only quiet cards or the pinball machine or a magazine in the lobby . When he is hitting he rides the lobby watching the world go by , and when he is not he stays put in his room seeing nobody , only sitting in his shorts and looking in the mirror and wondering why . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a girl and in Chicago a brother or a cousin , and elsewhere he rooms with Lindon Burke . He dragged me and Lindon to a big blowout for some kind of a charitable outfit in Cleveland one night , and the women tore the joint down getting at him . He walked out of it , saying he could not stand it . It took his mind off . When the time come for the big speech the m.c. looked around for Sid , and he was gone , and I give it instead , saying we must all get behind and push , though never knowing what for nor how much they needed nor why nor when . He is a great drawing card and should have a better contract , but he does not think about it , only signs it and shoves it back in the box . He thinks about nothing , only his hitting . He walks in the clubhouse with the paper in his pocket and sits down and opens it and sees who the probable starter for the other club is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable starter and gets undressed and sits down in his jock again and thinks about it some more . Then he gets dressed and goes to the phone and calls the press-box and says , " Who is this ? " and whoever answers Sid says , " I seen in your paper where So-and-so is the probable starter and wish to know is this the latest . " Then he sticks his cap on his head and goes down the alley thinking about it.  |p107I  worked that Saturday with 3 days rest and my weight down to 210 1/2 , hooked up with Murtha , the same boy I beat Opening Day , in a ball game I will never soon forget . It was 2  --  2 moving along into the eighth when Dutch sent Bruce up to hit for me , the wind being right . I did not like being lifted , though what I like and do not like is a small thing to Dutch . Bruce got hold of one he liked and slammed it in left , one base . I thought , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weighed myself and was down to 208 and went back out and seen Bruce standing on second dustinghimself off . George was still at the plate , and I said , " Wild pitch ? " " No , " said Coker . " He stole . " " He stole , " I said . " Without no sign , " said Coker . " Without no sign , " said I. " God save his skin , " said Coker . I looked at Dutch and he looked at me . Then he looked away . " Glee , " he said , " go run for Pearson , " and Harry Glee jumped up off the bench , his first big-time ball game , and Bruce come trotting in until when he was in front of the dugout he suddenly seen Dutch and changed his mind and circled around , down in the dugout at the far end , near the bubbler , and he kept right on trotting through the door and down the alley . The boys all laughed , and even Dutch laughed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , but no go , and he was tossed out at first , but Glee went on to third and come home a couple pitches later when Perry lifted a long fly that Aleck Olson gathered in on the run and dug and spun and made the try on Glee but never had a chance . Keith Cranep108blanked Boston in the ninth and we took it , 3-2 , our fourth win in 5 starts . He was in the shower singingYes , we have no bananas , We have no bananas today . " Bananas ai n't all he is not libel to have pretty soon , " said Perry . He begun to sing , Perry did , and we got the quartet going , and when we cleared out from the shower Bruce was still in there . Dutch come out of his office and stood on the scale and waited . Nobody could weigh theirself with him on the scale , though I guess nobody wished to . " Who is still in the shower ? " said Dutch , and from the shower come Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he come out then , and everybody shoved over and left him a wide place to sit . " Now boys , " said Dutch , " every once in awhile there must be a certain amount of going back over things which people forgot in the meantime , such as the 2 things which are going to cost people money if they do not remember them and obey . " He then listed them off . How many times in my life did I hear them ! There are 2 things you will get eat out for . The eating out is worse than the money1 . Missing your sign. 2 . Not obeying orders . Number One is mostly what you get eat out for , since if you do Number 2 you always claim Number One anyhow . " Now Pearson , " he said , " will you please tell me how come you missed your sign ? What is the runner 's sign for stealing ? "  | " Walloping your toe with the fat of the bat , " said Bruce . " Very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walloping my toe ? " " No sir , " said Bruce . " Probably he thought he seen you , " said I. " No sir , " said Bruce . " I just stole . " " Probably somebody else in along there on the bench was playing around with a bat was what Pearson thought he seen , " said Sid . " Probably I might of been playing around with a bat myself , " said Vincent . " No sir , " said Bruce . " I only figured this murder was easy to steal off . " " Whatwhat ? " said Dutch . " Whatwhat ? " " I was watching murder all Tuesday and seen how you might steal off him , " said Bruce . Dutch looked at me . " Author , " he said , " can you make heads or tails out of this ? " " He means Murtha , " said I. " What about him ? " said Dutch . " I was watching him all Tuesday , " said Bruce . " He looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forward leg murder thinks you are bluffing him and pays you no mind . If the runner is leaning backwards on the other leg he holds you close . " " Is that so ? " said Dutch . " Who told you this ? It is the most thinking you figured out since Hector was a coon . Roberto , put it in Spanish for George . " " Yes sir , Mister , " said Diego Roberto or Roberto Diego , whatever his name was , " George says pardon she for spoking but one stupid thing was never such hot-stuff baseball sending Pearson to stole a base . "  | " Tell George this is the same subject we are now discussing , " said Dutch . Roberto spoke in Spanish to George , and they laughed , and then George said it back to Roberto , and Roberto said it back in English to Dutch , which is how Dutch keeps a check on George . I actually believe George could speak English if he wished to by now , but I guess he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballplayer tell him before that he done Number 2 . Ugly says in more than 10 years under Dutch he never seen it neither . Dutch finally said , " It will cost you $ioo , Pearson , " not loud nor mad but very mild like a fellow just trying to talk after somebody belted him in the stomach . " Yes sir , " said Bruce . " I am sorry if it hurts , " said Dutch , " but things that do you good have got to hurt . " " That is all right , " said Bruce . " It does not hurt . " " Does not hurt ? " said Dutch . " It is 5 trips to Katie'sdown a rat-hole . If it does not hurt I will make it 200 . " " What he means , " said I , " is it does not hurt much .

" " I am not asking you , " said Dutch . " I am asking him . Can he not speak for himself ? Is that a lesson ? If it is not a lesson my breath is wasted . " " No sir , " said Bruce . " It is not a lesson ? " said Dutch . " He means no you are not wasting your breath , " said I , " but yes it is a lesson . I can tell you the 50 will hurt him plenty . "  | " I hope so , " said Dutch , and he give Bruce one last look and turned and went back in his office , and in the end he kicked Bruce back the other 50 , too , for we stole Boston blind when Murtha worked , though Bruce never missed the 50 when he lost it nor was glad to see it when it come back nor would not of cared if it been 100 , nor 200 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sunday we split 2 with Boston . Sid busted up the first game with a home run , and Washington come to town on Monday after a happy week spent whaling Boston and Brooklyn , sitting on top of the league , which anybody could do easy enough if that was all that stood in their way . On paper Washington was no ball club and still is n't and never will as far as I can see , and Herb Macy beat them Monday and we moved up in a tie , and everybody now figured Washington had all the view they were libel to have all year of the top spot . Around 10 the next morning the bellboy banged on the door with a note sealed in an envelope from Katie saying could she see me strictly alone in this certain restaurant , and I put on my pants and went . It was warming up , and the sun was hot in front of the hotel . The cabbie said , " Well , it sure looks good to see us up on top where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure been hitting , " he said . " He is 4 ahead of Babe Ruth according to the paper . " I said he was . " You pitching today ? " he said . I said no . " Washington can not last , " he said . Nobody was there but Katie and the bartender and a colored fellow mopping the floor , the first time I seen her since 53 when me and Holly had this place on 66 Street , and she looked the same , and I said so . " You are lookingp112extremely lovely as usual , " I said . She was drinking a beer with one glove on and one off . On her meat hand she wore a wedding ring . " Have a beer , " she said . " No thanks , " I said , " but I think I could go for a bite of breakfast . " " Order up , " she said , and I done so . " I was out the park Saturday , " she said . " I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce in there for once . He done fine , did he not ? " " Yes he did , " I said . " How much did you finally sign for ? " " 25,000 , " I said . " How much does Bruce draw ? " she said. " 15,425 , " I said . " No , " she said . " Katie , " I said , " state your business . What is up ? " The man brung me my breakfast and she whipped a 20 off the stack . We carried my dishes over to a table , for she thought the bartender was looking too curious . She does not trust anybody much . She spoke very low . " What is wrong with Bruce ? " she said . " Who says anything is ? " I said . " He says , " she said . " Well , what did he say ? " " He only said he was up in Minnesota , and then he clammed up . He says marry him and cash in on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " You get that way sitting on the bench too many years . He had pneumonia . " " What would you go all the way up to Minnesota with pneumonia for ? " she said.  | " Whatever it is it is not catching , " I said , " so forget it . Do you think I would risk rooming with him if it was anythingserious ? " " Rooming with him is one thing , " she said . " It is not catching , " I said . " Is not ? " she said . " Was not , " said I. " He sure thinks the world of you , " she said . " He thinks you are the best friend a man could ever have . His idea of Heaven is me and you and him rooming together . " " That does not appeal to me , " I said . " One of us has got to go . " " Why do you not ever drop up ? " she said . " I am a married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said I. " Why not get married , Katie , and raise yourselfsome exemptions ? " " To who ? " she said . " And for what ? Why do you not play baseball for free , Author ? Why should a girl go amateurwhen she has got the stuff to be professional ? I do not see why you can not tell me what he had . You know , he is a nice boy , but a fool . I see myself in Bainbridge , Georgia , hanging up the wash and singing in the church , where maybe if I am a good girl he will leave me dig in the fields if the horse gives out and get up early and milk the cow . " " Fresh milk tastes good early in the morning , " I said . " Leave the milkman taste it , " she said . " Can I drop you ? " " At the park , " I said , and we hopped in a cab . " To the Stadium , " she said , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror until he finally told me who I was and started through the detailsp114of the present situation , Washington would fold and Goldmanwas 4 ahead of Babe Ruth and he was glad to see McGonigle back out of the army , and she said to me , " How many thousands of clucks do you think there are to the square mile ? " I said I did not know . " If I was to marry , " she said , " I would marry a man of over 8o in rocky health with a wad as thick as a mattress . " I begun singing " Mother , " singing " M is for the million things you give me , 0 is for your only growing old , " and she laughed . " But I am far from marrying , " she said , " though the offers roll in every day . I have ioo men on the line that draw down a good bit more than a third-string catcher . " " I believe you , " I said , which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good , or so I hear , and I hopped out , saying " Thanks for the lift , " and she blew me a kiss and said " Good luck , " and I said " See you around , " which is what you say to people you hope you seen the last of . We beat Washington that day , which was getaway day , Blondie Biggs going most of the distance but needing help from F.D.R. in the ninth , and we went down to Washingtonon the same train in first place , no strings attached . A little ways out of New York Joe come up the isle and said to me , " Quick , Author , while Pearson is dozing off , " and we went back a couple cars where Washington was . We begun dealing , straight Casino for maybe 15 minutes until along come this freckle-face boy name of Sampson Opper , an outfielder , his first year up from the farms , a good ballplayer . I believe he can get rid of the ball faster than anybody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could of wore a sign saying I AM A BIGTIMEBALLPLAYER NOW in 3 different colors he would of done so , and had it tattooed across his head . He stood behindJoe with his hands in his belt and watched and finally said , " Casino ? " Joe finished the hand and turned around and give Opper a quick look . " Hello son , " he said . " You traveling all by yourself ? " Then we played another hand , and Opper moved down beside the table so Joe could see him better . But we never looked up , only played Casino again , and Opper said , " I do not suppose you would mind a third person . " " No , " said Joe , " go see if one of the ballplayers wishes to sit in . " " I am a ballplayer , " said Opper . " Is that so ? " said Joe , still never looking up . " Good luck to you , son . Do not drink nor smoke nor gamble for money and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ready . " " I am Sampson Opper , " said he , and he sat , but we did not deal him in . Instead we went into Tegwar now , no rules a-tall , and Opper was kind of glad he did not put his cash on the table . But we went back to Casino then , and he pulled his cash out of his pocket , and we played one hand of Casino and one of Tegwar , first one and then the other , and he kept tapping his fingers on his money , decidingif he should leave it on the table or put it back and get up and out , and the boys begun to gather , not only Washington but many of the Mammoths down from our own car , standing in a crowd behind us like a crowd around an accident , some of the boys standing on the seats to see until all of a sudden we dealed him in , and he was inp116if he liked it or not , and he said , " What in hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Joe . " I am not sure if I am clear on some of the new rules , " said Opper . " What new rules ? " said Joe . " There ai n't been a rule changed since the Black Sox scandal . Big League Tegwar is Big League Tegwar , known to every big-time ballplayer from Boston to Kansas City , " and he went on and on , how it was first played among ballplayers in the days of the underhand pitch , and passed along from club to club and father to son until there was nobody that did not know it , not the lowest punk on the lowest cellar club , and yet it was known to ballplayers , and ballplayers only , once they made the grade , and we kept dealing and saying , " That will be 14 cents to Joe and 12 cents to Author , " and Opper kept shoving the money at us , and everybody was beginning to bust , yet silent , everybody there now , both clubs , and I would of begun busting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said nothing to me , though yet he said , " That was a fine thing , Arthur , to run off and play Tegwar when I was dozing , " and I said to Joe , " I think Bruce Pearson wishes to play . " " 3 is enough , " said Joe . " Then leave him sit in for me , " I said . " No ! " said Joe . " No ! No ! What are you 2 anyway ? Are you Romeo and Juliet ? " " Then I must quit , " said I , and I turned my cards over and rose up and pushed back through the crowd . " I will make you sorry for this , " said Joe , and he called me a couple dirty names again , and Romeo and Juliet , and he also later made me sorry.  |p117But  I do not know what else I could of done . I was sorry to quit but would of been sorrier still if I stood and played , one of those cockeyed deals where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , like the old-time riddle where the fellow says , " Suppose you were up to your neck in a barrel of shit and a fellow was tossing baseballs at you . What do you do ? Do you duck ? "  |p118WE  BEAT Washington Wednesday night , our first night game , and Thursday afternoon , which meant we now beat them 4 times in 4 starts . We beat them i6 times in 22 starts all summer , leaving no doubt in my mind which was the best ball club . The reason they stood up there all year was they fatted up on the second division . They beat Boston 17 times and Brooklyn i8 and Chicago 2o , though we had no idea in the very beginning but kept looking over our shoulder at Cleveland and Pittsburgh and even St. Louis and wondering who we had to beat , never figuring it would be Washington . I beat Brooklyn Sunday , 6-4 , not the best ball game I ever pitched if I do say so myself . Sid made me a gift of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 4 up on Babe Ruth . He was pretty sick and tired hearing about Babe Ruth . " I am Sid Goldman and not Babe Ruth , " he said , " and I would appreciate everybody keeping their trap shut in the matter , " which we done , though of course the paper done no such a thing but hauled out the records every time Sid connected . Holly says there might be a few people do not know who Babe Ruth was . Babe Ruth hit 6o homep119runs in 1927 , before I was even born , the most home runs anybody ever hit . I seen in the paper where Dutch was worried about Jonah Brooks not getting a base hit since the seventh inning Tuesday , April 19 , though if he was it did not show . Jonah caught all through April until the second game of a Sunday doubleheader with Pittsburgh , which Bruce caught , the first complete game he caught since Thursday , July 9 , 1954 , according to the paper . He done well . I pitched and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets the faster I look . He missed a couple signs but he banged out 2 hits , one a double , and was now batting 500 on the year , 6 for 3 , his name at the top of the Sunday averages . It was the fourth game I won with the year nowheres even begun practically . I was beginning to get the sniff of that old bonus clause . However , Jonah was back in the lineup Tuesday night against Chicago , and then we wound up the home stand beating Washington 2 out of 3 over Friday and the weekend . Sid hit Number g and 10 and we went west 3  --  games on top . He was still 4 up on Babe Ruth . Why should n't Dutch of kept Jonah playing , though the paper kept crying " Weak stick , weak stick " and writing long articles about it if Sid did n't happen to hit a home run for them to quick drag out Babe Ruth all over again instead ? The power was on and the pitching was steady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept tinkering all right , but not with Jonah . He kept juggling the order , and when that did n't work he kept juggling the bench , now yanking Canada and playing McGonigle , now yanking Vincent and playing Lawyer Longa/bucco , once even playing McGonigle in left though I know he would almost rather die than use a left-hander there , now yanking Coker and Perry and playing Ugly at short and Tyler or Wash Washburn at second , seeing what I seen and what the boys would of also seen if they cut out the horseshit long enough and what the paper would of seen if they ever stopped looking up Babe Ruth . It was not pulling like a club . It was 2  --  and 3 and 3  --  on top all through the west , but it should of been 4  --  or 5 by now . It was firing along because me and Sid and Pasquale and Van Gundy and Herb Macy were turning in the work , but you can not go all the way on a few bats or a few arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a club , which I personally blame on Joe Jaros to begin with and Goose and Horse and the 4 colored boys and everybody else that could n't get in the act quick enough , thinking they had the flag in their pocket in May and looking around for amusement , thinking it was amusement when what it was was horseshit pure and simple . Every time he seen us he said , " Romeo and Juliet , " and I laughed , and after he said it about 20,000 times I said , " Joe , I will leave you in on a little secret . After the first 20,000 times a joke stops being funny all of a sudden . " But he kept on , and when he called me " Romeo " I called him " Grandfather , " which he is proud to be except if you say it that certain way , and he stopped for a couple days and then called me " Romeo " again , and I said , " Romeo was a great lover , Joe . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe you can buy these little pills give you back your pep in bed you lost when you were young like me , " and he said , " You mind your tongue , boy , and be careful how you rag your elders . "  | " Do not pull your rank on me , " I said . " Give is give and take is take . " Ugly said the same . It must of been Ugly passed the word along to Dutch because I know Ugly and Joe did n't speak for awhile . Dutch put the squelch on Joe . But he was mad and lonely . He walked around with a deck of cards in his pocket and nobody to play Tegwar with . Bruce never minded . He said , " They love to rag us , Arthur , " and I said they did , and I waited for him to discoverthey were n't ragging me , only him . It takes him longer than most to discover a thing like that . Call me a name and I call you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , but call Bruce a name and he can never think of one to call you back . It is easy pickings , like punchinga punching bag that can not punch back . Maybe it would be a smart move some time to string up a bag in the clubhouse and leave people punch it when their gripe is on . Horse and Goose picked it up , calling him " Juliet " and raking up all the oldest gags in the world , saying , " How tall are you , Pearson ? " and he said " 5 ' 11 ' , " and they said , " We never seen a pile of shit so high before , " or saying , " By the way , Bruce , what is your whole complete name ? " and he said , " Bruce William Pearson , Jr. , " and they said , " Well , up yours , Bruce William Pearson , Jr. , " until quite a number of the boys told Goose and Horse why not cut out the horseshit and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of these days we are going to start looking around behind us for Washington , but they will not be there because they will be up ahead of us , " which was true , for we could not shake them off . " It is a club of crying kids , " said Horse . " It ai n't the old Mammoths. "  | " If you rag them they run and tell Dutch , " said Goose . " The game is gone to hell , and I am glad to be fading from the scene . " " Why not just fade quiet ? " said Coker . " Why not just shut your Polack mouth ? " said Goose , " before I plaster it shut ? " " Why not try ? " said Coker , and he stood up , and Goose stood up . But nothing come of it . Goose hit 35 last summer . He was drinking quite a bit , borrowing 5 here and 5 there and going off alone and drinking it up and waking up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench in St. Louis , and Dutch seen him and begun to say something but then only turned around again . What would of been the use ? Holly says , " Henry , people will wonder how boys get such names as " Goose " and " Horse " and " Piss " . You must tell them . " " It is all in " The Southpaw " , " I said . " Then tell them the pages , " she said , and I said I would , and I spent about an hour flipping through the pages and could not find where I said it , though I know I did . I guess I ought to know . " You find the pages , " I said , " and write them down . " " That is all I have on my mind , " she said . " I have washing and dipering the baby to do , and your mail to answerand your tax to be figuring out and your insurance racket and your food and your car to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering all day , and now all I am supposed to do is start reading your book all over again . "  | " Do you wish me to finish this book before the winter meetings ? " I said . " If so , find the goddam pages . " " I will not , " she said , which she must of meant because she never did . " And do not swear around the baby . " " When she is old enough to understand I will stop , " I said , and I will , or at least I hope I will , though I do not always do everything . All winter all I was going to do was lay around and play with the baby , and then I never done so . I will certainly do it next winter or die trying . We come back from the first swing west by way of Washington , 3 games on top , and Dutch said in the Washingtonclubhouse , " Boys , tonight we start shaking the son of a bitches loose for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me they are like a fly buzzing around your head , where you sit and watch it awhile without ever raising your hand against it . " He jumped off the scale and pulled up a chair and sat down . " Like this , " he said , sitting with his arms folded across his letters and his eyes looking at the ceiling , watchingthat fly go back and forth . " B-z-z-z-z , " he said . " Go ahead , you old Washington fly . Buzz me one more time and I will snatch you out of the air , and you will buzz no more . " From over in George 's corner comes the sound of a buzzing . It is Roberto Diego going , " B-z-z-z-z , B-z-z-z-z , " putting it in Spanish for George . Red never does it like that . Dutch might talk for 5 minutes , and then Red boils it all down to 15 words , but not Diego . He must give it the full treatment , and when he was done George give it back to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dutch to Diego . " This is not so muchp124for George as for certain other persons to begin with . B-z-z-z-z goes the fly until you say to yourself , " Enough is enough . I have give you over a month now to trail along 2  --  and 3 and 3  --  games behind , and now I think I will reach up and squash out your miserable life " , " and up he jumped , and up Diego Roberto jumped . Up on the scale went Dutch , and the weights all rattled on the stick . " Fly ! You are done for ! Whack ! " " Whack ! " went Diego Roberto . " But only one thing is wrong , " said Dutch . " I look down in my hand and I have no fly , and I think to myself how could I of missed it when I already seen the circuit once around and know I am the only club in the league . How could I of missed ? " He sat down in his chair again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still going B-z-z-z-z , B-z-z-z-z . " " B-z-z-z-z , B-z-z-z-z , " said Diego . " Forget it , " said Dutch . " I said forget it . " " Forget ? " said Diego . " What is forget ? " He whipped out his dictionary . " Mister , forget is not remember , but is too quick to not remember . She just now happen . " " Forget it means fuck it , " said Dutch . Roberto threw his dictionary away . " Do you know why I missed the fly ? Do you know why the fly is not dead ? Do you wish to know why it was 2  --  and 3 and 3  --  and could never be shook , and maybe as time went by come up from behind and stole the flag right off New York ? Do you wish to know ? Tell , me if you wish to know ? " " Yes sir , " said the boys . " Yes sir , Dutch . " " Sure , boss . " " Because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , which he should of never done because on pa/per he was no club a-tall but only a couple dozen men and boys dressed up in Washington suits . And if you wish to know why he flew through my fingers I will tell you that , too . The reason was because my fingers did not work together . The first finger says to the second finger , " I do not like you because you will not play cards with me , " and the third finger says to the fourth , " I do not like you from way back , " and the next finger goes back to the first and says , " You should hear what finger Number 2 been saying about you , " and the third finger says to the fourth , " Leave you and me cut finger Number 5 dead if we see him , and tell our goddam wife do the same , and bring up the kids likewise . " Boys , this is suicide . I seen it happen on other clubs , and I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine if I can squash it , and by God I will . As a starter there will be 2 things . There will be no more cards and no more borrowing nor lending . If anybody owes you money write it down on a piece of paper and we will see if we can clear it through the front office . And tonight will be the beginning of the new way of things . " " Time , Dutch , " said Egg , for Dutch forgets the clock when he gives you a lecture . " OK , " said Dutch , " leave us go play real ball , " and we all shot out , and when we got there it was raining , though we begun anyways , and Dutch did not like it and said , " Stall , " and the boys stalled , and Frank Porter come over to the dugout and said , " Dutch , tell your boys stop stalling . " " It is raining , " said Dutch . " Somebody will get hurt . " " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter . " I say it is not . " " Maybe not , " said Dutch , " but water is coming down out of the sky , and moonbeams are dripping off your nose , "  |p126and  the boys went on stalling all the same , and Porter kept coming over and complaining . " I have no control over my boys , " said Dutch . " Then you are no use on the bench , " said Porter . " Get out ! " " With pleasure , " said Dutch . " May you die in boiled oil , " and he went back in the clubhouse , the first time he been give the thumb all year , though not the last , and Joe took over and said , " Stall , " and the boys stalled some more , and soon the rain come down hard , and Porter called it off . And then not 3o minutes after the lecture , not 30 minutes , Perry and Keith and Jonah and Wash Washburn started singing " K-K-K-Katie , B-B-B-Beautiful Katie " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to it . " They are ragging us , Arthur , " said Bruce . " Yes , " I said . " You know , " he said , " they are ragging me more than they are ragging you any more . " " You bastards , " I shouted . " Did it all go in one ear and out the other ? " They pretended they did not hear me . " Honey lamb , " sung Perry , " tell me if I am the first . " And Keith sung out in this high , girly voice , " No , mysweetie pie , but there been only 4,000 before you . " " Sweet husband pie , " sung Wash Washburn , " that willbe $2o . " " B-B-B-But I am your husband , " sung Perry . " It makes no difference , " sung Wash , and Jonah laughed . The whole place shook when Jonah laughed , and you would of laughed yourself to hear him , laughing andp127hanging on the shower sprays to keep from falling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , too weak to rise , and Dutch heard them , and he come out of his office and said , " Turn off the water , " and they done so . " That will be $100 , boys , to the 4 of you , " and they quieted down fast then and begun figuring out if he meant 100 each or only 25 . I never did know what he meant myself , and I never did know what they paid . In the end Dutch probably kicked it all back anyhow.  |p128ARTHUR  , " said Bruce to me , " how do I change my beneficiary ? " " Who do you wish to change it to ? " said I. " To Katie , " said he . " She is going to marry me at last . " " When ? " said I. " When you change your beneficiary ? " " Arthur , " said he , " you got no right to tell me who Ican and who I can not change my beneficiary to . " " Why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or theyear before ? " " She never loved me before . " " Before what ? " said I. " Before now , " he said . " How is now different ? " said I. " Will you change it for me , " said he , " or not ? " " I will write away to Arcturus , " I said . " When ? " " Tuesday . " " Why not now ? " said he . " Because it is time to go to the park , " I said . " You have time , " he said . " I seen you dash off many a letter in the cab or standing against the wall . " " This is a matter of $50,000 , " said I. " Such a largep129figure must be handled sitting down with plenty of time to wet your pencil . " " Very well , " said he , " but do not forget and do it Tues-day . " Holly hit town that night , her belly button all punched out and boo Dollars kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said I. " This is nothing , " she said . " You should feel him when he is swinging 3 bats before taking his swipes . " " He will be no hitter , " said I. " Sid sure been hitting , " said she . " He is neck and neck with Babe Ruth , " said I. " But something is wrong , " said she , " for you should of long since shook Washington . " It was good having her there . It was good talking to somebody that knew the truth , for it was heavy carrying it around alone . We shoved the beds together , her in Bruce 's bed , though the linen new . Bruce was up at Katie 's all night . " I think Katie knows , " I said , and I asked her did I have the right to swindle him out of a change of beneficiary , and she said I did , and she laid for a long time tapping her teeth with her finger like she does , and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BeneficiaryDepartment of the Arcturus Company . " " That is a pretty damn smart idea , " said I , " even if I do say so myself . " " I am thinking for 2 , " she said . " I personally been doing the same for some months now , " I said . " It is keeping me hopping . It is a strain . " " Where do you stow your official Arcturus paper ? " she said.  | " In the flat desk in the little bedroom , " I said . " It is no longer there , " she said . " There is a crib there now . " " Where is the flat desk ? " I said . " In the play-room , " said she . " Whatwhat ? " I said . " In the what ? " " In the play-room , which was formerly your ex-workroom , " she said . " Where is my work-room ? " said I. " In the kitchen , " she said . " Why not the living-room by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the baby 's room , " she said . " You are libel to keep him awake swearing . " " I never swear , " said I. " Or if I do I must of picked it up somewheres . " We seen the first game of the doubleheader Memorial Day from the Moorses box on the third-base side . There was a couple automobile people in it plus the Prince of Persia . I rather sit on the first-base side myself except I wished to watch Murtha work , a right-hander , the same boy Bruce stole off and told the boys how , which we would of done Memorial Day again except we hardly got anybody on base . Down the right-field line , just shaded fair from the flagpole , the fans went mad when Sid come up , standing and hollering , " Here ! Here ! " upper and lower decks both and holding up these big signs with the number " i6 " painted red , meaning Sid should swat Number i6 in there . They probably had " 17 " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Sid swatted nothing off Murtha , and nobody else did neither . The power was off . We had a little rally going in the fourth , but Jonah popped out . We started moving againp131in the seventh , and Dutch yanked him altogether and sent Ugly up to hit , and Ugly drove in a run , the first and only run we scored off Murtha , and Bruce took over for Jonah . It was 2  --  1 at the time . I said " Goodby " to Holly , and she said " Good luck , " and I went down and got dressed . It was 5-1 a minute later , for Kussuth homered off Van Gundy , the best hitter Boston ever owned since Casey Sharpe . He give me more trouble all year than all the rest of Boston lumped together . Dutch yanked Van Gundy . I no sooner hit the clubhouse than he walked in , Van Gundy did , and I said , " What did he hit off you ? " and he said , " I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not get the son of a bitch out . I think I rather face Golman , " and he tossed his glove down and kicked it across the floor , a drop-kick , like in football . Mick picked it up and dusted it off . Poor Mick ! He must greet you alone in your worst minutes . I got dressed and went out . The board showed Washingtonsmearing Brooklyn all over the place , which cut our lead to 1  --  , the lowest it been all year . Bruce picked up a hit in the ninth , a hard single pumped down the line in left , and that made me feel better , though not much , and as soon as it was over I begun warming with Goose . And that was really the big switch , when everything changed or at least begun changing . I naturally had no idea . I walked over towards the warmuprubber with Goose , not talking , for we never talk , me and him . There was never anything to say . He had a coupleballs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a little ride with the inside of his elbow , popping it back in the same hand again , a man I played ball 4 yearsp132with , rode trains with , and showered with , but never liked , nor him me , and I said , " I wonder what it is a good idea trying throwing that Kussuth , " but I never got an answer , for the loudspeaker said , " Ladies and gentlemen , the nationalanthem of Persia , " and we stood still a minute while they played it through , and the Prince of Persia took a bow , and Goose seen Holly in the box and said , " How is your wife , Author ? " which for a minute never registered because he never asked me such a thing before , never cared about me , would not of thought much about it one way or the other if I dropped dead . " You know , " he said , " I ai n't took my wife out to the ball game in 11 years . " " Take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually first laid eyes on her in a ball park , " he said . He was looking at me . I could see his eyes . They were halfway between brown and gold . His beard was 3 days old , and his breath stunk from these mints he ate to stink out the liquor he drunk . Sweat was hanging off the hair of his chin . He never even bothered wiping it off any more . It sparkled in the sun . " I probably looked like you , " he said . " I shaved my face every day , and every new Kussuth that come along I went around asking everybody what to throw him . But there was Traphagen and all , and finally the only person that loved me I bashed her in the eye now and then to keep up my spirit . Yet I love her . Or at least I better start loving her again because I am all washed up and broke and will wind up in skid row without help . " " It is never too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , it is much too late . I am too old . " " With 7 or 8,000 in Series money , " said I , " I can fix you up with a plan as a starter . 7 or 8,000 will take up a lot of back slack . "  | " I was thinking of asking you , " he said , " only a fellow hates to ask a punk of 23 for tips on things . " " What do you own ? " I said . " Own ? You know what I own ? I own a couple catcher 's mitts and a baseball signed by each and every member of the 1944 Mammoths and a medal pinned on me by GeneralDouglas McCarthy . Put them all together and you can get $5 in any hockshop in Chicago . What I own is debts . " " We will declare bankruptcy , " I said . " How ? " he said . " I will show you , " I said . " But you must do me one favor . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to have a little fun , " he said . " He is dying , " I said . The balls dropped out of his hand and he bent down and picked them up and then dropped them again and left them roll . " You mean dying ? You mean where he is libel to blank out for good and ever ? You mean soon ? You mean any day ? " " They give him 6 months to 15 years , " I said . " Does Dutch know ? " " No , " said I. " You must not tell him . You must not tell anybody , for Dutch would cut him loose in a minute . " " I can not believe it , " he said . " Only me and you know , " I said . " Only us will ever know , " he said , and we shook hands , which must of looked peculiar out there , 2 fellows shaking hands . " We better start warming , " he said . I was blinding fast all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wobbly . " You fool ! " said I to myself . " You fool , with your foot in your mouth for a change . " Ip134was sure I done wrong , and I wished I could take it back . I felt like going down the line and telling Goose it was only a gag . But it passed , and I become lost , thinking only of the hitter . Goose was steady . The first couple innings I kept getting behind my hitter , and he kept pulling me out . He sung a little , singing , " No bopay ho , no bopay ho , " meaning " No ballplayer here , no ballplayer here , " until his wind give out along around the seventh . I could see how he was once a top-flight catcher , for he handles you nice , second fiddle all his life to Red Traphagen , but top-flight all the same , doing most of your worrying for you . He kept flashing 2 signs , and I flashed back the one I liked best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave her fly , leave her fly , " playing mostly by memory now , no legs , no arm , but steady , and I give up only one hit in 8 innings . It was o  --  o in the top of the ninth when a pinch-hitter name of Macklin slapped a single off me and was sacrificed along by Aleck Olson . Macklin was the first runner that reached second off me all afternoon . I was getting set to face Kussuth with 2 down and Macklin still on second when Dutch signed for the pick-off . What it is is the pitcher and the second baseman go into a count , counting " One cigarette , 2 cigarette , 3 cigarette , 4 cigarette , 5 cigarette , " and after cigarette 5 the second baseman cuts for second and the pitcher whirls and throws . You must count exactly the same speed , the 2 of you , you and the second baseman . Many a time Dutch will say in the clubhouse , " Count by cigarette , " and the pitchers and Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their head , " One cigarette , 2 cigarette , 3 cigarette , 4 cigarette , 5 cigarette , " and then all whirl and throw while Perry andp135Tyler and Wash all cut , all winding up their count on the same exact breath , and I signed , " OK , I got it , " adjusting my cap with the glove hand , and Perry signed that he also had it , singing " This hitter is much of a phonus bolonus . This hitter is much of a phonus bolonus , " Coker signing , Canada leaning in , ready to break and back in case the throw went wild , and on the second " bolonus " we begun counting , Coker drifting off towards third , Perry off down towards first , making Macklin feel comfortable with a big lead , me toeing in and counting , Perry counting , " One cigarette , 2 cigarette , 3 cigarette , 4 cigarette , 5 cigarette , " and then I whirled and threw , and Perry broke and dove across the bag and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not make it , and dug , backing and turning and heading for third , Perry up off his belly and running him down the line a little and firing to George , Macklin spinning again and George starting down the line after him , me backing George , and George fired to Coker , and Coker to me , Macklin reversing and reversing and reversing again , back and forth , me firing to Perry then , and Perry shouting " I got him , " and starting after Macklin and catching him halfway and putting the tag on the son of a bitch . Sid led off our ninth , and it looked like extra innings . There was a new Boston pitcher name of Debelak , and he took his final throws and said he was ready , and Sid stepped in and fixed his feet and wiped his hands and set his cap and finally looked down at the plate and told the ump dust it off . The fans were not shouting " Here ! Here ! " any more , and not waving Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ballplayer must never be bushed playing ball all year but a fan is in title to be bushedp136sitting on their ass keeping score . It is a cockeyed world . He stepped back in and got set all over again , his feet , his hands , his cap . Then he stepped out again and took a fresh chew of gum from his pocket and unwrapped it and stuck it in his mouth and put the old piece in the wrapper and wrapped it up and told the batboy come get it . Sid ca n't stand pieces of paper on the ground . Then he stepped back in again and fixed his feet and wiped his hands and set his cap , and Debelak threw , and Sid swung , and it rode on a line , like on a string , clearing the wall in right and probably punched a hole in somebody 's Number i6 . That was Number 7 for me . I lost only 3 by then . I led both leagues in E. R. A. and was about tied with Rob McKenna in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My weight was down to 205  --  . I was still working every fourth day and feeling awful good . Katie took us to dinner that night at a place called The Green Cow , $8 a plate , food extra . She looked at Holly 's belly and said , " I trust it ai n't catching , " and the managementtried to throw me out because I had no tie . Katie said , " Throw him out and you throw out me and all my trade with me , " and the management said " Begging your pardon " in French . Bruce said he doubted that there was any such a thing as a green cow , and Katie said , " There must not be if my little old future husband says so . " She called him her little old future husband about every 15 minutes , and they held hands when they walked . I would of puked if it been any less expensive . She dropped $56 down The Green Cow plus tips , and we went up to her place afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street in 2 years.  |p137They  all drunk a lot of wine except me . The telephone kept ringing , and I sat by it , answering it , saying , " Police Commissioner " and " Vice Squad " and " Dragnet ! My name is Friday . My partner is Joe Smith . Dum da dum dum . Dum da dum dum " until after awhile it stopped . I could see that she knew . But she was never sure if I knew she knew , and I give her nothing to go on , always saying to myself , pitching or anywheres else , " Half the fight is knowing , and the other half is not telling . " She also played it close . There was 50,000 in a bundle , and she was hot after it . She was extremely gorgeous , that night or any other . She drives you mad yet never gives you any kind of a come-on , never waggles her parts around like a girl in business might do , never speaks of bed but makes you think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she touches you without ever touching you . Holly and Bruce got silly with the wine and wound up talking crosswise across Katie , foolish talk , talking about me mostly , each of them going the other one one better every time , telling things about me too wonderful for me to believe , and I talked across them at Katie , not wishing to talk but listen and maybe get a line on her , but then doing most of the talking myself , like I was the one with the wine in my hand . I was hunting like mad for something to trade with in case the time come to talk trade , but I never knew much about her , then nor ever , where she come from nor why nor how long . Me and Holly left around midnight . She kissed Bruce at the door , or tried to , but he drawed back , and Katie looked at us and smiled and said , " After all , what would a man 's little old future wife think ? " and they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either had the attack or else only thought he did . I never stopped to worry which it was but flew out of bed and started waking up doctors . " Get back in bed and keep warm , " said I , and finally a doctor answered , a fellow name of Charleston P. Chambers , M. D. , and I give him our room and told him get over in a hurry . " Wait now , " said he . " Just what is the trouble ? " and I told him , and he told me tell him get back in bed and keep warm , which I already knew from the sheet the doctorsgive me in Minnesota , and the doctor yawned a coupletimes and said he would be right over as soon as he was shaved and dressed and located his chauffeur , and he begun telling me he had this loony chauffeur that had a wife in 2 different places , one on the east side and one on the west , and he was never sure which wife he might be at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will have a fellowmeet you in a cab , " and I wrapped a towel around me and flew down the hall and pounded on Goose 's door , and Horse opened it and said , " Come on in , Author , " and Ip139shoved past him and shook Goose awake and said , " I need help . " " What for ? " he said . " You know , " said I. " Oh , " he said , and he was out of bed and in his pants in 15 seconds . " What do I do ? " he said . " You can talk . Horse knows , for I told him . " " I thought you promised you would never tell a soul in the world , " I said . " Only my roomie , " he said . I give him the doctor 's address and went back to Bruce . He looked OK , only breathing a little hard was all , and cold , and I piled blankets on him and stuck a hot water bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just beginning to light up a little , the quiet time when all the air is clean and you can hear birds , even in the middle of New York City , the time of day you never see except by accident , and you always tell yourself , " I must get up and appreciate this time of day once in awhile , " and then you never do . Do n't ask me why . " I am sorry to of woke you , " he said . " Make it back to me some other time , " I said . " I do not think there will be another time , " he said . " Tomorrow is my birthday . I suppose my mother put a package in the mail . You can keep it when it comes , or cash it in if it is something you do not need . Give Katie a call . " " Lay still and save your energy , " I said . " I wish Katie was here , " he said . " Probably Dutch will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is something , ai n't it ? You know , I will bet I am the firstp140ballplayer ever died at the top of the Sunday averages . " He was 12 for 7 , 583 . " Tell Sid I hope he beats Babe Ruth . " " All these things you will take care of yourself , " said I , " if you will only lay still and save your energy . " " Is the doctor coming ? " " Yes , " said I. " Goose went after him . " " Why Goose ? " said he . " Why not ? " said I. " He was the first person I thought of . He has a heart of gold underneath . " " It just never really showed before , " he said . " People are pretty damn OK when they feel like it , " I said . " Probably you told him or something , " he said . " I never told a soul , " said I. " Probably everybody be nice to you if they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows everybody is dying , " I said . " That is why people are nice . You all die soon enough , so why not be nice to each other ? " " Hold on to me , " he said , and I took his shoulder and held it , and he reached up and took my hand , and I left him have it , though it felt crazy holding another man 's hand . Yet after awhile it did not feel too crazy any more . Soon the doctor walked in , all shaved and dressed , which really made me quite annoyed that he took so much time , and Goose and Horse with him . " Who is the sick ballplayer ? " he said . " You do not look sick . Open your mouth . " He whipped out a thermometer and stuck it in , and he took his pulse , looking up at Horse and saying , " Who are you ? " " Horse Byrd , " said Horse . " How did you ever get such a name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little large , " said Horse . " I would of never noticed , " said the doctor , and he read the thermometer and shook it down , and he read the " Instructionsfor the physician " and went back and examined Bruce some more and asked him questions , and when he was done he sat down on the other bed and thought awhile . " I think it is something else , " he said . " You mean something else besides what they said in Minnesota ? " I said . My heart jumped up . " I could not say about that , " he said . " I only mean I can see no danger as of this minute . " " It sure felt like it , " said Bruce . The doctor got up and walked back and forth , now and then stopping and looking at Bruce and asking one more question , then walking again . Finally he begun packing away his gear . " Boys , " said he , " pardon me for asking a stupid question . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He actually did , " I said . " Yet I keep seeing Babe Ruth down there in the corner of the page every morning , plus this other boy . " " Goldman , " I said . " Which club is Goldman with ? " " Ours , " I said . " Pardon me for asking one more stupid question , " he said . " No doubt I am no better than an Australian or somebody for not knowing a thing like this , but what club are you with ? " I told him . " Now you can do me one favor , " I said . " You can send the bill @ me in Perkinsville , New York , and also not leak anything to the paper . " " I am not in the habit of leaking my house calls to thep142paper , " he said . " Tell Goldman I hope he strikes out Babe Ruth . " I lost to Chicago that night , though they are usually the softest touch in the world for me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I did it was one of these hot , sweaty sleeps . Goose was tired , too . He been catching all week , Dutch benching Jonah and hoping Goose would power up the lower end of the order . He done so , too . We won 4 in a row between the game I won Memorial Day and the game I lost Friday night to Chicago which I would of never lost if I had any sleep under my belt . Dutch said he believed he would now rotate me every 5 days instead of every 4 , which he done , rotating Van Gundy every 6 instead of 5 , starting Lindon Burke and Blondie Biggs fairly regular now , and spot-pitching Piss against right-hand clubs if his hay fever was n't acting up too bad . Around this time of year you wake up one morningshort pitchers . In the beginning you look around you , and you say , " We are certainly loaded with pitching , " and then all of a sudden doubleheaders start piling up and people give out or get hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in May . We dropped back to the 1  --  cushion over Washington , though we picked it up again Saturday , a real slaughter , beating Chicago 13-3 , the most runs we scored all year so far . Sid hit 2 and was now 2 up on Babe Ruth , and Pasquale and Vincent and Canada and Goose hit one apiece . The paper now took some notice of Goose . He wrote an article called " How I Hit the Comeback Trail at 35 " whichp143a writer name of Hubert W. Nash wrote and sold and give him $250 for and the magazine said it would print when his birthday rolled around in August , but it never did . I mean the magazine never printed it . I took 200 of the 250 and applied it against premiums and with 40 more he bought his wife a dress , saving out io for taxes which I told him to or else have the United States Bureau of Internal Revenue kicking down his door all winter . I did not like him hanging with the writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he never said a word about it , and never would . Saturday night after dinner there come a knock on the door , and in walks Goose and Horse with a birthday cake and 4 quarts of ice cream . I said to myself , " Buddy , now you seen everything . " " Happy birthday , " they said , and they laid the cake on the dresser and tore open the ice cream . There were 2 candles on the cake , one for the years and one to grow on . " Many happy returns of the day to you , Bruce old pal , " they said , and we said , " Same to you , boys , " and we dug in . They also brung a carton of Days 0 Work , and Bruce said " Thanks " and picked out a chew and passed the box around , though nobody else took . " There looks like enough there to last you 15 or 20 years , " said Goose . " Do not lay it on too thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad to say they did not . They polished off the cake and cream and got up and took off . Goose busted up both ends of the doubleheader Sunday with 2 doubles in the first game and a single with the bases loaded in the second , pinch-hitting for Jonah , which give us 3 out of 4 over Chicago , 7 wins in the last 8 starts.  |p144Monday  morning Bruce said to me , " You forgot to write away to Arcturus , " and I snapped my finger and said , " So I did . As soon as I get back from drill I will . " It was an open day , but Dutch calls drills on open days if things are going good , believing in keeping in stride . He also calls them when things are going poorly , believing that a drill on an open day will break your stride . I guess he knows because it works , or else he just misses being away from the park . Whatever it was we drilled , and all the way up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce said to me , " Do not forget and write that letter , " and I told him I would if he ever stopped asking . I was standing around shagging flies when Roberto Diego come running out . " Mister , " he said , " Dutch is wishing you , " and in I went . " Author , " said Dutch , " meet Mr. Rogers . Mr. Rogers , meet Henry Wiggen . Author , Mr. Rogers is a detective . Close the door and sit down . Mr. Rogers been down to Bainbridge and is now on the way up to Rochester , Minnesota , filling in some facts for me . However , you can save him a trip and the club some cash by filling in the rest of the story which Mr. Rogers begun . " " I will certainly try my darnest , " I said . " Tell him what you told me , " said Dutch , and Mr. Rogers begun . " I went and hung in Bainbridge a week , " said he , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jotted down on little scraps of paper , and he kept looking at them . " I seen the following people , " he said . " On May 19 I seen Mr. Randy Bourne at the crate and box plant ,  |p145and  on May 20 I seen Mr. Dow McAmis at the Country Club , and on May 21 I seen a colored man name of Leandro . " " Never mind the facts , " said Dutch . " Get down to the details . " " Well , " said Rogers , " I was told that along about the end of October Mr. Pearson told these various people that he was not feeling so good and went to the hospital in Atlanta , and they told him why not try up in Rochester , Minnesota , and see what been ailing you . He drove up to Minnesota and returned in January with Mr. Wiggen , tellingeverybody he was cured of what he had . Him and Mr. Wiggen hung in Bainbridge a month and then drove off with a girl . " " My wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I developed the information that nobody knew what was ailing him , " said Rogers . He folded his papers and laid them on Dutch 's desk . " Do you get paid for doing this ? " I said . " Because you developed absolutely nothing that I could not of told you and saved you a hot trip down there this time of year , plus which you developed actually less than half the truth , which I will personally fill in now for Dutch and wind up the whole matter once and forever and get back out and drill where I ought to be keeping in stride . " " Do not stall , " said Dutch . " I actually developed a lot more than this but am only giving you the bare particulars , " said Rogers . " If you actually spoke to anybody worth the while , " said I , " you would of learned that Bruce has this rotten habit of running off to Atlanta maybe once or twice a month . No doubt you developed this much . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did , " said Rogers , " but I did not think it worth mentioning . " " Because as a detective you are from hunger , " said I. " No need telling you where he went in Atlanta . Everybodyknows . And you know what you sometimes pick up in them places , which he did and which he rather not have them treat in Atlanta nor anywheres else near home for fear of it getting back and troubling his mother with her heart trouble . He was ashamed . You no doubt developed the information that when he went up to Minnesotahe took along his fishing and hunting gear though when he got there found all the rivers 9 feet deep in ice . He checked in , got himself shot with a few miracle drugs , flirted with the nurses , checked out , met me in Cannon Falls , went hunting , changed his mind , and back down home again . " " Goddam it , " said Dutch , and he flung open his door . " Diego Roberto ! Run out and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and called Doc Loftus . " Come up here , " he said , and the 2 of them wandered in about the same time . " Take down your pants , " said Dutch . " Are you over the clap yet ? " " Yes sir , " said Bruce . " Long ago . " " Check him over , " said Dutch . " All I need is the clap running through my ball club . " " Do not forget to write that letter , " said Bruce to me , standing there while Doc checked him over . " What did you do for it ? " said Doc . " Got shot with miracle drugs , " said Bruce . " He looks fine to me , " said Doc . He went over and washed his hands.  | " Should I head out and develop this information further in Rochester , Minnesota ? " said Rogers . " Stay with it , " said Dutch . " Some things have yet to be explained . " " While I am here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers . " If you charge more than $1.50 you are a swindler , " I said , and I went out whistling . That night I wrote the letter , saying , " Dear Sir , please send me a change of beneficiary form for my insured , Mr. Bruce William Pearson , Jr. , " and his policy number underneath , and I showed it to him and slid it in the envelope and told him I would mail it this instant before I forgot , and I done so , sending it up to Holly . Cleveland moved in , and we took 2 out of 3 and they moved out and St. Louis in , and we split 2 with them , Friday night washed out , and we went west 3 games to the good . I pitched the first afternoon in Chicago and was really my top , which was a good thing , too , because the power was off . It is usually always off in Chicago because the wind in from right plays hell with Sid and Pasquale and Vincent . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind with left-hand hitters . Sid only hit one home run in Chicago all year . The second day Dutch moved Pasquale back to Number 6 , moving Canada up to 3 and Coker to 5 and lifting Vincent altogether and playing Lawyer Longabucco in left , and then finally how we won it Bruce hit a home runp148in the eighth , batting for F. D. R. who relieved , the first home run Bruce hit since Friday , July 25 , 1952 , according to the paper , and the first home run he ever hit in the pinch , a high and gliding type of a drive that started out too much towards left-center but then got hung in the wind and washed over towards left , and in . Gil Willowbrookmopped up in the ninth . But Thursday you could n't of bought a breeze , and we sat around in the clubhouse going through the old routine where the first fellow says , " I wish I was dead , " and the second fellow says , " Why do you wish you were dead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to hell . " Somebody is supposed to ask , " But why should you wish to go to hell ? " I asked it myself one day in St. Louis my first year up , and I had to buy everybody a coke . " I wish I was dead , " said Gil . " Why do you wish you were dead ? " said Herb . " Because I will go to hell , " said Gil , and everybody waited , and now Wash Washburn said , " But why should you wish to go to hell ? " " Because hell will be cooler than Chicago , " said Gil , " and that will be cokes all around , " and Wash looked at Perry , and Perry said , " I guess it will , Wash , " and it was , and Dutch come out and give the lineup , Goose catching , and Goose said , " Dutch , I am hot and tired . " He was breathing , and he looked beat . " Very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Doc fork out some heat pills , and Doc brung them out and we passed them around and the boys swallowed them down with their coke , all except me and maybe 3 or 4 others . No doubt they are good pills , green for heat , white for weariness , blue and yellow for pain , dependingp149where the pain is , for many of the boys been taking them for many years , and they sometimes help , and others been taking them rather than hurt Doc 's feelings , but I believe they are all the same pill colored different . " Goose , " said Dutch , " why not hang in town over the weekend and meet us in Pittsburgh Monday ? " and Goose said he would . He took his wife and kids to the beach and was pretty much a new man by Monday . I believe Dutch might of regretted it , but he never said a word . We lost to Chicago on getaway day , and then we lost 2 straight in Cleveland , the first time all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now skinned back to 1  --  again , the power sometimes off and sometimes on and many people blaming Jonah , for even if it was on it was never on in the 8 spot , and Dutch benched Jonah and started Bruce , my day to work , warm but not hot , a perfect day for baseball and a great Sunday crowd . I was hooked up with Rob McKenna , a left-hander . I beat Rob in a i6-inning ball game one night in July of 52 , Chapter 28 in " The Southpaw " if you wish to read it again , one of the ball games of my life that I remember best , but he beat me after that more than I ever beat him , or anyhow beat the club , not me . We simply never hit him . He has an overhand fast ball that fogs through with a kind of a downspin , almost a sinker , and even if you hit it you hit it in the dirt . He fogged it through that afternoonlike always , and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was working good and hate to see hard work end up in the lost column . Bruce said , " He sure burns them through . " " Damn it , " I said . " Do not sit there admiring him . Think how to hit the son of a bitch . "  | " I am thinking , " he said , and I believe he must of been . He had his chew up between his front teeth , where he keeps it when he is thinking , not chewing but only thinking , for he can not do both . " I been thinking I can never hit his fast ball but can whale his curve a mile . " " I rather see you whale it than talk about it , " said I. " I could whale it , " said Bruce , " if I knew when it was coming , or else I am meeting it late . " " Then study him , " said I , " and figure out when it will be coming . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does it say ? " said I. " It says he will throw me a curve after 2 strikes and try and clip the corner , and if he misses he will throw me still another a little closer in . " But Bruce went on hitting in the dirt all afternoon , and the boys as well , all but Sid . Sid parked Number 20 in the stands in the fourth . He was now 2 behind Babe Ruth , and we went into the eighth trailing 2-1 , Canada opening it with a single , Vincent Carucci trying to push him along but bunting foul twice and finally fanning , and Coker topping a fast ball and sending a slow roller towards short which if it been any faster would of been 2 for sure , but was slow , Coker beating the relay to first , and Dutch said , " Lawyer , if Pearson gets on you hit for Author . " Bruce took the 2 strikes , and he leaned in and waited for the curve , and it come , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a ball , Cleveland beefinghard , and the crowd as well , and I remember Dutch crying above the sound , " Good eye , Pearson , " Bruce leaning on his bat and waiting for Cleveland to calm , and then stepping back in , his jaw working and saying , " Robp151McKenna is only a country boy like me , or else a country boy from the city , " Rob looking down at Coker on first , then looking in , and kicking and pitching , Bruce counting on the curve , set for it , swinging , and when he hit it you knew it was hit and never looked for it , Coker tearing for second full speed and then slowing and jogging on around and waiting at the plate for Bruce , and shaking his hand . Longabucco sat down , and I took my swipes , looking for the 2 strikes first , and then the curve , and swinging on the curve , but fanning . The damn trouble is that knowing what is coming is only half the trick . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-2 . Goose caught the rest of the way through the west , and things held up . We played 3 at night in Pittsburgh , and 2 out of 3 at night in St. Louis , and it was cooler . I knew Goose would not last the year , and I am positive Dutch did , too , but Dutch was now past worrying about the year . He was nursing things along day by day , now 2 , now 212 , pretty much stuck with what he had . There was no use hoping for miracles . Catchers do not drop out of the sky . You have the people you have , and you know what you are up against , and all you can hope is your people will pull together , and if they do you will also get a little help from wind and weather and Mother Luck and the schedule and the umps and charity bounces . Goose brung his boy back to Pittsburgh with him , halfwaythrough High School with pimples all over his face name of Andy , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doc give him pills for the pimples , and he stood with us until around July 4 , a nice kid , but tough , always trying to talk out of the side of his mouth and swearingp152like go when Goose was n't around . He drilled with us , all style but no results until Jonah told him one day , " Boy , catch the ball first and pose for your photo later . " Goose left him strictly alone on the ball field . St. Louis beat me 3-o . How can you win without runs ? I had an 1 1  --  5 record when we started home from St. Louis Sunday night , but I actually never give it much of a thought nor stopped to think how close I was to the bonus clause . I know that nobody will ever believe me , so why I even bother to write it down is beyond me , but it is true . When your roomie is libel to die any day on you you do not think about bonus clauses , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your mind is on now if you know what I mean . You might tell yourselfi oo times a day , " Everybody dies sooner or later , " and that might be true , too , which in fact it is now that I wrote it , but when it is happening sooner instead of later you keep worrying about what you say now , and how you act now . There is no time to say , " Well , I been a heel all week but I will be better to him beginning Monday " becauseMonday might never come.  |p153WE  GOT home from St. Louis very late Monday night . There was some kind of a wreck on the railroad , and Dutch yanked Van Gundy and Biggs off the train in Indianapolis and sent them home by air for the full night sleep . When we finally got there there was a letter from Holly , or I suppose you might say from the new Change of Beneficiary Department of the Arcturus Company sayingthe man in charge went out of town and would n't be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon . Every g or 4 days Bruce said , " That fellow must be back from Oregon by now , " and I wrote another letter , and the reply come back saying he went from Oregon to Colorado , and things went on like that for quite a number of weeks . There was also a message in my box from Tootsie saying Katie called twice a day and she was getting tired hearing her voice , Tootsie was , and a note from a fellow name of Burton McC . du Croix offering The Mammoth Quartet a spot on a TV show the following Wednesday night , ioo apiece less his own io% . I went up to Coker and Canada 's , for I could of used $90 about then , and they said , " Sure , tell Perry , " and I said , " Youp154tell Perry because I am frankly not on very good speaking terms with him any more . " " Neither am I , " said Coker . " Why not ? " said I. " It is nobody 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada must tell him , " I said . " Not me , " said he . " We will match coins , " said I. " Go ahead and match them , " said Canada , and I done so , and he lost , but he refused all the same , saying Perry give him a pain in the ass and he stopped speaking to him , coins or not . " It is all very sad , " said I. " The 4 of us used to be as thick as flies not many years back . I remember the good old days on the Cowboys . The whole club gives me the creeps . I am libel to wake up some morning not speaking to myself . " " Everybody is nervous , " said Coker . " Why not cut Perry out and call it The Mammoth Trio ? " said Canada . " That is a good idea , " I said , " but I got a better one yet . Why not cut Perry out and Bruce in ? " " He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us following the music is plenty , " I said . But we got nowheres , and they said , " Leave us sleep on it , " and I left and went down to Perry 's myself and knocked on the door , and Jonah opened it an inch and peeked around and said , " Oh , hello , Author , " and he left me in quick and shut the door . They were playing cards , the 4 of them , which Dutch said not to , and they said , " Pull up a chair , Author , " fairly friendly , all but Perry , and I played a couplehands though my mind was not on it .   " Well , " said Perry , " when is the big wedding ? " They all laughed . " Pretty soon , " said I. " No doubt he will invite us , " said Perry . I said he would . " I just bet he will , " said Perry , and they all laughed again . " If you boys would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not such a bad fellow , " said I. " In fact you would do me a great favor not ragging him . " " He deserves it , " said Keith . " Why ? " said I.He only shucked his shoulders and looked at Perry . They are good boys , never purposely nasty except they get kicked around a good deal where a white fellow might not . I knew that if they knew what I already knew and carried it around until everybody I met I felt like spilling it they would of buddied up to Bruce , or if not buddied up at least laid off , good ballplayers all of them , though Keith can not go the distance and will not learn from his betters , very effective for 3 innings at the most and then blows . Yet I did not spill it . Telling Goose was already too much . I kept expecting him or Horse to give it away any day , and I only said , " Why rag him about the wedding ? It makes him feel good thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It keeps up our spirit ragging him , " said Wash . " What is wrong with your spirit ? " said I. " You are a young fellow . What do you need your spirit kept up for so early in life ? " " Never mind the lecture , Author , " said Perry . " I will leave , " said I. " Nobody said leave , " said Jonah.  | " Leave him leave , " said Perry . " He probably rather hang with his own anyway . " " With my own what ? " said I. " I never expected I would hear such a remark from you . " " With Pearson , " he said , " and Horse and Goose , the lowest type scum of the earth . " " You are wrong , " said I. " Pearson has not got a nasty bone in his body , which if you ever give him a chance he would show you . " " He shown me plenty already . I seen going on 4 years of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearson would not give me the time of day if I was dying . " " He does not know it himself half the time , " I said . " When he cuts you dead it is only because he got nothing to say , not because he does not like you . I hung down home with him over the winter , and more than once I seen him give a big hello to folks along the main drag , colored folks as well as white , the same big hello . " " And they probably said pardon me for living , Mr. Pearson , please allow me to kiss your wonderful white ass . Do not tell me what Georgia is like , Author , for I been there once too often and seen for myself . " " Can he help being from Georgia ? " said I. " You was born there yourself . " " And I had the brains to pick up and leave , " said he . " Must he pick up and leave ? " I said . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die there when he dies . " " I hope he gets his wish , " said Perry . " Somebody deal . " " Probably the sooner the better , " said Wash . " You are a fresh punk , " said I. " What do you know about anything ? "  | " Anything I love is a nice friendly game of cards , " said Jonah . " Deal me out , " said I. " I can not stand fresh punks talking about something they know nothing about . Do you think you are going to live forever ? Is life so long you rather rag somebody than be nice to them ? " " Listen to me now , " said Perry . " I said play cards or go somewheres else and preach . Nobody invited you in , so as long as you are here join in the fun or else disap-pear . " " I will disappear , " I said , and I went back and called Croix , saying what everybody said was we needed new blood in The Mammoth Quartet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Who in hell is Pearson ? " he said . " No , I would not drop Simpson if I was you . He is half the laugh . How about Goldman ? " " No , " said I , " how about me and Pearson and Goose Williams and Horse Byrd ? Byrd weighs 240 pounds and would be good for quite a laugh . " " Leave me sleep on it , " he said , " and call you back in the morning , " and then he never called me but called Perry instead , and Wednesday night The Mammoth Quartet all of a sudden found their name changed to The Four Brown Mammoths , Perry and Jonah and Wash and Keith . They sung " Davy Crockett " and " Come Josephine In My Flying Machine , " and they stunk . If Washington was n't always such a soft touch for the Mammoths they would of swept past us right there in that little stretch of 2 weeks between the time we got homep158from the west and the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something awful up and down the east , slimming our cushion down to one game by the Fourth of July , which was my 24th birthday , 25% of the way along for me , for I believe I can live to 96 if I keep in shape and do n't come down with a fatal disease and if the son of a bitches do n't blow up the place with their cockeyed bomb . But we blew it back up to 3 on the Fourth , whipping them twice down there before a record crowd that grew quieter and quieter as the afternoon wore on and finally filed out the park without a peep . Sid took fire once we hit home , and we played steady ball all week except we lost ground , Washington taking 4 straight from Brooklyn and 2 out of 3 from Boston . Sid hit Number 24 and 5 off Boston Thursday and 26 and 7 off Richie Erno Friday night , which gives you some idea how hot he was . It was the first time he hit 2 home runs in one ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday , April 24 , 1953 , according to the paper . He was even-up with Babe Ruth , which brung out a record crowd Saturday , Ladies Day , the whole park screaming their head off when he so much as spit . The only thing nobody noticed was we did not win on Friday , but lost , which chipped the lead to 112 . Beating paper records is fine and nice , but the game goes down in historyas lost unless you keep the other fellow from scoring more runs , and the boys all said the same , and Sid as well , saying he rather break both legs and cop the flag than beat Babe Ruth and wind up second , and I believed him when he said it , for he is a friend of mine , though many of the boys did not . They never said anything top159Sid himself , but they made these dirty remarks concerningBabe Ruth , saying they were tired hearing about him and tired seeing his name in the paper and tired following his record of 28 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we did not start putting pitching and hittingtogether . " So what if Sid beats Babe Ruth ? " said some of the boys . " Does it pay my bills ? I will not be up here forever and must make cash while the sun shines . " " Right , " said some of the boys . " Right , " said I. " Then why not pull together like a club ? What is the sense blaming anything on Sid ? He is doing exactly what he is supposed to be getting paid for . Why not everybody cut out the horseshit ? " " Author is right , " they said , and for a couple minutes they all stood around saying , " Yes sir , Author is right , " " Yes sir , Author hit it on the head , " and then they no sooner said this than they started deciding just who was to blame in the first place and who was more horseshit than the next fellow until you were back where you begun . Saturday we lost . Sid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning , and the crowd went mad , 5 home runs in 3 days , probably some sort of a record exceptI did not even look at the Sunday paper , and we jumped to a 3  --  0 lead but could not hold it . The power went off , dead , and we dropped it , 4  --  3 . Goose tired , and Bruce caught the last 4 innings and cracked 2 doubles in 2 times at bat , the first time he hit for extra bases in 2 consecutive trips to the plate since September of 49 , and we all dragged ourself back in the clubhouse with 2 new records racked up but one more game lost . We sat around listening to the last couple innings of Washington vs . Boston , which Boston finally won , and when it was over Lin/don got up and switched it off , and Ugly said , " Lindon , you set a record switching off the radio . " Lindon looked at the radio . " I done what ? " he said . " You set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday you probably only switched the radio off 15,738 times . Now you switched it off 15,739 . " " Officially or unofficially ? " said I. " Every day you live you live one more day , " said LawyerLongabucco . " You beat your own record . " " Officially or unofficially ? " said Blondie Biggs . " I talked 3,112 official words today , " said Jonah . " That puts me 3,112 official words up on yesterday . " " Today is the first time I ever officially hung this jock on this particular nail at 4:02 P.M. in the afternoon of July 9 , 1955 , " said Perry . " Today is the first day we ever lost to Brooklyn by a score of 4  --  3 after leading 3  --  o in the first inning on Ladies Day I bet , " said Harry Glee . " Are the ladies official ? " said Ugly . " Some are and some ai n't , " said Harry . " Today was the first time in my official and unofficial life I ever fouled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  2 on me against a right-hand pitcher name of Fairbright , " said Canada . But nobody laughed . All the time we dressed we kept shouting out new records , how many times we now officiallybuckled our belt and tied our tie and laced our shoe or shaved or combed our hair , how many official miles the zip on your fly now went , how many times you zipped it with your left hand and how many times with your right , how many official times you looked in the mirror , how many official times you breathed , how many tons of waterP161you showered in and how many times you stood at the clubhouse door and looked back and wondered what you officially forgot , shouting out your record but still not laughing , nobody feeling too much like laughing right about then . Blondie Biggs started for us Sunday , a blond-hair bonus boy straight out of college with a side-arm delivery that the boys all say they rather see in a Mammoth shirt than on somebody else , though what they never told him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He improves as time goes on , but he still had a lot to learn that Sunday which Dutch probably figured could wait until some other time except when we were only 1  --  games on top . July is no time to start learning , and he got jittery , Dutch did , and he said , " Author , go warm , " and I went down to the bullpen with Diego . " Mister , " said Diego , " you only rest her up 3 days . " " You warm me and leave Dutch run the club , " said I , and after I warmed awhile the crowd begun to boo . I looked around , but I could not tell what they were booing at . It was quite crazy . I telephoned back to the dugout and asked what was up , and nobody knew , and I kept on warming , and the crowd kept on booing . There was this one cluck hanging over the fence , and I said , " What you booing at ? " and he threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was going to paste him , though 1 was not . Finally he come out from behind his hands , still screaming , " Boo-oo-oo-oo , boo-oo-oo-oo , you bum , you phony , boo-oo-oo-oo , " his face all red . He was a little bald up front , and the top of his head was also red , and he wasp162mad and shaking his fist , and I said again , " Cluck ! You ! Cluck there ! What you booing at ? " He was quite hoarse . He could hardly speak . " Ai n't everybody ? " he said . " But why ? " said I. " I do not know , " said he . " Boo-oo-oo-oo , bum , boo-oooo-oo , " and the telephone rung , Ugly , and he said , " What did the cluck say ? " and I said all he said was " Boo " but did not seem to know why , and I went on warming . Horse and Bruce come down after awhile , and Horse warmed , and the booing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Sid come up , and silence when he did not hit a home run , and then they actually booed Sid himself in the seventh when he reached across the plate and dumped a single in left instead of waiting for the kind of a pitch he could homer on , the first and last time in my life I ever heard a local crowd boo a local ballplayerfor collecting a base hit . It was 2  --  2 in the top of the eighth when Blondie got himself in the kind of hot water he was not libel to pitch himself out of , and I went in and faced a left-hand hitter name of Stan Andersen that Brooklyn then lifted and sent up Hal Wilder instead , a right-hander , an old-timer that been on the roster of 6 or 7 clubs including the Mammoths of 42 , a grandfather , I think the only grandfather on the active list , and Dutch come out to the hill and said he wondered if Horse might do better than me against Wilder . He stood thinking about it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said I. " Search me , " said Dutch . " The press-box says they are booing me for working you before the All-Star Game . I can not say that I am the slightest bit interested . "  | " They are simply out of their mind as usual , " said Perry . " Lay halfway deep on this son of a bitch , " said Dutch . " He is fast for an old man , but not too deep . " The boys went back to their spots , and Jonah sung , singing , " Wing her through , Author , wing her through , " and I threw only one pitch that inning , my best pitch , a halfspeedcurve that hooks away from a right-hand hitter and also sinks and slides , which some boys call my sinking screwball and others call a hooking slider , though I myself never bothered to give it a name . I threw it at his knees , and he went for it , thinking it was only straight but then seeing it hook . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he beat it down in the dirt towards second , and Perry come up with it and flipped to Coker , and Coker to Sid , and it was now my ball game to win or lose , which we did in the bottom of the ninth , Number 14 for me . I still did not know what they were booing at , and the paper did not know , neither , some saying one thing and some another , but I now know it was none of the things they said . It was only a lot of disgusted people wondering how a club consisting of what the Mammoths consisted of in the way of power and brains on paper only managed to be games in front of the pack with time half run out . It was the same as saying , " Everything is at your fingertips . Yet you are libel to blow as high as the sky any day . Can you not get a move on ? " I believe that for once in their life the clucks were right , and Holly says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and George and Pasqualeand Van Gundy left Monday for Milwaukee , 7 of us , more Mammoths than from any club in the league , which gives you some idea the kind of a club it was , richp164with stars , and 3 of us were in the starting lineup Tuesday , me and Sid and Pasquale , and in the end it was George saved the ball game with a running catch over his shoulder in short left . He catches many like that , one a week , but Milwaukee never set eyes on him before , and it was all anybody talked about all night . I got credit for the win , my first All-Star win , the first All-Star Game I played in since 52 , though I was on the squad in 53 . Back in the hotel Pop called and said , " Hank , I took Holly to the hospital . " " Is he born yet ? " I said . " Not yet , " he said . " Is something up ? " said I. " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was . " You looked good . Ai n't you ever going to take the rest of your weight off ? " " Trade your set in on a smaller screen , " said I. " I will look smaller then , " and he got a great laugh out of that . " I kind of looked for Sid to hit one today , " he said . " It would of been a nice touch . How is Bruce ? " " The same , " said I. " He is supposed to call me . " " I sure think about him night and day , Hank . You know , if you will pardon me for saying it , he sure been handed one shit deal . " " You are swearing , " I said . You have got to make Pop awful mad to swear , and it give me a great charge inside . Here was somebody else besides myself carrying this mad around inside him . It really hit me , and I done a crazy thing . I got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I kicked the little telephone table there and sent it flying across the room , and the telephone come off the hook and the operator started screaming , " May I help you ?  |p165May  I help you ? " over and over again , and I yanked a drawer out of the dresser and heaved it at her , and I remember I stood there bawling and breathing and looking for something to throw and finally seen the shower curtain , and I grabbed it and pulled it off the bar and tore it in 2 and kicked the toilet and stood with a glass in my hand and aimed it very carefully and slung it across the room at a painting on the wall of a girl carrying flowers and smashed the glass and the frame together and felt much better , and the house detectives busted in and put the phone back on the hook . " Where is the person you beat up in here ? " they said . " Person ? " I said . " Person hell . There were 9 of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . " " Pay the damage in cash and no questions asked , " the detectives said , and they added it up and I paid it , and they give me a receipt . We will put it on the tax on the long run , medical expenses , because somewheres along the line you have got to blow your fume little by little or else blow it all in one blow later . I waited for Bruce to call , and he done so and was fine , and I went down and hung in the lobby . I seen a lot of old familiar faces , Sam Yale and Swanee Wilks and Hams Carroll from the 52 Mammoths . I thought Red might show , but he did not . He never does . Jocko Conrad took me around and introduced me to many old-time ballplayers , telling them , " Here is Henry Wiggen , my very own discovery , " which was about 2% true , but I said nothing . I used to correct people a lot when they lied , but I cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner and lied some more , and they sat around all evening drinkingand lying , telling me things I knew never quite hap/pened that way , and I said , " Yes , I remember reading about that , " or " Yes , I heard that game on the radio when I was a kid , " or " Yes , my old man told me about that many a time , " because why in hell snag old men on their lies ? Who cares anyhow ? Every year they die . You see an old fellow at the All-Star Game , or at the World Series , or in the South , or hanging at the winter meetings , and they lie to you , and the next thing you read in the paper where they are dead , old fellows not so many years before so slim and fast , with a quick eye and great power , and all of a sudden they are dead and you are glad you did not wreck their story for them with the straight facts . In the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The operator would not leave me charge the call , saying , " Young men that smash up their room are not in title to telephone long distance , " and I went down and paid cash and went back up and called , and the hospital said , " Nothing doing yet , " and I flew home . She was already born when I got there , laying on her belly in a little glass cart on wheels in Holly 's room , practicallybald , and I said to Holly , " How come no hair ? " for I always had the idea you were born with a lot of hair . " She is perfect in every way , " said Holly , " and exactly at her weight , which is more than I can say for everybody , " and we give her the name of Michele , for Mike Mulrooney , manager of the Queen City Cowboys . " Flip it over , " I said , " so I can have a look . " " You flip it over , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because she is a human person already . " I flipped her over , and then I picked her up and held her , Michele I mean , sitting on the bed with Holly , andp167the sun was first coming in the window like it was that morning when Bruce had the attack , or thought he did , and I was about ready to bawl again after just getting through bawling in Milwaukee , sitting there with this littlebit of a human person in my hand . " It was a good thing George made that catch , " she said . " I could not of waited a minute longer . Then when I got here she did not wish to pop . You were a good boy to come . How is Bruce ? " " The same , " said I. " He will be pleased . Not a day goes by but what he asks . " " Go grab some sleep , " she said . " I grabbed some on the plane , " I said . " I did not sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . " There is nothing to cry about , " I said . " Why cry ? " " I do not know , " she said . " Probably if I knew I could . I wonder if they made a mistake out there . It is hard to see how a fellow in such good shape as him could be in such bad shape . I am reading all the books on Hodgkin , and it is true . " " It is hard to believe they could make such a mistake , " I said . " They have got such a wonderful reputation on pa-per . " " Go see your father , " she said , and I stuck Michele back in the cart and kissed her and kissed Holly and went home in Neil Weiss 's cab . Neil told me tell Dutch why not bench Vincent Carucci and play McGonigle in left , and why not buy a good catcher or else develop one in a hurry , and I said I would . I called Pop . " Rise and shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round you up some breakfast , " and he come over and wep168ate , and he looked at me and said , " It gets more like lookingin the mirror every day . " " I doubt that I will ever run as heavy as you , " I said . " Do not put money on it , " he said . " That is a wonderful kid of yours , bright as she can be like her grandfather . " " Her hairline , too , " said I. " She also gets that from her grandfather , " and we laughed a good bit back and forth until Pop stopped laughing all of a sudden and said , " Write down Bruce 's old man 's address . I been writing him a letter in my head all summer and might put it down any day . You should of long since shook Washington in my opinion . " " In my opinion also , " said I. " Do the boys know ? " said he . " Only Goose and Horse , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Piney Woods never showed the stuff . All spring it looked like he might . Well , life is life I guess , burn up the world in the spring and back to AA by summer . " Pop talked and packed it away , both . I always love to watch him eat . It is almost as good as eating yourself . " I sure think a lot about the old man , " he said . " Goddam it , you raise up a kid from 7 pounds to 205 and then some doctor comes along and tells you he has got a fatal disease . Nobody is supposed to die that young in these modern times , but I can not think what to write . Every time I put something down it looks like somebody else wrote it . " " Say it out loud first , " I said , " and remember it and write it down , and then get up and walk around and say some more , and quick run and write that down , too . Write it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why ? " said he . " What have you got against apostro-phes ? "  | " Nothing , " said I. " They do it in the paper , so I do it . " " I guess you ought to know , " he said , " being an Author and all . " I went to bed but I could not sleep . I started writing in my head , the first time I done any since " The Southpaw " over the winter between 52 and 53 , and I could not sleep but got up and fished out the paper and started writing from the beginning , where the telephone call come , " Me and Holly were laying around in bed around to A.M. on a Blank morning , " not remembering what morning because over the winter one day is about like the next . The summer you can follow in the paper . I hunted up the old telephone bills and saw when the collect call come from Rochester , Minnesota , and I checked it with my Arcturus calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in , and then I wrote some more , and the more I wrote the better I felt , and I stopped and thought , " But if he does not die there is no book in it , and all my work is for nothing , " and then I thought , " That will be good , " and then I thought again , " Still , if he dies or not it might still be a book at that , " and I went on writing until I simply could not keep my eyes open and went to bed and fell asleep pitching . If I give us 10 or 12 runs in the first inning I can make it the dullest game on earth and fall asleep easy . We seen Holly and Michele in the afternoon , and Pop drove me to the train , and I brung cigars back for the boys and passed them around , and they all said " Congrats " and said they hoped she would not grow up and look like me , and I said I hoped so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Washington , and we picked up a game . It was not much , nothing like what we would of liked , but it was something.  |p170Goose  caught . The 3 days of rest over the All-Star Game done him a lot of good , and when he tired Jonah took over , for the power was on . Sid slammed Number 30 off Rob McKenna and was the talk of the town the way he was hitting left-handers , and Number 31 Sunday , which was the day I racked up Number 15 , worth $1,5oo . It paid off the baby and a lot of little debts we been carrying on the books for quite some time . Sid was one up on Babe Ruth . Bruce broke into the lineup on July 19 . He caught the whole St. Louis series , the first time he caught 3 games in a row since Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday , August 15 , 16 , and 17 , 1951 , according to the paper , and he caught the first night against Pittsburgh , and done well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball game , for it rained all day and the ground was soaked and should of never been played to begin with , and then when we got back to the hotel his father called and said his mother died , and Bruce spoke to him and hung up and looked at me and smiled and said , " She died , " glad she died before she knew , and he called Katie , and she begun bawling on the phone and said she would be right down and help him pack , and she come , and we went to the airport with him , Katie crying all the way . When he was in the air she said , " Leave us drink a drink together and drown our sorrow , Author , plus which I must discuss a little matter of business with you . " " I personally rather put away a good meal after a ball game and anyhow never drink , " said I. " No doubt such a meal has that extra zip to it when somebody else picks up the tab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , " said I , and we went back in town to The Green Cow , same place we all ate MemorialDay night . P171We ate in a private room , and after the food come she chased the waiters out and pulled the curtain . " Author , " she said , " I have here 2 letters phonier than a rubber bat , " and she shoved 2 or 3 of the Arcturus letters that Holly wrote under my eyes . " You may see but not touch , " she said , " for any day I am libel to run these up to Boston and inform the Arcturus Company that one of their agents is trying to swindle one of their fully paid-up insurees out of the right to change their beneficiary , which will win you the heave from Arcturus and blackmail you out of the insuranceracket forever and a day . " " They will laugh in your face , " said I. " I doubt it , " she said , " because I doubt that they will like the looks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such people working for them by these names because they are the names of very famous writers up in Boston quite some years back . " She put them back in her purse . " The day you open your yap to the Arcturus Company , " said I , " I will stroll up to the police department on 66 Street and swear out a complaint against a certain whore-house . " She laughed . " I am not anxious to go up to Arcturus , " she said , " and I see no reason why me and you must have all this fuss and feathers between us . Who in hell are you protecting ? His mother is dead and his father is a farmer . What does a farmer need with $50,000 ? The price of oats ai n't gone up that much . " " It is the principle of the thing , " said I. " I hate to see a man get took for a ride . " " What principle of what thing ? " she said . " He been gettingtook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on him stole something off him . He is not only from thep172country but he is dumb from the country , and on top of that from the dumbest part of the country there is . He ai n't even from Texas or Wyoming where the Lord knows they are dumb enough to begin with , but from Georgia . If he wound up in the black he would not feel natural , which he will not wind up in anyhow because if we do not take his money from him the doctors and the insurance companyand the undertakers will get there before us and swindle the old man dizzy no sooner than the grave is dug . " " No doubt you are right , " I said . " There is nothing illegal in it , " she said . " You are only doing what your customer asks you . " " He is more than only a customer , " I said . " He is my friend . " " And what does your friend wish ? He wishes to marry me . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them goddam Change of Beneficiary forms down here from Boston . I will tell you another thing , Author , which I been saving for the dessert . " The waiter brung the dessert and she told him close the curtain behind him again on the way out and disappear unless she rung , and she leaned forwards a little and she said , " Author , the day those forms are signed and sealed and sitting in the palm of my hand you are the lucky owner of a golden lifetime pass to 66 Street , summer and winter where the game is never called because of rain and where every day is a doubleheaderfor any young man with red blood . I got a girl 7 feet tall for you , Author , and another only half your size , never the same girl twice , girls just off the boat from Honolulu . Give a glance at a map of the world and tell me where you want a girl from and what language she shouldp173speak , girls that kings could not buy out there in them Arabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will make you think you are being struck by lightning , and girls that will make you say , " Never mind Heaven because it can not match 66 Street , " girls every color of the rainbow , you name it , brown girls , yellow girls , white girls , black girls , red girls , brown hair , black hair , blonde hair , red hair , girls that already forgot more tricks than they know , all ages from 16 to 60 , all sizes and shapes , and never the same one twice . " " I already got a girl , " I said . " Buy your girl a tinkler for her arm , " she said . " I noticed her arm was bare , " and she went back in her purse again and pulled out a check for $2,500 , made out to The Green Cow . " I will ring for the waiter , " she said . " Put it back , " said I , and she put it back and pulled out another , $5,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cash , " she said , and he took the check and went and brung back cash , 50 bills , 100 each , and she laid them on my plate , where my pie was but was no more , for I ate it , and I looked down at it , and I rung the bell , and the waiter come again . " I rather have more pie , " I said , and I handed him the plate , and he looked at me , admiring me , and he give Katie back the cash and went and brung another hunk of pie . She stuffed it in her purse and got up in a hurry . " You will be hearing from me , " she said , and out she went.  |p174TALK  ABOUT crazy coincidences , I was writing along in my book , still only the first chapter , and hit the part where I called Joe from the airport in Chicago when right that minute he shoved in opposite , and he said , " Should we not send flowers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys . " Like who ? " he said . " Me and Goose and Horse , " I said , and I folded up my papers and stuck them in my pocket . " The club also sent some . " " You writing another book , Author ? " said Joe , and he laughed . He had n't spoke a nice word to me in weeks . " No , " I said . " About you and Pearson ? " he said . " What makes you think so ? " said I. " Nothing , " he said . He looked out the window . " Do not write another book until I read the first one . I can not keep up with you . I ai n't even bought a copy yet . I am a little strapped this year . " " $3.50 is all it takes , " said I , " or 350 in the quarter books . That ai n't very steep , Joe . " " Who else sent flowers ? " he said . " Nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enough , " he said , and up he got and crossed the isle and collared Roberto Diego and told him tell George fork over $3 . George give only one . Joe said , " 3 , George , I said 3 , " and he held up 3 fingers , and George dug back in and come up with the other 2 , and then he spoke a lot of Spanish to Diego , probably swearing . I do not know more than 6 words in Spanish that I learned playing winter ball in Cuba , but I believe I know swearing when I hear it , and Joe moved on down the isle , and every seat he stopped at he held out his hand , and somebodyput a dollar in it , and he looked at the dollar and said , " Is this all you can part with ? I pity you . You can no doubt part with 4 for a silk necktie , or drop 5 at poker , or fill up your gas tank and think nothing of it , but ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow 's mother and suddenly their pocket is locked and the key is in the river , " and the boys all went back in their pocket again and brung out more , and Joe went down in the other car and cornered the boys at cards , and after awhile he come back and give me $6o about , and the next time the train stopped I sent the flowers . I did not know what type to send . I do not know too damn much about flowers . The telegraph girl said , " Never mind , I will send the right type . How do you wish to sign the card ? " and I signed it " From the boys , with deepest regrets and sympathy , " and I wrote down all their names , and she copied them off , all but " Piss . " She got all red and said we could not send such a word on the wire , and we changed it to " Sterling . " " It would be easier just saying " From all the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I , " send it like I wrote it , " and that was how it went.  |p176I  kept the list . I have it yet . You start saving everything once you start writing a book , and every little thing brings back memories all their own , like in the song . I do n't know how Joe knew . I never asked . Goose or Horse must of told him , and I was quite mad at them for a minute , and then it passed . Who told Goose after all but me ? And then when he knew he could only carry it around so long until he had to tell somebody else , like carrying heavy bags that you have either got to change them around from hand to hand or stop and sit on them awhile or else finally break down and pay a redskin to help you , or if you do n't tell somebody you might start writing it down and get it off your chest that way , telling paper . Wednesday they hit Chicago , Bruce and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys all stood up , for the old man if not Bruce , and Bruce said " Howdy boys " and started getting dressed . " Do you feel like playing ball right away ? " said Dutch . " Yes , sir , " said he . " I do . " " Good , " said Dutch . " Boys , we lost 2 ball gamesto a club we should fat up on every time if Mr. Pearson will pardon the expression . I do not generally use such an expression except under unusual circumstances . " " That is all right , " said Mr. Pearson . " I heard them once or twice down home . " He took off his coat and sat down on a pile of towels . His suspender kept drooping down over his shoulder . " I guess you did at that , " said Dutch . " I am suppose to be responsible for the character of these young men and do not wish you to think I ever forget it for a minute . Butp177you come at a bad time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose up my rear when they should of been shook by June . Leave me introduce you around , " and he introduced Mr. Pearson to the coaches and the boys , and he went up and down the line and shook their hand . Every time he shook it his suspender flopped down again , and he snapped it back up , shake , flop , snap , shake , flop , snap . Him and Dutch moved down towards the colored boys , and I held my breath a little , not knowing if he would shake their hand or not , but he done so , and then he went back and sat on the towels . " I am going to bat right-hand power and see if we can not beat this wind , " said Dutch . " What a place to build a park ! You might as well build it uphill . Hanging is too good for the built this ball park . Longabucco will play in left and hit for Vincent Carucci . Pasquale , you hit 8 and Goldman 7 , Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that leave open ? " " That leaves Pearson in the 5 spot if that is the way you wish it , " said Egg . " Probably you made a mistake in your thinking . " " I guess I know what I wish , " said Dutch . " He batted in the 5 spot in the Alabama State Amateur Baseball League down there , " said Mr. Pearson , " and also when he was with the Cowboys . He will live up to your faith , for one thing that keeps him sitting on top of the world is your faith in him . " Clint and Egg shook their head " No . " " I hope he has got a better grip on the top of the world than we have got on the goddam pennant race , " said Dutch . " I am probably out of my mind batting him 5 , but a man must take a desperate gamble when God himself is against you , blowing a wind in like that against your left/hand power . No ! I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does that look ? " Clint and Egg shook their head " No " some more . " Why not shove Goldman in there in the 6 spot ? " said Egg . " And follow Pasquale right after , " said Clint . " A catcher works hard , " said Joe . " You should not bat him too high in the order . " " He is fast , " said Mr. Pearson , " and young , and great in his faith in you . " " Fast as a dear , " said Dutch , " and that is a fact , and my faith in him is greater than ever . I believe this might be his year at last , but the truth of it is I must trust in the word of my staff , and I will move him back to the 8 spot after all . There is nothing personal in that . " " That will keep you from having too many right-hand hitters in a row anyhow , " said Joe . " It will prove your faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dutch . " I guess it will at that , " said Mr. Pearson , though I supposehe might of wondered how . I myself wondered but said nothing , never speaking unless spoke to after pitching a bad ball game , which I just got done doing in the first game , though actually not too bad of a job now that I look back at the clips but one Coker and Perry threw away behind me , messing up a double play at a poor time , plus some better umpiring might of helped , plus also the wind . Perry said if I stopped thinking so damn much about the bonus clause I might of been more effective , which was a lie and I said so , and Goose said if I threw anything stupid a-tall it was Jonah 's fault , and Jonah said one more remark like that out of Goose he would start separating somebody 's head from their shoulder if it was n't against the law top179murder old men , and there would of been some really nasty things said except it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second game , and we won , which I was glad for , his father sitting up behind the dugout watching . He only seen Bruce play for the Mammoths once before , coming north for the 52 Series when Bruce pinchrunfor Swanee Wilks in the fourth game , Swanee now managing the Mammoth farm in Appalachia in the Ind-0-Kent League , Class C , where Bruce broke into the organization . We won with the power off but the right-hand hitting putting singles together , Blondie Biggs going good for 7 innings until needing relief , Horse finishing up , Horse very effective all during that swing which if he had n't of been would of meant " Curtains . " That night we sight-seen around town , me and Bruce and his father and Horse and Goose and Joe in Joe 's car , Michigan Boulevard and the stockyards and Soldier 's Field where General McCarthy pinned the medal on Goose , and State and Madison , the busiest corner in the world , and we circled around the other ball park , where I myself never played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove through the South Side , blocks and blocks of colored houses , everybody hanging out the window for a breath of air . Mr. Pearson was very impressed with the whole town and said he wished his wife ever seen it , and Horse said , " Well , you will tell her about it when you see her again , for we all must die . " " I will , " he said . " I been keeping a track of things to tell her . " " No sense keeping a track , " said Joe . " You will have millions of years to think back , all the time in the worldp180up there out of the hustle and the bustle and the heat . It will be a better place than Chicago . " " Lay it on thin , boys , " said I to myself , and we went to Joe 's and drunk beer , or at least they did , for I do not drink , and Joe 's Mrs. waited hand and mouth on Bruce , running back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even only looked like he needed one , and I knew she knew but never give it a thought , though in the end she was the one left the cat out of the barn and blew the roof off things . Me and Bruce and his father and Horse went back to the hotel , and we gassed a long time , the 4 of us , and the old man slept in the room with Bruce , and I spent the night with Horse . The last thing Horse done before bed he fished out this little pencil about an inch long and a hunk of hotel paper , and he sat writing in his shorts , probably a half an hour or more , and I said , " I hope you are not writing a book , for a club has got room for only one Author at a time . " " No , " said he , " I am writing a letter home , but I am a slow writer , " which he certainly was because in a half an hour he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , " said he , " I am out of practice and anyhow can never think of a thing to say . What in hell is there to say ? All my life I double-timed her , and all I can say is I will try and see if I can stop for once . She will not even believe me . " He licked the flap closed and stuck it in the door of the medicinechest . " She might , " I said , " if you sound sincere enough . " " Sincere ? " he said . " Goddam it , that is a good word , " and he went and got the envelope again and ripped it open and squeezed another sentence in and wrote a newp181envelope and licked it and stuck it back in the medicine chest and turned out the light and got in bed , and we talked some , and first time in 4 years up that I ever really talked to the fellow , and he is not a bad fellow a-tall when he tries . Bruce caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 4 . Washington split 2 that day in Pittsburgh , and we left for Cleveland 2 games to the good . The old man could not decide if he wished to go on to Cleveland with us or go out to Seattle and stay with his daughter awhile , and finally he decided on Seattle , saying " Goodby " in the clubhouse and shaking hands all around again , and some of the boys said , " Do not leave us , for we won 2 in a row since you come . " " I believe you will start shaking Washington for good pretty soon without me , " he said . " Besides , " said I , " if he stays and we lose everybody will start blaming it on him . " Everybody laughed . " I will be back and luck you through the Series , " he said , and we said we hoped so , which we certainly did . Bruce caught the west through , every day , which the paper never noticed , all the writers probably thinking tomorrowor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the power was on , or Goose if it was cool , and then when they noticed it they noticed it all at once and busted out in a rash of articles called CAN THE MAMMOTHSWEATHER THE STRETCH WITHOUT A CATCHER ? There was a drawing of Dutch one day called GETTING TO SLEEP ON HOT NIGHTS , showing Dutch in bed counting catchers jumpingover a fence , and every catcher was Red Traphagen.  |p182Bruce  read them and never give them a thought , or if he did never mentioned them but only went on playing ball , and we kept floating , never gaining but at least never dropping back , 2 , 212 , 2 again , OA , back up to 2 , all through the west , staying alive with pitching some days and power the others , never putting the 2 together like we should of been doing on paper , Sid blowing hot and cold , hitting 4 in 3 nights in St. Louis after not hitting one for a week , and then not hitting another until back east again , neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Babe hit 17 in September of 27 , according to the paper . We knew Sid would never make it . We only hoped nobody else got as hot as Babe Ruth in September , Washingtonor even Pittsburgh or Cleveland , because if anybodyreally got hot it was their chips to rake in October . He only went on playing ball , Bruce did , hitting pretty good , keeping a book on pitchers and never much getting fooled twice in a row any more . Dutch moved him up to the 7 spot and shoved Coker back to 8 , Coker in a terrible slump , finally yanking Coker altogether and playing Ugly and hoping Ugly 's legs would hold up until Coker got back his eye or his timing or whatever it was made him slump . He never really knew , and in the end what I believe it was it was his nerves give out . Doc Solomon said the same and put him on sleeping pills . I do not mean Bruce busted down fences left and right , but he hit solid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way and a little the other , talking to himself up there and looking fierce and crowding in , getting dusted more than once , pitchers trying to talk him back and keep him from tagging the curve , which he done more and more now , picking it up when it broke . He begun wearing a protective helmet . Yet everyp183time they dusted him he come back off the ground and crowded in again , same as before , hitting right-hand pitchingas good as left and sometimes better , and pushing a good many drives into the opposite field . Pasquale dropped in one night and said , " Me and my brother been thinking . Why not loosen up your grip more ? " and Bruce thought about it and said , " I will try it , " and he done so , getting more wrist in his swing and driving a longer ball and saying a few nights later , " I believe I must go and thank them for the tip , " and going and never coming back until I begun getting worried and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joe and a flour salesman . He played every day between Chicago when he got back from the funeral and Labor Day , baseball I mean , not Tegwar . But he was no catcher , and many a time I wondered if maybe the one mistake Mike Mulrooney ever made was making a catcher out of him instead of an outfielder . He would of never been a top-flight outfielder neither , but not being an outfielder is not so dangerous as not being a catcher , and there were days when I was sure Dutch was about to say , " To hell with the power , " and send Jonah back in . To Bruce a pitcher is only a fellow throwing the ball , and a catcher is only there to stop it and keep the game from dragging , which is not what a pitcher is and not what a catcher is except maybe in the Alabama State Amateur Baseball League , which is why it is the Alabama State Amateur Baseball League and not New York . A pitcher is a fellow with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stick of wood in his hand , trying to keep the manp184with the wood from hitting the baseball solid because if he hits it too many times the pitcher becomes a man without a job , and he is throwing with his arm and his brain and his memory and his bluff for the sake of his pocket and his family , and he needs help . His catcher must help him , must also be brain and memory and bluff , not only just stop the ball in case the hitter do n't . A man 's catcher must be eyes and ears , watching runners , watching wind , watching the lay of the land behind the box , watching the board , watching signs , picking up everything the pitcher might miss , which Bruce never was , this year nor any other in all his life , for he never loved catching that much . He loves hitting . He wishes you could hit and not be bothered with catching , loving to do only the one thing he does best , which in many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block of cement and do only the one thing a block of cement can do and call it " Football , " or you can be 7 feet tall and stand around dropping balls in a basket and call it " Basketball , " or you can whack a little ball and walk after it and whack it again and walk some more and call it " Golf . " But these are not baseball . Catching he was never thinking , only going through the motion , only picking up his gear from the floor and strappingit on and pulling his mask down over his face and grabbing his mitt and reaching up on top of the dugout for his sponge , always putting it there to dry out between innings , and going out and taking a couple warm-up throws and firing to second and crouching down and looking for his sign , then stopping the pitch in case it got past the hitter and firing it back out , firing high or low or howeverthe mood hit him , not saving his pitcher , only keeping the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picking up his sign again if he could figure out where it was coming from , half the time not knowing who the hitter was , not knowing the umpire behind the plate , only crouching there until the pitch started coming , sometimes leaning on his arms , his mitt flat in the dust , his arms hanging like these monkeys in the zoo , until when he took the pitch his mitt sent up a little puff . And when the side was down he put his sponge back on top of the dugout and sat down in his gear and wiped the juice off the chin of his mask and threw the mask on the floor . " Who swipes ? " he said , and if it was his , or his soon , he jumped up and dropped the rest of his gear and grabbed a bat , loving to hit but not loving to catch , like Jonah Brooks loves catching but not hitting . What Dutch finally decided was he needed his hitting catcher the most , and shut his ears and stopped reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home through the third swing west , and it worked , for we stood above water . The boys mostly laid off him . If they ragged him they had not only me to answer to but Goose and Horse , and later Joe . They begun ragging Diego Roberto , believing he was bad luck . Diego believed the same , saying Josh Klang put the double whammy on him , Josh the Boston coach and a great kidder . Diego and George started scrappingbut could not tell me what about . I think George thought Diego was giving away certain confidential mattersbehind his back in English , which he was , but whether they were the same things George thought they were or not I never found out . Diego said they were not , but George 's side of the argument I got through Diego , which probably loaded the stack against George , and in the end they never settled it , or if they did they did it withoutp186any help from me . I can say " Which way to the ball park ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when I went to Cuba , " Ah dondey estar el estadio bazeball ? " which folks on the street understood all right , especially if I also carried my glove . I lugged my damn glove all over Cuba . It was my turn to work Thursday night in Brooklyn , but Washington got beat by Boston in the afternoon and Dutch felt he could gamble , saving me to shoot at Washington Friday night , which I never thought a thing about until Friday morning Winston Waters called , the saloon writer , and he said , " I do believe Dutch is skipping your turn on orders from the club to keep you from cashing in too much on your bonus clause . " " No comment , " I said . " Is it not possible ? " he said . " No comment , " I said . " It is possible the morning dew will wash away the park . " He hung up , and he wrote in his column that I said such a thing was " possible , " and Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably the best job I turned in since the 2-hitter Memorial Day . I give up 4 hits , and Sid hit 39 and 40 . I was now 17  --  8 on the year . It was the largest Friday night crowd in August since Friday night , August 12 , 1949 , according to the paper . Van Gundy beat them Saturday , another great crowd , but we lost Sunday . It was the largest 3-day crowd for weekend singletons in August since August 17 , 18 , and19 , 1945 , and the cushion was now 3 full games . Everybody breathed a little easier than they breathed in a long time . After the Sunday ball game we sat around drying off and not feeling too sorry for ourself , quiet , not ragging any/body and not scrapping , which I rather hear quiet than horseshit , although too much quiet puts me in the gloom after awhile , and Ugly said , " Exactly when in hell will it all be over ? " Lindon had a schedule taped on his locker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That gives me 6 weeks , " said Sid , " to hit 21 home runs in 42 days and beat Babe Ruth . " Everybody laughed . " Probably we can hang on for 6 weeks all right at that , " said Coker . " I wish it was tomorrow , " said Canada . " I wish it was yesterday , " said Lawyer Longabucco . Bruce spoke to me in a quiet voice . " Tell them they are wishing their life away , " he said . He never speaks up in front of everybody but says it to me first , saying , " Tell somebody this or that , " never lifting his voice unless asked . " You are wishing your life away , " I said . " I am only wishing 6 weeks away , " said Canada . " Not my life . " " I wish I could go to sleep tonight and wake up on the 25th and be done with it one way or the other , " said Lindon . " We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should of shook the son of a bitches by July , " said Pasquale . " Who have they got ? What keeps them on the up ? " " That Revak is not a bad ballplayer , " said Vincent , " nor that Opper nor that kid that pitched Friday night . " " That is 3 , " said Pasquale . " You would not wish to sweat blood until you can name another . " " It could go on , " said Bruce , speaking up now . " I even do not mind catching too goddam much any more . "  | " Nobody ever accused you of catching , " said Jonah . " You shut your fat black mouth , " said Goose . " Shut up , boys , " said Ugly . " It was only a little joke , " said Jonah . " Little jokes wind up in big bloody messes , " said Goose . " I said shut up , " said Ugly . " I like sweating , " said Bruce . " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there and seeing how high you drove it . " " I do not like popping out , " said Sid . " Even high . " " Still and all I do not mind , " said Bruce . " He is in love , " said Herb . " With a pure bride , " said Perry . " I love stinking , " said Bruce , " and coming in and ripping off your clothes and getting under the shower and thinking about eating , " and he sat thinking over what he said , and the more he thought about it the better it sounded , and he went and showered , and the boys all done the same.  |p189MONDAY  WAS open , and we drilled . Dutch was not at the drill . Somebody said his Mrs. hit town , and Clint run the drill . Afterwards we went and sung on Charles Marschand 's TV Supper Club , 6o apiece , peanuts , me and Bruce and Horse and Goose , calling ourself The Mammoth Quartet . A lawyer called me up a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coker and Canada for stealing the name unless I wished to settle out of court , and I said , " Go ahead and sue me , pal , " and I hung up the phone and never give it another thought until just this minute . It all comes back . On the same show they had these Three Harmonettes , pretty little blondes that swang their ass while they sang , and Bruce got all hotted up and went up to Katie 's , and I went back the hotel and done some writing , whipping through Aleck Olson in Minneapolis and down to where I was eating away in that kosher restaurant in Rochester , Minnesota , actually the last meal I ever ate before I knew about Bruce when you stop and think about it , and the telephone rung , and it was Red from San Francisco , California . " Author , " said he , " what is up ? I got 2 wires and 2 telephone messages saying call Dutch , and I wish to bep190filled in before I do .

" I am ashamed to say , " said he . " It is not enough to live on , and we are in the poorhouse . I believe I might get used to it in a few years . " " At least you do not split fingers , " I said . " That is true , " said he . " It is a job where when your legs give out you can sit down and still hold it , " said I. " A lot of boys wish they had such a fix to look forward to .

" You never pass a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddam it anyhow , by the time you are old enough to have more sense than power you realize you alreadypissed away the most exciting days of your life .

" " I would not , " he said , " because I am under contract to fill out the year here , and because I keep laughing every minute , and because I wish to finish up a book I am writing , and because I would like to see if you boys can cop the flag which you should of copped by now .

" I wish you would tell me what is up . " " I will nose around and call you back , " I said . " Collect . " " Sure , " he said , " and be quick , " and he give me his number and I wrote it down on top of one of my pages and stuck them in my pocket and went and pushed the elevator . I give a couple elevators the go-by until finally Peter come , and I told him ride me up and down empty once or twice . " What is new ? " said I. " Dutch 's Mrs. is here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and he took a couple puffs on his cigar . He leaves a cigar burning on top of the fire-box up there . He laid it back on top of the box and we got back in and started down again . " Patricia is also here , " he said . " Tootsie can tell you more . The long distance been flying far and fast all over creation . " I got out on the lobby and bought some cigars and took them back and give them to Peter , and I strolled over and said to Tootsie , " Tootsie , I never seen you looking quite so gorgeous before . " " It sure was good to hear Red , " she said . " And he was right , every word he said . You should of shook them long and long ago . It is not your fault , Author , for you are 17 and 8 on the year and been pitching your heart out , but something is wrong beyond understanding .

I only catch a little bit now and again but I do not believe they are getting any satisfac-tion . " " Concerning Pearson ? " I said . " Certainly , " she said . " Who else ? " " What is wrong with Pearson ? " said I. " I do not know . They are talking this medical doubletalk . I believe he has a leak in his blood somewheres . For 2 more grandstands on the following day I heard something else . " " Sold , " said I. " You are in the doghouse because of the bonus clause in your contract . " " The bonus clause ? " said I. " Certainly , " said Tootsie . " What else ? " " How did they find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out about Pearson ? " " Dutch 's Mrs. , " said Tootsie . " She heard it off Mrs. Joe Jaros who heard it off Joe who heard it off you who heard it off Goose Williams , for Goose was in Rochester , Minnesota , all winter with Pearson . They got some kind of a big hospital out there . Third-base side , Author , lower deck , not too far back and not behind no pillars nor posts . " I called Red from a pay phone , and I told him what was up , the whole truth , and he said he would call Dutch and try and jack the pay up a little and fly on in , and I went up to Dutch 's sweet and knocked , and they said " Comein.  |p193Everybody  was there , Dutch and his Mrs. and Patricia and the coaches and Ugly and Doc Loftus and Doc Solomonand 2 lawyers , one a man and the other a lady . " Good evening to all , " I said . " So ! " said Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of it . " " Good evening to you , " they said . They all sat around not talking . My contract was on the table in front of the lawyers , and every once in awhile they picked it up and looked at it and threw it down again . I waited for somebody to say something , and finally Patricia spoke up . " I never heard of anything quite so terribly horrible , " she said . " I can not understand why I am not crying . " " Keep your hanky handie , dearie , " said Dutch 's Mrs. , " for it first must penetrate your skull . I myself thought nothing of it when she told me but only went about my business shucking my shoulders until all of a sudden it knocked me down . " " You keep thinking it could be your own , " said Joe . " I started dreaming these dreams . " " Do you not think , " said Dutch , " that we already discussedit enough as far as how very terribly horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tomorrow is a baseball game as usual and we are no nearer knowing than before . " He looked at me now . " Author , " he said , " you got us into this , so now get us out . " " What is the problem ? " said I. " The problem is what to do , " said he . " If you will back out of your clause like a man we can release him and bring in some protection , which I doubt that you will have the kindness and decency to do but would rather go on knifing us in the back . I admire you for it , believe me . I knew something was up when I left you put the clause inp194but had no sleep in several nights due to that goddam motorcycle driver , which the idea of putting up with the rest of the summer makes my belly crawl .

" Hello there yourself , " said Red . I could hear his voice but I could not hear the words . " It would all sound fine to me , " said Red , " except I can not leave here . They can not find another man on such short notice . " " To do what ? " said Dutch . " They can find 40,000 men in a minute . " " I am making money hand over fist out here , " said Red . " Horsefeathers , " said Dutch . " Nobody makes money in such a racket but the football coach . I will up it 331/3% and not one penny more .

" Tell him I also said hello , " I said . " Author also says hello , " said Dutch.  | " Sold , " said Red , and Dutch hung up . " Somebody rememberand can Diego Roberto when Red hits town , " he said . " Every cloud got its silver lining . " The lawyers looked at the contract again , and Dutch looked at me , and then away . " I still believe we are in title to some help from the Commissioner , " he said . " Cleveland was helped when Mays killed Chapman if memory fails me . Why Cleveland and not New York ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this room both at the same time , " said Joe . " Then we must let it out , " said Dutch , " except she says it would not be human . Yet is it human to lose the flag ? What have you thought up yet , Doc ? " " Nothing else , " said Doc Solomon . " We been thinking . " " You are a slow thinker , " said Dutch . " You must be calm , " said his Mrs. " You must think of the boy . " " I am thinking of the boy . I been thinking of nobody but the boy all afternoon and all night and am not libel to stop . It is more thinking than I done about him in my life before . He was $1,000,000 worth of promise worth 20 on delivery . It is Mike Mulrooney 's fault , goddam his Irish soul if you will pardon the expression . " He looked at the lady lawyer . " I am not Irish , " said she .

Do you mean to tell me he is libel to die without any warning ? Why in hell do they call it that ? "  | " Piney Woods , " said Ugly . " That was it , " said Dutch . " My good hope from Good Hope , Georgia . " " It is named for Hodgkin , the man that discovered it , " said Doc Loftus . " Maybe he knows something about it , " said Dutch . " Is he alive himself ? Maybe he thought up a cure by now which those jugheads out in Rochester , Minnesota , ai n't heard about yet . What kind of a place is that to have a goddam hospital , anyhow , out there in the wilds of nowhere ? Does a man not freeze his ass off by the time they get him in bed ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have got some of the best-paid amateur leagues in the country out there , " said Ugly . " You ought to know , " said Dutch to me . " You were there . You sneaked out there in the middle of the winter , and all the rest was hokus , Mary Pistologlione and hunting on the ice and gags by telephone and miracle drugs for the clap . Then I hired a goddam detective . What was his name , Author , anyhow ? " " Rogers , " I said . " Mr. Rogers . " " Fine name , " said Dutch . " He could not detect cowflopin a barnyard . " " Leave us go sleep on it , " said Patricia . " We will decide something , " and we went . But I do n't think they ever decidedanything , or if they did they never left me in on it . Red come in and coached catchers , and Mike come in and kept Bruce 's spirit high , and Piney with him , just in case . Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . We lost to Brooklyn , Washington beating Boston and chipping the cushion to 2.  |p197THE  FIRST the boys knew anything was up , PineyWoods walked in the clubhouse in Brooklyn Tuesday nightwearing cowboy clothes , pants and shirt and a 10-gallonhat and high-heel boots and a rope and a gun on his beltand carrying a guitar . " Howdy , partners , " he said . " Howdy there , Piney partner , " the boys all said . " Did you come in by horseback from QC ? " said Gil . " No , partner , " said Piney , " we flew . " " Did you stop and camp along the way and cook up your grub by the fire ? " said Herb . " No , " said Piney , " we ate on the plane . " " Who is we ? " said Sid . " Me and Mike , " he said , and the boys all begun wonderinghow come Mike come . " How come Mike ? " they said . " I do not know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needingcatching protection . " " We been needing no such a thing , " said Goose . " Pearsonbeen doing a man-size job . " " Probably they shipped you along to water the coyotes , " said Horse , " and keep the rustlers out of Brooklyn . " " I guess I could , " said Piney , taking his gun off his belt.  |p198He  put it up on the shelf , and it fell off , and everybody jumped . It broke open , and the bullets spilled on the floor and rolled here and there and everywhere , and he crawled around after them and put them back in . By Wednesday morning the whole of New York knew something was up . Red hit town in the morning . The paper just got through wondering all over the place why Mike was there , and now Red give them new food for their fire . They begun calling everybody up and rapping on the door . The only individual in town it made no impression on was Bruce . " It sure is good to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except when Red come he said it sure was good to see Red , and he looked in the paper and told me who said what , saying , " Tex O'Malley says in his column Dutch is on the outs with the Moorses and being canned , " and saying " Winston Waters says in his column Dutch is splitting with his wife , " and saying " Krazy Kress says in his column Piney Woods is a sure bet for 56 , " and I kept waiting for the paper to stop hitting around it and learn the truth , which I doubted O'Malley or Winston Waters would ever do , though Krazy might of , for he is quite a writer about 2 shots in 5 , and then when he closed the paper Red come busting in , and I got out of bed and never went back . He was looking very white . " I live in a foggy part of the town , " he said , and he sat down and we talked , the first time we seen him in over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sat down , and Goose and Horse , and I sent for coffee for all , though by the time it come Ugly and Joe drifted in , and I sent the boy back for more , and then Patricia come and I got back in bed on account of thesep199pajamas I hang out in . Somebody should invent pajamas with zippers , though to tell you the truth she is far from the blushing type . And writers come , and they said , " Tell us what is up , boys , " and dragged chairs in and sat down and looked around and drunk coffee . " I can not figure it , " said Krazy . " All of you here that I doubt I ever seen in one room before , people that never hung together in their life off the ball field , " which was true when you thought about it , for Red has no use for Patricia , and Patricia none for Ugly , and Mike none for Red , and Goose and Horse no use for anybody but themself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after awhile they stopped asking , and they left , and the boy kept bringing coffee , and then food , and all of a sudden it was quite a large party for such a small room . Dutch wandered in , the first time in my life Dutch ever come to my room since the morning of Opening Day in 52 , page 198 in " The Southpaw , " 202 in the quarter book . " It looks like Pearson and Author are the most popularfellows on this ball club , " said he . " That is all right , " said Bruce . " Have a chair , " and he got up and give his chair to Dutch and sat on the window , and every so often he turned around and spit down and told what he spit , incurve or outcurve . " It is too bad a fellow can not pitch spit , " said Dutch . " I would sure have a lot of breaking stuff all right , " said Bruce , and everybody laughed very hard , too hard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lay it on thin , boys . " " I got the Mrs. off my back and on the train , " said Dutch . " I guess that is a day 's work , " said Joe.  | " I do not mind seeing her too much , " said Dutch . " She keeps me human . Probably many a boy gets the idea I am not human . Did you ever get such an idea , Author ? " " Not personally , " I said . " People sometimes tell me you are not human , but I say you are . It simply never shows . " Everybody got a great laugh out of that . " Probably you sometimes thought I was not human , " said he to Bruce . " No sir , " said Bruce . " Probably I ate you out now and then . But I never ate you out without reason . " " No sir , " said Bruce . " You ate me out for doing dumb things . " " I ate you out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the good of your own pocket , never for anything personal because you know as well as I do that personally I never had only the greatest respect for you as a human being . " " Yes sir , " said Bruce . " That was how I always felt . " " I guess I have my human side all right , " said Dutch . " Maybe not in the summer , but certainly in the winter . " " Yes , " said Mike , " you are no doubt very human in the winter . " " Or anyhow in the very coldest part , " said Red . " Leave us get over to Brooklyn , " which we done . Red put on his old number again , and Mike the same , Mike after io years in QC , and Dutch locked the clubhouseagainst the writers . It was a very large crowd for a Wednesday night . Thousands were over from New York for a sight of Red again , plus it was me vs . Scudder , always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himp201come up out of the dugout together , and there was this tremendous ovation , cheering from the Mammoth fans and booing from Brooklyn , for they always hated Red in Brooklyn , and I said , " I will bet you get nothing like this out there in San Francisco , California . " " No , " said he , " they pray that I do not show for the class , and if I am io minutes past the hour they run out laughing for a beer , " and he touched his cap , and Mammothfans begun singing " Happy Days Are Here Again , " and the Brooklyn band tried drowning them out , playing " California , Back I Come , " and the bulbs popped , and he laughed and yet cried a little . " It is a mad country , Author , and bound to go down . " " I do not think so , " I said . " I been in 4 countries , Mexico , Cuba , Canada , and Japan , and we got them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " These clucks been educated to read a scorecard . They are like the seals in the zoo , which if you feed them and give them a roof they will jump on a box and bark . Throw me a few easy until I sharp my eye a little . " I threw a few down easy , and little by little he lowered himself to the crouch . " Now I am down , " he said , " but I am not sure I will ever get back up . " I threw more . What a man he is to throw to ! He knows what you are doing before you do it , knows how you feel before you say . " You are tired tonight , " he said . " Yes , " said I , " a little . " His ear forgot nothing . He knew what was being hit where by the sound , hearing all the sounds behind him , and seeing all that went on in front , stopping and turning and watching Jonah in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonah , telling Jonah takeP202over and warm me awhile , and standing and watching Jonah , studying , studying , like you read in the paper where a fellow knew somebody died far away and sure enough he done so though nobody told him , eyes in the back of his head , eyes in front , eyes to the side of him , all eyes and ears , picking up everything eyes and ears pick up plus a few things eyes and ears miss but some other part of him picks up , his 6 sense . " You are warm , " he said , " go wash your face and run your wrist in cold water and tell Doc give you a green pill and a lemon-color pill . " " Them phoney pills ? " I said . " Wash down the green pill with a coke and the lemoncolorpill with black coffee . They will wake you up . " " They are phoney pills , " I said . " OK , " said he , " fall asleep on your feet then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce hit with one eye and Scudder warming with the other , and then we went back in and I told Doc give me a green pill and a lemon-color pill , and I washed them down with coke and black coffee , and I woke up on the spot . Mick give Red a rub and the boys come drifting in . There was no lecture that night . Dutch stood on the scale , and I thought there would be , but there was not . He only said , " Piney Woods , where is your gun ? " " In my belt , " said Piney . " Hand it here , " said Dutch , and Piney fished it off the shelf and handed it to him , the barrel end first , and Dutch turned it around quick and held it facing the floor . " I am not in the mood to see somebody laid up with a bullet wound . " " I am very careful , " said Piney .   " That is what everybody says , " said Dutch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you shoot a gun in the war ? " " No sir , " he said . " I played baseball . " " Great fucking war , " said Dutch . " Goose , you was in the war . Take and empty this gun . " " Where ? " said Goose . " At Bill Scudder , " said Sid , and everybody laughed , and Goose took the bullets out of the gun and give the works to Dutch , and Dutch put the bullets in his pocket and threw the gun back at Piney . George spoke in Spanish to Red , and Red said , " George says you should go fire it at Bill Scudder . " But George opened the ball game with a single , and Sid right away hit Number 41 with 2 gone , the first home run he hit off Scudder in 2 years , and we picked up another in the second , Bruce leading off with a single , Dutch battinghim in the 6 spot now , and going to third on another by Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coker , Coker still not out of the slump but Dutch using him against left-handers all the same . I remember Bruce scoring from third that time , standing on third with his back to the plate , waiting for the catch and then pushing off backwards from the bag and spinning and charging down the line towards home , the lights on his face , not running hard or anyhow not looking like he was running hard , though he was , no feeling in his eyes of hurry nor strain , looking at me for his sign , and I signed " Stand up , " for the throw was cut off in the infield , and he crossed home and run right on past me but circled a little and come back and stood in front of me . " What ? " I said . Hep204said nothing , only stood there a minute like he ought to said something , not go flying past a fellow without talking . " What ? " I said . " Nothing , " he said , and he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and after . Every time he connected the paper left off nosing around for the truth and rushed through a new article called WILL SEPTEMBERBE SID GOLDMAN 'S MONTH OF DESTINY ? Or SUPERHUMANTASK FACES GOLDMAN . Dutch moved him up t0 the 3 spot towards the very end to give him extra swipes . After a couple innings Red said to Bruce , " After every pitch I wish you to lay the ball in your glove and stand up straight with your meat hand down at your side . Then bring it up slow and take careful aim and fire it back at Author 's chin , " and Bruce done so . I do not know why I never thought of it . It slowed things up , and it rested me , for it kept me from reaching now clown and now up , now left and now right , which Bruce makes you do , thinking all he need dO is fling the ball back at his pitcher , never mind how . After every inning he sat by Red , and Red talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it helped . " That is right , Red , " he said . " Tell me what you see , for I know I got faults and always did . " " Yes , " said Red , " as long as I am in town anyway I will pass along what I see . " " What else do you see ? " said Bruce . " Tell me more . " " Well , " said Red , " squat even on both legs . Do not lean towards the curve . You are helping the enemy read your pitcher . " " Squat even on both legs , " said Bruce . " What else ? " " That is enough for one night , " said Red . I blanked them for 6 innings . They picked up one in the seventh , and they threatened in the eighth , and Horsep205come in and pitched out of it and went on and saved my game . He was the greatest relief er in baseball down the stretch , fat old Horse , a rock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up beer and found the Fountain of Youth instead . Old Man Moors hit town that night , though I never seen him . He was gone by morning , back to Detroit , and Patricia went back up to Maine or Vermont or wherever . She acts in shows . Red says she owns the theater . He never did like her . By the time we left for Washington Friday morning everybody was used to seeing Red and Mike around and stopped thinking too much about it . The paper cooled off on it . Everybody in the know was mum and I believed the truth had got about as far as it was going . But I was wrong . Thursday night Red said to me , " Drop up and bring your book , " and I said I would , and when I got there he was reading and George was looking at the TV , not listening but only looking , for Red ca n't stand the noise and George do n't particularly miss it . " How much you wrote by now ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . He took it and ruffled it through and laid it on the dresser , and I said , " I believe George can read and wish you would not leave it laying out . " " He already knows , " said Red , " for I told him . I could not keep it in . " George spoke in Spanish . " George says it is some shit deal Pearson been handed , " said Red . " Si , senior , " said I. " I wonder if they made a mistake , " said Red . " These doctors can be as wrong as hell when they try . " " We are all hoping so , " I said.  | " Who all knows ? " he said . " Me and his father and minister and Holly and some people Holly told up home . " " I mean on the club . " " Me and the brass and Horse and Goose and Ugly and now George , " I said . " He does not seem sad , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing and trying to improve himself . He is quick to learn , and he is certainly hitting splendid . I must tell him either chew or not chew when he hits . There is a system to his chewing , and the enemy will read him . " " He stops chewing when he tenses , " I said . " I believe so , " said Red . " But he is a much better ballplayerthan when I last seen him . " " He is gaining the old confidence , " I said . " He has more friends . He never had any before . " A little breeze blew in the window and begun sliding my pages along the top of the dresser , and I got up and sat a glass on top . " It will all be in the book , " I said . He took the glass off the pages and started reading , and when he read 6 pages he said , " I read 6 pages and it is not yet so much about him as you . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Read more , " I said . " Pretty soon I drop out of the picture , " and I went and sat by George and watched the TV , picture but no noise , a yarn about a girl and 2 men , one of the men with a black mustache pasted on . I looked for the cops to come and haul off the fellow with the mustache because it was 5 minutes before the hour , and they done so , and the girl and the shaved fellow kissed and melted out in the pitch . George never took his eye off it . He reached for a cigarette , but his eye never left the screen ,  |p207and  Red stood with my book . " I will come back , " I said . " No , " said Red , " stay . I have read enough to see that this book will never be about Pearson but about you and airline stewardesses and Goose 's wife and Aleck Olson of Boston and kosher restaurants and Holly and riding in automobiles through South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what all else by the time you are done . But it must be more about Pearson being doomeded , which is what we all are , ai n't we , me and you and George . Ai n't we , George ? " he said , and he kicked the TV and spoke in Spanish , saying in Spanish , " We are all doomeded , ai n't we , George ? " and George got up and pushed the TV back in the middle of the table and said we were in Spanish , if Red said so . " He says so too , " said Red , " but you are facingterrible odds , for George will never read your book , being trained to read a scorecard only and live like a seal . And even the people that read it will think it is about baseball or some such stupidity as that , for baseball is stupid , Author , and I hope you put it in your book , a game rigged by rich idiots to keep poor idiots from wising up to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such a thing as that in my book , " I said . " It is not true , besides which it is my bread and butter . It is a game loved by millions in 4 countries , Mexico , Canada , Cuba , and Japan . " " Stick to Pearson ! " he said . " Stick to Pearson , Pearson . You must write about dying , saying " Keep death in your mind " . " " Who would wish to read such a gloomy book ? " I said . " Everybody knows they are dying . " " They do not act like they know it , " he said . " Stick to death and Pearson . "  | " I will try , " I said , and I done so . I wrote Chapter 3 and then again 4 mostly about Bruce , like Red said to , writing right there in the room with Bruce not 8 feet away . He never asked what I was writing , and never cared , and will never read the book itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with luck and quiet . Lindon Burke worked and lost Friday night in Washington , a good job , complete , but the power was off . I felt sorry for Lindon . Sid did not pick up a base hit since his home run off Scudder the first inning Wednesday night and felt a slump coming on , which it soon did and would of meant " Curtains " only Bruce was on fire , and also Ugly . Dutch moved Bruce up to the 5 spot and Ugly 6 and later benched Sid altogether . The writers now forgot Babe Ruth and begun wondering if Sid would even equal himself as of J3 , when he hit 51 home runs . WHA HOPPEN TO GOLDMAN ? they wrote , SAD SLUMP SINKS SID 'S SPIRIT , and they give him a good deal of advice on how to pull out of it . If we had of lost Saturday we would of dropped back in a tie . This brought all Washington out hours early , and I remember the traffic was jammed and the cabbie finally turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said back over his shoulder , " You gents from out of town ? " " From good old South Turtle Landing , Arkansas , " I said . " We run the dancing school down there but flew up in a hurry thinking we might see this whizzard Henry Wiggenpitch . " Bruce started jabbing Mike in the ribs with his elbow and whispering , " This is a gag . " Mike laughed on the inside , his whole stomach shaking , but his face straight , winking and nodding at Bruce , same as saying , " I am glad you told me or I would not of knew , " thoughp209God knows Mike knows a gag when he sees one after 59 years . " If you ever pass through South Turtle Landing , Arkansas , " I said , " drop in and waltz around with us one time . " " I ai n't been out of town since 1921 , " he said . " I hope this goddam Wiggen does not pitch . We ai n't beat him more than once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-tall all summer , " said I. " Do not think you can pass out phoney information just because we are clucks from the country . We get the paper down there , and many of us can read . " " Nothing personal meant , " said the cabbie , and he turned back around and started up his motor , and Red put it in Spanish for George , Red never laughing , though George did , Red only smiling out of one side of his mouth . The cabbie drove on , saying nothing until when we got out he said , " Nothing personal meant again , but if I heard on the radio where Wiggen dropped dead tomorrow I would not shed a tear . " There was an overflow , the first time in many years down there . They roped it in the right-field corner , maybe 3,500 people . I personally thought nothing about it , figuringour left-hand power was the equal of theirs , and Dutch said the same , saying " Anyhow , is it human to fight over such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is human or not , " said Clint , " but I believe an overflow in Washington must be roped in left . It is libel to cost us the ball game otherwise , " and they sat around trying to remember the last time there was an overflow , Dutch and Joe and Egg and Clint and Mike and Red and Goose and Horse and Ugly , but none of them could , and Dutch called Krazy Kress in the press-box , saying ,  | " Krazy , do you remember where they roped the overflow the last time they ever had one down here ? " for anything Krazy ca n't remember probably never happened , and Krazy said , " Yes , Dutch old pal , I remember , only the clubhousedoor is locked in my face these days . " " It will be locked in your face forever and a day , " said Dutch , " unless you tell me . " " In left , " said Krazy , and the brass all sat down with the Washington book and figured out which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured left , and Dutch went and collaredthe umps and told them move the overflow in left , where it belonged according to the regulations , and Washingtonsaid " No ! " though knowing they were wrong . But they finally done so , the field crew unroping the ropes and hustling the fans across the grass into left . The spot the crowd was hustled out of was covered with bottles and wrappers off franks and such , and by the time the field crew swept it up the game was 20 minutes late getting under way . Washington yanked all its left-hand power and threw in right-hand power , not much , and Dutch done the same , dropping Sid to the 7 spot and Pasquale Carucci 8 and yanking Vincent Carucci altogether , batting right-hand power 1-2-3-4-5-6 , George and Perry and Canada and Bruce and Lawyer Longabucco and Coker , the first and only time in his life Bruce ever batted as high as 4 . It looked mighty peculiar , but it worked , and it was a wild and crazy ball game , your left-fielder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everybody aiming all afternoon for the overflow , popping them in there amongst the fans , 2 bases . We set all kinds of records , the most doubles in a ball game for 2 teams , the most doublesp211for one team , us , the most doubles in one inning , the most consecutive doubles , the most doubles after 2 out , the most doubles for one ballplayer in a 9-inning ball game , Bruce , the most consecutive doubles for one player in a 9-inning ball game , also Bruce , the most doubles with bases loaded and the most doubles with bases loaded in consecutive innings . We used 5 pitchers and Washington 7 , all righthanders , and it run 4 hours , and we took it , 16-11 , and the cushion was 2 again . Sunday there was no overflow . It rained , and we were late getting started again , and we sat in the clubhouse and Piney played his guitar and sung , taking off his cap and putting on his 10-gallon hat instead , and wrapping his belt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboy . You could hear the crowd shuffling around above , trying to jam in under the roof and out of the rain . Piney sung pretty good , singingAs I was a-walking the streets of Laredo , As I walked out in Laredo one day , I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen , All wrapped in white linen and cold as the clay . " Now the cowboy speaks , " said Piney . " Try a different song , " said Mike . " That is all I heard all summer . " " No , " said Piney , " it is the best of them all , " and he sung on  --  I seen by his outfit that he was a cowboy , And as I walked near him these words he did sigh , " Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story , " I am shot in the breast and I know I must die . "  | " I believe it is letting up , " said Ugly . " It is corn , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . " Leave him sing . It sounds good . " " Then the cowboy tells him his sad story , " said Piney , and he sung on again " It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing , " Once in the saddle I used to go gay , " First down to Rosie 's and then to the card house , " Shot in the breast and am dying today . " Get 16 gamblers to carry my coffin , " 6 purty maidens to sing me a song , " Take me to the valley and lay the sod o'er me , " I am a young cowboy and know I done wrong . " " Come on , boys , " said Piney . " Why do you not all join in a little ? The boys in QC sing all the time . " But nobody did , and he thumbed a bit , and then he sung it through " O bang the drum slowly and play the fife lowly , " Play the dead march as they carry me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffin , " Roses to deaden the clods as they fall . " It made me feel very sad . Yet I knew that some of the boys felt the same , and knowing it made me feel better . Not being alone with it any more was a great help , knowing that other boys knew , even if only a few , and you felt warm towards them , and you looked at them , and them at you , and you were both alive , and you might as well said , " Ai n't it something ? Being alive I mean ! Ai n't it really quite a great thing at that ? " and if they would of been ap213girl you would of kissed them , though you never said such a thing out loud but only went on about your business . Van Gundy worked when the rain stopped , and he was rocky . It is no good cooling after warming . Washington kept getting hold of little pieces of him , waiting for the curve when it did not break quite right , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the fifth , and Keith relieved , and I went down and warmed , and the crowd booed me on the way down , and I raised my arm at them and waved and smiled , like I thought booing was a compliment , and they stopped booing and laughed , and I warmed with Jonah and went in in the bottom of the eighth . The score was 5-5 . I was hot and quick . We went ahead in the tenth on a single by Bruce which drove Pasquale home , Bruce batting without his chew and using Perry Simpson 's bat , for Red told him , " A strong boy like you need only meet the ball , not murder it , so use a lighter stick , " and he used Perry 's , waiting up there for the one he was looking for , and splitting Perry 's bat on the drive , a hard smash punched through third and close to the line , and the crowd groaned but then cheered , seeing Sampson Opper coming over very fast and taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we played Tegwar with on the train that time , and digging and stopping and firing it home , a perfect throw , a great young ballplayer that I know Dutch will dicker for at the winter meetings but probably never get , and Pasquale slid in under the throw , safe , and the one was more than plenty for me . Dutch played Canada at first in the tenth , and McGoniglein center , and he sent Coker in at short for Ugly , and Jonah caught , the best defense he could field , thoughp214it was not needed , for I was still hot and quick and could of went another 5 , even with only the 3 days rest . Perry eat out Bruce for splitting his bat , and the boys all laughed , saying " Go soak your head , Simpson , " and we went back home with the cushion at 3 , the most lead we ever had all summer since May.  |p215I  BEAT Cleveland Friday night , Number 20 , August 26 , 1955 , a date which I am not libel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to The Green Cow . Katie had a girl with her , never mind her name . If I name her I am libel to be sued . I was almost sued by Old Man Moors for saying in " The Southpaw " that Patricia and Ugly had illegal relations on page 152 , 155 in the quarterbook , though I actually never said such a thing . It may of been between the lines , but certainly I can not help what relations go on between the lines . She introduced me to this girl and said , " Does her name sound familiar to you ? " " Yes , " said I , " I seen her on the TV and movies . " " Plus which , " said Katie , " she was voted Miss Industrial Progress not long ago . " " I believe I recall the event , " I said . Katie pulled the curtain . " Get up and walk back and forth a couple times , " she said , and Miss Industrial Progressdone so , and I watched her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful sick . She carried her knife and fork with her . " Thank you , " said Katie , and Miss Indus/trial Progress sat down again and went back to her food . " Tell Author what your present business address is , " said Katie. " 66 Street , " said the girl , not looking up , only eating . " Where you got a golden lifetime pass to , " said Katie , " as soon as I clap my hand over the Change of Beneficiary form we discussed not so long ago if you remember . " " I remember , " I said . " What you been doing about it ? " she said . " What am I eating ? " I said . " Do not stall , " she said . She told me what I was eating in French . " In English it means the cow 's ass , " she said . " It is awfully tasty , " I said . " Stop stalling . " " Well , " I said , " the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoot it all through . " " When ? " " I do not know . I carry no schedule with me . All I do is follow the boys on the train . " " Very well , " she said . " I will give you until you get back from Boston before I personally go up there myself and raise holy hell and pull the skids out from under you good and proper . " " Stop worrying , " I said , " before you get ulcers . I won Number 20 tonight . " " So I heard , " said Katie . " Miss Industrial Progress is a baseball fan from way back , ai n't you , honey ? " " I sure am , " said she . " It was worth $1,000 to me , " I said . " So far I picked up $6,500 in bonus money with the summer still a month from over . Do you think I am too worried about losing my insurance license ? "  | " You will not be playing ball forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " So do you , " I said . " So does everybody . " " Then why not live it up a little ? " she said . " Why worry so much about Pearson 's old man ? " " I do not know , " I said , and that was true , for I did not . Do not ask me why you do not live it up all the time when dying is just around the corner , but you do n't . You would think you would , but you do n't . " I do not know why , " I said . On the way past the desk Tootsie said , " Must be quite a celebration . " " You said it , " I said . I did n't know what in hell she was talking about , some kind of a celebration somewhere , alwayssomething going on that you never heard about or else forgot , like some days the flags are half-mast , somebodydied , some high official , some brass , and you ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you might see it in the paper tonight , and then you forget to look . In the elevator Peter said , " What are they celebrating ? " " The fassa walla dogda , naturally , " I said , and Peter said , " Oh , I must of forgot , " and I got off and started down the hall and turned the corner and heard it , and it was my room , and I pushed open the door except somebody was sitting against it and it did not push all the way , and I squeezed through , and it was full , maybe 15 boys in there and others coming and going all night . " Hats off to Arthur , " said Bruce . " Come right in and join the celebration . " " I guess I will , " I said . " I live here . What in hell is going on ? "  | " We are celebrating , " said Bruce . " So I see , " said I. " Bottoms up in honor of Author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Wash Washburn , and he flipped over and done a handstand on a chair , and everybodywatched , and then he climbed up the rungs of the back , hand over hand until he was standing on his hands on the top of the chair , and the chair swayed a little , backwardsand forwards but never falling , and everybody clapped , and then he climbed down again and jumped on the floor and begun walking across the floor , and Jonah stuck a cigarette in his mouth , in Wash 's mouth I mean , and Wash started out the room , still on his hands , and down the hall , and the first door he come to he knocked with his feet and a chap answered , a fellow in a bathrobe . I do n't know who . He is always in the lobby reading racing magazines . " Pardon me , sir , " said Wash , " but I need a match , " and the fellow went and got a match , and Wash reached up and took it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there on one arm , and he blew a puff and said " Thank you , sir " and give the chap his matches back . " No trouble a-tall , " said the fellow , and Wash walked back in the room on his hands and kicked the door shut behind him , and we all clapped , or maybe all but me . I do n't remember . I was still pretty confused and all . Holly telephoned and said " Congrats " . I could hardly hear her . I took the telephone in the bathroom . " What in the world is going on down there ? " she said . " Who is singingthat music ? " " Piney Woods , " said I. " We are celebrating . " " He is quite a horrible singer , " she said . " Celebrating what ? Number 20 ? "  | " I do not know , " I said . " I believe they are in on the truth . " " Since when ? " she said . " Since sometime in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said she , " Michele is crying , " and she run and brung her to the phone , and I flung open the door and said , " Boys ! Listen ! " and they all quietened down and Michelecried for them awhile . " Leave us sing her a lullaby , " said Jonah . " Piney old boy , sing her an old-fashion Georgia lullaby . " " I do not know none , " said Piney , " and I do not think you can play a lullaby on a guitar , but I know a song . Listen to this , honey . You just shut up now and listen , for it is a tale told by a cowboy , " and he sungMy pal was a straight young cow-puncher , Honest and upright and squareBut he turned to a gambler and gun man , And a woman sent him there . If she been the pal she should of He might of been raising a son , Instead of out there on the prairie Killed by a ranger 's gun . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started crying again , and the boys all laughed , and Holly , too , though I could tell it was laughing and crying , both . " I will sing her another , " said Piney . " Not on my bill , " I said . " It is night rates , " he said . " You just picked up another $i , 000 anyhow . "  | " Bottoms up to Author 's bonus clause , " said Coker . " Author , dear Author , " called Keith Crane in this high , girly voice , " come here and make love to me and tell your wife go feed the child . " " Who is that ? " said she . " Keith , " I said . " He is right anyhow , " said she . " I better feed her . She ai n't gained an ounce since Tuesday and I am worried sick . " " Holy Moses , " said I. " Mike , what if she ai n't gained an ounce since Tuesday ? " Mike has 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a couple weeks ago and libel to wind up playing for his old man at QC some fine day . " Lace her milk with a slug of whiskey , " said Mike . " The baby 's ? " said I. " No , " said he . " Holly 's . It will relax her mind . " " Mike says forget it , " I said . " That is what the doctor says , " she said . " She is named for me , " said Mike . " What do you boys think about that ? " " And many another baby looks like you , " said Horse , " but does not bear your name . " " That is a lie , " said Mike. " 35 years ago today I was born , " said Goose . " Bottoms up to Goose , " said Canada . " We are celebrating , " said Bruce . " Hats off ! " " He said hats off , " said Ugly , " so take off your hat , Piney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WhateverBruce says I will do , for in my opinion there is no greater catcher in baseball today . " " Lay it on easy , boys , " said Ito myself , and they sung  --   |p221Ha|p|py  birthday to you , Happy birthday to you , Happy birthday , dear Goose , Happy birthday to you . " Speech ! " they cried . " Speech ! Speech ! " and Goose stood up with a beer and said , " I will now deliver you boys my farewell speech , for when a man turns 35 he must play out the string and be gone . I believe Red was wise to quit when he did , though he had a thing to go back to while I have nothing . I was never as smart as him and never the great catcher , though I believe on any other club I would of played regular . " " It is in the past , " said Red . " Some people are born luckier than others , " said Goose . " I wish I was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my whole life ahead . I would of done it over better . " We will all be born again , " said Mike . " We are only passing through to a better deal than this . " " Maybe so , " said Red , " though I am leery of magic . " " There is no maybe nor magic to it , " said Mike . " There is time to do over again what you done wrong , even at 35 . " " You have probably got to hustle , " said Goose . " I have got too many goddam black marks against me . Nobody knows what a son of a bitch I am except her , and I do not think I can hustle that fast , plus which if she gets there first she will put the finger on me . " " She will forgive you , " said Mike . " Put an ad in the paper , " said Jonah . " Do what ? " said Goose . " Put an ad in the paper . Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell the saints you done wrong and will do better and he shoots the word up . " Red laughed and put it in Spanish for George , but George did not laugh . " Black and white all the same , " said Jonah . " I put an ad in the " Picayune " saying to my saint please do not leave me sign on with any organization but the New York Mammoths . " " What did Washington do ? " I said . " They won , " said Horse . " The son of a bitches . " Piney put his hat back on and begun thumbing his guitar . " Hats off , " said Ugly . Piney whipped it off . " What to ? " " Hats off to you , " said Ugly . " You rounded up them corralsdown there under the lonesome star and lassooed your horse and headed them off at the pass . " " I got no horse , " said Piney . " I am going to buy one in the winter and name her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One . " Hats off to motorcycles , " said Coker , and Piney reached for his hat , except it was already off . " Breed your motorcycle to your horse and come up with a horse on wheels , " said Herb . " Or a 4-legged motorcycle , " said Gil . Then they kicked that around awhile and come up with some rather unusual combinations . " Hats off to hats off , " said Coker . " Bottoms up to hats off , " and they all drunk , all but me , and they kicked that around awhile , bottoms up to bottoms up and hats off to hats off , swigging a little swig with every toast , beer only until they sent down for some whiskey to wash out the dirty old beer cans with . I begun getting undressed , for I wasp223tired , and every once in awhile somebody said , " Leave us go elsewhere , for Author is turning in , " and they talked about it but never went , and I scrubbed my teeth and sal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had and reading a book Arcturus sent me name of " Widening Your Circle of Acquaintances . " The boys kept floating in and out the bathroom , some of them getting rather tanked up by now . I got out and dried off and crawled in bed , and the boys all said , " Leave us go elsewhere , for Author is turning in . " " You do not bother me , " I said , and I pulled the cover up over my head and laid there listening , dozing off and on a little , hearing little snatches of things that now come back to me more and more while I write . I remember they talked about Sid 's slump , and I remember Mike told some stories of the old days , stories I heard in QC but forgot , and somebody read out loud from the book , " Widening Your Circle of Acquaintances , " and Bruce said he would be marryingKatie any day , and Goose shouted over to me , saying , " Author , where do you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gold nuggets and extra socks , " I said , and he went and put a bullet in Piney 's gun , or said he did . Piney said he did n't . " Very well , " said Goose , " I will dare you to point this gun at your head and pull the trigger , " but Piney would n't do it , knowing there was no bullet in it , yet not so sure . Goose said , " I will go and get a real bullet , " and I heard him leave . That was the last I heard for awhile . Yet I could hear them even while sleeping , and I kept saying to myself in my sleep , " It is all a dream . I am onlyp224dreaming . I will wake up in the morning and they will be slinging horseshit at each other again on schedule , " and I kept waking myself up every hour or so and looking around , and it was not a dream . It was real . They were sitting there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I sat up and said , " How about turning off the light and turning on some lamps ? " " I will shoot out the light , " said Goose , " like they do inthe west , " and he aimed at the light with Piney 's gun . " Why do you think a cowboy is a hero ? " said Red toPiney . " Cowboys no doubt think ballplayers are heroes . " " There is no bullet in it , " said Piney . " There is no such a thing as a hero , " said Red . " The only hero is a man without heroes . " " Will you bet $ioo ? " said Goose . " Done , " said Piney , and Goose aimed and fired , POOM ! , and people started running up and down the halls and knocking on doors and screaming " Bloody murder , " and the boys all laughed in the dark . " You will have to go west in the winter and brand up a great many stampedes to make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open up in there , " shouted the house detective , and somebody opened up and he walked in and flipped the light on , but it did not light . " Who is in the bed ? " he said . " Turn on the light , " and I reached up and turned on the bed-light . " So it is you , Author . Did you hear that shot ? " " How could I of possibly heard it , " I said . " It come from clear over the other side of the room . " " Give me that gun , " said the detective . Piney took it out of his belt . " I do not know how it got there , " he said.  | " It must of jumped in , " said Perry . " And then the belt just jumped around his waist and the hat just jumped on his head . " " Frame-up , " said Piney . " I been frame-upped . " " Is not the switch on the wall a satisfactory way enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will pay for the light and the hole in the ceiling and give me that gun besides , " and Piney give him the gun . " Come with me , " said the detective , and off they went , and I dropped back to sleep again . They were still there when I woke up . It was just coming light , and they were drinking coffee and talking , quiet , and I laid looking up at the busted light . 100 times between August 26 and the end I flipped the switch but got nothing , for the hotel never fixed it , though it was paid for , and every time I done so I remembered the night . " This night cost you a rodeo or 2 , " said I to Piney , " the $100 to Goose plus damages . " " That ai n't what a rodeo is , " he said . " We all kittied in on the damages , " said Bruce . He brung me a cup of coffee . " And Goose give him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of boys , " said Piney . " They always was , " said Bruce . But it was a sad lot of Mammoths faced Cleveland Saturday , and we lost , and no wonder , and the lead was chipped back down to 2 again , Washington beating Chicago . You can not play baseball hung over . It is not like most businesses I ever seen , insurance business , TV business , the writers , where everybody you meet is hung over or boiled , one day one and the next day the next , boiled ,
