Incredible New Frontier Nothing was ever quite like this " dream " community in the wilderness where everyone lives in a $15,000 house  --  but the big problem is keeping the womenfolk from getting cabin fever . . I n the isolated , raw and mushrooMing municipality of Kitimat , British Columbia , there 's no question about what $300,000,000 can do . Wilderness can be transformed , a powerhouse can be built 1400 feet inside a mountain , rivers can be reversed , and aluminum can be smelted profitably 5600 miles from the supply of bauxite ore . These things can be done , and have been done . The only doubt is whether any amount of money or effort can make workers ' wives like Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Wankowski or Mrs. Dimitriadis really happy in this plush-lined outpost , sufficiently contented to stop pestering their husbands about such things as the climate , the isolation or the prices in the supermarket that now stands where a bear den used to be . On this question , the happy future of Kitimat and the fine plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely depend . Empires have . hung on lesser issues . For years the flatlands at the head of Douglas Arm , one of the deep fiordlike inlets off British Columbia 's Hecate Strait , had been known to Indians as fine places to fish for aolacan ( smelt ) in the early spring , and for salmon in summer . But seven-foot snows and mud nearly as deep in the valley between huge granite mountains had caused abandonment of the only Indian village , in favor of a site down the channel . Once , when the Canadian National Railway was being driven through to the Pacific , promoters thought it might come to deep water at Kitimat ; and there had been a brief real-estate boom . But the boom collapsed about 1910 , when the rails went to Prince Rupert , instead ; and the last settler in a 100-mile-square area around Kitimat gave up in I9-14 , unable longer to stand the loneliness , the ravenous mosquitoes and deer flies , the rain  --  eighty-eight inches a year  --  or the long , dark winter nights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overage timber disturbed only by occasional fires , nobody caring that the snow-fed Kitimat River spread out , every spring , to scatter debris and gravel as a glacier had done before it . There was no way in except by sea , and few ships ventured up the long channel from the Inside Passage to Alaska . All in all , Kitimat seemed an unlikely spot for any kind of human habitation  --  let alone an industrial city , But to the Aluminum Company of Canada the area did have one decisive advantage . In the mountain lakes and at Kemano , on Gardner Canal  --  another salt-water inlet very like Douglas Arm  --  was located possibly the world 's largest potential water-power supply with neither competitive claims nor government priorities to bar its use . And aluminum smelting requires vast amounts of electricity ? ? ? , 000 kilowatt hours for every ton . This , indeed , is so crucial a factor that the long haul of bauxite ore from Jamaica , in the Caribbean . hardly figured in the company 's decision . Nor was Akan disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelter was at Kitimat , fifty miles to the north . Here there was a large tlat area , with deep-water access for ships and the possibility of rail and highway C011110Clions to the outside world . But all that was far in the future when Alain first undertook the fantastic engineering project executed here in the past the : sears : the creation or an entirely new aluminum industry , complete with enormous power supply , smelter and all the necessities to make them work , in an absolutely untouched wilderness 400 miles north of Vancouver , British Columbia . This project was heady stuff for engineers and industrialists : a 350-square-mile reservoir was created by damming the Nechako Riser high in the Coast Range mountains : a twenty-tive-foot-wide tunnel was driven through the mountain range ; a powerhouse , with 4aa,000 KVA ( kilowatt volt amperes ) and 600,000 horsepower. was built inside a mountain ; power was carried fifty miles overland across 5000-foot peaks ; and a mile-long smelter was built . Now producing 180.000 tons of aluminum annually , the smelter has already caused an industrial transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railroad from the doldrums and aided and abetted two airlines . Its product goes to the United States , the United Kingdom and Free Europe as well as to Canada 's own ballooning industries . Construction on the power plant and the smelter is continuing , and it 's entirely conceivable that in the near future this single smelter may effect major reductions in the world price of aluminum , by surfeiting the market . That is , if Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Dimitriadis and some other ladies really like living in $15,000 houses , with green lawns , good schools , and neither shanties nor goats anywhere near . When Mrs. Heber looks up from spooning cereal into her youngster 's mouth and admits , in broken English , " This is good  --  that is , my man has regular work the year around , so everything else is all right , " then 5300,000,000 has won an important victory . But it could as well have been three hundred cents when is teary blond wife , surrounded by furniture still in its packing cases , looks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last street and garbage dump , and built that way . She shrugs and announces her findings , " This is a perfect city ? Well , not for me . I 'm getting out just as soon as I can . My husband can stay if he wants to , but I 'm leaving . " That sort of thing is n't likely to stop the production of aluminum , but it does n't help . The company which spent 5300,000,000 on power and smelter and town , and contemplates additional expenditure almost as large , does n't exactly quake in its boots at the sight of a dissatisfied wife , but the look of pain on the corporate face is visible . For the town of Kitimat. although an adjunct to the aluminum enterprise itself , was decidedly not an afterthought . Wanting between 4000 and 6000 men to stay permanently  --  in addition to other thousands hired for construction  --  the company had three alternatives . It could house the smelter crews in barracks . It could build and maintain a company town . Or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This last , the boldest and in many ways the hardest scheme , was the one the company chose . From the beginning , Kitimat was planned as a town where residents could own their own homes , operate independent businesses , run their own government and pay their own bills . Into such a city , other industry might come , lessening its dependence upon aluminum or the whims of aluminum executives . And the aluminum company could avoid the permanent problems of city government , neighborhood lights and leaky roofs . Thus Kitimat first was only an idea , Battalions of planners fought the whole battle of what the town should he before it spade of earth had been turned or an acre of the dense forest cleated . Here was an opportunity for it near-perfect town , free of the structural mistakes which plague old municipalities , ready to develop with no carry-over of houses built too long ago , streets badly platted or neighborhoods gone stale . Except for a few parcels still owned by former settlers , only crown lands were involved ; and the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the over-all agreement by which the province licensed the building of the entire project . Hence , Kitimat could be planned as a whole , without interference from landholders es ho might not choose to co-operate . Clarence S. Stein , of New York , was co-ordinator and director ; and Julian Whittlesey and M. Milton Glass , also of New York , were city architects . Specialists in commercial facilities , river control , climatology , administration , recreation , education , sociology and other details were called in . For a time , few of the seaplanes which ducked between mountains to land on Kitimat 's windy Minette Bay failed to have at least one expert aboard . On paper , the result was most impressive : a city , planned for the wilderness , which would lack no detail for pleasant living . Ten self-contained neighborhoods were selected in an irregular pattern well away from the port and the smelter , chosen so that not even industrial smoke would mar their views of sea and mountains . Residential streets curved to dead ends , lawns were big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely . Greens and play areas separated groups of houses , shopping and school locations . Utilities were laid out in advance of construction . Dirty industries  --  garages , laundries , repair shops and such  --  were clustered in a service center near the railroad  --  which was not completed until well after the town was started . Space was reserved for heavy industry , close to the railroad and port , but away from housing . A suburban area was earmarked for truck farming . Impractical to control , the river was left room to overflow . A city center , to include major stores , auditoriums and government offices , was centrally located in it border of pedestrian malls and parking splices . A timetable for opening new neighborhoods would prevent haphazard growth , and the town would be protected by zoning from stringing awkwardly down the railroad or the highway still to come . Schools and municipal structures were designed to be built in stages for the expected population levels : 6000 at ? first , then 12,000 , then 25,000 ? perhaps , eventually , 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads were designed to handle the daily heavy traffic to the smelter , four miles away . Planners missed very little . Kitimat 's smelter was ready to run in 1954 . Generators turned over in the 750-foot-long powerhouse inside Mount Du-Bose , and crews , sometimes carried by helicopter , put final touches on the fifty-mile power-transmission line . But even then the town of Kitimat was only a lovely idea , without a permanent house built or a street named . First elections were held in 1953 , while all residents still were in temporary houses , trying'to keep warm when the bitter winter winds hit in from the strait , trying to keep dry in the months of rain , and arguing rights of way with bear , moose , deer , enormous ravens , eagles and an occasional wolverine . Even at this stage , the aluminum company began to step out of the municipal picture . It did underwrite many firsts : a bridge across the Kitimat River ; streets and sewers ; the first set of houses built along the edge of a plateau overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it promptly sold the houses outright , and presented both its plans for a near-perfect city and the hills for its start to the men who would have to build it and live in it . Plans could be adopted or refused , schools built or left in the dream stage , taxes cut or multiplied . Except as the taxpayer with 90 per cent of the assessed valuation , the company tried to keep its hands off . Kitimat was on its own . It 's been three years since Kitimat 's first permanent house was occupied . The permanent town population is estimated at 13,000 , plus 4000 or 5000 temporary workers still employed on company construction which may presently double the tunnels serving Kemano 's powerhouse and the size of the'smelter . This additional construction could product 2,240,000 horsepower , approximately the same electrical energy as Grand Coulee , and result in production of 550,000 tons of aluminum annually , close to half the total United States production in 1956 . Kitimat has daily plane and train service  --  over a new forty-two-mile spur from Terrace , British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady stream of ore-carrying freighters . Its first highway to the outside world , connecting with existing roads at Terrace , should be open early in 1957 . In September , 1956 , a seaplane landed me at the harbor , where the long , low buildings of the smelter appeared to fill the whole end of the valley . This smelter includes a deep-water wharf , conveyors for all materials , bank after bank of electrical rectifiers , plus the lines of 1700-degree smelting furnaces , ingot-pouring chambers and huge shipping areas serving both the railroad and water carriers . More than 2500 men now work in its heat and fumes , and all of it operates seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day . But otherwise , this dock area was just a big construction camp : a barracks ship ; long lines of temporary shore housing ; a store with counters piled high , like those of a trading post ; a great deal of noise and immense ugliness between the mountains . The railroad station , a couple of miles inland , is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel , with a beer parlor billed as Canada 's largest ; the plant of a semiweekly newspaper , plus stores and offices housed in buildings so constructed that they can be moved another mile or so to permanent locations very soon . When this happens , the station area will become the town 's service center , but will no longer be its retail hub . As yet , however , it is much like many another boom town : rutted streets , a line of customers waiting at a restaurant ; taxis with starred windshields competing for road room with dump trucks ; off-shift workers milling between the government liquor store , a post office and a barbershop . A frightened bear which invaded the hotel lobby a few months ago  --  and cleared it of loungers in record time  --  is still a topic of conversation ; and the departure of the evening train for Terrace and Prince Rupert  --  with connections at Terrace for Eastern Canada  --  a major event . This train usually carries three or four passenger cars ; and on pay nights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reasonably modern coach , which is reserved for women and families . Unaccompanied men go to the ancient relics at the rear of the train , where they are undisturbed unless their parties or fights tear up too much equipment . In September , the view from the highway bridge across the Kitimat River included most of the elements in the new community : an ugly construction housing camp at the right , a torn-up area straight ahead , and just the roofs of a few houses visible on the plateau at the left . In the center area , men swarmed in great confusion over the frame of a big department-store building , half finished , and an office building going up alongside . But in spite of the confusion , the plowed-up ground and the ugliness , it was possible to see the beginnings of the town the planners envisioned , Beyond the city center , in another raw clear-mg surrounded by the dog-hair forest which recently occupied all this flat , mud streets curved between half-finished houses , skeletal beginnings of houses and . foundations where houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Area C  --  it still has no better name  --  where 400 additional permanent homes should be ready this winter . In the autumn , contractors raced against the rains which would arrive with dreadful certainty in October and not let up  --  except to change to snow  --  until late spring . Nobody lived in Area C when 1 saw it , and it would not have set any homeseeker 's heart afire . But houses would be ready for winter , which could be important enough to make up for rawness and treelessness and the dreary business of living in the unfinished . But all this on the flat is Kitimat 's future . The present lies on top of the plateau just visible from the river bridge . Climbing to it is like changing civilizations . Only two of the ten plateau neighborhoods planned have been built thus far , but it 's hard to believe they 're only a couple of years away from the confusion on the valley floor . Here , 900 houses have been occupied , good schools operate , a supermarket and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and city departments proudly occupy a brand-new public-safety building , with a brand-new fire engine peeping from its station . Paved streets curve away from the traffic arteries , and wide lawns stretch between the schools , the stores and the residential blocks . In the late afternoon when I first saw it , the place was pulsating . Although Kitimat then had only seventeen miles of road , most of the 3000 automobiles in town  --  brought in by ship or train  --  competed for parking spaces around the supermarket . Covered walkways seethed with families , and a linguist could have had a wonderful time . Blond German boys in Lederhosen played heedlessly with a coaster wagon on the sidewalk while heavy Portuguese women walked around them , and Greek men , still with the sign of the smelter 's heat on their faces , talked with voices and hands . Austrian , Latvian and French women followed one another through the grocery lines , carefully counting out the unfamiliar Canadian coins . Coastal Indians sipped ice-cream sodas , and Hollanders and Czechs and Asians crowded a women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign-born , ranging all the way from skilled New Canadians commanding half a dozen languages , down to raw newcomers . Their presence makes for curiosities : pretty May Nelson , new fourth-grade teacher , not only faces the usual problems but must cope with a bright Italian child , assigned to the proper grade level but speaking no word of English . A nonplused high-school instructor faces , in addition to her expected pupils , half a dozen big , smiling Portuguese men who speak only a smattering of English . Night workers in the smelter 's hot fumes , they 've decided to make up for the high-school educations they missed in Portugal . Night classes in English draw 500 pupils , including both ramrod-stiff former German Wehrmachr officers and Baltic refugees from communism . Voters ' rolls remain small , because so many of Kitimat 's home buyers still are not Canadian citizens . All this is implicit in the supermarket crowds , but the net effect is normalcy , not strangeness . A visitor can select his street and imagine that he is in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously is planned , far more workable than most . If the visitor has previously looked ut artists ' conceptions of what the town should be , the effect of seeing it is astonishing : this is , to a surprising degree , just as the planners thought it would be . Half the city area is reserved for parks and recreation , Houses are similar , but monotony has been avoided by irregular spacing of identical houses and by minor variations in plan . Tree plantings , house additions , carports and play pens add individuality to every king-sized block . There still are n't many dogs and cats , and even fewer television aerials , but this is a young town , full of young people . So the prettiest house may wear , like a flag , the proof that even architects ca n't think of everything . In this case , they made insufficient provision for drying laundry indoors . The result is the flying burgess of the young married : diapers , row on row . I listened to a number of people : A. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the town only as a resident and because contented people simplify his employment problem ; Ken Brumley , Australian-born editor of the Northern Sentinel , a newspaper which was expected to lose money for five years , but already shows a profit and is considering daily publication ; mustache-decorated Cyril McC . Henderson , once city manager of Modesto , California , now working twelve or fourteen hours a day to make Kitimat , the city , as much as possible like Kitimat , the planners ' dream , and as soon as possible . Turney talked of plant expansions , Brumley of street improvements and a golf course . Henderson regretted that the town lacks independent capitalists to endow libraries or perpetuate their names by donating playground equipment . " But one of the things we need most , " he said , " we ca n't possibly have : some old houses and beat-up buildings . There ca n't be any marginal property for years , so there 's no place to start a boardinghouse or set up a fix-it shop . Where in this town could a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said the original investment in bridges , schools , civic buildings and sewers was so great that extra city financing had been essential . Bonded indebtedness already is $6,050,000 on an assessed valuation of $43,295,000$4,705,000 outside of the aluminum company 's stake  --  and 19.25 per cent of all revenues must go for debt service . Nevertheless , the 1956 program included seven miles of new paving , plus graveling , sanitary sewers and water mains . A city hall will soon be essential , although the public-safety building just opened . A restaurant operator admitted , oddly , " We could use another coffee shop or two , to take some of the pressure off this one . " Dr. William Windrim , a dentist fresh out of Baylor University , in Texas , said , " Through their real-estate people , the aluminum company made me a fine proposition , but I 've had to make about three times as big a bet on my own success as the average beginning dentist . With no service available , I could n't afford anything but the best equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dol lars a month before I have anything for myself . Other dentists tell me there 'll be no problem , but the investment scares me to death . " An aluminum-company executive ex-plained that thc minimum Kitimat house , with two bedrooms , costs about $15,000 , willmul garage . " This is the equivalent of an eleven-thousand-dollar house in Vancouver , " he admitted , " or a little more than that in the Western United States . " Of this , the home buyer can obtain approximately $10,500 on a National Housing Act loan  --  similar to FHA  --  and the aluminum company will take a second mortgage for all but $750 of the rest . Payments approximate $100 a month , but , through a bonus system , the company makes up thirty-five dollars of this for its own employees . Clear title is available , but the company guarantees the sale of the house of any worker who wishes to leave , with a depreciation allowance equivalent to a seventy-six-dollar monthly rental . However , all resales so far have been at cash profits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abide by strict building and zoning codes . Duplexes have been built , and some apartments are planned . Better and more expensive homes also have been built , and the town , although still in its bare feet , has the beginnings of a gold coast in one area . On one curving street I knocked at the first door . Answering was a middle-aged mother , five years out of England , two years in Kitimat . It was , she said , an interesting block : Hollanders across the street , Latvians , Germans , a Canadian family or two . " It 's a good town , " she said . " Nobody gets rich , but we 're happy enough . I only wish there were more for youngsters to do . No real play field yet , and nothing for teeners to do in the evenings . The trouble is , we have n't any bright lights , and the country around is too rugged . You do n't feel like letting them go hiking in these wild mountains , and you certainly do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a beautiful country , but there are n't even many places to walk . " The Hebers , from Amsterdam , found Kitimat better than they had expected , but prices in the store frightening . They were sure they 'd be happy wherever work was steady . Another young couple minded only the necessity of renting out part of their house  --  planners and city officials wink at this during the housing-shortage period  --  in order to meet expenses . Then there was the blonde , wiping great tears from her eyes as she contemptuously showed me through a " sky-liner , " one of the contractors ' houses with an unusual floor plan : all living quarters on the second floor , only utility space and a carport below . A company guide said , " People did n't care much for these houses until they spent a winter in them . But when the snow was six or seven feet deep , they were the only ones in town who really could see out of their windows . " Although the blonde had been in town a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no attempt had been made to clear out the movers ' litter . " Look at it ! " she said . " To think I left a good home and brought my children out to this ! Mud in the front yard , and the neighbors do n't even speak English . Do n't ask me about Kitimat , I 'm getting out just as fast as I can . If my husband stays here , it will be alone . The kids and I are going back home to the Prairies . " On another street , a skinny man fixed a child 's bicycle in a cluttered yard . " Some things all right , " he said in a heavy German voice , " but not all . I buy brand-new home . Now look ! Front steps crack where concrete no good . Nobody will do anything  --  not contractor , company , anybody . " He paused . " People tell you that everything under Nazis no good , " he said . " That 's not true . There were some bad things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a letter to that man  --  who was it , Hess ? ? and pretty soon they 'd have investigated about my steps . They would n't let this happen . " These are the people of Kitimat : the family which was n't too enthusiastic until they nearly froze on a visit back to England with its lack of central heating ; the onetime European tennis star now happy to be a smelter worker . teaching some tennis on the side : the musicians who organized a little symphony even before they had houses ; the former RAF and Luftwaffe pilots who trade cautious reminiscences in the beer hall : the wandering dishwasher , Fred Ryan , who saw opportunity in Kitimat , now owns a photo shop , a boat-rental business and other enterprises ; the lonesome men who haunt the post offices , waiting for grades in their correspondence course in English , radio repair or accounting . Company men frankly are pleased that the city , so far , has approximated the planners ' ideas . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police find their problems daily more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction camps . The school district now has less trouble in recruiting teachers , although classes continue to multiply and 1000 pupils now are enrolled . City manager Henderson says , " Our big problem is overselling . If we could just convince husbands not to oversell the place to their wives in advance , things would be much better . 1 tell prospective employees that it rains practically all the time , there 's nothing to do in the evenings and they 'll have to live in mud and uproar . So they 're pleasantly surprisedwhen they see Kitimat . But between what husbands tell wives and what they read , too many women come here expecting paradise . If they hit town in the rainy season and are led to some unfinished house with a sea of mud for a front yard , the shock can be nearly fatal . This is a workingman 's town  --  a good one , we think , but not a fancy suburb . The people who want it to be more than it is have to do it themselves . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " There 's the crux of the problem , " he says . " They do n't want to do it themselves . So much has been done for them that they expect the town or the company to doeverything else . They complain about nothing for the kids to do , but they would n't think of organizing an athletic team or a hiking club without help . " He grinned . " I do n't imagine my views arc popular , but there 's another big difficulty . Here , nothing will do but the best . The company is basically responsible . They 're building on a long-term basis and their people think that way . That 's fine for a smelter , but where does it leave some young fellow who wants to get married , but only has a few hundred dollars and does n't want to go in debt ? He may only earn a dollar sixty-nine cents an hour ( the smelter 's basic wage ) but if he wants a house , he has to buy one thatcosts fifteen thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like an athletic field , but one to suit the planners would cost thousands of dollars . Just clearing a field and playing as best we can between the mud puddles is n't nearly good enough . " We need a swimming pool . We could dam up one of these creeks and make one , for a few hundred dollars . Ca n't do that either . We have to wait until we can afford something better than anybody else has . So in the meantime , people who want to go swimming or play soccer are out of luck . It 's the great drawback to planning  --  people are n't as nearly perfect as the plans . "
