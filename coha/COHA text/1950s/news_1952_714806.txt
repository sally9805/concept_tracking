txt Desperate efforts to arrive at some ' sort of compromise between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic party seemed to be making headway yesterday . The tug-of-war between.the two factions had threatened to split the organization again , as it did in 1948 ; and the danger is not yet past . With the Harriman contingent in the vanguard , the Northern Democrats have been showing every evidence of a determination to re-create the party in their own image , and the adoption in the early hours of yesterday morning of a " loyalty " pledge for all delegates marked a long step in this direction . Many Northern Democrats believe that recent history , shows that the South is not necessary to Democratic success in Presidential years ; and they would have the Democratic party stand four-square on a Truman civil-rights program at the risk of Southern defection rather than compromise on this deep-seated issue . But other leaders of the party  --  including some from the North  --  obviously do not feel that way and their counsels apparently were prevailing yesterday . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as adopted should be literally enforced , a number of Southern delegations either would have to decline to participate in the convention or would have to be thrown out . But last night a compromise appeared to be found which would permit the " loyalty test " to be waived in the case of delegates whose state laws or Democratic bodies prohibited them from taking such an oath . If this solution holds up and the spirit of compromise really is abroad at Chicago , ** is just one potential nominee who will benefit from that development . He is , of course , Governor Stevenson . For Mr. Harriman represents the " all or nothing " school of'Northern Democrats who promoted the " loyalty " test and who sincerely believe that the Democratic party should represent a 100 per cent New Deal-Fair Deal program . Senator Kefauver has found himself allied with the Harriman wing in the " loyalty " pledge maneuverings . Senator Russell represents the opposite extreme . Senator Kerr has never had any real strength and Vice President Barkley has now retired from the field . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are very much in the stable , and the doors are still locked . Somehow Governor Stevenson is the one Democratic candidate ( if he can properly be called a Candidate ) who has managed to retain the admiration of the Northern liberals without alienating the Southern conservatives . If the party wishes to hold together its disparate elements  --  and succeeds in doing so at the convention  --  Governor Stevenson seems to be the logical choice . That large numbers of delegates instinctively feel this is self-evident . And the belief that Governor Stevenson is the Democrat who has the best chance of defeating General Eisenhower is no deterrent to his popularity . Even if the Democrats do unite on a nominee for whom all factions of the party can campaign with enthusiasm , , the Democratic party itself will not necessarily be united . The split is wide and deep , and probably incurable . The reasons for the conflict between Northern and Southern wings remain , and they can not be glossed over . It may yet ; come about that 1952 will see the   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
