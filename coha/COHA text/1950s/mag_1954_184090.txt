The year after he came down to London from Oxford 's Magdalen College , Kenneth Tynan wrote : " I work on the assumption that I 'll be dead at 30 . That gives me eight years to do all the things I want to do . " Tynan was determined " to become Britain 's first postwar myth . " <P> The road to mythology in Tynan 's case was paved , perhaps improbably , with theater reviews . But he succeeded magnificently . Now 27 , and with a full three years of life left , he has already written three books ( on the theater and its personalities ) , moved from Lord Beaverbrook 's Evening Standard ( which called him " the greatest theater critic since Shaw " ) to the tabloid Daily Sketch ( which billed him as " the liveliest writer of the day " ) . In August , Tynan becomes drama critic for the Sunday Observer ( circ. 475,609 ) , roughly the equivalent of the New York Times job now held by Brooks Atkinson . <P> Nakedly Plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goad , lacerate , raise whirlwinds . " He carries out the rules with a vengeance , writing in a rich , sometimes overripe style ( " My stylistic father is Horizon , my mother Vogue " ) . " With men who know rococo best , " says one of his more cynical American admirers , " it 's Tynan two to one . " He has an unerring eye for the sorest point , whether it be an actress ' weight or her unpleasing hands . After seeing Britain 's venerated Dame Edith Evans play Shakespeare 's Cleopatra , he wrote : " Bereft of fan , lace and sedan chair , Dame Edith is nakedly middle-aged and plain . " <P> Tynan 's enthusiasms are as strong as his dislikes . Recently , after he met Greta Garbo for the first time , he wrote : " What , when drunk , one sees in other women , one sees in Garbo sober . " Tynan sees little to respect in fellow reviewers . Drama critics , he wrote , can be divided into two groups : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other the starved , fasting mockers . They are drawn from the long and once respectable ranks of the nearly brilliant and they address themselves . . . to the suburban fortresses of semi-culture . " <P> Critic Tynan has made sure that no one could ever say that about him . Pale and lanky ( " He has the sort of face you would expect to see reflected in a spoon , " says one acquaintance ) , he often dresses in flowered waistcoats and velvet-lapeled jackets with turned-back Edwardian cuffs , and a mink necktie . " It looks like a raccoon at my jugular , " says Tynan . " People ask me , ' Who 's your friend ? ' " At home , with his two-year-old daughter and his American-born wife Elaine Dundy , he sometimes wears leopard-skin pants . <P> <P> Neither Tynan 's dress nor his outrageous posturing is any accident . Born in Birmingham , the son of a merchant , he went up to Oxford at 18 , well aware that " anyone who wants to play an eccentric to that crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is just what Kenneth Tynan bloody well did .
