India last week heard for the first time the full story of Constable Karam Singh . A stocky , moon-faced Sikh with a curly black mustache , Karam Singh . 49 , was the commander of the Indian police patrol in Ladakh that was ambushed and cut to pieces by the Chinese last October ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) . Captured , Singh was treated with a mixture of brutality , buffoonery , cynicism and dishonesty , which indicates that Chinese methods with their prisoners have varied little since the Korean war . <P> After a skirmish of several hours in which nine Indians died , Karam Singh and eight other policemen surrendered . Disarmed and searched , the Indians were ordered to carry the body of the one Chinese soldier who had been killed , as well as a wounded Indian constable named Makhan Lai . After a short march , the Chinese guards insisted that Constable Lai be abandoned on a river bank . He has not been seen since . <P> Into the Pit . Six hours and several miles later , the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 16,000 ft. above sea level . The prisoners were herded into a 6-by-7-by-15 ft. pit normally used for storing vegetables , and covered with a tarpaulin through which whistled the bone-cracking Himalayan wind . For food there was only dry bread ; they were refused water or permission to leave the pit to relieve themselves . <P> Karam Singh 's marathon interrogation began at 4 in the morning . He was asked to narrate the entire incident , but when he came to the point where the Chinese ambushers opened fire , the senior officer present " became wild and shouted back that it was incorrect , and that I must confess the Indians fired first . " Singh at first refused . The Chinese threatened to shoot him , and " ultimately , they made me say that I could not judge at that time as to who fired first . " After twelve hours of nearly continuous questioning , Karam Singh " was almost frozen and mentally and physically exhausted because of cold , persistent interrogation , intimidation , threats and angry shoutings , and the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the statement recorded by the Chinese . " <P> Allowed to sleep in an " unbearably " cold tent with insufficient blankets , Singh was awakened for another interrogation of 9 hours and told he would not get adequate shelter until the examination was concluded to Chinese satisfaction . With this stimulus to speed and agreement , Singh gave precise details of the arms , function and organization of India 's border patrols , his own operations prior to the ambush , and the location of Indian check posts throughout Ladakh . As a reward , he got some padded cotton clothing , which did not fit . At this point the Chinese set out to rewrite history by re-enacting it to suit the Chinese version . <P> The Reenactment . A cameraman arrived at the outpost , and the prisoners were twice taken to the scene of the fight for propaganda films . Once , said Singh , " I was given a handkerchief and asked to wave it as if to give a signal to the men to open fire . " The second time , the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between making statements and signing them , the prisoners were taken from their pit into the sunlight , served watermelon , and lectured on " Sino-Indian friendship . "
