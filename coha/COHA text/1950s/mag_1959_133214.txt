It has become part of our national idiom in the last few years  --  and it may currently be an international habit , though I would n't know that  --  to declare at the conclusion of some annual event that this year 's version topped all others that went before . If it was n't simply " the best , " it was at least " the most thrilling " or " the most spectacular " or the most something in one direction or another , as if to claim anything less were to admit that a retrogression had set in. // By the very nature of sports , the latest running of a good event can not invariably be an improvement on its predecessors . I have never understood why it was n't satisfying enough to say , for instance , that the 1959 Masters was enormously exciting , what with Art Wall 's incredible finish , without having to imply that it surpassed in excitement the 1954 Masters , in which Patton all but upset the applecart , or the 1935 Masters , which Sarazen won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upbeat that you end by losing the beat . // I mention this because in Melbourne after the recent Canada Cup match it was almost de rigueur for the visiting professional praise singers to allude to it automatically as the best Canada Cup ever . I do n't know whether it was or was n't , recalling the dramatic virtues of entirely dissimilar character which made the editions at Wentworth in 1956 and Tokyo in 1957 something to remember . However , this recent match held at the Royal Melbourne Club was an awfully good one , and staged as it was in a country which loves and lives sports with a passion that in several respects goes far beyond ours , it was loaded with some wonderfully interesting aspects and touches that could not be introduced in last week 's report , and I would like to tell you something about them now . // To begin with , a minimum of 10,000 spectators were on hand daily , and all of us were indeed impressed by the behavior of these large crowds and the tactful efficiency of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American and British tournaments nowadays , each hole is completely roped off from tee through the green , a very good system in that it allows more people to see what is going on than was possible under the old method when the horde raced down the fairway to fight for position to watch the next series of shots , there to be met by a squad of panting marshals hurrying to link up their bamboo poles or their ropes . At the same time , the old method had one advantage : the spectators could get up much closer on the approach shots and be standing relatively behind the line of the ball as it flew toward the pin , the best vantage for appreciating the quality of a golf shot . // At Royal Melbourne , since the fairways could take it , a combination of both systems was used . The fairways were roped off , but after the drives the gallery was permitted to surge onto them and watch the second shots from behind a new control line the marshals created by unhooking a long segment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to form a cordon across the width of the fairway . After each foursome had played its approaches , the two segments of rope were swung back and the unbroken perimeter restored . // The first morning of the tournament I was a member of the small army that went out to follow the Australian team of Thomson and Nagle , who were paired that day with the defending champions , Bradshaw and O'Connor of Ireland . On the fourth hole O'Connor hooked his drive into the young wilderness of tea trees off to the left . Down the fairway the ropes were swung out , all of us moved up to them and O'Connor with a mournful expression disappeared into the shrubbery . I had earlier been impressed by the consideration the spectators had shown each other  --  no pushing , no hard looks , everyone unaffectedly cooperative , which , from the little I have seen , is the code of the Australian as well as of Tristram Shandy 's Uncle Toby : surely there is enough room for all of us . Now it was that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien corn , O'Connor was trying to make up his mind whether to play a safe shot out laterally or to risk going for the green , and the crowd was surging forward with curiosity when the marshal addressed us . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he said in a tone with which I have never been spoken to before in my life by a marshal , " Ladies and gentlemen , can you please hold it a tick while Mr. O'Connor decides what he wants to do . " I was quite stunned by this civility and thought it was just one of those occasional lapses officials make , but before the day was over I realized it was the rule and not the exception . Late in the afternoon , for example , I joined the throng encircling the 18th green as Middlecoff and Snead were finishing . The Americans and their playing partners were about 20 paces from the green when an official voice sang out softly over the P.A. system . " Ladies and gentlemen , " the voice said , " may I remind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence is requested when the players are putting . And those cameras , save them for another day , will you ? " // You should not jump to the conclusion that because this patient politeness was rampant at Royal Melbourne there is anything svelte or " refained " about Australian golf galleries that would lead one to mistake them for the folks who perform the Ascot Gavotte number in My Fair Lady . The average Australian is a working bloke . He was out to see Sammy Snead  --  it was always Sammy  --  and the other stars , and when he was n't working hard studying the golfers he was working hard eating and fortifying himself for another go with the galleries . // The food facilities , by the way , were very good indeed . If you wanted to play it conservatively , you could stick to Coca-Cola and an Australian hot dog , which is served with catsup . Most of the fans seemed to prefer beer and hot meat pies ( which also come , requested or not , with a couple of shots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleries know their golf , too . Usually , all Snead has to do to arouse a chorus of open-mouthed " ohs " and " wows " and " whees " is to hit a tee shot . Here it was different . He had to hit a good tee shot , or the air was rent with silence . On the morning of the third day , for example , the Americans and South Africans were paired together . After the introductions on the first tee by Frank Pace , the head of the International Golf Association which sponsors the Canada Cup , Cary Middlecoff stepped up to drive . He belted a long one but it was pushed a bit . Not a single handclap . Snead , up next , coiled and uncoiled into his beautiful swing and powdered one that had a bit too much draw on it . Not a single handclap . The gallery was not being reserved . They simply did n't want to insult a man by feigning to admire a shot they knew he knew was not up to his best standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hit one that was straight down the middle all the way , the applause was instant . // The Canada Cup being the first big international golf tourney ever held in Australia , it was given frontpage coverage in the Melbourne papers  --  with a population of over a million and a half , this is no sleepy , country town  --  as well as extraordinarily complete television coverage . On Saturday , the last day , a full six hours of the play was telecast . I would n't want this to get around , it being a contradiction in terms for a golf reporter to be at a course and stay in the clubhouse , but on Saturday , with the temperature over 90 and 10,000 people tramping along in Thomson 's and Nagle 's gallery , it seemed the better part of valor to watch part of the proceedings over the TV set in the cool clubhouse bar . While it can hardly be termed a shock to discover that other countries televise golf better than we do , here the measure of superiority is large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in its flight and stay with it all the way . The commentators were un-showy and well informed , with the glaring exception of one member of the team who , reporting the play on the 15th , misidentified the players and confused the action with such unfailing regularity that he might have served his apprenticeship studying the telecasts of the Crosby. // As for the golf itself , the Canada Cup , from its second meeting in 1954 when 25 nations sent teams , has really been two events in one . First , you have the tournament proper . For all intents and purposes , this is a contest between the teams from the traditional golf-playing nations : United States , England , Scotland , Wales , Ireland , Canada , South Africa and Australia . No one else has a glimmer of a chance in the scoring competition except possibly the Argentines , the surprising Japanese and the Spanish team of the two Miguel brothers , Angel and Sebastian . Secondly , it is an assembly of golfers from all parts of the world , from nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect , one of the best things about this year 's match was the presence of the two poorest golfers who have ever taken part in the Canada Cup  --  Salim and Sjamsudin from Indonesia , a newcomer to the affair . These two pleasant , brown-skinned young men arrived in Australia with trousers that curled under their shoes , a minimum of English and four beat-up sticks apiece . They were outfitted with full sets  --  they never did get used to the wedge and went back to the seven-iron for their trap shots  --  and nervously set forth onto a course 10 times tougher than any they had seen before . They did n't do too badly at all . On the third round , Sjamsudin , a professional caddie at the Palembang Club in Sumatra and the best native player on the island , had an 87 , a feat comparable to Thomson 's breaking 70 . He slid back into the 90s on the last round , but his partner Salim brought in an 87 , which delighted everyone since it was the first time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salim is the best player among the professional caddies at the Djakarta Club in Java . He has his name tattooed on his arm . Sjamsudin has four gold teeth . They use an open stance on all shots , do not interlock or overlap the hands and swing too quickly , but they have a good instinctive ability for hitting golf balls . For all their jitters , their sole regret was that because they were playing they could n't get to study the techniques of the stars as much as they would have liked . It is to be hoped that in the years ahead we will be seeing other fellows like them from other countries where golf is hardly known and barely played , for these are the boys who make the Canada Cup more than just another 72-hole tournament . // On the eve of the match there was some speculation as to how welcome the galleries would make the Japanese team . The Australians , for understandable reasons , have been slower than some others at forgetting the war . As it turned out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero of the 1957 match , who was teamed not with his old partner , Ono , but with a country boy from the Nikko District , Haruyoshi Kobari , a pretty good scrambler . They did well for three rounds , but on the final day Nakamura took a 78 and Kobari a big 84 and they slipped from seventh to 13th in the standings . // Nakamura , you may be interested to know , has done very well commercially since his Canada Cup performance at Kasumigaseki elevated him to the status of a national personality . He has a new home . Where he used to get around on an old motor bike , now he drives a new Austin . An instruction book of his has been a big seller . He has become the complete pro , too , in shifting to much stronger , stiffer shafts and pursuing length , length , length . He now hits his drives 20 yards farther than two years ago but about 20 yards wider also , and he is no longer the best player in the Far East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-boned , lithe Chinese from the Taiwan Country Club who carried off the last Japan Open . Chen has a lovely , sound swing and is altogether an extremely fine golfer . After an opening 76 at Melbourne , he shot rounds of 73 , 71 , 72 and finished tied for sixth in the individual scoring with such slightly better-known names as Eric Brown of Scotland , Flory Van Donck of Belgium and Dr. Cary Middlecoff. // This mention of the individual scores leads me to the one serious criticism I have to make of the Canada Cup . The essential element that made the match attractive at the outset and continued to make it worthwhile is its being a team competition between nations . On every hole the scores of both members of the two-man teams count . That is why Nagle and Thomson went so far as to attempt to drive to the same sector of the fairway and to play their approaches to the same side of the pins , for then the second man to play the approach or putt could profit from his partner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my considered feeling that it was a shortsighted day when the IGA elected to put up a second trophy for the lowest individual total for the 72 holes . This has served only to detract from the team match . It generally will . On the final day , barring a complete collapse by the leaders or a galvanic rally by a contender , the outcome of the team match may be all but decided after the first nine holes . More often than not , though , the fight for individual honors will still be going on . Three times in the last five years , as a matter of fact , ties have resulted in this individual race , and sudden-death playoffs have been necessary . This has added a fillip of excitement , yes , but at the cost of taking away the spotlight from the team competition at the very moment of the tournament 's climax . // The heroes should be the men on the winning team . Many other observers besides myself hope that by the time the next Canada Cup is played at Portmarnock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format . As for the John Jay Hopkins Trophy that has annually gone to the low scorer , we see it serving a far better purpose if a competition within the over-all competition were set up for the new-to-golf nations , with this cup going to the winning team . Just how this could work is something that will take some thought , and we will be giving it precisely that this evening when we coast into Young and Jackson 's famous pub , order " a glass " and at a safe distance watch the celebrated 6 o'clock rush .
