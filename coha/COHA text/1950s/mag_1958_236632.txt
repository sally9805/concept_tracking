In Padang , at the foot of Sumatra 's towering Barisan Mountains , 40,000 troops and civilians gathered on a balmy tropical night last week to hear Lieut . Colonel Ahmad Husein proclaim a " revolutionary government with full sovereignty over all Indonesia . " Designated Premier of the new state was Sjafruddin Prawiranegara , ex-Governor of the Bank of Indonesia and a bitter personal enemy of President Sukarno . Cried Sjafruddin : " It is with deep sorrow and sadness that we are compelled to raise the banner of challenge against our own head of state . We have talked and talked . Now we must act . " <P> So the new Republic of Indonesia got its first major rebellion , and seldom had the world seen such a reluctant one . For months the rebel colonels had debated and threatened . Early last week they issued their oft-promised and oft-postponed ultimatum . It gave Djakarta five days to replace Premier Djuanda and his Cabinet by a new government free of Communist influence and headed by moderate ex-Vice President Mohammed Hatta and the popular , middle-of-the-road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was swift : it ordered the dishonorable discharge and immediate arrest of Colonels Husein , Lubis , Djambek and Simbolon , sent two B-25 bombers over Padang to spray the city with leaflets announcing the colonels ' dismissal for " endangering the security of the state . " <P> " Be Our Leader ! " In Padang the rebel colonels were unintimidated by Djakarta 's maneuvers , and as the week wore on they found some encouragement in reading news reports on Secretary of State Dulles ' press conference in Washington. * To 10,000 cheering students . Colonel Ahmad Husein cried that he was submitting his military rank to the will of the people . Pulling off his epaulets , he flung them into the crowd . With equal sense of theater , the students shouted , " No. no , be our leader ! " , and several of them hurriedly fastened the insignia back on Husein 's uniform with the cry of " Recommissioned by the people ! ' ' Troops and field-grade officers lined up to pledge loyalty to the rebels . As the ultimatum 's deadline approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts were spotted throughout Padang , armored cars patrolled the streets , a heavy guard was thrown about the residence of every colonel . <P> During the week 's uproar . President Sukarno seemed the most relaxed Indonesian . In Tokyo , on the last leg of a jaunt through Asia , he went with his staff to a geisha party at the Tskuki No lye ( House of the Moon ) and renewed a fond acquaintance with a pretty , 29-year-old geisha named Keiko Isozaki , whom he had known during World War II in the Japanese-occupied Celebes where she was entertaining the Japanese troops and he was a Japanese supporter . Next day , Sukarno 's Imperial Hotel suite had a hospital hush until late in the afternoon . Explained a wan Indonesian aide : " It was a very excellent party , but now I do not feel so well . " Geisha Isozaki tripped merrily off to a fashionable shop on the Ginza and bought Sukarno a 24-karat gold ear-cleaner inscribed with his name-the sort of gift that , in Japan , is made only to intimates. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
