" Cosmic rays , " said Professor H. V. Neher of Caltech , " have for years been regarded as a means of justifying travel to remote areas of the world . " Dr. Neher 's latest ray-hunting junket was to one of the world 's least seductive places , the North Magnetic Pole in barren arctic Canada . Last week he told a Pasadena meeting of the American Physical Society about the results of the trip . <P> No one knows yet where cosmic ray particles come from . A few may originate in rare solar " flares , " but most of them come from farther space . The fastest particles pack an enormous punch , up to 1016 ev ( 10 million billion electron volts ) of energy . To accelerate a flea to this speed , said Neher , would require all the energy released by a hydrogen bomb . <P> Magnetic Chimney . The more powerful particles have their scientific uses , but they travel so fast that they pay scant attention to most forces acting upon them . Others are so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their course and out into space again . The only place where the weak particles can reach the atmosphere unhampered is above the magnetic poles . <P> At this point the earth 's field points directly downward and therefore has no deflecting effect on the incoming particles . In Canada last summer , Dr. <P> Neher 's party launched balloons that counted the particles at 95,000 feet as they plunged down the polar " chimney . " The same thing had been done before , in 1951 , without notable findings . On this occasion , the scientists found in the chimney no particles with energy so low that it would not carry them safely through the stronger parts of the earth 's field . <P> On the latest expedition , results were different . There were more cosmic rays , and among them were feeble particles with only 150 mev ( 150 million electron volts ) . <P> If they had not hit the magnetic chimney , they would never have been caught by balloon-borne instruments . <P> Solar Clouds . What had changed since 1951 ? For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased its " activity , " shooting out less gaseous matter than it did a few years before . He believes that this thin stuff , mostly hydrogen , drifts in enormous , tenuous clouds through the solar system . Each cloud carries its own magnetic field , and when the clouds are numerous , they fill the solar system with magnetic obstacles in the path of the cosmic rays . The weak ones can not make the grade . They curve off into space and never reach the inner region where the earth revolves . <P> This was what happened in 1951 when the sun was active . Last summer the sun was in a quiet mood . The clouds in space had dissipated , allowing the weak particles to approach the earth . Most of them were chased away by the earth 's magnetic field , but a few hit the magnetic chimney and reached a close-in altitude where the scientist 's instruments could catch and count them .
