Now that it had its independence and was free of the stigma of imperial control , the newborn Federation of Malaya decided to try its own hand at bringing an end to the costly nine-year-old jungle war against Communist guerrillas . It issued a " new and final " amnesty offer to the 1,800 terrorists ( down from 8,000 ) still left and , just to make sure everyone gets the message , will drop no less than 12 million leaflets from R.A.F. planes . Terms : no persecution of terrorists who surrender , regardless of their past crimes ; restoration of civil rights to those who forswear Communism ; free repatriation to Red China of those who do not . The offer holds good until Dec. 31 , and after that the war will be pursued " with increased vigor . " <P> To make the point of its independence , the new government quoted from congratulatory messages from all over the world , including North Viet Nam 's Communist Boss Ho Chi Minh and Red China 's Mao . But Communist Chieftain Chin Peng , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not likely to be deceived by such diplomatic niceties . Radio Peking made the Communist position all too clear : " The Malayan people 's struggle against imperialism has not ended . "
