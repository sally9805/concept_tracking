As the summer season closed , museums and communities began dismantling the huge group shows , designed to satisfy tourists and help artists , that have become customary across the land . In size , the shows had often been barbaric . Visitors strolled through the exhibitions as if in a forest , ignoring the fact that any painting or sculpture worth seeing at all requires long contemplation . <P> The summer shows pointed up the fact that abstraction reigns supreme in the hearts of the nation 's young artists . To make a great abstraction is difficult-perhaps even impossible . But passably assured and decorative examples are fairly easy to produce , and juries-under the spell of trend and times-tend to award them their prizes . The jury at Chicago 's Art Institute gave Richard Talaber , 26 , the top prize for just such a picture .

But the public has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in a work of art ; the average layman sees content . At Boston 's Festival , viewers voted overwhelmingly for Gardner Cox 's Robert Frost . Cox 's portrait might be a bit fuzzy , but the subject had nobility , and that proved enough .
