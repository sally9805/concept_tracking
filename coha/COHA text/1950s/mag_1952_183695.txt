Like most campaigns , the 1952 presidential campaign began with polite debate and an implied treaty of mutual respect . Last week the air waves crackled with television scowls and such words as " bigotry " , " fraud " , and " lies . " In its climax , the 1952 campaign was a strident and bitter conflict . <P> The conflict was the most predictable result of all . The three months of campaigning were part of a crisis in U.S. history , part of a deep struggle to align the U.S. with the responsibilities , opportunities and dangers of the newest phase of its existence-world leadership in the cold war with Communism . The presidential election would be a fraud itself if it did not somehow reflect this conflict . <P> The struggle was mirrored in millions of individual voters whom the pollsters classified as " undecided . " Their indecision was not necessarily based on a supposition that the two parties had fought to a draw on the issues . Rather , one party had made headway on one set of issues , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which set will most influence the voters . <P> The Republicans have made headway with their case that Ike Eisenhower is better equipped to deal with the Korean war , the Russians and the problem of Communists in Government . The Democrats have made headway with their case that the party of Franklin Roosevelt , <P> Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson is more likely to be economically good for the individual . <P> " By well over 2-1 , " reported Pollster Elmo Roper this week , " voters feel that they personally would have been worse off financially had the Republicans been in office during the last 20 years . By an identical margin they think they will be better off under the Democrats in the next four years . " <P> On the other hand , Roper found that two-thirds of the U.S. deplore the Korean war stalemate . By a 3-1 count , this group thinks Eisenhower can solve the problem better than his opponent . " Of all the issues , " Roper wrote , " Korea is clearly Eisenhower 's strongest asset . " Half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that it is a crucial problem for the next administration . Of these , most ( 3-1 ) think the Republicans can best handle it . <P> On the periphery , corruption in Government is a less important issue than it started out to be ( but a majority of those who are worried about it doubt that Stevenson could clean it up ) . The high cost of living has crept into kitchen doors while big paychecks march in the front : the pollsters think many a housewife is ready to vote Republican to hold down prices and that a larger proportion of women than men will vote for Dwight Eisenhower .
