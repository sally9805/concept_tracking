When the U.S. Air Force won its independence in 1947 , it was practically inevitable that there should be an independent Air Academy too . But so many proposals and counterproposals poured in that the Air Force began looking for a topflight general to spearhead the whole project . Last week the man who more than any other made the Air Academy possible got his just reward . When the academy opens its doors to its first 300 cadets next year , it will have as its first superintendent Lieut . General Hubert R. Harmon , 62 . <P> A West Pointer ( class of ' 15 ) , " Doodle " Harmon comes from a distinguished family of soldiers . His father was the commandant of cadets at what is now the Pennsylvania Military College , and one of his brothers was Lieut . General Millard Fillmore Harmon , who , as wartime commander of the Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific , was lost at sea in 1945 . In World War I , young Doodle served as an aviator in France ; in World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . Later he served as senior Air Force member on the U.N . ' s Military and Naval Staff Committee ; in 1949 he was given the job of coordinating plans for the new academy . With an earnest but easygoing diplomacy , he whittled down the bewildering array of blueprints , picked an able committee of civilians and airmen ( among them : Charles A. Lindbergh , General Carl Spaatz ) to choose a site . Finally , in 1953 , having retired to San Antonio , General Harmon was summoned back to help push the whole project through Congress . <P> Gaunt , genial Doodle Harmon likes to pretend that his chief qualification for his new job is his " unprejudiced ignorance " about education . But in reality , he has already gone far with his plans for the academy 's curriculum . On the technical side , cadets will start off with two months of indoctrination in everything from military drill to servicing aircraft . After that will come a three-year aircraft observer 's course ( 355 hours on the ground , 171 in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombardiers . In their last year , the cadets will finally start training as pilots . But for General Harmon , all this is only a part of what the academy will do . A sample of his plans : <P> To place greater emphasis on the liberal arts than either West Point or Annapolis-3,177 hours of the sciences , social studies and the humanities , compared to 2,176 of " airmanship . " <P> To arrange such subjects as history and literature " horizontally , " so that while cadets are studying the history of ancient Greece , they will be studying its literature too . <P> To offer languages only in the last year , and only to students with a real aptitude and an obvious desire to learn . Instead of big doses of grammar and reading , the academy will concentrate on conversation and speech-on the theory that " the cadet may put his language to use immediately , for many will be sent directly to foreign lands .
