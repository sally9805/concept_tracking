Columbia University 's research ship Vema steamed back into New York Harbor last week with new information about the " rivers " that flow on the bottom of the ocean . About 600 miles east of Philadelphia , where the Atlantic is 17,000 ft. deep , the Vema 's sensitive sounding apparatus found a steep-walled canyon two or three miles wide and about 180 ft. deep . The scientists followed it for 100 miles and they have reason to believe that it may run for 500 miles across the bottom of the ocean ( see map ) . <P> This discovery was no surprise to Bruce C. Heezen of Lament Geological Observatory , the Vema 's scientific skipper . Two years ago , the Vema found another canyon south of Greenland , which it traced north and south for 1,200 miles on the bottom of the Atlantic . Heezen believes that there must be many such gorges and that they are the channels of mud rivers that formed the level plain on the ocean floor . <P> The bottoms of the deep oceans were once believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irregularities . Certain great areas , however , are almost as level as the water surface above them , and the origin of these smooth " abyssal plains " is something of a mystery . Many theories about them have been proposed , including the easy explanation that the plains are smooth because nothing ever happened to make them otherwise . <P> Heezen believes that they are the flood plains and deltas of " turbidity currents " : rivers of mud , heavier than clear water , that coursed intermittently down the slopes of the continents and deposited their sediment far out on the bottom of the ocean . Most of the sediment , he thinks , was carried down in remote geological ages . The turbidity currents probably started near land . They cut deep gorges ( e.g. , the famous Hudson Canyon ) in the continental slopes and dumped their silt and sand in deep basins in the irregular ocean bottom . When the nearest basin was full , the mud-river ran across it just as a river would do on dry land , and started to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia is probably cut in the sediment of a filled-up basin . <P> To prove this theory the Columbia scientists took cores of the material that forms the abyssal plains . They found what they hoped to find . On top is a thin layer of " lutite , " very fine silt deposited from still water . Below it is the coarse sand that was carried over the sea bottom for hundreds of miles by mighty under-ocean rivers .
