Is any form of press censorship needed now ? From two members of Harry Truman 's Cabinet , newsmen got two answers last week . <P> In Boston , Attorney General Howard McGrath told newsmen : " Newspapers enjoying unlimited freedom from Government interference can be , have been and are , some of them , vile and dishonorable : beyond all understanding . . . But under this Administration there will be no implied , no disguised , no direct and no indirect censorship . . . even if the tiny group of malcontents who traduce your Government from day to day were to increase and intensify their output twenty fold . " <P> But in Columbus , Ohio , Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer suggested to the Ohio Newspaper Association that some sort of voluntary censorship is necessary to prevent leaks of defense data . While he admitted that many leaks came from people in Washington who liked " seeing their names in the papers , " Sawyer thought the American Society of Newspaper Editors could work out a way of keeping such leaks out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a division in the Commerce Department to offer advice on what people could say or not say about industrial technical data without violating security . " This service , " he said airily , " . . . is designed to furnish a point in Government to which the patriotic citizen can turn when in doubt as to what he should or should not reveal . " <P> The anti-Truman New York Daily News thought there was something fishy about the preoccupation of two non-military Cabinet members with censorship problems . For fellow newsmen it had a warning : " Brace Yourselves , Gents . . . Evidently honest criticism is getting under Harry 's hide . . . Better close ranks right now , and get set for the next snide Administration attack on the freedom of the press . "
