It is a reasonable assumption that hardly an American thinks of automobiles when he thinks of Sweden . Garbo , yes . Bergman , to be sure . Cars , no ; for the Swedish auto industry is microscopic by American standards . // Well , last Saturday 10 Swedish cars  --  five Volvos and five Saabs  --  were entered in the 10-hour Little Le Mans race at Lime Rock Park , Conn. against an array of French , German , English and Italian cars . Not only did they all finish , they swept the first nine places and carried off the index of performance , or handicap , trophy . // The race , believed to be the first in the world of its kind , was originally scheduled for 12 hours , just half as long as the famous French endurance test after which it was named . It was shortened to 10 hours after the police objected to night racing . To fit it in between dawn and dusk the start was scheduled for 8 a.m. , and at 8 a.m. the thermometer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Thus it was that one driver , blind to the splendor of frost-covered hillsides and maples ablaze with autumn foliage , huddled miserably in a raccoon coat as he awaited the count-down for the Le Mans-style start . First away of the 31 entries was a Volvo , and then into the first corner went the field like a locust swarm , tiny engines wound up to unaccustomed racing speeds . // Around the 1 ? - mile road course sped Volvos and Saabs ; English-built Metropolitans ; French Renaults , Dyna Panhards and a Simca Aronde ; DKWs and Volkswagens from Germany ; English Austin A-35s and Morris 1,000s ; and a Fiat 600 from Italy  --  none with a piston displacement of more than 1,600 cc . For class awards the cars were grouped in three sections : those with a displacement of less than 750 cc , those between 750 and 1,200 cc. and those between 1,200 and 1,600 cc . At 1,597 cc. and 85 hp the Volvos were the largest and most powerful . Unsurprisingly , they soon took the lead as a unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Washington , D.C. 's Charles Kolb , had given them a stirring battle . A long pit stop to correct valve trouble sank the Simca. // As the sun burned the frost from the ground and the blue haze from the hills , the Volvos consolidated their lead . There developed a race-long duel between the No. 1 car of New Jersey 's Vernon Bennett and Ralph Schantz and the No. 5 machine of Arthur Riley of Port Washington , N.Y . and bearded Bill Rutan of Essex , Conn. // But no one could ignore the perky little three-cylinder , two-cycle , 748-cc . Saabs . From the first they were well placed on handicap and scrapping among the first 10 over-all . Fastest of the Saabs was the No. 55 , driven by Dick Thompson of Washington , D.C. and Emil Pupilidy of Freeport , N.Y. , both widely known sports car drivers . // " That car just keeps buzzing along like a little hornet , " said Thompson during a respite . // The Saabs buzzed fast enough to take the sixth through ninth places over-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bountifully prepared , the Saab men had brought 82 spare tires and wheels . As much could not be said for the lone Fiat , whose entrants , needing to replace a distributor , lifted one from a spectator 's unattended Fiat ( pleading urgency in a note left under the windshield wiper ) and sent the 600 back into the chase . // As for the Volvos , the Riley-Rutan car took over in the ninth hour and held the lead thereafter , completing 398 laps at an average of 59.646 mph for the 10 hours . Bennett and Schantz finished two laps behind ; the remaining Volvos took the next three places . A 950-cc . DKW , similar to the Saab in engine design and front wheel drive , was 10th over-all and first in the intermediate class . Only four cars retired , a tribute to the endurance qualities of the field . // Team Manager John Norwood had just time to say " tack sa mycket " to his Volvo drivers before night fell and visions of aquavit began dancing in their heads .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
