LIFE PLUS 99 YEARS ( 381 pp. ) - Nathan F.Leopold Jr. - Doubleday ( $5.50 ) . <P> <P> " I do n't want to think about those sordid things , " writes Nathan Leopold . He may have written this memoir partly to help ease his burden of guilt about " those things , " though the book reads less like a cathartic confession than the garrulous , sometimes querulous recollections of a man who had all the time in the world and seems to think that his audience has as much . <P> Before being paroled ( TIME , March 3 ) , Leopold served 33 years of his sentence ( life plus 99 years ) in Illinois prisons for his share in the " Crime of the Century . " His account of how he made the transition from front-page monster to model prisoner is pitiable , but it would need genius-which his friends seem to claim for him , and which he seems not to have - to make the story tragic . Such men as Leopold lead a strange existence-condemned to life , but forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned with details of prison existence-often , perhaps , most interesting to students of penology and the strength-through-pain principle behind it . There is the round of workshops , prison libraries , bouts in " solitary , " a pet bird named Bum , a kindly chaplain . <P> Food was good ; the " screws " ( guards ) were , within limits , kind , Nathan Leopold , 19 years old when he entered prison , did service as a malaria guinea pig . increased his knowledge of foreign languages to 27 , and acquired the elements of , or at least a desire for . religious faith . But readers may well feel that they never saw a man who looked so listlessly at the sky . Leopold shows the clear lapse of reason by which , like most lifers , he became a collector of injustices in a place where uncommon cruelty was a common failing . In short , Leopold can tell everything about prison except why he was there . <P> " That 'll Be a Snap . " The thrill murder of 14-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only account is left to Mystery Master Erie Stanley Gardner , who provides the book 's pompous introduction . Leopold begins his story hours after the deed , and this section is the most fascinating in the book . A few days after the murder , Leopold went out with his girl , and she read him Lamartine . There are other tantalizing and incongruous glimpses of Leopold 's cozy Chicago background . His family called him " Babe " ; his aunt was " Birdie " ; Richard Loeb 's mother was " Mompsie . " <P> Perhaps the weirdest thing about the book is the reconstructed conversations with Accomplice Dickie Loeb , who , in Leopold 's recollections , speaks a weirdly dated slang . It is with a kind of horror that the modern reader finds an appalling crime described in a debased Tom Swift idiom . Writes Leopold : " Dick was in high spirits . . . ' That 'll be a snap . Nate . Nothing to it . ' " Says Loeb to Leopold , as they are planning to collect ransom for Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm a poet ! " When headlines announce : BODY OF BOY FOUND IN SWAMP , Loeb asks : " What'cha think , Nate ? When are these damn papers printed ? " Leopold replies : " Hell , I do n't know . Couple of hours ago .
