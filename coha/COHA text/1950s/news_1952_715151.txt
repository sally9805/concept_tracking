txt CHURCHILL COMING TO SEE EISENHOWER ; ARRIVING ON JAN. 5 He Will Probably Meet General Next Day , Then Visit Truman Before Going to Jamaica MM CALLED EXPLORATORY1 Drafting of Rough Agenda for Later British-U . S. Parley on Wide Issues Is Indicated By RAYMOND DANIELL Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Dec. 26 From Chequers , where he spent Christmas , Prime Minister Churchill announced tonight that he would sail ! next Wednesday for the United States for talks with Presidentelect Dwight D. Eisenhower and President Truman . Mr. Churchill expects to reach ' New York on Jan. 5 and probably will see General Eisenhower the next day . He is to visit the White House Jan. 8 , leaving for Jamaica ) the next day after spending the night at the British Embassy . Traveling with him on the same ship will be Sir Roger Makins , the new British Ambassador to the United States . Suggestions that some sudden development in world affairs had prompted Mr. Churchill 's announcement were discounted when it was learned that he had first put forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States about ' ten days ago . It has been in his mind , it was said , ever since last November when General Eisenhower was elected . General Eisenhower said in New York Friday : " I heard that my old friend was coming , and I am delighted to meet him . " His comment was made public by a press aide at the Eisenhower headquarters in the Commodore Hotel . Not Standing* on Ceremony Ever since November , Mr. , Churchill has been toying with the idea that he and the commander of the Allied armies that liberated Europe might together give a new direction to world affairs . Many of his advisers have counseled him to make haste slowly and to wait for an invitation from the new President after his inauguration . It has been suggested that too precipitate a move on , Mr. Church- , ill 's part might seem like indecent haste and might even make General Eisenhower 's task more difficult by emphasizing his past role in Europe before he has had a chance of evincing his interest in the world as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister decided not to stand on ceremony and wait for an invitation but to go now  --  perhaps , as some suggested , to strike while the iron is hot  --  not so much seeking favors as contributing new ideas . Mr. Churchill will sail from Southampton on the Queen Mary . He will spend two or three days // in New York at the home of Bernard M. Baruch , after which he will go to Washington to pay , his respects to President Truman . Before returning here he will visit Jamaica for about a fortnight . The phraseology of the announcement of his journey , which came from 10 Downing Street , was interesting because the announcement was at such pains to make it appear that the purpose of his voyage was to spend a holiday in Jamaica and that his talks with General Eisenhower and President Truman were merely incidental . That theme was stressed in all the " guidance " to correspondents that accompanied the announcement . Text of the Announcement Here is the text of the announce-ment : " The Prime Minister is leaving by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight in Jamaica . " On the way he will stay two or three days in New York with Mr. Bernard M. Baruch . " He will meet Mr. Eisenhower during his visit for informal talks . " He will also visit Washington to pay his respects to President Truman . " In Jamaica a house has been placed at his disposal by Sir Harold Mitchell . He will visit the Governor , Sir Hugh Foot , at Kingston . " Mr. Churchill will be accompanied by his wife , his daughter , Mary , and her husband , Christopher Soames , Conservative M. P. They will make a family party rather than an official delegation from the British Government , it was explained . That will come ' later , it is hoped , in February or ( March , when Mr. Churchill , R , A. Butler , Chancellor of the Exchequer ; Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Defense Minister Earl ' Alexander are all hoping to go to the United States for talks with the new Administration covering the whole field of economics , world politics and strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States is exploratory and is designed partly , at least , to draft a rough agenda for the later meeting . The British Government is most anxious to prevent a broadening of the war in Korea and is eager to bring about a coordination of British and American policy in the Near East . It is felt here , too , that , there are developing problems in Southeast Asia that require Brit .. ' ish-American consultation as well as Britiain 's relationship to the Pacific alliance of the United States with Australia and New Zealand , ' from which this country has been excluded against its wishes . Hope for Close Tie Seen Close friends of Mr. Churchill ' have indicated that his feeling toward General Eisenhower is avuncular . The general 's election inspired in the head of Britain 's wartime coalition the hope , if not the belief , that a close personal relationship similar to that which existed between him and President Roosevelt could be renewed . Most London newspapers emphasized Mr , Churchill 's love for a holiday in the sun . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of New York and only incidentally would see the Presidentelect and the retiring President . The Liberal News Chronicle said in an editorial that Mr. Churchill had surprised everybody , but it was confident that his visit " will give great pleasure in the United States . " Immediately after General Ei senhower 's election Mr. Churchill sent " sincere and heartfelt congratulations " and said " I look forward to a renewal of our comradeship and of our work together for the same causes of peace and freedom as in the past . ' Until after his inauguration Jan. 20 , the same day as Parliament convenes again , General Eisenhower could not formally . invite Mr. Churchill to come to the United States but it seems apparent that Mr. Churchill would not have decided to go if he had not received a green light , however unofficially it may have been , blinked . On Dec. 11 , replying to a question in the House of Commons regarding his plans for establishing early contact with the new American Administration , Mr. Churchill declared that while the President-elect would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not neglect any opportunities that might occur for " private and in= formal discussions with the new Administration . " In a way Mr. Churchill 's visit to the United States might be compared with the contemplated visit of Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia to this country . As protocol decrees that no head of state may come here officially until after the coronation of Queen Elizabeth , some formula will have to ' be ' found to permit a social occasion from which both Marshal Tito and the British Government hope to profit . Mr. Churchill made his last visit ' to the United States early this year soon after his party was returned to power in the 1951 elec- , tion . He is an old friend of Mr. ' Baruch who has been his guest at Chartwell , the Prime Minister 's country home at Westerham , Kent . Sir Harold Mitchell , who has placed his Jamaika house at Mr. Churchill 's disposal , is a former Conservative member of Parliament who became a baronet in 1945.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
