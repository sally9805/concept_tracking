txt The constructive activities of the United Nations , President Truman reported to Congress yesterday , " have been overshadowed by the unsolved problems arising from the policies and acts of the Soviet Union which lead to tension and impairment of security in international relations . " For this reason , he indicated , he proposed to give in the report the " fuller attention " that these activities of the United Nations merit . This judgment is sound and the report is welcome on this score . The United Nations is concerned with much more than " disputes , " however much those controversies may command the headlines . Forward steps have been taken during the past year and they are going on . President Truman commented especially upon the support for his Point Four Program and that is important . To it must be added the work of Unesco , of the gains in the health organization , of the concern for children and for refugees , of the substantial advance in the concept of trusteeship , of the broad discussion of human rights and human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President mentioned Indonesia , Kashmir and Palestine . But the settlement of disputes is where the United Nations must begin , not where it should end . It is a team , not an umpire . Its objective is to score runs , not settle arguments . When that becomes clear the whole question of the attitude and actions of the Soviet Union can be seen in a different perspective . The President noted Soviet obstructionism on such questions as the control of atomic energy , armament limitations and peace treaties for Japan and Germany . He might well have gone further and have noted Soviet apathy toward almost all of the constructive phases of the United Nations ' work . The problem is not merely that the Soviet Union tries to prevent us from reaching a peace ; it makes no effort to contribute to gaining ground where peace obtains . The obstruction is not merely the positive use of the veto ; it is the negative use of the walkout , and even more important , the stayout . This has a bearing , in turn , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmittal . He called the Soviet boycott over the issue of Chinese representation a " willful flouting " of the obligations assumed under the United Nations Charter . That is entirely correct and is doubly significant at a time when many persons are confused by the belief that the United States is somehow impeding the United Nations because it does not recognize the Communist regime in China and support its membership in the United Nations . If President Truman can have set that record straight he will have done a public service . The United States is not prepared , at this time , to enter into diplomatic relations with the Chinese Communists . There is nothing on the record to indicate that such a course . is desirable . Indeed , if there were no other argument , the sorry spectacle of Britain now in receipt of further terms upon which she will receive the privilege of recognizing Peiping should make Americans wary , to say the least . We may consider the recognition of the Chinese Reds when they have given an inkling , not to say a demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted good behavior . No such intimation is in sight . Meanwhile , we have stated that we will abide by a majority decision in the United Nations . We have not threatened a veto . We have not walked out of anything , and it might be noted that we had a far larger number of cooperative enterprises that we could have deserted than did the Russians . We will uphold the United Nations Charter and will try to make the organization work . We will not try to , enforce our will and judgment by boycott and we will not get into tantrums and go home if we ca n't pitch . We still believe in the team . The President stated that " the United Nations seeks agreement and the execution in good faith of agreed undertakings . " We have acted in good faith and will continue to do so . The report on what we have done and what we have not been able to do should help to make that plain .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
