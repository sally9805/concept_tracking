Helen of Troy ( Warner ) . " Seven cities warred for Homer , being dead , wrote Thomas Hey wood , " who , living , had no roof to shroud his head . " Two other cities , Rome and Hollywood , which care more about the poet 's capacity to turn a profit than a phrase , have recently made an uneasy truce before the walls of Troystrictly , of course , for the sake of plunder . <P> Last year a Roman studio produced Ulysses , a $3,200,000 version of the Odyssey , but the title role was played by Hollywood Actor Kirk Douglas , and the picture was released in the U.S. by Paramount Pictures . The Iliad is now presented in a $6000,000 production in full color by Warner Bros. , but the picture has an Italian heroine , and was actually filmed in Rome 's big Cinecitta . In both cases , the blind poet , who wrote as well as any man for the mind 's eye , has been translated for the camera 's with all possible splendor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical ellipsis and a few brazen disfigurations ( it was Hector , not Paris , who killed Patroclus ) , the script by John Twist shows a commendable respect for the letter of the myth . It is the spirit that is Twisted . Homer 's was a mythic drama in which gods and heroes , love and politics , war and religion moiled in the mortar of imagination . Helen of Troy is basically a story of hot pants in high places . The hero , accordingly , is not " godlike Hector " or " great Achilles " but " soft Paris , " whom even Helen called a coward . As the part is written , the " pest of Troy " can actually fight like a Trojan , and , as it is played by Jacques Sernas , the " form divine " is so gorgeously muscular that everybody will understand why that prissy old maid , Athena , flew into such a snit about the boy . <P> As for about the Helen , Rossana Podest is a charming girl , but the customers like King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Is this the face that launched a thousand ships ? " And is this Hector ( Harry Andrews ) , dreadful in his wrath and fierce Achilles ( Stanley Baker ) , both with arms like lath ? They look , as on the field of Mars they clash , like aging brokers at a game of squash . They talk like brokers , too , except when the scriptwriter tries to belt out a Homer but winds up with a high-flown foul , e.g. , " Tell her she will walk in all my dreams . " <P> The film is most successful when transforms Homeric epithet into moving picture . The frontal assault on Troy is a grand sight- yet not so grand that the spectator wonders if he has not arrived for the Dardanelles campaign 3,000 years late . The chariot chases are breakneck things . Best of all , though , is the passage in which the colossal horse comes gliding into Troy on a churning revel , like the thought of death on the full flood of life . <P> The Lieutenant Wore Skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Year Itch . It may rub sensitive spectators the wrong way , but no matter . Whenever there is a possibility that the audience may get really sore , Actor Tom Ewell applies his soothing sense of humor .
