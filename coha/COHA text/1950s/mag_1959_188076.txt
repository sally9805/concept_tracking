Fidel Castro got around to the cold war last week-and declared himself a neutral . " Why choose sides ? " he asked a rally of 100,000 Havana workers . " Why say that all America must join one of the bands ? Why not proclaim our right to live ? " Castro 's neutralism was a forthright rebuff to the U.S. , but in expressing it he also slapped down one of his oldest supporters , ex-President Jos ( " Pepe " ) Figueres of Costa Rica , who sat near by as a guest of honor . <P> On a six-day visit to Cuba , Figueres had tried hard to fit into the revolutionary mood . He turned out in a baggy khaki uniform left over from his successful Costa Rican revolution of 1948 . He arrived early for the big workers ' parade in downtown Havana , sat dutifully on the speakers ' stand while the unions marched , did not flinch when a drizzle began and Castro ordered the stand 's striped tarpaulin ripped away , saying : " If the people get wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came at the microphone , Figueres recalled that " our group gave what modest aid it could to end tyranny in Cuba " ( notably a planeload of arms to Castro in his darkest days ) . Figueres went on to say that " in Latin America we ignore a little the possibility of a great conflagration , of a third World War . " He anxiously noted that in dealing with the U.S. " at times we speak in the language almost of warlike enemies . " He confessed " worry " about Communist influence in Latin America and warned against siding with the Soviets in the cold war . At this point , David Salvador , young chief of the Cuban Federation of Labor , grabbed the mike from Figueres ' hand and yelled : " Neither do we have to be on the side of America , which is trampling on us ! " Visibly shaken , Figueres got the microphone back and finished his speech in a tone more likely to please : " In the social battle , I believe in a constructive anti-imperialism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel my ideas at odds with those of our illustrious visitor . " In support of neutralism , he offered a flattering version of U.S. civil defense : " They have shelters against atomic attack ; we do not have even a miserable small hole in which to hide . Why not say these truths ? Why not say that Cuba has participated in all the wars and when the wars were over its sugar quota was taken away ? " * But Castro thought he knew how Figueres had gone wrong : he had been influenced by " a press campaign emanating from the monopoly of international news agencies . " <P> <P> * Cuba entered World War II , sent no troops overseas , supplied sugar to the U.S. and Allied forces . Its guaranteed quota of the U.S. sugar market remained in effect then and now .
