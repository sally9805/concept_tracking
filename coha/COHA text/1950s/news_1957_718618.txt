txt Letters to The Times Letters to The Times Raising Jobless Tax Hughes-Ashbery Bill Opposed as Penalizing Apparel Trades To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Hughes-Ashbery bill ( S. 1851 , A. 2185 ) snow before our Legislature would not only weaken our unemployment insurance system but would actually cause many workers to become unemployed . The opposition of both the garment workers and their employers centers on the bill 's proposal to increase the top payroll tax to 4 per cent and to effect this increase in such a way that the greatest tax burden would be placed on small employers generally and on the apparel trades in particular . Under the Hughes-Ashbery bill the 1958 tax load of some 6,700 employers in the apparel trades  --  most of whom are very small employers -- will- be $31 million higher than 1957 , an increase of 33 1/3 per cent . At the same time about 104,000 employers in other industries will be handed tax cuts of almost $121 , : 2 million . The ultimate burden of the Hughes-Ashbery tax device will be borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't pay wages  --  and the Hughes-Ashbery tax proposal is without any doubt going to mean more and more empty apparel factories in this state . It will give garment manufacturers a good dollars-and-cents reason for leaving New York State and moving to near-by states , all of which require a much lower tax than that proposed in the HughesAshbery bill . Level of Reserves The increase in tax rates can not be justified in terms of the solvency of the Unemployment Insurance Fund , which is now almost as high as it ever has been . Our reserve ratio is higher than the national average , higher than the average in the five leading industrial states . Nor can the proposed increase in taxes be justified as necessary to provide for the Hughes-Ashbery revisions of benefit rates and eligibility requirements , which involve an increase in expenditures of only slightly more than 1 per cent of the fund . Apparently the only justification for the increase in tax rates for the apparel trades is that since garment workers drew on the Unemployment Insurance Fund more than workers in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taxes . This argument is as wrong as it is simple . It assumes that the individual garment manufacturer is in some way responsible for the seasonal nature of his industry and that he should therefore be penalized for causing unemployment . But it takes only a moment 's reflection to recognize that no employer in the apparel trades is responsible for the change in seasons , for the change in women 's tastes , for the change in retailing practices  --  for all of the seasonal and cyclical changes which set the pattern of employment and unemployment not just for an indi-. vidual firm but for the entire industry . The Hughes-Ashbery proposal can not create regularity of employment . All it will succeed in doing is penalize garment employers for having set up business in New York State . Raising Rate Ceiling Moreover , it is quite clear that the Hughes-Ashbery tax bill is merely one in a series of steps designed to shift more and more of the tax burden on the apparel trades until they are driven out of this state . The very legislative leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes-Brees experience rating provision were passed , that there was no need for individual penalty rates above 2.7 , per cent are seeking to pierce this traditional ceiling and raise it to 4 per cent . Tomorrow they will no doubt propose a 5 per cent ceiling , and then a 6 per cent ceiling . A halt must be put on this very dangerous trend . For the sake of a small group of large employers in selected industries the Legislature is now being asked to impose a new tax which can only drive more women 's wear employers out of the state and throw upon the unemployment insurance and relief rolls thousands upon thousands of workers who have spent their lives in building up our state 's leading industry . In sum , while the Hughes-Ashbery bill does propose some slight improvements in benefit rates and in other respects , the bill is so deficient in very vital tax aspects that we strongly urge its defeat .

Volunteer Libraiy for Children To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : In. her letter published March 4 Mrs. Cahn has made a very important point concerning the need for greater community initiative in providing more and better books for the growing generation . At the risk of seeming to blow our own trumpet , I want to report briefly the experience of one community volunteer li . Ibrary in Manhattan . The Morningside Junior Library was opened just over a year ago , at 13 Claremont Avenue , to meet the Ireading needs of the children from kindergarten through high school . It now has 3,600 books on its shelves , most of them donated . All services are rendered without charge by some forty-five mothers working on a strict schedule . The library has about 220. family memberships , at $3 each , representing a total of some 500 children .

Compensating- Shopkeepers Role of Individual in Relocation Pros grams Is Stressed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In The Times of Feb. 16 appears an editorial " The Banished Shopkeeper . " The case in point is the displacement of shopkeepers on the site of the proposed Lincoln Square redevelopment . To promote new and better uses for depreciating neighborhoods is one of the purposes sought by redevelopment legislation , both state and Federal . The question is raised , however : Are existing occupants being treated fairly ? Public housing is designed to take care of displaced slum dwellers . Who is interested in the displaced shopkeepers ? The Times editorial explains that Robert Moses has pointed out that , under Title I of the Federal act , displaced business firms are eligible for special compensation . Present rulings allow up to $2,000  - -  for each commercial displacement . Residential tenants may get $150 to $200 for moving expenses . The editorial implies that if storekeepers are not eligible , under ordinary processes of eminent domain , to receive more humane treatment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law may be Less at fault than interpretation of the law . The courts have long maintained that when property is taken through eminent domain payment in currency is the only method of just compensation . Furthermore , the courts have maintained that compensation can be paid only for a physical thing taken . In putting emphasis on physical property the courts have been slow to recognize that the value of property is based upon use and that the loss of the physical property itself ( except for purposes of exploitation ) is not the principal deprivation . The value of property is the value of the use of property . Means of Livelihood The real loss suffered is the loss of a means necessary for the liveli. hood of the person or persons deprived . Physical property itself is only one factor in the means of earning livelihood . When a person or persons are deprived of a physical thing and the taking jeopardizes the livelihood of these persons , then the community also suffers a loss by the reduction of its productive capacity . A payment on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away may not be just compensation at all , for the property value lies in the going business . The writer has long pointed out that rearrangement and reorganization are the problems which we face in the redesign , replanning and rebuilding needed for the improvement of the countless neighborhoods which make up our great city . In some cases , as in the proposals foe Lincoln Square , it may seem advisable to change the uses of the neighborhood completely . In many others reorganization , redesign and rebuild . ing could be effected in which existing residents as well as existing shopkeepers could be benefited and could play an important part in the redevelopment process . During the period of readjustment it is possible to protect the property rights of those involved in existing tenancies and ownerships by a recognition that their most essential property is their right to earn a livelihood or to possess the shelter requisite for family living or for business . By the exchange of facilities , by the provision of temporary quarters , by payments for interrupted income , by the provision of equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reeomposition of rights including facilities for refinancing , it would be possible to arrange for just compensation for property , rights that may be temporarily interrupted by the replanning process , Manua C.

Force To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The use of an emergency military force by the United Nations io prevent belligerent action between Israel and Egypt established a. precedent which points to the need for a permanent military . The classic complaint against the U. N. has been that its member nations refuse to part with one iota of their sovereignty . And it is equally well known that the U. N. can not hope to survive in a world torn by friction and factions , unless it possesses a military force of its own  --  an armed force whose members owe allegiance only to the U. N. The present arrangement is unsatisfactory , both as to its size and as to the uncertainty of its tenure . India has threatened to withdraw its contingent because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations are free to withdraw their contingents whenever they choose , how secure can the U. N , Emergency Force be ? A permanent military force is the only sensible arrangement . WILLIAM WEINSTEIN . New York , March 5 , 1957.
